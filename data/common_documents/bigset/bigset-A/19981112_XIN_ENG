<HEADLINE> China, Japan Should Establish Friendly Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China and Japan should establish
a "friendly cooperative partnership," Chinese ambassador to Japan
Chen Jian said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The two countries should "establish a friendly cooperative
partnership which will contribute to peace and development in Asia
and the world," Chen said at the Japanese National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were made two weeks ahead of Chinese President
Jiang Zemin's visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on November 25, is
the first Chinese president to visit Japan. His visit will mark
the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Peace and
Friendship between the People's Republic of China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
"Generally speaking, China-Japan ties are good," Chen said,
adding that the two countries still need to boost exchanges,
deepen mutual understanding and mutual trust and expand
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to resolve issues obstructing a better Chinese-Japanese
relationship, Chen said Japan should adopt a clearer attitude
toward history and the Taiwan issue.
</P>
<P>
Chen said that China has urged Japan to incorporate "clear
expressions" of its position on the 1937-1945 Chinese-Japanese war
and on the Taiwan issue in a joint statement slated to be issued
by Jiang and Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Future relations between the two countries will be bright, Chen
noted, so long as they adhere to the principle of not pursuing
hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region, and Japan sticks to the
spirit of its peaceful Constitution and continues to walk along the
road of peaceful development.
</P>
<P>
Asked why China is opposed to a planned theater missile defense
(TMD) system, Chen said that China does not want to see a new
arms race in the region, and advocates that the region's
peace and stability should be maintained through bilateral and
multilateral dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador also reiterated that China will not
devaluate the yuan and expressed the hope that the Japanese yen
will recover stability soon and contribute to helping the
economies of East Asia.

<HEADLINE> Indian Airports, Seaports Hardly Hit By Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Operations at international
airports, cargo complexes, border check posts, and seaports across
India have been hit hard for the second day Wednesday as over
100,000 officials and revenue employees continue their strike.
</P>
<P>
The Press Trust of India (PTI) reported that the officials and
employees of income tax, central excise and customs departments of
the ports demand higher pay scales.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted the Coordinating Committee of Federations
(COC) in the Revenue Department as accusing the government of
being penny wise and pound foolish.
</P>
<P>
Not only was the government losing a revenue of 5 billion
rupees (approximately 125 million U.S. dollars) per day due to the
strike but flight tickets to smuggling-prone countries were being
sold at a premium, COC joint convenor K. K. N. Kutty told
reporters Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Customs authorities, however, maintained that the overall
situation was normal across the country and that over 95 percent
of shipments, both import and export, were cleared on the first
day of the strike Tuesday in Delhi itself.
</P>
<P>
Delhi Air Cargo Commissioner, Dalbir Singh said that over 80
million rupees (about 2 million U.S. dolllars) of revenue had been
collected on the first two days of the three-day strike.

<HEADLINE> Belgium Offers Aid to Hurricane Mitch Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Belgium on Wednesday offered
50 million Belgian francs (1.5 million U.S. dollars) worth of
humanitarian assistance to central American countries ravaged by
Hurricane Mitch.
</P>
<P>
The aid will cover reconstruction projects in Nicaragua,
Honduras, Salvador and Guatemala, according to Reginald Moreels,
secretary of state for cooperation and development.
</P>
<P>
Belgium also offered 20 tons of medicine and medical supplies
to be airlifted to the region most severely hit by the
hurricane.
</P>
<P>
Moreels said Belgium's offer was aimed to bolster the European
Union's humanitarian assistance to the region.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission announced a day earlier that it had
garnered a total of 101.8 million ECU (111.98 million U.S.
dollars) for Central America.
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 71 million ECU came from the European Union
member states and 30.8 million from the commission itself.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Mitch triggered floods and mud-slides that raised
havoc with the Central American countries, especially in Honduras
and Nicaragua, where 26,000 people were killed or missing and
another 3 million were left homeless.

<P>
BRUSSELS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Belgium commemorated on
Wednesday the 80th anniversary of the signing of the Armistice
Treaty that ended World War I.
</P>
<P>
King Albert II, Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene and other
government officials laid wreaths at the tomb of the unknown soldier
and honored some 30 veterans who had fought the war that killed
8.5 million people in Europe between 1914 and 1918.
</P>
<P>
Queen Elizabeth II of Britain and Irish President Mary McAleese
joined the Belgian king and queen later in the day for
commemorative ceremonies at the Belgian battlefields of Ypres and
Messines Ridge.
</P>
<P>
Some 300,000 British soldiers died around Ypres while 50,000
Irish soldiers were killed in Messines where a `peace tower' was
unveiled to commemorate the dead.
</P>
<P>
The battle at Messines Ridge was especially commemorated
because in June 1917, a Northern Ireland division fought side by
side with a Southern Ireland division.
</P>
<P>
The ceremony started in Belgium at eleven o'clock, the time
when the fight finally came to an end along the front-lines
between Germany and the allies 80 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Urges Iraq to Resume Cooperation with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Fayez
Tarawneh Wednesday urged Iraq to resume cooperation with the
United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM), which is in charge of
disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has no alternative in dealing with the U.N. arms
inspectors, said Tarawneh upon his return from a two-day
consultations with Saudi government about the Iraqi-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
Iraq halted all cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors on
October 31, demanding the dismissal of UNSCOM chief Richard Butler
and the lifting of U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed on Baghdad following its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990, can not be removed until U.N. arms inspectors
certify that Iraq has been free from weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council condemned the Iraqi decision and
ordered it to resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors. The
U.S. and Britain have threatened military attack to force Iraq's
compliance.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM has begun withdrawing all its non-essential staff as the
U.S. is preparing for a possible military strike.
</P>
<P>
If the standoff continues, there will be serious consequences,
Tarawneh said. But he did not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has to consider the situation and resume its cooperation
with the U.N., he said.
</P>
<P>
In February, Iraq saw a similar crisis with the U.N. after it
denied U.N. inspectors access to presidential palaces suspected of
hiding banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain massed forces in the Gulf and were
prepared to strike Iraq into obedience.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was defused later after Iraq opened the presidential
palaces for weapons inspectors under the mediation of U.N.
Secretary General Kofi Annan.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Humanitarian Program to Continue: U.N. Envoy (by Liu Jiawen) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. humanitarian program
for Iraq will continue though some non-essential staff of the
U.N. Office of the Humanitarian Coordinator for Iraq (UNOHCI) will
be "temporarily relocated," said a U.N. envoy on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Prakash Shah, representative of U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan in Iraq, said at a press conference here that about 30
officials of the UNOHCI will stay in Iraq to continue humanitarian
program.
</P>
<P>
Shah said he held a meeting with Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister
Tariq Aziz on Wednesday morning and informed him of the decision
of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) decision to withdraw all
its personnel from Iraq and the temporary relocation of some of
the non-essential UNOHCI staff.
</P>
<P>
He said Aziz told him that Iraq will not rescind its October 31
decision to halt cooperation with UNSCOM, which has overseen the
inspection of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction since 1991, unless
the U.N. Security Council takes some actions to lift the
sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains that the sanctions, imposed on Iraq after
its invasion of Kuwait, will not be removed until UNSCOM certifies
that Baghdad has eradicated all its banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
Shah said the decision to withdraw U.N. staff came "in the
background of possible military actions against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
He said he has had several meetings with Aziz over the past
four days and they discussed ways to end the current Iraq-U.N.
standoff.
</P>
<P>
"I had once again re-emphasized the need for Iraq to comply
with resolutions passed by the United Nations Security Council,"
Shah said of his meeting with Aziz.
</P>
<P>
Eric Falt, spokesman for the UNOHCI, told reporters earlier
Wednesday that the UNOHCI has received instructions from the
U.N. headquarters in New York, which asked them to leave for
Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"In view of the uncertainty surrounding the current situation
and following instructions from U.N. headquarters in New York, it
has been decided to temporarily relocate non-essential U.N. staff
to Amman, Jordan," he said.
</P>
<P>
Falt noted that "a number of core (U.N.) officials will remain
in Baghdad including the Humanitarian Coordinator and designated
security official for Iraq Hans von Sponik, who has informed the
Iraqi foreign ministry this morning of the movement which will
take place."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. withdrew about 400 non-essential personnel, including
about 100 UNSCOM staff members on Wednesday morning amid
preparations for a possible military strike by the U.S.. But the
number of UNOHCI staff that have been pulled out is not clear.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Iraq to Cooperate with UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday issued a new appeal, urging Iraq to
reverse its decision and resume cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The move came amid the United Nations Special Commission
(UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of mass
destruction is withdrawing its staff form Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued through his spokesman's office, Annan,
now visiting Morocco, strongly urged Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein and his government to rescind decisions made on August 5
and October 31 that banned U.N. arms teams from carrying out their
work.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Iraq's wish to have the sanctions lifted, Annan
said it had "maintained for a long time that it wants to see light
at the end of the tunnel."
</P>
<P>
"I also want to see the lifting of sanctions, so that Iraq can
regain its place among the community of nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi leadership's decision not to cooperate with the
United Nations Special Commission at a time when the Council was
undertaking these efforts came as a surprise to me and and, I
suspect, to all Council members," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"I therefore appeal once again to President Saddam Hussein and
Iraq's leadership to take this opportunity to resume cooperation
with UNSCOM and the IAEA (the International Atomic Energy Agency).
This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and for
the world," Annan added.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Crisis High on Regional Agenda: Moussa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi-U.N. crisis over
weapons inspections will figure high on the agenda of a meeting of
the Damascus Declaration signatory states, Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Doha, Qatar, to attend the two-day meeting
due to start later Wednesday, Moussa said that Egypt prefers and
is working for a diplomatic settlement of the standoff between
Iraq and the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Egypt, meanwhile, calls on both sides to exercise flexibility
and resumption of cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 31 to halt cooperation with UNSCOM
overseeing the elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction,
to protest at the failure of the U.N. Security Council to propose
a timetable for lifting the sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
The sanctions, imposed by the Security Council after Iraq's
1990 invasion of Kuwait, can not be lifted until UNSCOM certifies
that Iraq has destroyed all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council has condemned Iraq's defiance and
ordered it to resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors. The
U.S. said that all options, including military action, are on the
table to force Iraq to rescind the decision.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Moussa argued that the Iraqi people should
be given the chance to "see the light at the end of the tunnel" to
be free from the crippling sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Moussa said issues concerning the Arab world, the Middle East
peace process, relations between Arab countries and non-Arab
countries in the region will also be discussed in the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council,
namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, signed the Damascus Declaration after the 1991 Gulf
War to create a mechanism aimed at guaranteeing security in the
Gulf region.

<HEADLINE> Northern Ireland's Maze Prison Criticized as Unsafe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Maze Prison, home of some
of the most notorious terrorists in Northern Ireland, was
condemned as "unsafe" for inmates or staff in a report issued on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report was issued by Sir David Ramsbotham, Chief Inspector
of Prisons for England and Wales, following a number of security
lapses at the jail.
</P>
<P>
The report, which contains 143 recommendations, was ordered
after the 1997 murder of Loyalist Volunteer Force chief Billy
Wright inside the prison, the discovery of a tunnel and the escape
of an IRA prisoner dressed as a woman.
</P>
<P>
Officers and staff live in constant fear of death. Twenty-nine
prison warders have been killed by paramilitaries while serving at
the Maze.
</P>
<P>
If the Northern Ireland peace agreement goes as planned, the
Maze, which has been dubbed "The University of Terrorism," will be
closed by the end of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
By that time all the 400 paramilitary prisoners eligible for
release under the terms of the peace agreement will be gone.
</P>
<P>
Director General of Northern Ireland Prison Service Robin
Halward said more should have been done to support staff in the
prison.
</P>
<P>
The Maze is situated close to Lisburn, County Antrim, and covers an
area of more than 200 acres inside a perimeter fence measuring 2.2
kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Two months ago Maze prison housed 473 prisoners. Now its
population is down to 297 under the accelerated release program of
the Northern Ireland peace accord.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Oskar Lafontaine, Germany's new
Finance Minister, wants the E.U.'s highest Post, reports here said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Informed sources in the Social Democratic Party (SPD), which
Lafontaine leads, said he may be making plans to succeed outgoing
E.U. Commission President Jacques Santer of Luxembourg. His future
ambitions have also been speculated about in other European
capitals.
</P>
<P>
A report in the latest edition of the German weekly Die Zeit
said that "a member of the Bonn government" has already held
confidential talks with his French counterpart about a replacement
for Santer who is set to retire in the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
No names were mentioned by Die Zeit, but informed sources said
there were clear indications that the participants of a dinner in
Paris were Lafontaine himself and French Finance Minister
Dominique Strauss-Kahn.
</P>
<P>
The paper said the German side had sought to establish the
French reaction to a nomination from Bonn, and that Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder was informed about the meeting.
</P>
<P>
It was noted that Lafontaine in recent months has frequently
and with admiration mentioned the name of former E.U. Commission
president Jacques Delors, a Socialist, in public speeches.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said that the question of a replacement for Santer
was expected to be settled during the first six months of 1999
while Germany holds the presidency of the E.U.
</P>
<P>
News from Brussels reported, some E.U. diplomats said that"if
Germany decides that it wants the Post, other E.U. countries will
find it difficult to say no".

<HEADLINE> Transactions at Tanzania Stock Market Hit Record </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Transactions of shares
at the Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange (DSE), the sole one in
Tanzania, hit a record Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzania Breweries Limited (TBL) shares continued to rally
the stock exchange as a record turnover of 49,829,000 Shillings
(about 74,000 U.S. Dollars) was registered in the morning for
73,000 TBL shares in 29 deals.
</P>
<P>
Both numbers of shares traded and deals were the highest to be
recorded since the stock exchange opened in April this year.
</P>
<P>
"The transactions have been brisk," Robert C. Mathu, a
technical advisor, told Xinhua at the stock exchange soon after
it was closed.
</P>
<P>
The TBL shares opened at 730 Shillings per share before
touching a new record high of 740 Shillings per share.
</P>
<P>
However, the TBL shares closed at the day's low price of 660
Shillings per share, a nine percent drop from the previous price,
as supply clearly outstripped demand.
</P>
<P>
After opening at 730 Shillings for 2,900 shares in two deals,
the blue chip stock actively traded 13,100 shares at the day's
high of 740 Shillings per share in 11 deals before the market
started correcting at 720 Shillings for 1,700 shares, 710
Shillings for 3,550 shares, 700 Shillings for 600 shares, 690
Shillings for 850 shares, 680 Shillings for 100 shares, 670
Shillings for 100 shares before closing at 660 Shillings for
7,200.
</P>
<P>
No transaction was recorded for the shares of the Tanzania
Oxygen Limited (TOL).
</P>
<P>
TOL Ltd., a leading manufacturer and distributor of industrial
and medical gases, was the first public company listed on the
stock exchange. TBL came on board in August to make the shares
market more lively.
</P>
<P>
At the close of the session, 7,750 TBL shares were on offer at
prices ranging from 680 to 750 Shillings per share while 100 TBL
shares were on bid at 640 Shillings per share. On TOL counter,
there were 320 shares on offer at 400 Shillings per share in
three lots with no bids.
</P>
<P>
For the past weeks, TBL has taken the limelight from TOL,
especially after the latter's board chairman Felix Mrema
announced late last month that the company may register losses up
to 600 million Shillings during the full financial year due to
mismanagement for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
To some extent, the crisis has affected the trading of the
firm's shares and put potential buyers of the shares on hold,
economic analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The Dar es Salaam Stock Exchange opens once a week, on
Wednesdays, since only two companies have been listed so far.

<HEADLINE> Inflation to Rise as Growth Slides, Says UK Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) - UK inflation is expected to rise
slightly in 1999 before easing to its current level of 2.5 percent
in two years, the Bank of England said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Bank said in its quarterly inflation report that
UK GDP will slow to one percent in 1999, at the bottom of the
1-1.5 percent range forecast by chancellor Gordon Brow last week.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say the report reduces the chances of another cut in
interest rates in December but the trend in rates remains downward
in coming months.
</P>
<P>
The Bank complained that wages data is becoming difficult to
interpret and increasingly volatile. It said: "There is
considerable uncertainty about the path of inflation."
</P>
<P>
The introduction of a national minimum wage next April is
expected to contribute to the rise in inflation slightly above the
Bank's 2.5 percent target.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank reiterated its tough stance on inflation
saying stopping it varying too much from the government's 2.5
percent target will remain the priority next year.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler had ordered to withdraw all arms staff in
Iraq, his spokesman said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ewen Buchanan, spokesman for the Untied Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) in charge of dismantling Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction, said Butler had ordered to withdraw all UNSCOM
personnel from Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Buchanan said many of the inspectors, helicopter pilots,
communication experts and other staff would be in Bahrain and
remain ready to resume their full work in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
UNSCOM"s move is widely seen here as a precautionary measure
amid the reports that the Untied States was preparing to launch a
military strike against Iraq.

WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday that the U.S. is prepared to act if the Iraqi
government does not resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons

</P>
<P>

The best way for the Iraqi government to have the sanctions

<HEADLINE> 30 Ministers Discuss U.N. Environment Body Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Environment ministers from 30
states gathered at a high-level meeting in Buenos Aires of
Argentina over the ongoing reform of the Nairobi-based U.N.
Environment Program (UNEP), a UNEP news release said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
UNEP Executive Director Klaus Toepfer said at the on-going
meeting of the UNEP High-level Committee of Ministers and
Officials that the process of restructuring the organization was
almost complete.
</P>
<P>
"UNEP's restructuring is a strategic response to the changing
institutional, programmatic and budgetary conditions. It is not a
reactive or a mechanical gesture, or a public relations
exercise," the news release issued in the Kenyan capital quoted
Toepfer as saying.
</P>
<P>
"We want our share-holders, partners and constituents to know
that we are making every effort to be focused on our mandate, to
respond better to countries' needs, and to be cost-effective," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Toepfer said the "good progresses" have been made by UNEP in
the fields of offering more support to Africa, developing an
emergency response capacity, enforcing early warning and
assessment functions and industry and technology transfer.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the ministers welcomed the strengthened role
of UNEP as an implementing agency of the Global Environment
Facility (GEF).
</P>
<P>
They have agreed to consider at the next meeting of UNEP's
Governing Council, a plan of action aimed at enhancing UNEP's
intervention in the GEF.
</P>
<P>
The 36-member High-level Committee of Ministers and Officials
was established last year with the mandate to consider the
international environmental agenda and to make reform and policy
recommendations to the UNEP.

<HEADLINE> U.K. Trade Mission to Visit Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A British trade mission
will arrive here Thursday for a week-long tour of Tanzania to
explore business opportunities or reinforce existing contacts,
British commerce officials said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The team made up of the delegates of 10 British companies will
visit Tanzanian firms during November 12-17, officials at the
Commercial Section of the British High Commission told Xinhua in
Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
The mission will come after making a business trip to Kenya,
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
The British trade mission, the third this year, will be led by
the Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, one of the largest in
Britain, which paid a successful visit to Tanzania last November.
</P>
<P>
In April, the Industrial Development Board of Northern Ireland
mission visited Tanzania, followed by the Sussex Chamber of
Commerce delegation in July.
</P>
<P>
The Birmingham Chamber of Commerce, established in 1813,
provides a vital role in helping the business community in
Britain to pursue overseas opportunities.
</P>
<P>
David Frost of the chamber will be accompanying the
representatives of the wide-ranging companies as the Mission
Manager.
</P>
<P>
British trade officials said companies taking part in the
mission include Ashville Trading, which provides boarding school
education and English language training; Huntleigh Healthcare,
manufacturers of textile recyclers; Orchard International, which
produces domestic appliances and Property Owners of London Ltd.,
which engages in project management and property investment.
</P>
<P>
Other companies include Red Dragon Rail, which produces
rehabilitated and new railway rolling stock, Regentsgold (Design)
Ltd., manufacturers of reproduction furniture; Skatoskalo, a
producer of internal tube cleaning equipment, as well as Tansales
(London) Ltd., which makes electrical goods for construction
industry.
</P>
<P>
Britain remains one of Tanzania's leading trading partners.
Statistics released by the British High Commission indicated that
the European country's exports to Tanzania in 1997 amounted to 77
million Pounds while Tanzania exported goods valued at 33 million
Pounds to Britain.

<HEADLINE> Greece Supports Cyprus' EU Accession Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A senior Greek official warned
that if the European Union (EU) does not adopt Cyprus on account
of the Cyprus issue, the Greek Parliament would not ratify the
accession of the other five candidate countries.
</P>
<P>
"If ... the only reason they do not accept Cyprus is that the
Cyprus problem is not settled, then it is certain that the Greek
Parliament would not be able to ratify the accession of the other
countries because this would be unfair and unacceptable," said
Greek Alternate Foreign Minister George Papandreou on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Cyprus state radio, Papandreou said that
obstacles placed by some EU members do not facilitate efforts for
a settlement in the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to a joint statement submitted to the European
Commission on Monday, one day prior to the opening of substantive
accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by France, Germany and Netherlands, said
a political solution in Cyprus is urgent and should go before the
east Mediterranean island joins the EU.
</P>
<P>
"The course of the process of negotiations will give rise to a
series of problems which originate from the specific situation in
Cyprus," the statement, also backed by Italy, said.
</P>
<P>
The EU started accession talks with the Greek Cypriot dominated
Cypriot government last March, a move strongly opposed by Turkish
Cypriots in the north of the island and their supporter Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Papandreou noted that the start of substantive negotiations
"proves that Cyprus is moving forward," but some EU members'
negotiating tactic does not facilitate efforts for a settlement of
the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the momentum created by Cyprus' EU accession
course should not be lost as the Cypriot government backs efforts
toward a solution on the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkey landed its
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Greek coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway state in
northern Cyprus, which was recognized only by Turkey.

MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Japanese government
spokesman said here Wednesday that the next 800 million U.S.
dollars tranche of a 1.5 billion dollar Japanese package will be
extended to Russia very soon.
</P>
<P>
Sadaaki Numata, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
spokesman, said the loan will be released in just a few weeks, not
months, Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
Numata said Obuchi will confirm Tokyo's support for Russian
reforms in his meetings with Russian leaders during his three-day
official visit, the first one by a Japanese premier to Russia in
25 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that Japan is awaiting a response from Russia to its
proposals on ways to resolve the issue over the disputed Kuril
islands.
</P>
<P>
"What is important is that the two sides treat this issue very
seriously. We sincerely hope that this process will move forward,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Japan can resume demanding the initial return of
two instead of all the four disputed isles, Numata said that most
Japanese want all the four rather than any other number back.
</P>
<P>
A sandwich is no sandwich if there is no meat in it, Interfax
quoted the spokesman as saying.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Trade Union on Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade
Union (ZCTU) staged a one-day mass strike Wednesday to force the
government to reverse a 68 percent fuel price hike.
</P>
<P>
In Harare, capital of this southern African country, the
central business district was deserted as most shops and banks
were closed. There were no signs of violence.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of workers in the satellite town of Chitungwize,
about 30 kilometers outside Harare, took heed of the ZCTU call to
stay away from work.
</P>
<P>
Armed riot police and Zimbabwe national army soldiers closely
monitored the situation in which scores of people gathered in
groups as the sprouting town's shops were closed.
</P>
<P>
In Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, industry and
commerce was at a standstill Wednesday as the majority of workers
stayed at home.
</P>
<P>
In the country's eastern city of Mutare, the downtown area was
quiet and deserted with shops closed while the police had running
battles with groups of rowdy youths in Sakubva high density
suburb.
</P>
<P>
However, Assistant Commissioner Joshua Takawira said the
situation in Mutare was "under control."
</P>
<P>
In the central city of Gweru, all shops, banks, filling
stations, offices as well as factories in the industrial areas
remained closed as workers did not report for work, or owners of
the businesses premises kept them under lock and key in fear of
an outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government has indefinitely postponed the
tripartite meeting with labor and business, which had been called
for Wednesday to discuss urgent economic matters.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Holds Consultations on Iraqi Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu held consultations on Wednesday with his
cabinet ministers and advisors on the brewing Iraqi crisis, the
Prime Minister's Office said.
</P>
<P>
The office said that the meeting marked the first round of
consultations that Netanyahu has held on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Iraq announced on October 31 that it halted cooperation with
the United Nations Special Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM)
until the Security Council considers lifting the sanctions imposed
on Iraq since its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolutions, the sanctions cannot be
lifted until arms inspectors verify that Iraq has eliminated all
its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has condemned the Iraqi decision and
ordered it to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors. The
U.S. and Britain threatened military attack to force Iraq to
change its non-compliance policy.
</P>
<P>
Israel supports the U.S. policy on the Iraq issue, but the
U.S. wants Israel to distant itself from direct involvement in the
conflicts because of Israel's troubled relations with other Arab
and Islamic nations in this region.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen wound up a tour of
consultations last week with leaders of the Gulf region on the
issue and National Security Advisor Sandy Berger made a similar
trip to Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The Arab and European governments are offering little public
support for a military attack on Iraq, however.
</P>
<P>
Washington reportedly announced Wednesday that it has
authorized its diplomats both in Israel and Kuwait to return the
U.S as a security precaution due to the Iraqi crisis.

<P>
ATHENS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of Greek students and
teachers from both secondary schools and universities Wednesday
took to the street in central Athens to demonstrate against the
government's educational reforms.
</P>
<P>
During the demonstration, which caused major traffic problems
and damages to a number of cars, police arrested one student after
some protesters threw rocks, coins and bottles at the Education
Ministry building.
</P>
<P>
Similar marches also took place in other major cities around
the country.
</P>
<P>
Greek government spokesman Dimitris Reppas quoted the Education
Minister Gerasimos Arsenis as saying that the protests were
unjustified and motivated by political point-scoring and by those
in the private education sector who stood to lose through the
ministry's reforms, but Reppas admitted that there were some
problems such as a lack of textbooks, not enough teaching staff
and too many students in some schools.

<P>
LAGOS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Nigerians are combating
African swine fever in the country with the "logistic support"
offered by the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria (NAN) quoted Shami A-Shami, FAO
country representative, as saying in capital Abuja that the
eradication campaign would cost millions of Dollars using a
"systematic and technically oriented approach", and expressed
FAO's commitment to help combat the scourge.
</P>
<P>
A-Shami noted that the campaign had been successful in states
such as Oyo and Ogun, where the incidence of the disease had
dropped noticeably, and stressed the urgent need to expand
control measures to other states.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized the need to extend the campaign to the entire
West African sub-region, saying that the epidemic had assumed a
"regional dimension", having made serious incursions into
countries like Benin Republic, Togo and Burkina Faso.

<HEADLINE> More Relief Food to Rwanda by WFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
will double the amount of relief food to northwest Rwanda as
humanitarian situation reaches alarming levels.
</P>
<P>
Six months ago, WFP was feeding 100,000 internally displaced
persons in northwest Rwanda, but now it has to feed four times
the number, Xinhua learned here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Scores of Rwandan families have fled their homes in the
northern part of the country in an effort to escape sporadic and
violent rebel attacks which have claimed countless lives over the
past few months.
</P>
<P>
Estimatedly, 600,000 residents in northern Rwanda have
abandoned their homes and become displaced since mid 1998, with
some 60 percent living in camps near military posts for
protection, a press release of the WFP said.
</P>
<P>
"Some of these people are living in the open air, with no
shelter from rain which began in October, and in places with poor
sanitation conditions where there is little access to clean
water. As a result, large amount of them are getting sick,"
Gerard Van Dijk, a WFP representative in Rwanda was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has been sending some 2,000 tons of food to feed the
displaced each month and will now, as part of a joint U.N.
intervention, start to double this amount in the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that all of WFP's food supplies to the northwest
of Rwanda are under military escort.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure that the food reaches the displaced, the
agency will work with the U.N. security cell and local security
personnel to increase security arrangements and double the number
of weekly escorted convoys.
</P>
<P>
Last month, the WFP distributed roughly 6,000 tons of relief
food to 520,000 people in Rwanda and half of this assistance went
to some 360,000 internally displaced in the northwest.
</P>
<P>
The Rome-based WFP, the U.N. front-line agency in the fight
against global hunger, operates in 76 countries around the world.
Last year its relief workers fed 53 million people.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Cabinet Discusses Standoff with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi cabinet convened an
emergency session Wednesday evening to discuss its standoff with
the United Nations over weapons inspections, the Iraqi News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, chaired by President Saddam Hussein, discussed the
possibility of the "U.S. and Israeli military aggression" against
Iraq, said INA.
</P>
<P>
The session came as the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) for
disarming Iraq has pulled out all its non-essential personnel,
about 90 people, from Iraq and around 130 U.N. humanitarian staff
have been withdrawn to Amman, Jordan.
</P>
<P>
INA said the cabinet meeting discussed emergency measures that
will be taken should the United States launch air strikes against
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The meeting said the U.S. military threat against Iraq "is
unjustifiable and runs counter to the U.N. Charter and
international laws and norms, and to the U.N. Security Council
resolutions which stipulate that Iraq's territorial integrity and
political independence should be respected."
</P>
<P>
The cabinet meeting said the Iraqi people have shown their
will to frustrate the U.S. and Israeli military aggression.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi leadership on October 31 decided to halt all forms of
cooperation with UNSCOM until the Security Council begins moving
to lift the economic sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolutions, the sanctions can not
be lifted until arms inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated
all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on November 5 condemned the Iraqi decision
and urged it to resume cooperation with weapons inspectors, but
Iraq refuses to back down.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain threatened to use force against
Iraq if diplomatic means fail.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's massive withdrawal of the U.N. staff from Baghdad
is viewed as a sign that the U.S. is preparing for military
actions against Iraq.

CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Attorney-General
Counselor Hisham Saraya has ordered that two brothers be tried at
the Higher Security Court on charges of possessing and trading
explosives.
</P>

The two suspects, identified as Mohsen Sobhy Abed, a commerce

April when they put up a hand grenade for sale in Beni Suef, 120

Egypt has tightened security measures after Islamic extremists

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Minister of Internal
Affairs Tom Butime revealed that tea has become the country's
second largest foreign exchange earner.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks when opening a tea forum at the
International Conference Center here Wednesday afternoon, Radio Uganda
reported.
</P>
<P>
Butime said the foreign exchange earnings from tea exports have
increased from 2.8 million U.S. Dollars in 1986 to 24 million Dollars
so far this year, next to those from coffee which account for 60
percent of the country's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
The forum, which was jointly organized by East Africa Tea
Traders Association and Uganda Tea Association (UTA),
discussed problems faced by the tea industry in the region.
</P>
<P>
Butime said the decline of tea industry in Uganda was a direct
responsibility of past regimes, adding that currently the recovery
of the industry was a result of economic policies of the National
Resistance Movement government.
</P>
<P>
Peter Roland, the UTA chairman, said that tea production in
Uganda has been on an upward trend but lamented low labor
productivity, high costs of power and poor roads as some key factors
retarding the smooth productivity of tea industry in this East
African country.

<HEADLINE> Kirghiz National Currency Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The Kirghiz som fell to 29-32
against one U.S. dollar Wednesday in exchange offices and
commercial banks, down from the official exchange rate of 24.7
soms to one dollar.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the U.S. dollar has soared from Monday, when the
former Soviet republic's central bank announced that it would no
longer interfere in trading in the inter-bank exchange market to
try to prop up the national currency, Interfax reported Wednesday
in a dispatch from Bishkek, the Kirghiz capital.
</P>
<P>
However, trading volumes have went down sharply, as few banks
want to part with their dollars.
</P>
<P>
The weaker som portends a serious economic crisis in the
country, Interfax quoted Daniyar Usenov, chairman of the
parliament's Tax, Customs and Banking Committee, Daniyar Usenov,
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The government has been trying to defend the national currency
with the help of foreign loans, he said, noting that Kirghizstan's
foreign debts stand at 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Usenov urged the government to come up with a plan to stabilize
the situation, pooling the expertise of bankers, National Bank
experts, prominent economists and parliament deputies.
</P>
<P>
"Otherwise, Kirghizstan will find itself on the verge of
economic disaster by the end of February 1999," he warned.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Tries to Improve Tax Framework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has set up a task force
to try to improve the tax framework to make it more responsive
and tax-payer friendly.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president Christon Tembo said here Wednesday that though
the government still depends on taxes to finance its expenditure
it has listened to the cry of the business community concerning
high taxes.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the annual general meeting for the Zambia Association
for Chambers of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI), he said that the long term
solution to the problem of high taxes lies in the realization of
vast potential in agriculture and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Tembo stressed the need for dialog between the government and
the business community so that the economic ills facing the country
can be resolved by all stakeholders.
</P>
<P>
ZACCI Chairman George Chabwera said Zambia's economy will not
stablize as long as the government continues trying to implement
programs imposed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
He said the gross domestic product will reduce by three
percent this year instead of increasing by five percent projected
in the budget.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government should review its relations
with IMF which has failed to heal troubled economies anywhere in
the world.
</P>
<P>
Currently there is no investor confidence in Zambia, he said,
adding the high tax scares away investors.
</P>
<P>
Chabwera urged the government to do away with the IMF market
driven exchange rates and revise duty rates to promote
investment.
</P>
<P>
On foreign debts, he said forgiveness of the debt will not
yield any results if there are no plans to channel the resources
into productive sectors of the economy.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Wednesday decided to suspend his North Africa tour
to return to the U.N. headquarters in New York due to the Iraqi
crisis, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard announced.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard told a press conference that "the Secretary-General has
now decided to suspend his current official visit to... North
Africa and he will fly back to New York tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Annan will be in New York to monitor the U.N. Security
Council's consultations on the Iraqi crisis and follow the latest
development of the situation in Iraq, he said.
</P>
<P>
Over the last 24 hours, Annan has made telephone contacts with
the U.S. Government, he said, but he declined to give more
details.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Wednesday, Annan, currently on a visit to Morocco,
issued a statement through his spokesman's office, calling upon
Iraq to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors as most U.N. staff
was being pulled out of Baghdad in anticipation of possible U.S.
attacks.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he was "saddened and burdened" by the Iraqi decision
not to cooperate with U.N. weapons inspectors and "strongly urged
(Iraqi) President Saddam Hussein and the Iraqi Government to
rescind its decision and resume immediate cooperation with" U.N.
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"This would be good for the Iraqi people, for the region and
for the world," he said.
</P>
<P>
The only way to lift sanctions against Iraq is "for Iraq to
fully cooperate with U.N. Security Council," he said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday morning, the Security Council decided to
convene an unscheduled closed-door meeting on Iraq at the request
of Russia, who intends to get an explanation from U.N. chief
inspector Richard Butler why he withdrew most U.N. inspectors out
of Baghdad, the Iraqi capital.
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), told
a press conference here on Wednesday that he made the withdrawal
decision on Tuesday night on the basis of "strong recommendation
from the U.S. Government and the increasing hostility" towards
inspectors in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said the withdrawal meant a temporary relocation of
non-essential U.N. personnel to Amman, capital of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Eckhard said that the withdrawal does not
necessarily mean the suspension of the "Oil-for-food" program in
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Annan defused the last major weapon-inspecting crisis and
averted possible U.S. strikes by reaching an agreement in Baghdad
last February intended to ensure U.N. inspector teams unfettered
access to all sites.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq's Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan (PUK) leader Jalal Talabani said here on Wednesday that
his party will support Turkey in fighting Turkey's outlawed
Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Talabani made the remark at a press conference before winding
up his five-day contacts with his rival Iraq's Kurdish Democratic
Party (KDP) Chairman Massoud Barzani and Turkish high-ranking
officials in Ankara.
</P>
<P>
He said that the PUK and Turkey had opened up a new period in

Turkey has long accused the pro-Iranian PUK of supporting the
PKK which has been fighting a separatist war in southeastern
Turkey since August 1984.

Talabani said that "We never deny the role of Turkey in the
region," adding that "It is decided that the problems between the
KDP and the PUK must be solved within the framework of the Ankara
Peace Process."
</P>
<P>
Turkey was upset by a peace accord signed by the KDP and the
PUK on power sharing and future elections in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Turkey feared that the KDP-KUP agreement, signed on September
17 in Washington, could lead to a Kurdish state in northern Iraq,
which would further encourage the PKK activities in southeastern
Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Both Barzani and Talabani have promised Turkey that they will
join hands to fight the PKK and maintain peace and stability in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Most of the PKK guerrillas have taken shelter in northern Iraq,
which became a power vacuum after Baghdad lost control over it
following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
The PKK militants have used the areas as a spring board for
cross-border attacks on targets inside Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Urges Iraqi Flexibility in Standoff with U.N. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
Wednesday called on Iraq to show flexibility and use wisdom to
defuse the ongoing standoff with the U.N. over weapons inspections
in a bid to save the Iraqi people from military strikes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the official Middle East News Agency,
Mubarak urged Iraq to continue to carry out the United Nations
Security Council resolutions to avoid complicating the situation.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided last month to halt cooperation with the U.N.
Special Commission (UNSCOM), charged with eliminating Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened military attack to force
Baghdad to resume cooperation with UNSCOM, which must certify that
Iraq has destroyed its weapons of mass destruction before the
Security Council can lift the sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak termed the situation in Iraq as serious and called on
the Iraqi government to exert efforts to avert possible military
strikes to safeguard the country.
</P>
<P>
He said he has been following up developments of the crisis and
"find it my duty to call attention to the seriousness" of the
standoff between Iraq and UNSCOM.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian leader warned that "the use of force (against
Iraq) will have grave consequences on the Iraqi people in the
first place."
</P>
<P>
Egypt has made it clear that it opposes the military option in
solving the Iraqi crisis, calling for diplomatic and political
means to defuse the tensions.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopia Accepts OAU Peace Proposal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Foreign
Minister Seyoum Mesfin announced Wednesday afternoon that his
country has formally accepted the Organization of African Unity
(OAU) proposal for peace regarding its border conflict with
Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
Briefing the diplomatic community in the capital, Seyoum
said: "Prime Minister (Meles Zenawi) has now decided to
communicate to the chairman of the high-level delegation
Ethiopia's formal and definitive acceptance of the OAU proposal
for peace."
</P>
<P>
He said the OAU proposal is acceptable to Ethiopia because it
does not aim to reward aggression and it is principled
essentially on the resolution adopted on the 34th Assembly of the
OAU Heads of State and Government.
</P>
<P>
The elements of the proposal are consistent with Ethiopia's
preparedness to contribute to a successful resolution of the
dispute, he said.
</P>
<P>
Seyoum said Ethiopia has always given preference for a
peaceful way of resolving the crisis and refused to agree to
proposals designed to appease the aggressor and to reward
aggression.
</P>
<P>
"We have been consistent in following these two principles to
a fault and we intend to continue along this path without fail,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the Ouagadougou meeting has clearly demonstrated that
the ball is now in the Eritrean court.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Ethiopia anticipates war with Eritrea, Seyoum said:
"We have never been in a rush to go to war with Eritrea. And we
still are not."
</P>
<P>
He said Ethiopia will wait and see if the international
community is ready to put pressure on Eritrea to be committed to
peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former U.S. National Security Adviser Anthony lake
arrived here Wednesday to facilitate a peaceful solution to the
six-month Ethio-Eritrean conflict. He is expected to meet
Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and other high-level
officials.
</P>
<P>
Lake's previous visit to Ethiopia was on October 8 of this
year.

<HEADLINE> High Fertility Affects Health of Mothers, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The health of mothers and
children is adversely affected by high fertility, a common
phenomenon in Uganda, a minister said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Philip Byaruhanga, State Minister for Health, said this in a
speech at the mid-term review meeting of Uganda's population
programs funded by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA),
Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
"The risks of maternal, infant and child morbidity and
mortality increase with pregnancies that are too early, too
frequent, too many and too late," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Short breast-feeding durations (less than 18 months) have
adverse effects on the health of the children and have serious
implications for child survival," the minister added.
</P>
<P>
With limited resources, high fertility depresses savings and
makes it increasingly difficult for most families to adequately
feed, clothe, house and educate their children.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, frequent child bearing deprives the mother of the
opportunity for gainful employment and career advancement, the
report noted.
</P>
<P>
Early child bearing has some socio-economic and health
consequences. Teenage pregnancies among single mothers who lack
resources can affect the initial development and growth of their
children.
</P>
<P>
It also encourages the school drop-out phenomenon and acts as
a barrier to the educational and career advancement of women and
their future economic independence, the official was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the UNFPA said it will spend over 24 million
U.S. Dollars on Uganda's population programs in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Bulgaria Determined to Cooperate in Their </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 11 (Xinhua) - Romania and Bulgaria are
determined to coordinate their efforts to speed up reform, which
they consider as absolutely necessary both for their own progress
and their integration in European and Euro-Atlantic structures.
</P>
<P>
The stand were expressed on Wednesday by Romanian President
Emil Constantinescu and the visiting Bulgarian President Petar
Stoyanov.
</P>
<P>
Another separation of the candidate countries would be
premature right now, considering that a first EU expansion is
likely to occur over 2005-2006, the two presidents said after
their last round of talk, answering reporters' questions on the
two countries' stand on joining the EU. Such a division might have
discouraging effects on the two peoples, who are currently making
great sacrifices, they stressed, adding that besides difficulties
every state has to face while on a reform process, both Romania
and Bulgaria had also to overcome those caused by the Yugoslav
crisis, as they had been the most affected countries following
observance of the 1992-1995 embargo, while right now the crisis in
Kosovo keeps foreign investors and financial circles away from the
area.
</P>
<P>
As it was reported earlier, Romania and Bulgaria were ranked
at the bottom in the European Commission Report released last
week, an analysis of the latest evolution of candidate countries
for admission to the European Union.
</P>
<P>
According to Stoianov, objective reasons, such as the world
economic crisis, the Russian crisis and the conflict in Kosovo
should make the two countries double their efforts for integration
in parallel with sustained efforts aimed at strengthening regional
stability.
</P>
<P>
The two heads of state were keen to notice that Romania and
Bulgaria should not enter competition with each other in order to
achieve these wishes. On the contrary, they should support one
another.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov Wednesday ended his
two-day official visit to Romania after having exchanged views
over bilateral, regional and international issues with his
Romanian counterpart Emil Constantinescu, the Prime Minister Radu
Vasile and Chairmens of the two chambers of the Parliament Petre
Roman and Ion Diaconescu. It was Stoyanov's first visit to Romania
since he was elected president at the end of 1996. During the
visit, the two countries signed five accords in domains such as
science, culture, tourism, transport, agriculture and customs,
which have completed the juridical frame of cooperation between
our countries.

<HEADLINE> Compaq to Develop Direct-Sales Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Compaq Computer, the
largest manufacturer of personal computers in the world, will
start selling its machines directly by telephone and over the
Internet at prices lower than those now charged by local dealers,
sources close to the company said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The aggressive schedule will help the Huston-based computer
maker reach the fast-growing small and medium-size business PC
market.
</P>
<P>
The company is taking the step to fend off a potent rival, Dell
Computer, which has always marketed its machines directly and now
threatens Compaq's market lead.
</P>
<P>
Compaq has been losing market share to Dell, PC market analysts
said. The No. 3 computer giant has grown faster and been more
profitable because of the efficiency of its direct-scales model.
</P>
<P>
Meeting the challenge from Dell, Compaq adopted direct-sales
policy to its largest customers earlier this year after it
acquired Digital Equipment Corp., which has a large direct-sales
force.
</P>
<P>
The company tried to bypass dealers with an online catalog in
1993 but scrapped the plan in the face of dealer resistance.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Signs Veterans' Disability Payment Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
on Wednesday signed in observing the Veterans Day a legislation to
increase veterans' disability payments, extending priority health
care to Gulf War veterans and creating a system for averting
future combat-related health catastrophes.
</P>
<P>
The Veterans Programs Enhancement Act gives disabled veterans
or their survivors a 1.3 percent increase in compensation
payments. It also extends priority health care services to Gulf
War veterans through the end of 2001.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the legislation increases the special pension paid
to Medal of Honor to his secretaries of defense, veterans affairs
and health and human services.
</P>
<P>
Clinton ordered his Cabinet to create a military and veterans
health coordinating board.
</P>
<P>
The board would improve "health preparedness" by compiling data
on health risks and medical research associated with deployment;
distributing information on health risks; and improving health
record-keeping by the military, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Before attending an Arlington National Ceremony to mark the
traditional Veterans Day, Clinton released 1.1 billion U.S.
dollars appropriated by Congress for the enhancement of military
readiness. The funds will be used to beef up recruitment, cut the
backlog of equipment awaiting maintenance recipients; expands
eligibility and on-the-job-training options; and expands an
individual's right to return to a job after military service.
</P>
<P>
"Our experience with the Gulf War demonstrated that we were not
adequately prepared to deal with the health consequences resulting
from a large-scale combat deployment in the unique environment our
soldiers faced," Clinton wrote in a memo to his secretaries of
defense, veterans affairs and health and human services.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Ratifies Wye Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Israeli cabinet ratified the
Wye peace accord with the Palestinians Wednesday evening after
about seven hours of debate.
</P>
<P>
The accord, known as the Wye River Memorandum, passed through
the cabinet with eight ministers for, four against and five
abstentions.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a press conference
after the cabinet meeting that the cabinet has decided to accept
the Wye peace accord during Wednesday's meeting, but it also laid
down conditions for implementing the accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel will carry out the second stage troop redeployment
under the Wye accord, but the cabinet decided that the third stage
troop redeployment will be no more than 1 percent of the West
Bank, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We also require the Palestinian side to comply with its
commitment in fighting terror and re-convene the Palestinian
National Council to vote and delete the anti-Israel clauses in
the Palestinian charter," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Israel will implement the Wye peace accord
based on the progress that has been made by the Palestinian side
in implementing it.
</P>
<P>
He expressed strong opposition to Palestinian's plan of
declaring a Palestinian state next May. If the Palestinians do so,
Israel will take counter steps "to protect Israel's security," he
said.
</P>
<P>
To implement the Wye peace accord, Israel will hold immediate
discussions with the Palestinian side on such issues as the Gaza
airport and the release of Palestinians from Israeli jails, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The accord called on Israel to withdraw from a further 13
percent of the West Bank by the end of January in exchange for
Palestinian National Authority's intensified crackdown on Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
However, the troop redeployment may delay for at least a week
as the accord has to be approved by Israeli parliament, and Israel
can not honor its commitment of a 2 percent pull-out by Monday, an
aid to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the press after the
cabinet meeting.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu had over the past two weeks postponed, on different
pretexts, four times the cabinet debate to ratify the accord
signed in Washington on October 23.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's cabinet meeting was held after the Israeli
government had received new assurances from the United States
that the Palestinians side has submited to it a clear plan for
fighting terror.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet, which started the deliberations on the Wye peace
accord last Thursday, halted discussions last Friday after a bomb
attack in Jerusalem. It had said the ministers would not reconvene
until they were satisfied that the Palestinians would wage an
all-out war on anti-Israel militants.
</P>
<P>
Opposing the accord, extremists from both sides have launched
campaigns against their respective governments, calling their
leaders traitors while staging fierce demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
Friday's car bombing by militant Islamic Jihad near Jerusalem's
Mahane Yehuda market killed the two assailants and wounded 21
shoppers, brought the opposition campaign to a climax.

BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein on Wednesday evening called in senior military officers
to discuss the United States military threats against Iraq, the
Iraqi News Agency INA reported.
</P>
<P>
INA said Saddam called in commanders of Air Force and Air
Defense, defense minister, his younger son Kussei Saddam who is
in charge of the Republic Special Guards and other senior
military officers to discuss the preparations for possible
U.S. military strikes against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Iraqi cabinet convened an emergency session also
on Wednesday evening to discuss the possibility of U.S. strikes.

Iraq on October 31 decided to halt cooperation with United
Nations arm inspectors until the U.N. Security Council considers
lifting the economic sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Under the Security Council resolutions, the sanctions can not
be lifted until arms inspectors certify that Iraq has eliminated
all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council on November 5 condemned the Iraqi decision
and urged it to resume cooperation with weapons inspectors, but
Iraq refuses to back down.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday
called for more aid for those developing countries which have
admitted and settled refugees, noting that developing countries
have taken in most of the world's refugees.
</P>
<P>
Some of these countries have assumed the heavy burden of
millions of refugees for decades, worsening their already
vulnerable political, economic, social and environmental
conditions, China's representative told the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
China sees those developing countries which admit large numbers
of refugees as donor countries too, as they contribute greatly to
the resolution of the refugee question, the representative Ren
Yisheng said when he spoke on the item of refugees.
</P>
<P>
China urges the international community especially developed
countries to provide more assistance to countries admitting and
settling refugees as "it is unrealistic and unfair to ask them to
bear the burden of large numbers of refugees all by themselves",
he said.
</P>
<P>
Attributed the flow of refugees to foreign aggression and
occupation, armed conflict, racism, abject poverty and
underdevelopment, he called for respect for state sovereignty
and territorial integrity, non-interference in internal affairs,
peaceful settlement of disputes.

<HEADLINE> Relief Work to Slow down in Iraqi Crisis: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The withdrawal of a number of
U.N. relief workers from Iraq will inevitably slow down the
implementation of humanitarian program in the country, a
U.N. humanitarian official warned Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Hans von Sponeck, the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq,
said at a press conference Wednesday evening that the capacity of
the program has been much reduced.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a quite slowdown in the delivery of food and
medicine" after 130 U.N. humanitarian staff members left Iraq
Wednesday afternoon, Sponeck said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. pulled out some 400 non-essential personnel Wednesday,
including 90 U.N. inspectors, amid signs that the U.S. is
preparing a military strike against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"There is a very definite distinction between the UNSCOM
(United Nations Special Commission) mandate and the mandate for
which I am responsible for the (U.N.) Secretary-General as a
humanitarian program," Sponech said.
</P>
<P>
"How can we just drop it (the humanitarian program) - We owe it
to the Iraqi people. We will stay here," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sponeck, who met with Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed
al-Sahhaf Wednesday morning, said he had every feeling that
U.N. humanitarian staff were welcome in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Tensions between Iraq and the U.N. has heightened since Baghdad
announced to halt all cooperation with UNSCOM, which oversees
Iraq's disarmament, on October 31.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's decision came a day after the Security Council failed to
concede to Baghdad's demand that a U.N. comprehensive review on
Iraq's progress on eradicating all banned weapons leads to the
lifting of the sanctions on it.
</P>
<P>
The council maintains that the sanctions imposed on Iraq
following its invasion of Kuwait, which sparked the 1991 Gulf War,
will not be lifted until U.N. inspectors certify that it has
eliminated all its weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are 200 U.N. relief workers working in
northern Iraq's three Kurdish autonomous governorates and their
work will not be affected by the current situation.
</P>
<P>
With 40 more relief workers leaving Baghdad Thursday morning,
virtually 30 U.N. humanitarian staff members will remain in the
capital to supervise the delivery of food and medicine in Baghdad
and southern Iraq, Sponeck said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Staff Pull out of Iraq on U.S. "Strong  Recommendation" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chief U.N. arms
inspector Richard Butler said on Wednesday he decided on Tuesday
night to pull his weapons staff out of Iraq as a result of the
"strong recommendation" from the U.S. Government and "the concerns
for safety of our personnel in Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Butler, chairman of the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM), told
a press conference here that "the strong recommendation given to
me in the first instance was that of the government of the United
States."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Butler said he made the decision also for safety
reasons. "I was obliged to act quickly," and "in my view, it was
best there be no delay."
</P>
<P>
"The atmosphere in which our people have been working in recent
weeks has been declining," he said, referring to what he said was
"the increasing hostility" towards his staff in Iraq. "That kind
of atmosphere was hardly conducive to safety and security of our
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal decision is "a precautionary measure only," "and
I would make a serious mistake if I did not act in the interest of
the safety of our people by moving them out of Baghdad," he said.
</P>
<P>
Butler is scheduled to explain to the U.N. Security Council,
which called an emergency meeting on Iraq, the reasons for his
withdrawal decision at 3:30 p.m. (EST) on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council decided to convene an unscheduled
closed-door consultations on the Iraqi crisis at the request of
Russia, who wants to find out why Butler made such a decision.
</P>
<P>
"I express regret that I wasn't able to consult more widely
than the persons with whom I consulted last night," including the
president of the Security Council, Peter Burleigh who is also
charge d'affaires of the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, and
officials representing U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who is
currently on an official visit to North Africa.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi crisis has prompted Annan to cut short his North
Africa tour to return to the U.N. headquarters in New York on
Thursday to monitor the council consultations, U.N. spokesman Fred
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
Annan defused the last major Iraqi crisis by reaching an
agreement with the Iraqi Government in February this year to
ensure the unfettered access for the UNSCOM personnel to all
sites.
</P>
<P>
On August 5, Iraq announced the suspension of cooperation with
the UNSCOM after its failure to press for the restruction of the
U.N. team to reduce what it said the U.S. influence. On October
31, Iraq, without seeing any hope of lifting the sanctions in
force following its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
A prime condition for any lifting of sanctions is a report to
the Security Council by the U.N. weapons inspectors that all
Iraq's nuclear, chemical, biological and ballistic missile systems
have been accounted for and destroyed.
</P>
<P>
Iraq charges that UNSCOM is prolonging the disarmament process,
at Washington's behest, so that sanctions will remain in force
indefinitely. Besides, Baghdad also accused some UNSCOM personnel
of engaging espionage for the United States and Israel.

<HEADLINE> Cohen Orders Military Buildup in Gulf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen Wednesday ordered a major buildup of U.S. military
force in the Gulf following President Bill Clinton's warnings of
military strike on Iraq if it does not comply.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said giving in to Iraq on weapons inspections would
undermine U.N. credibility and embolden Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein to "act recklessly" against his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to hope -- indeed, pray -- that Saddam will
comply" with U.N. inspections, Clinton said. "But we must be
prepared to act if he does not."
</P>
<P>
Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman, said Cohen's deployment
order would result in a "substantial increase" in U.S. strength in
the region, sending an additional 129 combat and support aircraft.
</P>
<P>
That would bring the total to about 300 U.S. military aircraft
compared with 430 during last March's buildup during a similar
crisis with Iraq, Col. Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman,
said.
</P>
<P>
Among fresh warplanes going to the region include several dozen
F-15 and F-16 jet fighters, 12 FA-18s, 12 F-117 stealth fighters,
six B-1 bombers and 12 B-52 bombers, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84 combat aircraft and 45 support aircraft will join
173 warplanes already in the region.
</P>
<P>
Another 3,000 U.S. combat troops will join 1,500 already
stationed in Kuwait to help protect its borders, Bridges said. A
light infantry unit of at least 500 troops will go to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more Patriot missile defense units will be
deployed in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These actions are being taken as a prudent measure to enhance
our capability in the region and to provide additional military
options should the use of force become necessary," Bridges said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton: U.S. Ready to Act if Iraq Does not Comply </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said on Wednesday that the U.S. is prepared to act if the Iraqi
government does not resume cooperation with the U.N. weapons
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Clinton issued the serious warning at a Veterans Day ceremony
at the Arlington Cemetery in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
The best way for the Iraqi government to have the sanctions
against Iraq lifted is to comply and cooperate with the U.N.
inspectors, Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
Clinton made no mention of a deadline for Iraq to comply with
U.N. demands, but he made clear that a U.S. military attack was
possible.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to hope _ indeed, pray _ that Saddam will comply,"
Clinton said. "But we must be prepared to act if he does not."
</P>
<P>
In his most extensive remarks on the Iraqi problem since Saddam
cut off cooperation with the U.N. inspectors, Clinton said
preserving the inspection system was the best way to assure the
world _ and especially Iraq's neighbors _ that Saddam was not
rebuilding an arsenal of banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that an inspection system without Iraqi
cooperation was useless.
</P>
<P>
"If the inspectors are not permitted to visit suspect sites or
monitor compliance at known production facilities, they may as
well be in Baltimore, not Baghdad," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
The president's remarks suggested he sees a grave danger in
allowing Saddam to get away with continued defiance.
</P>
<P>
"That would open a window of opportunity for Iraq to rebuild
its arsenal of weapons and delivery systems in months _ I say
again, in months _ not years," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Failure to respond, to embolden Saddam to act recklessly...
would permanently damage the credibility of the U.N. Security
Council to act as a force for promoting international peace and
security," he added.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, meanwhile, decided to
delay her departure for Asia by one day. She had been scheduled to
leave Thursday for a meeting of Asian-Pacific nations in Malaysia,
in advance of Clinton's scheduled arrival next week.
</P>
<P>
One military option is a short-notice attack that would not
require a big new U.S. buildup in the Gulf, U.S. officials say.
Hundreds of cruise missiles already are in the region for just
such a strike.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, November 11 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said here Wednesday that Bonn sees Russia as a key pillar
in European peace and an indispensable partner in facing global
crisis and challenges.
</P>
<P>
Fisher, who is also German vice-chancellor, is on a five-hour
trip here to prepare for the upcoming visit by Germany's new
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to Moscow, scheduled for November 16
and 17.
</P>
<P>
Fisher told his Russian counterpart, Igor Ivanov, that there
will be no fundamental change to its Russia policy, in spite of
some adjustments, Itar-Tass reported.
</P>
<P>
Two major tasks in German foreign policy are helping Russia's
integration into international cooperation and supporting Russia's
democratization and market reforms unconditionally, Fisher said.
</P>
<P>
He also met with Russian Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov, who
said Moscow attaches great importance to its ties with Bonn and
that such ties can play a significant role in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik, Finance Minister
Mikhail Zadornov and Central Bank chairman Viktor Gerashchenko
also took part in Primakov's meeting with Fisher.
</P>
<P>
"I invited them with a purpose," Tass quoted Primakov as
telling Fisher. "I was told that you are interested in the current
situation in Russia. So I think it will be useful for you to talk
with my colleagues."

<HEADLINE> U.S. Orders Major Military Buildup Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States ordered
129 warplanes and more than 3,000 troops to the Gulf on Wednesday
and U.S. President Bill Clinton said he was prepared to act with
force if the Iraqi government does not comply.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen signed the order to send the
additional forces.
</P>
<P>
That would bring the total to about 300 U.S. military aircraft
compared with 430 during last February's buildup during a similar
crisis with Iraq, said Richard Bridges, a Pentagon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Among fresh warplanes going to the region include several dozen
F-15 and F-16 jet fighters, 12 FA-18s, 12 F-117 stealth fighters,
six B-1 bombers and 12 B-52 bombers, Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 84 combat aircraft and 45 support aircraft will join
173 warplanes already in the region.
</P>
<P>
Another 3,000 U.S. combat troops will join 1,500 already
stationed in Kuwait to help protect its borders, Bridges said. A
light infantry unit of at least 500 troops will go to the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
In addition, more Patriot missile defense units will be
deployed in the region, he said.
</P>
<P>
"These actions are being taken as a prudent measure to enhance
our capability in the region and to provide additional military
options should the use of force become necessary," Bridges said.
</P>
<P>
"We expect that the first units will be leaving in the next few
days... It means that the president has more options at his
disposal. It gives him more flexibility" in any military attack
ordered against Iraq, said Pentagon spokesman Kenneth Bacon.
</P>
<P>
Bacon spoke with reporters after Clinton said in a Veterans Day
speech at Arlington National Cemetery that Iraq's President Saddam
Hussein must comply with U.N. weapons inspections and not be
allowed to build nuclear, chemical and biological arms.
</P>
<P>
The standoff began October 31 when Baghdad abruptly announced it
would no longer cooperate with U.N. weapons inspections, as
required under terms of the peace accords that ended the 1991 Gulf
War.
</P>
<P>
"From my perspective, I would say that Saddam Hussein has been
given adequate warning...We have seen very strong resolve on the
part of the United Nations," said Army Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
"They are telling him that he needs to honor his commitments
and I think that alone should serve as enough warning," Shelton
said on Wednesday in separate appearances on several television
networks.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Cohen stressed that time was running out for Iraq.
He ordered the carrier Enterprise, which left Norfolk, Virginia,
this week to replace the Eisenhower in the Gulf, to speed its
passage and arrive on November 23 instead of November 26.
</P>
<P>
The United States also authorized the departure of all
non-essential personnel from its embassies in Kuwait and Israel.

<HEADLINE> European Stock Markets Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- A strong U.S. dollar and
soaring equity markets in Asia prompted a rebound in European
stocks Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the positive activities, the FTSE 100 managed to
shrug off lackluster sessions this week for a positive finish.
</P>
<P>
The blue-chip FTSE 100 index closed up 44 points at 5,477.
"There's a pile of cash sitting waiting to go into the market and
three FTSE companies coming out with better-than-expected figures
has triggered this rise," said a senior equity salesman in the
City.
</P>
<P>
London's leading index moved ahead from the start, posting
solid opening gains in sympathy with soaring Asian markets --
Singapore's leading share index rocketed 5.5 percent, Hong Kong's
4.3 percent and Tokyo's 2.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The strong rebound was then compounded by hopeful signs in
Wednesday morning's release of the latest Bank of England
inflation quarterly.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said the bank's view that the economy would stay out of
recession despite dropping back to 1 percent next year before
picking back up in 2000 was encouraging for corporate earnings.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt, German shares finished mostly higher, as Wall
Street's rise and a round of good corporate news gave investors
grounds for extending Wednesday's expected technical recovery.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xextra Dax index gained on the back of earnings
announcements ending 0.5 percent higher. Schering rose 3 percent
after the drugs group reported a 7 percent rise in nine-month net
profit.
</P>
<P>
The Paris and Belgian bourses were closed for Armistice Day
holidays and the U.S. bond market was shut for Veterans Day.

UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- China on Wednesday
called for accession by more countries to the Convention of
Refugees and its Protocol.
</P>
<P>
"As a signatory to the Convention and its Protocol, China would
like to urge more countries to accede to them," China's
representative Ren Yisheng told the third committee (social,
humanitarian and cultural) of the U.N. General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He appealed to the countries concerned to adopt measures to
safeguard the basic human rights of asylum seekers as some western
countries persisted in their restrictive asylum policy,
indiscriminately turning away large numbers of asylum seekers.
</P>
<P>
Ren said China admitted and resettled close to 300,000
Indo-Chinese refugees despite of economic difficulties, and it
will continue to make its contribution to the solution of the
global problem of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Optimistic About EU Accession Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides said Wednesday he was optimistic that Cyprus'
course of accession to the European Union (EU) will be concluded
successfully.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his return from Brussels, where he attended the
opening of substantive EU accession talks, Kasoulides quoted his
Austrian counterpart Wolfgang Schuessel as saying that "nothing
can stop Cyprus' accession course."
</P>
<P>
Austria is now holding the rotating presidency of the EU.
</P>
<P>
However, Kasoulides said the Cypriot government has been aware
of the difficulties posed by the division of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided into Turkish Cypriot-controlled
north and Greek Cypriot-dominated south since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has so far maintained 35,000 troops in northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Some EU member states have associated Cyprus' EU accession
course with country's reunification problem, saying that the
problem should be solved before the island joins the EU.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island
through bi-communal formula, but the Turkish Cypriots opted out of
the peace negotiations last year to protest the EU's decision to
begin accession talks with Cyprus while scraping Turkey off its
immediate membership candidates list.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides pointed out that "the EU should turn to Turkey,
which is the cause of the problem, and demand that it comply with
U.N. resolutions."
</P>
<P>
The EU should also make it clear that Turkey has no right to
veto Cyprus' accession to the EU, he said.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on a European Commission report, which calls for
holding up the deployment of Russian-made missiles on the island,
Kasoulides said that the National Council, the top advisory body
to Cypriot president on the Cyprus problem, has made the decision
over the issue, which still stands for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus ordered the S-300 surface-to-air missiles from Russia
in January 1997 to bolster the its air defense against Turkey. And
the missiles are expected to be delivered to Cyprus at the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The U.S., Britain and some other countries have voiced their
objections to the planned deployment of the missiles while Turkey
has threatened to launch preemptive strikes if they are deployed
on the island.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said any decision on the matter should be taken by
the National Council and the government has no intents now to make
any new proposals.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cypriot government's position is that the
missiles will not be deployed if there is substantive progress
toward a Cyprus settlement or demilitarization of the island.
</P>
<P>
"There have been no developments which could lead the
government toward this direction," Kasoulides said.

<P>
MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Russia said Thursday that it is
attempting to prevent the use of force in Iraq amid growing
tension in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Foreign Ministry said its representatives to the
United Nations "sharply raised the question of the nature of the
threats that caused the leaders of U.N. Special Commission and the
Secretariat to evacuate the personnel of all international
organizations and humanitarian programs from Iraq."
</P>
<P>
Russia "spoke about the serious negative impact of these
decisions -- which were made without mandatory consultations with
the Security Council -- on the prospects of long-term monitoring
of military programs in Iraq, and on the implementation of the
oil-for-food humanitarian program," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The concern expressed by the Russian delegation was shared by
representatives of China, France, Brazil and other countries,"
Interfax reported, quoting a press release issued by the ministry.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. Security Council alone has the right to make
decisions on steps to be taken while maintaining international
peace and security," the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the Security Council members backed the statement
by U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who urged Baghdad to resume
cooperation with the U.N. and confirmed the idea of comprehensive
review of the disarmament files.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate goal of his statement is to lift sanctions against
Iraq, the ministry said.

MOSCOW, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Russian official said
Thursday that "certain progress" was reached at the talks between
Russian President Boris Yeltsin and visiting Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi at the Kremlin.

Sergei Prikhodko, deputy head of the Russian Presidential

</P>
<P>
The present relations between Russia and Japan are marked by

countries have managed to go beyond that and think about the
future.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the disputed four North Pacific islands.
The islands, known in Japan as the Northern Territories and in
Russia as the Southern Kurils, have long been a sticking point
barring the signing of a formal peace treaty between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Gone is the time when we were using each other's difficulties
and problems," Prikhodko said. "We have come to take each other
more seriously. Moscow is very serious about the role of Japan in
the emerging polycentric world. Tokyo is equally serious about the
role of Russia despite the difficulties the latter is going
through."
</P>
<P>
He said Yeltsin passed the Japanese prime minister his
proposals on a solution to the territorial dispute between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
"Russia is not going to publicize these proposals primarily
because we would not like to assert our position via the media or
inflict any political damage on ourselves or our partner,"
Prikhodko said.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi promised that Japan will study Russia's proposals as
attentively as Russia had studied those of the Japanese, Prikhodko
said.
</P>
<P>
Although the contents of the Russian proposal were kept secret,
Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov said the Russian proposals
amount to "the formation of such conditions, which without
damaging the state interests and political approaches of the
sides, promote the development of a favorable atmosphere for joint
economic and other activities on the Kuril islands."
</P>
<P>
Besides the territorial problem, the two leaders also discussed
a wide range of other international and bilateral issues.
</P>
<P>
They praised the implementation of the plan for cooperation
between the two countries approved by Yeltsin and former Japanese
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto at their informal talks in
Krasnoyarsk, Siberia, last November.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin and Obuchi acknowledged the progress achieved in such
spheres as investment, Russia's integration into the international
economy, support for Russian reform, the preparation of Russian
personnel, cooperation in the energy sector, the peaceful use of
nuclear energy and joint space exploration projects.
</P>
<P>
Japan decided earlier this month to disburse 800 million U.S.
dollars in the framework of the untied 1.5 billion dollar loan of
the Export-Import Bank to boost reforms in Russia, Interfax
reported.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi announced on Thursday that Tokyo would give Russia 10
million dollars worth of medicines and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Obuchi is here on a three-day official visit, the first one by
a Japanese premier in 25 years. He will also meet with Russian
Minister Yevgeny Primakov on Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Stephen Ip, secretary for
Economic Services, Thursday described the visit to Beijing by the
Hong Kong Port and Maritime Board members as "most useful."
</P>
<P>
He made these remarks when he returned to Hong Kong Thursday at
the end of the delegation's three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
Ip said the visit helps strengthen communication between Hong
Kong and the mainland's port authorities and shipping industries
and lay a good foundation for future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
During the visit, he said the board members had very
constructive discussions with Minister of Communications Huang
Zhendong, director of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office Liao
Hui and Chairman of China Ocean Shipping (Group) Company Chen
Zhongbiao.
</P>
<P>
"We briefed them on the measures taken by the government of the
 Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) to promote Hong
Kong as an international shipping center, including the
establishment of the Hong Kong Port and Maritime board," he said.
</P>
<P>
The mainland officials agreed that Hong Kong had excellent port
and shipping facilities. They expressed support for the work done
by the Hong Kong Port and Maritime Board in promoting its shipping
industry and undertook to do their best under the "one country,
two systems" principle to assist Hong Kong in developing into an
international maritime center.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also touched on matters related to the
feasibility of lowering fees and charges paid by Hong Kong ships
when calling mainland ports and the arrangements for Hong Kong
ships to employ mainland sailors and their training.
</P>
<P>
Ip concluded: "We hope that the two sides will keep up the
contact and join hands in promoting Hong Kong as an international
shipping center."

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Hopes APEC Will Focus on Economic Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Thursday expressed the hope that the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) meetings would focus on the present
economic problems of East Asia and the world.
</P>
<P>
APEC senior officials began their meeting here Thursday, which
will be followed by the ministerial meeting on November 14-15 and
the informal meeting of APEC leaders on November 17-18.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that APEC would be able to decide on "what needs to
be done with regards to currency trading," Mahathir said at a
press conference after the launch of two new Proton variants of
Proton Perdana and Proton Satria here.
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia would consider lifting its selective
currency control measures when the international community decides
"to do something to the world's financial regime and regulate
currency trading."
</P>
<P>
"We have to see what (financial) regime they have
internationally before we can lift our controls," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked how the controls had fared so far, Mahathir said "nothing
has collapsed and it has not hurt us that much."
</P>
<P>
Malaysia instead is still doing well in terms of trade with
huge surpluses, bigger reserves and better sales of houses and
vehicles, he said.

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day conference of the global Indian
entrepreneurs, Vajpayee said his government would formulate a dual

</P>
<P>
The PIC card would provide holders parity with non-resident
Indians for all facilities, Vajpayee told the meeting organized by
the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry
(FICCI).
</P>
<P>
The Indian leader said that his government would set up a
suitable mechanism for effective and continuos consultation with
non-resident Indians and also strengthen investment centers in the
country to address the investment concerns of the overseas
Indians.
</P>
<P>
Indians abroad reportedly remitted over 24 billion U.S. dollars
in the last two years.

aberration on dividend received by non-resident Indians on
non-repatriable investments if they were forthcoming with more
information in this regard, Vajpayee said.

<HEADLINE> China's Oldest, Largest Sugar Mill Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Intermediate People's Court
of Harbin, the capital of northeast China's Heilongjiang Province,
today announced the bankruptcy of the Heilongjiang Province Echeng
Sugar Mill, the oldest and largest of its kind in China,
</P>
<P>
The court made it clear that the plan for the distribution of
the mill's properties, put forward by its creditors, is accepted
under law and will be carried out.
</P>
<P>
The sugar maker, with a staff of 4,490, was set up in 1905 and
has the capacity to process over 3,000 tons of beets a day. The
mill had handed over a total of 300 million yuan in pre-tax
profits to the government.
</P>
<P>
The mill has been in trouble since 1993, and now owes
accumulated debts of 700 million yuan, including interest, to
local banks, mostly to the Harbin Branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
</P>
<P>
Heilongjiang has an annual sugar production capacity of over
seven million tons, but the local beet output stands at only three
million tons.
</P>
<P>
As the Harbin Branch of the ICBC has agreed to write off the
debt, many local investors are now interested in purchasing the
mill, which still has a sound infrastructure.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Nepali Prime Minister Girija
Prasad Koirala stressed Thursday in Pokhara, about 200 kilometers
west of Kathmandu, that Nepal should not misuse foreign
assistance.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks when formally opening the Seti River Bridge
constructed under the grant assistance of the Chinese government.
</P>
<P>
He said that foreign loans and grant assistance are the
taxpayers' money and Nepal should make good use of it.
</P>
<P>
Donors including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank
had complained about inappropriate use of their assistance by the
Nepali government.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his appreciation over China's
cooperation in the development efforts of Nepal, especially in the
areas of road, hydropower, water resources and industry.
</P>
<P>
With the completion of the 196-meter-long and 9.5-metre-wide
Seti River Bridge, China has helped Nepal complete 25 projects
including roads, irrigation facilities, hydropower plant, leather
factory, paper mill and conference hall.
</P>
<P>
The construction of the Seti River Bridge, with a total
investment cost of 4.9 million U.S. dollars, began in December
1996 and completed in August this year. It was handed over in
advance to the Nepalese side on September 20 to meet the heavy
traffic during the Dashain Festival.

Addressing the inaugural ceremony, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal
Zeng Xuyong said that as friendly neighbors linked by mountains
and rivers, China and Nepal have always enjoyed fruitful
cooperation in various fields including economic and cultural
fields.

Bridge will surely play a positive role in Nepal's economic and
social progress," he said.

<HEADLINE> Mongolian Currency Devalued Against US Dollar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's currency, the
tughrik, was quoted at 900 to 1 against the U. S. Dollar here on
Thursday, from 885-1 one day before on concerns over the
worsening financial situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
The value of the tughrik has fallen almost 10 percent since the
closing of last year at 813-1 against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Some traders blame the devaluation on the escalating financial
difficulties and decreasing foreign reserves of the country.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that a financial deficit as high as 50.2
billion tughriks (55.8 million U.S. dollars) and a foreign trade
deficit of 119 million U.S. dollars were reported in the first
nine months this year. In particular, export volume dropped 26.7
percent compared with the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Foreign reserves, meanwhile, also declined to a low of 73
million U.S. dollars, according to Jigjidiyn Onenbat, president of
Mongolbank, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The recent suspension of 45 million dollars promised by some
international financial institutions contributed even more to the

<HEADLINE> 64 Kurdish Rebels Killed in Cross-Border Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A total of 64 rebels of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK) have been killed in the
continuing cross-border military operation in northern Iraq
staged by the Turkish security forces.
</P>
<P>
The semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported Thursday that
backed by military fighters and helicopters, some 20,000 Turkish
government troops have destroyed many PKK camps and shelters in
northern Iraq and captured a lot of weapons and ammunition in the
cross-border operation which started on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish troops attacked the PKK rebels in the Hakurk
region along the northern Iraqi-Iranian border, towards which
hundreds of PKK rebels are fleeing.
</P>
<P>
The PKK members who escaped from neighboring Syria were trying
to force their way into Iran to take shelter from the Turkish
attack as they are not allowed to shelter themselves in Syria.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued by the office of the Emergency
Regional Rule on Thursday, the Turkish security forces also killed
21 PKK militants in the southeastern provinces of Diyarbakir and
Bingol within 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both Iraq's Kurdish Democratic Party (KDP) leader
Massoud Barzani and Patriotic Union of Kurdistan Chairman Jalal
Talabani have promised Turkey that they will join hands to fight
the PKK and maintain peace and stability in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Most of the PKK guerrillas have taken shelter in northern
Iraq, which became a power vacuum after Baghdad lost control over
it following the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Fire Kills One, Destroys Over 200 Shops in Seoul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 12 (Xinhua) -- One person was killed and three
firefighters injured by a fire early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
The fire broke out at Kwangjang Market, which consists of six
buildings in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Property damage in the market was estimated at billions of
South Korean won, said police Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
It took 400 firefighters and 76 fire trucks more than six hours
to bring the fire under control due to the complex structure of
the market buildings, the intensity of the fire, and narrow roads
leading to and through the market.
</P>
<P>
The fire was spotted at around 1:55 a.m. by a market security
guard who happened to see flames in a textile shop on the first
floor of a market building.
</P>
<P>
Toxic gas from textile chemicals spred several hundred meters
from the market, forcing nearby residents to evacuate.
</P>
<P>
An investigation into the fire's cause is under way, said the police.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the Seoul Anti-Fire Headquarters said as
many as 6,307 fires have erupted in the first 10 months of this
year, a rise of 12.8 percent over the 5,592 registered during the
same period last year.

<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior Communist Party of
China (CPC) official has urged the country's inspection and
supervision departments to contribute still more to the ongoing
anti-corruption campaign.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, made the remark while meeting
with participants at the recent second congress of the China
Supervision Society.

he said.
</P>
<P>
Wei urged the supervisors and inspectors to study Deng Xiaoping
Theory and instructions from the CPC central leadership with
General Secretary Jiang Zemin at the core.

<HEADLINE> Power Failure Disrupts Train Service in Brussels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Train services were disrupted
Thursday morning in the Belgian capital of Brussels after electric
power went off in stations and along the railways.
</P>
<P>
Commuter trains heading toward the city were idled, while
trains leaving the city had either to delay their departure by 20
to 30 minutes or to stop.
</P>
<P>
The service disruption was caused by a cut-off of electric
power. The railway authorities said the exact cause was still
under investigation.
</P>
<P>
Eyewitnesses, however, said a locomotive damaged electricity
cables running between two Brussels' railway stations located in
the city's southern and northern ends.
</P>
<P>
Railway authorities said train service was expected to return
to normal by the afternoon if the repair work went well.
</P>
<P>
This was the second time within a week that Brussels' commuting
services were temporarily disrupted.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, a strike by bus, tram and subway train drivers
paralyzed the public transport system for almost a day.
</P>
<P>
The strike was called by bus, tram and subway train operators
in the municipality to press their demand for fewer working
hours.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia's CPP, FUNCINPEC Hold Summit Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Leaders of the ruling
Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and opposition FUNCINPEC party held
a summit meeting Thursday evening in the Royal Palace under the
chair of King Norodom Sihanouk, aimed at hammering out a
power-sharing deal.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting are CPP President Chea Sim and Second
Prime Minister Hun Sen, also vice president of CPP, and FUNCINPEC
President Prince Ranariddh, who returned here Thursday afternoon
from Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
The king gave them a warm welcome and thanked them for their
support to his proposal. "It is very good to have a such summit. I
never think of myself or my throne except the interests of the
nation and the people," the monarch said.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh agreed to return and join the summit after he has got
fresh security guarantees from Hun Sen that parliamentary immunity
of opposition MPs would be respected.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, the self-named opposition party leader, is still in
Paris. But he expressed in his fax to Prince Ranariddh his support
to him and wishes he will achieve great success in discussion with
the leaders of the CPP.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, who left the country on
September 25, have been insisting on holding a summit meeting
abroad, claiming they fear about their safety, but Hun Sen, who
argues the political stalemate is a domestic issue, has refused to
meet outside the country.
</P>
<P>
Previously Hun Sen had assured all opposition MPs full security
but said excluding those facing charges in court.
</P>
<P>
Last week the king also offered Prince Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy
full palace protection and accommodation in a bid to entice them
back to join the summit.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have already held one summit and three rounds
of working group meeting but failed to make significant progress
due to the great differences on the power-sharing in the National
Assembly and the government.
</P>
<P>
There is not much time left for the King to chair the talks,
because the King is scheduled to leave Saturday for Beijing to
have a medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
At press time, the talks are still going on in the Royal
Palace. The summit will continue on Friday.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea's Five Largest Chaebols Fined 20.9 Billion Won </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, November 12 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's five largest
family-owned conglomerates, or chaebols, have been fined 20.9
billion won (16 million U.S. dollars, one dollar equivalent to
1,300 won) for illegal internal group deals, the Fair Trade
Commission (FTC) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK were penalized as their 33
strong subsidiary companies engaged in illegal commercial
transactions worth 1.49 trillion won with their 21 weak firms,
mostly financially troubled ones.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Group's 13 subsidiaries were fined 9.1 billion won,
followed by Daewoo's 11 firms with 4.5 billion won, Samsung's two
units with three billion won, LG's three companies with 2.2
billion won and SK's four affiliates for 2.1 billion won.
</P>
<P>
The amount of financial aid given through illegal transactions
was 54.6 billion won, which broke down to 28.8 billion won for
Hyundai, 8.4 billion won for Daewoo, 7.2 billion won for Samsung,
6.5 billion won for LG and 3.7 billion won for SK.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time the top five conglomerates have been
fined for illegal inter-subsidiary transactions.
</P>
<P>
The FTC, an antitrust watchdog, fined them 72.2 billion won in
penalties on similar charges in July this year.
</P>
<P>
The illegal deals included the fact that stronger companies of
the five groups bought commercial papers or bonds issued by weak
subsidiary firms at much higher prices, and healthy companies
delayed receipt of payments from weak affiliates.
</P>
<P>
A new type of illegal deal uncovered in the second
investigation showed that Daewoo Group's nine subsidiaries allowed
Daewoo Securities to play the virtual role in managing corporate
bond issues in the name of other brokerage houses.
</P>
<P>
Investigations of unfair business practices among the country's
five largest chaebols are often seen as the South Korean
government's moves to press them for further corporate
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Foreign analysts blame the rapid collapse of the nation's
corporate sector on the long-standing practice of strong companies
supporting weaker ones.
</P>
<P>
As weak companies sap resources, strong companies face
financial distress as well. A prime example of this type of fiasco
is Samsung Motors Inc.
</P>
<P>
Samsung Electronics and other relatively sound group
subsidiaries have poured more than three trillion won into the
launch of the automotive unit whose future remains in doubt in the
highly competitive automobile market.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the Kim Dae-jung administration may be attempting
to break up conglomerates by uprooting cross-funding among group
subsidiaries.
</P>
<P>
They said some of the recipient companies could be liquidated
eventually under the government's restructuring program.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, ailing companies affiliated with the five
conglomerates were ordered to be liquidated by creditor
banks.

<HEADLINE> EU to Ban More Antibiotics in Animal Feed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said
on Thursday that it has proposed to the council of ministers a ban
on four more antibiotics used in animal feed because of human
health concerns.
</P>
<P>
A commission spokesman told the press that if the council of
European Union agriculture ministers approved the proposal, the
ban would go into effect on January 1 next year.
</P>
<P>
Eight antibiotics that have little pharmaceutical value for
human beings are allowed to be used in the production of animal
feed in the EU.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first such ban in 10 years within the 15-nation
union if EU agriculture ministers give their approval in December.
</P>
<P>
If approved, the spokesman added, the ban would also affect the
imports into the EU of animal feed that uses the banned
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made after the commission's scientific
committee had established a link between the use of the four
antibiotics in animal feed and the resistance in human beings to
a growing reservoir of bacteria due to the transfer of the
antibiotic resistance from animal meat to human beings.
</P>
<P>
The four proposed antibiotics -- bacitracin zinc, spiramycin,
virginiamycin and tylosin phosphate -- tend to be used in feed for
pigs and poultry, the commission spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A total of 1,600 tons of antibiotics are used annually in the
production of animal feed in the EU, accounting for 15 percent of
the total use of antibiotics in the union for both human beings
and animals.
</P>
<P>
The ban on the four antibiotics is expected to affect
manufacturers in France, Belgium, Britain and Norway.

WASHINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major
news items in leading U.S. newspapers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- President Bill Clinton declared Wednesday that the United
States "must be prepared to act" forcefully to end Iraq's defiance
of the United Nations and authorized a new buildup of military
forces in the Persian Gulf, as U.N. officials evacuated most
weapons inspectors and relief personnel from Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
-- Israel's cabinet ratified the U.S.-brokered Middle East
peace plan on Wednesday but added so many conditions to its narrow
approval.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Seeking to capitalize on the public's distaste with the
inquiry against President Bill Clinton, Democrats on the House
Judiciary Committee called on the panel to vote early next week on
whether the allegations are grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>

The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- A nation-wide gun-buyer database is due to go into service

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Initiates Power Generation Projects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladesh Power Development
Board (PDB) has taken up a number of power generation projects in
both the private and public sectors in a bid to meet the ever
growing demand for power in the country, a newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The objective of these projects is to add at least 1,700
megawatts to the national grid by the year 2001, The Financial
Express said.
</P>
<P>
The private sector power generation plants will add 1,100-1,200
megawatts of power to the national grid while the remaining
500-600 megawatts will come from the public sector power plants to
be built by the PDB.
</P>
<P>
There will be at least 500 megawatts of surplus power in 2001
when the country's total power generation reaches 3,700 megawatts
against a demand of 3,200 megawatts, PDB Chairman Nuruddin Mahmud
Kamal was quoted as saying recently.
</P>
<P>
The PDB had earlier signed a number of agreements in this
regard with private power companies, he stated.
</P>
<P>
The 110-megawatt barge-mounted power plant in the southwestern
district of Khulna already started operation in September while
another barge-mounted private sector power plant will be opened by
December this year in the western district of Pabna.
</P>
<P>
Another two private power projects will be launched in the next
six months in the southeastern district of Narayanganj.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Energy and Power has signed an agreement with a
U.S. power company for the installation of a 350-megawatt
land-based power station in Haripur district, 342 kilometers
northwest of here.
</P>
<P>
The government is considering the proposal of another U.S.
company for establishing four power centers with a total capacity
of 350 megawatts in different parts of the country, the PDB chief
said.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to install at least five public sector
power plants with a total capacity of 700 megawatts in various
parts of the country by the year 2001, he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, the installed capacity of power generation in the
country is 3,091 megawatts, but the available power generation
capacity is only 1900-2000 megawatts and the peak hour requirement
is 2300 megawatts. Therefore, the government is attaching great
importance to developing the power generation sector.
</P>
<P>
During the current fiscal year (July 1998-June 1999), the
government will spend 12.5 billion taka (about 258 million U.S.
dollars), or over 10 percent of the Annual Development Plan's
budget, on the power generation sector, according to the Finance
Minister's budget report.

<HEADLINE> Logging Ban Has Limited Impact on Timber Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China does not expect to
increase timber imports as a result of the recent ban on logging,
according to State Foresty Administration Director Wang Zhibao.
</P>
<P>
"China's will find domestic solutions to overcome timber
shortages resulting from the ban," said Wang. "We need not
increase timber imports."
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that ban on logging operations in natural forests in
the middle and upper reaches of the Yangtze and Yellow rivers will
create a 10 million cu.m. shortage of timber. China will solve
related problems by improving forest management and increasing
logging activities in designated areas.
</P>
<P>
China's 62 million ha. of young forests will mature rapidly,
according to Wang.
</P>
<P>
The country will also increase logging efforts on 33 million
ha. of afforested areas which are approaching the prime harvest
period.
</P>
<P>
Wang admitted that China will still import certain amounts of
timber to improve the structure of the logging industry and expand
timber varieties.

<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A variety of activities were

Dr.Sun Yat-sen, a forerunner of the Chinese revolution.
</P>
<P>
In Beijing, the National Committee of the Chinese People's

<HEADLINE> Philippines Committed to APEC's Sectoral Liberalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines said Thursday
that it is committed to economic liberalization endorsed by the
previous Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) meeting.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokesman Jerry Barican told a press briefing that
the Philippines would work with other APEC members in ensuring a
"mutually beneficial and balanced outcome" of the Early Voluntary
Sectoral Liberalization (EVSL).
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the APEC leaders endorsed 15 sectors for EVSL with the
view to having liberalization measures hastened in nine of the 15
sectors next year.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines would implement the liberalization of nine
sectors under EVSL starting next year, Barican said
</P>
<P>
"A major element of the collective effort in restoring
financial stability in the region is APEC's unwavering commitment
to open markets and investment regimes," Barican said.
</P>
<P>
Barican also said Philippine President Joseph Estrada is
expected to state his commitment to regional economic and
technical cooperation when he attends the APEC meeting next week.

<HEADLINE> German Traders Urge EU, US to Make Peace in Banana Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Germany's foreign traders and the
wholesalers' federation BGA Thursday urged the European Union and
the United States to find a peaceful solution to the escalating
dispute over banana market regulations.
</P>
<P>
"The saber-rattling is making a solution to the trade dispute
increasingly difficult," BGA president Michael Fuchs said in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
Fuchs called a U.S. announcement of duties to be imposed on a
list of European goods as an aggressive step.
</P>
<P>
But he said the root of the problem was the EU's "protectionist
market" regulations. Since 1993 Europe has favored African and
Caribbean banana exporters to the detriment of Central American
banana producers.
</P>
<P>
Fuchs accused the E.U. Commission of permitting the dispute to
escalate, and he said that from a German point of view, the EU
regulations put the Central American producers at a disadvantage.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came two days after Washington published a
five-page list of European exports which could be the subject of
unilateral U.S. sanctions. The action is meant to signal
Washington's anger at Brussels' failure to change its banana
import regime.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said a World Trade Organization panel ruled last
year that the EU must modify its special preferential import
system for African, Caribbean and Pacific exporters because it
discriminated against Central American banana producers.
</P>
<P>
The EU earlier this year changed some aspects of its regime
but the U.S. has described the changes as unsatisfactory.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, European Commission President Jacques Santer
Wednesday urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to give "urgent
personal attention" to the increasingly fierce transatlantic
dispute over Europe's banana imports.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Santer said the E.U. chief had warned Clinton
that Washington's threatened unilateral sanctions on European
exports could damage global trade relations.
</P>
<P>
Santer said that if the U.S. persisted in its action, the EU
would take legal action against Washington in the Geneva-based
WTO.

<P>
FUZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- People's political consultative
conferences at all levels should play their due role in building
socialist democracy and contributing to the implementation of the
general tasks of the Communist Party of China (CPC).
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, made this
remark during an inspection tour of east China's Fujian Province
from November 8-11.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC leader said it is the Communist Party which created
the political consultative body and defined its nature, tasks and
manner of work. The consultative bodies at all levels should work
actively and try their best to fulfill their job, but should not
exceed their scope of responsibility and cause trouble, he noted.
</P>
<P>
During his trip, Li visited local factories and development
zones and urged local government officials to map out long-term
programs for the development of cities as part of the effort to
enhance the living standards of the local people.
</P>
<P>
Greater importance should also be attached to agriculture and
rural reform as the vast majority of the Chinese people live in
the countryside, and the development of rural areas have a great
impact on the development of the whole country, Li said.

<HEADLINE> UAE Press Opposes Use of Force Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Newspapers in the United
Arab Emirates (UAE) have unanimously expressed opposition to the
use of force against Iraq, calling for a diplomatic resolution of
the current crisis between Iraq and the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Al Itihad newspaper on Thursday stressed in an editorial that
Washington's possible attack against Iraq would undermine
U.S.-Arab relations.
</P>
<P>
The overall developments suggest that the U.S. is heading
towards a new aggression against Iraq to wipe it out from the map
altogether, rather than reaffirming and asserting the prestige of
the international community, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The Al Khalij newspaper underscored in its editorial that
launching a strike at Iraq is totally unjustifiable. It said
the current crisis over weapons inspections in Iraq is open to
diplomatic solution should the U.S. entertain the least of good
intentions.
</P>
<P>
The Al Bayan newspaper underlined in its editorial the
negative Arab reactions to the use of military force against Iraq,
saying that U.S.-British military build-up would culminate in
furthering inter-Arab tensions, estrangement and differences.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Tianjin Municipality, the
largest port in north China, is carrying out a four-month campaign
to crack down on the crimes of smuggling, burglary and robbery
involving motor vehicles.
</P>
<P>
A local police official said that these crimes have become very
serious in recent years, and statistics show that more than 2,000
vehicles have been burglarized or stolen so far this year, two
times more than in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Because these crimes usually feature theft at night and quick
getaways, a nationwide campaign is necessary, the official said,
the Ministry of Public Security has set up a national data base on
all burglarized and stolen vehicle cases and a computer system
linking public security bureaus and stations nationwide for
exchanges of information and consultation.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin also will examine the documents of all vehicles
exported over the past two years. At the same time, the city will
implement intensified administration of the motor vehicle licensing
process and motor repair shops, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the city will launch a drive to stop the
trafficking in stolen motor vehicle, and crack down on unlicensed
vehicles and those with fake licenses.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Remains Low in Kenya in October: Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's inflation declined to
8.3 percent in October from 8.4 percent in September 1998,
according to the November issue of Monthly Economic Review by the
Central Bank of Kenya (KCB) available here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank monthly report predicts that inflation is
expected to remain low for the rest of 1998 and early 1999.
</P>
<P>
The low inflation has mainly been in response to prudent
expansion of money supply, the stability in the Shilling exchange
rate and recent improvements in the supply of basic foods, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
As a result, the overall month-on-month inflation for October
turned out to be the lowest in four years.
</P>
<P>
The report explains that the low inflation in October is
evident in prices of goods and services purchased by the three
income groups with the lower one declining further to 2.4 percent
in October from 3.2 percent in September, the middle one down to
5.9 percent from 6.3 percent in September and the upper income
group down to 6.4 percent from 7.3 percent over the same period.
</P>
<P>
The KCB points out that to keep inflation low, the measures
will have to be continued: annual expansion in broad money supply
be maintained at below 10 percent in the year to June 1999 and
the policy needed to be supplemented by a tight fiscal stance.
</P>
<P>
These measures are expected to allow for a non-inflationary
recovery in economic growth in 1999, the central bank says in its
report.

<HEADLINE> Cooperative Partnership Helps Peace, Stability: ROK President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- President of the Republic of
Korea (ROK) Kim Dae Jung said here today that the cooperative
partnership ROK and China have agreed to forge will help maintain
peace, stability and economic growth in Northeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
During an earlier talk with Chinese President Jiang Zemin, the
two sides agreed to strive for the establishment of a cooperative
partnership for the 21st century, Kim said in a speech delivered
to approximately 700 students and teachers at Beijing University,
where U.S. President Bill Clinton delivered his address earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
"This would mean that the two sides will further expand their
cooperation from mainly economic fields to all other fields,
including the political, economic, cultural and diplomatic
spheres," he said.
</P>
<P>
The ROK president stressed that greater cooperation between the
ROK and China will help ensure a better future for the people of
both countries, and peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia region.
</P>
<P>
The president said that he hopes the two sides can strengthen
their cooperation in such areas as industry, information and
telecommunications, energy and science and technology.
</P>
<P>
Kim, who arrived in Beijing on Wednesday afternoon for a state
visit to China, held talks with President Jiang Zemin today. His
talks with the Chinese president was their seventh summit meeting

<HEADLINE> Scholars Call for International Information Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A number of scholars recently
proposed the establishment of a framework global "Information Law"
covering the acquisition of information, intellectual property,
criminal acts and web security.
</P>
<P>
The made the proposal at an international seminar on
intellectual property rights held here recently.
</P>
<P>
"A series of laws should have certain cross reference points
and relationships which should be taken into consideration when
researching challenges met by the legal system governing
intellectual property from electronic information technology,"
according to Chen Xiaozhu, an official with the Ministry of
Information Industry.
</P>
<P>
Electronic information technology, including microelectronics,
computers and telecommunications, is witnessing rapid development
which has had a great influence on the intellectual property
system.
</P>
<P>
"We must adopt a long-term view regarding trends in the
intellectual property system and the information era in the next
century. We must also continue to research problems related to the
intellectual property system," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
It is essential to protect the exclusive rights of information
and simultaneously encourage the development of new techniques.
</P>
<P>
Experts noted that computer software and integrated circuit
semi-conductors are subject to the duality of industrial property
and copyrights.
</P>
<P>
"The result of ongoing developments will accelerate two
existing trends involving intellectual property," according to
Michael Pantuliano, a senior adviser with the Rogers and Wells Law
Office.
</P>
<P>
"The first is the emergence of a separate body of copyright
laws for electronic works and computer software, and the second is
judicial concepts for using patent laws to resolve electronic
copyright disputes.
</P>
<P>
"Prior to legal resolutions concerning emerging issues,
permissible uses for intellectual property must be accomplished by
establishing rights and solutions for the Internet by contract,"
according to Pantuliano.
</P>
<P>
"Internet piracy is a growing problem shared by all industries
subject to copyrights," said Davis Wang, an employee of the
Microsoft office in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Governments will play a paramount roll in creating and
implementing an effective intellectual property system which will
protect the interests of software developers and the creators of
information transmitted over the Internet," said Wang.

CANBERRA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The preparation for 2004
Olympic Games have gone ahead of Sydney in the same stage, Greek
Minister for Culture Evangelos Venizelos said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Venizelos was speaking after a meeting with Sydney 2000
Olympics Minister Michael Knight and the Sydney Organizing
Committee (SOCOG) chief executive Sandy Hollway.
</P>
<P>
"Preparations in Athens, six years before the games is very
good," Venizelos said. "We have 75 percent of the infra-structure
ready. Six years before the Sydney Olympic Games, only 40 percent
of the whole project was ready."
</P>
<P>
Venizelos also compared Athens' challenges in the lead-up to
the 2004 Games to the problems being experienced by Sydney in
planning its transport infra-structure for the 2000 Games.
</P>
<P>
"Here in Sydney, for example, the transportation problem, the
problem of circulation, is very difficult," Venizelos said.
</P>
<P>
"Athens, not now, but in the perspective of 2004 with the new
ring road, with the new underground (railway), with the new
airport, I hope will be much better."

LONDON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony
Blair on Thursday warned that Iraq must comply with the U.N.
resolutions over arms inspection in Iraq, otherwise military
action will follow.
</P>
<P>
Blair told BBC radio that there were no signs that the Iraqi
government is doing anything other than continuing to flout the
agreement reached between Iraq and U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan.
</P>
<P>
"It is with the utmost regret that we find ourselves in this
position. We have bent over backwards to try and accommodate any
reasonable demands," Blair said.
</P>
<P>
Blair stressed: "We all want to see a solution to this that
doesn't involve force, but we cannot have a solution that allow
him (Iraqi President Saddam Hussein) to break the agreement."
</P>
<P>
On whether compliance could be achieved without major loss of
life, Blair said: "I am convinced that it can be done in a way
that targets very specifically his military capability and the
weapons of mass destruction he has been building."
</P>
<P>
The United States is preparing to launch air strikes against
Iraq after Baghdad announced early this month suspension of all
cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors in Iraq.

<HEADLINE> HK Mass Transit Firm Signs 4B Dollar Syndicated Loan Facility </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Mass Transit
Railway (MTR) Corporation signed Thursday an agreement for a
4.125-billion-HK-dollar (529 million U.S. dollars) syndicated loan
 facility with 21 banks from across the world.
</P>
<P>
The facility will be used to finance the corporation's Tseung
Kwan O extension.
</P>
<P>
The facility comes in two tranches with maturities of three and
five years. It can be drawn and repaid on a revolving basis for
the initial 18 months following which it will become a term loan
facility.
</P>
<P>
Interest margins are 0.65 percent per annum over Hong Kong
Interbank Offering Rates (HIBOR) for three years and 0.95 percent
per annum over HIBOR for five years.
</P>
<P>
Jack So, chairman of the MTR Corporation, said that the
transaction had attracted such an enthusiastic response from the
international banking community.
</P>
<P>
With a syndicate of 21 major banks from Hong Kong, China's
mainland, Singapore, Australia, Europe and North America, "this
transaction is believed to be the largest syndicated loan facility
raised in Hong Kong so far this year both in terms of the amount
of funds raised and the number of banks participating," So said at
the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Inclusive of this facility, his corporation has successfully
raised new financing in excess of 10 billion HK dollars (1.3
billion U.S. dollars) year-to-date, despite the difficult market
environment, So said.
</P>
<P>
"All of these suggest that the corporation has continued to be
regarded as a top quality credit by the financial community," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on behalf of the bank syndicate, Jeff Mitchell of
National Australia Bank hailed the MTR corporation as one of the
world's most successful and profitable railway operators.
</P>
<P>
Despite the regional economic turmoil and a general tightening
in liquidity conditions globally, this transaction has been
received and supported most positively in the primary debt market,
the banker noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A senior official said here
Thursday that Hong Kong would not interfere with the judicial
proceedings in the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
In response to the sentences passed on Cheung Tze Keung and 17
other Hong Kong residents by the Guangzhou Municipal Intermediate
People's Court Thursday, Secretary for Security Regina Ip said:
"This is not the first time Hong Kong residents are convicted and
sentenced outside Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
She noted that as these persons were tried in the mainland for
offenses committed there under the mainland laws, the mainland's
laws regarding criminal offenses applied.
</P>
<P>
The persons convicted had the right to appeal against the
conviction and the sentence and they might lodge their appeal to
the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Court within 10 days, she
said.
</P>
<P>
"We respect the independence of the judicial systems of other
jurisdictions. Likewise, we would not interfere with the judicial
proceedings in the mainland," she said.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that these Hong Kong people were tried in the
mainland under the mainland's criminal law.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of the mainland interfering with Hong
Kong's jurisdiction. Hong Kong people's faith in the independence
of our judicial system should not be eroded," she said.

Cheung Tze Keung, ringleader of a 36-member gang which
committed a series of felonies in Hong Kong and Chinese mainland,

HONG KONG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong people care about
the quality of life both for the present and future generations, a
government survey showed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Planning Department Thursday published a Public
Consultation Report which contains views of the public on "Study
on Sustainable Development for the 21st Century."
</P>
<P>
"It is encouraging to note that most respondents did express
concerns about the quality of life both for the present and future
generations. Such concern is, in fact, a key element of
sustainable development," said a government spokesman Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A majority of those surveyed considered economic factors, such
as employment and income, are more important than the quality of
the environment. "This is not surprising given the current
economic situation in Hong Kong," said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Most respondents accept that there should be a better
integration of, and balance between, economic, social and
environmental considerations when the government formulates
policies and makes decisions.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the overall response has been supportive of
the government's initiatives and the great majority of respondents
are in favor of sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
To solicit public views on the issue, the Planning Department

<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Defending world champion Cuba
spiked their way to the title of the world women's championship
as they overpowered China in straight sets here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the first set the Cubans eased to a 15-4 victory without
meeting any serious resistance from the Asian champion China, who
failed to display their quick attack under the firepower from the
Caribbeans.
</P>
<P>
China managed to grab three points in a row trailing 0-7
behind but their momentum was snapped and did not find any more
chances to fight back into the game.
</P>
<P>
But the Asians took advantage of Cuba's errors and failure to
concentrate in the second set, fighting to 14-all only to see two
service aces from the Cubans ended the play.
</P>
<P>
China led the third set 12-7 but Cuba, unbeaten throughout the
championships, fought back to seal the victory with a score of
15-12.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's final was the repeat of 1996 Atlanta Olympics
battle for gold, in which China lost in four sets then.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans have shown they are of a different class by winning
all the matches here, while China sailed into the final after
defeating Russia in straight sets in a semifinal on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Cuban player Regla Torres Herrera, who turns 23 next month,
was named the Best Player of the tournament, while Cuban head
coach Antonio Perdomo honored the Best Coach.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Russia rallied from one set down in the
third-place playoff to beat Brazil, avenging their loss in the
Atlanta Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
It took the Russians nearly two hours to win 13-15, 15-6,
15-11, 15-13.
</P>
<P>
Italy finished fifth after beating Croatia 15-7, 15-10, 15-8,
while the Netherlands were seventh following their 15-12, 3-15,
15-10, 15-8 win over hosts Japan.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Trial Transcript on Display in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- A transcript of the verdict
handed down at the well-known Tokyo Trial has gone on display as
of today in Beijing's Chinese Revolutionary Museum.
</P>
<P>
The transcript was the work of Mei Ru'ao, chief judge at the
Tokyo Trial. Mei's family presented the transcript to the
museum. The document was stored in the home of a close relative
living in Hong Kong for some 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Mei's widow Xiao Kan, 83, and members of the family also
donated the judge's robe and a number of other precious
photographs. The family made the donation to mark the 50th
anniversary of the verdict rendered by the Far East International
Military Tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The court sentenced seven principal Japanese war criminals to
death by hanging. The 100,000-word written version of the verdict
was prepared over an eight-day period.
</P>
<P>
Mei, a Chinese judge who had studied law in the United States
in his early years and earned a Doctorate of Law from the
University of Chicago, was on a panel of 10 additional Allied
judges hearing the cases of Japanese war criminals. The intricate
trial procedures were completed over a 30-month period.
</P>
<P>
Mei worked as an advisor to the Chinese Foreign Ministry
following the founding of New China on October 1, 1949. Judge Mei
passed away in China in 1973 at the age of 69.
</P>
<P>
"Now that the transcript is stored here, I'm at ease, since it
belongs to the people," said silver-haired Xiao Kan, Mei's widow,
with a smile on her face.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- General Zhang Wannian,
vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission, met today with
former U.S. Defense Secretary Harold Brown.
</P>
<P>
Zhang noted hard-won achievements in the Sino-US relations, and
said that both sides should extend greater efforts to maintain
and develop relations.
</P>
<P>
History attests that properly handling the Taiwan Issue, the
key point in Sino-US relations, has a direct influence on the
development of bilateral relations, said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese leader reviewed the development of Sino-US
relations, and pointed to the good trend in state-to-state and
military relations. The Sino-U.S. agreement for establishing a
constructive strategic partnership geared to the 21st century has
established a sound framework and appropriate direction for the
development of bilateral relations, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
He said Brown's visit will promote exchanges between strategic
research institutes and strengthen bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Brown, a senior consultant with the U.S. Research Center on
Strategic and International Issues, pointed to China's increasing
national power and said the country will play an even more
important role in regional and international affairs.
</P>
<P>
U.S.-China relations have a major impact on global peace and
stability and the two countries should strive to ensure bilateral
ties remain on the right track, said Brown.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seeks to Cut Red Tape for Foreign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian investment
authorities plan to seek more foreign capital by cutting red tape
and solving other existing problems.
</P>
<P>
Executive Director of the Tanzania Investment Center (TIC),
Samuel Sitta, was quoted Thursday by a media report as saying
that bureaucracy has scared off a lot of foreign investors like
South Korean auto giant Hyundai.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai had waited for two years for an industrial license to
open a multi-million U.S. Dollar auto assembly plant in Tanzania
but failed at last, he said, adding that in 1992 the frustrated
investor shifted investment in Botswana.
</P>
<P>
Sitta, who was addressing reporters in Dar es Salaam
Wednesday, said his center had also received numerous complaints
from other investors.
</P>
<P>
Since 1990, he said, 1,086 projects with a total capital of
3.4 billion U.S. Dollars have been set up in the country,
creating 175,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
However, the unemployment rate in the country, with a
population of more than 30 million, could be as high as 40
percent, officials with the Ministry of Youth and Labor
Development said.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the TIC, he said foreign investors applying for
licenses have to go through cumbersome procedures with a long
list of government agencies, such as Tanzania Revenue Authority,
ministries of Home Affairs, Industries and Trade, Justice and
Constitutional Affairs, Lands and Settlement Development,
Administration and Local Government, as well as the Prime
Minister's Office.
</P>
<P>
The investors were also discouraged by problems in clearing
goods at harbors or airports, high taxes, corruption, which deny
the country revenue sources, acquisition of technology and job
opportunities, he said.
</P>
<P>
TIC will discuss with investment regulators, members of the
business community and donors to find ways of creating a
conducive environment for foreign investors, he said.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Protects Wetlands Along Rift Valley </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, November 12 (Xinhua) - Tanzania has urged the
states along the Rift Valley to protect their wetlands for the
benefit of man, animals and plants, local press reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Magnus Ngoile, Director General of the National Environmental
Management Council (NEMC) told a workshop here Wednesday that
wetlands provide diverse values and functions not only to the
mankind, but also to the fauna and flora in the region.
</P>
<P>
"They include agricultural, hydrological, ecological and
social values and functions which attract many human beings,
fauna and flora to seek habitation," he said, inaugurating a
national awareness workshop on Rift Valley Biodiversity project
to conserve wetlands.
</P>
<P>
Ngoile said that Tanzania, covered by wetlands at seven
percent of its total surface area, has witnessed one of the
highest rates of population growth in the areas around Lake
Victoria.
</P>
<P>
He said that surveys show that the population, which has more
than doubled in the past three decades with an average fertility
rate of higher than 5.6 children, has outstripped natural
resources.
</P>
<P>
Ngoile said that despite all these immense ecological and
socio-economic values, wetlands are continually being depleted.
</P>
<P>
National Co-ordinator for the Rift Valley Lakes Biodiversity
Project, Wilfred Sarunday, also briefed the participants of a
regional project, which is estimated to cost over 10 million U.S.
Dollars, to protect the wetlands.
</P>
<P>
"The project has already received a funding from the United
Nations amounting to 350,000 U.S. Dollars for the initial
consultation report study," Sarunday said.

<HEADLINE> Nine More Parties to Compete in 1999 S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Another nine political
parties in South Africa have registered to compete in 1999
general elections, Sowetan daily reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
These parties are listed among the 15 already registered with
the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC), along with giants the
ruling African National Congress (ANC), the opposition National
Party and the Inkatha Freedom Party.
</P>
<P>
Of the nine parties, the major ones are the Keep It Straight
and Simple (Kiss), which attracted a few hundred votes in 1994,
and the ultra-right wing Conservative Party, whose voice may add
to the Afrikaner "own affairs" in parliament currently
represented by the Freedom Front.
</P>
<P>
The Azanian People's Organization (Azapo), which boycotted the
1994 elections, has also resolved to fight the 1999 elections.
It's election to parliament, and of the newly-established
Socialist Party of Azania (SOPA), may add impetus to the
liberation movements' voice, political sources said.
</P>
<P>
SOPA last week registered as a political party and intens to
register as a participant in the 1999 elections, its chairman
Lybon Mabasa announced Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Another significant participant will be the United Democratic
Movement led by former ANC leader Bantu Holomisa and former
National Party leader Roelf Meyer.
</P>
<P>
According to IEC authorities, the registration of political
parties alone does not entitle them to participate in elections.
To participate in any election parties have to submit candidates'
lists by a date yet to be determined in the election timetable.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 general election, the second of its kind since South
Africa abolished apartheid in 1994, is due to be held in May next
year.

<HEADLINE> Investors Show Interest in Niteria's Public Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six local and foreign
investors have indicated their interest in eight of Nigeria's
public companies slated for privatization, Nigerian Head of State
General Abdulsalam Abubakar disclosed.
</P>
<P>
Opening the fifth Nigerian Economic Summit Wednesday in
capital Abuja, the head of state said that the investors had been
given six weeks to submit their proposals on the enterprises they
have shown interest in, This Day reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign investors are from the United States,
Britain, Canada, Belgium and South Africa, Abubakar said.
</P>
<P>
The Bureau for Public Enterprises (BPE) which handles the
commercialization and privatization of public enterprises in
Nigeria last month advertized the sale of some government
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Public firms on the privatization list include the National
Electric Power Authority, Nigeria Telecommunications Limited,
three refinery and petrochemical companies, steel plants, paper
and fertilizer companies.
</P>
<P>
According to the Nigerian government, 40 percent of its stake
in each of the affected enterprises would be sold to core
investors, 20 percent to Nigerians through the mechanism of the
Nigerian Stock Exchange while the government intends to retain
the remaining 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said that the government intended to complete the
privatization of some of the key enterprises before the May 29,
1999 handover date and restated his government's commitment to
economic reform to promote efficiency in public enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He revealed that about 14 anti-competition laws had been
abrogated, indicating the Nigerian government's determination to
throw the economy open to competition.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar noted that the 1999 budget will pay particular
attention to short-term measures that will enable the nation
develop its human capital in the field of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The National Agency for Science and Engineering Infrastructure
will be restructured and strengthened to become a key catalyst in
the promotion of small and medium enterprises in the engineering
sector, he said.

political parties to arrive at a consensus to resolve the ethnic
conflict and restore lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
The other decisions taken included the setting up of a task
force to facilitate the peace process, the inclusion of
representatives of minority groups in the dialogue and finally
bringing Tamil rebels in the process of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has long been plagued by conflicts between the
majority Sinhalese and the minority Tamils.
</P>
<P>
The Tamil rebels have been fighting for a separate Tamil state
in the north and east of the country since 1983. So far over
55,000 people have been killed in the war.

<HEADLINE> India, Pakistan Fail to Reach Understanding on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- India and Pakistan failed to
reach any understanding on their perceptions on terrorism and
narcotic smuggling at their bilateral talks held here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A brief joint statement issued after the talks merely said that
the two sides stated their respective positions and agreed to
continue their discussions during the next round of dialogue.
</P>
<P>
The Indian delegation, led by Home Secretary B. P. Singh,
placed on record during the talks what they described as concrete
evidence regarding Islamabad's role in sponsoring and harboring
terrorist activities, reliable sources here said.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side pointed towards sophisticated weapons which
they claimed were seized last week from Pakistan-backed militants
and spurt in drug trafficking on the northern and western border.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani delegation, led by Interior Secretary Hafeezullah
Ishaq, refuted New Delhi's allegations that it was sponsoring
cross-border terrorism with the Inter Services Intelligence
stepping up attempts to push foreign mercenaries into Jammu and
Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
However, the joint statement said the talks, held as part of
the on-going composite and integrated dialogue between the two
countries, were held in a frank and cordial atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
India also raised the issue of border fencing which it said was
helpful in checking infiltration, smuggling and drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
On the drug smuggling issue, the two sides discussed measures
to check the flow of narcotics from Afghanistan and Pakistan
through India's northern borders.
</P>
<P>
The two neighbors held their first round of talks Tuesday on
commerce and trade with initial signs showing that only marginal
headway has been made in resolving key issues relating to
telecommunications, railways and the power sector.
</P>
<P>
The two countries failed to make any progress Monday on their
long-pending Sir Creek maritime boundary dispute with New Delhi
firmly rejecting Islamabad's proposal for third party arbitration.
But the talks were also reportedly held in a frank and cordial
atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
The current round of talks is the second phase of the scheduled
nine-day dialogue between the two countries which has so far not
turned out any positive results on three of the six outstanding
identified issues.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations on a navigation project and the Siachen Glacier
held here last week also ended in a deadlock.

</P>
<P>
"There was also a bit of profit-taking as well in the afternoon

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Ends Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar took
heart from stronger than expected employment data released
Thursday which appeared to close the door on a near term interest
rate cut, and closed stronger but off the session's high at 63.42.
</P>
<P>
The remarkable employment data released Thursday initially gave
the market cause for cheer. But the gloss soon wore off and the
local currency suffered when the market realized the figures were
heavily reliant on the part-time employment component.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar closed at 63.04 U.S. cents, from 62.93,
after trading between 62.97 and 63.42 U.S. cents.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics released the October
employment figures showing a fall in unemployment to 7.7 percent,
from 8.1 percent in September.
</P>
<P>
Although the news gave the market a bullish tone, Colonial
State Bank treasury manager Nick Volanakis said the market began
to backtrack after realizing most of the strength in the rise came
from part-time employment.
</P>
<P>
"The market was a little bit disappointed and sold the
Australian dollar off," he said.
</P>
<P>
Continued weakness in the Japanese yen also contributed to the
fall in the local currency.
</P>
<P>
Volanakis said the market was skeptical about the financial
package announced by the Japanese government designed to stimulate
the economy.
</P>
<P>
"It is certainly a positive," Volanakis said. "But the exchange
rate is not reflecting that at this stage."
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar finished the local session at 77.48
Japanese yen from 76.02 and 1.0605 German marks from 1.0576.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Building Industry Crippled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Failure to get affordable
credit financing and unrestricted imports of pre-manufactured
construction goods has crippled the construction industry in
Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Speaking Wednesday here at the monthly meeting of the
Economics Association of Zambia (EAZ), Francis Ndilila, President
of the National Council for Construction (NCC) stressed that the
construction industry in Zambia needed a level of protective
measures and an incubation period to mobilize and strengthen it.
</P>
<P>
Ndilila, quoted by Times of Zambia Thursday, noted that the
industry had been well geared to play a role in stimulating the
country's economy by adding value to raw materials including some
waste, imparting of skills and the employment of large work
forces.
</P>
<P>
Due to the high cost of borrowing in Zambia at the moment,
much of the industry has not been able to get financing and
strengthen operations, while those that have borrowed have ended
up being highly uncompetitive on the market especially against
foreign firms, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
Because of certain incentives that were available to some
foreign firms, said Ndilila, they were able to offer discount on
their quotations by as much as 15 percent, a concession which no
Zambian construction firm could afford.
</P>
<P>
He added that prior to the liberalization of the country's
economy in the early 1990s, the construction industry was
self-sufficient in 70 percent of its requirements.
</P>
<P>
Cheaper imports, including such items as window frames, had
completely emasculated this capacity, said the NCC president.

<HEADLINE> Cuba Claims World Women's Championship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OSAKA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Defending world champion Cuba
spiked their way to the title of the world women's championship
as they overpowered China in straight sets here on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In the first set the Cubans eased to a 15-4 victory without
meeting any serious resistance from the Asian champion China, who
failed to display their quick attack under the firepower from the
Caribbeans.
</P>
<P>
China managed to grab three points in a row trailing 0-7
behind but their momentum was snapped and did not find any more
chances to fight back into the game.
</P>
<P>
But the Asians took advantage of Cuba's errors and failure to
concentrate in the second set, fighting to 14-all only to see two
service aces from the Cubans ended the play.
</P>
<P>
China led the third set 12-7 but Cuba, unbeaten throughout the
championships, fought back to seal the victory with a score of
15-12.
</P>
<P>
Thursday's final was the repeat of 1996 Atlanta Olympics
battle for gold, in which China lost in four sets then.
</P>
<P>
The Cubans have shown they are of a different class by winning
all the matches here, while China sailed into the final after
defeating Russia in straight sets in a semifinal on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Philippines Aims for Lower Growth Target Next Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Thursday that it is willing to aim for a lower growth target next
year of anywhere between 2 percent and 2.5 percent and a lower
budget deficit target of 30 billion pesos (750 million U.S.
dollars), so as not to put pressure on domestic financing.
</P>
<P>
Finance Secretary Edgardo Espiritu said that the International
Monetary Fund (IMF) has indicated that it is willing to allow the
Philippines a higher budgetary ceiling next year to enable the
government to provide fiscal stimulus to promote the economy.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the Philippines are discussing a high budget
deficit target of up to 60 billion pesos (1.5 billion dollars)
which would allow the country to post its original growth target
range of 3 percent to 3.5 percent and a lower budget deficit
target of 30 billion pesos.
</P>
<P>
But Espiritu said that he is worried that in financing a higher
budget deficit, more pressure would be exerted on domestic
financing.
</P>
<P>
These could mean that the government would have to borrow more
to finance a higher deficit and market may bid up Treasury bills,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary said that the government is more keen on keeping
low interest rates and would not want to drive up Treasury bill
rates in order to finance a higher budget deficit.

<HEADLINE> APEC Senior Officials Work on Finalizing Credible </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Senior officials of Asia-
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) are trying to build up a
credible package for trade liberalization for the APEC member
economies.
</P>
<P>
"We are working towards finalizing the package on EVSL (Early
Voluntary Sectoral Liberalization) which is part of liberalization
program for APEC," said Abdul Razak Ramly, chairman of the senior
officials meeting, at a press conference after their first-day
meeting here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are progressing. The package would cover all the nine
sectors, for which there is almost a consensus on non-tariffs,
rates and end-dates, with all economies on board," he said.
</P>
<P>
The nine sectors include chemicals, environmental goods and
services, energy, fish and fish products, forest products, gems
and jewelry, medical equipment and instruments, toys and
telecommunications mutual recognition arrangement.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Razak said the officials were also instructed to quicken
the process for liberalization of other six sectors --
automobiles, civil aircraft, food, natural and synthetic rubber,
fertilizers and oilseeds.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the officials also looked at Individual Action
Plans (IAPs), Collective Action Plans (CAPs), he said.
</P>
<P>
The chairman said the officials also looked at the management
of APEC process and this was finalized for endorsement by the
ministers who will meet here on November 14 and 15.
</P>
<P>
Abdul Razak said there were several recommendations for "making
APEC more relevant".
</P>
<P>
"We also finalized several papers for ministers to look at,
which include report on impact of expanding population and
economic growth on food, energy and environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Another matter the officials dealt with was to look at the
blueprint on e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
The two-day senior officials' meeting is preparing for the 10th
ministerial meeting on November 14-15 and for the informal meeting
of APEC leaders on November 17-18.

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Send Delegation to Iran for POWs Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Iraq will send a delegation to
Iran within the following days to urge Iran to release the rest of
Iraqi prisoners of war (POWs) as soon as possible, an Iraqi
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Zawra weekly quoted an official source in Iraqi Foreign
Ministry as saying that Tehran had officially pledged nine months
ago it would close the file of POWs and MIAs (missing in actions).
</P>
<P>
The source said that Iraq has fulfilled all its obligations
toward Iran and released all Iranian POWs and other detainees
captured in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement signed last February, the two countries
agreed to release POWs already registered by the International
Committee of Red Cross (ICRC).
</P>
<P>
Iran should provide Iraq with all available information
concerning those unregistered POWs and MIAs according to the
agreement, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The source expected that Iran would cooperate in the coming
negotiations with the Iraqi delegation to solve the issues of
POWs and MIAs.
</P>
<P>
Iran and Iraq, two former foes which fought a bitter war from
1980 to 1988, have stepped up efforts to solve long-standing
issues between them.
</P>
<P>
Last April, these two countries repatriated some 6,000 POWs
and MIAs, the largest swap since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Trade ministers of the two nations attended trade fairs held
recently in both countries in a bid to boost trade and economic
cooperation.

CAIRO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic
briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Six new projects will be implemented in the Free Zone
of Ismailia, about 110 kilometers northeast of Cairo.
</P>
<P>
They include diesel engine plants, water pumps and storehouses
for spare parts, furnitures, wood and raw materials, Egypt's
Middle East News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The projects with a total capital of 37 million U.S. dollars
are expected to create about 3,000 job opportunities.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Foreign investments in Lebanon are expected to grow
by 30 percent this year to 430 million U.S. dollars, a United
Nations report has said.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Star Wednesday quoted the report as saying that
Lebanon received 331 million dollars in foreign direct investment
in 1997 compared with 187 million dollars in 1996 and 107 million
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike portfolio investment, this is productive investment
that creates jobs and uses local brains," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign firms were becoming more enthusiastic about investing
in Lebanon as a result of an improving exchange rate and an
investor-friendly government, the report added.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon's Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has called
on relevant parliamentary committees to discuss the drafting of
the long-awaited copyright laws, the Arabic daily As Safir
reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The daily said the renewed interest in such laws coincides
with the United States Secretary of Commerce William M.Daley's
visit to Lebanon on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Daley is to be accompanied by American businessmen and bankers
willing to study the possibilities of investing in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. has been requesting the Lebanese government to take
strict measures to crack down on the technological piracy which
the U.S. claimed is spreading across the country.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- Lebanon is expected to start a massive agricultural
survey this month in a bid to have accurate information on the
country's agriculture, the Daily Star reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese Ministry of Agriculture carried out surveys in 1961
and 1997 but there was doubt about their validity and accuracy.
</P>
<P>
Critics argued that many of the figures were unreliable
because many areas and farmers were not included.
</P>
<P>
The ministry estimated the country's cultivated land at
296,554 hectares, of which 44 percent are in eastern Lebanon's
Bekaa Valley and 27 percent in the north and 21 percent in the
southern areas.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran announced on Wednesday that the government has
paid 100 billion U.S. dollars of subsidies on energy and fuel in
the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Hassan Qadiri, secretary of the Iranian cabinet's
information department told the official news agency IRNA that
currently, the crude price is about 11 dollars a barrel and
petrol is 15 dollars a barrel while the Iranian government sells
gas oil 1.5 dollars a barrel and petrol about six dollars a
barrel on the domestic market.
</P>
<P>
The low cost of fuels in Iran has encouraged over-consumption
by the Iranian nationals to the extent that the government has
been forced to import refined oil from abroad, the official said,
adding it also has encouraged economic saboteurs to smuggle fuels
to Iran's neighbors.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkey's Istanbul Stock Exchange National-100 Index
plunged 15.39 percent in heavy trading Wednesday to close at 2,141
points amid concerns over the growing scandal involving arrested
businessman Kormaz Yigit.
</P>
<P>
Local Daily News reported Thursday that investors, fearing
that the scandal could bring Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz's
coalition government down, unloaded shares on the market.
</P>
<P>
Yigit was taken into custody Monday night on charges that he
had used funds from Bank Express, a small bank he owned, for his
own companies far beyond legal limits and had enlisted the help of
a Mafia kingpin in the privatization tender of Turkish Trade Bank.
</P>
<P>
Shares prices dropped 375 points Wednesday in one of the
biggest drops in the short history of the exchange due to this
trade scandal.

nonproliferation, said Holum, adding that related efforts will
further promote the development of Sino-US ties.

CANBERRA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Australian Prime Minister
John Howard will raise Australia's concerns about the political
crackdown in Malaysia during bilateral talks with Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad at next week's APEC meeting in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
While speaking in parliament Thursday, Howard refused to join
an international boycott of meetings with Mahathir over the arrest
of former Malaysian deputy prime minister and finance minister
Anwar Ibrahim, saying the close ties between the two countries are
too important.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton and Canadian Prime Minister Jean
Chretien have both canceled meetings with Mahathir, host of this
year's Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders informal
meeting, in protest against the political developments in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australia would not blindly follow the lead of
countries which are not part of the region.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's very important in circumstances such as this,
given the character of our relationship and given the importance
of the bilateral relationship and the fact we are part of this
region, that we don't just automatically follow the stances of
countries that are not part of this region," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I will be talking in a very open and constructive fashion to
the prime minister of Malaysia," he said.
</P>
<P>
Howard also raised concerns about the stand taken by Japan to
delay a key APEC agreement which will accelerate free trade in 15
key sectors and will help smooth the path of 40-percent of the
regional trade.
</P>
<P>
Japan is refusing to lift trade barriers to its forestry and
fisheries industries and is set to offer struggling Asian
countries up to 300 million Australian dollars (190 million U.S.
dollars) in aid in return for supporting the stand in Kuala
Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
Howard said it is important for APEC to maintain a commitment
to free trade.

</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- According to an inquiry, only one in two -- if not three --
children who are treated in hospitals in France can have their
pains relieved. Among the causes are negligence by medical staff
and their failure to modernize paediatric hospitals in France.
</P>
<P>
-- Thirty-five years after General Charles de Gaulle and 17
years after Francois Mitterrand, Jacques Chirac was due to begin
on Thursday an official visit to Mexico to pursue the French
diplomatic offensive in Latin America which was launched by him a

-- The crisis between Iraq and the United States has
intensified as U.S. President Bill Clinton gave a new warning to

U.N. arms inspectors, Clinton said he still preferred a diplomatic
solution.
</P>
<P>
-- The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has called on France

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Opposed to Military Strikes Against Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia is against
military strikes planned by the United States and Britain to
punish Iraq for its standoff with the United Nations Special
Commission (UNSCOM) responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Foreign Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said Thursday
the international community could not be expected to accept the
position that Iraq had lost its legitimate right to protect its
interest and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, Malaysia considers that Iraq has the
legitimate right to protect its interest, and trusts that Iraq at
the same time will also fully comply with United Nations Security
Council resolutions and immediately review its recent actions," he
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said the latest round of standoff between Iraq and
UNSCOM and the imminent military strikes, triggered by Iraq's
announcement on October 31 that it was halting the activities of
UNSCOM, were a matter of deep concern.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia regretted that since the signing of the
agreement between Iraq and United Nations Secretary-General Kofi
Annan a year ago for Iraq's continued cooperation with the weapons
inspectors, the council had failed to move forward in fostering
confidence-building measures to prevent the present standoff.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia remains opposed to any unilateral use of military
force and believes that continued dialogue and consultations
between the United Nations Secretary-General and Iraq is essential
to maintain the U.N. regime to monitor Iraq's weapons programs,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah said such consultations should also include a
full-fledged review of the U.N. resolutions on Iraq with a view to
an early lifting of the trade embargo and addressing Iraq's
legitimate concerns over the impartiality of UNSCOM and chief
weapons inspector Richard Butler.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia did not believe that Iraq wished to
deliberately undermine the UNSCOM mechanism but its actions were
more to question the sincerity and neutrality of UNSCOM and its
leadership.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said the eight-year-old sanctions against
Iraq imposed for its 1990 invasion of Kuwait had inflicted
excessive damage to the country and its people and any unilateral
military action would be totally ill-conceived and would undermine
regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah appealed to all parties concerned to exercise maximum
restraint and not to abandon diplomatic means to resolve the
standoff under any circumstances.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia calls on the U.N. Secretary-General to intervene and
seek an amicable resolution on the basis of building understanding
and trust between Iraq and UNSCOM," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's remarks on the Iraq-UNSCOM standoff came amid U.S.
warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning a major
buildup of warplanes and troops with President Bill Clinton
warning that it would be a costly mistake for Iraq to spurn U.N.
demands for arms inspections.

<HEADLINE> Israel Reopens Gas Mask Distribution Centers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, November 12 (Xinhua) -- To prepare for the U.S. air
strike on Iraq, the Israeli government has ordered the army to
reopen all of its gas mask distribution centers nationwide to the
public from Thursday to let people update their masks.
</P>
<P>
The government also urged the public to update their chemical
warfare protection kids in light of what Israeli defense officials
see as an inevitable U.S. strike on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Media reports Thursday quoted Israeli senior defense officials
as saying that the current situation in the Gulf indicates a high
probability of an American attack on Iraq, but at the same time
they stressed that the probability of an Iraqi missile attack on
Israel was low.
</P>
<P>
The move to redistribute protection kids in Israel probably
came as U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen has ordered a major
buildup of U.S. military forces in the Gulf, and U.S. President
Bill Clinton Wednesday warned again Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
that time was running out for him to comply with the United
Nations demand to cooperate with weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Iraq decided on October 31 to halt all forms of cooperation
with U.N. inspectors until the U.N. Security Council moves
toward lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after
its invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Thursday
which condemned the Iraqi non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who has been in close touch with Israeli Defense
Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, signed an order for 129 additional
aircraft, including bombers and stealth jets, to deploy in the
Gulf along with more than 3,000 troops.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said here Wednesday
night that he was in continuous touch with the Americans over the
Iraqi issue, and the government will give the public all
relevant instructions on security protection if necessary.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai has reportedly gave his full backing to the United
States and the Defense Ministry said it and the Israel Defense
Forces are in constant communication with their U.S. colleagues
over the matter of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. State Department has authorized the non-essential
persons of the U.S. embassy and consulate in Israel to return
home if they wanted to.

<HEADLINE> China's Hydro-Electric Power Industry Has Great Potential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China will add 5 million kw of
hydro-electric power generating capacity, on average, annually
from 2000 to 2010, meaning a large market for overseas
businesses and consortia.
</P>
<P>
According to a senior official at the China State Power
Corporation, China has the most hydro-electric power resources in
the world, estimated at 376 million kw.
</P>
<P>
But, he added, a lot needs to be done to exploit them. China's
total hydro-electric power generating capacity accounts for only
13.8 percent of the total exploitable potential at present.
</P>
<P>
According to a mid-term and long-term development plan, China
will have a total hydro-electric power capacity of 70 million kw
by the year 2000. By 2010, it will increase to 125 million kw, or
33.1 percent of the country's exploitable hydro-electric power
resources.
</P>
<P>
Overseas funds have helped China's hydro-electric power
development, the official said.
</P>
<P>
China has 23 large hydro-electric power projects in operation
or under construction that used nearly four billion U.S. dollars
worth of overseas funds, for a generating capacity of more than
18.84 million kw.
</P>
<P>
China has achieved a lot in developing its hydro-electric power
industry in the past four decades, and especially since the
beginning of the reforms and opening-up in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The total generating capacity and annual electricity output
have risen from 163,000 kw and 710 million kwh in 1949 to the
present 52.17 million kw and 186.8 billion kwh, respectively.
</P>
<P>
China ranks third in hydro-electric power generating capacity
and production in the world.

<P>
-- In light of what Israeli defense officials see as an

<HEADLINE> Qatari FM on Possibility of Military Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister
Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassem Bin Jabir al-Thani has said that military
strikes against Iraq could be launched before the end of November
if diplomatic efforts fail to solve the Iraq-U.N. standoff.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Kuwait's Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam
published on Thursday, the Qatari minister expressed hope that
diplomatic efforts to defuse the tensions between Iraq and the
United Nations would succeed.
</P>
<P>
"But I can say that the trend for a military strike is
growing and I believe it is going to be before the end
of the current month," He said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that Doha had informed the Iraqi regime that the
situation "is very critical" and that Iraq should restore its
cooperation with the United Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM)
in charge of disarming Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The situation reached a stage where diplomatic solutions are
no longer viable," the Qatari foreign minister said.
</P>
<P>
His remarks came several days after U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen visited Qatar last week.
</P>
<P>
Tensions escalated between Iraq and the United Nations after
Iraq decided on October 31 to halt all forms of cooperation with
UNSCOM inspectors until the U.N. Security Council moves toward
lifting the U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq in 1990 after its
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council adopted a resolution last Thursday
which condemned the Iraqi non-cooperation with U.N. arms
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
All U.N. staff except core officials left Iraq Wednesday amid
the current Iraq-U.N. standoff in a sign that the U.S. might
launch military attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The United States has threatened to carry out military strikes
against Iraq if diplomatic efforts fail to force Baghdad to resume
cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors and abide by the
U.N. Security Council resolutions related to its invasion of
Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> 40 More U.N. Relief Workers Pull out From Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. pulled out another 40
relief workers from Iraq on Thursday morning, leaving only about
30 humanitarian staff in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
This is the second batch of withdrawal of U.N. relief workers
from Iraq. On Wednesday afternoon, 130 people were already
evacuated from Iraq to Amman, Jordan, as "precautionary measure."
</P>
<P>
U.N. humanitarian officials have warned that the reduction of
U.N. humanitarian staff in Iraq will inevitably slow down the
implementation of U.N. humanitarian program in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hans von Sponeck, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Iraq
(UNOHCI), told a press conference on Wednesday evening that
UNOHCI's capacity had been much reduced.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a quite slow-down of the delivery of food and
medicine," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Special Commission for disarming Iraq (UNSCOM)
withdrew all its remaining personnel, about 90 people, from Iraq
on Wednesday morning, a sign that the United States will probably
take military actions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq on October 31 decided to halt all forms of cooperation
with UNSCOM, a move that was condemned by the Security Council on
November 5.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain have been threatening since then
to take military strikes to force Iraq to reverse its decision.

<HEADLINE> Africa Attracts 3% of FDI Flows to Developing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Excluding South Africa,
foreign direct investment (FDI) flows to Africa were just three
percent of the total flows to developing countries in 1997, with
a volume of 4.71 billion U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the 1998 World Investment Report published
Wednesday by the United Nations Conference on Trade and
Development, FDI flows to Africa excluding South Africa decreased
to 4.71 billion Dollars in 1997 from 4.828 billion Dollars in
1996.
</P>
<P>
However, the FDI flows to Africa went to relatively few
countries. The largest five recipients -- Nigeria, Egypt,
Morocco, Tunisia and Angola accounted for two-thirds of the
total.
</P>
<P>
The report pointed out that FDI flows to Africa reflect real
differentiation between countries that enjoy political stability,
are securing growth and enhancing their investment environment
and other countries.
</P>
<P>
The report said, FDI to South Africa rose last year to 1.7
billion Dollars from 760 million Dollars in 1996, largely
reflecting a number of privatizations, which included the 30
percent sale of Telkom, as well as sales of six radio stations,
the domestic airline Sun Air, and a hotel and food group.
</P>
<P>
Among the sub-regions in the continent, the report said, North
Africa continued to receive increased investment inflows, raising
its shares in total FDI inflows to Africa from 29 percent in 1996
to 39 percent in 1997, while flows into Sub-Saharan Africa were
an estimated 2.9 billion Dollars in 1997, down from 3.3 billion
Dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that 1997 was the fourth consecutive year
of economic growth in Africa as a whole and GDP growth rates
exceeded five percent in several countries.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that privatization has become increasingly
important for attracting FDI, although it is far from being fully
explored by most African countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, African countries are strengthening
efforts to enhance policy frameworks, making them attractive to
foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, some 47 of the 53 countries in the region had adopted
national laws governing FDI. Progress has also been noted in
improvements in institutions, openness to trade and strengthening
of the telecommunications infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Investment promotion agencies are proliferating and awareness
is rising in African governments of the need to strengthen the
overall investment environment by reducing bureaucratic red tape
and curbing corruption.

</P>
<P>
The prince said in his earlier letter to his father King
Norodom Sihanouk that he agreed to return to the country to join a
summit meeting with Second Prime Minister Hun Sen which is chaired
by the King in Royal Palace.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh decided to return after he obtained the security
assurance from the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) and Second Prime
Minister Hun Sen.
</P>
<P>
The prince had left the country for nearly seven weeks,
claiming there was no personal safety in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that leaders of the two parties will meet
Thursday evening and Friday under the chair of the King in Royal
Palace. The King will leave here Saturday for Beijing for medical
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Sam Rainsy, another opposition leader of his self-named party,
will not participate in Thursday's summit, because he is in Paris
now.
</P>
<P>
A flurry of political activity has been made this week to
arrange talks before the ailing monarch leaves for Beijing
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 76-year-old monarch has offered to mediate between Hun Sen,
deposed first prime minister Prince Ranariddh and opposition
co-leader Sam Rainsy.
</P>
<P>
The CPP, FUNCINPEC and Sam Rainsy Party (SRP), the three
leading parties in the National Assembly after the July elections,
have been unable to form a new government since.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh, Sam Rainsy and more than 30 other lawmakers
went abroad after the parliament was sworn in six weeks ago,
saying they feared their security in the country, and accusing Hun
Sen of winning the election through fraud and intimidation.
</P>
<P>
Distrust runs deep between the CPP and FUNCINPEC, who are
former battlefield enemies in Cambodia's four-way civil war during
the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Their coalition government following the 1993 election
collapsed last year after troops loyal to Hun Sen effectively
ousted the prince as co-premier.
</P>
<P>
The three parties have already held one summit and three rounds
of working group meetings but failed to make significant progress.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Turkish newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Hurriyet (Freedom):
</P>
<P>
-- Republican People's Party Chairman Deniz Baykal Wednesday
urged Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz to resign, saying his
party may withdraw its support to the coalition government in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Two major opposition parties, the pro-Islamic Virtue Party
and the True Path Party, lodged a non-confidence motion against
the Yilmaz government, accusing the prime minister of interfering
in business activities of a bank and being related to mafia.
</P>
<P>
Sabah (Morning):
</P>
<P>
-- Before winding up his five-day visit in Ankara Wednesday,
Iraq's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan leader Jalal Talabani pledged
to help Turkey fight the militants of Turkey's outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK).
</P>
<P>
Turkey has repeatedly accused the pro-Iranian PUK of
sheltering the PKK in northern Iraq who launches cross-border
attacks on military and civilian targets in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Milliyet (National):
</P>
<P>
-- Turkish Cypriot authorities issued a written statement
Wednesday slamming the European Union (EU) for officially starting
membership negotiations with Cyprus, warning that the EU's
decision might lead to "a permanent division of the island state."
</P>
<P>
(Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
troops and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a pro-Athens coup.)

<HEADLINE> Share Prices Fall Sharply in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices fell sharply
Thursday in Tokyo as market players were disappointed at
government's new stimulus package, which failed to offer new steps
to revive the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange lost 352.96 points, or 2.45
percent, to 14,075.06 at close, more than wiping away Wednesday's
320-point gains.
</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues, dropped 15.19 points or 1.38 percent to
1,082.93.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section grew to an estimated 404 million
shares from Wednesday's 386.55 million shares.
</P>
<P>
Sakura Bank was the day's volume leader.
</P>
<P>
Traders were not surprised by Thursday's plunge, noting that
Wednesday's sharp, unexpected advance was provoked by
arbitrage-related buying among Japanese brokerages.
</P>
<P>
The government's plan for various income tax cuts is not bad,
but these have already been factored into the market, said a
dealer, adding that the market lacks the foundation to make a
really strong jump upward.
</P>
<P>
Export-heavy shares which enjoyed large gains Wednesday fell
hard on profit-taking.
</P>
<P>
Of the 1,345 issues listed on the First Section, losers
surpassed gainers 778 to 361, with 139 issues ending unchanged.

HEFEI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province has
increased funding for urban infrastructure in order to increase
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
The province allocated over 2.34 billion yuan for the
construction of infrastructure facilities during the first three
quarters of this year. Total funding for the year is expected to
reach four billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official noted that funds have mainly been
earmarked for the construction of roads, bridges and sewage
discharge and treatment plants, as well as in environmental
protection projects.

Some 32-odd projects supported by the central government and 72
projects using local fiscal funds have been implemented during

</P>
<P>
Anhui has introduced use fees for various urban facilities as

<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministry Spokesman Zhu
Bangzao told a press conference here this afternoon that China
will continue to work toward a peaceful resolution to the current
weapons inspection confrontation in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that there is a danger of losing control and that the
Chinese government is deeply concerned about that.
</P>
<P>
"We have always held that problems arising during the weapons
inspection in Iraq should be handled through political and
diplomatic means, and we oppose the use of force," Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that Iraq should cooperate with the UN completely,
by strictly implementing the Security Council resolutions, and by
honoring its obligations," he went on to say, and that China has
repeatedly stated this to parties concerned including Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that this morning, Assistant Foreign Minister Wang
Guangya met with Iraq's Ambassador Bassam Salih Kubba and
delivered a letter from Vice-Premier Qian Qichen to Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz in the hope that Iraq can resume
cooperation with the UN as soon as possible to avoid a further
deterioration of the situation.

<HEADLINE> Sale of Kenya's Leading Insurance Company Put off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The sale of the Kenya
Reinsurance Corporation (Kenya-Re) through the Nairobi Stock
Exchange (NSE) has been delayed by a long search for strategic
investors and a battled economy, financial analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The government's Parastatal Reform Program Committee (PRPC)
said the sale was now anticipated in January next year, instead
of between October 29 and December 11 this year as earlier
planned.
</P>
<P>
PRPC offered no reasons for the delay, said a report from the
East African Standard newspaper Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, veteran financial analysts said that Kenya's
recreating economy, which has led to a major decline in share
values on the Nairobi bourse, was a motivating factor.
</P>
<P>
The Central Bank of Kenya has forecast gross domestic product
(GDP) growth will fall to 1.6 percent in 1998 from 2.3 percent in
1997. It expects moderate gains in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"It is felt that there will be less sufficient local interest
in view of current economic turmoil. A date next year would
appear more suitable, when the recovery of stocks is
anticipated," said a managing director at a brokerage house.
</P>
<P>
The NSE 20-share index stood at 2636.32 points Wednesday,
still hovering at four-and-half-year lows.
</P>
<P>
Under the Kenya-Re privatization plans, the government will
offload 49 percent of its stake. An initial sale of 24 percent
targets strategic partners -- four bidders, three international
reinsurance firms and a consortium of locals, are shortlisted.
</P>
<P>
A further 24 percent will be sold on the Nairobi bourse.
Kenya-Re staff will get one percent of their firm.
</P>
<P>
Kenya-Re's net worth is 3.5 billion Shillings (58.8 million
U.S. Dollars).

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economists Focus on Economic Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Economic stability, financial
risk and unemployment have emerged as three major topics under
discussion by Chinese economists.
</P>
<P>
The 1998 Report on China's Frontier Social Sciences, the first
of its kind compiled by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences,
lists microeconomic stability as the major issue cared by
economists.
</P>
<P>
The report notes that continuing macroeconomic stability will
promote development of the market economy and vice versa.
</P>
<P>
It also points out that China's ample foreign exchange reserves
and unconvertible capital accounts provide protection against the
immediate affects of overseas financial crisis. However, according
to the report, the unhealthy situation involving the substantial
debt enterprises owe banks creates a potential risk which could
possibly ignite a crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report cites the "urgent" need to research the causes,
mechanisms, and influences of financial risk, as well as effective
preventative measures.
</P>
<P>
Chinese economists are also greatly concerned about
unemployment, which they note is a serious practical issue, as
well as a theoretical issue. They also point out the need to
develop statistics to provide necessary information for
policy-making and research, and noted that greater emphasis should
be placed on theoretical research.
</P>
<P>
The report also lists a number of major microeconomic issues,
including the research of property rights theory, the shareholding
system and the reform of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Three-Way Partnership Tackles Madagascar's Rural </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Rice Research
Institute (IRRI), the U.S. Agency for International Development
and the Madagascar government have joined force to address
Madagascar's rural poverty, environmental and agricultural
problems, IRRI said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here, IRRI said that the project will
aim at conserving Madagascar's very diverse agricultural
environment and reduce rural poverty through increasing the
development and appropriate technologies.
</P>
<P>
From 1998 to 2001, it said, IRRI's work will focus on the
non-irrigated, rainfed lowland environment, which occupies 75
percent of the rice-growing area of Madagascar.
</P>
<P>
IRRI said that its activities will include integrated pest
management, crop intensification and diversification, improvement
of rice varieties, and agricultural engineering research.
</P>
<P>
Madagascar is the second largest rice producer in the
Africa-Indian Ocean region, topped only by Egypt.
</P>
<P>
But the Indian Ocean island state is known for its high rate of
environmental degradation. Between 200,000 and 300,000 hectares of
natural forests are cut annually and topsoil losses are estimated
at 150-200 tons per hectare per year.
</P>
<P>
IRRI, with its headquarters in Los Bafios, the Philippines, is
the world's leading international rice research and training
center. Its goal is to improve the well-being of present and
future generations of rice farmers and consumers.

<HEADLINE> Australia Provides Export Credits for 4 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Australia announced Thursday
export credit insurance for about four million tons of Australian
wheat, and a four month extension for short term credit insurance
for exports to South Korea and Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer said the insurance cover
would be underwritten from the government-controlled Export
Finance Insurance Corporation's (EFIC) National Interest Account.
</P>
<P>
"Australia is facing a potential record wheat crop this year,
and the government through its decision to provide continued
access for the wheat industry to credit insurance facilities, is
showing a strong commitment to Australian export and jobs,"
Fischer said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
"This insurance is not a government gift or subsidy to
Australian growers. National Interest cover is offered to
Australian growers on commercial terms and conditions and include
the payment of a premium, just like any other commercial insurance
cover," said Fischer, who is also deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
Fischer said the four-month insurance extension for exports to
South Korea and Indonesia would help exporters maintain their
export trade during the difficult economic times in those
countries.
</P>
<P>
He said in the case of South Korea, the insurance would involve
maintenance of the current level of up to 500 million Australian
dollars (300 million U.S. dollars) of cover.
</P>
<P>
"The Indonesian arrangement will continue to provide for case
by case consideration of requests for cover," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
Manila, November 12 (Xinhua) -- To help save children from
becoming casualties caused by La Nina's typhoons and floods, the
Philippine government has directed elementary and high schools to
include this phenomena and its effects in their lessons.
</P>
<P>
Andrew Gonzalez, secretary of education, culture and sports,
said in a report that the schools were integrating these concerns
in subjects like science, English, Filipino, social studies, music
and arts to teach students precautionary and safety measures
during disasters.
</P>
<P>
As a complementary move, Gonzalez also reactivated the Disaster
Coordination Committee to take charge of assisting students when
the natural calamities strike.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, schools were urged to tap student clubs or
organizations to act as emergency brigades.
</P>
<P>
Unlike El Nino which causes prolonged droughts or dry spells,
La Nina is associated with strong winds, heavy rains and massive
flooding.

<HEADLINE> Global Semiconductors Market to Rise in Coming Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The worldwide annual
market value for semiconductors will increase about 50 percent to
182 billion U.S. dollars in the next three years,
U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Silicon Valley-based association, which represents the
computer chip industry, projected that the semiconductor market in
1998 will total 122 billion dollars, off 11 percent from last
year.
</P>
<P>
However, it said, the sales will rise 9.1 percent to 133.4
billion dollars in 1999, 15.2 percent to 151.6 billion dollars in
2000, and 18.2 percent to 182 billion dollars in 2001.
</P>
<P>
The association, which releases industry forecasts
twice a year, cited several factors for this year's decline in
sales.
</P>
<P>
Firstly, the Asian economic crisis has hit the industry hard,
bringing the Asia-Pacific semiconductor market down 8.1 percent to
27.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that some computer companies built up too
much inventory and sold computers with older chips this year.
</P>
<P>
However, the association said the Asia-Pacific market will
recover during the next three years. By 2001, sales there are
expected to surpass Europe, making it the second-strongest region,
after North America, with revenue amounting to 43.9 billion
dollars, the association said in its annual global forecast.
</P>
<P>
Computer companies are now ready to buy new chips for new
computers, it added.
</P>
<P>
The memory chip market, which has seen prices plunge since
early 1996 because of overcapacity, should hit bottom this year as
sales fall by 25.7 percent to 21.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The market is forecast to bounce back 18.1 percent in 1999 to
25.8 billion dollars, surge 23 percent in 2000 to 31.6 billion
dollars, and 28 percent in 2001 to 40.5 billion dollars, the
association said.

DALIAN, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Bohai No. 4, China's largest

The platform was built in 1977 by Japan's Hitachi Shipyard for
China Offshore Oil Corporation's North Petroleum Drilling Company.
</P>
<P>
The new shipyard plant beat out four other major shipyards in
Japan, Singapore, and Hong Kong in the bidding because it could do
the work three months quicker.

According to one engineer, 75 percent of the platform will be
rebuilt. The new plant signed the contract with North Petroleum on
Tuesday.
</P>

The work will cost 9 million U.S. dollars, which is more than
all other income the new plant got from ship repairs in 1997.

BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Beijing has launched a series
of road improvement projects to ease traffic jams on the Second
and Third ring roads in the downtown area.
</P>
<P>
Major improvement measures for the Second (33 km) and Third (48
km) ring roads will include the installation of a traffic control
monitoring system, reducing the number of access roads, narrowing
the width of lanes, and adding an emergency parking lane and a
service road on both sides of the ring roads.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Mayor Wang Guangtao said that 10 major routes linked to
the ring roads will be transformed into expressways, 13 overpasses
will be added and 22 additional feeder roads will be improved or
widened in areas between the ring roads.
</P>
<P>
New express lanes for buses will be linked to the existing city
network.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the project will be completed by the end of July 1999
and will raise the average speed of vehicles by as much as 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
The two ring roads were built in the late 1970s when there were
400,000 motor vehicles in the Chinese capital. The number of motor
vehicles has increased to more than 1.3 million at present.

<HEADLINE> Non-Public Sectors Play Greater Role in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China's largest industrial
city of Shanghai has witnessed increasing role of sectors other
than public owned economy in the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
According to the local statistics bureau, non-public sectors
contributed to 22.9 percent to the city's GDP in 1997, up from
only one percent in 1978, the year when China started the reform
and opening up efforts.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, publicly owned companies accounted for 77.1
percent of the city's GDP in 1997, dropping from 99 percent 20
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Public owned economy remains the predominant force in the
country's economic growth. The proportions of added value of
public owned economy stand at 42.6 percent for industry, 67.7
percent for commerce, 85.5 percent for financial and insurance,
and 87.3 percent for communications and postal service sector.
</P>
<P>
Figures for collectively owned economy in industrial,
construction, commercial, agricultural and transportation sectors
are 30.2 percent, 34.6 percent, 12.8 percent, 11.6 percent and 8.7
percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Non-public economy plays a greater role in real estate sector,
trade and catering industries.
</P>
<P>
The new distribution of ownership is expected to benefit
industrial restructuring. In the past two decades, more than 1.6
million workers in Shanghai have shifted from primary industries
to other sectors, boosting production efficiency by a big margin.

<HEADLINE> China Reaffirms Logging Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China's Foresty Administration
Director Wang Zhibao today reaffirmed China's logging ban in the
Yangtze and Yellow River valleys.
</P>
<P>
Wang said the goal of the ban is to promote soil and water
conservation and will serve as a prelude to massive construction
of water conservation facilities along other rivers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the logging ban includes two specific
applications, with the first involving the imposition of strict
bans and the other featuring a grace period and the gradual
reduction of related activities.
</P>
<P>
The ban is expected to reduce China's timber output by 15
million cu.m. by the year 2000, according to wang.
</P>
<P>
Logging companies affected by the ban are supposed to
restructure business activities to include forestry conservation
and construction.
</P>
<P>
Wang said China will ensure the success of the program by
closing timber markets in zones subject to the ban, confiscate
logging machinery and equipment and close heavily forested
mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
He urged logging companies to provided for the needs of
workers laid-off during restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
China banned logging on the upper reaches of major rivers
following devastating summer flooding in the Yangtze River
Valley. Increased forest coverage is expected to reduce damage
resulting from annual flooding, according to Wang.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Vegetables have replaced
cotton as the leading money making crop in China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
The province had 600,000 hectares of vegetables last year, 80
percent of them in rural areas, the first time for land planted in
vegetables to exceed that in cotton.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu harvested more than 18 million tons of vegetables in
1997, 6.3 times more than the 1979 figure, and earned 11.3 billion
yuan from sales, 44 times more than the 1979 figure. The year 1979
is the watershed year from which China initiated its reform and
opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
The province now has 10 counties with more than 20,000 hectares
of vegetables each and two with more than 33,000 hectares each.
</P>
<P>
A number of special vegetable export bases have sprung up in
the province, with the emergence of processing enterprises. The
province processed as many as 100,000 tons of vegetables for
export last year.

<HEADLINE> Township Enterprises Help ease unemployment burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Township and village
enterprises have turned more than a third of the rural workforce
in China's Zhejiang Province into industrial workers in the past
two decades.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show 930,000 enterprises in rural Zhejiang
employing 7.86 million farmers. In some areas, in the cities of
Hangzhou, Ningbo and Taizhou, over 60 percent of the surplus rural
laborers are working in township enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Township and village enterprises came into being in the early
1980s in Zhejiang and now account for four-fifths of Zhejiang's
total industrial output.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the growth in rural enterprises has helped
ease burden of unemployment on the government by providing jobs for
surplus laborers.
</P>
<P>
To improve the quality of these farmer-turned workers, the
provincial government has started a vocational training program,
setting up several special training centers and colleges. About
700,000 workers have gone through the technical training program
since 1990.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh FM Visits Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh foreign minister
Abdus Samad Azad is now currently on a three-day visit to Myanmar
aimed at strengthening bilateral ties and economic cooperation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Azad, who arrived here Wednesday, will hold talks Thursday with
his Myanmar counterpart U Ohn Gyaw on bilateral issues, including
those concerning Myanmar refugees in Bangladesh and the border
issue.
</P>
<P>
It is Azad's second visit to Yangon since September 1996.
</P>
<P>
During Azad's first trip to Myanmar, the two countries agreed
to complete the repatriation of the Myanmar refugees from
Bangladesh at an early date.
</P>
<P>
The two foreign ministers then noted that there were no serious
problems existing between the two countries, adding that even if
there was a problem, a solution would be found based on mutual
respect, trust and friendship.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, U Ohn Gyaw visited Bangladesh and the two
ministers discussed the repatriation of Myanmar refugees, border
trade and cooperation in joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, a total of 250,000 Myanmar Muslim refugees fled across
the border into Bangladesh from Western Rakhine state, and 228,000
of them have already been reportedly repatriated under the joint
supervision of the Bangladeshi and Myanmar governments and the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
</P>
<P>
The repatriation process, which began in September 1992
following an agreement reached between the two sides in April that
year, has remained stalled since July 1997 reportedly as a result
of the refugees' refusal to return.
</P>
<P>
In July this year, Bangladesh and Myanmar signed in Dhaka a
memorandum of understanding to promote and expand trade,
investment and other economic activities between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade stands at about 8 million U.S. dollars a year,
according to Commerce and Industries Minister of Bangladesh Tofail
Ahmed.
</P>
<P>
The two countries formally opened border trade in September
1995.

<HEADLINE> Romania, Bulgaria Pledge to Strengthen Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Romania and Bulgaria on
Wednesday agreed to strengthen cooperation for a faster reform
process to prepare themselves for memberships of NATO and the
European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Romanian President Emil Constantinescu and his Bulgarian
counterpart Petar Stoyanov, who arrived here Tuesday for a two-day
official visit, made a statement after their final round of talks
here.
</P>
<P>
They said the two sides should make full use of the "very good"
political ties between them to boost bilateral trade
and economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
On joining the EU and NATO, they stressed that the
two countries should establish a relationship of cooperation and
mutual support rather than that of adversaries.
</P>
<P>
In addition to challenges common to other Central and Eastern
European countries in joining the two blocs, Romania and Bulgaria
would have to work on their own to overcome negative impacts from
years of crisis of the former Yugoslavia, the presidents said.
</P>
<P>
They said their countries, neighbors of Yugoslavia, suffered
heavily from international sanctions against Belgrade in the last
few years, while the regional turmoil caused by the latest Kosovo
crisis was holding back many potential foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
Stoyanov held several rounds of talks with Constantinescu and
met Prime Minister Radu Vasile as well as top Romanian legislators
during his first visit to Romania as president of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
In the past two days, the two countries signed five agreements
on closer bilateral cooperation in the fields of science and
technology, culture, transportation, agriculture and customs
service.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian to Take Strong Measures Against Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's petroleum
smuggling has become a serious problem which is costing the
government 800,000 U.S. dollars a month in lost revenue, according
to Finance Minister Keat Chhon.
</P>
<P>
"We will take tougher measures to curb this and all kinds of
smuggling," Keat Chhon was quoted Thursday by the Cambodia Daily
as saying.
</P>
<P>
However, the finance minister and other officials did not
specify what measures the government would take.
</P>
<P>
Another meeting has been scheduled to discuss specific measures
that can be taken against smuggling and other "illnesses of
society," such as illegal logging.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, smugglers have been bringing about 10
truckloads of fuel a month into Cambodia through the former
guerrilla zones of Pailin and Sampoeu Luon, according to Kim
Nguon, deputy chief of ports.
</P>
<P>
"Gas smuggling is customs' biggest problem and our biggest loss
of revenue," said Kim Nguon.
</P>
<P>
Customs officials said Pailin has attracted unscrupulous
businessmen because of the tax-free status granted to the former
Khmer Rouge stronghold in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Customs revenues are a vital source of revenue for the
government, accounting for more than half of all government
revenues. Petroleum accounts for about 75 percent of customs
duties.
</P>
<P>
Late last month Second Prime Minister Hun Sen issued a
seven-point plan aimed at combating "smuggling in any form."
</P>
<P>
Whether the latest move against smuggling will succeed remains
to be seen. Previous efforts by the government to stop gasoline
smuggling have yielded little results.
</P>
<P>
Keat Chhon said every level of authority, including the
military, has promised cooperation in the fight against smuggling.

<HEADLINE> China to Increase Use of Machines for Drying Grain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China will increase the use of
machines for drying grain at production bases in a bid to put an
end to enormous losses caused by lack of the machinery.
</P>
<P>
China now has 20,000 crop drying machines, most of them being
used to dry sideline or special products instead of grain. Yet the
country loses an average of five billion kg of grain annually
because it is not dried on in time. So, drying grain at production
centers immediately is considered an urgent task.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture will experiment with machines in
drying grain in 12 places in 12 provinces this autumn and next
summer, and will use them in more areas if they prove successful.
</P>
<P>
The development of medium-sized and small grain drying
equipment has been put in the list of key state projects for the
country's current five-year plan period ending in 2000.

BEIJING, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China's domestic market will
mainly meet the increasing demand for timber and related products,
according to Wang Zhibao, director of the State Forestry

Wang noted that China, a country with over 1.2 billion people,

<P>
China leads the world with afforestation projects completed on

</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, the nation's 13.92 percent forest coverage lags

<HEADLINE> NZ Students Face Tightened Loan Terms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Education
Minister Wyatt Creech has announced that student loans will no
longer be available in lump sums and students under 18 years old
will need parents' consent when they want to borrow from the
loans scheme.
</P>
<P>
The changes to the student loans scheme are aimed at ensuring
the money will be used for education and nothing else, the
Evening Post Thursday quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The changes are designed to make the scheme fairer, reduce the
debt burden on students, reduce the time they spend repaying loans
and reduce abuse of the scheme," Creech said.
</P>
<P>
They would put an end to "young people getting ready access to
large sums to pay for things like overseas trips and motorbikes,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Wellington-based newspaper, the tightening of
student loan terms will reduce student debt by 4.2 billion NZ
dollars (2.2 billion U.S. dollars) by 2024, a 22.5 percent drop in
the forecast level.
</P>
<P>
But the changes have met with opposition from students. Some of
them said the changes would push students "below the
poverty-line."
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, the total outstanding student
debt, now more than 2.4 billion NZ dollars (1.27 billion U.S.
dollars), will top three billion next year and four billion by
2001.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Armed ethnic Albanians
launched four attacks on Serbian soldiers and peasants on Tuesday
and Wednesday, the Tanjug news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
A group of armed ethnic Albanians Wednesday morning fired from
the woods at a Serbian peasant and three gypsy peasants working in
the fields in Grabac village of Klina area. The peasants survived
as a Serbian police car rushed to the scene on reports of the
attack.
</P>
<P>
In the afternoon, another group of ethnic Albanians ambushed a
Yugoslav military vehicle passing through Grebnik village in the
same area. The ethnic Albanians withdrew after soldiers in the
vehicle fought back.
</P>
<P>
About 10 pm on Tuesday, the rebels launched a mortar attack on
Kijevo village in Klina.
</P>
<P>
Two hours later, three Serbian policemen in Glogovac station
were seriously injured in fightings with some ethnic Albanians who
raided the station with mortars, grenades and riffles, according
to the Pristina Media Center.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports here, attacks launched by armed
ethnic Albanians on Serbian residents and police stations have
never stopped since Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic reached
an agreement with U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke on a peaceful
solution to the Kosovo crisis on October 13. However, no
large-scale clashes have been reported since then.

BUDAPEST, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Foreign investment in central
and eastern Europe in 1998 are expected to reach up to 20 billion
U.S. dollars, maintaining the level of last year.
</P>
<P>
Kalotay Kalman, investment adviser of the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), said the Asian and
Russian economic crises had failed to seriously affect the
region's economy.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment in Poland, Hungary, Czech and other central

<P>
By August, foreign investment in Hungary amounted to 1.25
billion dollars and was expected to rise to two billion dollars by
the end of this year, he added.
</P>
<P>
Capital circulating globally is estimated to rise to 400 to 440
billion dollars by the end of 1998, or by 10 percent over 1997,
mainly thanks to the mergers of multi-national corporations and
the growth in the number of their branches.

<HEADLINE> Compaq to Sell PCs Directly to Customers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Compaq Computer
Corp., the world's biggest personal computer maker, said Wednesday
it would sell a new line of desk-top computers directly to
customers, bypassing its distributors.
</P>
<P>
Compaq has already begun to offer PCs directly to large
businesses and consumers, but most customers still buy the
company's PCs indirectly through distributors and retailers. The
company said it would pay a commission to dealers who refer their
customers to Compaq.
</P>
<P>
The shift, according to reports from the company, takes aim at
Dell Computer Corp. and other PC makers that sell products
directly to consumers and businesses.
</P>
<P>
"We are implementing a new business model, called 'Customer
Choice,'" Compaq chief executive Eckhard Pfeiffer said at a news
conference.
</P>
<P>
He said Compaq was ready to ship direct-ordered PCs within five
business days, on average, on par with rivals and far faster than
the three weeks now needed for purchases from distributors.
</P>
<P>
The motivation for targeting the small and medium business
market -- some 7.2 million U.S. businesses that employ fewer than
500 workers each -- is its projected growth of 20 percent this
year, nearly twice the rate of the overall PC market.
</P>
<P>
Compaq's effort to expand its share of the small business
market also aims to encourage these customers away from local
resellers who buy low-cost chips to assemble no-name PCs, a market
known as the "white box" business.

SHANGHAI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- China's leading industrial
and financial center Shanghai has put 109.7 billion yuan into
fixed assets so far this year.
</P>
<P>
That brings the city's total fixed assets investment for the
two decades since 1979, a period of rapid growth during economic
reforms, to 1.05 trillion yuan, 30 times the combined investment
between 1949 when the country was founded and 1978 when reform
began, a municipal official says.
</P>
<P>
Of that amount, 300 billion yuan was used for the city's six
pillar industries, as well as the development of information
technology, new materials, and high technology.
</P>
<P>
The government spent billions of yuan on residential housing,
roads and bridges, museums, theatres, and sports facilities.
</P>
<P>
The average per capita living space in urban districts has
climbed to 9.3 square meters and the percentage of people using
gas in their homes to 90.

<P>
In 1978, there was no building more than 30 stories high in
Shanghai, but now, the Lujiazui finance and trade zone alone has

<HEADLINE> Thailand Supports Call for Control on Hedge Funds </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Thailand Wednesday underlined
its support for a proposal for Asia-Pacific leaders to call on
industrial countries to assert more control over their lending
operations and hedge funds, according to the Thai Foreign
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry spokesman Kobsak Chutikul said the proposal
forms part of a report from finance ministers of the Asia-Pacific
Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum to their leaders meeting in
Kuala Lumpur next week.
</P>
<P>
The report is to be the basis of the debate on the financial
crisis that Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai is leading on
November 18 at the sixth APEC leadership meeting.
</P>
<P>
Kobsak was quoted Thursday by the Bangkok Post as saying that
the report proposes that APEC call on industrialized countries to
ensure that their financial institutions are more transparent in
lending, and accurate in risk assessment.
</P>
<P>
The report also urges transparency in the workings of hedge
funds.
</P>
<P>
The report further calls for the setting up of an international
working group to work out debt arrangements with private sectors,
the strengthening of the international financial architecture, and
immediate attention to minimizing the social impact of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The report emphasizes that strong financial systems at
international and national levels are crucial to APEC's goal of
liberalization, Kobsak said.
</P>
<P>
"Asia's financial crisis has revealed the problem of weak
financial infrastructure in the region which impedes the APEC goal
of trade liberalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
The involvement of the private sector in strengthening the
infrastructure is crucial to preventing the recurrence of such a
crisis in future, he added.

PRAGUE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Direct foreign investments in
the central-east European countries in 1997 hit a record high of

<P>
Romania registered the biggest increase in direct foreign
investments, from getting 270 million dollars in 1996 to 1.22
billion in 1997.

However, foreign investments to the Czech Republic and Croatia
fell, with the former attracting 1.3 billion dollars in 1997

<HEADLINE> Albanian City Returns to Normal After Unrest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Albania's northern city of
Shkoder returned to normal on Wednesday after a one-day unrest
triggered off by the arrest of a wanted fugitive.
</P>
<P>
According to the Albanian Telegraphic Agency, Shkoder police
Tuesday arrested wanted criminal Marjan Gryke and two other
accomplices.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of gunmen reacted to the arrests by blocking the city
road to provincial government, shooting into the air and setting
fire to the office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) in the city.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city's anti-communists association said in a
televised statement that the arrests were politically motivated
and asked for the release of the three fugitives.
</P>
<P>
To prevent things from turning worse, the government sent
special forces to the city. As a result, police regained the
control of the city in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Later in the day, provincial leaders explained to some
organization representatives that the suspects were arrested not
out of political reasons but for the serious crimes they had
committed.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Rice Harvest May be Hit By La Nina </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The La Nina weather phenomenon
may cut rice production in Indonesia's 10 provinces as excessive
rains induced by an unusual cool climate could delay or affect
rice harvests in the areas next year, a government official said.
</P>
<P>
The delays in planting and damage to rice fields could
significantly cut rice production in the 10 provinces, Director
General of Food Crops and Horticulture at the Ministry of
Agriculture Chairil Anwar Rasahan told reporters on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The provinces are Aceh, North and South Sumatra, Lampung, West,
Central and East Java, West and East Kalimantan and South
Sulawesi.
</P>
<P>
"We must be mindful because rice production in those provinces
(usually) accounts for 50 percent of the country's total rice
output," Chairil said, adding that La Nina could begin this month
and could last until early next year.
</P>
<P>
La Nina, which means "little sister," arises from unusually
cool temperatures in the Pacific Ocean and often follows the
drought-inducing El Nino weather pattern. Its arrival brings about
the threat of floods, violent tropical storms and landslides.
</P>
<P>
During the El Nino cycle last year, Indonesia experienced its
most severe drought in 50 years. Forest fires burned uncontrolled
on Sumatra and Kalimantan, and the country's agricultural
production was seriously affected.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's unhusked rice production is expected to drop by
5.94 percent this year to 46.44 million tons from 49.3 million
tons in 1997, due to harvest failure caused by prolonged drought.
</P>
<P>
The country was forced to import 4.1 million tons of rice this
fiscal year ending March 1999 to meet the supply shortage at home.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture and other relevant government
agencies would immediately begin to draft contingency plans to
address the affects of severe weather, Chairil was quoted by the
Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Give Privileges to Outstanding Exporters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Myanmar Ministry of
Commerce is planning to grant special privileges to local and
foreign entrepreneurs who earn the highest amount of foreign
exchange through export in the 1997-98 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The official New Light of Myanmar newspaper quoted a news
bulletin of the ministry as saying that the ministry will select
10 domestic companies and 10 foreign ones which exported goods
worth 2 million U.S. dollars and above through seaborne trade in
the fiscal year and grant them the privileges.
</P>
<P>
But it gave no details of the special privileges.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as one of Myanmar's measures to promote
private trading and economic development of the country in its
efforts to reduce the impact of the prolonged Asian financial
crisis which started in July last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry is also planning to issue export and
import licenses within 48 hours instead of one week to a month to
exporters and importers in the country to facilitate their trade
activities.
</P>
<P>
According to the ministry's figures, the private sector's
export and import have been considerably boosted with its share of
exports jumping from 46.3 percent in the fiscal 1988-89, when the
country started adopting the market-oriented economic system, to
67.8 percent in the fiscal 1997-98. Meanwhile, its share of
imports rose from 40.7 percent to 71.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The country's foreign trade, including the border trade, rose
sharply in the first half of this year compared with the same
period of last year, reaching 1.898 billion dollars, an increase
of 28.8 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senator Suggests Halt to Impeachment Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senator Arlen Specter
on Wednesday suggested that Congress halt the impeachment inquiry
and leave President Bill Clinton to the criminal justice system
after his term ends. But Representative Henry Hyde, leader of the
probe, rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Specter told reporters he has shared his idea with Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott and the likely House speaker in the
next Congress, Bob Livingston. Both were noncommittal, Specter
said.
</P>
<P>
Specter said that he would discuss his idea with Hyde, the
House Judiciary Committee Chairman.
</P>
<P>
Hyde said in Wheaton, Illinois, that hearings scheduled for
November 19 would go on, as would subsequent committee
deliberations on articles of impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"Senator Specter's always ahead of the curve. But he'll get
his chance to express himself authoritatively, ultimately, I
suspect," the Associated Press quoted Hyde as saying.
</P>
<P>
Articles of impeachment, similar to an indictment, would become
a matter for the Senate if approved by the full House by majority
vote. If the Senate conducts a trial, a two-third vote would be
needed for conviction -- considered unlikely with just a 55-45
Republican majority.
</P>
<P>
The 21 Republicans on Hyde's committee are mostly staunch
conservatives, who intensified attacks this week on those who
believe that lying about a sexual affair -- even under oath --
does not merit impeachment.
</P>
<P>
"I think we have a constitutional duty to perform under the law
and the Constitution, and we're going to perform it. I don't know
how it's going to come out. I haven't counted noses, I can't
predict the end result, but I will predict we will press forward
and do our duty," Hyde said in response to Specter's idea.
</P>
<P>
Specter, a former prosecutor, said some Republicans were
"searching for a way out" of an unpopular impeachment effort but
acknowledged his idea "is going to take some ... digestion." The
dialogue must begin now, Specter said, because the Senate won't
convict Clinton.
</P>
<P>
"I am suggesting holding the president accountable through the
criminal process after his term of office expires, where he could
be subject to prosecution for perjury, obstruction of justice and
face the distinct possibility of a jail sentence, as contrasted
with the impeachment proceedings, which I believe will come to
naught," Specter told a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Specter said any possibility of a criminal conviction "would
really evaporate if the House does not return articles but
considers it, or if the Senate were to find the president not
guilty."

<HEADLINE> Former State Lawmaker Runs for Gingrich's Georgia Seat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Former Republican
legislator and two-time statewide candidate Johnny Isakson joined
the race on Wednesday for Newt Gingrich's House seat representing
Georgia.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich said in a statement on Tuesday that he hoped Isakson,
the state school board chairman, would run.
</P>
<P>
"Speaker Gingrich and I have a little in common," Isakson was
quoted as telling a group of supporters.
</P>
<P>
"We started in politics in Georgia at the same time ... and we
were Republican when Republican wasn't cool."
</P>
<P>
The best known Democrat considering the race is Great American
Cookie Co. founder Michael Coles, who lost a Senate bid last week
and lost to Gingrich in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Gingrich decided to leave the House after a disappointing
Republican showing in last week's midterm elections. After he
sets a resignation date, Georgia's governor will schedule a
special election, expected to be a nonpartisan race early next
year.

<HEADLINE> Fewer Fires in Shanghai in Ten-Month Period </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai has had fewer major
fires this year, thanks to more stringent fire prevention
measures, according to Metropolitan Guide newspaper.
</P>
<P>
In the January-October period, there were 5,760 fires in
Shanghai, which killed 33 people and injured 102, and caused 19.09
million yuan in damage.
</P>
<P>
These figures are all down markedly from the same period last
year, Li Tieshan, director of the city's fire control
office, was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The reduction in the number of fires was the result of tougher
measures in the Fire-control Law in businesses, warehouses, and
schools, the official said.

<HEADLINE> Italy Urges Diplomacy in Iraq Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Amid growing indications that a
United State-led attack on Iraq is imminent, Italian Foreign
Minister Lamberto Dini said Wednesday there was still room for
diplomacy in the dispute over U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
As more U.S. planes and troops headed for the Gulf and
President Bill Clinton warned that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
"must not have the illusion of immunity", Dini said Italy and its
allies would continue to work for a non-violent solution.
</P>
<P>
"We have been in constant contact with our principle partners
since the start of the crisis, and those contacts don't lead us to
believe that diplomatic efforts can be considered at an end," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, in what many saw as an ominous sign, United Nations
Secretary-General Kofi Annan cut short a visit to Morocco to head
back to New York, where a Security Council meeting has been called
for Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he had sent a message to Annan and Iraqi Deputy Prime
Minister Tareq Aziz, expressing Italy's "profound concern" over the
deterioration of the situation following Baghdad's refusal to
continue to submit to inspections.
</P>
<P>
He said Rome did not want a military solution to the crisis.
"This would have grave consequences for Iraq's civilian population
and for the entire region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Signs of disapproval for U.S. military action in the Gulf also
came from Germany Wednesday. German Foreign Minister Joschka
Fischer said in an interview with the weekly Zeit: "Missiles won't
end Saddam's dictatorship and they won't stop him producing arms
of mass destruction."
</P>
<P>
Dini confirmed his view that it was time to place a limit on
the duration of the Iraqi weapons inspections and the embargo it
has suffered since the Gulf War of 1991.
</P>
<P>
The idea of a comprehensive review of the Iraqi situation --
aimed at the lifting of sanctions if Baghdad fulfilled its
commitments -- had been approved last week by the Security
Council, Dini added.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Gang Ringleader Sentenced to Death (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Cheung Tze Keung, ringleader
of a 36-member gang which committed a series of felonies in Hong
Kong and the mainland, was sentenced to death here this morning by
the Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou, capital of south
China's Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Cheung was also deprived of his political rights all his life.
</P>
<P>
In a public announcement of its first instance verdict, the
court also sentenced Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang Hui and
Chin Hon-sau, all convicted as principal criminals, to death, with
their political rights deprived all their lives.
</P>
<P>
Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan were sentenced to death with a two-year
suspension, while Cai Zhijie and 28 other defendants were
sentenced to life imprisonment or fixed prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The defendants were charged with crimes of illegal trading in
and transport of explosives, smuggling of firearms and ammunition,
kidnapping, robbery, illegal trading in guns and ammunition,
illegal possession of guns and ammunition, and concealing stolen
goods.
</P>
<P>
Cheung and the 35 other defendants -- 18 are Hong Kong
residents and the rest are mainland residents -- were all arrested
on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
The crimes of which they were accused were mostly
cross-regional, committed in both Hong Kong and the mainland, with
a few committed solely in the mainland. According to Article 24
of China's Criminal Procedure Law, mainland judicial organs have
jurisdiction over this case.
</P>
<P>
The Guangzhou City Intermediate People's Court decided to
set up a collegial panel to openly try the case on October 20
after reviewing the legal proceedings in this case, instituted by
the Guangzhou City People's Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
The court acted strictly in accordance with the stipulations of
the Criminal Procedure Law of China, and guaranteed the procedural
rights of Cheung and other defendants according to law.
</P>
<P>
Along with sending copies of the indictments to the defendants
within the legally-prescribed time, informing them of the time of
the court hearing and making a public announcement of the
hearing, the court also assigned three lawyers from the local
legal assistance center to defend the two defendants who were
without counsels.
</P>
<P>
The defendants' family members and people from various walks of
life attended the hearing, and 60 lawyers were present in the
court to serve as defence counsels for the 36 defendants.

<HEADLINE> OSCE Verification Mission Leader Arrives in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The head of the verification
mission in Kosovo arrived in the province on Wednesday,
proclaiming that the international community's efforts to achieve
peace had at last begun in earnest.
</P>
<P>
U.S. diplomat William Walker, leader of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) team, said at Pristina
airport that his arrival marked the real beginning of the efforts
for ending hostilities and achieving peace in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached between Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic and U.S. Envoy Richard Holbrooke on October 13, the OSCE
will send a 2,000-strong mission to Kosovo to verify the
implementation of U.N. Resolution 1199 on the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Walker said that he could not say exactly when the final batch
of the mission would move in and that he hoped the mission would
complete its deployment as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
He called on Kosovo Serbs and ethnic Albanians to choose a
rational and peaceful method to resolve the crisis.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the mission would be impartial in carrying
out its duties.
</P>
<P>
He said that he would stay in Kosovo for the next few weeks
before leaving for Vienna to attend an OSCE foreign ministerial
meeting early next month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in Vienna, the OSCE approved the budget for the
verification mission, which was estimated at 200 million
U.S. dollars over one year.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the OSCE said that the OSCE permanent council
voted an immediate budget of 60.35 million dollars for the rest of
1998 while the remaider would be decided in January.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Men's Badminton Doubles Want Fixed Partnership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- Top Indonesian men's doubles
player Candra Wijaya has said he needed time to settle into a
partnership with Tony Gunawan after Sigit Budiarto's self-imposed
break from the sport over alleged drug use.
</P>
<P>
"When coaches and officials said my partnership with Tony
would be only temporary, I was really doubtful. I still am. I
don't know what will happen to us after the Asiad," Candra told
the Jakarta Post on Wednesday during a training session at the
National Badminton Center in East Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
"If they believe that Tony and I can work together and win
some tournaments, they must give us a chance and not only view
our results in the Indonesia Open and the Asiad. It takes times
to be partners. If the results are bad, they can't just separate
us without any compromise. It's about someone's career," he said.
</P>
<P>
Candra's partnership with Sigit resulted in a World
Championship title. The duo was rated along with compatriots
Ricky Subagjaand Rexy Mainaky among the top contenders for the
Asian Games in Bangkok in December.
</P>
<P>
Their partnership was disrupted after the Singapore Open in
August when Sigit allegedly tested positive for the anabolic
steroid nandrolone. The International Badminton Federation (IBF)
is scheduling a hearing.
</P>
<P>
Candra and Tony, both aged 23, lost to Ricky and Rexy in the
Indonesia Open in October.
</P>
<P>
Separately, Tony, who usually partners Halim Heryanto, said:
"If coaches want me to split up with Candra after the Asiad, it
is up to them, but I hope to have a fixed partner."
</P>
<P>
Tony, whose long-term target with Halim was to qualify for the
Olympics, said he was under a lot of pressure because of Candra's
high IBF ranking.
</P>
<P>
"Well, sometimes I feel burdened. But I won't think about it
too much. Luckily, Candra and I are roommates (at the center
dormitory). We can talk about it," Tony, who joined the center
in 1993 , was quoted by the Jakarta Post Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Both shuttlers said they needed to compete in the Hong Kong
Open as a warmup for the Asian Games.
</P>
<P>
"We still have to improve our teamwork. We need a competitive
situation. I don't care what the result in Hong Kong will be,
but I want to test our skills," Candra said.
</P>
<P>
Candra and Tony hoped they could retain the gold medal for
Indonesia at the quadrennial event which begins on December 6 and
ends on December 20.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Gang Leader Sentenced to Death (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
During the open trial, the court fully heard the accusations of
the prosecutors and the defense arguments for the defendants. On
the basis of material and written evidence, witness testimony,
confessions and apologies from the defendants, and the conclusions
of legal appraisals, all verified by investigation, the court
finally established the criminal facts concerning Cheung Tze-keung
and the other defendants as follows:
</P>
<P>
In September 1997, defendants Cheung Tze-keung, Chin Hon-sau,
and Lau Ting-fan plotted to buy explosives. With Cheung's funding,
they bought 818.483 kilograms of dynamite, 2,000 blasting caps,
and a 750-meter-long fuse in the city of Shanwei, Guangdong
Province, and then smuggled the explosives into Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
During May and June of 1995, defendant Chan Chi-ho asked his
accomplices to smuggle into Hong Kong 25.4 kilograms of dynamite
which he had illegally purchased in Haifeng County, Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
In 1991 and 1996, defendant Cheung Tze-keung and the other
defendants smuggled into Hong Kong guns and ammunition they had
illegally bought in the mainland.
</P>
<P>
After plotting in the cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and
Dongguan, defendant Cheung Tze-keung and his accomplices kidnapped
three persons in Hong Kong whose surnames were Li, Lam, and Kwok,
and extorted 1.638 billion HK dollars in ransom money in May 1996
and September 1997, respectively.
</P>
<P>
From the end of 1994 to early 1995, defendants Chan Chi-ho, Ma
Shangzhong, Liang Hui, Cai Zhijie, Yu Hanjun, Huang Yi and others
stole a bill of lading for steel, which belonged to a Tianjin
company, in Shenzhen and sold 277.39 tons of the steel. The
victim, whose surname was Li, was killed during the theft.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong Gang Leader Sentenced to Death (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The court determined that defendant Cheung Tze-keung had played
the role of organizer, planner and director of the joint crimes of
illegally purchasing and selling explosives, smuggling arms and
ammunition, and kidnapping, and thus should be regarded as the
principal criminal; Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong and Liang Hui
carried guns while committing the joint crime of robbery, which
involved an extremely large amount of money and property and led
to the death of one victim, and thus should all be regarded as
principals; the amount of explosives bought and sold by Chin
Hon-sau was extremely large, and Chin played a major role in this
serious case, so he should also be regarded as a principal
criminal; Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan are also principals, since they
were involved in stealing an extremely large amount of money and
property under serious circumstances.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with Article 26 of the Criminal Law, these
aforementioned principal criminals should be punished for all the
crimes they either participated in or organized and directed. As
for Cai Zhijie and 28 other defendants, they should receive due
punishment in accordance with the facts, circumstances and
consequences of the crimes they committed respectively, and for
their roles in the joint crimes.
</P>
<P>
Because defendant Chen Huiguang spontaneously confessed to some
of his crimes, and Cheung Chi-fung and Hon Fat rendered some
meritorious service, they can receive mitigated punishment
according to law.
</P>
<P>
Based on the stipulations of Article 12 of the Criminal Law of
the People's Republic of China, the Guangzhou Municipal
Intermediate People's Court, in accordance with the Criminal Law
and its 1979 version, as well as with the Supplementary
Stipulations On Punishing The Crime of Smuggling and the Decision
To Severely Punish Criminals Seriously Harming Public Security

Congress, delivered its first instance verdict as follows:
</P>
<P>
Cheung was sentenced to death and deprivation of political

explosives, smuggling of arms and ammunition, and kidnapping. The
court also decided to confiscate his property worth 662.1 million
RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>
Chan was sentenced to death and deprivation of political rights
for the rest of his life for crimes of robbery, smuggling of arms
and ammunition, kidnapping, illegal transport of explosives,

property worth 295.64 million RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Peruvian President Alberto
Fujimori will attend the sixth informal leadership meeting of the
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) scheduled for Nov. 17-18
in Malaysia, press report said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Peru will officially become a member of the
group to be the fifth APEC country from America after the United
States, Canada, Mexico and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Peru first requested to become a full member of APEC in October
1991 together with Mexico and Chile, whose memberships were
accepted in 1993 and 1994 respectively.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 APEC informal leadership meeting declared a three-year
moratorium to the access of new members.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, Peru was accepted as a "guest non-member
economy" to attend meetings on fishing and tourism. It was later
invited to attend trade promotion and energy talks.
</P>
<P>
At its 1997 leadership meeting, APEC announced Peru would be
accepted as a full member.
</P>
<P>
Peru's trade with APEC members currently accounts for 50
percent of its total exports and imports. Peruvian exports to
APEC countries have grown from 1.5 billion U.S. dollars in 1990 to
3.4 billion dollars last year, while imports from APEC members
soared from 1.1 billion dollars to 4 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Argentine President Opens Global Warming Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Argentine President
Carlos Menem inaugurated Wednesday the final phase of talks held
here by 160 nations to reduce global warming.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Menem urged the industrialized nations
to reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
Developing nations participating in the talks have argued that
industrialized countries should first reduce their carbon dioxide
output because they are largely responsible for the problem.
</P>
<P>
They also said that their emerging economies should not be set
back by costly pollution reductions.
</P>
<P>
At a landmark conference last year in Kyoto, Japan, over three
dozen industrialized countries pledged to cut their pollution
output by 5 percent from the 1990 levels by the year 2012.
</P>
<P>
The United States has yet to sign the Kyoto protocol, which has
been stalled in the Senate by opponents arguing that the treaty
needs a greater commitment from developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Argentine President Menem said his country had managed to
balance its economic growth together with cleaner industries.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 years, Argentina had maintained an average
6-percent annual growth rate while its carbon dioxide output had
remained under 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations talks on global warming, which started on
November 2 at the ministerial level, are scheduled to end Friday.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Chirac's Mexico Tour to Focus on Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, November 11 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques
Chirac is expected to arrive here late Wednesday for a three-day
visit to boost his country's growing economic presence in one of
the members of the North American free trade market.
</P>
<P>
Chirac will also promote the presence of French companies which
are taking part in bidding for Mexico's privatization of its
strategic state-run energy sector, including electricity
production, natural gas distribution and secondary petrochemicals.
</P>
<P>
French companies have been facing difficulties following the
signing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between
Mexico, the United States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
Under the new NAFTA rules, French companies can only be based
in Mexico as branch offices of their own U.S.- or Canada-based
branch companies.
</P>
<P>
The president, who had said that Mexico had become a priority
country for French investments, is also expected to give Mexico
support for its upcoming free trade agreement with the European
Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Chirac arrives only 48 hours after Mexico and the EU began
preliminary negotiations towards forging the first free trade
agreement between Europe and a Latin American country.
</P>
<P>
According to EU representatives in Mexico City, market access,
services and capital movements are high on the agenda of the talks.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Mexico's second largest trading partner after the
U.S., but two-way trade has shrunk to seven percent from 14
percent of Mexico's total foreign trade since Mexico entered NAFTA
in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Mexico exported 94 billion U.S. dollars of
goods to the U.S. last year and only 4.5 billion dollars to the EU.
</P>
<P>
Diplomats here said Chirac and his entourage of business
executives have come to Mexico to recover ground lost since Mexico
suffered its severe economic crisis in 1995.
</P>
<P>
After Mexico, Chirac will travel to Guatemala where he is to
attend a summit of Central American presidents and meet with 1992
Nobel Peace Prize laureate Rigoberta Menchu, a Quiche Indian.
</P>
<P>
The French president's Latin America tour will also include
brief visits to Honduras, Nicaragua and El Salvador.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia, IMF to Finalize New Letter of Intent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government and
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) are expected to finalize the
latest letter of intent on Friday, the IMF's Asia-Pacific Director
Hubert Neiss said.
</P>
<P>
"We have almost finished. We are very close to agreeing. We may
finalize before Mr. Ginandjar leaves for Kuala Lumpur," Neiss was
quoted by national newspapers Thursday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Economy, Finance and Industry
Ginandjar Kartasasmita, who is in charge of the country's IMF-led
reform program, is scheduled to go to Kuala Lumpur on Friday for
the leadership conference of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum (APEC).
</P>
<P>
Neiss arrived in Jakarta on Tuesday to conduct a regular
monthly review of the country's economic reform program.
</P>
<P>
He said his monthly visit would now be focusing on accelerating
bank restructuring and social safety net expenditure, and
reassessing the country's macroeconomic outlook.
</P>
<P>
Neiss expressed satisfaction over the new repayment scheme for
a large proportion of more than 141 trillion rupiah (18 billion
U.S. dollars) in government loans injected into troubled banks.
</P>
<P>
The new format would allow the Indonesian government to get a
maximum return on the loans, and at the same time preserve the
companies surrendered as collateral by the owners of the banks, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian government reached a new repayment deal on
Tuesday with owners of five troubled banks for 96.53 trillion
rupiah in liquidity support injected by Bank Indonesia into the
institutions since early this year.
</P>
<P>
The bank owners would repay 27 percent of the loans in cash in
the first year, and the balance in equal installments over the
next three years.
</P>
<P>
The new format is a revision of the October 1 scenario made by
President B.J. Habibie that demanded bank owners repay the loans
in cash in one year.
</P>
<P>
The changes were made following an October 18 letter from Neiss
to Habibie urging the government to be flexible with the repayment
mechanism as a "fire sale" of assets under the current depressed
economic conditions would result in lower than realistic prices.

Local engineers have opted for the ferry as the best means of

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Michael Jordan is likely
to play his first game this season in an exhibition in Las Vegas
in the first weekend of December, according to union director
Billy Hunter Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"Whether or not Jordan will play won't be known until the last
moment. If he doesn't play, he'll coach. But he'll be physically
present," Hunter said after the union's negotiating committee and
several team player representatives met for near six hours to
discuss their strategy in New York today.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said he would call commissioner David Stern tonight or
Thursday to decide whether the two sides should meet to talk
again.
</P>
<P>
"He has indicated that he does have another proposal. When he
puts it out there remains to be seen," Hunter said. "I think what
he wants to do is sweat our players a little more and see whether
there's any inclination on our part to want to submit."
</P>
<P>
If another three weeks go by without an agreement, the season
can not be started until 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some agents are trying to organize an exhibition game in Las
Vegas for the first weekend of December.
</P>
<P>
Hunter said the Showtime cable network has expressed interest
in televising the game. Hunter said the game might be a matchup
between two of the three Dream Teams that competed in the 1992
and 1996 Olympics and the 1994 World Championships.
</P>
<P>
"Our players are interested in keeping themselves busy, and we
think that one way to do it is have some sort of an exhibition
competition," Hunter said."The proceeds would go to the union."

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Eager to Promote Its Interests at APEC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, November 12 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley says that her main focus at the forthcoming APEC
Leaders' Meeting in Kuala Lumpur would be to "promote New
Zealand's interests."
</P>
<P>
Shipley is to leave for the meeting on Sunday. New Zealand will
do its best to promote the "liberalization of world trade," urging
other countries, Japan in particular, to drop their tariffs,
according to local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Koumura paid a
flying visit to Wellington, telling his New Zealand counterpart
Don McKinnon that Japan decided not to go ahead with cuts in
tariffs on fish and forestry products -- two main commodities New
Zealand exports to Japan.
</P>
<P>
After their meeting, Foreign Affairs and Trade Minister
McKinnon said the Japanese decision not to go ahead was "an
irritation that could result in other countries' refusal to move
in other areas," and that New Zealand wanted continual reductions
in tariffs before the 2010 deadline both New Zealand and Japan had
committed to for zero tariffs.
</P>
<P>
McKinnon was said to have warned Koumura that there is a danger
that what is a small issue could become magnified and affect the
whole of APEC.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that if Japan cut tariffs on fish and forestry
products, New Zealand would gain an extra 70 million U.S. dollars
in export business.
</P>
<P>
There have been indications that this year's APEC leaders'
meeting "will prove the most difficult yet in which to reach
agreement on how to make progress" in liberalization of world
trade, the New Zealand Press Association (NZPA) said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
NZPA quoted Prime Minister Shipley as saying that she doesn't
want to "preempt" negotiations on the issue by "speculating on
their outcome," but hoped progress would be made.
</P>
<P>
She said her main focus at APEC would be to promote New
Zealand's interests.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Shipley is likely to talk informally with
U.S. President Bill Clinton while at the meeting in Kuala Lumpur
next week. Unlike the leaders of the U.S. and Canada, she expects
to meet Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammed.
</P>
<P>
"It is not New Zealand's style to boycott meetings with
international leaders because of differences of opinion," she told
the New Zealand Parliament a few days ago.

<HEADLINE> New Funds to Philippines By IMF in Sight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, November 12 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) has committed the release of 130 million U.S. dollars to the
Philippines next month and agreed to maintain the Philippines'
growth and inflation rate projections for 1998, Manila Bulletin
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted Gabriel C. Singson, governor of the
Central Bank of the Philippines, as saying the agreement came
ahead of the conclusion of an ongoing economic review by the IMF.
</P>
<P>
"They are again disbursing $130 million by December 15 without
even waiting for the completion of the present review," Singson
said.
</P>
<P>
The amount, part of a total 1.34-billion-U.S.-dollar financing
package followed an earlier release totaling 280 million U.S.
dollars by the fund.
</P>
<P>
An IMF team is currently conducting its third review of the
country's monetary and fiscal targets under a two-year
precautionary loan arrangement.
</P>
<P>
The IMF team has accepted the government's 1998 growth
projection of 1.0 percent for GDP as well as the average inflation
rate of 9.25 percent to 9.75 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the newspaper quoted informed sources as disclosing
that the Philippine team and the IMF mission have yet to reach a
consensus on the GDP growth for next year.
</P>
<P>
Singson and Finance Secretary Edgardo B.Espiritu are expected
to make a joint statement with the IMF panel by Friday noon
announcing the basic agreement that had been reached during the
two-week review.

<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Chinese shuttlers defeated
their English rivals 3-2 in Portsmouth, England Wednesday night
for a 3-0 lead in the six-match series.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Hui, who lost to 33-year-old England number one Darren
Hall in staight games on Monday in China's opening 4-1 win at
Gateshead, had a revenge Wednesday evening with a gruelling
three-setter 15-9, 8-15 and 15-9 win in the men's singles.
</P>
<P>
It was thought he would run out of stamina in the third set
against the superfit former European champion but he surprised
Hall to put China 2-1 up on the night.
</P>
<P>
China had taken an unexpected lead when Lu Ying and Gao Ling
won the women's doubles 15-9, 15-4 against Commonwealth Games
champions Jo Goode and Donna Kellogg who was hampered by an ankle
problem.
</P>
<P>
Simon Archer and Chris Hunt, the European champions, beat Xia
Xuanze and Cai Yun 15-8, 15-4 to put England back in the match.
</P>
<P>
But after Xiao's victory, China played their trump card by
giving Pi Hongyan her first appearance of the week-long tour.
</P>
<P>
The 19-year-old, who beat Julia Mann and Tanya Woodward on the
1997 tour, came back from 0-3 to beat Rebecca Pantaney 11-5 11-4

<HEADLINE> Evans Agrees to Leave Liverpool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Liverpool joint manager Roy
Evans has agreed to leave the position, according to the early
editions of Thursday's newspapers.
</P>
<P>
The papers reported that Evans had talks with the Liverpool
board on Wednesday night where he declined offers of a move
"upstairs" to a general manager's role.
</P>
<P>
His departure will leave Frenchman Gerard Houllier in sole
charge of the English Premier League club.
</P>
<P>
Evans, in joint charge of team affairs with Houllier since the
beginning of this season, had been under mounting pressure as
Liverpool managed just one win in their last eight league games.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday's 3-1 home League Cup defeat by Tottenham compounded
the problem and Evans, connected with the club on and off the
pitch for more than 30 years, agreed to let Houllier take sole
control.
</P>
<P>
Evans, somewhat reluctantly, took over from Graeme Souness in
1994 but has failed to win the trophies expected after three
decades of success at Anfield.
</P>
<P>
Much liked and respected by fans and players alike, he was
sometimes considered "too nice" for the harsh world of
management. He now appears to have completely severed his
Anfield ties and is awaiting details of his pay-off.
</P>
<P>
Former France coach Houllier was reported to be bringing in
former Lens coach Patrice Bergues as his assistant, to replace
Doug Livermore who is also reportedly leaving.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds Learning Music Enhances Verbal Memory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Adults who received music
training before the age of 12 had a better memory for spoken words
than those who had no music lessons in their childhood, according
to a new study.
</P>
<P>
"We found that adults with music training learned significantly
more words than those without any music training," Dr Agnes Chan
of the Chinese University of Hong Kong, China, said Wednesday in a
letter to the scientific journal Nature.
</P>
<P>
Dr Chan and her colleagues tested 60 female college students
from their university with 30 of them having at least six years'
training with one Western musical instrument before the age of 12
and the other half receiving no music training.
</P>
<P>
After reading the students some words and asking them to
remember them, the researcher found that people who have had music
training can remember about 17 percent more information than those
who have not had any music training.
</P>
<P>
It seems that this extra ability to remember spoken words is
based in left planum temporale region, a specific part of the
brain involved in remembering words, which is enlarged in
musicians, the researchers suggested.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Welcomes Israel's Approval of Peace Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The United States Wednesday
welcomed Israel's approval of a new Mideast peace accord reached
between Israeli and Palestinian leaders in the United States last
month.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, in welcoming the
Israeli cabinet's approval, also called for quick implementation
of the peace for security agreement, State Department spokesman
James Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"Secretary Albright welcomes today's decision of the Israeli
cabinet to approve the Wye River agreements as an important step
forward in the peace process," Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
"With that decision having been made, she believes all
concerned must now proceed to implement the agreement as quickly
as possible," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli cabinet ministers voted eight to four with five
abstentions to ratify the interim agreement that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
signed at the White House on October 23 after nine days of tough
negotiations at a secluded retreat at the Wye River, Maryland.
</P>
<P>
But the Israeli cabinet also laid down conditions for
implementing the accord, including a Palestinian National Council
vote to annul anti-Israel clauses in the Palestinian charter and
the third stage troop redeployment will be no more than 1 percent
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
The accord called on Israel to withdraw from a further 13
percent of the West Bank by the end of January in exchange for the
Palestinian National Authority's intensified crackdown on Islamic
militants.

<HEADLINE> UK to Put New Initiative to Push N.Ireland Peace Pro cess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government said on
Wednesday it was ready to launch a new initiative to push forward
the Northern Ireland peace process now in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the government plans
to recognize the six-month-old ceasefire called by a hardline
pro-British guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) has pledged to
hand over "a small but very real amount of arms" within two weeks
after the government acknowledges its ceasefire and allows it to
join a scheme under which guerrilla prisoners are let out of jail
early.
</P>
<P>
"I said I would keep the LVF's ceasefire under review and that
is what I have been doing," Mowlam said after a lecture to
military experts. "I will make a decision this week or next week
on that."
</P>
<P>
That could help persuade the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The peace process went into impasse after IRA refused to hand
over its massive weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace agreement, intended to draw a line
under 30 years of bloody conflict, made no mention of a deadline
for the disarmament process to start although it states clearly
that it must be complete within two years.

<HEADLINE> IMF Approves Second Annual ESAF Loan for Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) Wednesday approved the second annual loan for Uganda
under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF),
equivalent to about 46 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The loan is provided to support the government's economic
program for 1998/99, started from July 1, this year.
</P>
<P>
The loan is available in two semiannual installments, the first
of which, equivalent to some 23 million dollars, will be disbursed
on November 25.
</P>
<P>
The government's medium-term economic strategy is aimed at
realizing average real growth of 7 percent a year, containing
inflation at 5 percent and maintaining gross international
reserves at a level equivalent to about five months of imports.
The overall fiscal deficit would increase moderately to 6.7
percent of GDP during 1998/99, and decline gradually to 6.0
percent by 2000/2001.
</P>
<P>
The ESAF is a concessional IMF facility for assisting member
countries that are undertaking economic reform programs to
strengthen their balance of payments and improve their growth
prospects.
</P>
<P>
Uganda joined the IMF in September 1963. Its quota is about 186
million dollars and by the end of September this year, its
outstanding use of IMF resources totaled about 377 million
dollars.

<HEADLINE> Aziz: Iraq Does Not Request UNSCOM, IAEA to Leave </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Iraq did not request
the Untied Nations Special Commission (UNSCOM) and the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to leave the country,
Iraq said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, Iraq's Deputy
Prime Minister Tareq Aziz said, "The government of Iraq did not
request UNSCOM and IAEA to leave Iraq. Also, the decision of the
government of Iraq of October 31, 1998 permits IAEA to continue
its work within the framework of monitoring."
</P>
<P>
"In the light of American threats to launch a military
aggression against Iraq without authorization from the Security
Council, the decision of UNSCOM fully proves once again that
UNSCOM acts in accordance with the orders of the government of the
United States and that it coordinates its actions with it," Aziz
said.
</P>
<P>
"This confirms what we had repeatedly stated in our
communications with you and the Security Council and in our
statements about the links between UNSCOM and the United States,"
Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
"These developments place a grave responsibility upon the
Security Council and you under the U.N. Charter, and we hope that
actions in regard to these developments will be taken
accordingly," he added.
</P>
<P>
The letter came after the UNSCOM and the IAEA decided Wednesday
morning to withdraw all their arms staff from Iraq due to the
safety of all the personnel. There have been reports that the
United States is preparing to launch a military strike against
Iraq because its refusal to resume cooperation with the U.N. arms
inspectors.

<HEADLINE> UK to Put New Initiative to Push N.Ireland Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The British government said on
Wednesday it was ready to launch a new initiative to push forward
the Northern Ireland peace process now in stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam said the government plans
to recognize the six-month-old ceasefire called by a hardline
pro-British guerrilla group.
</P>
<P>
The pro-British Loyalist Volunteer Force (LVF) has pledged to
hand over "a small but very real amount of arms" within two weeks
after the government acknowledges its ceasefire and allows it to
join a scheme under which guerrilla prisoners are let out of jail
early.
</P>
<P>
"I said I would keep the LVF's ceasefire under review and that
is what I have been doing," Mowlam said after a lecture to
military experts. "I will make a decision this week or next week
on that."
</P>
<P>
That could help persuade the Irish Republican Army (IRA) to
follow suit.
</P>
<P>
The peace process went into impasse after IRA refused to hand
over its massive weaponry.
</P>
<P>
The Northern Ireland peace agreement, intended to draw a line
under 30 years of bloody conflict, made no mention of a deadline
for the disarmament process to start although it states clearly
that it must be complete within two years.

<HEADLINE> UK's Two Parties Announce New Deal on Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Britain's ruling Labor Party
and the third party the Liberal Democratic Party announced a new
deal on Wednesday on more cooperation in political affairs.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement, Prime Minister Tony Blair and Liberal
Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown announced that their existing,
informal pact will be deepened to cover any area where the two
parties agree.
</P>
<P>
"Our aims are simply stated - to work together in building a
modern Britain. To create a new, more constructive and more
rational culture for our national politics," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"To ensure the ascendancy of progressive politics in Britain,
against a Conservative party which seems determined to travel
further and further to the right. And to continue the re-shaping
of British politics for the next century," it added.
</P>
<P>
Top of the agenda for cooperation is Europe, where the two
parties support Britain's eventual entry into the single currency.
</P>
<P>
The move will spark serious concern among some Labor and
Liberal Democrat members who believe the two parties should remain
completely independent.
</P>
<P>
Sources said there is no doubt that Blair would like to see a
lasting pact between the two parties in a bid to ensure the
Conservatives were never again elected to power.
</P>
<P>
And the joint statement, signed by both men, is the clearest
sign yet that their alliance is becoming more significant.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet "enforcer" Jack Cunningham and deputy Liberal Democrat
leader Alan Beith will work together to develop the alliance,
currently based on a joint consultative committee which has been
looking only at constitutional reform.
</P>
<P>
But Blair and Ashdown said that they were still two sovereign
and independent parties working together where they agree and
opposing each other where they do not.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident this step forward can deepen cooperation and
result in widening support for the kind of progressive change
which we wish to see and to which we believe the British people
are strongly committed," the joint statement said.

<HEADLINE> Scientists Complete Typhus Gene Map </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Swedish scientists announced
Wednesday that they have mapped all the 834 genes in Rickettsia
prowazekii, the bacterium that causes epidemic typhus.
</P>
<P>
Typhus has been one of the great killers in human history with
20 to 30 million deaths after the First World War alone. New
epidemics of typhus are now raging in Burundi in Central Africa,
and threaten to surface elsewhere in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Spread by lice and left untreated, typhus can lead to death
within three weeks. Symptoms of the disease include fever,
delirium, and rash. The brain, heart, lungs, and kidneys can also
be affected.
</P>
<P>
The complete DNA sequence of the genome of Rickettsia
prowazekii, published Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature,
will now help scientists develop better treatments and effective
vaccines.
</P>
<P>
"It becomes much more straightforward now to generate vaccines,
either by traditional means or the new DNA techniques," said Dr
Charles Kurland of the University of Uppsala, Sweden, who led the
research.
</P>
<P>
In addition to possible medical insights, the research is of
special interest to scientists because of its close resemblance to
mitochondria, the powerhouse of cells.
</P>
<P>
Many biologists believe that mitochondria, which have their own
genomes independent of the main genome in a cell's nucleus, were
once free-living organisms that adopted a life of parasitism or
symbiosis before becoming totally dependent on their host.
</P>
<P>
The latest work by Swedish scientists provides strong evidence
in support of the idea that Rickettsia prowazekii captures a stage
in the evolution of mitochondria from independent organisms.
</P>
<P>
The scientists have found that the typhus bacterium and
mitochondria have many similar functional profiles.
</P>
<P>
For example, like mitochondria, the bacterium lacks many genes
found in free-living organisms for the synthesis of amino acids
and nucleosides, components of nucleotide bases, relying on the
host for the supply of these compounds.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Material in Groundwater Moves Faster </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Radioactive contaminants
can migrate in groundwater over long distances faster than
originally thought, according to the results of field tests at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
The testing was carried out by researchers from the
Laboratory in conjunction with those from the University of
Tennessee and Colorado State University, said the Web edition
of Environmental Science and Technology Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
About 50 percent of all Americans get their drinking water
from groundwater sources, hence the finding of the field tests
has broad implications for risk and performance assessments of
current and future waste disposal facilities.
</P>
<P>
Using non-radioactive surrogates injected into groundwater as
tracers, the researchers found that dissolved humic material can
bind radionuclides and prevent them from being retained in
soil, thereby speeding the migration of the contaminant. The
tracers moved at almost the same velocity as the groundwater,
and were observed 10 to 80 meters from the injection site within
a week or less.
</P>
<P>
Their finding challenges the results of laboratory tests that
suggested contaminants strongly bind to the soil and move only
centimeters a year.
</P>
<P>
Scientists said that the results have significant implications
as to the role even typically low levels of dissolved
humics in groundwater can play in contaminant mobility with
respect to existing waste facilities and future repositories.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Cypriots Slam EU Over Cypriot Accession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriots Wednesday
accused the European Union (EU) of formally starting membership
talks with Cyprus, saying this could lead to "a permanent
division of the island."
</P>
<P>
A written statement issued by the self-declared "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus" described the accession talks as a
new chain added to a series of mistakes made by the EU, according
to the Anatolia News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Greek Cypriot-dominated Cypriot
government has no right to apply for a full EU membership on
behalf of Turkish Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
"The EU will bear the responsibility for the consolidation or
permanent division of the island," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the statement also said that Turkish Cypriots will
take steps to integrate with Turkey in order to counter the
EU-Cypriot efforts.
</P>
<P>
The EU officially opened membership talks with Cyprus Tuesday
despite strong opposition from Turkish Cypriots and Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey landed
its troops and took over the northern third of the island in the
wake of an abortive coup seeking union with Greece.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. have been trying for decades to reunite the island
through a bi-communal formula, but the Turkish Cypriots opted out
of the peace talks to protest the EU's decision to begin accession
talks with Cyprus while scraping its ally Turkey off its immediate
membership candidates list.
</P>
<P>
But Cypriot Foreign Minister Ioannis Kasoulides said that the
Cypriot membership talks will benefit both sides of the island
state.

<HEADLINE> More Americans Use Alternative Therapies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, November 11 (Xinhua) -- The number of Americans who
are using alternative treatments such as herbal supplements,
massage therapy and megavitamins is increasing dramatically, said
the Washington Post Wednesday by quoting studies published in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
"It is the beginning of the beginning of acceptance of some
forms of 1998 alternative medicine into mainstream medicine in the
United States," said George Lundberg, editor of the JAMA.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 83 million American adults, more than four out of
10, used some form of alternative medical treatment last year,
said a new survey by a Harvard research team.
</P>
<P>
They said that visits to practitioners of alternative
therapies, from herbal medicines to "energy healing," have
increased 47 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
In addition to herbal medicine and "energy healing," the
alternative therapies included in the survey were relaxation
techniques, massage therapy, chiropractic, spiritual healing,
megavitamins, self-help, imagery, homeopathy, hypnosis,
biofeedback, acupuncture, folk remedies and various diets.
</P>
<P>
Among the fastest growing therapies were herbal remedies,
massage, megavitamins, relaxation techniques and "spiritual
healing."
</P>
<P>
One study found that moxibustion, a traditional Chinese therapy
in which a herb, Artemisia vulgaris, was burned next to an
acupuncture point on the toe, proved safe and effective for
stimulating fetuses in the wombs of pregnant women to turn over
from a breech position to a head-first position, which is safer
for delivery.
</P>
<P>
However, some medical experts have expressed concern that
herbal products, which do not have to meet any official government
purity or manufacturing standards, may carry dangerous impurities.

<HEADLINE> FMs of Damascus Declaration States Meeting in Doha </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Following a year and half
deadlock, the Damascus Declaration signatory states' foreign
ministers started their 16th meeting in Doha Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Doha said the current crisis between Iraq and the
United Nations is expected to feature high on the agenda of the
two-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers will also discuss the Mideast process,
their relations with Iran, and the means to promote cooperation
among Damascus Declaration member states, particularly in the
security domain.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, Syria and the members of the Gulf Cooperation Council,
namely Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United
Arab Emirates, signed the Damascus Declaration after the 1991 Gulf
War to create a mechanism aimed at guaranteeing security in the
Gulf region. They used to hold bi-annual meetings regularly.
</P>
<P>
At the 16th meeting, the foreign ministers are expected to take
actions on two two documents yet to be approved. The first is a
security cooperation protocol which has not been decided owing to
Syrian reservations.
</P>
<P>
The second concerns the establishment of a pan-Arab market, an
idea that has been proposed during their last meeting but they had
not an opportunity to discuss it.
</P>
<P>
A team of experts from the declaration member states met in
Cairo in December 1997 to work out the practical steps for the
pan-Arab market and pave the way for economic integration among
the member states.
</P>
<P>
That meeting raised hope for such a market to be formed upon
agreement by member states.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing ministerial meeting had been scheduled for late last
year, but was delayed due to Egyptian-Qatari standoff triggered by
Egypt's boycott of an economic conference hosted by Doha.
</P>
<P>
Egypt was against the holding of the 1997 Middle East and North
Africa Economic Conference, which included Israel, as the Mideast
peace process deeply mired because of Israel's intransigence.
</P>
<P>
Now Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa denied there exists
any crisis between Egypt and Qatar, saying their bilateral
relations are "good and brotherly."

<HEADLINE> Turkish PM Rejects Resignation Call From Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, November 11 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz said Wednesday night that he will not resign from office
although the opposition parties have lodged a no-confidence
motion against his minority government.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to eight private televisions here, Yilmaz said that
the coalition government will continue to stay on and "struggle
against organized crimes."
</P>
<P>
"This is a plot and a trap. It can't be a reason for
resignation," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
The no-confidence motion was jointly made by the pro-Islamic
Virtue Party (FP), the largest party in the parliament, and the
True Path Party (DYP) led by former prime minister Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
The FP-DYP motion accused Yilmaz of interfering in the
privatization plan of the Turkish Trade Bank and helped a
businessman who was linked to mafia.
</P>
<P>
The FP is a successor of the former Welfare Party which formed
a coalition government with the DYP from 1996 to 1997 and was
outlawed by court last January.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Republican People's Party (CHP) Deniz Baykal
has reportedly urged Yilmaz to step down, saying his party might
vote for the no-confidence motion.
</P>
<P>
Observers here said that Yilmaz's tripartite coalition could
collapse if the CHP, which supports the minority government in
the parliament, supports the FP-DYP motion.
</P>
<P>
Husamettin Cindoruk, leader of the Democratic Turkey Party,
said that his party might withdraw from the the coalition
government, adding he will announce his party's decision Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit, leader
of the Democratic Left Party, who is on a working visit in
Bulgaria, declined to make any comments upon the latest
development.
</P>
<P>
The incumbent center-right coalition government, composed of
DTP, DLP, the Motherland Party (MP) led by Yilmaz, and
independents, came into power in June, 1990.
