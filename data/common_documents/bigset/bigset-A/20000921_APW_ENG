'Missile' Fired at Britain's MI6
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Unknown attackers fired a ''small missile'' at the
headquarters of Britain's MI6 intelligence agency in central London late
Wednesday, causing an explosion on the eighth floor, police said. The blast
caused limited damage and no injuries at the 10-story structure at the heart of
Britain's intelligence abroad. Witnesses reported hearing two explosions, large
enough to send up a plume of white smoke and to rattle buildings across a
railway. The blast brought firefighters, police and ambulances to the site on
the south bank of the River Thames, and police closed the area around the
headquarters.

<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Agents held 38 Iraqis at the Mexican border Wednesday after
small groups of them tried to walk into the United States without visas, INS
officials said. Mexican police detained about 150 others in a Tijuana hotel
room. A letter from someone claiming to represent the group said the Iraqis are
Chaldeans, who are Christian, who were tired of waiting in Tijuana for
permission to enter the United States and decided to present themselves en masse
at the border, according to an INS official speaking on condition of anonymity.

   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The remaining eight Cuban survivors of a plane crash
in the Gulf of Mexico were being transferred to a Coast Guard cutter to be
brought to Key West for medical evaluation today, a U.S. Coast Guard spokesman
said. A ninth survivor was already being treated in Key West for head and neck
injuries. ''The Coast Guard has decided to go ahead and medically evacuate the
remaining eight Cuban migrants,'' Petty Officer Scott Carr said. U.S. law lets
Cubans apply for residency if they reach U.S. soil.

<P>
   WACO, Texas (AP) -- A federal judge cleared the government of any wrongdoing
in the deaths of 80 Branch Davidians during the 1993 standoff with federal
agents at the cult's compound. U.S. District Judge Walter Smith's ruling, issued
late today, mirrors the conclusions an advisory jury and Special Counsel John
Danforth reached in July. Both have said Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
agents and others were not responsible for the deaths on the final day of a

<HEADLINE> Federal investigators probing jail visits to Torricelli donor  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Federal officials are investigating if allies of
New Jersey Sen. Robert Torricelli pressured a Democratic
fund-raiser not to cooperate with authorities, The New York Times
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Articles in other papers have said the FBI and federal
prosecutors with the Campaign Financing Task Force are examining
whether the donor, David Chang, received preferential treatment
during a three-day stay at the Hudson County Jail.
</P>
<P>
   One paper, The Jersey Journal of Jersey City, has said
investigators have asked whether Chang received sexual favors from
a female jail guard.
</P>
<P>
   Chang, 57, of Cresskill, admitted in June that he broke election
laws by funneling $53,700 into Torricelli's successful 1996 Senate
campaign. As part of a plea bargain he agreed to assist the task
force.
</P>
<P>
   While at the jail in Kearny for a weekend in December after his
arrest by FBI agents, Chang says he was visited by several men he
had not seen before, the Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Chang told prosecutors that one of the men told him not to
cooperate with authorities, while another simply put a finger to
his lips, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about report, Chang lawyer Bradley D. Simon said
Wednesday, ''I can't discuss it because of the pending
investigation, and he's a cooperating witness.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Simon denied that Chang had sex in jail: ''That is
complete fiction. It didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli spokesman Eric Shuffler said Wednesday, ''This is the
latest in a series of meritless allegations. One seems more bizarre
than the next. There is absolutely no truth to the suggestion that
anyone associated with this office tried to intimidate or
discourage David Chang from cooperating.''
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a task force spokesman at the Justice Department,
said Wednesday he could not comment on the report. Officials cannot
generally comment on pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Elements of the investigation have also been reported in The
Record of Hackensack and The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The jail investigation started in late July, the Times said.
Since then, FBI agents have seized log books and videotapes, said a
Hudson County spokeswoman, Julie St. Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Three guards - Lt. Kelvin Roberts, Enrique Marrero and James
Nieves - who were at the jail that weekend appeared before a
federal grand jury on Aug. 24, said their lawyer, Daniel J. Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   ''We think these allegations are ridiculous,'' Welsh told The
Associated Press. ''Nothing untoward happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Welsh said he did not know what Chang's specific allegations
were, due to grand jury secrecy rules, but called the sex
suggestions ''pretty much of a farce.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Budnick, a senior prison official who supervises the
three guards, also is expected to be questioned. The Times said
Budnick went to the jail that weekend at the request of an aide of
Hudson County Executive Robert C. Janiszewski.
</P>
<P>
   Budnick has said he ordered that Chang get another blanket after
getting a phone call from William W. Northgrave, the county
counsel, the Times said.
</P>
<P>
   Budnick lawyer Peter R. Willis has said his client did nothing
wrong. He was at a trial Wednesday and unavailable for comment, his
office said.
</P>
<P>
   Janiszewski denied intervening on Chang's behalf and said
Budnick ''simply would not be doing anything improper.''
</P>
<P>
   Northgrave told the newspaper he could not comment on whether he
called Budnick until the inquiry is concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Chang is among 25 people charged by the task force and among
seven who have admitted wrongdoing in connection with Torricelli
fund-raising efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli raised $9.2 million to defeat Rep. Richard A. Zimmer
in 1996. His fund-raising ability led to his appointment as
chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

<HEADLINE> 15-year-old agrees to return $285,000 in illegal stock profits  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - In less than half a year, Jonathan G. Lebed
reaped over a quarter-million dollars in profits by trading stocks
on the Internet, according to federal regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a raging bull market, the accomplishment would be of little
note except that Lebed was a 14-year-old sophomore in northern New
Jersey at the time.
</P>
<P>
   He made his money through 11 illegal manipulations involving
nine stocks, the Securities and Exchange Commission announced
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed, now 15, of Cedar Grove in Essex County, has agreed to
repay $285,000, which the SEC said represented illegal profits and
interest. He neither admitted nor denied the commission's findings,
but agreed to refrain from similar behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said Lebed reaped those profits by buying large blocks
of penny stocks, hyping them on financial message boards and then -
within 24 hours - dumping his shares after the price rose. The
trades took place from Aug. 23, 1999, to Feb. 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   SEC officials said it is the first time the agency has brought
charges against a minor.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed lawyer Kevin H. Marino described him as an intelligent,
well-rounded youngster ''who has been very interested in the
securities industry for some time and has been an avid investor.''
</P>
<P>
   He declined to make the boy available for an interview. The
family has an unlisted phone number.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said the case demonstrates the risks of Internet
stock tips.
</P>
<P>
   ''I implore investors to be highly skeptical of any advice they
receive from the Internet. People should do thorough research
before making investment decisions and verify all information
before acting on it,'' said Ronald C. Long, administrator of the
SEC's Philadelphia office, which handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   His associate director, Joy Thompson, said the agency could not
comment on how it learned of Lebed's trading. Marino said the case
began after the SEC identified trades ''it felt were problematic.''
</P>
<P>
   The stocks were in a variety of sectors, including entertainment
and the toy industry, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were very thinly traded, low-price stocks. They are very
volatile because they are very thinly traded,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed traded in custodial accounts in his father's name at two
brokers, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The stocks, traded on the NASD Over the Counter Electronic
Bulletin Board or the NASDAQ National Market, were Manchester
Equipment Co. Inc., Just Toys Inc., Yes Entertainment Inc.,
Fotoball USA Inc., Man Sang Holdings Inc., West Coast Entertainment
Inc., Havana Republic Inc., Classica Group Inc., and Firetector
Inc., according to SEC documents.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've not alleged any harm against these companies. But anyone
who was in the market and paying attention to these messages was
hurt if they bought in too late or sold too late,'' Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   No aggrieved investors have contacted the SEC, and no decision
has been made on whether they should be compensated, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC found that after Lebed bought a stock he sent hundreds
of identical, false e-mail messages, each under a fictitious name,
touting the stock he had just purchased.
</P>
<P>
   One claimed that a company trading at $2 per share would be
trading at more than $20 per share ''very soon.'' Other postings
claimed that a stock would be the ''next stock to gain 1,000
percent'' and was ''the most undervalued stock ever.''
</P>
<P>
   The SEC said, ''The posted messages always caused the price and
volume of the touted stocks to increase dramatically.''
</P>
<P>
   In some instances, Lebed placed a sell limit order before the
market closed on the day he purchased the stock to ensure that he
would not miss the price increase of the stock while he was in
school the next day.
</P>
<P>
   His profits on each trade ranged from more than $11,000 to
nearly $74,000, ultimately totaling $272,826. The $285 in that stock reached
either record or near-record
highs, in some cases reaching a 52-week high for both volume and
price, the SEC said.

<HEADLINE> Sports talk host sued for saying Miss America pageant fixed  </HEADLINE>
By BILL BERGSTROM
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) - The Miss America Pageant sued radio talk
show host Howard Eskin for slander Wednesday for saying the contest
was fixed. Eskin said he was joking.
</P>
<P>
   The beauty pageant filed suit in U.S. District Court in Camden,
N.J., against Eskin and Infinity Broadcasting Corp., owner of
Philadelphia radio station WIP-AM, said Robert M. Renneisen Jr.,
chief executive officer of the pageant.
</P>
<P>
   The suit alleges that Eskin's remarks might raise doubts that
could hurt the pageant's ability to raise scholarship money,
Renneisen told a news conference at the Philadelphia office of the
pageant's attorneys. It does not specify an exact amount of damages
being sought.
</P>
<P>
   Eskin said his comments were facetious and the radio station
said the lawsuit was without merit.
</P>
<P>
   Renneisen and attorney Steven P. Perske played a tape of an Aug.
22 broadcast in which Eskin chatted about revealing the winners of
contests such as CBS television's ''Survivor'' series. He went on
to say, ''I hope people know Miss America's fixed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Before they get into the weekend, they know who's going to
win,'' Eskin said on the tape. ''They already know, you know,
through all the screenings and all the other stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   A co-host mentioned ''all the judges out there,'' and Eskin
replied: ''That's phony.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eskin said in a statement issued by the station: ''I made
the comment in jest, and certainly did not think any of our
listeners would take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Eskin made a tongue-in-cheek comment in the context of a
humorous discussion about revealing the winners of contests ahead
of the public announcement,'' WIP general manager Butch Foster
said. ''WIP believes any lawsuit would be without merit.''
</P>
<P>
   Renneisen said the Atlantic City, N.J.-based pageant received
phone calls about Eskin's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ''We started hearing, 'Did you know this guy is saying these
things on the air, is it true?''' Renneisen said.
</P>
<P>
   He said the lawsuit was not just another attempt to boost
interest in the 79-year-old pageant after sagging television
ratings in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's certain types of publicity you seek and there's
certain types you don't,'' he said. ''Yes, we have fun with it. Are
we going to have two-piece or one-piece swimsuits? Who's going to
be the judge, who's going to be the host? ... Those are all things
that ... are part of the normal hype.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What's happened here is Mr. Eskin and Infinity Broadcasting
have accused us of a crime, of fraud,'' Renneisen said. ''That's a
lie. Not only is it a lie but it's a lie put in a malicious context
so that's slander.''
</P>
<P>
   The pageant had not yet measured any potential impact on its
scholarship-raising abilities but would do so as part of preparing
its case for court, he said.

<HEADLINE> Fed Judge Rules in Lieberman Case  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- A federal judge Wednesday ordered a man who
allegedly made a death threat against Joseph Lieberman to be held
in jail pending a psychiatric evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis C. Fulton is charged with threatening to kill the
Democratic vice presidential candidate because of his criticisms of
the entertainment industry.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton, 32, faces up to three years in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   He allegedly called Lieberman's office Sept. 15 and told a staff
member he had a gun and intended to kill the Connecticut senator,
according to a sworn statement by a Secret Service agent.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton left his name and telephone number. Agents who went to
his Tampa apartment found that he had put a deposit on a handgun at
a pawnshop the same day he called Lieberman's office.
</P>
<P>
   Fulton became agitated and threatened to kill the agents who
arrived at his home, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Rescued Cubans Being Brought To US  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The remaining eight Cuban survivors of a
plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico were brought to Key West for
medical evaluation Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A ninth survivor was already being treated at a Key West
hospital for head and neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to bring the remaining survivors ashore was based
on their medical conditions, said Coast Guard spokesman Marc
Woodring.
</P>
<P>
   He said one woman has cuts on her hands and legs, another woman
may have a broken collarbone, and the third woman may have a broken
rib.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to be prudent, want to make sure they were
getting everything they needed,'' said Petty Officer Scott Carr.
</P>
<P>
   The survivors -- including three children -- were to be taken to
Florida Lower Keys Hospital where the other survivor was being
treated. The body of a tenth Cuban, found after the plane went down
Tuesday, will also be brought to shore for an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law lets Cubans apply for residency if they reach U.S.
soil. Ordinarily, those who are picked up at sea are returned to
Cuba, but authorities said it was too early to say what would
happen with the nine plane crash survivors.
</P>
<P>
   A doctor from the Carnival Cruise ship Tropicale, which was
nearby when the plane went down, initially treated the survivors
onboard a freighter that rescued them. One woman had a broken
collarbone and another had a severe leg cut, Carnival spokesman
Andy Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo Fuentes, 36, was air-lifted from the Panamanian-flagged
freighter Chios Dream with head and neck injuries. Doctors said
Wednesday that he was in stable condition and doing well.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities interviewed Fuentes, but officials said details
of the interview were being withheld until the investigation was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Wednesday the Cuban plane doesn't appear to have
been hijacked, as Cuban officials said the pilot had reported, but
the agency is withholding a final determination until it questions
the eight survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still need to interview the people on the ship before we
can rule out a hijacking,'' said Judy Orihuela, an FBI spokeswoman
in Miami. ''At this point, it doesn't appear to be a hijacking, but
until we interview them we can't be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the FBI determines whether the plane was hijacked or flown
from Cuba voluntarily, immigration officials will be able to
determine if the survivors should qualify for asylum in the United
States. U.S. authorities have returned hijackers to Cuba for
prosecution and have prosecuted some in this country.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they pass the credible fear test they will be taken to
Guantanamo Bay (the U.S. base at the eastern end of Cuba). If they
do not, they will be repatriated to Cuba,'' said Maria Cardona, a
spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The credible fear test requires would-be immigrants to
demonstrate a fear of persecution in their home country ''based on
nationality, race, religion, political opinion or membership in a
particular social group.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the status of Fuentes, Cardona noted that he is
now on U.S. soil and eligible to stay.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
Cuban-American lawmakers from Miami, wrote to President Clinton on
Wednesday asking that all nine Cubans be granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly they will face persecution in Cuba for their
involvement in such a high-profile and risky attempt to flee the
island,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government had said the pilot reported to the control
tower that he was being hijacked and that the plane, a
Russian-built government crop-duster, was headed to Florida with a
group of adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Cuban government, published Wednesday in
the Communist Party daily Granma, said that pilot Lenin Iglesias
Hernandez apparently first took off in the plane at 7:35 a.m.
Tuesday from a small airstrip for what appeared to be a routine
crop-dusting flight. It said he flew to another airport, picked up
a group of people waiting at the end of a runway, then took off
again at 8:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in the southern Gulf of Mexico about 50 miles
west of Cuba and 285 miles from Key West. The Coast Guard said the
craft was heading west, toward Mexico, when it went down.

<HEADLINE> Cheney Criticizes U.S. on Saddam  </HEADLINE>
By KAREN GULLO
<TEXT>
<P>
   BAKERSFIELD, Calif. (AP) -- Dick Cheney on Wednesday blamed the
Clinton administration for letting Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein
''slip off the hook'' on U.N. weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning in ''Aerospace Valley''-- an area around Edwards Air
Force Base steeped in defense contractors and aviation history --
the Republican vice presidential nominee said the United States had
a ''very robust'' inspection capability under President Bush and
after the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were all the time going back to make certain that he wasn't
trying to rebuild his biological and chemical capability,'' said
Cheney, who was secretary of defense during the war.
</P>
<P>
   While Cheney says he did not think Saddam poses a military
threat to the United States, ''The thing I worry about is this
administration, I think, has let him slip off the hook, so to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now we've seen that he's kicked out all the inspectors and
this administration seems helpless to do anything about it,''
Cheney told a standing room only audience of several hundred in
Lancaster, Calif., where many local residents have spent
generations building fighter jets.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, the United States and Britain conducted
airstrikes over Iraq to punish Saddam for refusing to cooperate
with weapons inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   Some in Congress have charged that U.S. policy against Iraq has
been a failure. Administration officials have defended their
strategy of using economic sanctions, diplomacy, intelligence
gathering and military force, including enforcing no-fly zones over
Iraq jointly with Britain so Saddam cannot threaten his neighbors
or minorities in his country.
</P>
<P>
   Cheney's remarks were his latest salvo against the Clinton
administration's handling of military matters. He said cuts in
research and development spending over the last eight years have
undermined the U.S. military's ability to respond to future
threats.
</P>
<P>
   With Buzz Aldrin and other veterans of America's space program
looking on, Cheney contrasted the era that produced aviators with
''the right stuff'' with a military weakened by
Clinton-administration budget cuts.
</P>
<P>
   ''These individuals had the right stuff but they also had the
right support, the best equipment, the best training,'' Cheney
said, citing such heroes as Chuck Yeager, who broke the sound
barrier at nearby Edwards Air Force Base.
</P>
<P>
   In front of Cheney sat Aldrin, who in 1969 became the second
human to set foot on the moon; Dick Rutan, who piloted the Space
Shuttle Voyager; and Gordon Fullerton, commander of the Space
Shuttle Challenger. Cheney called them ''American heroes.''

   Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush has proposed
spending $20 billion more for weapons research and development over
five years, and $1 billion more a year over the period for a
military pay raise, giving the average soldier $750 more in the
first year.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic rival Al Gore has proposed boosting military spending
by $100 billion over 10 years. A spokesman rejected Cheney's
criticisms about the lack of military readiness.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are definitely the same recycled charges by Bush and
Cheney that have been explicitly refuted by the Joint Chiefs, the
Pentagon and their own defense advisers,'' said Gore spokesman
Jeremy Bash. ''The fact is that the Gore-Lieberman defense plan
invests more than twice as much as the Bush-Cheney plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheney also was attending events in California to raise $820,000
for the state GOP before flying to New Mexico and Arkansas.

<HEADLINE> Report: Lending Practices Slacken  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Risky loans banks made to U.S. businesses have
more than doubled in two years -- to $100 billion -- prompting
worries that banks are loosening their credit standards too much as
they joust for market share, according to a federal report released
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, prepared by the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency, said consumer lending standards have also slackened in
such areas as home-equity loans, as the percentage of consumer debt
held in those is at a five year-high.
</P>
<P>
   ''We remain quite concerned about the high levels of ... credit
risk on the books of some banks as a result of relaxed underwriting
and risk selections in prior years,'' John D. Hawke Jr., the
comptroller of the currency, said in a statement accompanying the
report.
</P>
<P>
   He said the OCC is also ''apprehensive'' about an increase in
highly leveraged lending, ''and the frequency with which these
activities are being undertaken without adequate analysis and risk
management systems at some banks.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal regulators worry that the combinations of these forces
could find banks unprepared for losses if the economy droops. That
could mean businesses would be unable to renegotiate their loan
terms and consumers would be more exposed to bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
   The $100 billion in troubled business loans represents 5.1
percent of commercial loans surveyed -- ones of $20 million or more
made by three or more banks. The loans totaled $45 billion, or 2.5
percent, in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The survey also found that:
</P>
<P>
   --More banks loosened commercial loan standards in 2000, 16
percent versus the 13 percent that loosened standards in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   --Many types of loans that make up a large chunk of credit risk
''have experienced little or no tightening during the past six
years.''
</P>
<P>
   --For the fifth straight year, the level of credit risk in bank
portfolios increased. ''This was true for almost every lending
product,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   --Competition and market strategy were the most frequent reasons
given for easing underwriting standards.
</P>
<P>
   The sixth annual survey of lending practices covered the 69
largest national banks, whose combined loans total $1.9 trillion,
89 percent of national bank loans.

<HEADLINE> Track and Swimming Headline for NBC  </HEADLINE>
By HAL BOCK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- For the first time in these Olympics,
the two marquee sports of the games -- track and swimming -- will
make up the bulk of NBC's primetime television schedule Friday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Track competition begins Friday (Thursday EDT) and swimming ends
Saturday (Friday EDT) so the sports have just two days of
competition overlapping each other. That means NBC gets a full
plate of big names from both sports for Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   From the track, Marion Jones begins her quest for five gold
medals, running preliminary heats of the women's 100-meter dash,
and Maurice Greene, the world's fastest man after lowering the
100-meter record to 9.79 seconds, gets started in his showcase
race.
</P>
<P>
   There are four finals set for the Aquatic Center -- the women's
800 freestyle, where American Brooke Bennett is the defending gold
medalist, the men's 50 freestyle with Russian Alexander Popov
resuming his personal battle with American Gary Hall Jr., the
women's 200 backstroke and the men's 100 butterfly.
</P>
<P>
   Also on NBC's Friday night primetime schedule are the men's shot
put and 20-kilometer walk from the track, women's platform diving
from the pool and the women's trampoline final in gymnastics. Late
night coverage includes the United States vs. Australia in women's
volleyball and the men's final in weightlifting.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC has the United States vs. New Zealand in softball, rowing
semifinals, men's beach volleyball and the finals in women's super
heavyweight weightlifting. Boxing continues on CNBC, which also
will show the United States women vs. New Zealand in basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Greene missed the 1996 Olympics at Atlanta and has made Sydney
his compulsion ever since. At Athens in 1999, he lowered Donovan
Bailey's world record for the 100 from 9.84 seconds to 9.79 and
then punctuated that time with a 9.80 at the world championships,
where he also won the 200 and anchored America's gold medal 400
relay team.
</P>
<P>
   He faces a strong field at the Olympics including training
partner Ato Bolden of Trinidad and Tobago. Bailey of Canada, the
defending champion in the 100, has made a remarkable recovery from
a ruptured Achilles tendon two years ago and teammate Bruny Surin
has matched his 9.84 time for the distance.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is entered in five events at Sydney -- the 100, 200, long
jump, 400-meter relay and 1,600 relay. She is the world champion in
the 100, and saw her task become simpler when top rival Inger
Miller pulled out of the event because of a hamstring injury.
</P>
<P>
   She pulled up with a back injury during the 100 at the world
championships and missed the rest of the 1999 season, but has come
back to be a heavy multi-medal favorite at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   In the pool, Bennett is strongly favored to defend the 800
freestyle gold medal she won in Atlanta when two-time gold medalist
Janet Evens finished sixth. Her time of 8:23.92 at the Olympic
trials was the fastest in the world at that distance since 1989.
Kaitlin Sandeno gives the United States another strong entrant in
the event.
</P>
<P>
   Popov and Hall are longtime rivals and have staged some riveting
races. Most memorable, perhaps, was the duel in the pool at Atlanta
where the Russian touched first, becoming the only man in history
to win the Olympic 50 freestyle twice. Complicating the rematch is
Pieta van den Hoogenband, the Flying Dutchman, who tied his own
world record winning the 200 freestyle and broke the world mark in
the 100 freestyle semifinals.
</P>
<P>
   Hall, who has diabetes, had to cut back on his training for a
while after the long trip from the United States caused his blood
sugar levels to fluctuate. American Anthony Ervin could be a factor
in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Spain's Nina Zhivanevskaya is favored in the 200 backstroke with
Japanese swimmers Tomoko Hagiwara and Miki Nakao expected to
challenge. Americans Amanda Adkins and Lindsay Benko are outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Australian Michael Klim, already part of two relay wins, goes
for another gold in the men's 100 butterfly with Sweden's Lars
Frolander and Australian Geoff Huegill also expected to be factors.

<HEADLINE> Laker Guard Fisher Has Foot Surgery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. (AP) -- Los Angeles Lakers reserve guard Derek
Fisher had foot surgery Wednesday and is expected to be sidelined
for six months.
</P>
<P>
   The operation to repair a stress fracture in Fisher's right foot
was successful, Lakers spokesman John Black said.
</P>
<P>
   Fisher might be able to rejoin the defending NBA champion Lakers
by March or April, just before they would open the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   A fourth-year pro, Fisher averaged 6.3 points and 2.8 assists
last season. He played in 78 games, averaging 23.1 minutes.

<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- Clint Mathis scored two second-half goals as New
York-New Jersey beat Dallas 2-1 Wednesday night, giving the
MetroStars their first ever postseason series victory.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis, who has 14 career goals against the Burn, broke a
scoreless tie in the 53rd minute of the MLS quarterfinal series
game with assists from Ron Myers and Adolfo Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   He scored again, unassisted, in the 80th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to give plenty of credit to our players who played very
well tonight to walk off this field with the victory,'' MetroStars
coach Octavio Zambrano said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clint was on fire against the Burn, while Paul Grafer made
several solid saves. It is now time to think about the semifinals,
which will be very tough no matter who we have to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Burn's only score came on a penalty kick by Jorge Rodriguez
in the 82nd minute.
</P>
<P>
   New York-New Jersey beat Dallas 2-1 in overtime on Friday night
on Valencia's 100th-minute goal. The first team to five points
advances, with the MetroStars getting six points for two victories.
</P>
<P>
   The MetroStars will face either Chicago or New England in the
MLS semifinals. The decisive Game 3 of that series will be Friday
night in Chicago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Ruben Sierra hit a tiebreaking single in the
12th inning Wednesday night and the Texas Rangers beat the
Minnesota Twins 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra singled and scored on Scott Sheldon's homer in the ninth,
tying it at 3. Both teams scored a run in the 11th.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Alicea and Frank Catalanotto drew walks from Travis Miller
(1-3) in the Texas 12th and Sierra singled with one out.
Catalanotto later scored on a double steal.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra began the game 4-for-25 with one RBI since being called
up from the minors.
</P>
<P>
   John Wetteland (6-5) was the winning pitcher despite blowing his
ninth save chance of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Ricky Ledee led off the Texas 11th with a double off LaTroy
Hawkins. After Sheldon sacrificed, Chad Curtis hit a go-ahead
single.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins made it 4-all in the bottom half when Cristian Guzman
hit his 20th triple of the season and scored on Luis Rivas'
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Sheldon's tying homer in the ninth came off Eddie Guardado. It
was Guardado's first blown save in 10 chances this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Twins took a 3-1 lead in the sixth inning on an RBI single
by Torii Hunter and a sacrifice fly by Chad Moeller.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota went up 1-0 on an RBI single by Hunter in the fourth
off Doug Davis. Ledee hit an RBI single in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota starter J.C. Romero, who had give up 22 earned runs in
his previous 21 innings, allowed one run and five hits in seven
innings. He had a career-high eight strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Twins manager Tom Kelly has matched a team record by using
17 rookies this season, but is likely to turn more to his veterans
for upcoming series against contenders Chicago and Cleveland.
''We're going to put the best nine guys we have out there,'' Kelly
said. ''I owe that to their managers.'' ... Rivas, a rookie 2B, has
a hit in each of his five games since being called up from Triple-A
Salt Lake City. He is 8-for-22 (.364). ... Hunter, who had two
singles, is 15-for-40 in his last 11 games.

<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- The Colorado Rapids and Kansas City Wizards tied
0-0 Wednesday night, forcing a third game in their MLS quarterfinal
playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   The third game will be Sunday night in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado, which lost the series opener 1-0 last Saturday, broke
a six-game playoff losing streak dating to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams pressed hard in the final minutes. Wizards goalkeeper
Tony Meola cleared Colorado's Jorge Dely Valdes' shot in the 88th
minute with a sliding kick save.
</P>
<P>
   Rapids goalkeeper David Kramer cleared a shot in the 90th minute
by Preki Radosavljevic from inside the 6-yard box.
</P>
<P>
   With a 4-1 series lead based on three points for the win and one
for the tie, a victory or a tie Sunday would allow the Wizards to
advance to the semifinals under MLS rules.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado would have to win Game 3 and a subsequent 20-minute
mini-game to advance.

<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER (AP) -- Dave Magadan and Mike Darr each had four RBIs as
the San Diego Padres scored a season-high 15 runs in a 15-11 rout
of the struggling Colorado Rockies Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   John Mabry, a career .494 hitter (40-for-81) at Coors Field,
went 3-for-4 with a homer and single. Magadan, 20-for-34 in
September, had a three-run homer for the Padres.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Eaton (6-3), worked the first six innings, allowing five
runs and six hits in winning for the first time in four starts.
Heathcliff Slocumb walked the first four batters in the ninth
before Trevor Hoffman got three outs for his 41st save.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Rose (4-3), who hadn't lost since Aug. 23, lasted two
innings, allowing six runs and five hits. Butch Huskey homered and
had two RBIs and Ben Petrick drove in three runs for the Rockies
who extended their losing streak to five games.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres led 6-0 after two innings, batting around in the
first inning. Ryan Klesko, Mabry and Darr all had RBI singles.
</P>
<P>
   Klesko drew a four-pitch two-out walk in the second and scored
on a double to left by Magadan. One pitch later Mabry homered over
the wall in right.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado scored twice in the second inning with Eaton issuing
one-out walks to Todd Walker and Todd Hollandsworth ahead of an RBI
double by Huskey and a run-scoring ground out by Petrick.
</P>
<P>
   Magadan hit a three-run homer and Ben Davis a two-run shot in
the fourth inning off reliever Giovanni Carrara gave San Diego an
11-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Petrick's sacrifice fly in the fourth made it 11-3, but Darr hit
a bases loaded triple in the San Diego fifth off Pete Walker to
increase their lead to 14-3.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Cirillo's two-run double keyed a four-run eighth inning to
get Colorado within 15-9.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Teams Win in Beach Volleyball  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- There may soon be another Olympic medal
in the Johnson family, this one from beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis rallied with a
nine-point run to defeat Cuba's Dalixia Fernandez and Tamara Larrea
15-9 and reach the quarterfinals Thursday (Wednesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the tournament's third-seeded women's team set up
a quarterfinal match against Japan's Yukiko Takahashi and Teru
Saiki, who outclassed a Czech team in a 15-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   America's other entry, fourth-seeded Holly McPeak and Misty May,
also advanced on Thursday with a tense 15-13 victory over Daniela
Gattelli and Lucilla Perrotta of Italy. May and McPeak's
quarterfinal opponent will be the winner of a later match pitting
Brazil's fifth-seeded Sandra Pires and Adriana Samuel against Maria
Schuller and Ana Pereira of Portugal.
</P>
<P>
   Before a sellout crowd that included Chelsea Clinton and Rafer
Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon champion and Jordan's father,
Jordan and Davis started tentatively against the Cubans and fell
behind 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then the crowd began a ''U-S-A'' chant and both players became
more aggressive, blasting aces and taking control at the net. Cuba
led 9-6 after 23 minutes before Jordan and Davis scored the nine
straight points and ended the match on a Jordan slam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know exactly what happened,'' Jordan said. ''For me,
it was just going for it, to stop being tentative. I was being
aggressive but not smart. I started trying to be aggressive and
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father said the tough first-round match for Jordan and Davis
-- a 15-13 victory over an Australian team in front of a screaming
crowd -- prepared them for the adversity they faced early against
the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what it's all about,'' Johnson said. ''I really believe
that any team here can beat any other team. You need a little good
fortune, a good bounce here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrea said she and Fernandez were excited to hold a 9-6 lead,
but were unable to handle the Americans after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the score got equal (at 9-9), then things got tough,''
she said through an interpreter. ''These two American girls played
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the beach volleyball competition began
Saturday at Bondi Beach, scattered clouds blocked the sun at times
and a few showers dampened the crowd in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the patches of gray, hopeful fans scrounged for tickets
outside the stadium for what has been among the most popular
Olympic events with its beach culture, complete with bikinis and
constant music to prompt dancing and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   The skies cleared for the afternoon matches, which began with
May and McPeak jumping out to leads of 2-0, 8-5 and 12-7 before the
Italians fought back behind Perrotta's strong serving to 13-11.
McPeak then blocked Gattelli to make it 14-11, but a Perrotta ace
and desperate lunge shot out of the reach of McPeak made it 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   Only on their seventh serve for the match did McPeak and May get
the final point, with May slamming a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Davis started slowly, making errors and failing to
react in allowing the Cubans the 6-2 lead. Three aces -- two by
Jordan and one by Davis -- brought the Americans back to 6-5, but
the Cubans kept up the pressure, with Larrea blocking Jordan for a
point and strong defense getting the side out when the Americans
served.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton arrived and the ''U-S-A'' chant began, Davis and
Jordan started their run with another Davis ace as the crowd roared
its approval. A Cuban contingent chanted ''Cuba'' from the stands,
but Larrea and Fernandez crumbled under der the pressure, making
errors that kept the Jordan-Davis run going until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if playing the Americans had any special significance,
Fernandez said she was an athlete, not a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political situation has nothing to do with it,'' she said,
also through an interpreter. ''We are sportswomen. Our aim is
competing to win. Perhaps we needed an extra push in the last match
today.''
</P>
<P>
   In other matches, sixth-seeded Takahashi and Saiki served seven
aces in their victory over Sona Dosoudilova and Eva Celbova of the
Czech Republic to set up the quarterfinal date with Jordan and
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Bruschini and Annamaria Solazzi of Italy extended their
perfect record against Germany's Ulrike Schmidt and Gudula Staub by
jumping to a 10-1 lead and holding off a persistent comeback for a
15-12 victory.
</P>
<P>
   Australia's Tania Gooley and Pauline Manser swamped Anabelle
Prawerman and Cecile Rigaux of France, 15-3.
</P>
<P>
   The men's competition for quarterfinal berths is Friday.

<HEADLINE> Runner Perec Won't Compete  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Marie-Jose Perec, the mystery woman of
the Sydney Olympics, now has completely disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Perec, two-time defending champion in the 400 meters and a
potential threat to favorite Cathy Freeman in the 400 at the Sydney
Games, left the country one day before Friday's first-round heats
in the event. She said she was threatened in her hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   French Olympic officials said they were told by the French
Embassy in Canberra that Perec had left for Singapore.
</P>
<P>
   ''She hasn't been officially excluded from the team,'' said
Michel Vial, head of the French delegation. ''The team still hopes
she can come to compete in Sydney. At this point, being in
Singapore, it is very improbable that she will compete. But she is
still officially entered. Things are possible with planes.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Kaigler, spokeswoman for Perec's chief sponsor, Reebok,
said earlier that Perec would not compete in the games. She later
said it was possible Perec would compete.
</P>
<P>
   ''Marie-Jose has been under a great deal of pressure and
yesterday afternoon she was harassed in her hotel room by an
unidentified man who forced his way into her room and threatened
her,'' Kaigler said.
</P>
<P>
   Perec, 32, had been a mystery woman in Sydney, where she refused
to train with the French team and hid from reporters. Her only
public appearance was her arrival at the Sydney Airport, where she
sprinted past cameramen.
</P>
<P>
   She has been so reclusive that the Australian media labeled her
the ''Greta Garbo of athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   Vial said Perec had been staying at the Grand Mercure Apartments
in downtown Sydney. A spokeswoman for New South Wales police said
no report had been received about harassment at that location, and
the general manager of the complex said staff members were unaware
of any attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is an extremely high-security complex, and only guests with
the appropriate technology are able to gain access beyond the
reception area,'' general manager Robert Murray said.
</P>
<P>
   Vial said nobody in the French delegation had spoken to Perec in
three or four days.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a shame that she was not able to become part of the
delegation at our training camp or at the Olympic village,'' he
said. ''Maybe she made a bad decision by not staying in the
village, where she would have been more secure.''
</P>
<P>
   Perec, who became only the second woman in Olympic history to
sweep the 200 and 400 when she accomplished that feat in Atlanta,
also was the 400-meter champion at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman has not lost at 400 meters in more than three years but
has lost seven of her nine career races against Perec. She was not
talking to reporters Thursday. But Australian track and field coach
Chris Wardlaw said Perec probably wasn't ready to run.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think if she's not here she obviously wasn't in shape, so it
wouldn't have been a great race anyway,'' Wardlaw said. ''She's the
athlete of the decade in the '90s, a truly great athlete, and
obviously in her mind she wasn't going to be able to compete up to
that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Perec, nicknamed ''The Gazelle'' because of her fluid,
long-legged running style, won the 1996 Atlanta Games gold in 48.25
seconds -- an Olympic record. But she has not won a 400-meter race
since then.
</P>
<P>
   Before her one 400-meter race this summer, in which she placed
third, Perec said a comeback would be difficult.
</P>
<P>
   ''You don't stop running the 400 for four years without
experiencing a certain amount of apprehension. I have to admit I'm
scared,'' she said. ''After the Barcelona Olympics in 1992, I went
two years without running the 400. I still remember my return in
New York in 1995. It was hard. But now I'm expecting the worst.''
</P>
<P>
   Perec has been tormented by Epstein Barr syndrome, a rare virus
that causes chronic fatigue, and dropped out of three races this
summer in Europe that would have pitted her against Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Perec's only public comments have come on her web site. On
Tuesday, she wrote that her training was going well but that she
was scared.
</P>
<P>
   ''The games have hardly begun and already I wish they would end
because I'm so scared,'' she wrote. ''I simply have to make sure my
training place stays secret. That's the main thing, is to stay
relaxed.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- With buses and trains idled by a strike, the
area's working poor are finding their own solution: private cars
whose owners charge a few dollars for a ride along the same routes
abandoned by buses.
</P>
<P>
   The grass-roots shuttle network saved thousands of people from
walking to work or not getting there at all.
</P>
<P>
   Raquel Ortega, 30, found a ride in a private van after walking
2&AMP;frac12; hours Wednesday morning toward her job in a T-shirt factory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've got to work,'' said the single mother of four. ''If not,
we starve to death.''
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Transportation Authority and the union
representing striking bus drivers and rail operators spent 10 hours
in negotiations Wednesday and plan to resume talks on Friday. Both
sides said some agreement was reached on secondary issues but that
key economic points, including benefits and wages, remained.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're anxious to settle this,'' said MTA spokesman Marc
Littman, expressing disappointment that no negotiations would be
held Thursday because union officials plan to participate in a
support rally. ''We'll be back here at the table whenever they want
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldy Norton, spokesman for the United Transportation Union,
representing bus drivers and train operators said: ''The parties
did get some things accomplished. But we didn't get to the big
ones.''
</P>
<P>
   The director of the state Department of Industrial relations, a
member of Gov. Gray Davis' cabinet, was attending the meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The walkout, which began Saturday, has halted most public
transit in a 1,400-square-mile area and affected some 450,000
commuters, including many of the region's poorest residents.
</P>
<P>
   On average, bus and rail riders earn $15,000 a year, according
to MTA. Most don't own cars and have been forced to walk, ride
bicycles, hitchhike or arrange other rides.
</P>
<P>
   So, many are relying on the steady stream of cars and vans
pulling up to bus stops offering rides for $2 to $6 each way.
That's steep for a worker making California's minimum wage of $5.75
an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The rides-for-hire trade is illegal -- charging a fare requires a
special license and insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers caught doing it risk having their vehicles impounded and
face a $1,000 fine or a six-month jail term, said Robert Johnson,
senior investigator with the city Department of Transportation.
</P>
<P>
   ''We probably saw 100 to 150'' within an hour on Tuesday, he
said. ''You can go to just about any bus stop. It's so much that
... we can't curtail the problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Police reported no arrests as of Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Geraldo Pacheco, 41, began offering rides in his battered 1986
Dodge Ram van on Saturday. He said he makes about $40 a day --
spending half on gas -- for about four hours of driving that begins
at 6 a.m. Then he heads to a $250-a-week job as a driver picking up
sewing machine parts for a downtown business.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm worried for me because I need a little bit of money,''
said the father of three. ''I'm worried for the people because they
need transportation.''
</P>
<P>
   On his last trip Wednesday, Pacheco picked up five turbaned
Sikhs visiting from India. For $2 each, he took them to the beach
at Santa Monica, an hour-long drive that would have cost $25 to $30
in a cab.
</P>
<P>
   Yogi Singh, 23, joked about the inconvenience caused by the
strike.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is like India,'' he said. ''Nobody knows when the bus is
coming.''

   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The remaining eight Cuban survivors of a plane crash
in the Gulf of Mexico were brought to Key West for medical evaluation Wednesday.
A ninth survivor was already being treated at a Key West hospital for head and

<HEADLINE> Mystery in Women's 400-Meter Race  </HEADLINE>
By ROB GLOSTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- With the race still 24 hours away, the
women's 400 meters already is tangled in mystery and intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   It was enough to have the unflappable master of the men's 400,
Michael Johnson, scratching his head.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson is a clear favorite in the men's event, which he has
dominated for the past decade. But the women's race was to be the
stage for a showdown between Australian Cathy Freeman, the star of
the torch-lighting ceremony, and two-time defending Olympic
champion Marie-Jose Perec.
</P>
<P>
   Perec, vilified in the Australian media and a mystery in terms
of her fitness, abruptly left the country after she said a man
forced his way into her hotel room and threatened her. French
officials said they have not withdrawn her from the competition but
she was unlikely to compete.
</P>
<P>
   Perec has run only one 400 in the past four years -- and she
placed third in that race.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman won the last two world championships at 400 meters and
went into the Olympics with a three-year winning streak. But Perec
holds a 7-2 career mark against Freeman in head-to-head races,
including the 1996 Olympic final.
</P>
<P>
   Perec suffers from Epstein Barr syndrome, a rare virus that
causes chronic fatigue, and dropped out of three races this summer
in Europe that would have pitted her against Freeman.
</P>
<P>
   Perec has refused to train with the French team and has been so
reclusive the Australian media have labeled her the ''Greta Garbo
of athletics.''
</P>
<P>
   The French team asked Johnson to come to their training camp
outside Sydney, hoping that would encourage Perec to join them, but
she still refused. Johnson had said he had no idea whether Perec
would be ready to run when the heats of the women's 400 start
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably just as much a mystery to me as it is to
everybody else. I think it's making the women's 400 meters very
interesting'' said Johnson, whose first-round race also is Friday
(Thursday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''We all know that (Perec) has got a tremendous amount of
talent. I think it puts Cathy in a very difficult position where
you don't know exactly what to expect. We know that she's got the
talent, we just don't know what kind of shape she's in because she
hasn't run a lot of races.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Perec both swept the 200 and 400 races in Atlanta,
but neither will be defending the 200 title in Sydney. Johnson
failed to qualify at that distance when he limped out of the 200
final at the U.S. trials.
</P>
<P>
   But while Johnson has maintained his supremacy at 400 meters,
winning his fourth consecutive world championship in a world-record
43.18 seconds last year, Freeman has clearly surpassed Perec as the
top woman at that distance.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman, who won silver at the 1996 Atlanta Games, has been
nearly unbeatable since then. Perec, who also captured gold in the
400 at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics and was the world champion at
that distance in 1991 and 1995, mostly has avoided the track.
</P>
<P>
   Freeman had said she can envision what it would be like to face
Perec, and six other women, in the 400 final on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Your heart is racing. It feels like your heart is about to
jump out of your chest,'' she said. ''There's this big jelly thing
full of color and noise that's going on around you and all I see is
my lane in front of me.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's something you only experience before an Olympic race,''
Freeman added. ''You have to find the balance between being ready
to go and being at peace with yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said he hopes to cap his Olympic career with another
400-meter gold medal and to lower the world record again. But he
fears his accomplishments may be overshadowed by the women's race.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's unfortunate that we're running right after they are,''
Johnson complained. ''Probably nobody will want to watch our
race.''

<HEADLINE> White Sox 13, Tigers 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT (AP) -- Paul Konerko drove in a career-high five runs and
Ray Durham hit a grand slam to lead the Chicago White Sox to a 13-6
rain-delayed win over the Detroit Tigers on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox reduced their magic number for winning the AL
Central title to six over Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   The game was delayed twice: for 1 hour, 22 minutes, before it
started and 1 hour, 29 minutes, in the first inning. It didn't
finish until 12:56 a.m. Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Konerko hit a three-run double in a six-run third and a two-run
homer in the ninth to finish the rout.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Higginson's solo homer in the third and a two-run shot by
Dean Palmer in the seventh got the Tigers within 7-5.
</P>
<P>
   But Durham hit his third career grand slam off Matt Anderson to
put the game out of reach in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Jon Garland (4-7), who lost his last three starts, allowed three
runs and six hits in six innings. Garland, vying for a spot in the
postseason rotation, won for only the second time in his last seven
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Moehler (12-9) lost his second straight decision after
winning his previous six. He gave up seven runs and seven hits in 2
1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit led 2-1 when Charles Johnson led off the third with his
29th homer. A hit and a walk set up an RBI single from Magglio
Ordonez, and after Carlos Lee's single loaded the bases, Konerko
cleared them with a drive up the right field gap that finished
Moehler. Herbert Perry's single off Willie Blair made it 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   In a downpour that began as the Tigers took the field, Durham
led off the first with a triple to the left-center gap. He scored
when Frank Thomas' catchable fly ball fell between right fielder
Rich Becker and center fielder Juan Encarnacion for a single.
</P>
<P>
   The Tigers went ahead in the second on an RBI groundout from
Damion Easley and a bases-loaded walk to Becker.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Tigers closer Todd Jones spent part of the first-inning
delay tossing packets of sunflower seeds and baseballs to fans
behind the Detroit dugout. He also handed a bat to a young boy and
finished the gift-giving by throwing his cap into the stands. ...
The White Sox won the season series from Detroit, 9-3. ... There
were 28,422 tickets sold but only a few hundred fans in the stands
when the game ended.

<HEADLINE> Knicks Send Ewing To Sonics  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing's 15-year career with the Knicks ended Wednesday
night when New York sent him to Seattle in a four-team, 12-player
trade also involving the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks sent Ewing to the SuperSonics and received Glen Rice
from the Lakers and Luc Longley from the Suns. Among the other
major players moving were Horace Grant from Seattle to Los Angeles
and Chris Dudley from New York to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became clear that he was looking for a change and when he
requested a trade, we respected his request,'' Knicks general
manager Scott Layden said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was important in doing so, however, that we had the ability
to add value, and we believe we have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Various trades involving Ewing and Rice have been in the works
for the past month, including one involving Detroit that fell apart
at the last moment in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, Lakers and Sonics then discussed a three-team deal,
but the Knicks wouldn't pull the trigger because they felt they
weren't getting enough in return.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Suns entered the picture, the talks heated up again.
</P>
<P>
   Several other players were included in the trade to make it work
under league salary cap guidelines. The Knicks got Vernon Maxwell,
Vladimir Stepania and Lazaro Borrell from Seattle and Travis Knight
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   New York also got first-round draft picks in 2001 from the
Lakers and Sonics, and two second-round picks in 2001 from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also get Greg Foster, Chuck Person and Emanuel Davis
from Seattle. Phoenix gets the Knicks' No. 1 pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting Patrick accomplishes a big offseason goal of ours,''
said Sonics general manager Wally Walker, adding that 48 trade
scenarios were discussed between the Sonics, Knicks and Lakers.
''Until we got on the conference call with the league this
afternoon, I had no confidence that the deal would get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a free agent, received a one-year offer from the Chicago
Bulls this week. But he wavered on signing it as his agent, David
Falk, tried to broker another deal, and the Bulls finally pulled
the offer off the table Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rice ended up with the Knicks as part of a sign-and-trade
transaction in which he got a multiyear contract from the Lakers
before being shipped immediately to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The trade brings a close to Ewing's career in New York, where he
arrived as the No. 1 pick in the 1985 draft. He was expected to be
the type of franchise player who could bring the Knicks their first
championship since 1973, but it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Sonics have a center who can help them compete with the
better teams in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Patrick's going to come and add us something that we
needed, We needed someone to cope with the Rasheed Wallaces and the
Shaquille O'Neals,'' Seattle's Gary Payton said. ''We hope this is
going to help Vin come back to the player he wants to be. I know
Patrick's going to help our scoring, and it should open up things
for me because a lot of people are young to be worried about
doubling Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's only appearance in the NBA Finals came in 1994 when the
Knicks lost to Houston in seven games. The Knicks made it back to
the finals in 1999, but Ewing was injured and did not play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patrick is one the hardest working, most loyal players I have
ever been around,'' New York coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have told him more than once that he is a champion even if
he hasn't won a championship. He practiced and played like a
champion every day he was here. Seattle is fortunate to get a
player of his talent and character.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has one year remaining on a four-year, $60 million
contract and has said he would like to play two more years beyond
this upcoming season. The Knicks expressed no interest in giving
Ewing an extension, and they started exploring the possibility of
trading him earlier this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing has a no-trade clause in his contract, but said he would
waive it if he was traded to a team of his liking. He met with
Walker in August when the first four-team trade was discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ''There were many times we thought the deal was completely dead,
but it got resurrected and here we are,'' Walker said. ''We feel
great about it. The trade is not without risk given Patrick's age
and injury history. But he's still one of the top half-dozen
players in game.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it doesn't work out, we'll have some cap flexibility next
summer.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sonics, Ewing will take over the starting spot at
center that was manned by Grant and Vin Baker.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA champion Lakers, who were on the verge of losing Rice on
the free-agent market and getting nothing in return, come out
looking like the big winners. Grant fills their void at power
forward, while Rick Fox will presumably replace Rice in the
starting lineup
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks received six players and four draft picks for a
38-year-old center with bad knees and a surgically repaired wrist.
But they no longer have a top caliber center, and they have a glut
at small forward and shooting guard with Rice, Allan Houston,
Latrell Sprewell, Erick Strickland and Maxwell.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously in losing Patrick you lose one of the most dominant
centers to ever play,'' said Allan Houston of the Knicks.
''Hopefully he's happy personally with it.''
</P>
<P>
   The trade was only the second four-team deal in NBA history, and
Walker said a five-team deal was discussed at one point.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think most people know how complex four- and five-team
deals are, and how many moving parts are involved,'' Lakers general
manager Mitch Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of things happened this summer you can't explain -- deals
falling apart, players we thought we had commitments from. This
deal made sense. I really felt if it didn't happen, it would be a
shame. I'm relieved.''

<HEADLINE> Lakers Deal Rice, Pickup Grant  </HEADLINE>
By KEN PETERS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Glen Rice is gone, and Horace Grant is coming
to town.
</P>
<P>
   Finally completing a sign-and-trade deal for Rice, the defending
NBA champion Los Angeles Lakers acquired Grant and three others
from Seattle in a four-team, 12-player deal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After watching several deals unravel, Lakers general manager
Mitch Kupchak was pleased to finally close one.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of things happened this summer you can't explain -- deals
falling apart, players we thought we had commitments from. This
deal made sense. I really felt if it didn't happen, it would be a
shame,'' Kupchak said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no secret that the Glen Rice question has loomed over our
heads now since the season ended and even prior to that, an issue
we hoped would been a lot smoother. I'm relieved. I know our
coaching staff is relieved as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a free agent who got a multiyear contract from the Lakers
just before being dealt to New York, turned down an offer from
Chicago earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also sent Travis Knight to the Knicks in the deal,
which revolved around New York's trading Patrick Ewing to Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 35-year-old Grant, a 6-foot-10 power forward
who will be reunited with coach Phil Jackson, Los Angeles acquired
journeymen Greg Foster, Chuck Person and Emanual Davis from
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's apparent we needed help in the front court and I don't
think there's a better player out there to help us than Horace
Grant,'' Kupchak said during a conference call. ''He's a true power
forward, is experienced, is experienced with Phil, he knows how to
win and he's won.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there's a true power forward in the league, it's Horace
Grant.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers released forward A.C. Green shortly after the season
ended. Their only other significant offseason move before the big
trade was to sign free-agent Isaiah Rider.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak said Grant will be a welcome addition to the Lakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bumped into Shaquille (O'Neal) a little while back and he
was so quick to say, 'Go get him,' I was surprised,'' the Lakers'
GM said. ''Phil and I had talked about it for five weeks, so he's
very comfortable.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the deal was about to happen, I called him away from
someone he was talking to and said, 'Phil, do you really want this
guy.' He said, 'Yeah, I really do.'''
</P>
<P>
   Grant, a 13-year pro, won three NBA championship rings with
Jackson in Chicago in the early 1990s. He played his first seven
seasons with the Bulls, then was with Orlando in 1994-99.
</P>
<P>
   Last season, his first with Seattle, Grant led the SuperSonics
in rebounding with an average of 7.8, and averaged 8.1 points.
</P>
<P>
   He has averaged 12.1 points and 6.8 rebounds in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Kupchak said Grant could not be expected to play many years with
the Lakers, but ''If we could get two or three good years out of
him, he would be happy and so would we.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster is a 6-11 center-forward who has played 10 NBA seasons,
averaging 4.1 points and 2.6 rebounds. Davis, a 6-5 guard who has
played three seasons, has averaged 4.2 points, 1.5 rebounds and 1.4
assists. Person, a 6-8 forward, is a 14-year pro who has averaged
5.1 rebounds and 2.8 assists.
</P>
<P>
   In the deal, the Knicks also got Luc Longley from Phoenix and
Lazaro Borrell, Vladimir Stepania and Vernon Maxwell from Seattle.
Phoenix received Chris Dudley from New York.
</P>
<P>
   New York also got lottery-protected first-round picks in the
next NBA draft from Los Angeles and Seattle, as well as two
second-round choices from Seattle. Phoenix received a first-round,
lottery-protected pick from New York, and an undisclosed amount of
cash.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Luis Hernandez had a goal and three
assists as the Los Angeles Galaxy beat the Tampa Bay Mutiny 5-2
Wednesday night to win an MLS quarterfinal playoff series.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles won two straight games in the best-of-3 series to
reach the semifinals for the fourth time in the club's five-year
history. The Galaxy will face either Kansas City or Colorado in the
best-of-3 semifinals. The Wizards lead that series with a victory
and a tie, with Game 3 at Kansas City on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Ezra Hendrickson scored in the 14th minute as the Galaxy scored
the game's first two goals at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   After Cobi Jones forced a turnover, Mauricio Cienfuegos quickly
passed the loose ball to Hendrickson. Defender Steve Trittschuh
bumped Hendrickson from behind, but Hendrickson's 15-yard shot
rolled inside the left post.
</P>
<P>
   In the 19th minute, Brian Kelly extended the lead to 2-0.
Hernandez chipped the ball to Simon Elliott on a give-and-go.
Defender Ritchie Kotschau pulled Elliott down from behind just as
Elliott passed to Kelly, who converted a shot from five yards.
</P>
<P>
   Mamadou Diallo, the league's leading goal scorer, scored both of
Tampa Bay's goals, the first in the 21st minute with a powerful
19-yard shot. Teammate Dominic Kinnear almost tied the score in the
30th minute with a 29-yard free kick that goalkeeper Kevin Hartman
tipped over the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez and Cienfuegos scored goals early in the second half
to open a 4-1 lead. Hernandez chipped a ball to Cienfuegos at the
right side of the penalty area, and Cienfuegos returned a pass that
Hernandez sent into the goal from his right shin from six yards out
in the 48th minute, his first MLS playoff goal.
</P>
<P>
   Three minutes later, Cienfuegos scored off another Hernandez
chip. Diallo scored in the 67th minute, then Hernandez assisted on
a goal by Jones in the 85th minute.

<HEADLINE> Giants 4, Reds 2  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Barry Bonds' 493rd career homer splashed
into McCovey Cove, and Russ Ortiz threw six hitless innings as the
San Francisco Giants moved to the doorstep of the NL West title by
beating the Cincinnati Reds 4-2 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants, helped by Arizona's 1-0 loss to Los Angeles,
clinched at least a tie for the division title.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds' towering solo homer into the mist and water beyond
Pacific Bell Park's right-field wall was the high point of a
celebratory night for the Giants, who can win the West with a
victory over Arizona on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The homer tied Bonds with Lou Gehrig for 17th on the majors'
career list and brought a raucous ovation from the Giants' fans.
Bonds' 48 homers this season are the most by a Giants left fielder
in the franchise's 110-year history.
</P>
<P>
   J.T. Snow drove in three runs to back Ortiz (13-11), who allowed
two hits over 6 2-3 innings to win for the eighth time in nine
decisions. Ortiz is 8-1 with a 1.92 ERA in his last 10 starts.
</P>
<P>
   Robb Nen pitched the ninth for his 38th save. He has thrown 25
2-3 consecutive scoreless innings over 27 appearances.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Parris (12-15), who like Ortiz had won seven games since
Aug. 1, allowed four runs in five innings and had his seven-game
winning streak snapped.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz didn't allow a hit, walked just one and faced the minimum
18 batters until the seventh inning. Leadoff hitter Brian Hunter
squibbed a ball up the third-base line that neither Ortiz nor
catcher Bobby Estalella could reach in time for a single.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz, who struck out eight, then hit Pokey Reese on the left
hand and surrendered a two-run double by Michael Tucker. Doug Henry
then relieved and pitched out of the jam.
</P>
<P>
   Reese sustained a bruised left hand and left the game, but
X-rays were negative.
</P>
<P>
   With Arizona coming to town for the first of eight games between
the clubs in the season's final two weeks, San Francisco can clinch
the division in style with one victory in five chances over the
next four days at Pac Bell.
</P>
<P>
   After Jeff Kent tripled in the second, Snow drove in the Giants'
first run on a groundout. Snow drove in two more runs with a
bases-loaded double in the third that scored Marvin Benard and
Bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Griffey pinch-hit in the Reds eighth and struck out against
Felix Rodriguez. On Tuesday night, Griffey hit a pinch-hit homer in
his first appearance after missing eight games with a partially
torn left hamstring.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Bonds is responsible for six of the seven homers that have
landed in McCovey Cove this season. Los Angeles' Todd Hundley is
the only other hitter to do it. ... After rounding the bases to a
raucous ovation, Bonds handed his bat to tennis great John McEnroe,
who was watching the game from a seat near the Giants' dugout.
McEnroe played tennis at nearby Stanford. ... The Giants' last
no-hitter was pitched by John Montefusco on Sept. 29, 1976. ... 1B
Sean Casey was held out of the Reds' starting lineup with a tight
right hamstring. He hurt himself sliding into home with the Reds'
first run on Tuesday night. ... Tucker made a helmet-throwing
protest after umpire Jeff Nelson called him out when he tried to
steal second in the second inning. Moments later, the crowd booed
when he caught a fly ball for the third out and then threw the ball
over the right-field wall into the water, instead of throwing it to
a fan.

<HEADLINE> Dodgers 1, Diamondbacks 0  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN NADEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Eric Karros hit a leadoff home run in the
bottom of the ninth inning Wednesday night to give the Los Angeles
Dodgers their second straight 1-0 victory over the Arizona
Diamondbacks and a sweep of the three-game series.
</P>
<P>
   Karros hit a 2-0 pitch from Byung-Hyun Kim (6-6) into the
left-field bullpen for his first homer in 29 games since Aug. 22
and 31st of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles extended its winning streak to six games, equaling a
season high. It was the third walkoff homer for the Dodgers in six
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers moved ahead of Arizona into second place in the NL
West, and remained 5&AMP;frac12; games behind the New York Mets in the NL wild
card race. The Mets have 10 games left, the Dodgers nine.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks, who have lost five in a row, are six games
behind the Mets with 12 games remaining.
</P>
<P>
   A total of just five runs were scored in the series -- Los
Angeles won Monday night's opener 2-1. Arizona hasn't scored a run
in 19 straight innings.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Herges (11-3), who blanked the Diamondbacks in the top of
the ninth despite allowing two hits, was the winner. Herges has an
11-0 record as a reliever and is 0-3 as a starter.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the first 11 Arizona batters hit singles before Dodgers
starter Darren Dreifort settled down, retiring 14 straight batters
until Kelly Stinnett hit a one-out infield single in the eighth.
Hanley Frias ran for Stinnett and was thrown out trying to steal by
Paul LoDuca.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks then loaded the bases when pinch-hitter Rob
Ryan walked, Tony Womack singled and Craig Counsell walked. Terry
Adams relieved Dreifort and struck out Luis Gonzalez to end the
threat.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson blanked the Dodgers on five hits over seven
innings while walking two and striking out eight, giving him a big
league-leading 334 strikeouts this season. He threw 125 pitches
before being lifted for a pinch-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   Dreifort went 7 2-3 innings and allowed seven hits while walking
two and striking out seven. He used 108 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Grudzielanek tripled with one out in the Los Angeles first,
but Johnson escaped trouble by striking out Shawn Green and Eric
Karros.
</P>
<P>
   Womack and Counsell hit two-out singles for Arizona in the
third, but Gonzalez lined to left to end the inning and begin
Dreifort's streak.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Dodgers slugger Gary Sheffield sat out his second straight
game and fourth in the last five because of lower back pain. It's
hoped Sheffield, who has 41 homers and 104 RBIs, will be able to
play this weekend. ... Johnson failed to reach double figures in
strikeouts for only the 10th time in 33 starts this season. He has
148 double-digit strikeout games in his career to rank second
all-time behind Nolan Ryan's 215. ... Arizona outfielder Danny
Bautista returned to the team after missing Tuesday night's game to
be with his wife, Frandy, who delivered the couple's second son and
third child in Arizona early Wednesday. Daniel Bautista Jr. weighed
7 pounds, 6 ounces at birth. ... Grudzielanek, moved from shortstop
to second base last winter, played short for the first time this
season, and Hiram Bocachica made his first big league start at
second for the Dodgers. ... Womack, who entered the game with only
two hits in 34 at-bats, went 2-for-4. ... Los Angeles starters have
pitched 24 1-3 consecutive scoreless innings.

<HEADLINE> Americans Win in Beach Volleyball  </HEADLINE>
By TOM COHEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- There may soon be another Olympic medal
in the Johnson family, this one from beach volleyball.
</P>
<P>
   Americans Jenny Johnson Jordan and Annett Davis rallied with a
nine-point run Thursday (Wednesday night EDT) to defeat Cuba's
Dalixia Fernandez and Tamara Larrea 15-9 and reach the
quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   The victory by the tournament's third-seeded women's team set up
a quarterfinal match against Japan's Yukiko Takahashi and Teru
Saiki, who outclassed a Czech team in a 15-2 victory.
</P>
<P>
   America's other entry, fourth-seeded Holly McPeak and Misty May,
also advanced Thursday with a tense 15-13 victory over Daniela
Gattelli and Lucilla Perrotta of Italy. May and McPeak now face the
fifth-seeded Brazilian tandem of Sandra Pires and Adriana Samuel,
who won a 15-6 match over Maria Schuller and Ana Pereira of
Portugal to reach the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   McPeak said she and May must play better to defeat the
Brazilians, who each won medals with different partners -- gold for
Pires, silver for Samuel -- at the inaugural Olympic beach
volleyball competition in Atlanta four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   A four-day break between their opening match Saturday and the
second-round Thursday may have contributed to a game in which,
after the first few minutes, ''I can't say we did anything well,''
McPeak said.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Davis, playing before a sellout crowd that included
Chelsea Clinton and Rafer Johnson, the 1960 Olympic decathlon
champion and Jordan's father, started tentatively against the
Cubans and fell behind 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Then the crowd began a ''U-S-A'' chant and both players became
more aggressive, blasting aces and taking control at the net. Cuba
led 9-6 after 23 minutes before Jordan and Davis scored the nine
straight points and ended the match on a Jordan slam.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't know exactly what happened,'' Jordan said. ''For me,
it was just going for it, to stop being tentative. I was being
aggressive but not smart. I started trying to be aggressive and
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father said a tough first-round match for Jordan and Davis --
a 15-13 victory over an Australian team in front of a screaming
crowd -- prepared them for the adversity they faced early against
the Cubans.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what it's all about,'' Johnson said. ''I really believe
that any team here can beat any other team. You need a little good
fortune, a good bounce here and there.''
</P>
<P>
   Larrea said she and Fernandez were excited to hold a 9-6 lead,
but were unable to handle the Americans after that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once the score got equal (at 9-9), then things got tough,''
she said through an interpreter. ''These two American girls played
very well.''
</P>
<P>
   For the first time since the beach volleyball competition began
Saturday at Bondi Beach, scattered clouds blocked the sun at times
and a few showers dampened the crowd in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the patches of gray, hopeful fans scrounged for tickets
outside the stadium for what has been among the most popular
Olympic events with its beach culture, complete with bikinis and
constant music to prompt dancing and cheering.
</P>
<P>
   The skies cleared for the afternoon matches, which began with
May and McPeak jumping out to leads of 2-0, 8-5 and 12-7 before the
Italians fought back behind Perrotta's strong serving to 13-11.
McPeak then blocked Gattelli to make it 14-11, but a Perrotta ace
and desperate lunge shot out of the reach of McPeak made it 14-13.
</P>
<P>
   Only on their seventh serve for the match did McPeak and May get
the final point, with May slamming a winner.
</P>
<P>
   Jordan and Davis started slowly, making errors and failing to
react in allowing the Cubans the 6-2 lead. Three aces -- two by
Jordan and one by Davis -- brought the Americans back to 6-5, but
the Cubans kept up the pressure, with Larrea blocking Jordan for a
point and strong defense getting the side out when the Americans
served.
</P>
<P>
   After Clinton arrived and the ''U-S-A'' chant began, Davis and
Jordan started their run with another Davis ace as the crowd roared
its approval. A Cuban contingent chanted ''Cuba'' from the stands,
but Larrea and Fernandez crumbled under der the pressure, making
errors that kept the Jordan-Davis run going until the end.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if playing the Americans had any special significance,
Fernandez said she was an athlete, not a politician.
</P>
<P>
   ''The political situation has nothing to do with it,'' she said,
also through an interpreter. ''We are sportswomen. Our aim is
competing to win. Perhaps we needed an extra push in the last match
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The men's competition for quarterfinal berths is Friday.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Michael Bennett kept U.S. boxers
unbeaten and advanced to a quarterfinal showdown with great Cuban
heavyweight Felix Savon with a victory in his Olympic debut.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Bennett, who got serious about boxing after
being released from prison July 28, 1998, after serving seven years
for armed robbery, pounded out an 11-2 decsion over Wojciech
Bartnik of Poland at 201 pounds Thursday (Wednesday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Savon, trying to join fellow Cuban Teofilo Stevenson and Lazlo
Papp of Hungary as the only men to win three Olympic boxing golds,
stopped Rasmus Ojemaye of Nigeria on the 15-point rule (18-3) with
35 seconds left in the second round.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett will box Savon in the quarterfinals Tuesday (Monday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not intimidated by any man,'' Bennett said of his upcoming
match against Savon, who has put fear into many opponents. ''You're
going to see two warriors do battle.''
</P>
<P>
   Savon would only wave to reporters after his victory.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett thought he would get a crack at Savon in the world
championships last year at Houston. But Savon pulled out in protest
over a decision that went against a Cuban in an earlier fight.
Bennett won the title on a walkover.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot Bennett, the reigning U.S. champion, chased Bartnik,
a 1996 Olympic bronze medalist at 178 pounds, for the first two
rounds and built a 5-0 lead. Two of those scoring blows came when
Bennett switch to a left-handed style for part of the second round.
Bartnik resorted to rough-house tactics to no avail in the final
two rounds. Just before the final bell, the 32-year-old Bartnik hit
Bennett hard with a shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ''I got a 'W,''' Bennett said. ''It was difficult, because he
didn't come to box.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-6 Savon, a six-time world champion who lists his age as
33, had about an eight-inch height advantange over Ojemaye, who
took two standing 8-counts. Savon, landing hard rights and stiff
left jabs, led 12-1 after one round.
</P>
<P>
   All 10 American boxers to see action have won. Yet to box are
Olanda Anderson of the Army, who drew a first-round bye at 178
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Boxing Thursday night for the second time were Clarence Vinson
of Washington, D.C., against Tallalbek Kadiraliev of Kyrgyzstan at
119 pounds and Dante Craig of Cincinnati against Bulent Ulusoy of
Turkey at 147 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans' first loss after eight wins came earlier on
Thursday's card when Dorel Simion of Romania, a 1997 world and
reigning European champion, outpointed Roberto Guerra 11-7.
</P>
<P>
   Simion, whose brother Marin, the 1996 Olympic 147-pound bronze
medalist, is fighting here at 156, wouldn't let the rangy Cuban
fight outside. The Romanian outscored Guerra 6-2 in the last two
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   In another 147-pound bout in the afternoon, Oleg Saitov of
Russia, a 1996 Olympic champion, boxed circles around Francisco
Calderon of Colombia for an 11-7 win.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- On a day of broken bones and
spectacular spills, David O'Connor of the United States conquered
the cross-country course with a perfect ride Thursday to retain the
lead in the Olympics individual three-day event.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connor, of The Plains, Va., added no penalties to his lead
after dressage on Custom Made, with 29.0. The other two U.S. riders
also got around the course clean.
</P>
<P>
   The medals will be decided by the show-jumping round on Friday.
With his lead of 7.6 points, O'Connor, a member of the bronze-medal
three-day team, can knock down one fence and still take the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''Custom Made was quite amazing,'' O'Connor said. ''It was a day
that worked perfect.''

<P>
   Not for everyone or every horse.
</P>
<P>
   Two riders in the early going were hospitalized -- Roberto Macedo
of Brazil with a broken pelvis and Nils Haagensen of Denmark with a
broken shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Bermuda Gold, ridden by Mary Jane Tumbridge of Bermuda, broke
his left front leg at the second fence and was placed in a splint
bandage for support at a local vet clinic.
</P>
<P>
   There were 39 riders to start the day, and 13 were eliminated or
retired on course, many due to falls.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Antikatzidis of Greece has 37.4 on Michaelmas to stand
second, and Mark Todd of New Zealand has 39.0 on Eyespy II.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Costello of Southern Pines, N.C., ended the day in sixth
on Chevalier with only his 42.4 points left from dressage. Julie
Black of Newnan, Ga., was in 12th with 53.6 on Hyde Park Corner.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. riders, who had a late draw, were not aware of all the
problems happening out on the course.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm glad I didn't know that,'' Costello said.

   PHOENIX (AP) -- Rookie Ryan Lauzon scored the only even-strength
goal of the game at 8:36 of the third period, giving the Phoenix
Coyotes a 2-2 preseason tie with the Dallas Stars on Wednesday
night.
</P>
<P>
   Lauzon, Phoenix's fifth-round draft pick last year, scored on a
backhander from the slot as the Coyotes came from two goals down in
the final period.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremy Roenick scored a power-play goal at 4:44 of the third as
the Coyotes turned up the pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas goalie Marty Turco made 17 of his 43 saves in the third
period and six more in overtime.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Matvichuk had a power-play goal for Dallas midway
through the first period, and Ryan Christie scored with a man
advantage with 4:03 left in the second.
</P>
<P>
   Sean Burke stopped 25 of Dallas' 27 shots.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars began the third period with a 5-on-3 advantage for
1:39, but couldn't score.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (2-1-1-1) got back in it on its fifth power play and
first of the third period when Joe Juneau sent the puck to Roenick
for a one-timer from the slot.
</P>
<P>
   The overtime was the first for Dallas, which split its first two
preseason contests, and the second for Phoenix. San Jose beat the
Coyotes 4-3 in overtime of their opener.

<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Enrique Meza won in his coaching debut for
Mexico as Jared Borgueti and Marco Antonio Ruiz each scored a goal
in a 2-0 exhibition victory over Ecuador on Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Meza, who guided Toluca to three straight championships in the
Mexican First Division, took over the reins of the national team
one week earlier following the resignation of Manuel Lapuente.
</P>
<P>
   The 20,507 fans at Qualcomm Stadium cheered loudly for Meza
during introductions.
</P>
<P>
   Victor Ruiz assisted on both goals, each coming on a corner kick
to set up a close-range header. The first came on Mexico's second
shot of the game in the 10th minute and the second came in the 60th
minute.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Campos had to make only two saves for Mexico, which
matched Ecuador with 11 shots each. Ecuador's Jose Francisco
Cevallos had two stops.
</P>
<P>
   Borgueti nearly scored again in the 35th minute, when he caught
up with a bouncing pass in the penalty box, but his shot sailed
wide right.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador's Marlon Ayovi drew a yellow card in the 36th minute for
tripping Daniel Osorno. Osorno again went down in the 55th minute
with a push from Geovanny Espinoza, who also received a caution.
</P>
<P>
   Meza's debut was made easier since Ecuador was without many top
players because of commitments to club teams. Among those missing
for Ecuador was two other players with Mexican ties, Agustin
Delgado and Alex Aguinaga, each with Necaxa.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico has one more tuneup against Peru on Wednesday in San
Jose, Calif., in preparation for the CONCACAF semifinals in Mexico
City on Oct. 8 against Trinidad &AMP; Tobago, which won its meeting in
qualifying play.

<HEADLINE> Angels 7, Royals 4, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Kevin Stocker had a two-run double in
the 10th inning as the Anaheim Angels beat the Kansas City Royals
7-4 Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Stocker's double off Jose Santiago (7-6) came with one out and
capped a three-run inning. Troy Glaus gave Anaheim a 5-4 lead when
he reached on an error by shortstop Luis Ordaz and beat Mike
Sweeney's throw to the plate on Adam Kennedy's grounder to first.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney's two-run single, his 200th hit of the season, tied the
game at 4 in the ninth against Troy Percival.
</P>
<P>
   Percival (5-5), who has blown 10 of his 40 save opportunities,
started the ninth with a 4-2 lead but loaded the bases with a
one-out single and a pair of walks.
</P>
<P>
   He got off to a quick 0-2 count on Sweeney, but Sweeney worked
the count full and then fouled off two pitches before punching the
game-tying single up the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Petkovsek pitched the 10th for his second save.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who walked in his first three plate appearances, also
hit an infield single in the eighth. Teammate Johnny Damon has 201
hits, giving the Royals their first 200-hit tandem in club history,
but is hitless in his last 12 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Garret Anderson's two-run double capped a four-run fifth inning
for the Angels.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Beltran, making his second career start in right field
for the Royals, opened the door for Anaheim's four-run fifth inning
with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Beltran, normally a center fielder, misjudged Orlando Palmeiro's
short fly ball and started back toward the wall. He slipped as he
ran forward and the ball fell in for an RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Mo Vaughn followed with an RBI single and Anderson added a
two-run double.
</P>
<P>
   The Royals took a 2-0 lead on RBI singles by Rey Sanchez in the
third inning and Carlos Febles in the fourth off Angels starter Al
Levine. Levine gave up six hits in 4 1-3 innings, with four walks
and two strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Palmeiro was 3-for-5 with two doubles for Anaheim, and Jorge
Fabregas went 3-for-4 for Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Anderson has 14 RBIs against Kansas City this season, a team
high. ... The announced attendance of 11,442 was a season low at
Kauffman Stadium. ... Anaheim's Glaus still needs one more
extra-base hit to tie Doug DeCinces' club record of 77, set in
1982. Glaus singled once, reached on an error and struck out three
times on Wednesday. ... Kansas City's Joe Randa went 0-for-5,
grounding into two double plays, and had an 11-game hitting streak
snapped.

<HEADLINE> Men's Olympic Basketball Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JIM O'CONNELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Carlton Myers didn't live up to his
nickname, yet he still was the key to Italy's 78-66 victory over
New Zealand in Olympic basketball.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 guard is known as the ''Michael Jordan of Italy''
and, while he certainly didn't come up with any Jordanesque moves,
he did come up big when his team needed him Thursday (Wednesday
night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   Myers, a native of England, hit a 3-pointer with 12:55 to play
that gave Italy (2-1) the lead for good at 48-47. His shot started
a 15-3 run that he capped with a 1-on-3 fast break where his layup
was goaltended.
</P>
<P>
   ''We could have been upset unexpectedly and he was the one who
had the courage to keep us together,'' Italy coach Bogdan Tanjevic
said. ''He was good on defense. His nickname comes from that he has
always been the best defender and the best attacker in all the
important matches.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers had 20 points, six rebounds and four assists.
</P>
<P>
   ''The nickname also comes from his expression of his personality
and also physically they are both attractive men,'' Tanjevic said.
''If he were five centimeters (about two inches) taller, he could
play in the NBA. He has the speed, the elevation.''
</P>
<P>
   Myers, 29, plays for Bologna Fortitudo in the Italian League and
he has averaged about 20 points during the past five seasons.
</P>
<P>
   He had 11 points on 2-for-9 shooting in a 93-61 loss to the
United States on Tuesday, and U.S. coach Rudy Tomjanovich praised
him before and after the game as one of best combination guards in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand led 36-32 at halftime and was still in front 45-43
with 14:16 left on three 3-pointers by Pero Cameron, a 6-7,
276-pound forward who looks more like an offensive lineman with his
barrel chest and huge calves. When his long-range exhibition was
over, New Zealand really struggled against an Italian team known
for its defense.
</P>
<P>
   ''For one brief period, Italy got right on top of us,'' New
Zealand coach Keith Mair said. ''They're so good and so
professional, they won't let you back in.''
</P>
<P>
   Giancomo Galanda and Alessandro Abbio each added 14 points for
Italy, while Cameron topped New Zealand with 18 points, all but
three from beyond the 3-point arc. Cameron also had six assists and
five rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Canada 91, Spain 77
</P>
<P>
   Michael Meeks was 8-for-8 from the field, including four
3-pointers, and scored 24 points as Canada (3-0) clinched a berth
in the quarterfinals.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's cool,'' Meeks, who played at Canisius, said when told
he didn't miss a shot. ''I can't ever remember having a perfect
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Canada has been perfect in its first Olympic appearance since
1988, when current coach Jay Triano was a starting guard.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've told them how disappointing that was,'' he said of the
sixth-place finish in Seoul. ''They haven't got caught up in the
Olympic experience, they are focusing on this tournament. They have
not gone to another event. They said they can go to another
Olympics to watch.''
</P>
<P>
   Pete Guarasci added 17 points for Canada, which shot 61.5
percent from the field (32 for 52), including 10 for 19 from
3-point range.
</P>
<P>
   John Rogers had 15 points for Spain (1-2).
</P>
<P>
France 82, China 70
</P>
<P>
   France's Antoine Rigaudeau and Laurent Forest stayed on the
perimeter to more than offset China's huge frontline by combining
for 51 points, including eight 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Rigaudeau had just two points at halftime on 1-for-7 shooting
but he found the range in the second half and his 3-pointer with
5:38 to play gave the France (2-1) the lead for good at 69-68 and
started a game-closing 16-2 run.
</P>
<P>
   Rigaudeau, who finished with 29 points on 11-for-19 shooting --
including 6-of-11 from 3-point range -- and Forest, who had 22
points, had all the points in the closing run as China (1-2)
committed six of its 21 turnovers in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Yao Ming, China's 7-5 center, finished with 14 points, while 7-1
Wang Zhizhi had nine points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   China appeared the have the game under control, leading 59-45
with 12 minutes to play. But France came up with most of its 12
steal the rest of the game, and Rigaudeau and Forest stayed hot
from the outside.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- In a day of injury and intrigue,
defending tennis gold medalist Lindsay Davenport left the Olympics
with a bad foot and track star Marie-Jose Perec departed Sydney
with some bad vibes.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, the Atlanta champion and top seed at the Sydney
Games, defaulted her second-round match Thursday to end her hopes
of a second consecutive medal. She had aggravated her sprained left
foot in a first-round victory over Paola Suarez.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's surprising decision was announced just before she
was to take the court against Rossana De Los Rios of Paraguay.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, French track star Perec -- dubbed the ''Greta Garbo of
athletics'' -- decided she wants to be alone.
</P>
<P>
   The reclusive 1996 gold medalist fled Australia for Singapore
after she was threatened by a man who burst into her Sydney hotel
room, according to her main sponsor. There were no further details
provided on the mysterious incident.
</P>
<P>
   Her sudden departure led to ''will she or won't she?''
speculation Thursday (Wednesday night EDT) over Perec's Olympic
future, but her return seemed a longshot.
</P>
<P>
   ''She hasn't been officially excluded from the team,'' said
Michel Vial, head of the French delegation. ''At this point, being
in Singapore, it is very improbable that she will compete.''
</P>
<P>
   Denise Kaigler, a spokeswoman for Reebok, said it was possible
that Perec could still compete in the Olympics. Earlier, she had
said Perec was definitely out.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone agreed on one thing: Perec, 32, had left Sydney on a
plane bound for Singapore just one day before her scheduled heat in
the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Perec, who suffers from a rare disease that causes chronic
fatigue, had surprised French Olympic officials by disappearing
from her hotel room. Since arriving in Sydney, she had dodged the
media and refused to train with the French team; the Australian
media quickly compared her to the ultra-private Garbo.
</P>
<P>
   Perec was the defending champion in the 200 and 400 meters,
making her only the second women ever to complete that double.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SOFTBALL: Tears of disappointment and disbelief were flowing
in the U.S. dugout after a third bitter loss in as many games for
the softball team. Lisa Fernandez surrendered a two-run homer as
Australia rallied in the bottom of the 13th inning to win 2-1 over
the numbed American, who had taken the lead in the top of the
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez lost despite striking out 25 and surrendering just two
hits. The defeat will, at minimum, cost the Americans (2-3) a bye
in the medal round.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BOXING: Everything fell into place Thursday to set up the most
anticipated fight of the Sydney Games. U.S. 201-pounder Michael
Bennett, with a victory in his Olympic debut, advanced to a
quarterfinal showdown with Cuban heavyweight great Felix Savon.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett, 29, who started fighting after his July 1998 release
from prison, scored an 11-2 decision over Wojciech Bartnik of
Poland. Savon, trying to join fellow Cuban Teofilo Stevenson and
Lazlo Papp of Hungary as three-time boxing gold medalists, defeated
Rasmus Ojemaye of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The first 10 American boxers in the ring have all won. Bennett
faces Savon next week.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BAILEY'S ILLNESS: Atlanta gold medalist Donovan Bailey may
join Davenport on the sidelines. A viral infection had greatly
slowed the one-time world's fastest man.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's congested, he's not feeling well,'' Bailey's agent, Ray
Flynn, said Thursday morning (Wednesday night EDT). ''He's not
feeling 100 percent by any means. He's got flu-like symptoms.''
</P>
<P>
   Competition in the 100 meters begins Friday, and Bailey was
hopeful that he could be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been in bed for two days,'' Bailey said.
''Psychologically, I'm very strong. But it's the physical thing I
have to deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- SWIMMING: The Americans continued to treat the Olympic pool
like a U.S. water park.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Bennett, the gold medalist in 1996, was top qualifier in
the preliminaries Thursday (Wednesday night EDT) in the 800-meter
freestyle. A victory in Friday's 800 final would put her with Janet
Evans (1988, 1992) as the only back-to-back winners in the grueling
event.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett has already won Sydney gold in the 400 freestyle.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Hall Jr. of Phoenix qualified second in the preliminaries
of the 50 freestyle, just 14 hours after winning bronze in the 100
free. The field in the race was loaded, with two-time defending
champion Alexander Popov of Russia, Pieter van den Hoogenband of
the Netherlands and American Anthony Ervin.
</P>
<P>
   The qualifiers came after longshot Misty Hyman and relay team
anchor Jenny Thompson won gold medals in record times for the
American swimmers one night earlier.
</P>
<P>
   For Thompson, the 800-meter freestyle relay victory catapulted
her into rarified Olympic company. Her seven golds are more than
any woman swimmer, snapping a tie with Germany's Kristin Otto.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson, 27, who also has a silver in her career, tied Czech
Republic gymnast Vera Caslavaska for the second-most Olympic golds
by a woman. With teammates Samantha Arsenault, Diana Munz and
Lindsay Benko, she established an Olympic record of 7 minutes,
57.80 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old Hyman shocked defending champion Susie O'Neill
of Australia to win the 200 butterfly. Hyman shocked herself, too;
upon seeing her Olympic-record time, she repeatedly said, ''Oh my
God! Oh my God!''
</P>
<P>
   Amid the red, white and blue celebration, the orange-clad fans
of the Netherlands had reason to cheer as a Dutchman nicknamed
''Hoogie'' turned some of the world's top swimmers into mere
blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   Pieter van den Hoogenband won gold in the 100 freestyle in 48.30
seconds, whipping two-time defending gold medalist Alexander Popov
of Russia. Popov settled for silver and American Gary Hall Jr. took
the bronze.
</P>
<P>
   Van den Hoogenband became the first man to sweep the 100 and 200
freestyles since American Mark Spitz in 1972.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- TENNIS: The last women to defeat Venus Williams could await
the streaking U.S. tennis player in the Olympic quarterfinals.
Williams, whose 28-match win streak included titles at Wimbledon
and the U.S. Open, defeated Tamarine Tanasugarn of Thailand 6-2,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario of Spain won as well, defeating Patricia
Wartusch of Austria 6-2, 6-4. If both players win their next match,
they meet in the Olympic quarterfinals; Williams last loss was to
Sanchez-Vicario at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- BEACH VOLLEYBALL: With her dad, Olympic decathlon champion
Rafer Johnson, sitting amid the sellout crowd, American Jenny
Johnson Jordan and teammate Annett Davis reached the quarterfinals
with a 15-9 victory over Cuba. The Americans trailed 9-6 before
ripping off the last nine points of the match.
</P>
<P>
   America's other team, Holly McPeak and Misty May, advanced with
a tense 15-13 victory over Italy.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   -- MEN'S VOLLEYBALL: With their third straight loss, the American
volleyball team was mired in last place and a longshot to take a
medal. Yugoslavia bashed the U.S. team (0-3) in straight sets,
25-15, 25-20, 25-23. While not mathematically eliminated, the
Americans will need help to reach the quarterfinals.

<HEADLINE> Davenport Withdraws From Olympics  </HEADLINE>
By STEVEN WINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Defending champion Lindsay Davenport
withdrew Thursday from the Olympics because of a foot injury,
ending a bid by the U.S. team for a medals sweep in women's tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Further tests were planned to determine whether the injury is a
stress fracture, and Davenport said she could be sidelined the rest
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Her withdrawal means there will be no rematch in the final
against second-seeded Venus Williams, who beat Davenport this year
to win Wimbledon and U.S. Open titles.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport, seeded No. 1, sprained the outside of her left foot
last month and aggravated the injury in a first-round win Wednesday
over Paola Suarez. Her withdrawal was announced just before she was
to take the court for a second-round match against Rossana De Los
Rios.
</P>
<P>
   ''To have to pull out of a tournament that's probably the
highlight of my career, it's devastating,'' Davenport said.
</P>
<P>
   She played through the injury at the U.S. Open and said she
wasn't concerned about it when she arrived in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was feeling OK until I started practicing on these courts,''
she said. ''They're stickier and harder on my foot than other
surfaces.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport said the foot was sore following her first-round match
and worse when she tried to practice Thursday morning (Wednesday
EDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''It was hard to put any weight on it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams won her 28th match in a row Thursday, beating Tamarine
Tanasugarn of Thailand 6-2, 6-3. Third-seeded Monica Seles beat
Miriam Oremans of the Netherlands 6-1, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. captain Billie Jean King had talked of Davenport being part
of a medals sweep.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's a very sad moment she can't defend her gold medal
properly,'' King said.
</P>
<P>
   Davenport is a second-generation Olympian, and her victory in
Atlanta four years ago marked a career turning point. She has since
won three Grand Slam titles and earned the No. 1 ranking.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since Atlanta ended I was looking forward to coming here,''
she said. ''I'm not angry. I'm just disappointed and sad.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams' victory left her one round from a quarterfinal
showdown against the last player to beat her, Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario. The fifth-seeded Spaniard advanced to the third
round by beating Patricia Wartusch of Austria 6-2, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Williams lost to Sanchez-Vicario at the French Open, then began
her winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''A few times she has gotten the best of me, but a few times
I've gotten the best of her,'' Williams said. ''So we'll see what
happens in that quarterfinal, given that we both get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Since her last loss, Williams has won Wimbledon and the U.S.
Open. Now she wants her first Olympic medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd love that,'' she said with a grin. ''Everyone watches at
home, and you see people standing on the podium crying and shaking.
That would be a nice feeling. It's pretty rare.''
</P>
<P>
   Against Tanasugarn, Williams won playing less than her best. She
rarely ventured to the net and had 10 double faults, including
three in one game.
</P>
<P>
   ''I guess I wasn't trying very hard,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Williams saved her only overhead for match point, slamming a
winner to close out the victory in 63 minutes.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Isler Drops Down in 470 Fleet  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- J.J. Isler thought the women's 470
Olympic sailing competition was going to be wide open, and she was
right.
</P>
<P>
   Isler watched her overall lead disappear Thursday (Wednesday
night EDT) as she dropped into third place after four races. She
finished 15th out of 19 boats in the third fleet race, then
rebounded to finish third in the next race.
</P>
<P>
   Isler had finished sixth and first in the opening two races
Wednesday to hold a slight lead. She now trails skippers from
Germany and New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   Isler and several other skippers flew protest flags at the end
of the first race on the Pacific Ocean. Protests are heard at night
back at the Rushcutters Bay marina.
</P>
<P>
   Isler, of San Diego, and crew member Pease Glaser of Long Beach,
Calif., fell significantly behind while sailing downwind on the
second leg of the third race and never recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Foerster of Garland, Texas, finished fourth and 11th in the
men's 470 to move from eighth to sixth place overall after four
races. His crew member is Bob Merrick of Portsmouth, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   On the 49er course, brothers Jonathan and Charlie McKee, who
came into the day second overall, had their first poor day of the
series, finishing 14th and 13th. They did rebound to win the third
race of the day.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers raced off the suburb of Manly, where the north wind
reached 12 knots at its highest, giving some kick to the winged
skiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The McKees' previous worst finish was sixth. They were the last
of the 17 crews to have a finish of 10th or worse.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan McKee, 40, won the gold medal in the Flying Dutchman in
1984 and Charlie McKee, 38, won the bronze in the 470 in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers will race 16 times while all other classes except
Soling race 11 times. The Soling fleet races concluded Wednesday,
with American skipper Jeff Madrigali finishing fourth to earn a
first-round bye in the match-racing series.
</P>
<P>
   Europe skipper Courtenay Becker Dey of The Dalles, Ore., the
1996 bronze medalist who was 21st after two races, finished fifth
in the third race. Race four went off late in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Women's windsurfer Lanee Butler of Aliso Viejo, Calif., remained
fourth overall with a seventh-place in the seventh fleet race, and
Mike Gebhardt of Fort Pierce, Fla., was ninth overall after
finishing 10th.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Tornado crew of John Lovell of New Orleans and Charlie
Ogletree of Newport Beach, Calif., was second in the fifth fleet
race and remained in sixth place.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Whitewater Saga Not Over  </HEADLINE>
By PETE YOST
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, won't
be charged in the Whitewater investigation, but the country hasn't
heard the last of the saga that has its origins in a failed
Arkansas land deal in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Whitewater first came to public attention in the 1992
presidential campaign amid questions about the failure of a savings
and loan owned by the Clintons' Whitewater business partners, Jim
and Susan McDougal. On Wednesday, Independent Counsel Robert Ray
announced that there was ''insufficient'' evidence to prove beyond
a reasonable doubt that either one of the Clintons committed a
crime in Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   Ray's finding would seem to be the last word. But it isn't.
</P>
<P>
   Here in question and answer form is a look at what's to become
of the most expensive criminal investigation in the two-decade
history of the independent counsel law, lasting throughout most of
Clinton's eight years as president.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If it's not over, what's next?
</P>
<P>
   A: A final report on the Clintons' conduct is being written by
prosecutors. Expected to run hundreds of pages, it will be filed
under seal with a federal appeals court, which will decide when to
release it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Will the report simply recite the facts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Perhaps, but if experience is any guide, it also could be
highly critical of the Clintons. Previous independent counsel
reports have stirred major controversy. One independent counsel's
final report suggested that a former U.S. attorney general, Edwin
Meese, probably broke the law, even though he never was charged. A
final report in the Iran-Contra arms and money affair suggested a
high-level criminal cover-up. Meese heatedly denied the
accusations, as did all the participants in the alleged Iran-Contra
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Q: If the report isn't even written yet, what's its
significance?
</P>
<P>
   A: It will be yet another battleground for the Clintons and
their political opponents in the years to come. If first lady
Hillary Rodham Clinton is elected to the Senate, the report could
become a troublesome issue in her political life if it reveals new
details or draws critical conclusions about her conduct in
Whitewater. For the president, it becomes a legacy issue. But
Clinton may have far more than legacy issues to deal with. In the
end, Ray will get the last word, not on Whitewater, but on whether
to seek criminal charges against Clinton in the Monica Lewinsky
scandal after Clinton leaves office next year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Even if Clinton isn't charged in the Lewinsky scandal, is
that the end of it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably not. Ray's office is likely to write a final report
describing the basis for any decision not to prosecute.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who gets the last word in any final report?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Clintons' lawyers do. They will be given the opportunity
to file written rebuttals that will accompany any public release of
a report by a federal appeals court that appoints independent
counsels.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Prosecutors have taken six years to investigate Whitewater.
What took them so long?
</P>
<P>
   A: Three reasons. First, new evidence kept surfacing, such as
Mrs. Clinton's long-sought law firm billing records which first
revealed her legal work on a fraud-riddled land development south
of Little Rock, Ark. Second, prosecutors ''turned'' a major figure
in the scandal, Jim McDougal, who had refused to cooperate until a
jury convicted him of 18 felonies. It was McDougal's cooperation
that led prosecutors to a new dimension in Whitewater -- a loan of
$27,000 inside McDougal's S&AMP;L in then-governor Clinton's name. The
president's lawyer has suggested Clinton knew nothing about the
loan. Three, the White House in a time-consuming move, challenged
the prosecutor's efforts to get notes of White House lawyers'
conversations with Mrs. Clinton. After a drawn-out court battle,
the prosecutors got the notes. Ray said the process ''complicated
... our access'' to evidence and prolonged the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why did Ray make his Whitewater statement now?
</P>
<P>
   A: The prosecutor said at the beginning of this year that he
wanted to have a prompt resolution of pending matters in the
investigation. Ray has stuck to a fairly rigorous schedule in
closing out various aspects of the investigation. While closing out
Whitewater without bringing charges against the Clintons, Ray's
action has not met with universal approval among Democrats. Sen.
Carl Levin, D-Mich., for example said Ray should have filed his
findings under seal with the judges who appointed him. Ray
''violated the fairness that the law intends,'' Levin said.

<HEADLINE> Ewing traded to Sonics in four-team deal  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   Patrick Ewing's 15-year career with the Knicks ended Wednesday
night when New York sent him to Seattle in a four-team, 12-player
trade also involving the Los Angeles Lakers and Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks sent Ewing to the SuperSonics and received Glen Rice
from the Lakers and Luc Longley from the Suns. Among the other
major players moving were Horace Grant from Seattle to Los Angeles
and Chris Dudley from New York to Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ''It became clear that he was looking for a change and when he
requested a trade, we respected his request,'' Knicks general
manager Scott Layden said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was important in doing so, however, that we had the ability
to add value, and we believe we have done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Various trades involving Ewing and Rice have been in the works
for the past month, including one involving Detroit that fell apart
at the last moment in mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks, Lakers and Sonics then discussed a three-team deal,
but the Knicks wouldn't pull the trigger because they felt they
weren't getting enough in return.
</P>
<P>
   Once the Suns entered the picture, the talks heated up again.
</P>
<P>
   Several other players were included in the trade to make it work
under league salary cap guidelines. The Knicks got Vernon Maxwell,
Vladimir Stepania and Lazaro Borrell from Seattle and Travis Knight
from Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   New York also got first-round draft picks in 2001 from the
Lakers and Sonics, and two second-round picks in 2001 from Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also get Greg Foster, Chuck Person and Emanuel Davis
from Seattle. Phoenix gets the Knicks' No. 1 pick in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   ''Getting Patrick accomplishes a big offseason goal of ours,''
said Sonics general manager Wally Walker, adding that 48 trade
scenarios were discussed between the Sonics, Knicks and Lakers.
''Until we got on the conference call with the league this
afternoon, I had no confidence that the deal would get done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice, a free agent, received a one-year offer from the Chicago
Bulls this week. But he wavered on signing it as his agent, David
Falk, tried to broker another deal, and the Bulls finally pulled
the offer off the table Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Rice ended up with the Knicks as part of a sign-and-trade
transaction in which he got a multiyear contract from the Lakers
before being shipped immediately to New York.
</P>
<P>
   The trade brings a close to Ewing's career in New York, where he
arrived as the No. 1 pick in the 1985 draft. He was expected to be
the type of franchise player who could bring the Knicks their first
championship since 1973, but it never happened.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Sonics have a center who can help them compete with the
better teams in the Western Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think Patrick's going to come and add us something that we
needed, We needed someone to cope with the Rasheed Wallaces and the
Shaquille O'Neals,'' Seattle's Gary Payton said. ''We hope this is
going to help Vin come back to the player he wants to be. I know
Patrick's going to help our scoring, and it should open up things
for me because a lot of people are going to be worried about
doubling Patrick.''
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's only appearance in the NBA Finals came in 1994 when the
Knicks lost to Houston in seven games. The Knicks made it back to
the finals in 1999, but Ewing was injured and did not play.
</P>
<P>
   ''Patrick is one the hardest working, most loyal players I have
ever been around,'' New York coach Jeff Van Gundy said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have told him more than once that he is a champion even if
he hasn't won a championship. He practiced and played like a
champion every day he was here. Seattle is fortunate to get a
player of his talent and character.''

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Targets Criticize Probe  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Arkansans are saying ''I told you so''
one more time after Independent Counsel Robert Ray decided
President Clinton and wife Hillary Rodham Clinton should not be
indicted in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a hollow victory for more than a dozen state residents
who were caught and convicted in the limelight of a national
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In wrapping up the most expensive independent counsel inquiry in
history, Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr, issued a statement
Wednesday saying there was ''insufficient'' or ''inconclusive''
evidence to warrant charges against the president and first lady in
the six-year, $52 million probe.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McDougal, a former Clinton business partner who spent 18
months in jail for refusing to cooperate with Starr, lashed out at
the investigation and criticized Ray for what she said was a
lukewarm absolution of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ''After they've gathered all of the evidence, all the documents
they said they couldn't find, all the testimony they said they
didn't have -- I answered every question at my trial -- they still
cannot come back as men and say there is no guilt there,'' McDougal
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said of Starr, ''I believe him to be a man of no
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal and her ex-husband, the now-deceased Jim McDougal, were
the Clintons' partners in the failed 1978 Whitewater land deal that
lent Starr's wide-ranging investigation its name. The McDougals and
then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were convicted of bank fraud May 28, 1996,
in the first Whitewater trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen other Arkansans were charged in the probe, largely with
white-collar crimes unrelated to the Clintons' business dealings
that were the original focus of the probe. Most pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor or felony charges ranging from misapplication of a
federal loan to defrauding the federal Small Business
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee said investigations conducted under the
Whitewater banner exposed criminal activity and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the process left scars on not just the guilty but many
innocent people as well,'' Huckabee said. ''Everyone feels relieved
this chapter of our state's history has concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Herby Branscum Jr. and Robert Hill, owners of the Perry
County Bank in Perryville, were accused of illegally funneling
money from their bank to Clinton's campaigns for governor and
president.
</P>
<P>
   They were acquitted on the most serious charges, and the jury
deadlocked on the several others. Starr eventually dropped the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should never have been started,'' Branscum said, accusing
Starr of using heavy-handed tactics to bully innocent Arkansans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think these people who worked for Kenneth Starr know
what fairness is about. I wasn't treated fairly and I don't think
anyone else who had to deal with those people were treated
fairly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McDougal was sentenced to two years in prison but did not
begin serving the time for 18 months -- first she had to serve time
for contempt for refusing to answer questions about Clinton before
the Whitewater grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   She completed her contempt term March 9, 1998, and began her
Whitewater prison term. The following June, a judge reduced her
prison term to time served because she had health problems. She
still faced a criminal contempt indictment for again refusing to
talk to a grand jury about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She was acquitted of an unrelated California embezzlement charge
in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, a federal jury deadlocked on the two criminal
contempt charges and acquitted McDougal on an obstruction of
justice charge. The judge declared a mistrial on the contempt
charges. Starr's office opted not to retry the case. Her former
husband died in a federal prison in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal now cares for her ailing parents in Camden while not
traveling the country lecturing about women in prison.

<HEADLINE> IMF Meeting Angers Czech Merchants  </HEADLINE>
By ANDREA LORINCZOVA
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) -- Economic leaders are gathering to
boost global business and share the wealth more fairly, but don't
tell that to merchants in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Tight security and fears of violent protests have prompted many
to close their doors -- or even get out of town -- as the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and G-7 finance
ministers come to town over the next week.
</P>
<P>
   ''No business goes on here,'' grumbled Ladislav Malovec, owner
of two shops that will close for 10 days beginning Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Malovec angrily shook his head when asked how much money he
expects to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't want to talk about it,'' Malovec said, standing behind
the counter in his empty grocery.
</P>
<P>
   Outside on the street, there were few ordinary citizens seen
among the armed police who were too busy patrolling the area to buy
anything.
</P>
<P>
   Stores along 15 streets around Prague's Congress Center, where
the world economic leaders will meet, were either closed Wednesday
or preparing to close.
</P>
<P>
   Global prosperity may be the goal, but Prague's fourth district
is being turned into a heavily guarded, temporary ghost town.
</P>
<P>
   Signs posted on doors and windows said: ''Due to the so-far
unpredictable situation during the IMF meeting the store will be
closed.''
</P>
<P>
   They were referring to the possibility of mass protests that
could turn the annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank into
embarrassing repeats of the violence that broke out during last
year's disastrous meeting of the World Trade Organization in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   A disparate group -- including human rights activists,
environmentalists, anarchists, communists and far right-wing
skinheads -- has announced plans for protests during the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Many shop owners are clearly concerned their stores could be
attacked by demonstrators who call economic globalization a huge
threat to ordinary people everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ''We sell paint, cleaning products and other things that are
flammable, so it will be safer to be closed,'' said Martina
Zarubova, a shop assistant in a household goods store that will
shut for a week.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to salvage whatever business can be saved, employees
posted a sign out front urging customers to ''Shop in time!''
</P>
<P>
   But many, if not most, had already vacated the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Those citizens who chose to stay face more problems from tight
security.
</P>
<P>
   Police have put the neighborhood under heavy guard, forcing
residents to show identifications as they come and go. Friends and
relatives must be accompanied by someone who can prove residency.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who has a car can't park here. Residents have had to
move their vehicles elsewhere for security reasons, said Helena
Glesgova, a spokeswoman for the fourth district. But officials have
opened the way for silver Audis, Skodas or minivans that will
transport IMF and World Bank delegates in and out.
</P>
<P>
   Glesgova said shop owners would be free to supply their stores
during the night.
</P>
<P>
   That brought little comfort.
</P>
<P>
   On the window of the Jas meat shop, workers used pink paint to
write on the glass: ''due to the IMF meeting we were not allowed to
supply the store.''

<HEADLINE> Gore Seeking Edge With Energy Issue  </HEADLINE>
By H. JOSEF HEBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Faced with growing concern over soaring prices
for heating oil this winter, Al Gore is trying to turn the energy
issue to political advantage, accusing oil companies of unnecessary
''profiteering'' and promising government action if prices continue
to rise.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning Thursday on Maryland's Eastern Shore, the Democratic
presidential candidate was outlining a plan for ''energy
independence'' and taking another swipe at oil company profits that
have more than doubled in the first half of the year compared with
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   To address the concerns, Gore was expected to call on Congress
to approve $400 million in additional federal assistance to help
poor people pay to heat their homes this winter. The Energy
Department predicts heating costs will be a third higher this year
than last.
</P>
<P>
   He also was prepared to make clear that the Clinton
administration was ready to make oil available from the Strategic
Petroleum Reserve if OPEC failed to increase production.
Administration sources said late Wednesday that a decision on
whether to tap the reserve was imminent.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shortly, I suspect the president will make some decision,''
Energy Secretary Bill Richardson told Northeast members of
Congress, adding that ''all options remain on the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore told reporters Wednesday that the OPEC ''have to keep their
promise to raise production and reduce the world oil price.''
</P>
<P>
   If they do not ''we can act. We should act,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries twice this
year has boosted oil production, but the actions have failed to
stem rising prices that hit a decade-high of $37.80 a barrel on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's Republican presidential rival, George W. Bush, said the
Clinton administration -- including Gore -- should ''be held
accountable for a failed energy policy'' that has thwarted domestic
oil production and failed to confront OPEC.
</P>
<P>
   Asked at a town meeting Wednesday in Pennsylvania what he would
do under the circumstances, Bush said he would ''use our diplomatic
leverage'' against OPEC and increase domestic drilling, including
in a protected arctic wildlife refuge in Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The refuge is believed to harbor about 10 billion barrels of
recoverable oil, but environmentalists strongly oppose its
development. Even if drilling were approved today, it would take a
decade or more before oil actually would flow from the refuge,
according to industry analysts.
</P>
<P>
   As he did last summer when gasoline prices soared to $2 a
gallon, Gore on Wednesday singled out oil company profits.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to look carefully at profiteering that has caused big
oil company profits to go up two to three times just as Americans
are paying skyrocketing price increases at the gas pump,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 major oil companies during the first eight months of this
year earned a total of $15.5 billion, nearly triple the profits
during the same period in 1999 when oil prices were depressed,
according to the Energy Information Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Profits totaled $10.3 billion in the second quarter alone.
</P>
<P>
   Independent oil producers also fared well, with earnings up 259
percent in the second quarter, compared with the same period a year
earlier, according to the EIA.
</P>
<P>
   Continuing the populist theme of recent weeks, Gore portrayed
himself as the man ''who is going to fight for people even when it
means standing up to big oil companies and foreign oil.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I have never hesitated to do that,'' Gore insisted, alluding
to Bush's past as a former oilman and his running mate, Dick
Cheney, a former executive of a major oil supply company.
</P>
<P>
   Northeast lawmakers for some time have urged the administration
to draw from the government's emergency reserve, which holds nearly
600 million barrels of crude.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was said to favor using the reserve as leverage to try to
persuade OPEC to increase production. One option under review
within the administration is an oil ''swap'' that would inject
additional supplies into the market without actually selling
government oil.
</P>
<P>
   The government would put oil out for bid. Companies would be
lent a certain amount of oil from the reserve and would replace it
at a future date when oil prices, presumably, would be lower. No
money would be exchanged, but more oil would be put into the
market.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department already is trading oil from the reserve in
exchange for heating oil. It hopes to stockpile 2 million barrels
of heating oil in a new Northeast storage facility by the end of
October for use in case of a supply disruption this winter. About
500,000 barrels of heating oil already is in place.

<HEADLINE> Australia 2, U.S. 1, in Softball  </HEADLINE>
By JIMMY GOLEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BLACKTOWN, Australia (AP) -- The U.S. softball team can no longer
afford to worry about revenge.
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Fernandez gave up a two-run homer Thursday as Australia
rallied in the bottom of the 13th inning to win 2-1, leaving the
United States reeling after a third straight loss.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez struck out 25 and gave up just two hits. But the
Americans were unable to score until Christie Ambrosi's RBI single
in the top of the 13th, scoring the tie-break runner who is placed
at second base to start every inning after the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez retired the first two batters in the bottom half of
the inning before Peta Edebone hit it over the left-field wall for
two runs to send the Australian crowd into a frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   While the Aussies dropped to the ground in exhaustion around
home plate, the Americans retreated to the dugout, crying.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans should still make the medal round, but they would
have to win five consecutive games to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I've ever been a part of a bigger challenge than
we're in right now,'' said Fernandez, who had allowed just one hit,
one walk and one single before the homer.
</P>
<P>
   It was the third consecutive U.S. game that was scoreless into
extra innings, and the third that ended with the defending Olympic
champions looking dazed.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like this voodoo that's over us,'' Ambrosi said. ''But
it's got to end sometime.''
</P>
<P>
   The three-game losing streak is a stunning turnaround for a team
that had won 112 in a row heading to Sydney and has never lost
three straight international games.
</P>
<P>
   The last U.S. loss, before this week, had been to Australia at
the 1998 world championships. The Americans' only loss at the '96
Olympics came when Australia's Joanne Brown homered off Fernandez
with two outs in the 10th to spoil her perfect game.
</P>
<P>
   Fernandez retired Brown on a groundout for the second out of the
13th on Thursday before Edebone homered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was sitting in the locker room, thinking, 'It can't happen
again.' But one thing about Atlanta is, we won the gold,''
Fernandez said. ''Take these games and give me the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   The history was enough to make Thursday's matchup the focus for
both teams. But the game became increasingly important when both
teams lost to Japan -- and then the Americans lost to China, which
has yet to play Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The top four in the eight-team tournament advance after the
round-robin. But the medal round is set up so that the third and
fourth place teams would have to win an extra game to win the gold
medal.
</P>
<P>
   Having lost to the top three teams in the standings, the
Americans -- heavy favorites coming in -- are likely headed for
fourth. They will have to beat non-contenders New Zealand and Italy
in the round robin and then win three straight in the medal round
to win the gold.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, a fire alarm went off and Olympic officials
asked everyone to vacate the stadium. But the stadium crew
continued its cleanup work as firefighters walked through the
stands.

<HEADLINE> Peruvians Divided on President  </HEADLINE>
By BILL CORMIER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Peruvians remain deeply divided over the rule
of President Alberto Fujimori and fearful about the uncertain
position of the country's politically powerful military, filling
the capital's streets with rallies both for and against him.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of anti-Fujimori demonstrators lit tire fires and
protested outside his home Wednesday night, burning an effigy of
the president's unpopular spy chief, a shadowy figure at the center
of a bribery scandal that is forcing Fujimori to end 10 years in
power.
</P>
<P>
   Chanting slogans, about 500 students and labor activists called
for Vladimiro Montesinos to be prosecuted. They also demanded
Fujimori step down immediately. As the scandal surfaced last week,
the president stunned Peruvians by announcing he would call new
elections and cut short his own term.
</P>
<P>
   Only the night before, Fujimori had greeted thousands of
sympathizers outside the Government Palace, scaling the towering
gates to show himself still firmly in charge. Mocking the
president, one demonstrator Wednesday night dressed in mime's white
facepaint, donned jail stripes and hung off the gate, waving to the
crowd with a sign on his neck reading ''No to Corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Scores of riot police guarded the palace but did not intervene
as students lit tire fires outside the downtown Lima building and
kicked some toward lines of officers, sparks flying.
</P>
<P>
   One major lingering political question in a country with a long
history of military coups was the position of the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori assured Peruvians that military commanders remain loyal
to him and that there was no danger of rebellion over his decision
to fire Montesinos. But the military remained ominously silent
Wednesday -- in sharp contrast to the swift, rock-solid support they
have expressed for him in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful military has played a leading role during
Fujimori's decade-long rule, shoring up his government in times of
protest against his often-tough measures. Peru's military last
ruled from 1968 to 1980.
</P>
<P>
   But Montesinos has hand-picked all six of Peru's regional
commanders and former presidential candidate Alejandro Toledo said
there was a tug of war between the two men over control of the
army.
</P>
<P>
   ''President Fujimori apparently does not have the power to fire
Montesinos,'' said Toledo, who withdrew from May's presidential
runoff after accusing Fujimori of planning to rig the results.
</P>
<P>
   Peru's ombudsman, Jorge Santistevan, urged the armed forces to
make a public declaration of support for Fujimori. Opposition
leaders also expressed concern about the silence.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats who are following the situation closely said they
believe the government has the military under control and there is
no danger or a coup.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos is out as we understand it. He is not exercising
his functions. He's fired,'' said a high-ranking Western diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   Military analysts and retired army generals questioned that
view.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos is using all his fire power to avoid being
dismissed. The question is whether he is willing to carry this game
to an armed confrontation against the government, including other
sectors of the military,'' said political analyst Mirko Lauer.
</P>
<P>
   Even people in the street had doubts about Fujimori's ability to
oust Montesinos.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in a dangerous moment. The generals could still try a
coup. Their hands are as dirty as Montesinos' hands,'' said Gabriel
Cochan, a 38-year-old unemployed electrician.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Fujimori's approval rating soared after his
announcement Saturday that he would not run for office in the new
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The independent polling firm CPI said 62.5 percent of Peruvians
agreed with that decision. At the same time, CPI said Fujimori's
approval rating had soared to 59.1 percent, his highest rating this
year. The poll of 400 Peruvians had a margin of error of five
percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Inflation last year was 3.7 percent and guerrilla insurgencies
have been largely dismantled by Fujimori, winning him considerably
support, particularly in the countryside.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents continued to pressure Fujimori to show he was in
control by dealing decisively with Montesinos, his former top
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo demanded that Montesinos face justice after last week's
release of a videotape that showed the national intelligence chief
allegedly bribing an opposition lawmaker to join Fujimori's ranks.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape's airing unleashed the political crisis, and
Montesinos has not been seen in public for days.

Clintons Not Charged in Whitewater Probe
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, won't be charged
in the Whitewater investigation, but the country hasn't heard the last of the
saga that has its origins in a failed Arkansas land deal in the 1980s.
Whitewater first came to public attention in the 1992 presidential campaign amid
questions about the failure of a savings and loan owned by the Clintons'
Whitewater business partners, Jim and Susan McDougal. On Wednesday, Independent
Counsel Robert Ray announced that there was ''insufficient'' evidence to prove
beyond a reasonable doubt that either one of the Clintons committed a crime in
Whitewater.

<HEADLINE> Eastwood Defends His Hotel in Suit  </HEADLINE>
By BRIAN BERGSTEIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- A woman accusing Clint Eastwood of
violating the Americans with Disabilities Act at a historic hotel
he owns testified that she sent him two letters about the problem
but got no response.
</P>
<P>
   Diane zum Brunnen, 51, who suffers from muscular dystrophy and
uses a wheelchair, is seeking unspecified damages in a federal
lawsuit against Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   The actor-director acknowledges his Mission Ranch in Carmel was
not fully accessible to wheelchairs, but says he was not given a
fair chance to improve it before he was sued.
</P>
<P>
   Zum Brunnen began testifying Wednesday while about 15 people in
wheelchairs watched in the courtroom and protested outside. Her
testimony was scheduled to continue Thursday, possibly followed by
Eastwood.
</P>
<P>
   With Eastwood watching from the defense table, zum Brunnen and
her husband both testified they had dinner at Mission Ranch in 1995
and considered staying there. They said they later wrote Eastwood
to complain that there were no ramps at key places and that the
wheelchair-accessible guest room was $225 a night, when other rooms
were as low as $85.
</P>
<P>
   That letter went unanswered, the zum Brunnens said, so she sent
a second to Eastwood via certified mail. The letter was refused.
</P>
<P>
   The zum Brunnens say they again had dinner at Mission Ranch on
Jan. 21, 1996, and discovered that the accessible bathroom for the
restaurant was more than 200 feet away, through the parking lot;
and the main office could be reached only by climbing two stairs.
They sued a year later.
</P>
<P>
   Eastwood attorney Chuck Keller challenged inconsistencies in the
couple's stories that he said made it impossible to prove whether
they even visited Mission Ranch that day.
</P>
<P>
   John Burris, zum Brunnen's attorney, said Eastwood has spent
$6.7 million on renovations since buying it in 1986 but neglected
to improve wheelchair access, which would have cost less than
$20,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rules were violated at a time when it was easy to follow
the rules,'' Burris said.
</P>
<P>
   When asked Tuesday why he didn't settle the case, Eastwood, 70,
said, ''In my opinion, you settle when you're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   In May Eastwood testified before Congress in support of a bill
requiring that property owners be notified of alleged Americans
with Disabilities Act violations before they are sued.

<HEADLINE> IG Report Finds Security Breaches  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Justice Department officials assigned to train
foreign police were responsible for ''pervasive, recurrent and
persistent'' security violations in the mid-1990s, a report by the
department's inspector general concludes.
</P>
<P>
   The report says Justice Department employees also repeatedly
mishandled sensitive information in ways similar to the alleged
security violations by former CIA director John Deutch and former
Los Alamos scientist Wen Ho Lee, The Washington Post said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general's 414-page report is expected to be the
focus of a House Judiciary Committee hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The violations allegedly were committed by officials in the
Justice Department's Criminal Division, responsible for a program,
called the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance
Program, or ICITAP, that trains police in emerging democracies,
including former Soviet republics. The employees handle classified
information about the internal workings of foreign police.
</P>
<P>
   In one example given by the report, the former chief
administrative officer of the Criminal Division, who oversaw the
program, had improper relationships with two women in Russia. That,
combined with his top-secret security clearance, made him
''vulnerable to blackmail or extortion,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Robert K. Bratt, former chief administrative
officer of the Criminal Division, called the investigation
''scurrilous and unethical.'' Other officials accused of violations
are Janice Stromsen, ICITAP's former director, former associate
director Joseph Trincellito, and Cary Hoover, Stromsen's special
assistant. All have left ICITAP but remain with the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The Post reported that senior Justice officials plan to set up a
special independent process to determine penalties for the
offenders. Ordinarily, the inspector general's recommendations for
punishment would be reviewed by lawyers in the Criminal Division.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Worker Compensation Urged  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nuclear plant workers have a message for
lawmakers considering help for people exposed to health-robbing
levels of radiation: Hurry up, and don't be stingy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of us do not have time left on this Earth. We need your
action now,'' Ann Orick of Knoxville, Tenn., said in remarks
prepared for delivery at a House hearing Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   While she and other sick workers waited for a turn to tell their
stories to a House subcommittee, negotiations were continuing over
whether to create a government compensation program, and how much
compensation ought to be guaranteed for the workers who were
employed at federally run facilities.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department recently reversed 50 years of federal
policy by declaring that workers injured or killed by weapons-plant
exposure be compensated. The agency had proposed minimum lump sum
payments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate earlier this year approved a minimum of $200,000,
plus medical care, for workers suffering from beryllium disease,
silicosis or radiation-caused cancer.
</P>
<P>
   A revised estimate from the Congressional Budget Office said
such a program could cost about $1 billion over five years.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ted Strickland, D-Ohio, said House and Senate negotiators
were discussing a program that would provide no more than $100,000
per ailing worker, plus medical care.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is certainly not ideal,'' he said, adding that one thing
under consideration is that workers would not be allowed to recover
lost wages.
</P>
<P>
   A Senate-passed provision had left the maximum benefit
open-ended to enable workers to recover wages lost because their
exposure made them too sick to remain on the job, even though they
might be years or even decades from retirement age.
</P>
<P>
   The House never voted on a compensation program, so the
conference committee was considering whether to approve one as part
of a larger defense authorization bill.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Michaels, the Energy Department's top health official,
said he thought Thursday's hearing could persuade conferees to
enact a compensation program quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We spend $6 billion a year cleaning up the dirt around the
nuclear weapons complex. We should be willing to spend a portion of
that to take care of the workers we made sick,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In his prepared testimony, Sam Ray of Lucasville, Ohio, a
40-year uranium enrichment plant employee, described working
without protective clothing or radiation monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   Enriching uranium for nuclear weapons was done in strict
secrecy, and ''workers were kept in the dark about the hazards they
faced,'' said Ray, who suffers from a rare bone cancer and had his
larynx removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even to this day, we don't know what we confronted,'' he said.
''I hope your committee will see to it that we are not left out in
the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ''You must take the focus off the money and place it on the
people,'' agreed Orick, who worked at the government's weapons
plant in Oak Ridge, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   The sick workers said federal compensation is deserved because
work on the federal government's bombs caused their diseases, and
because state worker compensation programs haven't taken care of
them.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, the diseases had a long latency period and by the
time the workers were diagnosed, too many years had elapsed since
exposure and they didn't meet the state qualifications.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, government contractors actively fought the
workers' benefit claims, or record-keeping was lax, or secrecy

<HEADLINE> Reverse for Pentagon in Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heading off a rare public dispute with the
CIA, the Pentagon changed its explanation of why it took nearly two
years to appraise damage from security lapses by former CIA
Director John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Until reversing its position Wednesday, the Pentagon had
explained it wasn't able to assess the damage until February
because it lacked access to the unsecured computer files where
Deutch entered defense and intelligence secrets. The Pentagon
position changed after the CIA said publicly earlier in the day
that it offered access to those files in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon blamed the rejection of the offer on its own
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It indeed appears an offer was made by CIA investigators to a
DOD investigator in June of 1998 to examine information ... that
the CIA had gathered in its investigation of Dr. Deutch,'' a
Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said. ''That offer was
declined by DOD investigators without ever informing senior
leadership within DOD of the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said in an interview that the Pentagon investigators
declined the offer in 1998 because ''in their professional
judgment, no productive purpose would be served by starting a
separate effort'' parallel to the CIA's own probe of the Deutch
matter. ''Our investigators had confidence in their counterparts
over at CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said Wednesday, ''Our records show
that the CIA did offer them access on June 17, 1998, to the
journals that Deutch was working on. The journals were the parts
that would have been of interest to DOD. We did offer them access
to that at the time. They didn't pick up on it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlow added that the Pentagon had another chance to act in
August 1999 when it received a briefing on the spy agency's
findings about Deutch's handling of classified information. Defense
officials ''didn't request the underlying documents until February
2000,'' Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Monday that internal Defense
Department memos showed that in summer 1998 the CIA urged the
Pentagon to conduct a damage assessment. Those memos, however, did
not mention the CIA's offer to provide the Pentagon with the
computer files relevant to the military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Quigley said, ''This was all about a potential
compromise of classified information on computers that we did not
have in our possession.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear to me how we would have proceeded without
reinventing a lot of the effort that CIA investigators were doing
at the very same time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the Pentagon began its probe in February, only
after the CIA provided the materials from its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was a former top Pentagon official before moving to the
CIA, where he was director from May 1995 to December 1996. Now a
professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Deutch has
apologized for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said he could not estimate when the Pentagon's
investigation would be completed.

<HEADLINE> GAO Questions Contract Awards  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators say a federal
agency that guarantees pensions when employers go bankrupt awarded
$40 million in contracts to a friend of one of its executives.
</P>
<P>
   But Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s executive director says the
agency has investigated and cannot substantiate the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators say Bennie Hagans, the agency's insurance
operations director, had a close relationship with Integrated
Management Resources Group, a company owned by one of his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hagans' actions ... demonstrated a lack of impartiality
with respect to IMRG and created the appearance of improperly
influencing the award of the two contracts we investigated,'' the
General Accounting Office report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report said the matter would be referred to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   The report was to be released Thursday at a joint hearing of the
Senate Special Committee on Aging and the Senate Small Business
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   PBGC Executive Director David Strauss says the allegations have
been investigated for the past three years. ''No one has been able
to substantiate any allegations of misconduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., created in 1974, protects the
retirements of 42 million workers against the bankruptcy of their
employers. Strauss was expected to testify at Thursday's hearing,
which was expected to examine the agency's service to pensioners,
including contracting mismanagement and lack of computer security.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said between April 1997 when IMRG chief Myrna
Cooks started her company and October 1997, Hagans made 34 calls to
her home, where IMRG was based. Cooks told GAO officials those
calls concerned personnel problems at her old company but could not
provide examples.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hagans was similarly unable to explain the contents of the
many telephone conversations that he had had with Ms. Cooks,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said a Maryland bank officer with whom IMRG
tried to get a loan contacted Hagans. In his notes from the
discussion, the bank officer said ''Mr. Hagans had said he 'was a
very big fan of Myrna's (Ms. Cooks) and politicked within the
agency for her company to receive the bid,''' the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagans told the GAO he did not remember speaking to the bank
officer but if he had, it ''may look wrong'' and in hindsight it
would have been ''bad judgment.''

<HEADLINE> Senate Rejects Spending Measure  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Senate's lopsided rejection of a routine
spending bill that contains a pay raise for members of Congress is
hindering Republican efforts to resolve their budget battle with
President Clinton and hit the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   By 69-28, the Senate voted down the near-$33 billion measure
Wednesday, which would finance the Treasury Department, several
small agencies and Congress itself. It would also repeal the 3
percent federal tax on telephone service. Democrats said Clinton
would have vetoed the bill because it shortchanged the Internal
Revenue Service and counterterrorism programs.
</P>
<P>
   The measure will eventually be revived, perhaps as part of a
larger spending package. But for now, the vote underlined the
complicated task GOP leaders face as they race to finish the 11
remaining domestic and foreign aid spending bills for fiscal 2001,
which begins Oct. 1. Only two spending measures, both financing
military programs, have become law.
</P>
<P>
   With this November's elections for control of the White House
and Congress looming, Republican leaders would like to complete the
work by mid-October. They know that task will mean acceding to
demands by Clinton -- and lawmakers of both parties -- for billions
in added spending.
</P>
<P>
   In another illustration of the difficulties ahead, lawmakers
meeting in a basement room of the Capitol narrowed some differences
over an $18 billion measure financing the Interior Department and
cultural programs, but still found themselves with big gaps.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to provide $105 million for the National Endowment
for the Arts, the controversial agency's first budget increase
since 1995, when Republicans took control of Congress. And
Republicans ended efforts to block proposed administration rules
ending snowmobiling in many national parks.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure would provide just $420 million of the $970
million Clinton wants to buy new federal, state and local park
lands. And there were disputes over other environmental provisions,
such as one exempting New Hampshire's White Mountains from policies
aimed at limiting logging.
</P>
<P>
   All 43 voting Democrats plus 26 Republicans voted against the
Treasury measure.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained about GOP leaders' decision to speed
consideration of the bill by voting on a version approved earlier
by the House, without allowing amendments. Republicans said
Democrats were just looking for an excuse to slow Congress' work,
thereby embarrassing the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats wanted to slow the process down,'' Sen. Slade
Gorton, R-Wash., said of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Further adding to legislators' discomfort, the bill would clear
the way for members of Congress to receive a $3,800 pay raise in
January, a 2.7 percent increase that would put their salaries at
$145,100.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell, R-Colo., an author of the overall
bill, said many members facing re-election were ''scared to death''
to vote for the pay raise.
</P>
<P>
   ''That little nothing increase made them go limp in the spine,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Underlining that issue's political sensitivity, of the 29
senators running for re-election, 21 voted against the bill and
three did not vote. Many lawmakers who initially voted for the
measure changed their votes to ''no'' after it became apparent that
the bill would be defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Senate approval would have sent the measure to the White House.
The House approved it last Thursday by a narrow 212-209 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was actually a combination of two spending bills,
combined by GOP leaders in hopes of streamlining the budget
process. One contained $30.4 billion for the Treasury Department
and smaller agencies, the other $2.5 billion for Congress' own
operations.
</P>
<P>
   The bill provided $8.6 billion for the IRS, about $300 million
less than Clinton wants.

<HEADLINE> Bill Proposed Revising Credit Info  </HEADLINE>
By MARCY GORDON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Imagine you took a standardized test, an
important one that would determine whether you could get a new
credit card, a car loan or a home mortgage and what interest rate
you'd pay: and then your score was kept secret from you.
</P>
<P>
   You were told only whether you passed or failed and given a few
reasons for your failure in that event.
</P>
<P>
   Unlikely as it may seem, some people say that is what happens
with the three-digit credit scores assigned to consumers and used
to make lending decisions. They are not generally disclosed to
consumers, and some lawmakers are pushing to change that.
</P>
<P>
   Legislation is being proposed that would require credit bureaus
to disclose to consumers all the information in their files,
including their credit scores. In California, the first-ever state
bill to do so has cleared the Legislature and is awaiting Gov. Gray
Davis's signature.
</P>
<P>
   The somewhat mysterious credit scores, generated by computer
programs, are calculated by the major credit bureaus -- Equifax,
Experian and TransUnion -- and provided to banks and other lenders
as a snapshot of a consumer's credit risk at a given point in time.
In recent years, they have mostly replaced narrative credit reports
for making lending decisions. The credit reports themselves are
provided to consumers on request.
</P>
<P>
   The three-digit scores constitute a credit rating for each
consumer.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of credit scoring and a legislative proposal by
Rep. Chris Cannon, R-Utah, were being examined at a hearing
Thursday by the House Banking subcommittee on financial
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Cannon's measure would require disclosure of all credit
information, including scores, but stops short of mandating that it
be free of charge.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill allows the consumer to have the same information
that his or her financial institution receives,'' Cannon said
recently. ''This common-sense legislation solves a problem which
frustrates many consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Armed with their credit scores, consumers would be able to
comparison-shop for the best rates on loans, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Similar measures have been proposed by Sen. Charles Schumer,
D-N.Y., and Rep. Harold E. Ford, Jr., D-Tenn., who had a nasty
experience with a mistake on his credit record in 1996 that he says
still hasn't been rectified. His bill would entitle consumers to
one free credit report, including the score, from each credit
bureau every year.
</P>
<P>
   ''It sort of raised a red flag with me,'' the 30-year-old Ford,
who was first elected to Congress that year, said in an interview.
He noted that a number of other young, black professionals he knew
also found ''their reports were riddled with errors and it affected
their ability to get favorable terms.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation has support from consumer groups, Realtors and
lawmakers, yet prospects for passage this congressional session are
uncertain with only a few weeks remaining before lawmakers adjourn
for the year.
</P>
<P>
   There are several different models used for determining credit
scores, and lenders choose the ones they prefer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most common, known as the FICO model for the company
that developed it, Fair, Isaac and Co. Inc., rates consumers as
credit risks on a scale from around 300 to 900. A range of about
620 to 640 often is considered a ''passing'' grade; below that
level, consumers can be denied credit or offered ''subprime'' loans
at higher interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   The criteria for rating consumers include past payment history
of all types of accounts, incidences of delinquent payments, amount
of money owed to creditors in relation to income, and length of
time credit has been established.
</P>
<P>
   Late payments can lower a consumer's score, while a good record
of paying on time can raise it. Companies that devise the scores
say they don't take into account a consumer's gender, ethnic group,
marital status, religion or nationality.

<HEADLINE> Navy Seeks Relatives of WWII Pilots  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jack Parlier was itching to fly.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of March 25, 1944, from Alaska's Attu Island at the
westernmost tip of the Aleutian chain, the 22-year-old Navy weather
specialist finally got his chance.
</P>
<P>
   ''He took off, and he never came back,'' recalls Paul Carrigan,
a retired Navy weatherman who briefed Parlier that day on what to
expect aboard a Ventura PV-1 patrol bomber whose mission was to fly
east through the darkness to Japan's northern Kuril Islands, bomb
the target and return to Casco Field on Attu.
</P>
<P>
   The dark-of-night mission, flown repeatedly in the final two
years of World War II to tie down a portion of the Japanese air
force, became known as the Empire Express, and the men who flew it
were called ''bats.''
</P>
<P>
   Parlier's job was to chart and photograph weather formations
along the route, where storms were so hazardous that only one of
the five aircraft from Parlier's squadron completed the mission
that night.
</P>
<P>
   Of the other four, one crashed shortly after takeoff from Attu,
two failed to reach the target and had to turn back, and Parlier's
vanished. It was not until a Russian historian, Alla Paperno, told
U.S. officials last year that wreckage of an American bomber had
been found that the mystery began to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, U.S. officials traveled to the crash site on the
slope of a volcano on Russia's Kamchatka Peninsula and confirmed
that the wreckage was Parlier's plane. It may have been hit by
Japanese anti-aircraft fire and attempted to make an emergency
landing on a Soviet air strip at nearby Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky.
</P>
<P>
   Some human remains were found, but U.S. forensics specialists
plan to return to the site next summer for a full-scale excavation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a real high priority,'' Roland Lajoie,
chairman of the U.S.-Russia Joint Commission on POW/MIAs, said this
week. The retired Army general led the expedition to the crash site
in August.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Navy is trying -- without much success -- to
find relatives of Parlier and the six other crewmen. Dave Greco,
head of the casualty assistance branch at Navy Personnel Command,
said Monday the Navy wants to find the nearest possible relative to
let them know that remains have been found.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually the Navy may ask for blood samples from a relative in
the maternal blood line so that mitochondrial DNA testing can be
done on bones recovered from the crash site, Greco said in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
   So far the Navy has been contacted by family members of two of
the crewmen -- co-pilot Lt. John W. Hanlon Jr. of Worcester, Mass.,
and mechanic Donald Graham Lewallen of Omaha, Neb. Searches of
public records, telephone directories and the Internet have failed
to turn up relatives of the others, Greco said.
</P>
<P>
   The other men are the pilot, Lt. Walter S. Whitman of
Philadelphia, and three enlisted men: Samuel Leslie Crown Jr. of
Columbus, Ohio; Clarence Crome Fridley of Manhattan, Mont., and
James Stephen Palko of Superior, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Parlier not only had never flown in combat, he had never flown,
period, Carrigan recalled in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was eager, charged up, looking forward to it,'' he said.
Carrigan supervised Parlier at the weather office on Attu and
remembers him as ''a neat kid, bright-eyed, apple cheeks, full of
enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Parlier's home of record was Decatur, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   Will Swinney, a retired Navy radioman who was a member of the
same squadron on Attu, VB-139, said planes and ships were sent to
try to rescue the lost crew but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Swinney says he still has an uneasy feeling that not all members
of the crew died in the crash. Tokyo Rose, the voice of Japanese
propaganda broadcasts to Allied troops during the war, was heard to
report after the plane went missing that Japan had possession of
the flight jackets of Whitman, the pilot, and Hanlon, the co-pilot,
Swinney said. Others heard slightly different versions, but all
said Tokyo Rose referred to Hanlon as ''Moose'' Hanlon, which was
his nickname, instead of his given name, John.
</P>
<P>
   ''How would they know that?'' Swinney wonders.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers: Money For I-495 Is Short  </HEADLINE>
By GARRETT THEROLF
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Maryland members of Congress said Wednesday
they doubt they will get all of the federal money in next year's
budget needed to complete a $1.9 billion project for relieving a
round-the-clock bottleneck on the major East Coast highway from
Canada to Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmakers told members of Maryland's state legislature they
still hope to win just enough money to continue work on replacing
the six-lane Woodrow Wilson drawbridge on the Interstate 95/495
beltway just south of Washington with a 12-lane span.
</P>
<P>
   So far Congress has appropriated $900 million for the project
and Maryland and Virginia have agreed to spend another $200 million
each.
</P>
<P>
   While contending that the bridge is ''national responsibility''
rather than a state one, Rep. Connie Morella, R-Md., said there is
widespread bipartisan opposition in Congress to picking up all of
the remaining tab.
</P>
<P>
   Sens. Barbara Mikulski and Paul Sarbanes, both D-Md., said they
were trying to win enough money in an appropriations bill to keep
the project going. The two states, however, have not made clear how
much that would be, an aide to Sarbanes said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The chairmen of the relevant subcommittees are not sympathetic
to it,'' Sarbanes said. ''I can't tell how that's going to come out
..., the amount of time left is extremely limited.''
</P>
<P>
   Construction on the Maryland side of the bridge over the Potomac
River has already begun after Sen. John Warner, R-Va., won a waiver
from the Environmental Protection Agency this summer. Courts had
ruled that under the federal Clean Air Act, all of the funds had to
be in place before ground could be broken on the project.

<HEADLINE> Rescued Cubans Arrive in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- The remaining eight Cuban survivors of a
plane crash in the Gulf of Mexico were brought to Key West for
medical evaluations Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A ninth survivor was already being treated at a Key West
hospital for head and neck injuries.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubans showed little emotion as they quietly walked or were
carried off a Coast Guard cutter before flashing cameras after
nearly two days at sea.
</P>
<P>
   One woman was brought off in a neck brace, and another woman was
placed on a stretcher. A woman in a U.S.A. T-shirt, two men and
three children also walked off the ship; one of the children held
the hand of a rescuer worker.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to bring the remaining survivors ashore was based
on their medical conditions, said Coast Guard spokesman Marc
Woodring. He said one woman has cuts on her hands and legs, another
woman may have a broken collarbone, and the third woman may have a
broken rib.
</P>
<P>
   ''We just want to be prudent, want to make sure they were
getting everything they needed,'' said Petty Officer Scott Carr.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. law lets Cubans apply for residency if they reach U.S.
soil. Ordinarily, those who are picked up at sea are returned to
Cuba, but authorities said it was too early to say what would
happen with the nine plane crash survivors.
</P>
<P>
   All nine survivors were being treated or evaluated at Florida
Lower Keys Hospital early Thursday. The body of another man, found
after the plane went down Tuesday, was also brought to shore for an
autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   None of their names was officially released Wednesday, but
family and friends who met the survivors at the hospital identified
those on board the plane as Liliana Ponzoa, 36; her son Andy
Fuentes, 6; Jacquelin Viera, 28; Yudel Puig, 24; his brother Pavel
Puig, 28; Rodolfo Fuentes, 36; Lenin Iglesias Hernandez, who has
been identified as the pilot, his wife Mercedes Martinez, 34, and
their sons Erik, 13, and Danny, 7.
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes, who had serious head and neck injuries, was air-lifted
Tuesday from the Panamanian-flagged freighter that had rescued the
plane's passengers after the crash. Doctors said he was in stable
condition Wednesday and doing well.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. authorities interviewed Fuentes, but officials said details
of the interview were being withheld until the investigation was
finished.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI said Wednesday the Cuban plane doesn't appear to have
been hijacked, as Cuban officials said the pilot had reported, but
the agency is withholding a final determination until it questions
the eight survivors.
</P>
<P>
   ''We still need to interview the people on the ship before we
can rule out a hijacking,'' said Judy Orihuela, an FBI spokeswoman
in Miami. ''At this point, it doesn't appear to be a hijacking, but
until we interview them we can't be sure.''
</P>
<P>
   Once the FBI determines whether the plane was hijacked or flown
from Cuba voluntarily, immigration officials will be able to
determine if the survivors should qualify for asylum in the United
States. U.S. authorities have returned hijackers to Cuba for
prosecution and have prosecuted some in this country.

   ''If they pass the credible fear test they will be taken to
Guantanamo Bay (the U.S. base at the eastern end of Cuba). If they
do not, they will be repatriated to Cuba,'' said Maria Cardona, a
spokeswoman for the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   The credible fear test requires would-be immigrants to
demonstrate a fear of persecution in their home country ''based on
nationality, race, religion, political opinion or membership in a
particular social group.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the status of Fuentes, Cardona noted that he is
now on U.S. soil and eligible to stay.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Reps. Lincoln Diaz-Balart and Ileana Ros-Lehtinen,
Cuban-American lawmakers from Miami, wrote to President Clinton on
Wednesday asking that all nine Cubans be granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly they will face persecution in Cuba for their
involvement in such a high-profile and risky attempt to flee the
island,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government had said the pilot reported to the control
tower that he was being hijacked and that the plane, a
Russian-built government crop-duster, was headed to Florida with a
group of adults and children.
</P>
<P>
   A statement from the Cuban government, published Wednesday in
the Communist Party daily Granma, said that pilot Lenin Iglesias
Hernandez apparently first took off in the plane at 7:35 a.m.
Tuesday from a small airstrip for what appeared to be a routine
crop-dusting flight. It said he flew to another airport, picked up
a group of people waiting at the end of a runway, then took off
again at 8:35 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   The plane crashed in the southern Gulf of Mexico about 50 miles
west of Cuba and 285 miles from Key West. The Coast Guard said the
craft was heading west, toward Mexico, when it went down.

<HEADLINE> Effects of Calif. Casinos Weighed  </HEADLINE>
By KIMBERLY LAMKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Representatives from 17 area American Indian
tribes sat down with county officials to discuss the environmental
and economic effects of a major expansion of tribal gambling.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes want to add nine casinos to a county that's about
4,200 square miles. Three tribal casinos already operate in San
Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   All the county's American Indian lands are in unincorporated
areas and few have the roads, water service and sewers necessary to
accommodate large commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
   The county Board of Supervisors wants to ensure that
environmental and infrastructure problems are handled fairly. Also
of concern for local officials is providing adequate fire and law
enforcement services.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's extremely important to begin this dialogue with the
tribes now,'' said Board of Supervisors Chairwoman Dianne Jacob.
''Discussions on improving their infrastructure before putting
these developments in unincorporated areas could prevent
environmental and infrastructure problems of large proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribal leaders say gambling centers will not be added in a way
that harms the environment. They say the facilities will help
provide for the needs of their tribes, and bring money and new jobs
to San Diego County as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   ''Tribal governments have the opportunity to be self-sufficient
through commercial activity, mainly gaming,'' said Rincon San
Luiseno Band Chairman John Currier. ''I hope the county will
emphasize the positive regional economic benefits of what is
happening within reservation communities.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 1A, passed by California voters in March, allows a
federally recognized tribe to operate slot machines, lottery games
and card games on its lands, provided the governor has approved a
gambling compact with the group.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's meeting was the first between the county officials
and representatives from all 17 tribes.
</P>
<P>
   Jacob has proposed that one person be appointed to serve as a
tribal liaison for the county board, and that a committee of two
supervisors and a few tribal leaders meet again in the next month.

<HEADLINE> Groups Working To Get Out the Vote  </HEADLINE>
By JONATHAN D. SALANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- From the nation's largest civil rights
organization to the construction industry's trade association,
interest groups will spend the remaining weeks before Election Day
trying to water the grass roots instead of flooding the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Though these organizations still intend to spend record amounts
on issue advertisements, they also are diverting substantial sums
of money away from television and pouring it into efforts to
organize supporters and get them out to vote on Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   ''The money's important in campaigns, but you need to get people
out to vote and get activated,'' said Bill Spencer, vice president
for government affairs for Associated Builders and Contractors, the
construction trade group and traditional Republican ally. ''You can
spend the money, but unless they go to the polls, it's not going to
help you much.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurring these groups to act is the fact that control of the
White House and both houses of Congress are up for grabs, plus the
possibility that the next president may appoint several Supreme
Court justices.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a crucial election. There's so much at stake. We
wanted to use all the modern tools and so we decided to put on this
extra effort,'' said Julian Bond, the veteran civil rights leader
who heads the board of directors of the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People, whose members traditionally
support Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP has formed a new organization -- the NAACP National
Voter Fund -- with a $9 million budget to target black voters in 12
key states.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the new group has registered 21,000 voters and signed
up 2,345 volunteers to make phone calls, knock on doors and do
other grass-roots organizing, Bond said.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, organized labor showed how successful such a
program could be.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than spend millions of dollars on advertising, the unions
went into key congressional districts, distributed literature, made
phone calls and got their members to the polls. On Election Day,
Democrats gained seats in the House and broke even in the Senate,
reversing a decades-old trend that saw the party occupying the
White House losing seats in off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the AFL-CIO has committees in 71 congressional
districts in 25 states to distribute literature and buttonhole
union members.
</P>
<P>
   ''The person-to-person contact is the most effective way to
communicate our message,'' said Daniel Weiss, political director of
the Sierra Club, an environmental organization that has allocated
$8 million for the fall campaigns, half of it to be spent on
grass-roots organizing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Television is an important communication tool, but it's a
rather impersonal one,'' Weiss said. ''The other side may have the
big checkbooks but we have the shoe leather. That is more
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, which traditionally supports Democrats, has its
own scorecards to distribute in 20 congressional districts, plus
field organizers to help get out the vote. In the last three weeks
before Election Day, it plans to have people in 50 districts.
</P>
<P>
   Such a strategy has worked in the past. The AFL-CIO said 76
percent of union members who received election-related information
voted for the labor-backed candidate in 1998, as compared with 58
percent who did not receive any information. So the labor
federation hopes to double the percentage of its members who
receive fliers from the union to 22 percent from 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The business community, a traditional Republican ally, also is
working the streets.
</P>
<P>
   Associated Builders and Contractors suggests its 22,000 member
companies invite candidates to construction sites so their 1
million employees can meet them. It also is urging company
executives to include literature in payroll envelopes comparing the
voting records of the trade group-endorsed candidates and their
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Other suggestions from the construction trade group to its
members: Contribute the wood and labor needed to build candidate
booths for county fairs; conduct voter registration drives at work;
and give employees a shorter work day on Election Day so they can
go to the polls.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the nation's largest business
lobby, plans to blanket 3 million business owners with mailings
promoting its endorsed candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The chamber also has joined several other powerful business
groups, including the National Restaurant Association, National
Association of Manufacturers and Business-Industry Political Action
Committee, to provide business owners and executives with
information they can use to urge their colleagues and employees to
support pro-business candidates.

<HEADLINE> Whitewater Targets Criticize Probe  </HEADLINE>
By JAMES JEFFERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Arkansans are saying ''I told you so''
one more time after Independent Counsel Robert Ray decided
President Clinton and wife Hillary Rodham Clinton should not be
indicted in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But it's a hollow victory for more than a dozen state residents
who were caught and convicted in the limelight of a national
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In wrapping up the most expensive independent counsel inquiry in
history, Ray, who succeeded Kenneth Starr, issued a statement
Wednesday saying there was ''insufficient'' or ''inconclusive''
evidence to warrant charges against the president and first lady in
the six-year, $52 million probe.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McDougal, a former Clinton business partner who spent 18
months in jail for refusing to cooperate with Starr, lashed out at
the investigation and criticized Ray for what she said was a
lukewarm absolution of the Clintons.
</P>
<P>
   ''After they've gathered all of the evidence, all the documents
they said they couldn't find, all the testimony they said they
didn't have -- I answered every question at my trial -- they still
cannot come back as men and say there is no guilt there,'' McDougal
said.
</P>
<P>
   She said of Starr, ''I believe him to be a man of no
integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   McDougal and her ex-husband, the now-deceased Jim McDougal, were
the Clintons' partners in the failed 1978 Whitewater land deal that
lent Starr's wide-ranging investigation its name. The McDougals and
then-Gov. Jim Guy Tucker were convicted of bank fraud May 28, 1996,
in the first Whitewater trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen other Arkansans were charged in the probe, largely with
white-collar crimes unrelated to the Clintons' business dealings
that were the original focus of the probe. Most pleaded guilty to
misdemeanor or felony charges ranging from misapplication of a
federal loan to defrauding the federal Small Business
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mike Huckabee said investigations conducted under the
Whitewater banner exposed criminal activity and corruption.
</P>
<P>
   ''But the process left scars on not just the guilty but many
innocent people as well,'' Huckabee said. ''Everyone feels relieved
this chapter of our state's history has concluded.''
</P>
<P>
   Bankers Herby Branscum Jr. and Robert Hill, owners of the Perry
County Bank in Perryville, were accused of illegally funneling
money from their bank to Clinton's campaigns for governor and
president.
</P>
<P>
   They were acquitted on the most serious charges, and the jury
deadlocked on the several others. Starr eventually dropped the
case.
</P>
<P>
   ''It should never have been started,'' Branscum said, accusing
Starr of using heavy-handed tactics to bully innocent Arkansans.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think these people who worked for Kenneth Starr know
what fairness is about. I wasn't treated fairly and I don't think
anyone else who had to deal with those people were treated
fairly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan McDougal was sentenced to two years in prison but did not
begin serving the time for 18 months -- first she had to serve time
for contempt for refusing to answer questions about Clinton before
the Whitewater grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   She completed her contempt term March 9, 1998, and began her
Whitewater prison term. The following June, a judge reduced her
prison term to time served because she had health problems. She
still faced a criminal contempt indictment for again refusing to
talk to a grand jury about Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   She was acquitted of an unrelated California embezzlement charge
in November 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, a federal jury deadlocked on the two criminal
contempt charges and acquitted McDougal on an obstruction of
justice charge. The judge declared a mistrial on the contempt
charges. Starr's office opted not to retry the case. Her former
husband died in a federal prison in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   McDougal now cares for her ailing parents in Camden when she's
not traveling the country lecturing about women in prison.

<HEADLINE> Stock Prices Keep Slipping  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks opened lower Thursday amid lingering
gloom on Wall Street about corporate profits and higher oil prices.
The drop threatened to end a high-tech rally from the previous two
sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again unloaded stocks of companies that issued
warnings of disappointing profits. Even a report by one of Wall
Street's most prominent analysts that the economy remains quite
favorable for the markets failed to halt the early selling.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow opened down 14.80 at
10,673.12.
</P>
<P>
   Broader indicators were also lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 31.53 to 3,865.91 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 6.57
at 1,444.77.
</P>
<P>
   In a report Thursday, Goldman Sachs analyst Abby Joseph Cohen
said she believes high oil prices, the weak European currency and
corporate profit concerns ''will be short-lived.'' She also
reiterated that U.S. economic conditions remain quite favorable,
particularly in the areas of improved productivity and government
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But her words didn't calm investors, who have become accustomed
to stock market declines in September.
</P>
<P>
   With third-quarter earnings season just a few weeks away and
increasing signs that the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have
been punishing stocks whose companies fail to meet their
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Tire maker Goodyear fell $2.44 to $18.56 after the company
warned its quarterly earnings would be sluggish because of higher
oil prices and the weak euro, Europe's chief currency.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index fell 2.50 to 518.93.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.89 percent. In
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was down 2.15 percent,
Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 1.25 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off
2.03 percent.

<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday amid lingering gloom
on Wall Street about corporate profits and higher oil prices. The
uncertainty threatened to end a high-tech rally from the previous
two sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again unloaded stocks of companies that issued
warnings of disappointing profits. Even a report by one of Wall
Street's most prominent analysts that the economy remains quite
favorable for the markets failed to halt the early selling.
</P>
<P>
   In the first hour of trading, the Dow moved up 7.40 to
10,695.32.
</P>
<P>
   But broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 24.63 to 3,872.81 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 6.30
at 1,445.04.
</P>
<P>
   In a report Thursday, Goldman Sachs analyst Abby Joseph Cohen
said she believes high oil prices, the weak European currency and
corporate profit concerns ''will be short-lived.'' She also
reiterated that U.S. economic conditions remain quite favorable,
particularly in the areas of improved productivity and government
policy.
</P>
<P>
   But her words didn't calm investors, who have become accustomed
to stock market declines in September.

<HEADLINE> Dying Prohibited in Riviera Town  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Renowned for its breathtaking scenery, pine trees,
rocky coastline and a clear blue Mediterranean Sea, the Riviera
town of Le Lavandou is drawing headlines for a new local law that
makes dying a grave offense.
</P>
<P>
   The town's only cemetery is full, and the project for a new one
near the coast was rejected earlier this month by a regional court,
which ruled that the plan violated a law on sea shore
constructions.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the lack of cemetery space, Le Lavandou, 25 miles east of
Toulon, on Tuesday passed a law: ''It is forbidden without a
cemetery plot to die on the territory of the commune.''
</P>
<P>
   Currently, 19 people are awaiting a final resting place. Since
the deceased were unable to secure a cemetery plot, they are
temporarily being ''hosted'' in friends' vaults.
</P>
<P>
   Under the town's planning code, the coastal graveyard project
did not qualify as using ''light equipment,'' which is authorized
on sea shores.
</P>
<P>
   A group of ecologists took the town project to court and
proposed an alternative location -- a rock quarry in a less
populated part of town
</P>
<P>
   Le Lavandou's Mayor, Gil Bernardi, is fiercely opposed. He
likened the quarry to a ''dump'' that does not respect the dead. In
a telephone interview, he acknowledged the ruling against dying was
''absurd'' but insisted it was ''enacted because of an absurd
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there would be -- obviously -- no punishment for those
found breaking the law.
</P>
<P>
   The cemetery crisis has been brewing for three years and could
continue for some time, Bernardi said. The appeal procedure to
overturn the regional court ruling could last up to three years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, only about half of the 80 people or so who die each
year in Le Lavandou will do so legally as plot owners.

<HEADLINE> At Bunim-Murray, Reality TV Not New  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID BAUDER
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Unless you look a little closer, it seems the
garbage collector missed a stop in the lobby of the Bunim/Murray
Productions office.
</P>
<P>
   A colorfully decorated cereal box stands on display. There's a
roll of toilet paper filled with neat handwriting. A globe. A
champagne bottle. Even a graffiti-filled door is propped against a
wall.
</P>
<P>
   It's a messy tribute to the ingenuity of MTV viewers, who sent
each of those items -- along with thousands of videotapes and
letters -- as applications to join ''The Real World,'' which is
produced here.
</P>
<P>
   Now in its ninth season, ''The Real World'' is an elder
statesman in the reality television business. Watch this series
about self-obsessed twentysomethings crammed in a house after an
episode of CBS' ''Big Brother,'' and you'll think you've stumbled
upon Shakespeare.
</P>
<P>
   More mailbags of pleading notes and tapes are due soon, since
MTV just signed on for two more years. ABC has also requested more
episodes of Bunim/Murray's ''Making the Band'' and another series,
''Love Cruise,'' is being readied for Fox this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're excited that reality is finally getting its due, that
networks are taking it seriously,'' said Jonathan Murray. ''There
were many years when network presidents, quite honestly, weren't
interested in what we had to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Murray and partner Mary-Ellis Bunim are in the middle of a
gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   Bunim, a former soap opera producer, and Murray, who made news
documentaries, stepped in when MTV decided in the early 1990s that
it could not live on music videos alone. The network wanted its own
soap opera but found it too expensive, so Bunim and Murray
convinced them there's enough drama in real lives.
</P>
<P>
   There's actually much that's unreal about college-age youths
staying in luxurious homes in such locales as Hawaii, Miami or San
Francisco. But viewers are eager to see how combustible characters
interact at a naturally tumultuous point in their lives. Through
this season, ''The Real World'' has the unusual distinction of
growing in the ratings each year.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you think about the generation that watches TV now, they've
grown up not only on 'The Real World' but on Oprah and Jerry
Springer,'' said Brian Graden, MTV's programming president.
''They're used to real people parading their dramas out in front of
people as entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's also the first generation to come of age with mass
distribution of video recorders. Some people are surprised that
it's taken off, but for the people who are 25 and 30 and even 35
like myself, we grew up watching this kind of TV. Our parents
watched dramas.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the memorable characters on ''The Real World'' include
the obnoxious Puck from San Francisco; Pedro Zamora, who died of
AIDS at 22; and Ruthie, the 21-year-old Hawaiian who was sent to
rehab last season when her drinking went out of control.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bunim and Murray wear out VCRs trying to find the right mix
of people each season.
</P>
<P>
   ''You're only as good as your cast, and we spend a lot of time
choosing our cast,'' Bunim said. ''We don't scrimp on that time.''
</P>
<P>
   They also spend three to five months after the series is filmed
crafting a story, much like the producers of ''Survivor'' this
summer. For every foot of film, 200 feet are left in the cutting
room. Writers are used, not to concoct a story, but to look at the
mounds of material and see the stories hidden inside.
</P>
<P>
   ''Fundamental, centuries-old storytelling is really universal,
no matter what form it is, and they brought it to reality,'' Graden
said. ''Watching paint dry, as you do on other shows, really isn't
that interesting.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did somebody mention ''Big Brother'' again?
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no question that we could have done it better. But,
whatever ... ,'' Bunim said, her voice trailing off.
</P>
<P>
   The producers said they were consulted on ''Big Brother,'' but
didn't want to get more involved, believing that wouldn't be fair
to MTV because the premise was so close to ''The Real World.'' They
can see the same mistakes most CBS viewers notice every day --
lackluster cast, ugly home and contrived situations.
</P>
<P>
   ''What they do that we can't do is they manipulate the people,''
Bunim said. ''They're so worried about how it's going that they, on
a daily basis, are throwing things in to stir the pot. We learned
early on that it just makes people paranoid.''
</P>
<P>
   Bunim/Murray also produces ''Road Rules'' for MTV, which places
a group of youngsters in a bus for a series of adventures and
competition. They mix and match casts from both shows for spinoffs
and even sell a video: ''The Real World's Greatest Fights.''
</P>
<P>
   They're looking to diversify, making a movie for CBS starring
Valerie Bertinelli, and are producing a series for ABC about the
start-up of an Internet site.
</P>
<P>
   Either Murray or Bunim will spend much of the fall on a ship to
supervise ''Love Cruise.'' The series brings eight men and eight
women together on a boat, who get together in separate groups each
episode to vote one member of the opposite sex off the boat.
</P>
<P>
   They're trying not to run ragged as the reality TV boomlet stays
afloat.
</P>
<P>
   ''Going down the road, a lot of it is going to cancel each other
out,'' Bunim said. ''We think our method of storytelling will
prevail and sustain long-term.''
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> GAO Questions Contract Awards  </HEADLINE>
By JESSE J. HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congressional investigators said a federal
agency that guarantees pensions when employers go bankrupt awarded
$40 million in contracts to a friend of one of its executives.
</P>
<P>
   But Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp.'s executive director said the
agency has investigated the charges and cannot prove them.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Thursday that Bennie Hagans, the agency's
insurance operations director, had a close relationship with
Integrated Management Resources Group, a company owned by one of
his friends.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hagans' actions ... demonstrated a lack of impartiality
with respect to IMRG and created the appearance of improperly
influencing the award of the two contracts we investigated,'' said
Robert Hast, assistant comptroller general for the office of
special investigations at the General Accounting Office, the
investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Hast said the matter would be referred to the Justice
Department.
</P>
<P>
   ''Possible contract steering is a serious matter that must be
thoroughly investigated,'' said Sen. Christopher Bond, R-Mo.,
chairman of the Senate Small Business Committee. ''I believe OSI's
decision to refer this matter to the Justice Department is on
target.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was released Thursday at a joint hearing of the
Senate Special Committee on Aging and the Small Business Committee.
</P>
<P>
   PBGC Executive Director David Strauss said the allegations have
been investigated for the past three years. ''No one has been able
to substantiate any allegations of misconduct,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO report said between April 1997 when IMRG chief Myrna
Cooks started her company and October 1997, Hagans made 34 calls to
her home, where the new firm was based. Cooks told GAO officials
those calls concerned personnel problems at her old company but
could not provide examples.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Hagans was similarly unable to explain the contents of the
many telephone conversations that he had had with Ms. Cooks,'' the
report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said a Maryland bank officer with whom IMRG
tried to get a loan contacted Hagans. In his notes from the
discussion, the bank officer said, ''Mr. Hagans had said he 'was a
very big fan of Myrna's (Ms. Cooks) and politicked within the
agency for her company to receive the bid,''' the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   Hagans told the GAO he did not remember speaking to the bank
officer but if he had, it ''may look wrong'' and in hindsight it
would have been ''bad judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp., created in 1974, protects the
retirements of 42 million workers against the bankruptcy of their
employers.
</P>
<P>
   Pension recipients complained at the hearing about getting
erroneous payments for hundreds of dollars. But after returning the
checks, they would get tax notices from the Internal Revenue
Service and the pension corporation would reduce their future
payments based on the errant checks. Others said it took years for
the agency to tell them how much pension money they could expect
when they retired.
</P>
<P>
   Strauss said his agency was continuing to make improvements
suggested by the committees and the GAO. ''I'm pleased to report to
you that we have already implemented most of the and we are
following up on the rest,'' he said.

   HANOVER, Germany (AP) -- Harry Potter is going to school. Not
Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but the University of

<P>
   Professor Martin-Christoph Just plans to offer a seminar titled
''The Harry Potter Phenomenon'' starting in November to determine
the secret behind the success of the four-book series by author
J.K. Rowling.
</P>
<P>
   The class will look at whether the book is a totally new idea or
a remake on the idea of a ''poor orphan seeks his fortune''
combined with school stories and fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   Also discussed will be the ideological aspects of the book and
the marketing strategy that has rocketed it to the top of
best-seller lists all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is certain that these books satisfy the wishful imaginings
of readers that everyone can do magic,'' Just said Thursday.

   In morning trading, the Dow moved up 23.68 to 10,711.60, a

sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 36.18 to 3,861.26 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 5.46

</P>
<P>
   ''You've got some stocks that are up and pushing the Dow higher,
but in general the market remains down,'' said Barry Berman, head
trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. ''It's the end of the quarter and
right now the concerns are oil prices and earnings.''

   Most other stocks slipped. With the third-quarter earnings
reporting season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that
the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks
whose companies fail to meet their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices also have investors worried. The price of a
barrel on crude on the New York Merchantile Exchange was $35.45,
down from the $37 range it reached in recent days, but still at
levels not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Tire maker Goodyear fell $2.06 to $18.94 after the company
warned that its quarterly earnings would be sluggish because of
higher oil prices and the weak euro, Europe's chief currency.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter traded down $10.13 at $85.81 after
the brokerage firm's third-quarter earnings failed to meet Wall
Street expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market's search for sure bets meant that even companies that
beat analyst estimates were vulnerable. Investment bank Lehman
Brothers fell $6.50 to $137.94, primarily on profit-taking, a day
after its quarterly profits trounced analyst expectations by 62

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Conservation Bill OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton turned up the heat Thursday
on the Senate in urging approval of a landmark conservation bill
stalled by a minority of vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by environmental leaders from groups including Defenders
of Wildlife and the Chesapeake Bay Foundation, Clinton said the
country could no longer take its open spaces and wildlife for
granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have a unique and profoundly important effort to give
people at the grassroots level in America a permanent source of
funding to protect our natural resources,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ''With more and more people visiting our national parks and
forests, we also have to do more to protect and preserve these
treasures.''
</P>
<P>
   The bill would provide $3 billion a year for 15 years for buying
land, restoring coastlines and protecting wildlife. The money would
come from oil and gas leases, primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and
off Alaska.
</P>
<P>
   The House overwhelmingly approved a version of the bill. But the
bill remains controversial because budgeters oppose locking in
spending for 15 years and some Republicans oppose the government
buying more land in the West.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement came two days after 63 senators sent a
letter to Senate leaders urging a vote. That majority ensured
supporters could prevent a filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents, including Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. chairman of
the Budget Committee, say they will still try to kill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., who supports the
bill, has said negotiations are continuing to try and approve the
measure.
</P>

In ongoing Baptist battle, Texans weigh big funding cut for
seminaries
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS (AP) -- The Texas unit of the Southern Baptist Convention
is considering cuts of more than $5 million from funding of
denominational seminaries and other agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal is being pushed by those in the Baptist General
Convention of Texas who oppose strict conservative control over
agencies in the biggest U.S. Protestant body. The plan goes before
a Texas board meeting Tuesday and, if passed, to a statewide
Baptist meeting Oct. 30-31.
</P>
<P>
   Texas accounts for 17 percent of SBC members and 13 percent of
the funding for denominational agencies.
</P>
<P>
   The affected schools are in Fort Worth, Texas; Kansas City, Mo.;
Louisville, Ky.; Mill Valley, Calif.; New Orleans; and Wake Forest,
N.C. The plan would shift funding to seminaries at Baylor
University and Hardin-Simmons University and the Hispanic Baptist
Theological School, all in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   SBC President James Merritt, a Georgia pastor, sees ''seeds of
destruction'' in the proposal.
</P>

In case of disabled pope, church needs new canon law, expert says
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Roman Catholicism needs the equivalent of the
25th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, specifying what to do if
the pope is ever incapable of governing, an expert in church law
said.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of rules is ''a rather serious vacuum'' in church law,
according to the Rev. James H. Provost of Catholic University, who
wrote an article for the current America magazine shortly before
his death Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   By definition, a pope suffering a severe stroke or mental
illness cannot simply step down, because canon law specifies a
person must be of sound mind to resign a church office.
</P>
<P>
   Some think the Holy Spirit wouldn't allow such a crisis, Provost
wrote, but the mental illness of Pope Urban VI (1378-89) forced
cardinals to elect a second pope, causing the disastrous Western
Schism. He said new law is needed ''to avoid cries of foul play or
even another schism.''
</P>
<P>
   A bishop designates an aide who takes over if he is impeded.
With a pope, Provost suggested, this might be his vicar who runs
the Rome diocese or the chamberlain the pope chooses to administer
the Vatican after he dies.
</P>
<P>
   Who decides when a pope must be sidelined? Provost thought the
chamberlain is the logical person.
Episcopal court finds bishop guilty of sexual exploitation
</P>
<P>
   HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A rare Episcopal Church court has ruled
that Montana Bishop Charles I. Jones III sexually exploited a
female parishioner years ago, which could result in his suspension
or removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   The bishop contends he is being punished twice for the same
offense and intends to fight the conviction. A second church court
will convene Nov. 28 on that issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jones was a priest in Russellville, Ky., in 1981 when he began
an affair with a woman parishioner. Both were married at the time.
In 1993, Jones, by then Montana's bishop, admitted the affair. The
following year Montana church delegates rejected a call for his
resignation.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1997 the Kentucky woman filed a complaint against Jones
after the church revised canon law to lengthen the statute of
limitations for complaints against clergy.
</P>
<P>
   The church's Ecclesiastical Trial Court ruled Jones guilty of
immorality and conduct unbecoming the clergy. The decision was
based on legal briefs, without hearing testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' attorney said the court's decision constitutes double
jeopardy, since the bishop was already required to apologize and
undergo therapy. The church contends that did not amount to
punishment.
Work begins toward an all-encompassing world Christian
organization
</P>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- Representatives from the World Council
of Churches met Roman Catholic, evangelical Protestant and
Pentecostal leaders to discuss creating a ''global Christian
forum'' to encompass as many of the world's Christians as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The World Council's 1998 assembly originated the idea of a
loosely organized meeting ground to include its own Protestant and
Orthodox members along with those outside the council, principally
Catholics, evangelicals and Pentecostals.
</P>
<P>
   After the international meeting at Fuller Theological Seminary,
an evangelical school, the 30 participants released a communique
saying the forum would foster practices to ''enable us to handle
our Christian differences ... creatively and peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   A new committee, independent of the World Council, is
coordinating the forum project. Members include representatives of
the Vatican Council for Promoting Christian Unity, the Russian
Orthodox Church and the evangelical movement.

Methodist named to head Church World Service
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The National Council of Churches has named the
Rev. John L. McCullough the new executive director of its
international relief agency, Church World Service. He formerly
supervised foreign mission personnel with the United Methodist
Church, the council's largest member denomination.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, National Council officials settled a long-running
dispute by granting the relief agency independent financial
control. The agency had complained about the cost and quality of
administration by the council.

By JAY LINDSAY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON (AP) -- A nervous groom standing at the altar, waiting for
his bride. An emotional dad giving away his daughter. A priest
reciting the vows as the couple looks into each other's eyes.
</P>
<P>
   All these cherished moments in a Roman Catholic wedding are
out-of-date, according to the church's own liturgy, something the
producers of a new video hope to change.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-one years after the Second Vatican Council recommended
sweeping changes in marriage ceremonies, the wedding rites have
remained virtually unaltered. Even some priests are unfamiliar with
Vatican II's suggestions.
</P>
<P>
   The hope is that the video, featuring a couple from the Boston
suburb of Milton, will demystify the ''new'' rites for couples wary
of the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our feeling is that a picture is worth a thousand words,''
said Maria Leonard, the video's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   The video was produced by Liturgy Training Publications, which
is under the jurisdiction of the Archdiocese of Chicago. The
company shot in Massachusetts to accommodate the Rev. Austin
Fleming of Concord, who has written a book on the new rites,
Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   The stars are Jim and Denise Ryan, who used the new liturgy at
their November wedding.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes highlighted: Dad doesn't give the bride away --
she walks down the aisle with the groom. And the couple administers
their own vows, with the priest serving merely as an observer.
</P>
<P>
   Taping took place in July at St. Peter's in Cambridge. Seven
hours of shooting were witnessed by the Ryans' friends who stood in
as guests.
</P>
<P>
   In the video, the Ryans walk down the aisle together,
symbolizing their equal role in making the marriage work. The
guests become involved through songs and readings, and the couple
turns toward them as they recite their own vows.
</P>
<P>
   The emphasis on equality and the active role of the community in
supporting a marriage gives the couple a good start and is more
scripturally sound than the old rites, Fleming said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Theologically it speaks better to what we're about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Denise Ryan said it was fun re-enacting their November wedding,
but she had a higher purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope it just opens up the idea that there might be a deeper
expression of what's happening, a deeper expression of God's
love,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The older rites are based on views that the church no longer
accepts, said Lisa Cahill, a theology professor at Boston College,
a Catholic school.
</P>
<P>
   The practice of the father giving away a bride used to signal a
type of transfer of ownership and the veil covering the bride's
face was once meant to show the bride's purity, Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the new marriage rites haven't caught on shows
Catholics were not clamoring for new wedding rituals and they don't
associate the symbols with their original meanings, Cahill said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They just connect the bride and the couple with the traditions
of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Fleming doesn't think there's an active resistance to the new
wedding rites. Many people, including priests, simply aren't
familiar with them, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's how ingrained (the traditional wedding rite) is,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Many people still enjoy a traditional wedding, and Fleming said
he never pushes couples to follow the new rites. But he always
suggests the new liturgy, and hopes people's questions will be
answered by the video -- expected to be available in Catholic
churches in January.
</P>
<P>
   The slow acceptance of the new rites doesn't surprise him,
Fleming said, especially in a church with a reputation for slow
change.
</P>
<P>
   ''Thirty-one years in a calendar of 2,000?'' he said, laughing.
''That's a drop in the bucket.''

<HEADLINE> Millennium Music to Premiere  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI, Ohio (AP) -- A piece of music commissioned by 27
orchestras premieres here Friday, performed by the Cincinnati
Symphony, conducted by Jesus Lopez Cobos.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many new pieces of music, ''The Millennium Fantasy for
Piano and Orchestra'' won't just be played once and shelved. During
the next two seasons, all 27 orchestras that formed the Millennium
Commissioning Project and commissioned ''Millennium Fantasy'' will
perform it.
</P>
<P>
   The composer is Ellen Taaffe Zwilich, who won the Pulitzer Prize
for music in 1983 for her ''Symphony No. 1.''
</P>
<P>
   The piano soloist is Jeffrey Biegel, who believes this is the
largest number of organizations ever to combine to commission a
piece of classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Upcoming performances of ''The Millennium Fantasy'' through
November will be in Rockford, Ill.; Westmoreland, Pa.; Rogue
Valley, Ore.; Champaign, Ill.; Battle Creek, Mich.; and El Paso,
Texas.

<HEADLINE> Nasdaq Drops 56; Dow Gains 11  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday amid lingering gloom
on Wall Street about corporate profits and higher oil prices. The
uncertainty threatened to end a high-tech rally from the previous
two sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again unloaded stocks of companies that issued
warnings of disappointing profits. Even a report by one of Wall
Street's most prominent analysts that the economy remains quite
favorable for the markets failed to halt the selling.
</P>
<P>
   In midday trading, the Dow moved up 11.10 to 10,699.02, a slight
shift away from the downward momentum of the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 56.08 to 3,841.36 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 10.60
at 1,440.74.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got some stocks that are up and pushing the Dow higher,
but in general the market remains down,'' said Barry Berman, head
trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. ''It's the end of the quarter and
right now the concerns are oil prices and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors did boost Hertz up $6.81 to $31.06 on news that
Ford was interested in buying the stock of the car rental company
that it doesn't already own.
</P>
<P>
   Most other stocks fell. With the third-quarter earnings
reporting season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that
the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks
whose companies fail to meet their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices also have investors worried. The price of a
barrel on crude on the New York Merchantile Exchange was $36.33,
down from the $37 range it reached in recent days, but still at
levels not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Tire maker Goodyear fell $1.69 to $19.31 after the company
warned that its quarterly earnings would be sluggish because of
higher oil prices and the weak euro, Europe's chief currency.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, fears of weakening in the wireless market sent
Ericsson Telephone down $1.19 to $16.81. Sprint, which fell nearly
19 percent Wednesday after it warned of below expectations earning,
continued to fall, dropping $2.88 to $30.13.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter traded down $9.81 at $86.13 after the
brokerage firm's third-quarter earnings failed to meet Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market's search for sure bets meant that even companies that
beat analyst estimates were vulnerable. Investment bank Lehman
Brothers fell $3 to $141.44, primarily on profit-taking, a day
after its quarterly profits trounced analyst expectations by 62
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Even a report by Goldman Sachs analyst Abby Joseph Cohen stating
that high oil prices, the weak euro and corporate profit concerns
will be short-lived failed to calm inevstors. She also reiterated
that U.S. economic conditions remain quite favorable, particularly
in the areas of improved productivity and government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 494.25 million
shares, ahead of the 482.52 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 3.91 at 517.52.

<HEADLINE> 10 Convicted Jews Sentences Reduced  </HEADLINE>
By AFSHIN VALINEJAD
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- An appeals court has reduced the sentences
against 10 Iranian Jews found guilty of spying for Israel, the
judiciary announced Thursday, casting aside two of the three
charges on which they were convicted in a trial that gained
international condemnation.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli and Jewish leaders, who maintain the convicted men are
innocent, immediately criticized the court for not going far
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ''Israel calls upon the international community and every
civilized person to severely condemn these harsh sentences and to
continue working with Israel to achieve the immediate release of
the prisoners,'' the Israeli Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Branch 9 of the appeals court in Fars province, where the Jews
were tried, reduced their prison terms from a range of four to 13
years to terms of two to nine years, provincial judiciary chief
Hossein Ali Amiri said. He said the time already served would be
included in the sentences.
</P>
<P>
   The case, seen as a show of increasing power by the hard-line
clergy in this Muslim country, attracted international attention,
with countries such as the United States and France as well as
human rights organizations and Jewish groups urging Iran to ensure
the trial was fair. Jurists have questioned whether the trial could
be fair when there was no jury and the judge also acted as
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ''It remains now for those same nations to protest the wrongful
upholding of the conviction of those people who are incarcerated,''
said Phil Baum, executive director of the New York-based American
Jewish Congress told The Associated Press in Cairo, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   The Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish
Organizations called the sentence a ''positive step.'' But ''we
remain outraged that after more than one and a half years of harsh
imprisonment ... defendants remain in jail for crimes that the
court itself acknowledges they did not commit,'' chairman Ronald
Lauder and executive vice chairman Malcolm Hoenlein said in a joint
statement.
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court upheld the conviction of cooperating with
Israel but found the 10 men innocent of membership in an illegal
spy ring and recruitment of new agents, Amiri said.
</P>
<P>
   ''These sentences are the lowest possible sentences and we have
used the ultimate of Islamic kindness and generosity. According to
the law, these charges could have brought execution,'' Amiri told
The AP from the southern city of Shiraz, where the trial took
place.
</P>
<P>
   Esmail Naseri, lawyer for the Jews, maintained that none of his
clients is guilty of any of the charges.
</P>
<P>
   ''The court has admitted our argument that all the charges
against the 10 Jews were only one charge, but we still believe that
they are all innocent,'' Naseri told the AP from Shiraz.
</P>
<P>
   Dani Tefilin, a shoe salesman, and Asher Zadmehr, a university
professor, who both received the highest prison terms of 13 years
in July, had their sentences reduced to nine and seven years
respectively, Amiri said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the eight others, the sentence for civil servant Nasser
Levihaim was reduced from 11 to seven years; Ramin Farzam, a store
clerk, 10 to eight years; shopkeeper Javid Bent-Yacoub, nine to six
years; shopkeeper Farhad Seleh, eight to six years; religion
teacher Shahrokh Paknahad, eight to five years; religion teacher
Farzad Kashi, eight to six years; Faramarz Kashi, five to three
years; and shoe clerk Ramin Nematizadeh, four to two years.
</P>
<P>
   Three other Jews were acquitted when the verdicts were handed
down July 1.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were expecting more cuts in the sentences approved by the
appeals court,'' said Jalal Soleimani, the head of Shiraz Jewish
Community. ''Still, we are hoping for greater Islamic mercy from
the authorities. We also expect the Supreme Court to restudy the
sentences approved by the appeals court in order to reduce the
latest sentences.''
</P>
<P>
   But Amiri said the court's decision could not be appealed.
</P>
<P>
   Baum said no death sentences were issued only because Iran came
under international scrutiny and pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''This trial was invalid from the very beginning,'' he said.
''The Iranians found it necessary to convict some Jews and
therefore those 10 are paying that price. We believe there was no
ground to support the convictions of any one of the 10. As long as
a single one of them remains in jail a great injustice is being
perpetrated.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Ex-Soviet States' Aid  </HEADLINE>
By PAULINE JELINEK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House on Thursday approved a new program
to shore up military forces in former Soviet states.
</P>
<P>
   The measure is part of a two-year $7.7 billion U.S. foreign aid
bill that also authorizes foreign military financing and training

in the face of Russian efforts to undermine and sabotage their
fledgling democracies,'' said Rep. Benjamin A. Gilman, R-N.Y.,
chairman of the International Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, the measure authorizes $3.8 billion for foreign
security assistance in fiscal year 2001 and $3.9 billion for 2002.

<HEADLINE> Summers, Bono Push Debt Relief  </HEADLINE>
By MARTIN CRUTSINGER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The man whose name is on a lot of dollars
teamed up with a man whose name is on a lot of records outside the
Capitol on Thursday in support of debt relief for the world's 40
poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers, whose signature appears on
American currency, and Bono, a rock star with the Irish band U2,
staged a news conference with congressional supporters of the debt
relief iniative, which both the House and the Senate have cut
signficantly back from the administration's requested $435 million.
</P>
<P>
   The black-clad Bono, wearing his signature goggle-style glasses,
joked that he would have to provide a lot more free-tickets to his
new-found friends he has picked up during the time he has spent
lobbying on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's going to be a lot of tickets. Just the sight of Orrin
Hatch in the mosh pit. ... It's exciting,'' Bono told the crowd as
the conservative Republican senator from Utah stood behind him.
</P>
<P>
   Bono has spent the last several years lobbying governments
around the world on the issue as part of a campaign being pushed by
Jubilee 2000, a coalition of religious organizations.
</P>
<P>
   The administration, as part of President Clinton's 2001 budget
request, asked Congress to provide $435 million to fund America's
share of a proposal to forgive a portion of the debt held by the
world's 40 poorest nations, most of them in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The money would be funneled through the International Monetary
Fund, the World Bank and various regional development banks.
</P>
<P>
   However, the House approved only $224 million while the Senate
approved just $75 million of the administration's request. The
issue has become entangled in a separate debate of the need to push
through reforms of the IMF and World Bank, who have come under
heavy criticism from Republicans who control both the House and
Senate for failing to properly handle the 1997-98 Asian currency
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas, chairman of the Senate Banking
Committee, has been blocking approval of separate legislation
needed to authorize IMF gold sales as part of the debt relief
iniative.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to overcome these objections, the administration
has been applying pressure to both the IMF and the World Bank to
accelerate the pace of their internal reforms.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF last Friday approved a package of measures to overhaul
its crisis lending programs. This was an area highlighted by a
congressional advisory panel chaired by Alan Meltzer, an economics
professor at Carnegie-Mellon University.
</P>
<P>
   Christi Harlan, a spokeswoman for the Banking Committee, said
that Gramm continued to have discussions with Summers over the debt
relief and reform proposals and was optimistic that the issue could
be resolved before Congress' scheduled adjournment in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the approaching congressional adjourment, the
administration was hoping to receive assurances about the money in
advance of global financial meetings that get under way on Saturday
in Prague.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of protesters have vowed to disrupt the annual
meetings of the IMF and World Bank over the coming week because of
their unhappiness with the slowness of debt relief and other IMF
and World Bank reforms.

   TOKYO (AP) -- Beer flowed and cheers went up Thursday as a ship
pulled into port carrying Japan's latest ocean catch -- 88 whales.
</P>
<P>
   The nation, which consumes whales both cooked and raw as a
delicacy, remains unabashedly defiant before growing international
criticism, defending the hunt as scientific research.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, Japan plans to catch up to 160 whales -- and much of
the meat will end up in upscale restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   ''All they think is that whales are cute,'' fisheries official
Masayuki Komatsu said derisively of Westerners at a ceremony aboard
the ship, the Nisshin Maru.
</P>
<P>
   Japan's hunt has drawn international ire. The United States
punished Japan last week by denying it some fishing rights in U.S.
waters and launched an investigation that could lead to trade
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese feel that consuming blubber is part of their
culture and are miffed about having outsiders meddle with their
eating habits.
</P>
<P>
   ''National dietary habits are products of history and should be
mutually respected,'' the Mainichi newspaper said in an editorial.
''The United States and those European states that have turned
against whaling used to slaughter whales for their oil.''
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese public has shown little interest in the whaling
controversy. TV news programs Thursday were devoted to coverage of
the Sydney Olympic Games and showed nothing on the whaling mission.
</P>
<P>
   The International Whaling Commission banned commercial whaling
in the mid-1980s but allows whaling countries to kill whales for
research to gather information on migration, eating patterns and
pollution levels.
</P>
<P>
   After pulling into a Tokyo harbor ending a monthlong mission,
the Nisshin Maru crew celebrated their return by lifting beer cans
in a joyous toast. Officials at the ceremony praised the ship's
crew and defended Japan's fight against international anti-whaling
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's no reason to criticize the mission,'' crew member
Katsuo Nemoto said. ''This is biological science.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nissin Maru and its fleet of research vessels brought back
in a refrigerated hull 88 whales caught and killed in the northwest
Pacific Ocean -- 43 Bryde's whales, five sperm whales and 40 minke
whales.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in more than a decade that the catch
included not just minke but also Bryde's and sperm whales -- two
species protected under U.S. law.
</P>
<P>
   Tokyo says both are plentiful, putting estimates at 100,000 for
sperm whales and 22,000 for Bryde's whales.
</P>
<P>
   The hunt is in no way endangering the species, fisheries
officials say, adding that the whales are hurting the livelihoods
of Japanese fishermen by eating too much fish.
</P>
<P>
   Activists say the research is no more than a guise for
satisfying Japan's taste for whale meat.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're simply trying to revive commercial whaling,'' said
Sanae Shida of Greenpeace Japan. ''Do you normally have to kill
animals to do this kind of research?''
</P>
<P>
   Kazuo Shima, an official with the government-linked Institute of
Cetacean Research, said Japan's efforts benefit the entire world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This research is not just for Japan,'' he said. ''If Japan
doesn't do this research, who will?''

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Others Guilty of War Crime  </HEADLINE>
By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- A Belgrade court found President
Clinton and other world leaders guilty of war crimes and sentenced
them -- in absentia -- to 20 years in prison for NATO's bombing
campaign against Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   The four-day trial was held in an attempt to resurrect anti-NATO
sentiment here and win votes for President Slobodan Milosevic ahead
of Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Belgrade's district court pronounced Clinton and 13 other
leaders and NATO officials ''guilty as charged'' and ordered
warrants be issued immediately for their arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Court-appointed lawyers were hired to represent the defendants.
As each 20-year sentence was read out separately, the crowd behind
a row of 14 empty chairs bearing nameplates of the accused, stood
and applauded.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused were fully conscious of their actions, they
perpetrated the socially most dangerous acts,'' presiding judge
Veroljub Raketic told some 100 spectators and media present at the
sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen, German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, French President Jacques Chirac,
as well as NATO former Secretary-general Javier Solana and retired
commander Gen. Wesley Clark, were all accused last month of war
crimes connected with the 78-day 1999 bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ''The accused had been notified and summoned to this trial
through their attorneys but they have ignored this court, either
because they were afraid of it or they were fully aware of their
guilt,'' Raketic concluded.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade judge also ordered the defendants to pay the cost
of the trial and pronounced NATO guilty of the deaths of 546
Yugoslav army soldiers, 138 Serbian policemen and 504 civilians --
88 of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia suffered heavily in the bombing, launched last year
to halt Milosevic's crackdown on ethnic Albanians in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic has campaigned on a mixture of anti-NATO slogans and
self-awarded kudos for leading the country's ''heroic
reconstruction'' after the bombing, apparently in the hope this
will translate into votes on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Belgrade prosecutor said there is no expiration date for the
crimes, and should any of the guilty parties come to Yugoslavia at
any time in the future, they would be arrested on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   The charges, listed in a 120-page indictment, included
''inciting an aggressive war and committing war crimes against a
civilian population,'' as well as use of illegal means of warfare,
attempted murder and ''violation of the territorial integrity'' of
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, footage of the NATO bombing was shown, but no
witnesses testified, since the list of plaintiffs included ''all
citizens of Yugoslavia and no courtroom was big enough to hold all
witnesses,'' Raketic said.

<HEADLINE> Speculation Around Attack in UK  </HEADLINE>
By JILL LAWLESS
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Attackers who blasted the headquarters of
Britain's intelligence service MI6 may have used a type of rocket
launcher readily available to the Irish Republican Army and the
hardline splinter groups which reject a cease-fire, police said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured and damage was minimal when the building was
struck by what police called a ''small missile'' Wednesday night.
But the attack put Londoners on guard against a renewed spate of
terrorist attacks and dealt a further blow to the security of the
secretive spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, told reporters that the missile may have
been fired by a rocket launcher from a range of 200 to 500 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Similar devices had been found in republican arms caches in
Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic and may have been used in
attacks in Britain, he said, adding that such weapons devices are
freely available from Russia and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Police are keeping an open mind, but ''clearly the sort of
weapon we believe was used in this attack is known to be in the
hands of certain groups,'' Fry said. ''They will be uppermost in
our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been no warning of the attack, which shattered a
window and two wall panels on the eighth floor, Fry said. No one
had yet claimed responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, as police began searching for evidence on the streets,
river and railway lines around the modernist building on the Thames
in central London, Fry urged vigilance against ''a genuine threat
of terrorism in London.''
</P>
<P>
   Police said attackers struck around 9:45 p.m. at the MI6
building, hitting the exterior of the eighth floor, near the top of
the building.
</P>
<P>
   They would not speculate on whether the missile had been
launched from the river or from land. Fry said the projectile did
not appear to have been a mortar shell because he would have
expected more substantial damage.
</P>
<P>
   ''I heard two large bangs,'' said Sridharan Balakrishnan, an
employee at gas station behind the MI6 building. ''It was very loud
and hurt my ears. Then I saw smoke coming from the MI6 building.''
</P>
<P>
   James Trott, who was crossing Vauxhall Bridge in a minibus when
he heard the noise, reported seeing shattered glass littering the
ground on the Thames side of the building. ''You're terrified when
that sort of thing happens because you think there might be
something else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Police sealed off roads around the area, and early train service
to and from nearby Waterloo station, including the Eurostar service
to Paris and Brussels, were also canceled Thursday, causing delays
for thousands of commuters. Rail operators said at lunchtime that
services were gradually being reinstated.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire since 1997, but dissidents
within the ranks are believed to be responsible for a number of
explosions in Northern Ireland and England in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   In July, police detonated a bomb planted on railway tracks in
west London. Government officials said they believed Irish
paramilitaries were responsible.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a small bomb exploded on London's Hammersmith Bridge,
an IRA target in past years. No one claimed responsibility but
police suspected Irish dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive cream and green MI6 headquarters was featured in
the latest James Bond movie, ''The World Is Not Enough,'' and in
one scene was shown being blown up by a terrorist bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech building bristles with security features,
including an extensive closed-circuit television system and bomb-
and bulletproof walls and windows.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year MI6, which is responsible for foreign
intelligence, was warned that its ability to gather intelligence
could be compromised by recent security lapses.
</P>
<P>
   In March, a laptop computer containing training information for
one of Britain's spy agencies was mislaid -- reportedly by an MI6
agent in a taxi -- and recovered by police two weeks later. A week
earlier, another laptop was stolen from an officer of the domestic
security service MI5 at London's Paddington station.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive espionage agency was formed in 1921, when it was
known as Military Intelligence, section six -- or MI6 for short.
</P>
<P>
   Since the end of the Cold War, MI6 has been redefining its role.
It is thought to cooperate closely with MI5 in keeping track of
Irish terror groups.

<HEADLINE> Isaac Stern Has Much To Do At 80  </HEADLINE>
By VERENA DOBNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Conductor George Szell once told Isaac Stern
that if he practiced more, he could be ''the greatest violinist in
the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Stern, who liked to do too many other things as well, has been
among the greatest. And this musical season, which begins with an
80th birthday celebration this weekend, finds him still doing
everything except practicing a lot.
</P>
<P>
   During a phone interview this month after heart surgery, Stern
chuckled over a joke about his image as a talking virtuoso:
</P>
<P>
   Two men are walking by Carnegie Hall and one says to the other,
''Have you heard Isaac Stern recently?'' The other responds: ''No --
what did he say?''
</P>
<P>
   Stern's legacy transcends music and reaches into politics and
diplomacy. Since he led a successful crusade in 1960 to save
Carnegie Hall from demolition, he has been a staunch advocate for
causes including music education in public schools, and support for
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ''The struggle to save Carnegie Hall was a watershed event in my
life,'' Stern says in his memoir, ''My First 79 Years,'' which was
written by Chaim Potok based on the musician's conversations and
notes.
</P>
<P>
   It ''taught me things about myself I hadn't known before: I
could sway influential people through speech; I had the ability to
stir crowds not only with music but also with words; I possessed an
instinctive ability to navigate with some skill the tricky waters
of politics and power.''
</P>
<P>
   The state Legislature eventually passed two bills allowing New
York City to buy Carnegie Hall for $5 million and lease it to the
Carnegie Hall Corp. The corporation voted Stern president -- he
still is -- and Carnegie's main hall was named for him in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The red-brick edifice, where Stern has played more than 150
concerts, is marking his 80th year this weekend. Stern -- whose
birthday actually was July 21 -- plans to attend a Sunday evening
gala concert. An exhibit titled ''Isaac Stern: For the Sheer Joy of
Music'' also is opening, to run through Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   On display are passports he used when he criss-crossed the world
with his violin. There are scores of violin concerti composed for
him, a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award and almost 100 honorary
degrees. A letter from Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a telegram
from Jack Benny are among fan letters on display.
</P>
<P>
   Stern's violin, a Guarnieri del Gesu, is shown only in a
photograph, since he still uses the valuable instrument.
</P>
<P>
   And he does plan to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't take my fiddle to the hospital, but I'm going to
start practicing very shortly,'' he said in the interview from his
Upper East Side apartment, five days after he was released from the
hospital. ''I will try to find which chin I'm going to put the
violin under!''
</P>
<P>
   Although musicians say Stern's playing has slipped technically
from the spectacular recordings of past years, he continues to
perform occasionally, especially chamber music with colleagues like
cellist Yo Yo Ma and pianist Emanuel Ax.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about criticism -- including Szell's comment that he
could have been greater -- Stern says: ''I'd rather be what I am.
And be as curious in as many things as I am, and as happy, rather
than playing the fiddle. It ain't the beginning and end of
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Stern talks a lot about his latest artistic
discovery: surgeon Dr. Wayne Isom, ''a true virtuoso of the
knife,'' who saved his heart and his life. Stern says it took five
operating-room sessions to give him an artificial heart valve, a
defibrillator, and some fine-tuning for ''little things that go
wrong from time to time.''
</P>
<P>
   His three-week hospital stay was ''to make certain I'll be here
in full flower when I'm 100! -- to make certain that I'll be here to
do the things I care very much about.''
</P>
<P>
   His voice was weaker than usual, but his gusto for life seemed
undiminished.
</P>
<P>
   The human heartbeat, he explained, is ''the basis for all music,
and the basis of life. ... Children instinctively understand that
pulse gives order to life.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Stern's guidance, Carnegie Hall is sponsoring music
programs in almost 100 New York City schools.
</P>
<P>
   ''From music can come order,'' he told a group of school
superintendents several months ago at Carnegie Hall, where he
picked up his violin and gave them a lesson.
</P>
<P>
   Stern has mentored generations of artists. At the Juilliard
School, students knew his support was priceless, but that he was
demanding. The lucky ones included Ma, violinists Itzhak Perlman
and Pinchas Zuckerman, and conductor Zubin Mehta.
</P>
<P>
   The tight-knit group was jokingly dubbed the ''Kosher Nostra'';
many showed support for Israel in times of crisis.
</P>
<P>
   An indelible image of Stern shows him wearing a gas mask while
Iraqi Scud missiles hit Israel during the 1991 Gulf War. He calmed
an audience by playing Bach while air-raid sirens wailed.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Kreminiecz, Poland, Stern grew up in San Francisco with
a precocious musical gift, making his New York debut at 17. Now,
his gift is to promote the music, ''the common language of
civilized life.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's what I want to do 'til the last breath that I will
draw.''

<HEADLINE> Reverse for Pentagon in Deutch Case  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Heading off a rare public dispute with the
CIA, the Pentagon changed its explanation of why it took nearly two
years to appraise damage from security lapses by former CIA
Director John Deutch.
</P>
<P>
   Until reversing its position Wednesday, the Pentagon had
explained it wasn't able to assess the damage until February
because it lacked access to the unsecured computer files where
Deutch entered defense and intelligence secrets. The Pentagon
position changed after the CIA said publicly earlier in the day
that it offered access to those files in June 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon blamed the rejection of the offer on its own
investigator.
</P>
<P>
   ''It indeed appears an offer was made by CIA investigators to a
DOD investigator in June of 1998 to examine information ... that
the CIA had gathered in its investigation of Dr. Deutch,'' a
Pentagon spokesman, Rear Adm. Craig Quigley, said. ''That offer was
declined by DOD investigators without ever informing senior
leadership within DOD of the offer.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, however, Quigley declined to say whether the
Pentagon investigator was wrong to decline the CIA's offer without
checking with higher-level officials.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to second-guess him,'' Quigley said. Later,
however, he referred to the decision as a ''problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said in an interview Wednesday that the Pentagon
investigators declined the offer in 1998 because ''in their
professional judgment, no productive purpose would be served by
starting a separate effort'' parallel to the CIA's own probe of the
Deutch matter. ''Our investigators had confidence in their
counterparts over at CIA.''
</P>
<P>
   CIA spokesman Bill Harlow said Wednesday, ''Our records show
that the CIA did offer them access on June 17, 1998, to the
journals that Deutch was working on. The journals were the parts
that would have been of interest to DOD. We did offer them access
to that at the time. They didn't pick up on it at that time.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlow added that the Pentagon had another chance to act in
August 1999 when it received a briefing on the spy agency's
findings about Deutch's handling of classified information. Defense
officials ''didn't request the underlying documents until February
2000,'' Harlow said.
</P>
<P>
   The Associated Press reported Monday that internal Defense
Department memos showed that in summer 1998 the CIA urged the
Pentagon to conduct a damage assessment. Those memos, however, did
not mention the CIA's offer to provide the Pentagon with the
computer files relevant to the military secrets.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Quigley said, ''This was all about a potential
compromise of classified information on computers that we did not
have in our possession.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's not clear to me how we would have proceeded without
reinventing a lot of the effort that CIA investigators were doing
at the very same time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said the Pentagon began its probe in February, only
after the CIA provided the materials from its investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Deutch was a former top Pentagon official before moving to the
CIA, where he was director from May 1995 to December 1996. Now a
professor at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Deutch has
apologized for his behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Quigley said he could not estimate when the Pentagon's
investigation would be completed.

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 49; Nasdaq Down 48  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday amid lingering gloom
on Wall Street about corporate profits and higher oil prices. The
uncertainty threatened to end a high-tech rally from the previous
two sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again unloaded stocks of companies that issued
warnings of disappointing profits. Even a report by one of Wall
Street's most prominent analysts that the economy remains quite
favorable for the markets failed to halt the selling.
</P>
<P>
   In midafternoon trading, the Dow moved up 48.83 to 10,736.75, a
shift away from the downward momentum of the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 48.22 to 3,849.22 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 5.82
at 1,445.82.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got some stocks that are up and pushing the Dow higher,
but in general the market remains down,'' said Barry Berman, head
trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. ''It's the end of the quarter and
right now the concerns are oil prices and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors did boost Hertz up $7.19 to $31.44 on news that
Ford was interested in buying the stock of the car rental company
that it doesn't already own.
</P>
<P>
   Most other stocks fell. With the third-quarter earnings
reporting season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that
the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks
whose companies fail to meet their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices also have investors worried. The price of a
barrel on crude on the New York Merchantile Exchange was $36.33,
down from the $37 range it reached in recent days, but still at
levels not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Tire maker Goodyear fell $2.63 to $18.38 after the company
warned that its quarterly earnings would be sluggish because of
higher oil prices and the weak euro, Europe's chief currency.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, fears of weakening in the wireless market sent
Ericsson Telephone down $1.75 to $16.25. Sprint PCS, which fell
nearly 19 percent Wednesday after it warned of below expectations
earning, continued to fall, dropping $3.06 to $29.94.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter traded down $9.81 at $86.13 after the
brokerage firm's third-quarter earnings failed to meet Wall Street
expectations.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Rep. Brown's Conduct Scrutinized  </HEADLINE>
By LARRY MARGASAK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House ethics committee said Thursday that
Rep. Corrine Brown exercised ''poor judgment'' and created
''substantial concerns'' in her connections to an African
businessman. But the panel said its inability to reach key
witnesses left it without ''sufficient evidence'' to decide whether
she violated any rules or laws.
</P>
<P>
   African businessman Foutanga Dit Babani Sissoko had provided
lodging to the Florida Democrat in his luxury Miami condominium and
his chief financial officer had given a $50,000 Lexus sedan to
Brown's daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the evidence ... raised concerns as to whether
Representative Brown may have violated standards of conduct ... the
subcommittee did not obtain sufficient evidence'' to ''adopt or to
prove a statement of alleged violation,'' said the panel, whose
official name is the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was due in large part to the fact that key witnesses who
had actual knowledge of the events within the subcommittee's
jurisdiction were beyond the reach of the committee's subpoena
power and could not be compelled to give testimony.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of proof, the subcommittee ''does believe that
Representative Brown's actions and associations in connection with
Sissoko demonstrated, at the least, poor judgment and created
substantial concerns regarding both the appearance of impropriety
and the reputation of the House of Representatives,'' the committee
said
</P>
<P>
   Brown said in a statement, ''For more than a year I have looked
forward to the day when this matter would be put to rest and I am
grateful that this day has finally come. The people of the Third
District of Florida have sent me to Washington to serve them and I
do so proudly.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown, of Jacksonville, is serving her fourth term, winning in
1998 with 55.4 percent of the vote despite the questions about her
conduct. The ethics probe was formally launched June 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Sissoko was famous for giving away cash, jewelry and expensive
cars to friends, lawyers and needy strangers. In 1997, he pleaded
guilty to paying an illegal gratuity to a U.S. Customs Service
officer to allow helicopters to be shipped to Africa. He was
sentenced to four months of house arrest and four months in prison
and required to pay a $250,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1997, Brown sought help from other members of
Congress and wrote to Attorney General Janet Reno, urging her to
release Sissoko under a law that lets nonviolent criminals be
deported before their sentence is completed. The effort failed and
Sissoko went to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Her daughter, Shantrel, accepted the car a few weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   Brown gave her side in a deposition earlier this year -- in a
lawsuit brought by a Dubai bank that accused the businessman of
stealing more than $240 million.
</P>
<P>
   The lawmaker said there was no connection between her lobbying
campaign and the Lexus. She testified she stayed in Sissoko's
luxury condominium in Miami in 1997 but reimbursed him $2,500.

<HEADLINE> Moves on 1960s Military Tests  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has agreed to search its records
for the names of ships and crew members who participated in a
series of 1960s exercises designed to test ships' ability to
withstand attack from chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon notified Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., of the
decision last week, following a request by the Department of
Veterans Affairs in August to provide information that could help
the department process claims filed by veterans who believe they
suffered health damage from their participation in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to provide the names and other information was
first reported Wednesday by CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the exercises were held has been known previously,
although originally the work was classified secret.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were among 113 conducted as part of a project called
SHAD, or Shipboard Hazard and Defense. Some apparently involved the
use of chemical and biological agents, although the Pentagon said
the two of interest to the Department of Veterans Affairs used
simulants rather than live chemical or biological agents.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Aug. 23, Army Maj. Gen. Joseph M. Cosumano
told the Department of Veterans Affairs that both simulants in
exercises ''Autumn Gold'' in 1963 and ''Copperhead'' in 1965 ''are
considered by the medical community to not pose a health risk to
man.'' He also said that all participants were briefed in advance
on the details of each exercise.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News, however, interviewed Navy veterans who said they were
given no information about the materials used in the tests. One
veteran, Robert Bates, whose ship was part of the ''Autumn Gold''
test, told CBS earlier this year, ''There were people with chemical
suits on the ship with some kind of apparatus apparently monitoring
what was going on. They wouldn't talk to you. You'd try to carry on
a conversation, try to find out what was going on, they just flat
ignored you. It always bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   The two simulants used were bacillus globigii and zinc cadmimum
sulfide, which is a florescent powder. Bacillus globigii is found
worldwide in soils and on root vegetables such as potatoes and
carrots. Los Alamos National Laboratory said last year when
preparing to use bacillus globigii in outdoor tests of detectors
for airborne biological agents that the simulant is harmless to
humans except the extremely ill.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply letter to Cosumano, Thompson thanked the Pentagon for
agreeing to search classified and unclassified documents for ship
names and logs, crew rosters, test results and medical records that
may identify service members who participated in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the Pentagon also agreed to provide a list of the
chemical, biological and other agents used in the tests and to
consider waiving secrecy agreements that test participants may have
been required to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''These steps represent a significant improvement in the way in
which our government can assist those service members who
participated in these tests and who, as a result, may be suffering
from medical problems,'' Thompson wrote.

<HEADLINE> Russia Cosmonaut Gherman Titov Dies  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Pioneering cosmonaut Gherman Titov was the first
man to spend so long orbiting the Earth that he fell asleep -- and
for the next four decades his sleep was full of dreams about
returning to space.
</P>
<P>
   The dreams ended with his death at age 65, apparently from
carbon monoxide poisoning while sitting in the sauna in his
apartment on Wednesday. Police said they were treating the death as
an accident.
</P>
<P>
   His earthbound life after the flight of Aug. 6-7, 1961, was a
success by many measures. Although Yuri Gagarin had the distinction
of being the first man in space, Titov's flight was so much longer
that it solidified the Soviet Union's lead in the space race with
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Titov was hailed as a great hero -- many liked his more modest
demeanor better than Gagarin's flamboyance -- and he later was
elected to the Russian parliament.
</P>
<P>
   But his hero status may have frustrated his most passionate
desire -- to go back into orbit. After Gagarin was killed in a 1968
plane crash, Titov was banned from further space flights,
apparently to guard against the loss of another space pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, Titov often spoke wistfully about his denied
dream.
</P>
<P>
   ''Space flight is like a drug -- once you experience it, you
can't think of anything else,'' he said in a 1996 interview with
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Titov had been widely expected to be the first to go into space,
but learned that Gagarin got the nod only three days before the
blastoff. After that, the United States sent Alan Shepard into
space -- on a suborbital flight -- and Titov had to settle for a
lesser place in the history books.
</P>
<P>
   However, his flight earned a dramatic list of superlatives: at
17 orbits, he was the first to spend more than a day in space and
the first to sleep there. At age 25, he was the youngest man in
space at that time -- a record that still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Titov was also the first to suffer ''space sickness'' --
experiencing nausea, disorientation and irregular heartbeat during
his 25 hour, 18 minute flight.
</P>
<P>
   He received the Soviet Union's highest awards, including the
Order of Hero of the Soviet Union, the Lenin Prize and the Order of
Lenin for Service to the Fatherland.
</P>
<P>
   Konstantin Kreidenko, spokesman for Russia's space agency, said
Titov's death, made public Thursday, came as a shock.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel extremely sad,'' he said. ''Aside from being a
cosmonaut, he was a great man who did a lot for the development of
space travel, not only in Russia, but internationally.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is an irretrievable loss,'' Kreidenko said.
</P>
<P>
   Back from a space shuttle mission just one day, Russian
cosmonauts Yuri Malenchenko and Boris Morukov were visibly shaken
when informed of Titov's death Thursday in Cape Canaveral, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ''We didn't hear about that,'' Malenchenko said softly, shaking
his head. ''Really bad news.''
</P>
<P>
   Titov regarded the unusual trajectory of his life with humor as
well as wistfulness, telling the ITAR-Tass news agency how his
''wholly improvised'' career developed.
</P>
<P>
   ''In childhood, I didn't dream of being a cosmonaut,'' he told
the agency during a Sept. 11 interview marking his 65th birthday.
''But one time when I was in school, a pilot came to us. I liked
his shining boots and luxurious trousers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Therefore, when the conscription call came, I answered the
question of where I wanted to serve: in aviation.''
</P>
<P>
   Titov was born Sept. 11, 1935, in the village of Verkhneye
Zhilino in the Altai Territory, close to Russia's border with
Kazakstan.
</P>
<P>
   Following his space flight, Titov became a test pilot and later
worked in a space research institute and in the Soviet Defense
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   He was elected to the lower house of the Russian parliament, the
State Duma, in 1995 as a member of the Communist Party faction. He
didn't run for a second term last year.
</P>
<P>
   Titov wrote several books devoted to space travel: ''Seventeen
Space Dawns,'' ''The Planet's First Cosmonaut,'' ''My Blue
Planet,'' and ''On the Stellar and Earth Orbits.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no information available on survivors or funeral
arrangements.

<HEADLINE> GOP Pushes on Budget Bills  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Top Republicans pushed congressional budget
writers Thursday to begin resolving spending disputes with
President Clinton. Even so, Clinton warned anew of vetoes over
environmental provisions, and GOP lawmakers added a new controversy
over dam removal in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Senate rejected a $33 billion measure financing
the Treasury Department and Congress itself -- and providing
lawmakers with a $3,800 pay raise -- House and Senate leaders
searched for ways to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility was providing extra money for the Internal
Revenue Service and counterterrorism programs that Clinton was
demanding on a separate measure financing the Interior Department,
and pushing both bills through Congress, said aides speaking on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2001, which
starts Oct. 1, have been enacted. Clinton -- along with many
lawmakers of both parties -- is demanding billions in extra spending
for schools, housing and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders were hoping a compromise Interior bill would be
ready for floor action on Friday. But the measure -- still being
crafted by House-Senate bargainers -- was short of money Clinton
wants for parkland purchases and energy conservation and had
provisions the administration opposes dealing with timber cutting
in national forests and other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've vetoed bills before because they contained them,''
Clinton warned at the White House. ''And if I have to, I'll do it
again.''
</P>
<P>
   With presidential and congressional elections less than seven
weeks away, GOP leaders were not relishing any prolonged battles
over the environment, an issue on which the public tends to favor
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Clinton spoke, House-Senate bargainers added a
provision the White House opposes to a compromise $18 billion
Interior measure. House negotiators used a 6-4 partyline vote to
accept a provision by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would block
federal agencies from removing four dams from the Snake River in
Washington state, or even studying the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has pitted fishermen and environmentalists who see dam
removal as a way to restore dwindling salmon populations against
farmers, shippers and users of hydroelectric power the dams
generate. The Clinton administration has said it is an option that
they would not even recommend for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is a politically charged one in Washington state, a
crucial state in this year's presidential race. GOP presidential
candidate George W. Bush has come out against removing the dams,
while Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
candidate, has said the question needs further study.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic bargainers viewed Gorton's amendment as an effort to
box the administration -- and by extension, Gore -- into an unpopular
position in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is not a plan that would help recover these fish. This is
a political action,'' said Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said removing the dams would be ''disastrous'' to the
region's hydroelectric industry and its users, and accused the
administration of having been ''on every side of this issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties were working to ensure
that their own constituents' needs would be met in the spending
measures.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was getting language into
the transportation spending bill that would give a high priority to
five Chicago-area mass transit projects whose federal price-tag
totals $850 million.
</P>
<P>
   And Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., was seeking language that would
provide more than $68 million to buttress ailing pension funds that
provide health care for 60,000 coal miners.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Dow Gains 25; Nasdaq Falls 69  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks were mixed Thursday amid lingering gloom
on Wall Street about corporate profits and higher oil prices. The
uncertainty threatened to end a high-tech rally from the previous
two sessions.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again unloaded stocks of companies that issued
warnings of disappointing profits. Even a report by one of Wall
Street's most prominent analysts that the economy remains quite
favorable for the markets failed to halt the selling.
</P>
<P>
   In late afternoon trading, the Dow moved up 25.16 to 10,713.08,
a shift away from the downward momentum of the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 69.42 to 3,828.02 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 9.14
at 1,442.20.
</P>
<P>
   ''You've got some stocks that are up and pushing the Dow higher,
but in general the market remains down,'' said Barry Berman, head
trader for Robert W. Baird &AMP; Co. ''It's the end of the quarter and
right now the concerns are oil prices and earnings.''
</P>
<P>
   But investors did boost Hertz up $7.31 to $31.56 on news that
Ford was interested in buying the stock of the car rental company
that it doesn't already own.
</P>
<P>
   Most other stocks fell. With the third-quarter earnings
reporting season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that
the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks
whose companies fail to meet their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices also have investors worried. The price of a
barrel on crude on the New York Merchantile Exchange was $36.33,
down from the $37 range it reached in recent days, but still at
levels not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Tire maker Goodyear fell $3.06 to $17.94 after the company
warned that its quarterly earnings would be sluggish because of
higher oil prices and the weak euro, Europe's chief currency.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, fears of weakening in the wireless market sent
Ericsson Telephone down $1.63 to $16.38. Sprint PCS, which fell
nearly 19 percent Wednesday after it warned of below expectations
earning, continued to fall, dropping $3.13 to $29.88.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter traded down $8.44 at $87.50 after the
brokerage firm's third-quarter earnings failed to meet Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market's search for sure bets meant that even companies that
beat analyst estimates were vulnerable. Investment bank Lehman
Brothers fell $4.25 to $140.19, primarily on profit-taking, a day
after its quarterly profits trounced analyst expectations by 62
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Even a report by Goldman Sachs analyst Abby Joseph Cohen stating

<HEADLINE> IRA Dissidents Suspected of Blast  </HEADLINE>
By SHAWN POGATCHNIK
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) -- The Irish Republican Army
dissidents suspected of blasting the headquarters of Britain's MI6
secret intelligence service have pursued a long IRA tradition of
striking headline-grabbing targets at crucial moments in Northern
Ireland peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
   The rocket attack late Wednesday came on the eve of an important
election testing Protestant opinion in Northern Ireland. It appears
to be the latest sign two shadowy splinter groups, the Continuity
IRA and Real IRA, are determined to resurrect the 27-year campaign
IRA commanders abandoned in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents oppose the 1998 Good Friday accord that allowed
the IRA-linked Sinn Fein party to join a new Protestant-Catholic
administration in Northern Ireland. The dissidents have resumed
high-profile attacks in London this year, placing bombs on a train
line and a bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Back home, dissident attacks simultaneously undermine Sinn Fein
and harden attitudes within the Protestant majority. Protestants
are almost evenly split over the merits of sharing power with Sinn
Fein, a key issue in Thursday's special British Parliament election
in a predominantly Protestant district of Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams led his party into
political talks three years ago, he has struggled to seek
compromise with Protestants while minimizing disillusionment and
splits in his own ranks.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1997, Adams and Sinn Fein chief negotiator Martin
McGuinness confronted their most outspoken critic, Mickey McKevitt,
who was then the IRA's ''quartermaster general'' responsible for a
network of secret arms dumps, according to Sinn Fein and other
well-placed sources.
</P>
<P>
   McKevitt rejected a process that required Sinn Fein to renounce
''armed struggle,'' to accept that Northern Ireland's political
union with Britain would remain, and to persuade IRA leaders
eventually to unveil their weapons bunkers to international
inspectors.
</P>
<P>
   McKevitt resigned to forge a group that proclaimed itself to be
the ''true IRA,'' soon christened the Real IRA by Irish media. It
built a loose alliance with another group called the Continuity
IRA.
</P>
<P>
   The first dissident car bomb ravaged a mostly Protestant village
the day after Sinn Fein entered the 1997 talks. Two more mostly
Protestant towns were hit in early 1998, apparently in hopes of
provoking the major Protestant party, the Ulster Unionists, to
demand Sinn Fein's exclusion from the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
   Phoned warnings to Belfast media, and swift police reaction,
prevented deaths.
</P>
<P>
   No group claimed responsibility, fueling Protestant suspicions
that the Adams-McGuinness leadership sanctioned the destruction,
despite their vehement denials.
</P>
<P>
   Police intercepted other car-bomb ''spectaculars'' days before
the Good Friday deal, and again on the day voters in both parts of
Ireland ratified the peace pact.
</P>
<P>
   Dissidents blasted a village the day Northern Ireland voters
elected a new legislature. Protestant hard-liners fared well,
cramping the Ulster Unionists' room for compromise.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks before President Clinton's arrival to push for
progress in 1998, dissidents bombed Omagh. Phoned warnings were
confused and imprecise, and the blast killed 29 people -- the single
worst incident in three decades of ''the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents held fire throughout 1999, as efforts to form the
power-sharing government stalled over the issue of IRA disarmament.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, the government got up and running, the IRA
unveiled a few weapons dumps to inspectors, and the dissidents
returned.
</P>
<P>
   Police say the dissidents have recruited more than 100 members --
including a few IRA men paroled from prison as part of the Good
Friday accord.
</P>
<P>
   Demonstrating a new proficiency, dissidents earlier this month
fired a mortar into a police barracks, a technology perfected by
mainstream IRA engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Recent weapons seizures in the Republic of Ireland and Croatia
indicate that dissidents have purchased weapons through Yugoslav
sources, including compact rocket launchers.
</P>
<P>
   A fragment of a rocket-propelled grenade found at the scene of
Wednesday's attack indicates such a weapon could have been used in
the strike on the MI6 headquarters.

<HEADLINE> CDC: Gonorrhea's Resistance Grows  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Gonorrhea is growing more difficult to treat,
building up resistance to two antibiotics, government researchers
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In Hawaii, strains of the sexually transmitted disease that
resist fluoroquinolone antibiotics, a common treatment, jumped from
1.4 percent in 1997 to 9.5 percent last year, the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention reported. In Kansas City, Mo.,
gonorrhea resisted a newer antibiotic, azithromycin, in 12 patients
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The government recommends three other antibiotics to treat
gonorrhea, all of them more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   Drug-resistant strains of gonorrhea have spread from Asia and
similar resistance in the mainland United States is inevitable,
said Susan Wang, a CDC epidemiologist. Similar resistance in the
1980s rendered penicillin and tetracycline ineffective for treating
gonorrhea.
</P>
<P>
   The disease causes painful, burning urination and a puslike
discharge from the urethra or vagina. The government documented
360,000 cases in the United States in 1999.

<HEADLINE> Country Ends Nameless Bank Accounts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VADUZ, Liechtenstein (AP) -- Liechtenstein's bankers said
Thursday they have formally approved the abolition of anonymous
accounts, fulfilling a commitment they made two months ago under
pressure to clamp down on money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which goes into effect Oct. 1, was made at a
special general meeting of the Liechtenstein Bankers Association,
which stressed that bank customer secrecy is otherwise intact.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next month, banks will require lawyers and other
intermediaries to disclose the names of the depositors they
represent. The banks then will check out the identities themselves.
</P>
<P>
   They also will check the identities of existing anonymous
account holders. ''The banks hope to complete the work by the end
of 2001 at the latest,'' their association said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The Alpine principality of 32,000 people has been in the
international spotlight over the past year following the
publication of allegations that it is a favored location for
organized criminals and drug traffickers to launder money.
</P>
<P>
   In June, it was placed on a blacklist of nations accused of
failing to cooperate in the fight against the concealment of
illegally earned funds. The government has pushed through a package
of measures to tighten the law.
</P>
<P>
   ''With the new policy, the bankers association is acting
decisively to counter the criticism against Liechtenstein with
concrete measures,'' the bankers' association said. Sanctions for
failing to comply would include exclusion from the group.
</P>
<P>
   The bankers have said that some clients, such as foundations,
may refuse to disclose their identity and decide to withdraw their
funds.
</P>
<P>
   The ''Know Your Customer'' requirement has been applied in
neighboring Switzerland over the past decade to halt foreign
potentates and criminals from using so-called numbered accounts to
hide ill-gotten gains.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated one-third of Liechtenstein bank deposits are placed
by intermediaries.

<HEADLINE> UN Aid Workers March For Protection  </HEADLINE>
By NAOMI KOPPEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA (AP) -- About 1,500 aid workers -- some wearing white arm
bands and carrying photographs of slain and abducted U.N.
colleagues -- marched Thursday to demand more protection while
working in some of the world's most dangerous places.
</P>
<P>
   ''Refugees' lives depend on us, but they can depend on us only
if we stay alive,'' Sadako Ogata, the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, told the Geneva rally to protest the killing of four
UNHCR workers killed this month -- three in West Timor and one in
Guinea -- and the abduction of a fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Why should innocent humanitarian workers be again the target
of merciless aggressors?'' Ogata asked the rally of 1,500 aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Around the globe, UNHCR and other U.N. workers took part in
memorial services, rallies and marches to remember their colleagues
and insist that such attacks should never be allowed to happen
again.
</P>
<P>
   Workers from the UNHCR head office in Geneva wore white armbands
in solidarity at a memorial service for the latest victim, Mensah
Kpognon, who was killed in Guinea on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The workers then filed out to join staff from the Red Cross, the
International Organization for Migration and the aid agency Doctors
Without Borders, on the march.
</P>
<P>
   At a ceremony attended by 500 people in Nairobi, Kenya, Klaus
Toepfer, head of the U.N. office, called on governments everywhere
''to improve security measures that will ensure the safety of
all.''
</P>
<P>
   In Dili, capital of East Timor, around 150 demonstrators carried
banners that read: ''No aid without security'' and ''Enough is
enough.'' Operations have been suspended in West Timor since the
killings at the UNHCR office in Atambua, West Timor.
</P>
<P>
   ''We need to be stronger facing atrocities,'' Bernard Kouchner,
the top U.N. official in Kosovo, told several hundred people in
Pristina, the capital of the province.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, the U.N. flag was lowered to half mast and U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan led some 1,200 marchers in a minute of
silence in memory of the victims, whom he called ''heroes who
worked to save lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 workers have been killed in the field over the last 10
years, 35 over the last year alone, said U.N. Staff Union President
Mary Madarshahi, who blamed the deaths on a lack of respect for
U.N. workers. ''We have been silent for a decade and now U.N. staff
have become moving targets without any support and without
protection.''
</P>
<P>
   Mary Robinson, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights told The
Associated Press in Geneva:
</P>
<P>
   ''Think of the parents of idealistic men and women of so many
different nationalities who are so proud that their son or daughter
is out there ... working for the most vulnerable sectors, refugees
who are desperate.
</P>
<P>
   ''And what happens? They are murdered in atrocious
circumstances.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrators maintain that unarmed humanitarian workers
often are asked to go to places where governments are unwilling
even to send peacekeeping troops.
</P>
<P>
   Kpognon was the 15th U.N. civilian to die this year, and the
198th since January 1992. The majority were killed in shootings,
bombings or ethnic violence.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to live and not to be killed. We are aid workers, not
martyrs,'' Naveed Hussain, head of the UNHCR staff association,
told the Geneva rally.
</P>
<P>
   In a message, Annan backed the workers' demands.
</P>
<P>
   ''Words fail us at a time like this. They fail to express our
outrage at the senseless violence against a humanitarian worker
whose sole purpose was to help people in need,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''But words must not fail us in the message we send today to the
world and to member states of the United Nations. This message must
be clear and unequivocal -- failure to protect the lives of innocent
and unarmed humanitarian workers is unacceptable.''

<HEADLINE> CDC: Racial Gap of Premies Narrows  </HEADLINE>
By ERIN McCLAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Black babies are twice as likely as white infants
to be born prematurely, but the gap is narrowing, the government
reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Single-born premature births among black women fell nearly 10
percent between 1990 and 1997, while the figure for white women
increased 11 percent, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention said.
</P>
<P>
   Government health officials called the narrowing racial gap
encouraging but said they would wait for more research before
trying to pinpoint reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ''For a long time we didn't have any movement,'' said Dr. Willie
Parker of the California Department of Health. ''This shows the gap
that exists between black and white women is not a fixed one. We
need to look at what the success strategies have been.''
</P>
<P>
   The premature birth rate among black women fell 9.8 percent,
from 178.5 per 1,000 live births in 1990 to 160.9 in 1997. Among
white women, the rate rose 11 percent, from 75.4 per 1,000 in 1990
to 83.7 in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   West Virginia had the highest premature birth rate among white
women in 1997. Vermont had the lowest. The District of Columbia had
the highest rate among black women, Minnesota the lowest.
</P>
<P>
   The government hopes to eliminate the disparity in premature
births among racial and ethnic groups by 2010.
</P>
<P>
   The CDC compiled data from all 50 states and the District of

<HEADLINE> Gov't Report: Racism Still in U.S.  </HEADLINE>
By SONYA ROSS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The laws of the United States meet the
requirements of an international treaty on eliminating racism, but
American society has not achieved that goal, a federal report
released Thursday concludes.
</P>
<P>
   In its first analysis of U.S. compliance with the United Nations
Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial
Discrimination, the U.S. government admitted that racism remains a
stubborn problem.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers cited recent incidents as reminders of the need to
eliminate racism: the 1991 police beating of black motorist Rodney
King; the shooting death of African immigrant Amadou Diallo by
police in New York; the burning of synagogues, mosques and black
churches; the dragging death of James Byrd Jr. in Texas; the
shootings at a Jewish cultural center in Los Angeles; and the
discriminatory practices revealed in lawsuits against Denny's
restaurants and the Adams Mark hotel chain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have not yet met the challenge of creating a colorblind
society,'' said Harold Hongju Koh, assistant secretary of state for
democracy, human rights and labor.
</P>
<P>
   ''While officially sanctioned segregation has been eliminated,
de facto segregation and persistent racial discrimination continue
in parts of our society.''
</P>
<P>
   A shift in the racial and ethnic composition of the country also
is an exacerbating factor, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   While whites are a majority of Americans -- 196.1 million -- they
are a shrinking percentage of the population, falling from 75.7
percent in 1991 to 71.9 percent today.
</P>
<P>
   During the same period, the country's Asian population increased
by 46 percent, to 10.9 million; the Hispanic population increased
by 40 percent, to 31.4 million; American Indians increased by 16
percent to 2.4 million and the number of blacks rose by 14 percent,
to 34.9 million.
</P>
<P>
   ''The true extent of contemporary racism remains clouded by
ignorance as well as differences of perception,'' the report said.
''While most whites do not believe there is much discrimination
today in American society, most minorities see the opposite in
their life experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   In a separate report, civil rights and social advocacy groups
said the United States is out of compliance with the U.N. treaty in
certain areas, such as affirmative action, racial profiling by
police and administration of the death penalty. They urged the
United Nations to consider American-style racism a human rights
problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been increasing demands, especially by developing
countries, that while the U.S. must continue to focus attention on
human rights violations abroad, we need to do more to recognize and
address situations of human rights non-compliance in our own
country,'' said the report, compiled by the World Organization
Against Torture USA.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department report stopped short of declaring racism in
America a human rights concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''No country or society is completely free of racism,
discrimination or ethnocentrism,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The report to the United Nations was compiled by the State
Department, with assistance from other federal agencies, for a U.N.
conference next year in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think that we look forward to the world conferences on
racism because we think ... we've learned some lessons of how to
deal with realities of life in a multiracial, multi-ethnic
setting,'' said Bill Lann Lee, assistant attorney general for civil
rights.
</P>
<P>
   The United States ratified the discrimination treaty in October
1994, and was originally to have delivered Thursday's report in
1995.
</P>
<P>
   The report did not address the delay, but said the federal
government had been engaged in a major review of racial issues
since June 1997, when President Clinton launched his national
dialogue on race. Clinton promised to write his own report on
racial issues two years ago, but it has not materialized.
</P>
<P>
   State Department researchers said racist practices today are
''more subtle and elusive'' than those at the height of the civil
rights movement, and threaten to undermine the ''significant
progress'' made since the 1960s.

<HEADLINE> Case Information of 10 Iranian Jews  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   An Iranian appeals court on Thursday reduced the
sentences of
the following 10 Iranian Jews, who had been convicted of spying for
Israel. Defense lawyers said the prosecution's case had relied
solely on confessions made after long periods of detention.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Dani Tefilin, 30: Sentence reduced to nine years. Identified as
the main defendant, he was originally sentenced to 13 years for
membership in an illegal group and cooperation with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Tefilin, a shoe salesman, was the first of the defendants to be
arrested more than a year ago and the first to confess on
television. He said he had traveled to Israel and trained with its
main external spy agency, Mossad. He said Israel had paid him in
installments of $500 in exchange for sensitive information about
Iran, and that his mother, two sisters and a brother live in the
Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Asher Zadmehr, 54: Sentence reduced to seven years. An
English-language professor, he originally received a 13-year jail
sentence for setting up an illegal spy network and cooperating with
Israel. Zadmehr confessed to having cooperated with Israel and
having assessed and evaluated information before it was sent to the
Jewish state, but he denied forming a spy ring.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Nasser Levihaim, 50: Sentence reduced to seven years. A civil
servant who worked for the state power company, Levihaim originally
was given an 11-year jail term for his admitted leadership role in
the network. Levihaim said his role was to cull the information
gathered by other agents. Levihaim said he was motivated by
ideological reasons and love of the Jewish state, not by money.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Ramin Farzam, 27: Sentence reduced to eight years. A store
clerk, he was originally sentenced to 10 years for membership in an
illegal group and cooperation with Israel. Farzam pleaded guilty to
espionage charges, saying he was paid by Israel to spy but was
caught before he could relay information.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Shahrokh Paknahad, 30: Sentence reduced to five years. A
religion teacher, he was originally sentenced to eight years. He
confessed to spying for Israel. A stalwart of the small Jewish
community in Shiraz, he said he had used his position to recruit
agents. Paknahad said he collected information for sabotage and
gathered military information during the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war
while he was performing mandatory military service.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Javid Bent-Yacoub, 42: Sentence reduced to six years. A
shopkeeper, he originally received nine years for membership in an
illegal group, cooperation with Israel and recruitment of new
agents. He said he had traveled to Israel for 45 days in 1993,
where he had met with a Mossad agent.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Farhad Seleh, 40: Sentence reduced to six years. An owner of a
textile shop and a religion teacher, he was sentenced to eight
years for membership in an illegal group and cooperation with
Israel. He pleaded guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Farzad Kashi, 30: Sentence reduced to six years. A religion
teacher, he originally was sentenced to eight years for membership
in an illegal group and cooperation with Israel. Kashi pleaded not
guilty.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Faramarz Kashi, 34: Sentence reduced to three years. A religion
teacher and brother of Farzad, he confessed to spying for Israel
and originally was given a five-year sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ------
</P>
<P>
   Ramin Nematizadeh, 27: Sentence reduced to two years. A shop
clerk, he was originally sentenced to four years. He confessed in

<HEADLINE> Spanish Councilor Shot Dead  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANT ADRIA DE BESOS, Spain (AP) -- A town councilor of the ruling
Popular Party was shot to death outside Barcelona on Thursday,
bringing to 13 the number of killings blamed on the armed Basque
separatist group ETA so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Luis Ruiz Casado, 42, was shot once behind the left ear as
he walked to his car in the coastal town of Sant Adria de Besos on
the outskirts of Barcelona, said police. He was shot again in the
head after he fell to the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   According to witnesses, two attackers fled the scene in a white
Renault, which was later found nearby, torched to destroy evidence,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The assassination came soon after French and Spanish police
detained 29 suspected ETA members over the weekend, including
Ignacio Gracia Arregui, considered the leader of ETA's military
wing.
</P>
<P>
   A French court put 10 of those suspects -- six Spanish and four
French -- under formal investigation Thursday, judicial sources
said.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish Interior Minister Jaime Mayor Oreja said Sunday the
police roundup had caused ''almost irreparable damage'' to ETA
because some of the suspects played key roles in the group's
forgery and logistical operations. But he warned that ETA would
probably seek revenge.
</P>
<P>
   After a particularly bloody summer, Ruiz Casado's death is the
13th this year blamed on ETA, which ended a 14-month cease-fire
last December. The separatist group has claimed 11 of the killings.
It usually claims its attacks several weeks later.
</P>
<P>
   The escalation of violence could be an attempt by ETA to force
the government into negotiations. One round of talks held during
the cease-fire produced no advances. But the government has since
ruled out talks and insists on combatting ETA with police measures.
</P>
<P>
   Ruiz Casado, married with two children, was the fourth town
councilor of Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's center-right Popular
Party killed so far this year. The other victims included
opposition Socialist party and security force members.
</P>
<P>
   Aznar, who visited Ruiz Casado's widow in Barcelona, called on
Spaniards to ''maintain a tenacious and daily effort and permanent
mobilization'' against ETA.
</P>
<P>
   King Juan Carlos denounced ''ETA's blind terrorism.'' Deputies
in the European Parliament in Strasbourg, who were discussing ETA
violence as news of the shooting came in, held a minute of silence.
</P>
<P>
   The regional government declared two days of mourning and the
balconies and windows of Sant Adria de Besos fluttered with white
sheets marked with black ribbons as stunned friends and relatives
gathered at the crime scene.
</P>
<P>
   ETA has claimed the killing of nearly 800 people in its 32-year
campaign for a Basque homeland straddling northern Spain and
southwestern France. Its name is an acronym for Basque Homeland and
Freedom in the Basque language.
</P>
<P>
   An anti-ETA protest has been called in Barcelona for Friday
evening. Tens of thousands of people had already been expected to
march in an anti-ETA rally Saturday to protest the recent
escalation of violence.

<HEADLINE> Gunmen Holding Hostages in Russia  </HEADLINE>
By JUDITH INGRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian security forces surrounded a hotel in
southern Russia on Thursday where gunmen held at least four people
hostage and were demanding $30 million and a helicopter.
</P>
<P>
   Police held off storming the building as they negotiated with
the hostage-takers by mobile phone.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen appeared to have dropped a demand that Russia release
all Chechens being held in prison, and a top government spokesman
said it wasn't clear whether the incident had anything to do with
Russia's war against separatists in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Security agents occupied the first floor of the two-story
building in the southern Russian town of Lazarevskoye, 35 miles
west of the Black Sea resort of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
   But Gherman Ugryumov, a deputy director of the Federal Security
Service, said agents would not storm the building unless they saw
an immediate threat to the hostages' lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the situation changes and the lives of the hostages are
threatened, law enforcement agencies will use force,'' he said.
''Negotiations are going on constantly.''
</P>
<P>
   There were conflicting reports of how many people were involved
in the hostage-taking.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin's envoy to the region, Viktor
Kazantsev, said there were four gunmen and six hostages, while Maj.
Salbi Gerba, the head of the local Interior Ministry branch said a
man who fled the scene said four people were being held by two
gunmen.
</P>
<P>
   Sergei Yastrzhembsky, a Kremlin spokesman, said five people were
being held in a private house that was being used as a small hotel,
and that there were three captors. At least one person escaped by
jumping out a window, Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunmen did not identify themselves, officials said. But
Yastrzhembsky said they were local residents and they were
demanding talks with Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Russian television networks showed police in bulletproof vests
surrounding the three-story house, and armored vehicles parked
outside it. Crowds of onlookers stood on nearby street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Initial negotiations were conducted through a female hostage,
officials said, but officials later passed a mobile telephone to
the gunmen and opened direct negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   The hostage-taking came several days before the anniversary of
the start of the latest Russian war in Chechnya. Russian jets
bombed the outskirts of Grozny on Sept. 23, 1999, and troops rolled
into the breakaway republic seven days later.
</P>
<P>
   But Yastrzhembsky said it was too early to draw a connection.
''There are no grounds so far to speak of a Chechen connection,
since the terrorists have not been identified yet,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 78; Nasdaq Falls 68  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed Thursday amid lingering
gloom on Wall Street about corporate profits and higher oil prices.
The uncertainty ended a two-day rally in the high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again unloaded stocks of companies that issued
warnings of disappointing profits. Technology and brokerage firms
were among the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 77.60 to 10,765.52,
according the preliminary calculations. The buying represented a
shift away from the downward momentum of the past few sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index
fell 68.49 to 3,828.95 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 5.55
at 1,445.79.
</P>
<P>
   Even a report by one of Wall Street's most prominent analysts
that the economy remains quite favorable for the markets failed to
halt the selling.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the end of the quarter and right now the concerns are oil
prices and earnings,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W.
Baird &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   But investors did boost Hertz up $7.38 to $31.63 on news that
Ford wants to purchase all of the car rental company's remaining
stock that Ford doesn't already own.
</P>
<P>
   Most other stocks fell. With the third-quarter earnings
reporting season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that
the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks
whose companies fail to meet their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices also have investors worried. The price of a
barrel on crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $36.33,
down from the $37 range it reached in recent days, but still at
levels not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Tire maker Goodyear fell $2.88 to $18.13 after the company
warned that its quarterly earnings would be sluggish because of
higher oil prices and the weak euro, Europe's chief currency.
</P>
<P>
   On the Nasdaq, fears of weakening in the wireless market sent
Ericsson Telephone down $1.58 to $16.42. Sprint PCS, which fell
nearly 19 percent Wednesday after it warned of below expectations
earning, continued to fall, dropping $3.25 to $29.75.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter traded down $6.19 at $89.75 after the
brokerage firm's third-quarter earnings failed to meet Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market's search for sure bets meant that even companies that
beat analyst estimates were vulnerable. Investment bank Lehman
Brothers fell $2.94 to $141.50, primarily on profit-taking, a day
after its quarterly profits trounced analyst expectations by 62
cents.
</P>
<P>
   Even a report by Goldman Sachs analyst Abby Joseph Cohen stating
that high oil prices, the weak euro and corporate profit concerns
will be short-lived failed to calm inevstors. She also reiterated
that U.S. economic conditions remain quite favorable, particularly
in the areas of improved productivity and government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 8-to-5 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 1.08 billion shares,
down from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 5.69 at 515.74.

<HEADLINE> Pentagon Seeks Chemical Test Vets  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon has agreed to search its records
for the names of ships and crew members who participated in a
series of 1960s exercises designed to test ships' ability to
withstand attack from chemical and biological weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon notified Rep. Mike Thompson, D-Calif., of the
decision last week, following a request by the Department of
Veterans Affairs in August to provide information that could help
the department process claims filed by veterans who believe they
suffered health damage from their participation in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to provide the names and other information was
first reported Wednesday by CBS News.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that the exercises were held has been known previously,
although originally the work was classified secret.
</P>
<P>
   The tests were among 113 conducted as part of a project called
SHAD, or Shipboard Hazard and Defense. Some apparently involved the
use of chemical and biological agents, although the Pentagon said
the two of interest to the Department of Veterans Affairs used
simulants rather than live chemical or biological agents.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter dated Aug. 23, Army Maj. Gen. Joseph M. Cosumano
told the Department of Veterans Affairs that both simulants in
exercises ''Autumn Gold'' in 1963 and ''Copperhead'' in 1965 ''are
considered by the medical community to not pose a health risk to
man.'' He also said that all participants were briefed in advance
on the details of each exercise.
</P>
<P>
   CBS News, however, interviewed Navy veterans who said they were
given no information about the materials used in the tests. One
veteran, Robert Bates, whose ship was part of the ''Autumn Gold''
test, told CBS earlier this year, ''There were people with chemical
suits on the ship with some kind of apparatus apparently monitoring
what was going on. They wouldn't talk to you. You'd try to carry on
a conversation, try to find out what was going on, they just flat
ignored you. It always bothered me.''
</P>
<P>
   The two simulants used were bacillus globigii and zinc cadmimum
sulfide, which is a florescent powder. Bacillus globigii is found
worldwide in soils and on root vegetables such as potatoes and
carrots. Los Alamos National Laboratory said last year when
preparing to use bacillus globigii in outdoor tests of detectors
for airborne biological agents that the simulant is harmless to
humans except the extremely ill.
</P>
<P>
   In a reply letter to Cosumano, Thompson thanked the Pentagon for
agreeing to search classified and unclassified documents for ship
names and logs, crew rosters, test results and medical records that
may identify service members who participated in the tests.
</P>
<P>
   Thompson said the Pentagon also agreed to provide a list of the
chemical, biological and other agents used in the tests and to
consider waiving secrecy agreements that test participants may have
been required to sign.
</P>
<P>
   ''These steps represent a significant improvement in the way in
which our government can assist those service members who
participated in these tests and who, as a result, may be suffering
from medical problems,'' Thompson wrote.

<HEADLINE> Antipoverty Bill Loaded With Pork  </HEADLINE>
By CURT ANDERSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A deal between President Clinton and the
Republican House speaker to use tax breaks and federal seed money
for reviving inner-city slums and pockets of rural poverty swelled
by $9 billion in only two days as senators from both parties sought
to tack on dozens of election-year pet projects.
</P>
<P>
   From molasses tariffs to protect Louisiana sugar growers to tax
credits East Coast senators want for Amtrak, lawmakers are
clamoring this week to attach at least 73 amendments to a
''community renewal'' bill put together by Clinton and Speaker
Dennis Hastert, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has become a vehicle everyone knows is going to get signed
into law,'' said Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, chairman of the House
Ways and Means Committee. ''It's going to have a deluge of
amendments in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   The estimated 10-year cost of the bill had swelled from $17
billion when it passed the House this summer to $28.7 billion by
Tuesday, when Senate Finance Committee Chairman William Roth,
R-Del., released a version with new tax credits for Amtrak and
companies providing high-speed Internet access in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   By Thursday, Roth was ready to propose a measure costing about
$37 billion with others sought by individual senators. But a
Finance Committee session Thursday to vote on it was canceled
because of fights over how the pie is to be divided, leaving the
entire effort in limbo.
</P>
<P>
   ''We want to finalize it before the end of the year,'' said
Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. ''But we all have to
give and take to reach this goal.''
</P>
<P>
   The House-passed bill includes a package of provisions to spur
capital investment in low-income areas:
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton's ''New Markets'' initiative creating 10 venture
capital firms to invest in small businesses in poor neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   --An expansion of ''empowerment zones'' where tax breaks and
regulatory relief apply.
</P>
<P>
   --An increase in the low-income housing credit.
</P>
<P>
   --An expansion of tax breaks for reclamation of ''brownfield''
industrial sites.
</P>
<P>
   --Tax credits for renovating historic buildings.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for the logjam, senators and their aides say, is
frustration from both Democrats and Republicans who face a
dwindling number of legislative days in this Congress and few ways
of getting their priority projects through the process.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, said he persuaded
Roth to include a number of farm-related tax items in the bill,
some of them vetoed by Clinton earlier this year as part of a bill
that would have repealed federal inheritance taxes.
</P>
<P>
   These include tax-deductible savings accounts for up to 20
percent of a farmer's income, expanding bonds for state-sponsored
loans to beginning farmers and modifying a tax credit for biomass
energy to include wood chips and untreated construction debris.
</P>
<P>
   ''Biomass facilities are making a valuable contribution to a
cleaner environment, but we have left them in a financially
precarious position without favorable tax treatment,'' Grassley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Some senators wanted one more crack at getting Clinton to sign
Republican tax bills he has already vetoed this year, including the
estate repeal and marriage penalty tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Others proposed expanding spending programs. For example,
Grassley and Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., want to permit
low-income families to keep severely disabled children on Medicaid
even if their earnings rise above the program's limits.
</P>
<P>
   One key disagreement involved Roth, who is in a tough
re-election fight against Delaware Gov. Tom Carper. His proposed
new Amtrak tax credits -- important to Northeast states like
Delaware -- are vehemently opposed by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., who
says the railroad would be ''double-dipping'' into the U.S.
Treasury because they already are getting transportation trust fund
money.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Senate package sinks under the sheer weight of
amendments, sponsors expressed optimism that some version will
eventually find its way to Clinton's desk this year. One avenue
open to GOP leaders is attaching it to a must-pass spending bill,
particularly if Democrats persist in blocking tax bills on the
Senate floor.
</P>
<P>
   ''In this process, you just have to be patient. It can be very
frustrating,'' said Rep. J.C. Watts, R-Okla., one of the key
authors of the House bill.

<HEADLINE> Justice: Toss Va. Census Sample  </HEADLINE>
By GENARO C. ARMAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department asked a federal court
Thursday to dismiss a case involving a Virginia statute barring the
use of sampled census data when the state redraws its political
districts.
</P>
<P>
   The case is the first of what are expected to be numerous legal
challenges associated with the Census Bureau's scheduled release of
a population count adjusted by the statistical method known as
''sampling.'' It is being watched closely by other states with
similar laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Virginia Legislature passed the law this year requiring the
use of nonsampled data for redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau plans to issue both a traditional head count and a
second set of numbers adjusted by sampling, which statisticians
believe will be more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a history of racial discrimination, Virginia is one
of 16 states under the federal Voting Rights Act that must seek
federal approval before enforcing changes in laws such as those
governing legislative redistricting.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the state asked U.S. District Court for the District
of Columbia to rule their law requiring use of nonsampled data was
acceptable and should not be subject to Justice approval.
</P>
<P>
   During the hour-long hearing Thursday before a three-judge
panel, Justice attorney Steven Pershing argued that ''ultimately,
the issue in this case can't be decided ... before Census numbers
are released ... There is no harm to wait until Census numbers come
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Every 10 years, states must redraw congressional and legislative
districts to reflect population shifts. Each district must be as
equal in population as possible to meet the Supreme Court's
one-person, one-vote mandate.
</P>
<P>
   The Census Bureau must release the actual head count for all 50
states by Dec. 31. However, that release will not break down
population counts for more specific geographic areas such as
counties and municipalities -- information essential for states to
redistrict.
</P>
<P>
   The local data must be released by April 1 -- the same day that
sampled data, if approved by the Census Bureau, must be released.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia Deputy Attorney General Frank Ferguson said that
timeline did not give the state enough leeway to draw up new
political boundaries. Virginia is one of a few states, including
New Jersey, that have major off-year elections.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia law currently allows for the June 2001 primaries to be
pushed back as late as September of that year.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a very real possibility that we could not hold
(general) elections by November of 2001,'' Ferguson said.
''Legislators just can't come into town and draw those
(redistricting) plans overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The judges gave no timetable for a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters of sampling say it helps account for those missed,
including minorities, the poor, and inner-city residents -- segments
of the population that tend to vote Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans, in general, say the Census Bureau's sampling plan
is flawed. Some GOP leaders fear that using sampled data could lead
to new political districts with higher concentrations of Democratic
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen cities and counties from around the country have also
entered the case against Virginia, arguing the plan would be
harmful to urban areas that need sampling to fully account for
their population and share of federal dollars. They include Los
Angeles; Richmond, Va.; Houston; Denver; Inglewood, Calif.;
Oakland; San Francisco; San Antonio; Dearborn, Mich.; and Dade
County, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   In a separate case, the Supreme Court last year said that the
reapportionment of the 435 House seats among the states must be
based solely on nonsampled data. It left open to states the option
of using either set of numbers for redistricting, heightening the
importance of statehouse elections in the years to come.

<HEADLINE> Te Kanawa Enlivens NY Philharmonic  </HEADLINE>
By MARY CAMPBELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Kiri Te Kanawa sang with the New York
Philharmonic for the first time in 14 years, delivering a haunting
performance of Richard Strauss music that livened up the audience
after a lackluster first half of the orchestra's seasonal opening
night Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   After intermission, the 56-year-old soprano sang the final scene
from ''Arabella'' in a nostalgic tone, tinged with regret. Her
encore song, ''Morgen,'' was the most memorable of the four
selections she sang -- melancholy and quietly delicate.
</P>
<P>
   The Philharmonic proved what a great orchestra it is with ''Till
Eulenspiegel.'' A listener could follow the merry pranks of Till
because the orchestra, conducted by music director Kurt Masur,
always kept the aural focus on the instrument depicting the joke of
the moment. ''Till Eulenspiegel'' will be played again on the last
week of the season, which ends June 9.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the program lacked excitement and sizzle, and
didn't excite more than polite applause from the audience.
</P>
<P>
   The evening at Avery Fisher Hall at Lincoln Center began like a
Mostly Mozart program, with the overture to ''The Magic Flute'' and
two Mozart arias. The pianissimo of Te Kanawa's lyric soprano was a
quiet delight, but not invigorating. One aria was Pamina's lament
from ''The Magic Flute'' and the other, livelier but still
performed delicately was from ''The Good-Hearted Grump.''
</P>
<P>
   The first act ended with Mendelssohn's ''Symphony No. 4,'' an
optimistic work known as the ''Italian Symphony.'' Masur conducted
with relish and affection.
</P>
<P>
   The next three weeks of Philharmonic concerts are a Mendelssohn
festival, and the fourth week's mixed program includes
Mendelssohn's ''Piano Concerto in G minor.''
</P>
<P>
   The concert was broadcast on PBS as a ''Live from Lincoln
Center'' presentation. Proceeds went to the Philharmonic's pension
fund.

<HEADLINE> Army: Chemical Weapons Plant Fixed  </HEADLINE>
By MATT KELLEY
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The safety lapses that let a tiny amount of
the nerve gas sarin escape from the Army's chemical weapons
incinerator in Utah have been fixed, officials told a House panel
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The corrective actions we've taken ... will most likely
prevent this type of thing from happening again,'' said Mike Rowe,
manager of the incinerator near Tooele, Utah.
</P>
<P>
   A similar accident would not result in any nerve gas releases at
incinerators being built in Alabama, Oregon and Arkansas, because
those facilities have extra filters and other safety features, Army
officials told the House Armed Services subcommittee on military
procurement.
</P>
<P>
   A jammed incinerator door started a series of equipment problems
and worker errors leading to the sarin leak May 8-9. The leak was
the first reported at the Utah incinerator, which has burned
thousands of tons of nerve gas and other chemical weapons since
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Rowe said the amount of sarin released was smaller than a drop
of water, and investigations by the Army and the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention concluded that the release was too
tiny to harm people or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Sarin, the same chemical used in a Tokyo subway attack in 1995
that killed 12, kills by paralyzing the lungs and other vital
organs.
</P>
<P>
   Republican Rep. Bob Riley and Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama said
the Utah accident lowered their confidence in a similar chemical
weapons incinerator being built near Anniston, Ala. Riley said he
was upset that Army officials had assured him before the accident
that nerve gas could never escape the Utah incinerator.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Army has lost a lot of credibility in my eyes,'' Riley
said.
</P>
<P>
   Army officials and outside scientists told the lawmakers that
destroying the chemical weapons is safer than letting them
deteriorate in storage. Many of those weapons leak, which
occasionally releases nerve gas, mustard gas or blistering agents
into the air, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The greatest risk is from the leaks'' from stored weapons,
said John Ferriter, a top official in the Army's chemical weapons
destruction program.
</P>
<P>
   Such leaks have released one million times the nerve gas
released by the Utah accident, said David Kosson, a member of a
National Academy of Sciences group that oversees chemical weapons
destruction.

<HEADLINE> Brit Cops Find Grenade Launcher  </HEADLINE>
By SUE LEEMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Police on Thursday found part of a
rocket-propelled grenade launcher near the scene of an attack on
the headquarters of Britain's MI6 intelligence service, which they
believe may have been the work of IRA dissidents.
</P>
<P>
   No one was injured in the Wednesday night attack and damage was
limited to one window and two wall panels on the eighth floor. But
it raised fears of a renewed spate of terrorist attacks in London
and dealt another blow to the security of the secretive spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   The grenade launcher was found in a nearby park on Thursday
afternoon, but police did not yet know whether it had been fired
from the same spot. Tests were being carried out to determine its
make.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, police had said the attackers may have used a type of
rocket launcher readily available to the Irish Republican Army and
the hardline splinter groups which reject a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   Deputy Assistant Commissioner Alan Fry, head of Scotland Yard's
anti-terrorist branch, told reporters that the missile may have
been fired from a range of 200 to 500 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Similar devices had been found in republican arms caches and may
have been used in attacks in Britain, he said, adding that the
weapons are freely available from arms traders operating in Russia
and the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Fry said police are keeping an open mind, but ''clearly the sort
of weapon we believe was used in this attack is known to be in the
hands of certain groups. They will be uppermost in our minds.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack, which came
without warning.
</P>
<P>
   The IRA has observed a cease-fire since 1997. Defectors are
believed to be responsible for recent explosions in Northern
Ireland and England, including a small bomb that exploded on
London's Hammersmith Bridge in June and a bomb planted on railway
tracks in west London in July and later detonated by police.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on the high-tech headquarters, which bristles with
extensive closed-circuit television system and bomb- and
bulletproof walls and windows, was the latest security problem for
the intelligence agency.
</P>
<P>
   Historian Donald Cameron Watt, a former intelligence agent, said
an attack had been on the cards since MI6 moved into its
high-profile headquarters from several locations around the city in
1994.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people, myself included, thought it was stupid,''
Watt said. ''I thought that secret services were supposed to be
secret.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Foreign Office said it was tightening
security procedures after a laptop computer that contained missing
training information for one of Britain's spy agencies was mislaid
and recovered by police two weeks later. News reports suggested
that an M16 agent left the laptop in a taxi after spending a night
drinking at a bar near the agency's headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Proposal on Supreme Court, TV  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD CARELLI
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill to require the Supreme Court to
televise its public sessions was introduced in the Senate on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed legislation says the nation's highest court ''shall
permit'' televised coverage of the 70 to 80 oral arguments it hears
each year unless a majority of the nine justices concludes that
doing so in a particular case would violate someone's rights.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was introduced by Sens. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., and
Joseph Biden, D-Del.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since the Supreme Court ... has assumed the power to decide
cutting-edge issues of public policy virtually as a
super-legislature, the public has a right to know what the court is
doing,'' a release from Specter's office said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Without interfering with the independent judiciary or
challenging the Supreme Court's power for the final word in
interpreting the Constitution, the Congress has the authority to
legislate on the Supreme Court's operations,'' the release said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no Supreme Court response to the bill. But in a 1996
letter to Specter, Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist said the
justices ''periodically considered the question of allowing live
television and radio coverage ... and a majority are of the view
that it would be unwise to depart from our current practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The court is notoriously camera-shy. Testifying before a Senate
subcommittee four years ago, Justice David H. Souter said, ''The
day you see a camera come into our courtroom it's going to roll
over my dead body.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the court's work is done behind closed doors. Of the
more than 8,000 cases that reach the court each
October-through-June term, about 70 or 80 are granted full review.
In those, lawyers for both sides appear before the court, usually
in hour-long public sessions, before the justices begin the task of
reaching their decision.
</P>
<P>
   The court does audiotape its arguments, and those tapes are made
publicly available after each term.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on cameras in all federal courts dates back to 1937. The
prohibition was partially interrupted for several years by a
now-ended experiment that let individual courts decide whether to
allow electronic coverage of courtroom proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Also pending before the Senate is a bill that would let
presiding federal judges decide whether to allow electronic media
coverage on a case-by-case basis.
</P>
<P>
   The Radio-Television News Directors Association said Thursday it
supported the bill proposed by Specter and Biden. ''The arguments
sometimes used against allowing television coverage, such as danger
to the rights of defendants or undue pressure on witnesses and
jurors, simply do not apply to the Supreme Court,'' said the
group's president, Barbara Cochran.

<HEADLINE> FEMA rejects appeal for aid to flood-damaged Fairfield County  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - The Federal Emergency Management Agency
rejected a second request Thursday for aid for flood-damaged parts
of Bridgeport and Stratford.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA said the flood damage was not severe enough to warrant a
major disaster declaration. The agency also said that the damage
does not appear to be greater than what the state and local
governments can handle.
</P>
<P>
   The agency issued similar findings last month. Gov. John G.
Rowland appealed that decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rowland's office said the U.S. Small Business Administration may
be able to offer low-interest loans to homeowners and business
owners damaged by the flood. The Connecticut Development Authority
already has approved below-market loans for people whose property
was damaged in the flood.
</P>
<P>
   The storm dumped torrential rain on the area August 11 and 12.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the state found that 260 homes and 30 businesses
were damaged, with downtown Stratford was hit the hardest. At least
24 businesses in Stratford sustained major damage, and many of the
businesses were not insured.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the appeal, a reassessment of the damage was done,
said John Wiltse, the state's director of emergency management.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the state found 471 homes and 61 businesses that were
damaged, but only five of these properties had the kind of major
damage that FEMA is looking for, Wiltse said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We feel we had a strong case with FEMA, especially after we
reassessed and nearly doubled the numbers,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep Rosa DeLauro, whose district includes Stratford, set up
a meeting with state and local leaders for Friday to discuss what
else can be done.

<HEADLINE> Teen sanctioned by SEC is a market veteran at age 15  </HEADLINE>
By JEFFREY GOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   CEDAR GROVE, N.J. (AP) - The New Jersey teen-ager who became the
youngest person sanctioned by the Securities and Exchange
Commission is no newcomer to the market.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan G. Lebed, 15, a junior at Cedar Grove High School, says
he has been fascinated by finance since he was 11.
</P>
<P>
   He soon started trading, and by eighth grade, he and two friends
were among the finalists in CNBC's stock-picking contest.
</P>
<P>
   He became a ''very active'' trader, an SEC official said
Thursday, a day after the agency announced the boy would pay them
$285,000 to settle charges he profited by selling stocks he
promoted with baseless information.
</P>
<P>
   ''It intrigued me watching all the numbers go by on
television,'' the teen told The Wall Street Journal in Thursday's
editions.
</P>
<P>
   Cedar Grove High School classmate Nicole Basalyga said teachers
and students spent the day asking Lebed for stock tips. Friend Tom
McCarthy, 16, said he knew the student, who was known to carry a
leather briefcase to school, was trading on the Internet, but ''he
never told people how much he was making.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebed left Cedar Grove High School Thursday in the back seat of
a car driven by friends who cursed at reporters as they left.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Gregory Lebed, told reporters at the family's home,
''I'm proud of my son,'' but declined to comment further.
</P>
<P>
   The teen operates two E-commerce companies: PR Host, which
serves as a home for business Web sites, and Promotion Solutions,
which sells e-mail addresses and provides advice on business
marketing, he told The Star-Ledger of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site for PR Host boasts that the company is among the
''fastest-growing hosting companies on the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was a series of online trades while he was 14 that led
the SEC to charge him with illegal stock manipulation in 11
instances from Aug. 23, 1999, to Feb. 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The agency said he was the first minor it has sued.
</P>
<P>
   Under the settlement, Lebed agreed to repay $285,000, which the
SEC said represented illegal profits and interest. He neither
admitted nor denied the commission's findings, but agreed to
refrain from similar behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC alleged a ''pump and dump'' scheme: Lebed bought large
blocks of nine low-priced stocks, hyped them on Internet financial
message boards, watched the prices rise, and then sold - all within
24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   But those 11 trades are just a fraction of Lebed's activity,
said Joy Thompson, associate director of the SEC's Philadelphia
office, which handled the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We looked at thousands of trades. He was a very active trader.
These 11, we felt, were the strongest case, where he clearly
violated the anti-fraud provisions,'' Thompson said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed lawyer Kevin H. Marino declined to make the boy available
for an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The family has an unlisted phone number, and efforts to reach
Lebed at school or at home Thursday were not immediately
successful. An e-mail sent to Lebed via PR Host did not get an
immediate reply.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed told reporters on Wednesday he could not comment on the
SEC case, but spoke about how he got interested in trading:
watching CNBC at age 11.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, one of his earliest picks was America Online
because it was offering unlimited access, he told the Journal: ''I
bought shares of AOL at $25. The next day it was up a few points.''
He said he sold when it hit $30.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has urged Cedar Grove officials to get high-speed
Internet access in the township.
</P>
<P>
   A message left Thursday for the township manager was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   For the future, he's considering attending culinary school while
continuing with his Internet businesses, The Star-Ledger said.
</P>
<P>
   Will this episode hurt him? ''I don't think so,'' he told The
Star-Ledger.
</P>
<P>
   Regulators said the case demonstrates the risks of Internet
stock tips, especially in thinly traded issues.
</P>
<P>
   Lebed traded in custodial accounts in his father's name at two
brokers, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The nine stocks in which he agreed to disgorge profits from 11
trades were traded on the NASD Over the Counter Electronic Bulletin
Board or the NASDAQ National Market: Manchester Equipment Co. Inc.,
Just Toys Inc., Yes Entertainment Inc., Fotoball USA Inc., Man Sang
Holdings Inc., West Coast Entertainment Inc., Havana Republic Inc.,
Classica Group Inc. and Firetector Inc., according to SEC
documents.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC found that after Lebed bought a stock he sent hundreds
of identical, false e-mail messages, each under a fictitious name,
touting the stock he had just purchased.
</P>
<P>
   His profits on each trade ranged from more than $11,000 to
nearly $74,000, ultimately totaling $272,826. The $285,000
settlement reflects prejudgment interest of $12,174.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Health officials: West Nile virus is here to stay  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) - Even though cooler weather soon will slow
the spread of the West Nile virus as mosquitoes go into
hibernation, the disease appears to be here to stay because the
insects retain the virus throughout the winter, health officials
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   State Health Commissioner Christine Grant said New Jersey and
surrounding states will have to deal with the potentially deadly
virus again next year, and probably well beyond that.
</P>
<P>
   ''As the nights get colder and we have the first ground frost,
mosquitoes go into hibernation and the risk will lessen
considerably,'' she said during a news briefing on New Jersey's
response to the virus, which has infected two human beings in the
Garden State so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   ''But we've also learned that the mosquitoes continue to carry
the virus during the winter,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The West Nile virus is transmitted through the bite of a
mosquito that has picked up the virus by feeding on an infected
bird. It was first identified in the Western Hemisphere in
September 1999, causing 62 cases of encephalitis in New York and
seven deaths. This year, there have been 11 human cases in New York
City, including eight in Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   Figures released Thursday by the state health department showed
no new human cases over the past week. Test results are being
awaited from 34 people in New Jersey who have shown many of the
symptoms associated with the disease.
</P>
<P>
   The only human cases confirmed so far in New Jersey are a
43-year-old man from Jersey City and a 54-year-old man with homes
in Brooklyn, N.Y., and Cliffside Park.
</P>
<P>
   The head of the federal Centers for Disease Control, Dr. Jeffrey
P. Koplan, visited Bergen County Thursday to review the state's
efforts to combat the virus, calling them ''a textbook example'' of
how to deal with a public health threat.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't fully understand the epidemiology or the full public
health implications of this new virus, but the right things are
being done,'' he said, referring to the state's reporting system,
localized spraying programs and outreach efforts.
</P>
<P>
   So far, 838 crows and one cockatiel have tested positive for the
virus in New Jersey this year out of 1,527 crows that were tested.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials also admitted they're disappointed and somewhat
puzzled over the failure of the so-called ''sentinel chickens'' to
detect the presence of the virus. Blood samples taken weekly from
chickens in all 21 counties have all tested negative for the virus,
even though crows in 16 counties have tested positive for it.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wayne Crans of Rutgers University said the poultry program
was borrowed from Florida, where the caged birds had a good track
record in identifying St. Louis encephalitis, a disease which is
very similar to the West Nile virus.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone figured that method would work,'' he said. ''It's
fairly obvious it has not. They are obviously not being bitten by
the mosquitoes carrying the virus, and we can only speculate that
it's a behavioral thing. If I were a mosquito looking for a bird,
I'd look up; the chickens are down.''

<HEADLINE> Man arrested in Mantua robbery admits to other NJ bank robberies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - A man who was arrested Wednesday after a
Mantua bank robbery admitted he robbed several other banks across
the state, authorities said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   FBI Special Agent Robert Norton in the Philadelphia office
identified the suspect as Hoyt K. Ellis, 29. Ellis told authorities
he was from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   Camden County Sheriff Michael W. McLaughlin said Ellis admitted
to at least three robberies in northern New Jersey and several more
in southern New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Police said the suspect handed a teller a note at the Colonial
Bank on Lambs Road in Mantua, was given an undisclosed amount of
cash and drove off.
</P>
<P>
   The suspect was arrested by a Camden County Sheriff's officer on
Route 676 here shortly after the 1 p.m. robbery. The officer heard
a police radio broadcast giving a description of the man and pulled
him over.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI searched his car and found an AK-47 rifle and money from
the Mantua robbery, McLaughlin said.

<HEADLINE> India Salt Ruling Raises Controversy  </HEADLINE>
By NIRMALA GEORGE
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- A government move to put cheap salt
without iodine back on the market threatens the health of millions
among India's most vulnerable groups, poor children and pregnant
women, health experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure from small business lobbies, the government last
week lifted a ban in force for a decade and a half that prevents
non-iodized salt being sold in India.
</P>
<P>
   Health and humanitarian officials immediately slammed the
government move, saying it would seriously affect efforts to
eradicate iodine deficiency in India, so far one of the country's
few public health success stories.
</P>
<P>
   A lack of iodine causes goiter, or the enlargement of the
thyroid glands. It also results in a greater number of miscarriages
in pregnant women and a higher incidence of mental retardation,
deaf-mutism and impaired learning capacities in children.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with the controversy, India's health minister, C.P.
Thakur, insisted Thursday iodized salt would continue to be
available throughout the country and announced the government would
subsidize it to make it affordable to the poor.
</P>
<P>
   The move came a day after the United Nations Children's Fund
criticized the move to allow non-iodized salts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The decision to drop the ban is likely to have grave
consequences for the health of India's population, especially two
of its most vulnerable groups, young children and pregnant women,''
it said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. N Kochupillai, head of Endocrinology at the All India
Institute of Medical Sciences, said the lifting of the ban was ''a
retrograde step which will cause incalculable damage to future
generations of Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   India imposed the ban on non-iodized salt in the mid-1980s after
research conducted over two decades by the Indian Council of
Medical Research showed that people in many parts of the country
were not getting enough iodine in their diets.
</P>
<P>
   But the government has come under pressure from small-scale salt
producers who say their livelihoods are threatened because they
cannot afford to install iodization plants, according to Thakur.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Atal Behari Vajpayee's Bhartiya Janata Party was
lobbied by its political allies to lift the ban. The Swadeshi
Jagran Manch or Self-reliance Awakening Forum, argued that
multinationals had profited from the ban on non-iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
   Caught in the crossfire Thursday, the government promised to
bring down the price of iodized salt through state subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   But UNICEF, for one, thinks the move will cancel out its efforts
to improve basic health. Its statement called India's salt
iodization program one of the country's most successful public
health interventions.
</P>
<P>
   About 70 per cent of India's 1 billion people currently have
access to iodized salt, but this figure would go down now the ban
on non-iodized salt has been lifted, the UNICEF statement said.

<HEADLINE> Shays pushes for moratorium on tribal recognitions  </HEADLINE>
By ADAM GORLICK
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - The federal government should stop recognizing
American Indian tribes for the next six months and investigate the
recognition process, a handful of Republican House members said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., accused the Clinton
administration of letting donations from tribes and supporters of
tribal groups influence the recognition process.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration is playing fast and loose in this
process,'' Shays said. He refused to give specifics, though he
accused officials from the Bureau of Indian Affairs of selectively
quoting from experts' opinions to support tribal recognitions.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a plethora of money that is coming into play and that
is distorting the process,'' Shays said.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanie Hanna, a spokeswoman with the Department of the
Interior which oversees the BIA, called Shays' accusations
''absolutely ridiculous.'' Since 1980, 15 tribes have received BIA
recognition and 15 have been turned down, Hanna said.
</P>
<P>
   ''There have been hardly any tribes recognized during the
Clinton administration,'' said Hanna. ''And the ones that have gone
through an extensive process.''
</P>
<P>
   There are currently 227 tribes seeking federal recognition - 11
of which are in Connecticut. The Paucatuck Easterns and the Eastern
Pequots, both of which claim descent from the historic Eastern
Pequot tribe, each recently won preliminary recognition from the
BIA. The federal agency is seeking to determine if those groups,
which share a reservation in North Stonington, represent two tribes
or one.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., said there should be a six-month
moratorium on recognitions while the GAO investigates the process.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to make sure the process is so sound that you can say,
whether you're a member of a tribe or a member of the outside
community, that the process was fair,'' Wolf said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a tribe gets federal recognition, it can obtain rights to
build a casino.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf said his call for a recognition moratorium is not related
to his opposition to a bid by eight Virginia tribes to win federal
recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Hanna said a moratorium is useless because it sometimes takes as
long as three years for a tribe to be recognized. However, she said
it's likely there will be a few tribes that are recognized within
the next six months.
</P>
<P>
   Connecticut Attorney General Richard Blumenthal has also
requested a temporary halt to tribal recognitions, but BIA Director
Kevin Gover told him this week that a moratorium would be
detrimental to the Indian groups seeking federal acknowledgment.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak Not on Self-Sufficient Track  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite more riders, Amtrak is not on track to
free itself from federal operating subsidies by a deadline set by
Congress, a government audit released Thursday found.
</P>
<P>
   The report by Transportation Department Inspector General
Kenneth Mead concludes that ''without major corrective action,''
the national railway will not achieve operating self-sufficiency by
2003.
</P>
<P>
   If Amtrak fails to meet the deadline, Congress could vote to
liquidate the corporation that has overseen intercity passenger
rail since 1971.
</P>
<P>
   The report also questions Amtrak's decision to spend capital
funds to expand service and introduce new routes rather than to pay
for ''minimum needs'' like track repair. The inspector general's
office predicts a shortfall of $91 million next year in funds for
minimum needs.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of the report is in striking contrast to Amtrak's
consistently upbeat reports of financial progress. Just last week,
Amtrak announced it had registered its best summer ever and expects
to break the all-time yearly record of 22.2 million passengers, set
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mead's report does not dispute that claim but provides a more
complete picture by including information on expenses, not just
revenue and riders.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although ridership and revenue trends are positive,'' the
report says, ''increases in labor costs, depreciation and train
operation expenses have fueled continued growth in operating
expenses'' of 6.9 percent in 1999 and 7.3 percent in the first nine
months of 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The inspector general forecasts that Amtrak will lose $1.4
billion more than it anticipates from 2000 through 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Mead's office estimates Amtrak's cash loss in 2000 will be $521
million, the lowest since 1992. But it says Amtrak must reduce its
cash loss to $266 million in 2003 to meet Congress' mandate, and
that will be possible only by ''limiting the growth in Amtrak's
expenses over the next three years.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak does not have to eliminate its cash loss entirely because
the government will continue to pay some of its costs, like
equipment depreciation.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak released a statement agreeing ''that strong efforts will
be necessary to achieve operational self-sufficiency, as mandated
by Congress. We believe we're up to that challenge, and that our
recent business successes demonstrate our resolve.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak officials hope the report's emphasis on a shortage of
capital funds prompts Congress to pass legislation authorizing the
railway to raise $10 billion over 10 years for new high-speed rail
corridors throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak maintains it will reach self-sufficiency in 2002, a year
ahead of schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Mead will testify Tuesday at a Senate Commerce Committee
oversight hearing on Amtrak.

<HEADLINE> Boy identifies defendant as man who molested him  </HEADLINE>
By JIM FITZGERALD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - A 10-year-old boy in a courtroom
witness box calmly pointed to a former teacher Thursday and said
the man had molested him in his own bed, then borrowed a
smiley-face pillow and bedded down on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   The last time he'd seen defendant Steven Nowicki, the boy said,
was ''in my room'' on New Year's Day 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki looked directly at the witness as the boy identified him
but glanced away for most of his 3&AMP;frac12; hours of testimony in
Westchester County Court.
</P>
<P>
   The former Dobbs Ferry Middle School teacher is accused of
molesting the boy and his older brother after their father,
thinking him drunk, invited him to ''sleep it off'' following the
family's New Year's Eve party.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, in a button-down shirt and a blazer, held a microphone
in his hand and often squeezed his eyes shut as if to concentrate
before answering the prosecutor's questions. Not until the last
question of his cross-examination did he lose his composure,
choking up when the defense focused on his uncertainty over who
turned on a bedroom light.
</P>
<P>
   In gentler questioning by Assistant District Attorney Lisa
Linsky, the boy, who was 8 at the time, said he'd gone to sleep
quickly after the excitement of being allowed to stay up past
midnight to see the new year in.
</P>
<P>
   He testified in clinical detail about being awakened first by a
noise, then again by a man touching and licking him.
</P>
<P>
   The boy said, ''Stop,'' but got no response, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt scared,'' he testified. The man was bigger and
stronger, and the boy felt ''he would just throw me back'' if he
tried to get up. ''I thought he would kidnap me,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   After some time, the boy said, the man climbed a ladder to his
older brother's upper bunk.
</P>
<P>
   He said he could not see the man's face in the dark and didn't
realize who it was until the man opened the bedroom door to leave
and light came in from the hallway. He knew it was Nowicki, the boy
said, ''by the shape of his hair on the back of his head.''
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki returned later, the boy testified, and said, ''Hi,
boys.'' His brother fled to his parents' bedroom and Nowicki asked
for a stuffed animal to sleep on, he said. The younger brother gave
him ''a yellow circle thing with a happy face on it,'' and Nowicki
lay on the floor with his head on the pillow, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then the boy's father came in and told him to join his mother
and brother, he said.
</P>
<P>
   When defense lawyer John Mangialardi went through the incident
on cross-examination, the boy told the story differently, leaving
out the entire encounter between him and the man in the dark.
</P>
<P>
   ''The man ... hadn't touched you?'' the lawyer asked. Then the
boy said, ''He was touching me. Then he stopped and went up the
ladder.''
</P>
<P>
   Mangialardi also brought out that the boy was neither physically
injured nor threatened and had not always mentioned his fear of
being kidnapped. The defense lawyer also pointed out
inconsistencies between the boy's testimony Thursday and his
previous comments to police, hospital personnel and a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   Nowicki, 37, of Hastings-on-Hudson, who was the older brother's
fifth-grade teacher, is accused of sodomy, sexual abuse and
endangering children. If convicted he could be sentenced to up to
25 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Jeanine Pirro attended part of the court
session, and the defense attorney complained afterward that she had
been ''making comments out loud,'' including one critical of him.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Judge Mary Smith to remind Pirro about ''courtroom
decorum.'' The judge said she hadn't heard any comments and doubted
the jury had.
</P>
<P>
   David Hebert, a spokesman for Pirro, said she ''did not make any
comments while she was in the courtroom today. ... This is nothing
more than an underhanded defense tactic to detract from the
testimony of the young boy today.''

<HEADLINE> Sick Nuke Workers Petition Congress  </HEADLINE>
By KATHERINE RIZZO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sick weapons plant workers begged lawmakers
Thursday to work out their differences and approve compensation for
people who contracted diseases building the nation's nuclear
arsenal.
</P>
<P>
   Sam Ray of Lucasville, Ohio, a 40-year uranium enrichment plant
employee, held a voice synthesizer to his throat so he could
describe working without protective clothing or radiation
monitoring.
</P>
<P>
   ''Workers were kept in the dark about the hazards they faced,''
said Ray, who suffers from a rare bone cancer and had his larynx
removed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even to this day, we don't know what we confronted,'' he told
the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration and Claims.
</P>
<P>
   Ann Orick, an ailing former weapons plant worker from Knoxville,
Tenn., said workers have been ''left out in the cold.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is not right that we should have to come here to plead for
a bill to pass. We're not asking for the moon. We're just asking
for some help,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring the Energy Department reversed 50 years of federal
policy by declaring that workers injured or killed by weapons-plant
exposure be compensated. The agency proposed minimum lump sum
payments of $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   House and Senate negotiators are meeting to try to work out a
compromise. Among the issues being discussed are the compensation
amount, which diseases will be covered and whether health benefits
would be included.
</P>
<P>
   ''If it doesn't pass now, it will be years,'' Energy Secretary
Bill Richardson told the committee. ''A lot of these workers will
lose hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Ray Slaughter of Las Vegas said he has silicosis, a
lung-clogging disease, from his work at the Nevada Test Site boring
tunnels where nuclear devices were to be detonated.
</P>
<P>
   ''No respirator protection was provided,'' he said. ''The dust
was so thick, you couldn't see your hand in front of your face.''
</P>
<P>
   Clara Harding poignantly described her husband Joe's slow death
after years of working at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant in
Kentucky, which enriched uranium for use in nuclear bombs.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was so proud of getting a job like that, working for the
government on such an important mission,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But then came sores that wouldn't heal; mysterious internal
injuries that led surgeons to remove a large part of his stomach;
and fingernail- and toenail-like growths on his palms, the bottoms
of his feet, his knee caps, knuckles, wrists and elbows.
</P>
<P>
   Too sick to work by the age of 50, she said her husband was
turned down for disability retirement and fired from his job as a
chemical operator. He died in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   ''DOE killed my husband,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After listening to workers, Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, predicted
passage this year of a national compensation program.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is broad-based support in Congress to compensate the
workers,'' he said. ''I think it ought to be done sooner rather
than later, and I think before the end of this Congress.''

<HEADLINE> Judge upholds $27 million jury award in Yale medical malpractice case </HEADLINE>
By NATASHA GURAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A judge on Thursday upheld a multimillion
dollar jury award to the estate of a man whose parents sued Yale
University after he suffered brain damage and went blind following
surgery at Yale-New Haven Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in March 1999 awarded $27 million to the parents of Billy
Jacobs, who claimed that doctors were negligent and performed
unnecessary surgery on their son in November 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs, then 17, had been recovering from injuries he suffered
in a car accident when William and Arlene Jacobs of Wappingers
Falls, N.Y. brought him to Yale-New Haven because of recurring
fevers.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a medical malpractice case involving truly horrifying
injury,'' New Haven Superior Judge Jon C. Blue wrote in a 36-page
decision. ''Under these circumstances, the jury's award of $27
million in damages, while anecdotally the highest personal injury
award in Connecticut legal history, is fair but not extravagant.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Jacobs, now 30, is legally blind, mentally retarded and
can walk only short distances with assistance. William Jacobs quit
his job as a deputy sheriff after the surgery so he could care
full-time for his son who is confined mostly to a bed and
wheelchair at home.
</P>
<P>
   ''The clients are relieved and they've been through an ordeal
which comes after many, many years,'' said the Jacobs' attorney,
Michael Koskoff of Bridgeport. ''Their life is one of incomparable
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Hospital officials said Thursday that Yale planned to appeal the
decision in a higher court.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are obviously disappointed with Judge Blue's decision since
we continue to believe that we have solid grounds for setting aside
the jury's verdict in this case,'' Yale-New Haven said in an
official statement. ''We look forward to presenting these important
issues to Connecticut's Supreme Court or Appellate Court and remain
confident that the appellate courts will ultimately agree with us
that the jury's verdict in this case was defective, erroneous and
excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the accident, Billy was a healthy high school senior who
enjoyed dancing and worked two jobs, said Koskoff. He aspired to
become an X-ray technician.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors at Yale-New Haven said Billy Jacobs had a ruptured
aorta. Chief cardiologist Dr. John Elefteriades decided to operate
on Nov. 15, 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Koskoff said Billy never had a hole that required surgery, only
a small tear of the ''intima,'' or inner layer, of his aorta.
</P>
<P>
   ''The skill with which the operation was conducted was a
disputed fact in this case,'' Blue wrote. ''The results of the
surgery were disastrous. A massive hemorrhage developed during the
application of a clamp, and Billy Jacobs lost enormous quantities
of blood.''
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, the hospital claimed that some of Billy's
injuries were caused by the earlier car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Four people were killed in the Oct. 26, 1986 accident in
Wappingers Falls, including Billy's 15-year-old brother,
Christopher. But Koskoff said Billy had had successful surgery at
another hospital to repair injuries he received in the car accident
- including a lacerated bowel and diaphragm - and was recovering
when he sought treatment at Yale-New Haven for his fevers.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for Yale filed several post-trial motions, including
requests to set aside the verdict and for a new trial.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision Thursday, Blue denied all the motions.

<HEADLINE> Torricelli-backed ad targets supporter of Torricelli-backed bill  </HEADLINE>
By LAURENCE ARNOLD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - As a senator representing New Jersey, Democrat
Robert Torricelli proposed helping a home-state pharmaceutical
company extend its patent on the allergy drug Claritin.
</P>
<P>
   But as chairman of the Democratic Party's Senate campaign
effort, Torricelli helped fund an advertising campaign criticizing
Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., for supporting the very same idea.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's dueling roles have prompted cries of hypocrisy. An
Ashcroft spokesman called the ad fraudulent. The Missouri
Republican Party responded with an ad accusing Ashcroft's
challenger, Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan, of ''assaulting the
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli said Thursday he supports the legislation he
introduced on behalf of Schering-Plough Corp. and disagrees with
the theme of the anti-Ashcroft ad.
</P>
<P>
   But he chose not to block the ad, which was paid for by the
Missouri Democratic Party with funds provided by the Torricelli-led
Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''The DSCC was not created exclusively to advance the interests
of New Jersey or to represent my views,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic ad assails Ashcroft for cosponsoring ''special
legislation for Claritin's New Jersey manufacturer to keep cheaper,
generic varieties off the market.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Ashcroft's bill means consumers pay more and the company makes
billions,'' the ad says.
</P>
<P>
   The ad also criticizes Ashcroft for accepting a $50,000
contribution from Schering-Plough to a campaign committee he
controls. Schering-Plough gave the same amount to the DSCC on May
26, 1999, just one day before Torricelli introduced the bill to
help the company pursue a patent extension. Torricelli says the
timing was a coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli, who has won acclaim from his party for raising
record amounts for the campaign effort, said the ad ''represents
the position of the Democratic Party of Missouri.''
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged that he is in ''an awkward position,''
affiliated with a political ad that condemns his own legislative
cause. He said he expects to find himself in the same position
again soon, when the DSCC goes after Republican senators for
supporting tax cuts. Torricelli has broken with Democrats to
support some tax-cut proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Torricelli's Claritin bill would let Schering-Plough petition
the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for three years of additional
patent protection on grounds that the Food and Drug Administration
took an excessively long time to approve the use of the drug.
</P>
<P>
   Senators from both parties have blocked efforts to attach the
Claritan language to must-pass spending bills.
</P>
<P>
   William O'Donnell, a spokesman for Madison, N.J.-based
Schering-Plough, responded to the ad flap by saying, ''We think
it's unfortunate that a measure which is designed to take issues of
patent inequities out of politics should become the subject of
political campaigning.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Food and Drug Administration approved a
six-month extension for Schering-Plough's exclusive marketing of
Claritin. That means a less expensive version of the drug cannot be
introduced before December 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the six-month extension could mean an extra $1
billion in sales before Claritin must compete with a cheaper
generic pill. It may also help Schering-Plough launch a
next-generation Claritin medicine before a generic can erode its
market share.

<HEADLINE> Veterans Affairs Computers At Risk  </HEADLINE>
By D. IAN HOPPER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Department of Veterans Affairs computers are
wide open to hackers and dishonest agency workers, putting
veterans' medical and financial information as well as VA funds at
risk, department officials said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The VA's top technical officials and their internal watchdog
office told the House Veterans Affairs' oversight subcommittee that
when the department contracted a security company to see whether
their defenses were enough, the hackers had no trouble breaking in
to the system with simple tools, taking total control of it.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Slachta Jr., an assistant inspector general at VA, said
that the hackers ''owned the system,'' while the department didn't
even know its systems were attacked.
</P>
<P>
   To stunned legislators, Slachta testified that the hackers had
access to the confidential data of veterans, including their
personal histories, and medical and financial information. They
could also get into VA's internal data and business systems.
</P>
<P>
   Slachta said the testing was just done on Veterans Benefits
Administration computers, but the hackers got access to the VA's
''backbone,'' giving them free rein over all of VA's systems,
including the Veterans Health Administration, which holds sensitive
medical records for VA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was chagrined at how fast we got in,'' Slachta said in an
interview with The Associated Press. He said he didn't like
divulging so many details of the VA's security scheme, but ''it's
important that this comes out and be corrected.''
</P>
<P>
   Money as well as information was up for grabs through the
security holes. The officials testified that in two case, VA
employees used the weaknesses to write themselves more than $1.2
million in fraudulent benefit checks. They said ''dozens'' more
fraud cases are under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers called the news frightening, and called for changes.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we in Congress and the VA have something that we need
to get a handle on right away,'' said Rep. Corrine Brown, D-Fla.,
ranking member of the subcommittee. ''We've got to make sure that
this is tightened up, there's no question about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I find this revelation extremely scary,'' said subcommittee
Chairman Terry Everett, R-Ala.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey placed the blame on the Clinton
administration.
</P>
<P>
   ''These studies make me ask again, how can this administration
talk about protecting privacy when their own departments and
agencies put some of our most private information at risk?'' Armey
said.
</P>
<P>
   The VA officials said some of the security holes have been
repaired since the tests occurred in December 1999 and January
2000, but that there's still a lot of work to do.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have corrected the major weaknesses that we have
identified, and are in the process of completing our
recommendations by the end of this year,'' Slachta said. ''But I
haven't verified that.''
</P>
<P>
   A report released by a House subcommittee on technology, using
information from the General Accounting Office, gave the federal
government a ''D-'' overall for information security. Previously,
the Environmental Protection Agency has been singled out in a GAO
report for lax computer protection systems.
</P>
<P>
   Everett directly asked Robert P. Bubniak, the acting deputy
assistant secretary for information technology at the department
the question that would be on the minds of veterans who take
advantage of VA services.
</P>
<P>
   ''How can you reassure veterans and their families that hackers
and other unauthorized VA employees have not intruded into their
personal financial and medical information maintained by the VA?''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Bubniak: ''I cannot.''

<HEADLINE> Report: N. Korea Improving Military  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Despite its severe economic crisis, North
Korea has made major military improvements including placing large
numbers of artillery guns and rocket launchers near the
Demilitarized Zone that separates communist North from the
U.S.-backed South Korea, a Pentagon report says.
</P>
<P>
   While noting the positive outcome of a North-South summit
meeting in June, the Pentagon report to Congress described North
Korean President Kim Jong-il as bent on bolstering his nation's
preparedness for war.
</P>
<P>
   The North is in position to mount a major attack against the
outnumbered army of South Korea ''with minimal additional
preparation, although at great risk,'' the report said. It did not
predict renewed war between the Koreas, but stressed that ''the
Korean Peninsula remains a dangerous theater.''
</P>
<P>
   The report was provided to the House and Senate armed services
committees. A copy was provided to The Associated Press on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In assessing positive signs of change, 50 years after the start
of the Korean War, the report said the June summit meeting between
Kim and South Korean President Kim Dae-jung holds the promise of
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
   But it added that there are no firm indicators that the
communist North is ready to turn away from its long-standing goal
of reunifying the Koreas by force, or that it is undertaking true
economic reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in Seoul on Thursday after talks with his South Korean
counterpart, Defense Secretary William Cohen echoed the main themes
of the report to Congress. He said North Korea's chemical,
biological, nuclear and long-range missile programs continue to
pose a threat to South Korea and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen noted, however, that the first-ever meeting next week
between the defense ministers of South and North Korea could set
the stage for significant progress on reducing the threat of war.
</P>
<P>
   The major components of North Korea's economy -- power generation
and distribution, communications and transportation -- are failing.
If economic conditions worsen, ''we must consider that the North
Korean economy could break down completely,'' precipitating social
chaos, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   If that happens, there likely would be a flood of refugees and
the potential for a military coup or civil war, it added. On the
other hand, the economic aid the North will receive as a result of
the June summit makes this scenario less likely, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The report made these other points:
</P>
<P>
   --Fully 70 percent of the North's active-duty force is situated
within 100 miles of the Demilitarized Zone, or DMZ, that was
created as a buffer zone when the Korean War ended in a truce in
July 1953. That means there are about 700,000 troops, 8,000
artillery guns and 2,000 tanks near the DMZ.
</P>
<P>
   --Large numbers of long-range 240mm multiple rocker launcher
systems and 170mm self-propelled artillery guns have been moved to
sheltered sites near the DMZ within the last year. The North also
has placed more anti-tank barriers in that area and produced more
fighter aircraft in the last year.
</P>
<P>
   --The North is expanding its ammunition and equipment storage
capacities by building additional underground and sheltered
facilities near the DMZ. Current ammunition stockpiles are
estimated at over 1 million tons. A major war reserve of petroleum
exists in the North despite the country's severe fuel shortages.
</P>
<P>
   --Applying lessons learned from the U.S. military campaigns
against Iraq in 1991 and Yugoslavia in 1999, the North has modified
key defense facilities, dispersed its forces and improved its
camouflage and concealment effort.
</P>
<P>
   --The South Korean armed forces are smaller in number than the
North's, but when combined with the 37,000 American forces
stationed in the South they have a qualitative advantage. The
South's army numbers 560,000 troops, not counting a reserve force
of 3 million.

<HEADLINE> Mexico Hotel Becomes Jail for Iraqis  </HEADLINE>
By BEN FOX
<TEXT>
<P>
   TIJUANA, Mexico (AP) -- About 150 men, women and children were
being held Thursday by Mexican authorities in a shabby Tijuana
hotel that has become an internationally known way station for
Iraqi Christians seeking political asylum in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby San Diego, across the world's busiest border crossing,
45 more Iraqis were being detained by U.S. authorities after they
tried to enter the United States without visas Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't immediately known what prompted the crackdown at the
hotel. But the dingy Royal Suites clearly has become a key
gathering point for Iraqis, many of whom spend their life savings
just to reach Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ''I say to you death or asylum, nothing else!'' Talale Hanna
shouted as he leaned out a window of the four-story hotel. He said
adults inside were on a hunger strike and hadn't eaten in two days.
</P>
<P>
   Other Iraqis stared out a dusty hotel window at American
relatives waiting below. They were kept from leaving by Mexican
federal police in the lobby and the courtyard, some of them
carrying rifles.
</P>
<P>
   Iraqi refugees have been staying at the hotel while waiting for
American authorities to process asylum applications, according to
relatives. As some made it across into the United States, others
came from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ''This place is like the headquarters,'' said Mikha Faris, an
American citizen whose sister and brother-in-law are inside the
hotel. ''Everything was cool, nobody knew what was going on.''
</P>
<P>
   That changed Wednesday when Mexican authorities, perhaps
responding to a theft complaint, surrounded the hotel and took away
four Iraqis suspected of smuggling immigrants. Relatives said the
crackdown prompted scores of others to head for the U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that the immigrants have ended up in Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   The San Diego area, just a half-hour away, has the
second-largest community of Iraqi Chaldeans, who are Christian, in
the United States. The Detroit area has the largest.
</P>
<P>
   Chaldeans number about 800,000 worldwide, about half of whom are
in Iraq. Some 120,000 live in the United States, including an
estimated 15,000 in San Diego County.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives of those in the Tijuana hotel said a Chaldean family
made it to the border about six months ago and was granted asylum
in the United States. News of that spread around the world and
Iraqis -- who must travel overland because of U.N. sanctions on air
travel -- soon were coming to Tijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ''One called another and one called another and you see what is
happening now,'' Faris said.
</P>
<P>
   The number of applications from Iraqi Christians seeking asylum
at the San Ysidro, Calif., border crossing has increased from
virtually none last year to 172 in the past two months, said Robert
Looney, the Immigration and Naturalization Service director of
regional asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Immigrants can get asylum if they convince authorities they have
a credible fear of persecution in their home country. Many Iraqis
manage to do so.
</P>
<P>
   The Suites Royal is run down, with an old sign missing all but
one letter of the word ''hotel,'' and whole families share a room,
with some forced to sleep on the floor.
</P>
<P>
   But to reach the United States, they will put up with just about
anything, said Sam Abbod, an El Cajon, Calif., resident who has six
cousins detained at the hotel. He and other Iraqis regularly
visited their relatives, helping with expenses and legal advice.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me tell you how desperate my people are,'' he said. ''If
you tell them go to Somalia for six months and then you'll have a
chance to go to the U.S., they would go tomorrow.''

<HEADLINE> World War II Memorial Debated  </HEADLINE>
By CARL HARTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A World War II memorial proposed for the
National Mall was denounced Thursday as a ''confused set of
half-baked notions'' at a National Capital Planning Commission
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   But countering the objections of Rep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, the
District of Columbia's delegate, were two World War II veterans,
former Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Sen. Daniel K. Inouye,
D-Hawaii.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm a good friend of Eleanor's but we just happen to have a
disagreement here,'' Dole said. ''We'll try to lay it out and let
the commission decide, and that's what World War II was all about --
so we could have freedom of expression and have different views.''
</P>
<P>
   Dole urged approval of the design so there could be a
groundbreaking on Veterans Day.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has dedicated a site between the Washington
Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. But opponents argue the new
memorial would interfere with the vista between the structures.
</P>
<P>
   The memorial would sit at the head of the Reflecting Pool in
front of the Lincoln Memorial, with 56 pillars and two large
rainbow-shaped pools surrounding a sunken plaza.
</P>
<P>
   Two fountains would send jets of water, and wind sensors able to
reduce the flow would protect visitors from the spray. A wall of
gold stars would represent veterans killed in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ''Who would history blame for the unspeakably confused set of
half-baked notions before you that pass for a memorial, while
displaying at once a warped sense of the nation's history and
marring the simple vow of our noble World War II veterans?'' Norton
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dole has led a campaign that has raised nearly $140 million for
the new monument. Another veteran who helped in that effort was
Sen. Bob Kerrey, D-Neb., who was awarded the Medal of Honor for
bravery in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling that Kerrey had once criticized the design, Dole said
he told the Nebraska senator, ''You know, Bob, I'm not the
architect. I agreed to help raise the money.''
</P>
<P>
   Architect Friedrich St. Florian said the monument's central
sculpture by Ray Kasky is ''a work of art still in progress'' and
he did not know when the design would be ready.
</P>
<P>
   He told the commission that it would be no more than 15 feet
high and would not interfere with views of either the Lincoln
Memorial or the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, plans were announced Thursday for an education center
aimed at adding context to the 58,220 names on the Vietnam Veterans
Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters doubt legislation authorizing it will pass
Congress this term, in part because the World War II memorial and a
proposal to honor President Reagan may crowd it out.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Max Cleland, D-Ga., who lost three limbs in a grenade
blast, says he is frustrated by the delays in erecting memorials.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's part of our history, and it's a history we ought to
publicly acknowledge,'' Cleland said. ''When you reduce the
complexities of war down to an individual name, you realize an
individual American suffered for the country. Then when you see so
many, it's overwhelming.''

<HEADLINE> House OKs Pay Raise for VA Nurses  </HEADLINE>
By JANELLE CARTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A bill approved Thursday by the House to raise
the pay of Veterans Affairs nurses is drawing criticism from the
White House and others for a provision that allows veterans to get
medical care outside of VA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot program, which would be tested in four areas, was
included in the bill that passed overwhelmingly, 411-0.
</P>
<P>
   It is aimed at veterans who live a considerable distance from VA
medical facilities. Under the program, the agency would cover some
of the costs of care and services at non-VA hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a good bill for veterans,'' said Rep. Cliff Stearns,
R-Fla., chairman of the Veterans Affairs subcommittee on health.
''It contains provisions that are innovative, useful and
workable.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents fear the new program is the beginning of changing the
way the agency provides health care to the nation's veterans.
</P>
<P>
   ''It turns the Veterans Affairs Administration into another
insurance company instead of a health care provider,'' said Richard
A. Wannemacher Jr., assistant national legislative director for
medical affairs for the Disabled American Veterans. ''To save money
rather than provide quality health care is a disservice.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House released a statement saying that while it
supports the overall bill, the pilot program ''would jeopardize
VA's ability to manage veterans' care, undermine the ability of the
VA system to maintain specialized medical services, and create a
disparate eligibility status. . . This provision should be
deleted.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, veterans' groups supporting the program said it is
similar to services the agency already offers.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any service or any policy or procedure that will allow the
veteran to receive quicker and more effective treatment . . that
can only help veterans,'' said Len Selfon, veterans benefits
program director for the Vietnam Veterans of America.
</P>
<P>
   The nurses pay provisions drew little controversy. For years,
nurses pay has been set by local Veterans Affairs officials based
on community salaries.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would give some 30,000 Veterans Affairs nurses the
same annual pay increase other federal employees receive.
</P>
<P>
   ''VA nurses have waited for fair pay too long,'' said Rep. Lane
Evans of Illinois, the ranking Democrat on the House Veterans
Affairs Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Nurses make up the largest portion of the agency's work force.
Dentists also would get an increase under the measure. The White
House is pushing for a larger increase for dentists.

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 78; Nasdaq Falls 69  </HEADLINE>
By DUNSTAN PRIAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks closed mixed Thursday amid lingering
gloom on Wall Street about corporate profits and higher oil prices.
The uncertainty ended a two-day rally in the high-tech sector.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 77.60 at 10,765.52, a
shift away from the downward momentum of the past few sessions. But
broader indicators were lower. The Nasdaq composite index fell
68.57 to 3,828.87 and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 was off 2.29 at
1,449.05.
</P>
<P>
   Investors again unloaded stocks of companies that warned of
disappointing profits. Technology and brokerage firms were among
the hardest hit.
</P>
<P>
   That dynamic is all but guaranteed to continue Friday following
an announcement by Intel after the close of Thursday's session; the
world's largest chip maker said it expects third-quarter revenues
to fall below earlier expectations. After falling $1.58 to $61.48
during the regular session, shares of Intel plunged another $11.48
to $50 in after-hours trading.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of other high-tech companies also fell in the after-hours
session. Microsoft, which finished regular trading down 6 cents at
$64.19 on the Nasdaq Stock Market, fell an additional $3.56 to
$60.63. Cisco Systems finished the day down $2 at $61.13, then fell
$3.94 to $58.50 in the after-hours session. Dell Computer initially
dropped 63 cents to $37.94 Thursday, then fell $4 to $33.94 after
the Intel announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's selloff in the technology sector came despite a
report by one of Wall Street's most prominent analysts that the
economy remains quite favorable.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the end of the quarter and right now the concerns are oil
prices and earnings,'' said Barry Berman, head trader for Robert W.
Baird &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   In other trading, investors did boost Hertz up $7.38 to $31.63
on news that Ford wants to purchase all of the remaining stock in
the car rental company that Ford doesn't already own.
</P>
<P>
   Most other stocks fell. With the third-quarter earnings
reporting season just a few weeks away and increasing signs that
the U.S. economy is slowing, investors have been punishing stocks
whose companies fail to meet their expectations.
</P>
<P>
   Rising oil prices also have investors worried. The price of a
barrel on crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange was $36.33,
down from the $37 range it reached in recent days, but still at
levels not seen in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Tire maker Goodyear fell $2.88 to $18.13 after the company
warned that its quarterly earnings would be sluggish because of
higher oil prices and the weak euro, Europe's chief currency.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of a weakening in the wireless market sent Ericsson
Telephone down $1.58 to $16.42. Sprint PCS, which fell nearly 19
percent Wednesday after it warned of below expectations earning,
continued to fall, dropping $3 to $30.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley Dean Witter traded down $6.50 at $89.44 after the
brokerage firm's third-quarter earnings failed to meet Wall Street
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The market's search for sure bets meant that even companies that
beat analyst estimates were vulnerable. Investment bank Lehman
Brothers fell $2.94 to $141.50, primarily on profit-taking, a day
after its quarterly profits trounced analyst expectations by 62
cents a share.
</P>
<P>
   Even a report by Goldman Sachs analyst Abby Joseph Cohen stating
that high oil prices, the weak euro and corporate profit concerns
will be short-lived failed to calm inevstors. She also reiterated
that U.S. economic conditions remain quite favorable, particularly
in the areas of improved productivity and government policy.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered advancers 8 to 5 on the New York
Stock Exchange, where consolidated volume came to 1.3 billion
shares, down from Wednesday's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The Russell 2000 index was off 7.08 at 514.35.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.89 percent.
Germany's DAX index was down 1.22 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell
1.29 percent, and France's CAC-40 was off 2.35 percent.

<HEADLINE> Bill would end statute of limitations for homicide, manslaughter lawsuits </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Prosecutors have no time limit when
searching for justice in a murder. Families do.
</P>
<P>
   That's why advocates for victims' rights applauded the unanimous
vote Thursday by the Senate to eliminate legal time limits for
families looking to bring lawsuits after a homicide or
manslaughter.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation now goes to Gov. Christie Whitman. If she signs
the bill, New Jersey's two-year statute of limitations for lawsuits
would be history.
</P>
<P>
   Victim advocates say grief-stricken families don't think to file
lawsuits in time. Or they are told by prosecutors not to pursue
civil cases during criminal trials, supporters say.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers say the bill gives families the opportunity to collect
damages not just from defendants, but others. In cases where people
are killed during holdups, families could sue store owners who
didn't provide security.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's for the children really. Surviving parents just don't do
that. They don't sometimes file these lawsuits, whether they are in
shock or ill-advised,'' Kathy Garcia, director of South Jersey
Survivors of Violent Crime, said.
</P>
<P>
   If the measure becomes law, it would be the second in response
to the murder of Joan D'Alessandro, a 7-year-old raped and killed
as she delivered Girl Scout cookies in April 1973.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey passed ''Joan's Law'' in 1997, which denies parole to
anyone serving a life sentence for a violent crime that results in
the death of a child younger than 14. A federal version requires a
minimum of life imprisonment with no parole for anyone who commits
a violent crime resulting in the death of a child.
</P>
<P>
   It was a family inheritance Joseph McGowan, who was convicted of
killing Joan D'Alessandro, collected while in prison that prompted
this latest measure, bill sponsor John J. Matheussen, R-Gloucester,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Rosemarie D'Alessandro, the girl's mother, learned of the recent
windfall but was prevented from filing a lawsuit, Matheussen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''She wanted to collect not only for the loss of her daughter in
civil damages, but he was using the money to fund his appeals while
he was in prison,'' the senator said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill number S-1125 passed the Assembly by a 78-0 vote on June
29.
</P>
<P>
   If Whitman does sign it into law, New Jersey would join a
growing number of states that allow families to sue years after a
murder, said Jim Ferguson, director of the National Crime Victims
Bar Association.
</P>
<P>
   Idaho recently changed its law to allow lawsuits filed up to one
year after a defendant finishes a criminal sentence.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's pretty darn close to saying there isn't a limit,''
Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   Criminal cases usually have no time limit for charges, civil
cases should enjoy the same benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you're not going to have a statute of limitations in a
criminal proceeding, where what's on the line is a defendant's
freedom or his life, then it makes sense to have it where there's a
lot less at stake for a defendant,'' Ferguson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate on Thursday also passed another bill sponsored by
Matheussen to expand civil liabilities for criminals.
</P>
<P>
   That action would allow parents, children, spouses and siblings
of illegal drug users to sue drug dealers. Bill S-621, now heads to
the Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   States sue tobacco companies and gun manufactures for selling
legal goods, so it make sense to allow people to seek damages from
those that push illicit materials, Matheussen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're going to accept the liability, not just the criminal
liability, but the civil liability,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike other criminals, drug dealers often have assets that can
be seized, the senator said.

<HEADLINE> Jersey City mayor vetoes cell phone ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERSEY CITY, N.J. (AP) - Mayor Bret Schundler vetoed a measure
Thursday that would have made Jersey City the second New Jersey
community to ban cellular telephone use while driving.
</P>
<P>
   The councilman who sponsored the ordinance said he may seek an
override. City Council passed the ordinance by a 7-1 vote on Sept.
13. A two-thirds vote of the nine-member council is needed for an
override.
</P>
<P>
   In July, Marlboro Township became the first community in New
Jersey to prohibit the use of hand-held cellular telephones while
driving. Under its ban, anyone caught driving with a hand-held cell
phone is subject to a fine of up to $250.
</P>
<P>
   The Jersey City ordinance would fine violators between $200 and
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Fernando Colon said he has seen bus drivers talking
on cellular telephones in full buses and people arguing heatedly
while driving.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one is going to tell me that if you're in that mood you're
really concentrating,'' Colon said.
</P>
<P>
   Colon said he may seek a veto override at the council's Sept. 27
meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Schundler said the state should decide the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is simply unfair and impractical to expect drivers to learn
which of New Jersey's 566 municipalities permit them to drive while
speaking on their cellular phones and which do not,'' Schundler
said.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said police are already empowered to cite
motorists for reckless driving, which could stem from cellular
telephone use.

<HEADLINE> Two judges quit, protesting assignments  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two Superior Court judges in Essex County
quit this week after they were reassigned to handle landlord-tenant
cases.
</P>
<P>
   Judges Murray Simon and Harry Margolis, both veteran jurists,
said the assignments were not suited to their experience.
</P>
<P>
   Simon, 80, and Margolis, 72, are in semiretirement and currently
work on a per-diem basis. Judges have a mandatory retirement age of
70 but often serve on recall after that age.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think this is the way you treat judges who are on
recall and working gratuitously much of the time,'' Margolis told
The Star-Ledger of Newark in Thursday editions.
</P>
<P>
   Assignment Judge Joseph A. Falcone said he assigned Margolis and
Simon to pick up the landlord-tenant caseload temporarily because
one of the two judges who handled those cases recently was moved to
the family division and he has about a dozen judicial vacancies.
Falcone said he could not tell the judges how long the assignments
would last.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing but the highest regard for these two judges,''
Falcone said. ''I'm sorry we couldn't work something out.''
</P>
<P>
   Simon and Margolis had both been on the bench since the early
1970s and both spent several years as presiding judge in chancery
court, a prestigious assignment.

<HEADLINE> First lady attacks Lazio's ''happy talk'' view of upstate New York  </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - In this careworn industrial city, Hillary
Rodham Clinton attacked her U.S. Senate opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio,
on Thursday for attempting to ''dismiss with happy talk'' upstate
New York's prolonged economic troubles.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be one of the people who helps get us out of the
woods and not get further lost in the morass, and he doesn't have
any plan to do that,'' said the first lady, pledging to make
revitalization of the upstate economy her ''No. 1 priority'' if
elected.
</P>
<P>
   Her remarks at a Rotary Club luncheon honed in once more on a
theme that re-emerged during a debate here last week when Lazio,
the Republican congressman from Long Island, said he rejected the
notion that ''somehow the upstate economy is on its knees. It's
not.''
</P>
<P>
   In her latest television ad aimed at upstate viewers, Mrs.
Clinton stresses the need to bring ''targeted economic help'' to
the upstate economy.
</P>
<P>
   Among ''the cold hard facts that some would have us ignore or
paper over or try to dismiss with happy talk,'' she said, are job
growth that lags nearly every other state in the country and the
migration of 170,000 people ages 20 to 29 out of upstate New York
in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ''There are just 13 metropolitan areas nationwide that lost a
greater portion of their residents than Buffalo, and three of those
13 were upstate neighbors - Elmira, Binghamton and Utica,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Fractured in large part by the collapse of the steel industry,
Buffalo's population has fallen to around 300,000 from 358,000 in
1980. Mrs. Clinton also cited a Buffalo News survey that identified
Buffalo residents as ''the most highly taxed citizens in the
nation.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I'm very optimistic about what can be done but I don't
think we can do what we need to do ... if we deny that we have a
problem,'' Mrs. Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, visiting a windows manufacturing plant in Johnstown, 38
miles northwest of Albany, said he believed that ''there's much
more work to do'' in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   But ''compared to where the upstate economy was in the late '80s
and early '90s - which were years of high taxes, job loss,
factories moving out of state - I believe that the upstate economy
has turned the corner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, he said, ''would like people to believe that the
upstate economy is some type of vast economic wasteland. I do not
believe that.''

<HEADLINE> Israel Border Police Confronts Own  </HEADLINE>
By RON KAMPEAS
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- One time, the assailants dragged three men out
of a car, severely beat them, and then posed for photos, boots
triumphantly on neck. Another time, they beat a man senseless in an
argument over a soccer field.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, the attackers wore the distinctive dark green
khakis of Israel's Border Police.
</P>
<P>
   The 7,200-strong force has long been renowned for its ferocity,
but the recent gang-like attacks have prompted cries for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights activists say the violent behavior is condoned by
Border Police commanders. ''It's a policy of closing one's eyes,''
said Yael Stein of the Betselem human rights group.
</P>
<P>
   Border Police spokesman Peretz Ratzon said cases of brutality
are exceptions, noting 47 complaints in the past nine years. But
human rights activists believe many cases go unreported.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the growing criticism prompted the unit to bring 300 of
its top officers together with Palestinians and human rights
experts this week in an effort to get to the root of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of them are only 18-years-old, and we ask them to enforce
the law,'' said Deputy Commissioner Moshe Karadi, who is in charge
of training and who organized Wednesday's conference. ''Some of
them have not achieved the necessary maturity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Border Police was established as an arm of the police soon
after the state's establishment in 1948 to deal with perceived
threats of insurgency from Israel's Arab minority.
</P>
<P>
   In later years, the force largely dealt with quelling
Palestinian riots and enforcing Israeli closures of the West Bank
and Gaza Strip which kept Palestinians from entering Israel.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1987-93 Palestinian uprising, border policemen would
often wade into riots armed with clubs, fists and handcuffs,
deliberately leaving their firearms behind.
</P>
<P>
   It was a contrast with the regular army, where troops -- largely
untrained in dealing with civilians -- were prone to use guns.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the army's crack infantry units, which made stamina and
intelligence their criteria for recruits, border policemen were
chosen mostly for their brawn.
</P>
<P>
   That may be behind the recent cases of brutality, human rights
activists say.
</P>
<P>
   On the night of Sept. 5, three border policemen stopped a car
near Jerusalem and ordered out three Palestinian supermarket
employees. The three say they did not resist.
</P>
<P>
   The policemen beat them so severely they had to be hospitalized
and -- in an act that made headlines because of its sheer brazenness
-- they posed for trophy photos. Police arresting the three border
policemen found the film intact in the camera. They have been
jailed pending trial.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact they took photos just shows how acceptable it is,''
said Stein, the human rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   The most recent incident was on Monday, when a group of
Palestinian hotel employees winding down with a soccer game after
their shifts say they were ordered off the field by off-duty border
policemen who wanted to play their own game.
</P>
<P>
   Muhammad Abu-Elhawa, a room service waiter at the luxury Laromme
Hotel, said he politely asked the policemen -- some in uniform,
others not -- to wait 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That prompted one of the policemen to call in reinforcements --
about 30 altogether, Abu-Elhawa said. They beat the Palestinians,
some using gun butts. The police fled when one Palestinian alerted
an ambulance.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Elhawa said he sustained blows when he tried to protect a
friend who was beaten senseless after reaching for a cellphone.
Abu-Elhawa got X-rays Thursday to see if the blows caused
fractures.
</P>
<P>
   He had no hard feelings toward Israelis -- his bosses at the
hotel, shocked by the tale, alerted the media and helped find a
lawyer to make sure the assailants are tried.
</P>
<P>
   Abu-Elhawa said he and his colleagues hardly posed a threat to
anyone. ''We were in shorts and T-shirts, we meant no one any
harm,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The border police troops say the Palestinians started the fight.
Police are investigating both complaints.
</P>
<P>
   One problem, Deputy Commissioner Karadi said, was that the
commanders in the field failed to reinforce respect for democratic
values emphasized during training. This week's conference of senior
commanders -- a first -- was a step in that direction.
</P>
<P>
   At the conference, several border policemen complained they are
sometimes the target of unfair criticism, by the media and by
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (the police) didn't understand that the other side is not
the problem,'' said Amira Perlov of the tolerance-promoting Van
Leer Institute.

<HEADLINE> Sen. Drops Diplomat Nominee Holds  </HEADLINE>
By FREDERIC J. FROMMER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A senator dropped his hold on seven
ambassadorial nominees, who had piled up about 100 security
violations, after the State Department agreed to tighten its
disciplinary procedures.
</P>
<P>
   ''I applaud them for it,'' said Minnesota Republican Rod Grams,
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee on
international operations. ''The concerns that I've raised have been
addressed.''
</P>
<P>
   The nominees, who have not been identified, will be considered
in a closed hearing of the full committee next Wednesday. By
tradition, senators are frequently allowed to delay the
confirmation of nominees to whom they have objections.
</P>
<P>
   Grams said the committee will probably approve all seven career
foreign service officers, although he said there was one nominee he
still had reservations about. One of the nominees had accumulated
more than 20 security violations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the changes to be adopted by the State Department,
effective next month:
</P>
<P>
   --All ''security incidents'' will be reported immediately to
Washington, and will stay on the employee's record after switching
posts.
</P>
<P>
   --Two infractions will trigger a warning letter, down from four;
and three infractions will trigger a disciplinary process, down
from five.
</P>
<P>
   --The State Department's nominations committee will take security
records into account when it selects ambassadorial nominees.
</P>
<P>
   --Security records will be included in an employee's performance
evaluation.
</P>
<P>
   The security violations reportedly include leaving safes open
and taking classified documents from embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department confirmed the changes were made in response
to Grams' holds.
</P>
<P>
   ''The administration should never put us in this position of
sending up people that had these types of violations on their
records,'' Grams said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ray: Whitewater Findings Release OK  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Independent Counsel Robert Ray said a
Democratic senator is incorrect in criticizing Ray's public release
of findings in the Whitewater investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Ray's public airing of his
conclusions was unfair. Levin said they should be submitted under
seal to a federal appeals court when the prosecutor files a final
report in the Whitewater probe.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is nothing illegal, unfair or inappropriate about our
statement,'' said Ray, who found Wednesday that there was
insufficient evidence to prove that either President Clinton or his
wife committed a crime in the Whitewater scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Ray said the Independent Counsel statute was rewritten six years
ago to allow for a public explanation of a prosecutor's decision
not to indict someone.

<HEADLINE> Bill overturning Supreme Court lesbian custody ruling stalls in Assembly </HEADLINE>
By KATHLEEN CANNON
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - State lawmakers Thursday balked at
supporting a bill designed to thwart a New Jersey Supreme Court
decision that deemed a lesbian a legal co-parent to the children of
her ex-partner.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would strip custody or visitation rights from most
people who have no blood or adoption ties to a child.
</P>
<P>
   But the sponsor, Assemblywoman Marion Crecco, R-Essex, held the
bill from consideration when it became apparent that she did not
have sufficient support in the Assembly Senior Issues and Community
Services committee.
</P>
<P>
   The natural mother of the children in the state Supreme Court
case, who goes by the initials M.J.B., testified that her
5-year-old twins suffer psychological problems as a result of
court-ordered visitation with her ex-partner, who is identified in
court documents as V.C.
</P>
<P>
   The justices in April granted V.C. visitation rights, but denied
her custody of the children in a ruling gay activists applauded for
recognizing the ex-partner as a legal co-parent.
</P>
<P>
   M.J.B. has since appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Crecco said she introduced the bill to protect children from the
demands of intrusive non-family members who have only fleeting
relationships with the true parents.
</P>
<P>
   ''Parental rights are being eroded and it's time it's stopped,''
Crecco said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The potential for a flood of custody and visitation suits from
ex-boyfriends and girlfriends exists and is terribly frightening,''
M.J.B. told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   ''We now need laws to make sure that just living with a kid for
a few months does not entitle an adult to force themselves into
that child's life forever,'' said the mother, an Atlantic County
resident.
</P>
<P>
   She told the committee that police were called to her house
earlier this month to escort her children to V.C.'s for a weekend
visit. The twins, one girl, one boy, were traumatized, she said.
M.J.B.'s new companion took photographs of police entering her
home, copies of which she brought to the committee meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But committee members said Crecco's bill could backfire by
cutting ties between loving adults and children with whom they
bonded and helped raise.
</P>
<P>
   ''This bill would tie the hands of the courts,'' said
Assemblywoman Charlotte Vandervalk, R-Bergen. ''In this day and
age, we have to look at what's best for the children.''
</P>
<P>
   The American Civil Liberties Union also opposed the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ''The courts have recognized that a child develops a strong bond
with the people who raise him, regardless of their legal status,''
said ACLU staff attorney Leslie Cooper. The courts have set a high
legal standard for people to meet to be awarded parental status,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Any fears about nannies, or boyfriends or girlfriends getting
custody is unwarranted,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   After other committee members also expressed reservations about
the bill, committee Chairman Melvin Cottrell, R-Ocean, warned
Crecco that she lacked the votes to send the bill to the full
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Crecco said she might try again with a different committee.
</P>
<P>
   But Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, who controls bill committee
assignments, later said there was little chance he would grant
Crecco's wish.

<HEADLINE> Hindu Prayer in Congress Criticized  </HEADLINE>
By JIM ABRAMS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A major conservative group is complaining that
an invitation to a Hindu priest to give the prayer at the opening
of a House session is another indication of the nation drifting
from its Judeo-Christian roots.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our founders expected that Christianity -- and no other
religion -- would receive support from the government as long as
that support did not violate peoples' consciences and their right
to worship,'' said the Family Research Council, a leading advocacy
group for conservative causes.
</P>
<P>
   ''They would have found utterly incredible the idea that all
religions, including paganism, be treated with equal deference,''
the group said in a comment posted on its Web page.
</P>
<P>
   Last Thursday, a Hindu priest from Parma, Ohio, delivered the
opening prayer to the House in conjunction with Indian Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee addressing a joint meeting of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of Rep. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, Venkatachalapathi
Samuldrala was the first Hindu ever to give the House invocation.
</P>
<P>
   ''As for our Hindu priest friend, the United States is a nation
that has historically honored the One True God,'' the council said.
''Woe be to us on that day when we relegate Him to being merely one
among countless other deities in the pantheon of theologies.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Barry W. Lynn, executive director of Americans United
for Separation of Church and State, a religious liberty watchdog
group, said the statement ''reeks of religious bigotry'' and shows
a ''remarkable lack of respect for religious diversity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bridget Fisher, spokeswoman for Rep. Brown, noted that there are
1.4 million Indian-Americans in the country and it is ''unfortunate
that the Family Research Council interprets the Constitution to say
that religious freedom means Christian supremacy.''
</P>
<P>
   The House has a full-time chaplain, currently a Roman Catholic
priest, but on occasion invites guest religious leaders to deliver
the opening prayer. Last week, in another first, the prayer was
given by a Roman Catholic nun.

<HEADLINE> Whitman says no to off-track betting  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A proposal to allow off-track betting was
dealt a serious setback Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman vetoed a bill that would have allowed
racetrack owners, including the state sports authority, to open up
to 15 off-track betting parlors around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The bill would have also allowed gamblers to set up accounts at
racetracks so they could bet by phone or over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Included in the measure was the state's own sports authority,
which operates the Meadowlands racetrack and Monmouth Park.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters contended off-track betting would boost New Jersey's
flagging horse racing industry.
</P>
<P>
   In her veto message to the Legislature, Whitman said she
supports off-track betting, but wants changes in the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's version of the regulations would allow OTB parlors to
operate more efficiently, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The measure passed by the Legislature gives 40 percent of the
money bet to purses - or prize money - for owners of winning
horses, with the authority getting 60 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman, who earlier said the purse should be 36 percent, agreed
with the Legislature's higher figure. The current legal split is 33
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Garland, senior executive vice president of racing for the
New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority, said the changes
Whitman wants make sense.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our position is New Jersey needs this legislation. We concur
with the governor. She has crafted an excellent compromise. New
Jersey needs to improve its competitive position. It's time to all
work together to address this issue as well as others that confront
us,'' Garland said.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly approved the bill with a 66-13 vote on June 29; the
Senate margin that day was 27-11. Last year, the Senate passed a
version of the bill, but the Assembly did not act on it.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought the bill that passed overwhelmingly in both houses
after a great deal of deliberation, not just in the short term, but
it's been out there for two years,'' Assembly Speaker Jack Collins,
R-Salem, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40,000 people work in the horse-racing industry in New
Jersey, and the state needs to protect those interests as well as
agriculture and open-space concerns, Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe we need to do something to keep horse racing in the
state of New Jersey, and horse racing to me is not just the two
minutes they run around the track, but also all the extras,''
Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   Off-track betting and phone wagering make it easier for people
to bet on horse races. That pumps more money into the industry.
Some of that money goes into making bigger purses, which eventually
attract better horses and more fans.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, there were 163 live thoroughbred racing days - 141
fewer than in 1992. With fatter purses and more fans, harness
racing fares better. It had 395 live harness racing days in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   From 1993 to 1997, annual attendance at New Jersey's tracks
declined from 3.87 million to 2.87 million. The amount wagered also
declined sharply from about $831 million to $467 million, according
to the New Jersey Racing Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Racetrack operators would be required to run a minimum number of
live racing days to keep their OTB permits. The bills also require
the state to meet local zoning laws, pay property taxes and obtain
a local liquor license.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1998, voters approved a referendum that allowed the
state to change the rules governing horse racing. Officials said
the move would preserve horse racing, open space and jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But thoroughbred owners faced off against the sports authority,
charging that the original measure was designed to pump money into
the authority, not the horse racing industry.

<HEADLINE> 71-year-old grandmother forges ahead for seat in Congress  </HEADLINE>
By PAT MILTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLPORT, N.Y. (AP) - Reggie Seltzer has been on the go since
squeaking out a victory in a Long Island Democratic primary vote
recount this week. There is no time to waste with only seven weeks
to go until election day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are racing against the clock,'' said Seltzer, her blue
shirt sleeves rolled up to her elbows as she paused to talk in the
backyard of her waterfront home.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm the underdog,'' she says. ''It's going to be an uphill
fight. But the decks were stacked against me in the primary and we
won.''
</P>
<P>
   The 71-year-old environmental lawyer was declared the winner by
35 votes on Monday, beating out two-term Congressman Michael Forbes
who had switched from the Republican Party to the Democratic Party
last year.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer now faces Republican Felix Grucci, Supervisor of the
Town of Brookhaven, in November.
</P>
<P>
   Grucci is considered a more formidable opponent than Forbes. He
has a highly recognized name, being a son of the world famous
Grucci fireworks family. He is also expected to spend more than $1
million on the campaign buttressed with funds from the National
Republican Committee who are paying close attention to the Long
Island district.
</P>
<P>
   Registered Republicans in the Suffolk County district outnumber
Democrats by a 2-to1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   Grucci is not shifting his campaign strategy for Seltzer, says
Howard Martini, Grucci's senior adviser and former Suffolk GOP
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   ''Felix Grucci is going to campaign on his record,'' says
Martini. ''That doesn't change because there is a different
candidate in the race. The difference between Forbes and Seltzer is
that Forbes abandoned his principles, and Reggie Seltzer has the
wrong principles.''
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer points to the environment as one of the most important
issue in the district, and the one in which she and Grucci differ
the most.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Grucci has not met a developer he does not like,'' Seltzer
said. She charged Grucci with turning the district into the
''strip-mall capital of Long Island'' in his role as Brookhaven
supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   ''There has to be a balance between jobs and the environment,''
Seltzer said. Some of the development decisions under Grucci's
leadership have not only damaged the environment but threaten the
area's tourism-driven economy,'' she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Grucci counters that criticism by saying that he was the driving
force behind the purchase of 500,000 acres of open space in
Brookhaven Township and the passing of a $10 million bond act to
preserve open space and drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   Seltzer, a self-assured grandmother, says she can't wait to
debate Grucci face to face.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile she continues to run a traditional grass-roots
campaign out of her kitchen.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Reportedly OKs Land Swap  </HEADLINE>
By MARK LAVIE
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is willing to
trade land in the West Bank for territory in Israel, a swap aiming
to accommodate Jewish settlers, an American Jewish leader who met
with him said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Israel and the Palestinians are waiting for the United States to
decide whether to offer bridging proposals to break the logjam in
their negotiations, officials from both sides said.
</P>
<P>
   The talks are deadlocked over control of holy sites in
Jerusalem, though other key issues, including Palestinian refugees,
Jewish settlements and borders, have not been resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat is committed to reaching an agreement, but ''hasn't
decided on what to sign, when to sign,'' said Abraham Foxman,
national director of the Anti-Defamation League, an American Jewish
group, who met with Arafat late Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   New ideas raised by Arafat included solving the plight of
Palestinian refugees in Lebanon first, because unlike in other
countries, refugees in Lebanon are not allowed to work, Foxman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Arafat expressed willingness to grant Israel some
territory in the West Bank claimed by the Palestinians in return
for territory now within the borders of Israel. Some Israeli
officials have put forawrd the swap idea to allow Israel to keep
some of its settlements in the West Bank. Arafat also expressed
willingness to post an international peace force in the Jordan
Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat told President Clinton in a meeting in New York earlier
this month that the parcels of land traded should be equal in size,
and that the Palestinians would not give up areas above aquifers or
populated regions, according to Palestinian officials.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has sent conflicting messages. Acting Foreign Minister
Shlomo Ben-Ami has ruled out land swaps, while Israeli negotiators
said during the Mideast summit at Camp David in July they want to
take 9 percent of the West Bank for 1 percent of Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians want a freeze in settlement activity pending an
agreement. On Thursday, an army spokesman confirmed that the
Defense Ministry has approved the 250-acre expansion of the Alfei
Menasheh settlement in the West Bank. Bulldozers have begun
clearing the land in preparation for construction, Capt. Peter
Lerner said.
</P>
<P>
   Ben-Ami said he was worried Americans may not present a summary
document of recent talks if they cannot narrow the wide gaps.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not totally sure that a document will be issued,'' Ben-Ami
told Channel One television. ''If it becomes clear to them that ...
they can't put together a package that can bring the positions of
the two sides together, maybe they won't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foxman said that in Wednesday's meeting, Arafat tried to show
that the Palestinians are flexible, but that Israel is raising
obstacles. ''It was a whole conversation of things that are
doable,'' Foxman said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Arafat showed no willingness to compromise over
Jerusalem, but referred to Jewish feelings for the holy sites
there. Arafat has not acknowledged that the biblical Jewish Temples
stood on the site where an Islamic shrine and mosque are located
now.
</P>
<P>
   The top Palestinian official in east Jerusalem, Faisel Husseini,
warned Thursday that the Palestinians will fight an Israeli plan to
build a superhighway through the disputed sector of the city. City
hall has begun issuing evacuation orders to Palestinians living in
the path of the planned road.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Israeli decision that comes at this time, during
negotiations, shows how much Israel is hesitating in the peace
process,'' Husseini said after a special meeting of a Jerusalem
committee called by Arafat. ''I think that there will be a serious
reaction ... on this decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Though no progress has been made toward a peace accord since the
Camp David, Israel and the Palestinians concluded an agreement late
Wednesday on the construction of a seaport in Gaza, after Israeli
security and environmental concerns were cleared up in drawn-out
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Israel had consented to a port in several previous agreements
with the Palestinians, but repeatedly withheld the final go-ahead.
The port is to be ready in 18 months.

<HEADLINE> Energy Dept. Posts Weapons Site List  </HEADLINE>
By NANCY ZUCKERBROD
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Energy Department posted a list on its Web
site Thursday of more than 500 government and commercial sites
across the country that may have been used to help build nuclear
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The department created the list in 1995, when the agency was
trying to determine sites for an environmental cleanup program. The
list is identified as a working document subject to revision.
</P>
<P>
   That specific cleanup program has since been moved to the Army
Corps of Engineers, but the Energy Department does clean up sites.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the department is reviewing the list to see which
sites need to be cleaned up.
</P>
<P>
   The list documents weapons activity that took place as early as
the 1940s, when the government was building the first atomic bomb.
Some small, private businesses secretly participated in the effort
known as the Manhattan Project.
</P>
<P>
   File and field reviews of the sites on the list began in the
early 1970s, when government officials realized the sites should be
evaluated to determine the risks posed to workers and the
environment.
</P>
<P>
   The department still is trying to sort out which sites need to
be cleaned up, according Carolyn Huntoon, who oversees cleanup
issues for the department.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are reconstructing the history of these former and present
sites to see if questions remain about contamination,'' Huntoon
said. '' ... In the near future, we expect to have a more thorough
and comprehensive list and a plan for addressing health and
environmental concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said earlier this month he
wanted to publicize the list. Huntoon said the agency did not want
to delay posting it any longer ''in an effort to be candid with
workers.''

<HEADLINE> Bill to ban police ticket quotas moves in Assembly  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A bill to prevent police departments from
using ticket quotas now goes to the full Assembly for a vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Law and Public Safety Committee of the lower house
unanimously approved the measure Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Ticket quotas are an invitation to overzealousness and
carelessness. They are a cancer that can breed contempt among
police officers and distrust with the general public,'' bill
sponsor Assemblyman Herbert Conaway, D-Burlington, said in a
statement.
</P>
<P>
   A version of the bill passed the Senate 38-0 on June 29. That
measure does not forbid police supervisors from using tickets or
arrest statistics as one way to judge an officer's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Conaway's bill, however, would prevent a police officer's
performance evaluation from being based solely on the number of
tickets written.
</P>
<P>
   The State Policemen's Benevolent Association and the Fraternal
Order of Police, two of the state's biggest police unions, support
his bill, A-2261, Conaway said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Law enforcement officials are not salesmen,'' Conaway said.
''Traffic ticket quotas can divert their attention away from other
more pressing aspects of police work.''

<HEADLINE> Fashion Week Heads to Finish Line  </HEADLINE>
By FRANCINE PARNES
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- With Fashion Week wrapping up, the Halston line
unveiled a slew of shirtdresses and separates in a reminder of why
designer Craig Natiello is acclaimed for his evening wear.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halston Frowick died in 1990, yet under Natiello the line
still had the late designer's successful signature touches, such as
Ultrasuede. This time, the suede-like fabric was fashioned into
those trendy shirtdresses, as well as cropped jean jackets and
animal-print suits.
</P>
<P>
   Natiello, in his second season running the line, sent out
additional Halstonisms, most notably long and lean slinky gowns
which rise high on the thigh. There were enough gold sequins to
inspire the designer to name a T-shirt dress ''Fort Knox.'' Gold
lace blanketed everything from turtlenecks to wrap dresses -- and
there were splashes of sequins.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really the snottiness of taking a shirtdress and beading
it,'' said Natiello, who has dressed Sharon Stone and Geena Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In its first Fashion Week show since Bill Blass stepped down
from the helm, his namesake design house introduced a new head
designer and a new look.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Slowick stayed true in part to the Blass course, sending
out familiar signatures, most notably menswear fabrics like
pinstripes and houndstooth, and tweed splattered with sequins.
</P>
<P>
   ''First, I talked with Mr. Blass and literally interviewed him,
and we discussed the spirit of Bill Blass,'' Slowick said after the
show. ''I wanted to integrate that with my own touch.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, Geoffrey Beene offered a still-life presentation of
his spring line on mannequins.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is full of perennial Beene favorites, which
illustrate his unusual use of color and cut. A two-toned gown is
solid black on one side, and striped in black and white on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The line also showcases Beene trademarks such as black jersey
gowns with cutouts, and cropped, simple boleros. Beene also
reprised his imaginative gloves, this time in polka dots and
fanciful colors.
</P>
<P>
   New York designer Anna Sui packed the house Wednesday night with
a lineup of '80s punk-inspired black dresses slashed to pieces and
accessorized with fishnet hosiery and mile-high spike heels.
Fingerless gloves suggested Madonna in her earlier days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sui nodded to trends of the moment, offering safari
jackets, pleated skirts and off-the shoulder dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Week wraps up Friday with Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.

<HEADLINE> Ross indicted in 1982 murder in New York  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIDDLETOWN, N.Y. (AP) - Serial killer Michael Ross, on death row
for the murders of four teen-age girls in Connecticut in the early
1980s, has been indicted in an 18-year-old murder in New York.
</P>
<P>
   DNA evidence links Ross to the rape and murder of Paula Perrara,
a high school student who disappeared from Wallkill, N.Y. in March,
1982, prosecutors said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Michael Ross picked her up, drove her to a secluded area,
dragged her from his car, raped her and murdered her,'' said Frank
Phillips, the district attorney for Orange County.
</P>
<P>
   Ross was a student at Cornell University at the time.
</P>
<P>
   Police in New York linked Ross to the case after he admitted in
a BBC interview that he had committed at least one murder in New
York that had not been linked to him. New York police got a search
warrant and collected DNA samples from Ross - which matched those
found on Perrara.
</P>
<P>
   Ross has previously confessed to two other murders in New York,
but has never been tried in those cases.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Ross was resentenced to death in the murders of four
Connecticut women. Ross admitted preying on his victims as they
walked or hitchhiked down quiet country roads in New London County.
He raped some of them. Ross also is serving two life sentences for
killing two other women in Windham County.
</P>
<P>
   Ross, 40, was convicted of the slayings and sentenced to death
in 1987, but the state Supreme Court in 1994 overturned the
penalty. The high court ruled that information was withheld from
the defense that might have helped Ross get life in prison and
ordered a new penalty hearing.
</P>
<P>
   During that hearing, Ross claimed a disorder called sexual
sadism drove him to rape and kill - a defense the jury rejected.

<HEADLINE> With BC-NJ--Casino Tunnel, 1st Ld-Writethru,520  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) - It's no mirage: The first new casino
here in more than 10 years is under construction.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Gaming Corp. officials held ceremonies Thursday night for
The Borgata, a 2,010-room mega-resort in the marina district that
will take three years to build.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've moved 800,000 cubic yards of dirt here already,'' said
Robert Boughner, CEO of the Borgata. ''It would be disingenuous to
call this a groundbreaking.''
</P>
<P>
   About 400 casino officials, community leaders and guests
attended a lavish invitation only soiree under a tent at the site.
Among them was Gov. Christie Whitman, who said she was relieved to
finally see some development in Atlantic City's marina district.
</P>
<P>
   The $1 billion project represents the first ripple of a
long-awaited ''second wave'' of casino development that was
promised in 1996, when Mirage Resorts Inc., MGM Grand Inc. and Boyd
Gaming all announced plans to build Las Vegas-style casino resorts.
</P>
<P>
   All but Boyd's project, however, have crapped out.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by delays in land acquisition, MGM Grand's plan for a
Boardwalk fizzled. Mirage Resorts Inc., which had triggered a gold
rush by Las Vegas operators when it announced plans for a $1
billion project here, sold out to Mirage this year.
</P>
<P>
   The new company, MGM Mirage, may still forge ahead with Mirage's
planned Le Jardin casino. But for now, The Borgata - a joint
venture of Boyd Gaming and MGM Mirage - looks like the only sure
thing.
</P>
<P>
   When completed, the 40-story tower will be Atlantic City's
biggest casino hotel and the first new one to open since Trump Taj
Mahal in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Gaming President Donald Snyder said Thursday the company is
even more bullish on Atlantic City than it was four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''When you look at the steady growth of this market in the face
of tremendous competition from Connecticut and other places, it
speaks to the resiliency of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Situated on a 30-acre site near Trump Marina and Harrah's
Atlantic City, it will also be the first to benefit from the $330
million Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, a 2.2-mile
road-and-tunnel link between the foot of the Atlantic City
Expressway and the marina district.
</P>
<P>
   City officials are grateful to finally have something to show
for the controversy surrounding the tunnel project and the other
on-again, off-again projects.
</P>
<P>
   ''At one point, it looked like there might be two or three major
mega-resorts being built at the same time,'' said Mayor James
Whelan.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would've welcomed that. But now, they'll be better spaced,
which isn't the worst thing in the world either. The construction
workers in this area are happy about it stretching over eight years
instead of having to import labor from everywhere on the East
Coast, which is what they would have had to do if everybody built
at once.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd Gaming, based in Las Vegas, owns or operates 11 casinos in
Nevada, Mississippi, Illinois, Indiana and Louisiana.

<HEADLINE> USDA Seen Lacking Staff for Probes  </HEADLINE>
By PHILIP BRASHER
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government agency that investigates
anticompetitive behavior in cattle and hog markets lacks the
training and legal expertise to do the job, congressional auditors
say.
</P>
<P>
   The Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration,
part of the Agriculture Department, is ''better positioned for
performing economic analyses'' than for developing cases to prove
that ''anticompetitive practices have occurred,'' according to a
report by the General Accounting Office.
</P>
<P>
   USDA could learn from the agencies that enforce antitrust laws
in other areas of the economy -- the Justice Department and the
Federal Trade Commission -- and use teams of attorneys and
economists to conduct investigations, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The GAO is the investigative arm of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department has come under criticism from farmers
and ranchers who don't think the agency has done enough to curb the
power of large meatpackers.
</P>
<P>
   The department ''has been ineffective at addressing growing
concerns about competition in the livestock market and because of
the agency's shortcoming, potential violations may not have been
pursued,'' said Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa. USDA hasn't used the
money Congress has given it effectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The packers and stockyards administration relies on its staff of
18 economists to investigate complaints about cattle and hog
markets, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The department's general counsel assigns some of its lawyers to
help investigate the cases, but the number of attorneys has been
cut from eight to five because of budget constraints.
</P>
<P>
   From Oct. 1, 1997, through the end of 1999, the department
opened 74 investigations involving cattle or hog markets. As of
March 57 had been completed, and violations were found in five of
those, the GAO said.
</P>
<P>
   USDA ''will be looking very seriously'' at the report's
recommendations, said Susan McAvoy, a spokeswoman for Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are aggressively working to ensure fair competition in the
industry,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Meat Institute, which represents major meatpackers,
issued a statement saying that the industry ''supports continuous
education'' within USDA ''to understand our industry's rapidly
evolving business practices.

<HEADLINE> Iran Test-Fires Missile  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran has successfully test-fired its first
solid-liquid fuel missile, which the defense minister said was part
of a program for launching satellites, the state news agency said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Defense Minister Vice Adm. Ali Shamkhani said the missile, the
Shahab-3D, would be used for nonmilitary purposes, the Islamic
Republic News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
   Shamkhani was quoted saying the missile was built by the
national aerospace authority as part of a program for building
rockets to launch satellites. He insisted Iran did not produce
offensive weapons, the agency added. He did not give the rocket's
range or other details.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, however, a senior Clinton administration official
said that while Iran did conduct a test, it was not successful. The
official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, gave no details.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, a U.S. intelligence official, Robert D. Walpole, cast
doubt on the success of the launch during testimony to a Senate
subcommittee hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ''They say it's successful. We're analyzing the data from the
launch and we will tell you more ... but be careful when you get
public announcements like this,'' said Walpole, of the National
Intelligence Council, a group of officials from major U.S.
intelligence organizations that advises the director of the CIA.
</P>
<P>
   ''It (the announcement) says it's for non-military purposes -- we
view it as a missile, not a space launch vehicle,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Iran has built and tested a number of missiles, including the
Shahab-3 which has a range of 810 miles. Washington denounced a
July test of the Shahab-3, which it said could reach Israel or U.S.
troops in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
   ''We regard their aggressive efforts to develop missile
capability as a serious threat,'' a State Department deputy
spokesman, Philip Reeker, said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Pataki says he is opposed to a Yankees move to Manhattan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - Gov. George Pataki said Thursday that he will
not back a move by the Yankees to Manhattan's west side, and said
any move to the city by the Jets would have to be beneficial to the
public and not just to private interests.
</P>
<P>
   For the past several days, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has spoken
about the need for a stadium with a retractible roof on Manhattan
property owned by the state's Metropolitan Transportation Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said the facility could be used by the Jets or Yankees,
as well as for conventions and the 2012 Olympics, which the city is
pushing for. In recent days, the mayor has met with officials from
the Jets about the stadium proposal.
</P>
<P>
   A new stadium would likely not be built without the governor's
support.
</P>
<P>
   While Pataki said Thursday that he was open-minded about the $1
billion stadium, he ruled out a move by the Yankees and threw cold
water on a Jets move.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let me make it plain, if the idea is to move the Yankees from
the Bronx, I will oppose it strenuously,'' Pataki said at a
Manhattan news conference. ''It cannot be any part of this
proposal.''
</P>
<P>
   The stadium has aroused significant opposition from the area's
political leaders due to concerns about noise and traffic. Pataki
said during a call-in show on WCBS radio that the stadium ''has to
be in the public interest...Not just in the private interest.''
</P>
<P>
   One alternative, Pataki said, is to build a stadium for the Jets
near Shea Stadium in Queens.

<HEADLINE> Senate passes home improvement registration bill  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Legislation backed by Gov. Christie Whitman
that would force home improvement contractors to register with the
state passed the Senate on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, S-831, passed 29-7 and now heads to the Assembly for
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would require all home improvement contractors to
register with the state or county in which they work.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would also establish fines to punish unscrupulous
contractors who commit consumer fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Violators would be subject to fines up to $7,500 for a first
offense, and $15,000 for second or subsequent offenses, under the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said in a statement after the Senate vote that the bill
will provide much-needed protections for New Jersey residents,
especially vulnerable senior citizens, who hire home improvement
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   Each year, more than 50,000 state residents report they've been
the victim of a home repair rip-off, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Without the law, ''Essentially, anyone with a business card,
truck and tools can claim to be a home improvement contractor,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, the threat of prosecution is not enough to deter
these bad apples, and we must now go a step further,'' she said.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The Senate on Thursday approved a plan to
increase the legal age to buy handguns in New Jersey to 21.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous vote is aimed at eliminating a conflict between
New Jersey's regulations and federal law, bill sponsors said.
</P>
<P>
   The current legal age to buy a handgun is 18. The bill passed
Thursday provides exemptions for law enforcement officials who are
under 21 but have been trained in using firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone under the proposed legal age who carried a handgun would
face up to 18 months in prison and fines of $10,000 under the bill,
S-2047.
</P>
<P>
   A similar measure passed the Assembly on June 26 by a vote of
70-7 and cleared the Senate 38-0 on May 18.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - As Fashion Week headed towards the home stretch
Thursday, the Halston line returned for its second season under
designer Craig Natiello, with a slew of shirtdresses and separates,
reminding the audience why Halston was acclaimed for his evening
wear in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Roy Halston Frowick died in 1990, yet under Natiello, the line
continues with the late designer's successful signature touches,
such as Ultrasuede. This time the suede-like fabric was fashioned
into trendy shirtdresses, cropped jean jackets and animal-print
suits.
</P>
<P>
   Natiello sent out additional Halstonisms, most notably long and
lean slinky gowns which rise high on the thigh. There were enough
gold sequins to inspire the designer to name a T-shirt dress ''Fort
Knox.'' Gold lace blanketed everything from turtlenecks to wrap
dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Natiello advanced the Halston idea of casual looks, dressed up
for evening, such as shirtdresses, splashed all over with sequins.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really the snottiness of taking a shirtdress and beading
it,'' said Natiello, who has dressed Sharon Stone and Geena Davis.
</P>
<P>
   In its first Fashion Week show since Bill Blass stepped down
from the helm, his namesake design house introduced a new head
designer and a new look.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Slowick stayed true in part to the Blass course, sending
out familiar signatures, most notably menswear fabrics like
pinstripes and houndstooth, and tweed splattered with sequins.
Still, the Slowick spin was evident throughout.
</P>
<P>
   ''First I talked with Mr. Blass and literally interviewed him,
and we discussed the spirit of Bill Blass,'' said Slowick, behind
the curtain in the post-show crunch. ''I wanted to integrate that
with my own touch.''
</P>
<P>
   His challenge will be to keep the Blass loyals while attracting
a wider customer base.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere on the Fashion Week circuit, Geoffrey Beene offered a
still-life presentation of his spring line on mannequins.
</P>
<P>
   The collection is full of perennial Beene favorites, which
illustrate his unusual use of color and cut. A two-toned gown is
solid black on one side, and striped in black and white on the
other.
</P>
<P>
   The line also showcases Beene trademarks such as black jersey
gowns with cutouts, and cropped, simple boleros. Beene also
reprised his imaginative gloves, this time in polka dots and
fanciful colors.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday night starred Anna Sui, the New York designer who
packed the house with a crush of young faces, there to glimpse her
lineup of '80s punk-inspired black dresses slashed to pieces and
accessorized with fishnet hosiery and mile-high spike heels.
Fingerless gloves suggested Madonna in her earlier days.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sui nodded to trends of the moment such as safari
jackets, pleated skirts and off-the shoulder dresses.
</P>
<P>
   Fashion Week wraps up Friday with Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Steps Up Anti-West Talk  </HEADLINE>
By JOVANA GEC
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Trailing in polls days before key
elections, President Slobodan Milosevic's allies turned up their
anti-Western propaganda campaign Thursday, claiming plots have been
crafted abroad to bring the opposition to power in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Yugoslavia's prime minister, meanwhile, said Milosevic would
remain in office until the middle of next year even if he loses
Sunday's vote because the constitution allows him to finish his
current term, which expires in June.
</P>
<P>
   The comment, made by Prime Minister Momir Bulatovic to a private
television station in Montenegro, was the clearest public sign so
far that Milosevic will hang on to power regardless of the outcome
of Sunday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ''I absolutely believe President Milosevic will win the
election,'' Bulatovic said. ''No matter, the president's mandate
expires next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts dispute Bulatovic's interpretation, noting the
constitution also calls for a new president to be sworn in within
15 days of the election. Under previous rules, Milosevic was named
by parliament in 1997 for a four-year term. But this year he
changed the constitution to allow for direct elections and called
an early ballot.
</P>
<P>
   Bulatovic's comments followed a day of increasingly
confrontational rhetoric, in which a top Yugoslav army commander
even claimed the West's plans may include infiltration of his
troops during Sunday's elections.
</P>
<P>
   Such conspiracy theories have been spun for weeks by government
officials, leading to fears that they were preparing ground for the
possible annulment of the presidential, parliamentary and municipal
elections if Milosevic loses -- and force, if needed, against
opposition supporters.
</P>
<P>
   The army chief of staff, Gen. Nebojsa Pavkovic, recently
described the elections as ''D-Day'' for the army. On Thursday, he
softened his customary all-out support for Milosevic by saying the
military would recognize a victory by opposition candidate Vojislav
Kostunica.
</P>
<P>
   But opposition supporters fear that is empty rhetoric, because --
by declaring that any opposition win is in reality an
anti-government coup -- authorities have ruled out recognizing a
defeat of Milosevic and his party in the presidential and
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic is shown trailing Kostunica in all polls published
here ahead of the elections. The incumbent's popularity plummeted
after last year's NATO bombing, which led to Milosevic's giving up
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's key aide, Nikola Sainovic, said Thursday that a
NATO-led campaign to remove Milosevic from power by force is at
work in Western capitals.
</P>
<P>
   ''They (NATO and opposition) have created a whole structure and
organization, and they are making such a fuss that it all became
clear,'' said Sainovic, referring to growing optimism among
pro-democracy Serbs about an election victory.
</P>
<P>
   The pro-Western president of Montenegro, the republic that along
with Serbia makes up Yugoslavia, warned Thursday that Milosevic
would use force to stay in powe.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't expect Milosevic will ever concede losing the
ballot,'' Milo Djukanovic told The Associated Press. ''What's more,
I am convinced that he will -- if need be -- use force.''
</P>
<P>
   Chief of Staff Pavkovic, speaking on Montenegro's state TV,
warned that foreign soldiers might try to move into Yugoslavia
during elections and that his troops would be ready.
</P>
<P>
   ''As a serious army we have to be ready to prevent any
surprises,'' Pavkovic said. ''If someone intervenes, there won't be
peace.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Tanjug the military will ''defend the country's freedom
... and a country cannot be free if it is colonized and enslaved.''
</P>
<P>
   Independent analysts also predict that Milosevic will try to rig
the vote in his favor. An independent election monitoring group
claimed Thursday that it has come into possession of ballots with
Milosevic's name already circled.
</P>
<P>
   ''He has so much to lose,'' Gen. Wesley Clark, NATO's former
supreme allied commander, Europe, said of Milosevic. ''We have to
anticipate anything that he will do to stay in power.''
</P>
<P>
   Very few visas have been granted to Western journalists, and
even nationals of the few countries who don't need visas but work
for Western news organizations have been told they cannot enter the
country without a special letter of authorization, which is rarely
being issued.

<HEADLINE> Corzine claims donation to black minister preceded his candidacy  </HEADLINE>
By RALPH SIEGEL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW BRUNSWICK, N.J. (AP) - U.S. Senate candidate Jon Corzine
told a college audience on Thursday that his $25,000 donation to an
influential minister's church was made by his family foundation
before he was a candidate for office.
</P>
<P>
   However, documents provided by Corzine himself this week show
the check from the Jon and Joanne Corzine Foundation to St.
Matthew's AME Church of Orange was written on December 9, 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine left the Goldman Sachs investment firm in May 1999 and
by the next month had made public his interest in seeking federal
office, spending his own money on consultants and forming a
political committee to transmit those funds.
</P>
<P>
   The pastor of St. Matthews is the Rev. Reginald Jackson,
executive director of the Black Ministers Council, which has played
a prominent role in recent years on minority and State Police
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although the church council does not usually back political
candidates, its officers, including Jackson, gave Corzine a crucial
endorsement last April in his successful quest to defeat former
Gov. Jim Florio in the primary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about the remark after the Thursday night program that was
taped to be aired on the News 12 cable TV station Wednesday,
Corzine stuck by it and denied it was misleading.
</P>
<P>
   He told a small group of reporters outside the Rutgers
University hall and away from the TV cameras that while the check
was dated in December, it had been promised in July.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said he was not yet a candidate that July, but was only
exploring the idea before making the announcement official in
September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded his own tax records dated the check to December,
Corzine said, ''Right. I pledged it to them before I was a
candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I pledged it to them in the summer. I pledged it to them in
July,'' Corzine said. ''I wasn't a candidate until September.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine said his decision to form committees, hire consultants
and spend funds starting in June did not count as a candidacy. ''It
was in the exploratory phase, because we were actually working to
find out whether we were going to run or not,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine on Thursday continued to denounce claims by Republican
opponent Bob Franks that the donations of the private foundation
were designed for political gain.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine became agitated as news reporters pressed him on the
point, walking away from their questions to get into a car that
whisked him off to what spokesman Tom Shea described as a private
meeting with Florio and some of his aides from the primary.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think it is outside the context of anything I've given
to a lot of other churches,'' Corzine said. ''I don't think anyone
is claiming I was trying to influence the Catholic Church,'' to
which his foundation gave $200,000 last year.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine also told the college audience Thursday he believed it
was proper to keep silent about his foundation gift when the
officers of the Black Ministers Council held a news conference in
April to offer him their personal endorsements.
</P>
<P>
   At the April news conference, another council officer said there
had been no donation from Corzine. Corzine did not speak up to
correct him at the time. He said Thursday he did not because the
question was not directed at him.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt like that discussion that was taking place, was
directed toward them, I let them answer the question,'' he said.
''I think it was the responsibility of the Rev. Jackson to deal
with that.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The question was was Jon Corzine trying to buy political
favors, and he wasn't. Period,'' Corzine said Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Portable Rail Bed Standards Seen  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Consumer Product Safety Commission voted
Thursday to develop mandatory safety standards for portable bed
rails.
</P>
<P>
   The standards will be designed to reduce the risk of entrapment
and strangulation bed rails pose to young children. The CPSC said
it took the action because the industry have failed to adopt a
voluntary standard.
</P>
<P>
   Portable bed rails are intended for use on adult beds to help
prevent children from falling out of bed. In the past 10 years, the
commission has learned of 14 deaths to children, most of whom were
under 2 years old, who became entrapped in a space between the bed
rail and the mattress, as well as 40 near-miss incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Despite manufacturers' labels that warn bed rails are meant for
children 2 through 5 years old, and CPSC warnings against placing
younger children to sleep on adult beds, parents sometimes put
children under 2 on beds when a crib is not available.
</P>
<P>
   If the bed rail is pushed out from the mattress, young children
can fall into the space and suffocate or strangle. CPSC staff
believe a change in the design of portable bed rails could
eliminate the danger.
</P>
<P>
   The first step to creating regulations will be the publishing of
a notice in the Federal Register, followed by a comment period.

<HEADLINE> Dems Offer Scaled-Down Land Proposal  </HEADLINE>
By ALAN FRAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans signaled interest Thursday in a
Democratic proposal for a new multibillion-dollar land conservation
program in a sign of movement on a crucial issue at budget talks.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, President Clinton warned anew that he might veto
spending bills because of other environmental provisions. At the
same time, GOP lawmakers added a new controversy over dam removal
in the Northwest.
</P>
<P>
   ''I've vetoed bills before because they contained''
anti-environmental provisions, Clinton said at the White House.
''And if I have to, I'll do it again.''
</P>
<P>
   As House-Senate bargainers tried crafting a compromise measure
financing the Interior Department, Rep. Norm Dicks, D-Wash.,
proposed setting aside up to $1.4 billion annually for six years to
buy and maintain land for federal and local parks, beginning next
year. Nothing would be spent without the approval of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is smaller than a measure the House has overwhelmingly
approved with Clinton's support requiring the expenditure of $3
billion annually for 15 years. But it is far larger than anything
GOP budget bargainers had previously signaled they would accept,
and they said they liked the discretion it would give Congress in
spending the money.
</P>
<P>
   ''My tentative assessment ... is we'll end up agree to what is
asked for there,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., an author of
the Interior bill.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the Senate rejected a $33 billion measure financing
the Treasury Department and Congress itself -- and providing
lawmakers with a $3,800 pay raise -- House and Senate leaders
searched for ways to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   One possibility was providing extra money for the Internal
Revenue Service and counterterrorism programs that Clinton was
demanding on a separate measure financing the Interior Department,
and pushing both bills through Congress, said Senate Majority Whip
Don Nickles, R-Okla.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the 13 annual spending bills for fiscal 2001, which
starts Oct. 1, have been enacted. Clinton -- along with many
lawmakers of both parties -- is demanding billions in extra spending
for schools, housing and other programs.
</P>
<P>
   With a virtual certainty that the bills will not be finished in
time -- and no taste for a federal shutdown -- lawmakers planned to
approve a measure keeping federal agencies open through Oct. 6
while negotiations continue, said GOP aides speaking on condition
of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   House leaders were hoping a compromise Interior bill would be
ready for floor action next week. Its price tag was soaring past
$18 billion -- more than $3 billion higher than this year's level.
</P>
<P>
   But the measure was still had provisions the administration
opposes dealing with timber cutting in national forests and other
environmental issues.
</P>
<P>
   With presidential and congressional elections less than seven
weeks away, GOP leaders were not relishing any prolonged battles
over the environment, an issue on which the public tends to favor
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday, House negotiators used a 6-4 party-line vote to
accept a provision by Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that would block
federal agencies from removing four dams from the Snake River in
Washington state, or even studying the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has pitted fishermen and environmentalists, who see
dam removal as a way to restore dwindling salmon populations,
against farmers, shippers and users of hydroelectric power the dams
generate. The Clinton administration has said it is an option that
they would not even recommend for at least eight years.
</P>
<P>
   The matter is a politically charged one in Washington state, a
crucial state in this year's presidential race. GOP presidential
candidate George W. Bush has come out against removing the dams,
while Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic presidential
candidate, has said the question needs further study.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, lawmakers from both parties were working to ensure
that their own constituents' needs would be met in the spending
measures.
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., was getting language into
the transportation spending bill that would give a high priority to
five Chicago-area mass transit projects whose federal cost totals
$850 million.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., was seeking language that would
provide at least $70 million to buttress ailing pension funds that
provide health care for 60,000 coal miners.
</P>
<P>
   And bargainers on a separate measure financing energy and water
programs were nearing agreement on adding roughly $2 billion to the
measure above the $22 billion the House approved, including dozens
of new projects.

<HEADLINE> Gov. Whitman makes changes to charter school measure  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Gov. Christie Whitman on Thursday returned
to the Legislature a bill designed to fix inequities in the way
charter schools are funded.
</P>
<P>
   Although she did not touch the funding revisions, Whitman did
suggest three other changes to the bill, A-1344, that require
additional legislative action for the entire bill to become law.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would provide about $10 million more in aid to fund
charter schools to address recent rulings by an independent state
panel that overturned the state's original funding formulas.
</P>
<P>
   One ruling struck down state regulations that said local
districts must give charter schools 90 percent of what they
actually spend on education. Instead, the ruling said the districts
only had to pay the charters 90 percent of what the state deems
sufficient for a ''thorough and efficient'' education, which is
generally less than actual costs.
</P>
<P>
   The difference was about a $6 million loss to charter schools,
with the state paying the freight, under the bill.
</P>
<P>
   The second fix would funnel $3.8 million in state funds through
districts to charter schools for students who transfer from private
and parochial schools, another district or a home-schooled setting
into charter schools.
</P>
<P>
   This way, the local district does not have to pay the charter
school for a pupil it never enrolled in the first place, and
therefore never received state aid for.
</P>
<P>
   These funding provisions remain intact under Whitman's
conditional veto of the measure.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor suggested lawmakers slow down a review of the
experimental schools. The bill called for a report on the schools'
progress by February 2001; Whitman recommended postponing that to
October 2001.
</P>
<P>
   She also opposed a bill provision making permanent enrollment
caps on charter schools, at least until after the results of the
overall review are complete.
</P>
<P>
   Third, Whitman suggested a new bill provision. She wants to
direct the schools to provide the state with the names and
addresses of all students and staff of all the schools in case they
need to be notified of any change in a school's status.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the state revoked the charters of two schools, one
each in Essex and Atlantic counties, due to financial
mismanagement.

<HEADLINE> Floods Kills 64 in India  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Torrential rain and floods in India's
eastern West Bengal state killed at least 64 people and left some
10 million people marooned Thursday as the army struggled to carry
out rescue and relief operations.
</P>
<P>
   ''The situation is very grim. Only the military can help us
out,'' the United News of India quoted West Bengal chief minister
Jyoti Basu as saying in Calcutta, the state capital.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said 26 people were killed in the worst-affected
district of Birbhum.
</P>
<P>
   Indian air force helicopters were dropping food packets in the
affected areas, home to millions, United News reported. Press Trust
of India said many people were stranded on rooftops and dependent
on airlifts for food and water.
</P>
<P>
   Army boats were ferrying people to safer places and carrying
food, medicines and water supplies to inaccessible areas.
</P>
<P>
   The rain has caused extensive flooding, ravaged crops and washed
out houses and grain-filled warehouses. Authorities also discharged
excess water from two reservoirs in the region, increasing flood
levels, United News of India said.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition Congress party members met Deputy Chief Minister
Buddhadeb Bhattacharya to complain that sufficient aid was not
reaching people in five districts, Press Trust reported.
</P>
<P>
   In neighboring Bangladesh, about a dozen people were killed and
35 injured as tornadoes and heavy rains lashed the country,
officials said.

<HEADLINE> With BC-US Racism  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated Press	   A federal report released Thursday finds that the
laws of the
United States meet the requirements of an international treaty on
eliminating racism, but American society itself has not achieved
that goal. Among the reasons that racism endures, according to the
report:
<TEXT>
<P>
   -Persistent attitudes of individual Americans that are steeped
in ''a legacy of segregation, ignorance, stereotyping,
discrimination'' toward minorities.
</P>
<P>
   -Poor enforcement of anti-discrimination laws due to a lack of
resources.
</P>
<P>
   -Rollbacks in affirmative action. ''Too many persons do not
believe that racial discrimination is a common or active form of
mistreatment and are therefore less supportive of race-conscious
remedial actions,'' the report said.
</P>
<P>
   -Economic disadvantage that disproportionately lumps minorities
''at the bottom of the income distribution curve.''
</P>
<P>
   -Discrimination against minorities in employment practices, from
hiring and salaries to tenure, training, promotion and general work
environments.
</P>
<P>
   -Practices that maintain segregation in housing despite laws
that prohibit it.
</P>
<P>
   -Lack of equal access to business capital and credit markets,
technology and technology skills.
</P>
<P>
   -Unequal educational opportunities due to residential
segregation and ''white flight from the public school systems in
many larger urban areas.''
</P>
<P>
   -Police brutality, racial profiling, ''startlingly high
incarceration rates'' and general discrimination in the criminal
justice system that affect minorities, particularly toward blacks
and Hispanics, disproportionately.
</P>
<P>
   -Erosion in voting rights because of a tendency by the federal
courts to restrict creation of minority voting districts.

<HEADLINE> German Jewish Leader Is Concerned  </HEADLINE>
By COLLEEN BARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- The leader of Germany's Jewish community expressed
fears Thursday that a postwar taboo on expressing anti-Semitic
views is breaking down -- and not just in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking to government leaders and foreign dignitaries, Paul
Spiegel honored Germany's postwar democracy during celebrations
marking the 50th anniversary of the Central Council of Jews in
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Spiegel's remarks revealed a pessimism that went deeper than
concerns expressed following a string of right-wing attacks on
foreigners this summer, including a still-unsolved bombing attack
at a Duesseldorf train station that injured 10 recent immigrants
from the Soviet Union, six of them Jewish.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel said that anti-Semitism in Germany has decreased
slightly since 1974 when experts established that 20 percent of the
population exhibited ''manifest anti-Semitism.''
</P>
<P>
   ''What has changed, however, is the openness with which
anti-Semitism is now expressed,'' Spiegel said. ''Many anti-Semites
found it inopportune to express their anti-Semitism 10 years ago.
Today, they express it.''
</P>
<P>
   He said anti-Semitic views have become increasingly common among
the political, industrial and cultural elite since German writer
Martin Walser's 1998 speech expressing frustration that images of
the Holocaust were used against Germans.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel emphasized that anti-foreigner hate, at the root of the
attacks in Germany this summer, is not just a German phenomenon. He
specifically cited Austria, and criticized European Union leaders'
decision to end sanctions imposed after the far-right Freedom Party
joined government.
</P>
<P>
   Spiegel also said the Roman Catholic Church, despite
considerable efforts to improve ties with Jews, is not completely
immune from anti-Semitic thinking.
</P>
<P>
   He cited a recent magazine interview with Cardinal Joseph
Ratzinger, the powerful Vatican official who oversees Roman
Catholic doctrine, expressing what he said was the Catholic
church's hope that Jews will one day embrace Christianity.
</P>
<P>
   ''And we have not heard a final answer why the convinced
anti-Semite Pope Pius IX was recently beatified,'' Spiegel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Central Council of Jews in Germany was founded on July 19,
1950, by Holocaust survivors who chose to remain in the country
that intended their destruction.
</P>
<P>
   Germany's prewar population of 600,000 was the most assimilated
in Europe, Spiegel said, adding: ''Jews' love of Germany proved
itself over time to be one-sided.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 400,000 German Jews escaped the Nazis by emigrating. Of the
remaining 200,000, only 12,000 survived the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish population in Germany was 15,000 by the early 1950s
when the council was founded. By 1989 the population had doubled to
30,000. But since the collapse of communism, Germany's Jewish
population has surged to 85,000 with immigrants from the former
Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the recent violence, the new arrivals want to stay in
Germany, Spiegel said, which is evident by their queries how to
obtain German citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   In his remarks, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder honored the council
for its role in creating a strong postwar democracy and launching a
campaign against right-wing extremism.
</P>
<P>
   He also emphasized Germany's ongoing responsibility to educate
its citizens about the Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
   He said memorials should also remember those who resisted the
Nazis, not to diminish German responsibility, but to disprove the
notion that ''We couldn't do anything'' or ''We didn't know
anything.''

Federal Liberals Feel Pressure To Reduce Fuel Prices
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The federal government, under mounting pressure to
help consumers cope with rising gasoline and home heating bills, is
considering unilateral action if it can't get provincial agreement
on a joint strategy to knock down prices.
</P>
<P>
   Knocking a few cents off federal fuel taxes -- an approach urged
by the Canadian Alliance and Conservatives -- is one option under
study.
</P>
<P>
   But sources say the Liberal government is also considering a
variety of rebate schemes that would ensure the cash goes directly
to taxpayers and doesn't end up padding the profits of the energy
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Finance Minister Paul Martin, who has repeatedly stated he wants
a federal-provincial deal before taking action, continued to insist
publicly Thursday that is his preferred choice.
</P>
<P>
   Joint action is the best way to ensure retail prices drop enough
to make a difference to consumers, Martin suggested outside the
Commons.
</P>
<P>
   ''If there is to be a reduction in excise taxes . . . clearly it
would have to have sufficient impact so that it would not simply
disappear into the pockets of the oil companies, that it would
benefit Canadians.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the scenes, however, government strategists acknowledged
they were feeling the political heat and appeared resigned to
moving on their own if the provinces won't come onside.
Quebec Panel Rules On Trademarks
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Second Cup cafes in Quebec can continue selling
coffee and biscotti under the chain's English-language banner.
</P>
<P>
   The English signs advertising Home Depot, Future Shop and Burger
King, among others, also can stay. A provincial advisory body has
decided chains with trademark names don't have to adopt French
monikers to comply with Quebec's language laws.
</P>
<P>
   The Conseil de la langue francaise concluded there is nothing it
can do about the fact Quebec's French language charter doesn't
apply to signs that are also legal trademarks.
</P>
<P>
   The charter requires that French be predominant on commercial
signs.
</P>
<P>
   The Conseil recommended that Quebec offer incentives to get
chains to voluntarily adopt French names.
</P>
<P>
   Premier Lucien Bouchard suggested Thursday there is little else
the provincial government can do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think we can legislate to say to an organization: From
now on in Quebec, you will use a name different from the one you
have used throughout your existence and throughout the world,''
Bouchard said Thursday in Baie-Comeau, Quebec
</P>
<P>
   Bouchard's comments came after Quebec's deputy premier warned
the province could end up trying to legislate the changes.
Supreme Court Dismisses Bernardo Appeal Application
</P>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- Paul Bernardo, one of the country's most reviled
criminals, appears to have exhausted his last appeal effort.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Supreme Court of Canada dismissed Bernardo's
application to appeal his first-degree murder conviction without
providing reasons, as is usual.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo was convicted in 1995 for raping, torturing and killing
Leslie Mahaffy, 14, and Kristen French, 15, in the St. Catharines,
Ontario, suburb of Port Dalhousie.
</P>
<P>
   Bernardo's lawyer, Tony Bryant, said the dismissal seems to end
his client's legal recourse.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe that it exhausts all options,'' he said from
Toronto. ''If he knows of another appeal, it would be news to me.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope that all of the families, including Mr. Bernardo's
parents, . . . the French and Mahaffy families and the Homolka
family, can finally get on with the rest of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Danson, lawyer for the Mahaffy and French families, said the
decision offers ''substantial closure'' as they rebuild shattered
lives without their daughters.
Ottawa Sets Deadline To End Fishing Dispute
</P>
<P>
   BURNT CHURCH, New Brunswick (AP) -- The federal government has
run out of patience with native lobster fishermen in New Brunswick
and seemed prepared Thursday to bring an abrupt end to the bitter,
potentially explosive standoff.
</P>
<P>
   The Fisheries and Oceans Department gave defiant Mi'kmaq
fishermen from the Burnt Church reserve a deadline of 11 a.m.
Friday to pull their traps out of Miramichi Bay or face
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimatum was in a letter sent by the Fisheries Department
to Chief Wilbur Dedam and the band council at the Burnt Church
reserve informing them the fishery is closed and all traps must be
removed.
</P>
<P>
   While there was no immediate response from the band council, the
mood on the Mi'kmaq reserve in the province's northeast corner was
grim and determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''It will be a good day to die,'' said Frank Thomas, war chief
of the Mi'kmaq warrior society, when asked what he thought will
happen when the deadline passes.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is from the Indian Brook First Nation in Shubenacadie,
Nova Scotia, which lost a critical court decision Thursday that
would have kept Fisheries Department officers from seizing lobster
traps and other native gear.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Court of Canada denied an injunction sought by
Indian Brook challenging the federal government's jurisdiction in
regulating the disputed Maritime lobster fishery.

<HEADLINE> France, Russia Want UN Aid Changes  </HEADLINE>
By NICOLE WINFIELD
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq's Security Council allies stepped up
their campaign against U.N. sanctions Thursday with proposals to
cut the compensation fund for victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait
and delay a $16 billion payout to Kuwait's oil company.
</P>
<P>
   The maneuvering over the U.N. compensation fund for Gulf War
reparations comes amid plans for more passenger flights by Russia
and France into Baghdad. The flights are seen as new attempts by
Iraq's friends to slowly whittle away the decade-old embargo and
tweak its main supporter -- the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The increased flights are an indication of the growing challenge
to sanctions that is expected to come to a head next week in
Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning Sept. 26, a committee of Security Council members is
to decide whether to award a $16 billion payout to Kuwait Petroleum
Corp. from an account funded by proceeds from the U.N. oil-for-food
program.
</P>
<P>
   The program allows Iraq to sell unlimited amounts of oil
provided that it uses the profits to buy humanitarian goods for its
people suffering under sanctions. Thirty percent of every dollar
from oil sales, however, is diverted to an account to compensate
victims of Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   Several countries, including Russia, France, China and Malaysia,
are believed to want to delay the payout to Kuwait's oil company,
which would represent the largest award to a corporation since the
fund's inception. So far, the fund has paid out more than $8
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Iraq has been highly critical of the compensation commission,
accusing it of unfair practices and asserting that most claims --

   Some diplomats and analysts have suggested that Iraq's
accusation last week that Kuwait was stealing its oil may have been
designed to put pressure on the commission to defer a decision on
the Kuwait Petroleum Corp. claim.
</P>
<P>
   French Ambassador Jean-David Levitte on Thursday told the

company -- at a time when oil companies are benefitting from record
high oil prices -- was unconscionable at a time when Iraqis are
suffering from sanctions.

   He proposed that the council consider reducing the amount of
money diverted into the compensation account from 30 cents on the

<HEADLINE> Politics, Barbecue Sauce Don't Mix  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER HOLLAND
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Two more retailers have pulled a popular
regional barbecue sauce from their shelves, citing what they
consider troubling racist aspects to the maker's politics.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion asked 118 of its stores in South Carolina to yank
Bessinger's barbecue sauce by Thursday, and Bi-Lo said it also
would remove Bessinger's products from its 286 stores in the
Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion decided ''it was best for us,'' spokeswoman Wendy
Melton said, while Bi-Lo spokeswoman Joyce Smart Buchanan said some
of Bessinger's business activities ''are unacceptable to us as a
company and to many of our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This is nothing more than an attempt to dictate the religious
beliefs and suppress freedom of expression of all of their American
suppliers,'' said Maurice Bessinger, who operates eight Piggie Park
restaurants besides selling the bottled sauce in stores.
</P>
<P>
   His troubles began after he lowered the U.S. flag in front of
his restaurants and replaced it with the Confederate banner last
month -- in what he said was a protest against federal power.
</P>
<P>
   Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said last week the mustard-based sauce no
longer was welcome at its eight Sam's Club stores in South Carolina
and about 100 Wal-Mart stores in the Carolinas, Georgia, Florida,
Tennessee and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Food Lion had said then it did not plan to banish Bessinger's
bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the time we just thought it was more of a Confederate flag
issue and after some time and looking into it and such we
discovered there was more to it than that,'' Melton said.
</P>
<P>
   At Bessinger's West Columbia headquarters and restaurant he
sells tracts with titles such as ''The Biblical View of Slavery.''
An excerpt from one reads: ''Many of those African slaves blessed
the Lord for allowing them to be enslaved and sent to America.
Because what they had over here was far better than what they had
over there.''
</P>
<P>
   Bessinger said he has offered hundreds of religious tracts and
writings by different ministers at his stores for decades. Food
Lion and Wal-Mart ''have falsely accused me on this slavery bit,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's baloney. I don't support slavery,'' Bessinger said.

<HEADLINE> Nader's Speech Gets Celebrity Boost  </HEADLINE>
By EUN-KYUNG KIM
<TEXT>
<P>
   FLINT, Mich. (AP) -- With Michael Moore along for the ride, Green
Party presidential candidate Ralph Nader stumped for votes Thursday
among the disenfranchised in the city that helped him become a
well-known consumer advocate and brought Moore filmmaker fame.
</P>
<P>
   Both Nader and Moore asked supporters at a rally whether the
town had made any progress under eight years of President Clinton.
The answer: a definitive ''No.''
</P>
<P>
   Both blamed the Clinton administration for failing to improve
the quality of life in the city.
</P>
<P>
   The unemployment rate and crime remain high, large industrial
companies continue to shut down, and more than two-thirds of the
area's school children remain below the federal poverty level,
Moore said. ''All the problems we had 10 years ago we still have
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader said he found it more than ''coincidental'' that Clinton
also was in Flint on Thursday -- across the street from the rally.
He and Moore tried to attend Clinton's event, but were turned away.
</P>
<P>
   ''One of the greatest disemployers of Flint, Michigan, is
William Jefferson Clinton,'' Nader said, referring to the impact of
free trade agreements on the town.
</P>
<P>
   Urging supporters to ''vote your conscience,'' Nader warned
residents against picking the lesser of two evils in the
presidential race -- Democrat Al Gore or Republican George W. Bush.
He urged them against using the ''least-worst approach.''
</P>
<P>
   ''If you reward both parties, those parties will only get worse
every four years.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader was attending another rally Thursday at Michigan State
University in East Lansing.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Flint brought both Nader and Moore their first taste
of notoriety. Nader's high-profile career as a consumer advocate
got its start with his 1965 book ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' a harshly
critical look at U.S. auto manufacturing that focused on the
General Motors Corp. Corvair. Moore's 1989 documentary ''Roger &AMP;
Me'' assailed the company's actions in closing one of its Flint
plants.
</P>
<P>
   Moore said GM employed 40,000 in the city in 1995. It is now
down to 17,000, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''What General Motors did to this city, they can do anywhere,''
Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   Both men were introduced by former talk show host Phil Donahue,
who joined Nader on his ''nonvoter tour'' through the industrial
Midwest, an area rich with battleground states considered tossups
between Gore and Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue first met Nader as a radio reporter in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's always been right on the issues,'' he said of
Nader.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue has another connection to the city -- shortly after Moore
produced ''Roger &AMP; Me,'' its distributor, Warner Bros., had qualms
about releasing it because GM was among its top advertisers.
Donahue then aired two back-to-back shows live from Flint, boosting
sales of the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Nader focused on a ''sliding backwards in environmental
achievement,'' referring to further depletion of the ozone layer,
the increase of global warming and soil erosion, in a speech to
students at the University of Michigan-Ann Arbor. He also cited the
large number of workplace deaths due to trauma and industrial
toxins.
</P>
<P>
   Nader also criticized his exclusion from next month's
presidential debates, saying Bush and Gore won't address the issues
important to most Americans, including the increase in a living
wage, a more balanced transit system, free trade and laws making it
easier for workers to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not going to hear much about these issues in the
upcoming presidential debates between the drab and the dreary,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Nader's poll ratings remain in the single digits, the
consumer advocate has a strong following in Michigan -- and both
Nader and Moore played on the fears of Democrats who fear his
presence on the state's general election ballot will siphon votes
away from Gore.

<HEADLINE> Man charged with making false water tampering report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A Manhattan man who claimed to have felt a
burning sensation after drinking from a bottle of water has been
charged with making a false report, police said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Pardo bought a bottle of Poland Spring water from an
Audubon Avenue grocery store on Sept. 14. Authorities accused him
of then going to a gym on Broadway, where he allegedly mixed bleach
with the water.
</P>
<P>
   Pardo then drank the water, then complained of a burning
sensation and was taken to a hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Making a false report is a misdemeanor, and Pardo faces up to a
year in jail if convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities have been investigating a rash of potential water
tampering cases in the metropolitan area, but have yet to find any
evidence of foul play.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Considers Fund for Rebels  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Colombia's government said Thursday it
might consider creating a fund for leftist rebels if they stopped
kidnapping people for ransom and agreed to a cease-fire.
</P>
<P>
   The statement by presidential peace envoy Camilo Gomez followed
the guerrillas' abduction last weekend of as many as 80 people from
a highway outside Cali, the country's third-largest city.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Thursday, Roman Catholic Bishop Jaime Prieto of the
eastern city of Barrancabermeja urged such a fund be created, to
feed and clothe the estimated 20,000 fighters in Colombia's two
rebel armies.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by reporters whether the government agreed with Prieto,
Gomez said he was not ruling out the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are willing to analyze, under the appropriate conditions,
any alternatives. One of the alternatives could be just that,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's second-largest insurgency, the National Liberation
Army, is still holding as many as 37 of the people they abducted in
daylight raids Sunday on restaurants and an estate outside the
western city of Cali.
</P>
<P>
   The group is presumed to be seeking ransoms as well as political
concessions from the government.
</P>
<P>
   Colombia's biggest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia, also relies on kidnapping -- as well as narcotics
production -- to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   Just how much Colombia needs a solution to its protracted civil
war was demonstrated Thursday, when the city of Bogota canceled the
sale of its phone company, blaming guerrilla violence for scaring
off foreign investors.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Mayor Enrique Penalosa was expected to drive
the Colombian currency downward. Officials had hoped to raise at
least $700 million.
</P>
<P>
   Penalosa said escalating violence was to blame for the aborted
sale.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies who had been expected to bid for the phone
company, known as ETB, were Spain's Telefonica and Italy's Telecom
Italia. Both pulled out, Penalosa said.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign investment in Colombia has withered amid an upsurge in
fighting in the South American country's decades-old armed conflict
during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   Guerrillas have kidnapped foreign executives and regularly
extort private companies as well as bombing oil pipelines and
electrical pylons. The rebels oppose the sale of state-run
industries to international companies, considering it a sellout to
foreign interests.

the vice president was risking national security for ''short-term political

that she was the victim of an unwelcome sexual advance by the president in 1993.
Willey wrote the letters after the alleged advance. The White House released the
letters in 1998 during the Monica Lewinsky scandal after Willey spoke out on

<HEADLINE> Accuser Sues Clinton, First Lady  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Presidential accuser Kathleen Willey Schwicker
sued President Clinton, his wife and his lawyers Thursday, alleging
they illegally released personal letters the former White House
volunteer sent the president.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit was assigned to U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth,
a Reagan appointee who concluded earlier this year that Clinton
committed a criminal violation of the Privacy Act by releasing the
letters.
</P>
<P>
   Schwicker's lawsuit alleges invasion of privacy and recounts the
White House's decision to publicize her friendly correspondence
with Clinton. The release was designed to undermine her story that
she was the victim of an unwelcome sexual advance by the president
in 1993. Schwicker wrote the letters after the alleged advance. The
White House released the letters in 1998 during the Monica Lewinsky
scandal after Schwicker detailed the alleged sexual advance on
national television.
</P>
<P>
   Schwicker also alleges the White House was behind the release of
confidential information about the failure to repay $200,000 that
her husband at the time, a lawyer, took from a client's escrow
account. She signed a contract agreeing to repay the money, but
never did so. Amid mounting debts, her husband committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons' personal lawyer, David Kendall, who was among
those sued by Schwicker, declined to comment about the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The case was assigned to Lamberth because he is handling a
related lawsuit filed by Judicial Watch, the same conservative
group representing Schwicker. The other lawsuit was filed by former
White House employees of Republican presidencies whose FBI
background files were gathered by the Clinton White House.
</P>
<P>
   Formerly Kathleen Willey, she changed her name after her
marriage to longtime friend Bill Schwicker last November.

<HEADLINE> Diamond Group Wants Certifying Plan  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) -- Representatives of the world's
leading diamond exporting, processing and importing countries
agreed Thursday to develop a plan to keep diamonds mined by rebel
groups off the international market.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan, all diamonds sold on the world market would have
to be accompanied by a certificate confirming their origins.
</P>
<P>
   The plan aims to prevent so-called ''blood diamonds'' -- gems
sold by rebels to finance conflicts -- from entering the legitimate
market. Diamonds have helped finance the conflicts in Sierra Leone,
Angola and the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   ''The agreement we have decided upon today is actually a
lifeline out of a situation in which people could feel that they
were unable to distinguish between diamonds from conflicts such as
Sierra Leone and Angola and diamonds legitimately mined,'' said
Peter Hain, Britain's foreign minister for Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement came at the end of a three-day conference on
ending the trade in conflict diamonds that was attended by
ministers and representatives from 20 countries, including the
United States, Russia, Canada and Great Britain. The officials
agreed to co-sponsor a resolution to be presented to the U.N.
General Assembly before December and said they hoped a world treaty
could be created next year.
</P>
<P>
   Estimates on the rebels' share of the $6 billion-a-year
international diamond trade range from 4 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Participants in the conference emphasized, however, that
diamonds were also vital resources for stable countries such as
Namibia and Botswana, and the diamond industry employed tens of
thousands of workers.
</P>
<P>
   The work to halt the illicit diamond trade would not wait for
the ratification of a treaty, Hain said. Diamond industry
representatives and nations involved in the diamond trade would
begin working to stop the sale of conflict diamonds as soon as
possible, Hain said.
</P>
<P>
   The work was necessary, not only to stop the flow of money to
rebel groups, but also to restore consumer confidence in the gems
and ensure the survival of the diamond industry, Hain said.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations already has banned the purchase of diamonds
from rebels in Angola and Sierra Leone. There is no ban affecting
the Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The certification scheme would largely be financed by countries
involved in the trade, said Phunzile Mlambo-Ngucke, South Africa's
minister for minerals and energy. Conference participants hoped the
United Nations would contribute money, she said.

<HEADLINE> Peru Armed Forces Support Fujimori  </HEADLINE>
By MONTE HAYES
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru (AP) -- After days of silence that stirred fears of a
coup, the powerful armed forces sided publicly Thursday with
President Alberto Fujimori in a political crisis over his
dismantling of Peru's much-feared national spy agency.
</P>
<P>
   The declaration of military support, the first since Fujimori
announced his move against the agency Saturday, appeared aimed at
easing public worries in a country with a long history of military
coups.
</P>
<P>
   It seemed to quiet speculation over who really controlled Peru:
the president or his national intelligence chief, who is embroiled
in a bribery scandal that is forcing Fujimori to cut short his
presidency.
</P>
<P>
   But military experts cautioned that spy chief Vladimiro
Montesinos remains powerful, with strong support in the armed
forces, and is working behind the scenes to elude prosecution in
the corruption scandal.
</P>
<P>
   A videotape distributed last week, which showed Montesinos
apparently bribing an opposition congressman, sparked the political
crisis that is ending Fujimori's decade-long grasp on power.
</P>
<P>
   In a joint communique, the commanders of the army, air force,
navy and police said they supported Fujimori's surprise weekend
announcement he was deactivating Peru's National Intelligence
Service and calling new elections in which he would not
participate. Fujimori has said he will remain in power until July
28.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Brazilian President Fernando Henrique Cardoso
said Fujimori told Cardoso the elections would be held in March.
Georges Lamaziere, of Cardoso's press office, said Fujimori laid
out the timeframe in a conversation Thursday. There was no
immediate comment by Peru.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts have speculated Fujimori decided to release his hold on
power after he tried unsuccessfully to fire Montesinos, his closest
adviser during his years in power. If he had not made the decision
to cut his own term short, they say, he would have become a
figurehead president.
</P>
<P>
   A skeptical opposition on Thursday demanded Fujimori guarantee a
free and fair election of his successor, questioning his stated
plans to lead his own transition from power.
</P>
<P>
   Alejandro Toledo, who mounted the only serious challenge to
Fujimori's unprecedented third election, insisted Fujimori must
step down immediately and let an interim government guide the
election.
</P>
<P>
   ''How do we, as Peruvians, return Peru to democracy and the rule
of law?'' said Toledo, a U.S.-trained economist.
</P>
<P>
   Political commentator Fernando Tuesta said Fujimori was intent
on tightly controlling the transition and could not be counted out
for a comeback.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think Fujimori is the kind of person who will just go
off and write his memoirs or give international conferences,'' said
Tuesta.
</P>
<P>
   Military experts and retired army generals with contacts inside
the armed forces cast doubt on whether Fujimori was in control of
the military, despite the communique professing support.
</P>
<P>
   ''The president is mistaken if he thinks by communicating that
the National Intelligence Service is being deactivated his adviser
will be out of a job,'' said retired army Gen. Daniel Mora, a
government critic.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed news reports that Montesinos had moved
his command post from the air base that houses the intelligence
service into the ''Pentagonito,'' headquarters of the army. The
army is the most powerful branch of the armed forces and Montesinos
has hand-picked the generals who fill its key command positions.
</P>
<P>
   ''Montesinos has decided who enters and leaves the army
command,'' said political scientist Fernando Rospigliosi. ''He
manages the apparatus through blackmail, espionage, extortion. They
may eventually get him out, but for now I don't think Fujimori is
in charge of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Rospigliosi said the military communique appeared to be a move
to ease public worries over the crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ''They've done this several times before ... The communique is
for public consumption'' and is intended to make it appear Fujimori
is in charge, Rospigliosi said.
</P>
<P>
   The statement of allegiance from the commanders of the
125,000-member armed forces and 100,000-strong police came after
days of public concern about the military's unusual silence.
</P>
<P>
   ''The high command of the Armed Forces and the general
directorate of the National Police ... reiterate their firm
commitment to collaborate permanently with the government,'' said
the statement, signed by the commander of the armed forces, Gen.
Jose Villanueva Ruesta, and branch commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The communique also said it was denying ''speculation'' of any
recent meetings between Villanueva and top regional military
commanders, all hand-picked by Montesinos. It urged Peruvians to
remain ''calm.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as Peruvians remain deeply divided over
Fujimori's authoritarian rule, filling the capital's streets with
rallies both for and against him in recent days. Fujimori is
credited with defeating bloody leftist insurgencies and ending
economic chaos.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Hits Ohio Town and Kills 1  </HEADLINE>
By KATE ROBERTS
<TEXT>
<P>
   XENIA, Ohio (AP) -- Randi Helton heard only sirens from
ambulances.
</P>
<P>
   Then, ''I opened the back door to look for the dog and heard the
most awful roar you ever heard,'' he said in describing the
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   He and other residents of this southwest Ohio city, where a
twister 26 years ago caused millions in damage, didn't get much
warning Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The tornado killed one man, injured at least 115 other people,
flattened buildings, uprooted trees and tossed vehicles. Two other
tornadoes swept through five counties in northeast and central Ohio
Wednesday night, the National Weather Service confirmed Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Charlie Leonard, assistant city manager, said he was paged by
the city's emergency dispatch center at 7:28 p.m. Wednesday. The
center was alerted by two residents who called after seeing the
tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said that only one of the five warning sirens in the
city went off.
</P>
<P>
   ''By the time we got the call, power was out in that part of
town,'' Leonard said. The sirens do not have backup batteries, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's tornado, Leonard said, followed a path parallel to
the April 3, 1974, tornado that killed 33 people.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Jo Parker, a meteorologist with the National Weather
Service, said the latest storm developed too quickly and moved too
fast to issue a tornado warning.
</P>
<P>
   ''This storm didn't exhibit the classic signature on radar that
indicates a tornado,'' Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Large tornadoes such as the one that struck Xenia Wednesday are
usually easier to track, Parker said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Bob Taft, who declared an emergency in Xenia, a city of
about 24,660 people about 20 miles from Dayton, toured the damage
Thursday morning. The designation allows the city to apply for
disaster relief money. Also, about 45 Ohio Army National Guard
soldiers have been mobilized to assist with traffic control and
security.
</P>
<P>
   Rex Van Pelt, who described his home as flattened, spent
Thursday retrieving what he could and loading it into his
brother-in-law's pickup truck.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't believe we had two tornadoes in this town,'' he said
referring to the 1974 tornado. ''I am starting to think Mother
Nature is out to teach a lesson to the people of Xenia.''

<HEADLINE> Past Haunts Miss. Senate Race  </HEADLINE>
By LIB QUAID
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS (AP) -- Nearly a year after the Senate rejected a state
Supreme Court judge's nomination to a federal judgeship, the
decision is reverberating in Missouri's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Gov. Mel Carnahan told a Missouri Bar Association
forum on diversity that Judge Ronnie White was ''one of my proudest
appointments.'' Carnahan appointed him to the state Supreme Court
in 1995, making him the court's first black judge.
</P>
<P>
   Carnahan's general election opponent, incumbent Republican Sen.
John Ashcroft, led the fight against White's nomination. Carnahan
did not address the controversy over White's federal nomination,
but it came up because White himself said Thursday that the
rejection will have a ''chilling effect'' on the desire of young
blacks to enter the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   Another panelist at the forum, Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer, said
he believes race was an issue, adding: ''I hope the citizens of
Missouri will remember it when it comes time to vote for U.S.
Senate.''
</P>
<P>
   Told about the comments in St. Louis, David James, an Ashcroft
campaign spokesman, said: ''The race-baiting by Mel Carnahan has
begun.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Mel Carnahan's liberal judge wasn't confirmed because law
enforcement officers across Missouri opposed his record of
overturning death penalty cases on legal technicalities,'' James
said.
</P>
<P>
   He said Ashcroft had voted in the Senate for more than 90
percent of minority candidates for the federal bench.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Carnahan, Tony Wyche, responded that Ashcroft
had developed a questionable record on race relations, including
his fight against White.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, more than 300 supporters of White's nomination
rallied at the Old Courthouse to denounce the opposition from
Ashcroft and fellow Republican Bond to White, whose nomination was
rejected on a party-line vote Oct. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Ashcroft said he was opposed to White in the belief that he was
soft on the death penalty and ''pro-criminal.''
</P>
<P>
   Some supporters labeled Ashcroft a racist, although Carnahan
said only that Ashcroft had been insensitive and that the
controversy had racial overtones.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans replied by circulating a 39-year-old picture of
Carnahan in blackface in a minstrel show. The governor apologized
for his own insensitivity.

Gore, Bush Tangle Over Oil Reserve
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD, Md. (AP) -- Democrat Al Gore today proposed tapping the nation's
emergency oil reserve to force down gasoline and heating oil prices, as both
cold weather and the election draw closer. Republican rival George W. Bush said
the vice president was risking national security for ''short-term political
gain.'' With half-full heating oil tanks in the background at a Maryland oil
distributorship, Gore said he had urged President Clinton to approve ''several''
releases of 5 million barrels of oil from the government's stockpile to ease
tight supplies.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Iraq's Security Council allies stepped up their
campaign against U.N. sanctions today with proposals to cut the compensation
fund for victims of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and delay a $16 billion payout to
Kuwait's oil company. The maneuvering over the U.N. compensation fund for
Persian Gulf War reparations comes amid plans for more passenger flights by
Russia and France into Baghdad that are seen as new attempts by Iraq's friends
to slowly whittle away the decade-old embargo and tweak its main supporter, the
United States.

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- On Election Day, nearly 1.4 million voting-age black men

Firestone: Ford Had Wrong Pressure
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The tire pressure that Ford recommends for Explorers is
lower than what Bridgestone/Firestone suggests and makes the popular sport
utility vehicle less safe, a tire company executive told Congress Thursday. The
tire maker wrote Ford this week requesting it raise the recommended pressure
from 26 pounds per square inch (psi) to 30 pounds, Bridgestone/Firestone
executive vice president John Lampe told a House Commerce subcommittee.
Firestone tires, which have been linked to 101 U.S. traffic deaths, are standard
equipment on the Explorer, the world's best-selling sport utility vehicle.

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers join fight to stop new sex offender prison  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - A ranking Republican lawmaker petitioned
Gov. Christie Whitman for help Thursday to block the construction
of a 300-bed prison for sex offenders in Cumberland County.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier plans put the prison in Woodbridge Township, but that
prompted organized opposition and lawsuits from Middlesex County
residents.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders in Maurice River Township initially praised the
plan to put the facility in the state's far southwest corner. The
town's deputy mayor even called it a ''win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   That was before residents balked.
</P>
<P>
   Assembly Speaker Jack Collins, R-Salem, now says residents
should not have to put up with another state prison in their town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although the government of Maurice River Township made the
initial request to be considered as a site, they have since
rescinded their request,'' Collins said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''The citizens of our region, and almost every elected official,
agree with the Maurice Township government's decision,'' Collins
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Assembly speaker cited a Superior Court decision that he
said ''removed any legal impediments to the state's siting
procedures'' as one reason Whitman could agree with his request.
</P>
<P>
   A message left Thursday night for Whitman's spokesman was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
   Collins said he understood the state has a difficult task in
finding a permanent home for the prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''However, the residents of Cumberland County have done more
than their fair share in responding to the state's correctional
needs. They should not be asked to do any more,'' Collins said.
</P>
<P>
   New Jersey officials had agreed to pay Maurice River $200,000 a
year while the prison is being built and $825,000 once it begins to
operate.
</P>
<P>
   The state originally planned to build the facility in the Avenel
section of Woodbridge, on the grounds of East Jersey State Prison
and next to the 30-year-old Adult Diagnostic and Treatment Center,
which houses sex offenders during their prison terms.
</P>
<P>
   But residents objected, and Woodbridge challenged the decision
in court.
</P>
<P>
   The state will continue to house 100 sex offenders at East
Jersey until the $20 million facility opens. A Corrections
Department spokesman said earlier that a ''conservative''
completion date is at least two years away.
</P>
<P>
   The state plans to build the prison and is still considering
Woodbridge or Maurice River, corrections spokesman Chris Carden
said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ''Woodbridge was not taken off the table,'' Carden said.
</P>
<P>
   A Superior Court judge ruled Wednesday the state could continue
to build a temporary prison at Avenel while it searched for the
permanent location, Carden said.
</P>
<P>
   The Maurice River proposal was to put the new prison on the
grounds of Bayside State Prison.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Bayside, a medium-security facility housing
almost 2,400 inmates, Maurice River Township is the site of
Southern State Correctional Facility, a medium-security prison with
about 1,650 inmates.
</P>
<P>
   The new prison will house ''civilly committed'' sex offenders -
those considered dangerous even after their prison terms on
criminal charges end. It will employ about 100 people.

<HEADLINE> Term Limits Proposed in Nebraska  </HEADLINE>
By KEVIN O'HANLON
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- When the dust settled from the whirlwind
1990s term limits movement, voters or legislatures in 18 states had
set caps on how long state lawmakers could serve in office.
</P>
<P>
   Then there was Nebraska. Voters approved term limits measures of
one sort or another three times during the decade but were thwarted
in the courts each time.
</P>
<P>
   The setbacks have not discouraged Guy Curtis, a lawyer in the
town of Imperial who pushed to return term limits to the statewide
ballot Nov. 7.
</P>
<P>
   In Nebraska -- one of 21 states where individuals can create laws
by putting issues to a popular vote -- people will be asked once
again to limit state lawmakers to two consecutive, four-year terms
in their nonpartisan, single-chamber Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've been trying to get legislators to enact term limits for
years,'' said Curtis, who leads the Nebraska Term Limits Committee.
''But a hog won't butcher itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska is the only state with a statewide ballot measure that
would impose term limits.
</P>
<P>
   In New Mexico, voters will decide on a constitutional amendment
that would remove term limits for elected county offices. County
officials have been subject to term limits since 1914. Currently,
they may serve two consecutive four-year terms, then must wait two
years before they are eligible to run for any county office.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide a decade ago, an unhappy electorate latched onto term
limits. Oklahoma, Colorado and California paved the way in 1990 and
others followed
</P>
<P>
   A Omaha World-Herald poll published Friday shows 56 percent of
those asked favored limiting state lawmakers to two consecutive
terms. In past elections, voters overwhelmingly supported such
measures by an average of 58 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, most state lawmakers are against the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an artificial limitation,'' said state Sen. Dave Landis,
who has been in office since 1978. ''Voters ought to have a broad
of range of possibilities, the maximum number of qualified people
able to run.''
</P>
<P>
   Nebraska voters approved term limits for state senators and
members of Congress in 1992 and again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska Supreme Court threw out the first vote because too
few signatures had been collected to get the measure on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court invalidated the second vote, ruling that
states cannot limit federal terms.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Nebraska and nine other states tried ''scarlet
letter'' measures to identify those candidates who oppose
congressional term limits.
</P>
<P>
   But a federal appeals court said Nebraska's 1996 law to label
names on ballots that way would have ''the likely effect of
handicapping a class of candidates.'' Now such laws are under
review by the U.S. Supreme court, with a decision expected next
year.
</P>
<P>
   In states where term limits were enacted, some people are having
second thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   Maine Gov. Angus King will have worked with four House speakers
and three Senate presidents by the time he reaches his two-term
limit. A former term limits supporter, King now believes Maine
voters made a mistake passing retroactive term limits for their
legislators in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ''The present system is too much of a revolving door,'' King, a
political independent, said recently. ''It's a complicated
business, and it takes time to learn the process.''
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't wash with Paul Jacob, director of Washington-based
U.S. Term Limits, which promotes term limits.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you have individuals who serve in office term after term
after term, those folks tend to lose touch and become removed from
life as an ordinary person,'' Jacob said. ''Politicians become
pretty dangerous when they learn the ropes.''

<HEADLINE> INS Clears Way For Rescued Cubans  </HEADLINE>
By ADRIAN SAINZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) -- Immigration officials cleared the way
Thursday for all nine Cubans who survived a plane crash at sea to
stay in the United States and seek residency.
</P>
<P>
   Six of the survivors were released from the Krome Detention
Center and taken to a clinic for a medical checkup. They then were
released to family members in Miami, attorney Roberto Villasante
said.
</P>
<P>
   All were paroled to the United States, allowing them to apply
for residency, said Patricia Mancha, spokeswoman for the
Immigration and Naturalization Service. That process can begin next
September.
</P>
<P>
   Parole also was expected for the remaining survivors, 6-year-old
Andy Fuentes and his parents. Andy's American relatives took the
boy to Kmart on Thursday, helping him get some much-needed shoes as
well as inline skates, basketball, football, baseball bat and
helmet and blue socks.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a pair of skates in Cuba,'' the boy told his
Cuban-American grandfather and uncle in Spanish. ''They were made
of plastic, and they were garbage.''
</P>
<P>
   His parents -- Rodolfo Fuentes and Liliana Ponzoa, both 36 --
remained in a Key West hospital but were expected to be released
Friday.
</P>
<P>
   The family and seven others left Cuba on Tuesday, taking off
from a rural airfield in a Soviet-built crop-duster. Low on fuel,
the plane was ditched into the Gulf of Mexico between Cuba and
Mexico, killing one of the men aboard. The others were rescued by a
nearby cargo ship.
</P>
<P>
   ''The escape ... was planned way before,'' said Fuentes'
brother, Rafael, who said he talked to Rodolfo in the hospital.
''The bad part is that the pilot got lost ... The pilot realized he
was running out of fuel so he stopped looking for land and started
looking for a boat.''
</P>
<P>
   The survivors were taken to Key West and Miami, where they were
interviewed by U.S. immigration officials to determine if they are
eligible to stay in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban Adjustment Act allows Cubans who reach American soil
to apply for U.S. residency, while most Cubans picked up at sea are
repatriated.
</P>
<P>
   Complicating the fate of the crash survivors were the
circumstances of the flight. In the past, federal authorities have
returned hijackers to Cuba for prosecution or has put them on trial
but the FBI said Thursday that this week's flight was not a
hijacking.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban government called the theft of a state-owned plane an
act of piracy. It said the topic was raised during migration talks
between the two countries Thursday in New York but remained
unresolved.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Cubans will gather for a national protest similar
to those held frequently during the national campaign to repatriate
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez, a moderator on an evening public affairs
program said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those released from the detention center in Miami were the
pilot, Lenin Iglesias Hernandez, his wife, Mercedes Martinez, 34,
their sons Erik, 13, and Danny, 7, and Pavel Puig and Jacquelin
Viera, both 28.
</P>
<P>
   Puig's brother Yudel Puig Martinez, 23, died in the crash.

<HEADLINE> Military Junta Stops Suu Kyi Leave  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) -- Pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi was
forced to turn back from a renewed attempt to assert her freedom of
movement Thursday, when she tried to board a train out of the
capital but authorities refused to issue her a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said the 1991 Nobel
Peace Prize winner was later ''forcibly removed'' from the train
station, calling the actions by the military government an
''outrage.''
</P>
<P>
   The standoff at the train station followed an attempt by Suu Kui
and some of her supporters in August to travel by car out of the
capital of Yangon for political work only to be stopped on the road
and put under virtual house arrest until early this month.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Suu Kyi and several colleagues from her National
League for Democracy were allowed to go to the railway station but
were kept from boarding four consecutive trains for the 12-hour,
350-mile journey to Mandalay, the country's second-biggest city.
Suu Kyi and her party's leaders were told that all tickets to
Mandalay had been sold out, a party official said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, before Suu Kyi's arrival, security forces hauled scores
of Suu Kyi's supporters from the station.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi, deputy party leader Tin Oo and about 10 members of the
party's youth wing, sat in a waiting lounge after the last train to
Mandalay departed at 9:30 p.m. Plainclothes and uniformed police
were also in the waiting area, which was barred to ordinary
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi and the others waited for about four more hours inside
the station, then left in a convoy of cars. No marked police or
military or uniformed officers were seen in the convoy. Suu Kyi's
car was seen later at her residence.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear if Suu Kyi and her backers were forced out of
the station, which was closed to journalists during the standoff.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, Madeleine Albright said that Suu Kyi's
whereabouts were unknown after being ''forcibly removed.''
</P>
<P>
   ''This blatant, heavy-handed action is only the latest outrage
committed against Aung San Suu Kyi and other party leaders by
Burmese authorities,'' she said in a statement. ''It is
unacceptible.''
</P>
<P>
   Albright said in a statement that was ''appalled'' at the
government's treatment of Suu Kyi and the NLD, and called the
restraints on the party ''an affront to free peoples everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi won the Peace Prize for her struggle for democracy in
Myanmar, also known as Burma, which has been ruled by its military
since 1962. She was kept under house arrest from 1989 to 1995, and
her movements have remained heavily restricted.
</P>
<P>
   Although Suu Kyi's party won national elections in 1990 in a
landslide, the military government refused to honor the results.
</P>
<P>
   The junta disapproves of Suu Kyi's efforts to conduct party work
in the countryside and has physically prevented her from doing so
on several occasions -- the last time Aug. 24 when she tried to
drive to a southern town.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as security restrictions on Suu Kyi and her party were
lifted Sept. 14, she announced her intention to travel again and
dared the government to stop her.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi last tried to travel by train, also to Mandalay, in
March 1996, when authorities blocked her by saying her carriage had
developed mechanical problems and could not make the journey.
</P>
<P>
   Tin Oo, the party's second in command, said the same situation
could arise again, but said: ''If they stop the train we will go by
another train. And even if this is stopped we will wait until
another train is available.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Myanmar's Foreign Minister Win Aung told the
United Nations that his government has been under ''unfair
scrutiny'' and political pressure from other nations while it is
establishing its own kind of democracy.
</P>
<P>
   The military has ruled Myanmar since 1962. The current generals
took power in 1988 after crushing a nationwide uprising for
democracy, killing thousands of people.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITS to INSERT AP bug  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) - A ''clean-cut'' law student and his brother are
facing criminal charges that they conspired to make $2 million by
selling secrets to lawyers representing tobacco companies in a
high-stakes lawsuit in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   In papers filed Wednesday in Manhattan federal court,
prosecutors revealed they were trying to negotiate a plea deal with
the Quinnipiac College student, Said Farraj, 27, and his brother,
Yeazid Farraj, 24, both of Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI arrested the pair in July on charges they stole
anti-tobacco lawyers' 400-page ''trial plan,'' and then tried to
peddle it through e-mail to defense attorneys for Philip Morris,
Inc. and other companies.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted on the most serious charge - interstate theft -
they could be put behind bars for up to 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, Said Farraj's lawyer and a Philip Morris attorney
refused comment on Thursday. An attorney for Yeazid Farraj did not
return a phone call.
</P>
<P>
   Said Farraj worked as a summer paralegal for a Manhattan law
firm, Orrick, Herrington &AMP; Sutcliffe, representing a trust which
has sued Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and others,
alleging they contributed to asbestos-related illnesses, court
papers said. Damages in the civil case, expected to go to trial
later this year, could exceed $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Farraj ''was a bright guy, a very good worker, clean-cut,''
recalled attorney Michael Stopler.
</P>
<P>
   But Stopler said Farraj abruptly quit after only a month one
Friday in June. According to a statement by an FBI agent, tobacco
lawyers found an e-mail from someone with the screen name
''FlyGuy'' when they arrived at work the following Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The sender said he had obtained an electronic copy of the
plaintiffs' trial plan, and offered a sample of 80 pages. The
closely guarded plan spelled out strategy and contained depositions
and court exhibits.
</P>
<P>
   ''When we realized what it was, we immediately alerted the
plaintiffs,'' said one tobacco lawyer, who spoke on condition of
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Stopler said his opponents ''did the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After the plaintiff lawyers contacted the FBI, an agent posing
as a defense lawyer sent an e-mail response saying he was
interesting in seeing the entire plan. ''FlyGuy'' said that would
cost $2 million, and proposed closing the deal at a McDonald's
restaurant in lower Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Yeazid Farraj showed up at the McDonald's on July 21, where was
met by an undercover agent carrying a duffel bag with $200,000 and
wearing a concealed recording device, court papers said. When the
agent showed him the cash, Farraj allegedly assured him that the
entire trial plan would be e-mailed to tobacco lawyers by ''his
friend on Staten Island.''
</P>
<P>
   Once under arrest, Farraj told authorities that his brother had
hatched the plot after secretly downloading the trial plan, papers
said. The older brother was later arrested at their Staten Island
home; both men are free on $50,000 bail.
</P>
<P>
   The case was first reported this week by The Smoking Gun
Website.

<HEADLINE> Calif. U. Proposes Admission Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MICHELLE LOCKE
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- University of California officials are
proposing a new road to admissions that could bring in more black
and Hispanic students, provided they take a detour through
community college.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, which requires approval by faculty and regents,
would expand offers of guaranteed admission from the current top 4
percent of each high school to the top 12.5 percent at each high
school.
</P>
<P>
   The additional 8.5 percent would not get immediate entry to the
university system, but they would be simultaneously admitted to a
university and to a community college and told what courses they
need to complete the transfer.
</P>
<P>
   Because students would transfer as upperclassmen, the new
program doesn't take away freshman seats. University officials say
they have the capacity to handle up to 3,500 new transfers expected
from the new program by 2005.
</P>
<P>
   The approach could boost enrollment of black, Hispanic and
American Indian students, whose numbers have fallen since the
university system scuttled affirmative action five years ago. The
program could make up to 12,700 more students eligible for
admission. Of those, up to 36 percent are Hispanic, black or
American Indian, the three groups considered underrepresented in
the university system. By contrast, underrepresented minorities
make up 12 percent of the current pool of eligible freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Clearly, it will have an impact on the number of
underrepresented minorities,'' system President Richard C. Atkinson
said at a news conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said the new program won't violate Proposition 209, which
forbids affirmative action in public education because it doesn't
select by race.
</P>
<P>
   The University of California now accepts the top 12.5 percent of
all high school students, which means high-performing schools send
lots of students to university campuses while low-performing
schools send few or none.
</P>
<P>
   If the new program is approved by faculty and regents, students
will be identified at the beginning of their senior year on the
basis of student transcripts and invited to apply to the program.
</P>
<P>
   But Regent Ward Connerly, who led the fight to ban affirmative
action at the university and statewide through voter-approved
Proposition 209, said he'd need some assurance academic quality
won't slip under the proposed change.
</P>
<P>
   He also wishes officials weren't running demographic breakdowns
of the potential new students.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the intent is to somehow influence the number of
underrepresented minorities, then I think that's breaking the
law,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> De Bruijn Sets 50-Meter Swim Record  </HEADLINE>
By PAUL NEWBERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Inge de Bruijn, pursuing her third
swimming gold medal, set an Olympic record in the 50-meter
freestyle at 24.46 seconds, beating out Americans Dara Torres and
Amy Van Dyken.
</P>
<P>
   Ian Thorpe was back in the pool for the Australians, swimming
the freestyle leg of the 400-meter medley relay. He already has
three gold medals and a silver.
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn, winner of the 100 butterfly and 100 freestyle, beat
the 8-year-old Olympic mark of 24.79, set by China's Yang Wenyi.
</P>
<P>
   Torres, the 33-year-old from Beverly Hills, Calif, ignored a
sore shoulder to touch second in 24.96. Van Dyken, the 1996 Olympic
champion in the event, was third at 25.04.
</P>
<P>
   The top 16 advanced to the evening semifinals, with the final
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm actually doing pretty good,'' said Torres, competing in
her third individual event after winning bronze in both the 100
butterfly and 100 freestyle. ''I wanted to break 25 seconds. I know
I'm going to get faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Dyken, 27, of Englewood, Colo., won four gold medals in the
1996 Atlanta Games, including the 50 freestyle in a major upset
over the then-powerful Chinese team.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Van Dyken has undergone two shoulder operations. She
wasn't even sure if she would attend the Olympic trials, but
recovered quickly enough to make the team.
</P>
<P>
   Now, she's in position for another medal.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's probably going to take a world record to win it,'' Van
Dyken said. ''I didn't think that coming in, but Inge is swimming
fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Can the Flying Dutchwoman be defeated?
</P>
<P>
   ''Yes,'' Van Dyken replied without any hesitation.
</P>
<P>
   The 50 freestyle is the only individual event for Van Dyken at
what is likely her final Olympics. She also was part of the world
record-setting team in the 400 freestyle relay.
</P>
<P>
   ''If I start thinking about that, I'll get all emotional,'' Van
Dyken said. ''You've got to go out there and swim like you're going
to be swimming for the next 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   De Bruijn is swimming like that, already assured of being an
Olympic star no matter what happens in her last individual event.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just having fun,'' she said. ''I feel on top of the world,
really confident and comfortable. It feels like I am in a dream.''
</P>
<P>
   The Australians brought out Thorpe again for the anchor leg of
the men's medley relay, even though he's been bothered by an upper
respiratory infection.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Aussies managed only the fourth-best time (3:39.38)
in qualifying, just behind the American team of Neil Walker, Ed
Moses, Tommy Hannan and Jason Lezak at 3:38.59.
</P>
<P>
   Germany led with 3:38.50 and Hungary took second in 3:38.58.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's no longer Australia vs. the USA,'' Moses said. ''We're
just trying to run that medal count up and get as many people to
medal as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team of Courtney Shealy, Staciana Stitts, Ashley Tappin
and Van Dyken struggled to fourth in preliminaries of the women's
400 medley relay in 4:06.16. Australia led with 4:04.75, followed
by Japan and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Tappin swam the final race of her career. The two-time gold
medalist will be dropped from the team for Saturday's final, as
will Van Dyken.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old Tappin said she plans to open ''the hottest
nightclub ever in San Diego.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I've been swimming for 16 years,'' Tappin said. ''Knowing this
was my last race, I wanted it to be happy one. I was smiling the
whole time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kieren Perkins must know the feeling. Written off before the
Olympics, he began pursuit of an unprecedented third straight gold
in the 1,500 freestyle with a stunning time in the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   The 27-year-old Aussie was top qualifier in 14:58.34, pounding
the water and thrusting an arm skyward as the sellout crowd at the
Sydney International Aquatic Center roared.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins has struggled leading up to the Olympics, much as he did
before winning gold at the Atlanta Games. He's one of only three
men with back-to-back 1,500 wins.
</P>
<P>
   Erik Vendt, 19, of North Easton, Mass., was second in 15:05.11,
with Australian Grant Hackett third at 15:07.50. The Aussies are
trying to go 1-2 in the 1,500 for the third straight Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Vendt, who became the first American to break 15 minutes at the
Olympic trials, was among those amazed by Perkins' performance.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was kind of demoralizing,'' Vendt said. ''But I definitely
feel I can come back faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Chris Thompson, 21, of Roseburg, Ore., also made Saturday's
final, qualifying sixth at 15:11.21.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has failed to win a medal in the event since
1984, when Mike O'Brien and George DiCarlo went 1-2 at Los Angeles.
No American even advanced to the final four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Heading into the final two days of swimming, the Americans led
with nine gold medals and 25 overall. The Australians were next
with 12 medals but just four golds.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans were in good position to pick up more medals
Friday night. Brooke Bennett was the top qualifier in the 800
freestyle, an event she won in Atlanta four years ago. Gary Hall
Jr. of Phoenix qualified fastest in the 50 freestyle semifinal.

<HEADLINE> Jones and Greene Set Out To Win  </HEADLINE>
By JOCELYN NOVECK
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- They are the fastest woman and the
fastest man in the world. Last time around, they both missed out.
This time, they are determined not to.
</P>
<P>
   Marion Jones and Maurice Greene both make their bids for gold on
Saturday, in their first Olympics. Barring injury or a miraculous
failure to qualify, all eyes will be on them for the 100-meter
dash, the ultimate sprint and traditionally the most-watched event
in track.
</P>
<P>
   For both athletes, there was heartbreak four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who has captivated fans with her charisma, poise, smarts
and above all talent, missed out on the Atlanta Games when she
broke a bone in her foot playing basketball in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The famous story goes that Jones, at age 8, watched the Olympics
come to Los Angeles. She erased some homework assignments on a
chalkboard and instead wrote: ''I want to be an Olympic champion.''
</P>
<P>
   That determination has never wavered. Only now, at 24, she would
more precisely add: ''I want to be an Olympic champion five
times.'' Because she is on a quest for five gold medals at these
games.
</P>
<P>
   No female track athlete has done that in one Olympics -- in fact,
not even in an entire career. But Jones is so serenely confident
that she makes people believe she can.
</P>
<P>
   ''Just show up and give me a race,'' she has said.
</P>
<P>
   That confidence was on display Friday as Jones smiled broadly
for the crowd, then breezed to victory in her 100-meter opening
heat in 11.20.
</P>
<P>
   She was a basketball star at North Carolina, then turned her
attention fully to track. In the summer of 1997, she won the 100
meters at the world championships. In 1998, she was the World Cup
champion in the 100, 200 and long jump. She competed in 36 outdoor
events in 1998, and won 35 of them. In 1999, she repeated as 100
world champion and placed third in the long jump.
</P>
<P>
   She idolizes Olympic star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who she says has
told her about ''the Olympic spirit that everybody talks about.''
</P>
<P>
   ''She says it's unlike anything you've ever experienced,'' Jones
says. ''That's what I want to experience. That's what I want to
feel.''
</P>
<P>
   Greene wants to feel it, too. Maybe that's why his license plate
reads: ''MO GOLD.''
</P>
<P>
   Like Jones, Greene lost out on the experience four years ago. He
failed to make the U.S. team, and drove to Atlanta, where he cried
uncontrollably as he watched the 100-meter dash from the stands.
</P>
<P>
   He recovered to win two world championships, and to set a world
record of 9.79.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the man who calls himself ''the phenomenon'' exudes
confidence about his chances at Sydney, where he made a good start
Friday by easily winning his first qualifying heat in 10.31.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everybody is coming after me now,'' he said last year. ''Fine,
let them keep on coming.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think about Sydney, and I can't wait. I just can't wait.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the top-billed track races, NBC will say goodbye
to swimming, on a day when American Amy van Dyken is set to defend
her Olympic title in the 50-freestyle. But she faces the red-hot
Inge de Bruijn. The Dutchwoman already has won two gold medals in
these games, and she owns the world record in the 50 free. Also
racing is Australian star Susie O'Neill.
</P>
<P>
   The vigorous U.S.-Australia rivalry could bring an exciting
finish to swimming at the Aquatic Center, with both men and women
competing in the 400 medley relay.
</P>
<P>
   NBC's primetime coverage also features women's mountain-bike
cycling and men's platform diving.
</P>
<P>
   Not to be forgotten is baseball, where an unheralded U.S. team,
staffed mostly by minor-leaguers, has surprised many with its
success. They face powerhouse Cuba on Saturday, in a game to be
featured by MSNBC during the day.
</P>
<P>
   The once-invincible Cubans were stunned by the Netherlands
earlier in the week, ending their Olympic winning streak at 21
games.
</P>
<P>
   Also on MSNBC is men's soccer and the women's gold-medal match
in water polo. CNBC has men's water polo, boxing and sailing.
</P>
<P>
   NBC will also have late-night coverage of men's volleyball and
weightlifting, and daytime coverage of basketball, rowing, beach
volleyball and the men's trampoline final.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 6, Mets 5  </HEADLINE>
By ROB MAADDI
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Omar Daal didn't disappoint Brian Kingman,
even though he had nothing to show for a strong outing.
</P>
<P>
   Daal allowed one run over six innings as he avoided becoming the
first 20-game loser in 20 years, and Pat Burrell drove in the
winning run with a bases-loaded single in the ninth as the
Philadelphia Phillies beat the New York Mets 6-5 Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Lee hit his first homer as a Phillie and Bobby Abreu also
homered as Philadelphia wasted a 5-1 lead, then recovered to defeat
the Mets for the seventh time in 10 games this season. New York
dropped to 7-13 in September.
</P>
<P>
   After the Mets scored tied it in the ninth against Jeff Brantley
(2-7) on a home run by Todd Zeile and a pinch RBI double by Robin
Ventura, the Phillies rallied off Rick White (2-3).
</P>
<P>
   Doug Glanville led off the ninth with a single, took third on
Abreu's double off the left-field wall and scored on Burrell's
single after an intentional walk to Scott Rolen. Burrell is
8-for-11 with 20 RBIs when batting with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, acquired along with Lee and two others July 26 from
Arizona for Curt Schilling, allowed one run and six hits and left
with a 5-1 lead. He remained 3-19 and is 0-7 in eight starts since
beating San Diego on Aug. 8.
</P>
<P>
   Daal, a 16-game winner last year, failed to become to become the
first 20-game loser since Kingman for Oakland in 1980. Kingman flew
in from California to watch the game at Veterans Stadium, and was
thrilled with the outcome.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want to be the last 20-game loser,'' said Kingman, who
called a reporter for directions to the stadium after his flight
landed in Baltimore. ''I suffered so much doing it. Now, it's kind
of fun so I want to get some mileage out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kingman plans to go to Chicago for Daal's next start, scheduled
for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   New York dropped 4&AMP;frac12; games behind first-place Atlanta in the NL
East. The Mets, who have lost seven of their last eight games at
Veterans Stadium, began the night five games ahead of Los Angeles
in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed allowed five runs -- four earned -- and eight hits in 5
1-3 innings -- his shortest outing since July 17.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Prince hit an RBI grounder in the second, Abreu homered in
the third and Lee connected in the fourth -- his first home run in
154 at-bats since July 4 for Arizona against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton homered in the fifth, but the Phillies scored twice
in the sixth on Reed's wild pickoff attempt with a runner on third
and Prince's RBI double.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Gomes let the Mets back into the game by walking the bases
loaded in the seventh. Vicente Padilla walked Benny Agbayani,
forcing in a run, and pinch-hitter Mike Piazza singled in a run --
making him 10-for-53 (.189) in September with five RBIs. With the
bases loaded and two outs, Padilla struck out Todd Pratt.
</P>
<P>
Notes@: The Phillies have won 10 of the last 13 against the Mets
dating to last season. ... Piazza and Ventura didn't start. Ventura
is hitting .219 in September (14-for-64). ... Abreu is 10-for-21
(.476) against Reed. ... Rolen was 1-for-16 against Reed before
hitting a single in the first. ... Daal was 2-10 with a 7.22 ERA in
Arizona. He's 1-9 with a 4.85 ERA with the Phillies.

<HEADLINE> Judge Dismisses Slave Labor Cases  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID KRAVETS
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Surviving World War II prisoners of war who
allege they were used as slave laborers by some of Japan's biggest
corporations cannot seek compensation from the companies, a federal
judge ruled Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   In dismissing lawsuits brought by about three dozen former POWs,
U.S. District Court Judge Vaughn Walker ruled that a 1951 peace
agreement between the United States and Japan bans such
compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
   ''History has vindicated the wisdom of that bargain,'' the judge
said. ''And while full compensation for plaintiffs' hardships, in
the purely economic sense, has been denied these former prisoners
and countless other survivors of the war, the immeasurable bounty
of life for themselves and their posterity in a free society and in
a more peaceful world services the debt.''
</P>
<P>
   California became a magnet for such cases last year when the
legislature enacted a law allowing victims of slave labor to sue
multinational corporations.

   Lester Tenney, a former POW who said he spent three years in a
slave labor camp toiling in a dangerous coal mine, said after
Walker's ruling that all he wanted was an apology, not money.
</P>
<P>
   ''I want them to say to me that we did you wrong,'' said Tenney,
an 80-year-old Army veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for the targeted corporations -- Mitsubishi Corp.,
Mitsui &AMP; Co., Nippon Steel Corp., Nippon Sharyo Ltd., Japan Energy
Corp., Ishihara Sangyo Kaisha Ltd. and others -- agreed with
Walker's ruling that the treaty essentially settled any American
disputes with Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's definitely a correct ruling. That's what the treaty
said,'' said Margaret Pfeiffer, a Washington, D.C. attorney for
Nippon Steel.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department also weighed in on the case, urging Walker
to dismiss the suits. The U.S. government said the treaty waived
all claims against Japan by the government and its nationals.
Allowing the suits to proceed would undermine the peace accord, the
government said.
</P>
<P>
   The former prisoners' attorneys demanded a rehearing, which
Walker granted and scheduled for Dec. 13. But judges rarely reverse
their own opinions.
</P>
<P>
   David Casey Jr., a lawyer for the prisoners, said the companies
should be liable, regardless of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
   ''These companies owned these people,'' he said.

<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The hometown crowd got a scare, but
Bridgette Gusterson sent them into hysterics and Australia into the
gold-medal game.
</P>
<P>
   The Aussies rallied from two goals down to defeat Russia 7-6
Friday (Thursday night EDT) and move into the finals of the first
women's Olympic water polo tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Gusterson, the team captain, backhanded the ball past Russia's
Marina Akobia with 43.4 seconds to go. But until then, it looked
like Saturday night's gold-medal match with either the United
States or Netherlands would be a much quieter affair.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians were up 6-4 on Irina Tolkounova's goal right before
the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Debbie Watson, a 35-year-old who came out of retirement for the
Olympics, began the rally. She broke up the Russian attack that
brought the tying goal, a long center shot with 1:32 remaining that
sent the 4,000 at Ryde Aquatic Leisure Center screaming.
</P>
<P>
   Sofia Konoukh tried to dump a pass low, but it was taken by
Aussie goalie Liz Weekes.
</P>
<P>
   Gusterson found herself free on the next possession and, with
her back to the net, rifled the ball into the net.
</P>
<P>
   That ensured a packed house for the gold-medal game, played at
the 17,500-seat Sydney International Aquatic Center.
</P>
<P>
   Bronwyn Mayer had three goals for Australia, who have lost only
one of its six games here.
</P>
<P>
   The United States will meet the Netherlands on Friday night in
the other semifinal.

   WILKES-BARRE, Pa. (AP) -- Roman Simicek scored two power-play
goals in the Pittsburgh Penguins' 4-2 exhibition victory over the
Colorado Avalanche on Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old Czech rookie opened the scoring with 54 seconds
left in the first period, deflecting Janne Laukkanen's shot past
goalie Patrick Roy with the Penguins on a two-man power play.
</P>
<P>
   Simicek gave the Penguins a 3-1 lead with 22 seconds left on the
second period off an assist from Jaromir Jagr.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Kostopoulos and Alexei Kovalev also scored for Pittsburgh
(2-2-0). Alex Tanguay and Dan Hinote scored for Colorado (2-2-0).
</P>
<P>
   Sebastian Caron made 24 saves for the Penguins.
</P>
<P>
   Roy stopped 31 shots for the Avalanche, who played without stars
Joe Sakic, Peter Forsberg, Ray Bourque and Chris Drury.
</P>
<P>
   The teams will meet again Saturday night in Hershey.

<HEADLINE> White Sox 9, Twins 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Herbert Perry had a pair of doubles and three
RBIs and the Chicago White Sox lowered their magic number for
clinching the AL Central to four by beating the Minnesota Twins 9-4
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Durham went 3-for-5 for Chicago, which opened a 7&AMP;frac12;-game over
second-place Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Sirotka (15-10) won his fifth consecutive decision despite
falling behind 3-0 in the third. He wound up allowing three runs
and a season-high 10 hits in 6 2-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Johan Santana (2-3) lost for the first time since April 22 at
Texas, giving up seven runs and seven hits in 4 2-3 innings. Matt
Lawton was 3-for-4 with a walk for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota went ahead on David Ortiz's RBI single in the first
and Matt Lawton's two-run single in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago, held to one hit the first three innings, tied it in the
fourth on Perry's RBI double and Jeff Abbott's two-run single, then
took a 7-3 lead in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez's sacrifice fly and Carlos Lee's RBI single
chased Santana, and reliever Jason Ryan hit Paul Konerko with a
pitch, loading the bases for Perry, who hit a two-run double down
the third-base line.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's RBI double and Ordonez's run-scoring grounder in the
eighth made it 9-3 against reliever Jason Ryan.
Notes: Ordonez needs one run to become the fifth White Sox player
to score 100 runs this season. Thomas' single gave him 184 hits,
one shy of his career high, set in 1992. ... Sirotka has allowed
just one home run in his last seven starts, a span of 47 2-3
innings. ... Lawton made a diving catcher of Perry's sinking liner
to right in the second inning and Cristian Guzman went deep in the
hole at shortstop to throw Perry out in the seventh. ... Santana
made his fifth start of the season.

<HEADLINE> Tampa Bay LW Suspended Indefinitely  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Tampa Bay left wing Gordie Dwyer was
suspended by the NHL on Thursday, pending a hearing, for his fight
with Washington's Joe Reekie on Sept. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer and Reekie, a former Tampa Bay defenseman, fought during
the third period of the teams' 4-4 exhibition tie. Dwyer received
minor penalties for charging and roughing, a 10-minute misconduct
and two game misconducts. Reekie received a 10-minute misconduct
and a game misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay general manager Rick Dudley said Dwyer could receive a
long suspension.
</P>
<P>
   ''What I told Gordie, it's done. There's nothing you can do
about that,'' Dudley said. ''It happened. It was a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Dwyer was suspended until a hearing is conducted. No date for
the hearing has been set.
</P>
<P>
   The Lightning added defenseman Mel Angelstad, who has recorded
more than 400 penalty minutes twice in an eight-year minor league
career, to their training camp roster.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay also returned Nikita Alexeev, the team's first-round
pick in the 2000 draft, to Erie of the Ontario Hockey League.
Forwards Nils Ekman and Thomas Ziegler were sent to Detroit of the
International Hockey League.

<HEADLINE> Volleyball: South Korea 3, Peru 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- South Korea recovered from an awful
start to defeat struggling Peru 3-1.
</P>
<P>
   Ku Min-Jung and Chang So-Yun came up with the big shots late in
the decisive third game, and South Korea went on to a 19-25, 25-19,
30-28, 25-17 victory Friday (Thursday night EDT).
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans (3-1) pulled even with Cuba for second place
in Group B, although Cuba has the tiebreaker with an edge in the
won-lost ratio.
</P>
<P>
   Peru (0-4), which had not won a game in its three previous
lopsided losses, scored the first three points of the match and
kept its momentum going.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans are known for their defensive work ethic, but
it was Peru that made the saves from the backcourt and built a
17-13 lead. South Korea got in just 25 percent of its kill
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea rallied to win the second game easily, and the teams
went back and forth through the third. Peru had a game point but
was called for a net touch to force a 24-all tie.
</P>
<P>
   The South Koreans won a key point with two fantastic fingertip
saves on one play to go ahead 25-24. Peru withstood four match
points, but South Korea put the game away on consecutive hits by Ku
and Chang.
</P>
<P>
   The Peruvians tried to come back, getting within 14-12 in the
fourth game, but they could get no closer.
