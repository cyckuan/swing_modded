BOY RECOVERING AFTER DOCTORS REATTACH ARM TORN OFF BY CAR

<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The Panorama City, Calif., boy whose arm was
severed in an accident remained in critical condition at UCLA
Medical Center after surgeons successfully reattached the limb
during six and a half hours of surgery Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves were reconnected and circulation has been restored to
Anthony Tirado's arm and hand, hospital spokesman Warren Robak said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The 8-year-old is awake and alert, but it's too early to outline
a long term prognosis for the function of his arm, Robak said.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's arm was severed Thursday afternoon as his mother was
preparing to take him to his uncle's home for a camping trip over
the Fourth of July weekend, according to Robak.
</P>
<P>
   Mother and son had just pulled out of the driveway in her car,
when Anthony's father called them back so they could take a coil of
rope, the mother explained.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's mother said she sent him back to the house to retrieve
the rope, which he threw over his shoulder before climbing into the
rear passenger side of the car, Robak said.
</P>
<P>
   But unknown to Anthony and his mother, he had shut the door on
part of the rope, leaving a section dangling. As Anthony's mother
began to drive away, the dangling rope became entangled in the rear
tire, pulling the rope tight and severing his arm, Robak said.

GERMANY STUNNED BY CROATIA
</HEADLINE>
 FOR THOSE NEEDING-LADN (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LYON, France _ The sense of history wasn't lost on the
Croatians, who have endured so much of the stuff in a few short
years, rarely with the joy that accompanied what they achieved
Saturday night at Stade Gerland.
</P>
<P>
   In what is by far the biggest stunner of this World Cup, of many
World Cups, for that matter, Croatia tiny, inconsequential Croatia
took its place among the final four with a 3-0 romp over three-time
champion Germany in a clash fraught with controversy.
</P>
<P>
   A disputed red card, which forced the Germans to play with only
10 men for more than half the match, provided the means for a
Croatian triumph, an historic conquest that left one side rapturous
and the other bitter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still not aware of what we have done,'' defender Slaven
Bilic offered after the Croats, playing in their first World Cup,
claimed a spot in Wednesday's semifinal against France in
Saint-Denis. ``This is a dream come true, but we are not afraid of
anybody. ... When (Coach Miroslav) Blazevic said two years ago that
we were the best in the world, we all laughed. But we are laughing
less and less now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think,'' goalkeeper Drazen Ladic added, ``we can say we're
the best team in the world tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a point with which the Germans might argue, given their
mood following Norwegian referee Rune Pedersen's expulsion of
defender Christian Woerns their top player this tournament for a
clumsy attack on Davor Suker in the 40th minute. Their dominance,
unfailing to that point, quickly evaporated, and Robert Jarni's
stirring strike nearly three minutes into injury time provided the
Croats with everything they needed.
</P>
<P>
   When Goran Vlaovic, with a near carbon-copy of Jarni's blast,
and Suker added counterattack goals in the final 10 minutes,
Croatia had avenged a similarly controversial defeat in the
European Championship quarterfinals two years ago to become the
first Cup debutante since Portugal in 1966 to reach the final four.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our country is going to be burning in celebration,'' said
Suker, whose goal was his fourth of the Cup. ``We played with our
hearts. ... This shows not always do the big teams win.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big, big, big, big, big victory for us,'' said Dario
Simic, seeking some sort of perspective. ``We're a small country.
Right now it's incredible what we've done.''
</P>
<P>
   To place it in context, Croatia which gained its independence
from Yugoslavia seven years ago is a nation of 4.7 million people;
Germany has 6 million registered players.
</P>
<P>
   The only one that counted, ultimately, was Woerns, whose
midfield challenge on Suker was indeed late he slammed into the
Croat's knee after the ball had been pushed past but didn't appear
premeditated. Pedersen's penalty seemed harsh, but he was
challenged all night by a particularly rough affair, full of shoves
and elbows, in which 54 fouls were whistled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen the replay on television,'' Woerns said, ``and I
think that the red card was a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision raised the ire of the Germans, whose win over
Croatia in 1996 was largely determined by a questionable red card
that gave them the advantage. This time, the Croats took charge,
using the extra man to find space in what had been a tight,
organized German defense.
</P>
<P>
   After Jarni's goal a 22-yard blast inside the right post after a
nifty run and feed from Mario Stanic Germany was forced to push
forward, leaving plenty of space for the Croat counter to exploit.
It led to myriad chances, then, finally, Vlaovic's goal in the 80th
minute. Suker added his in the 85th.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not us who lost the game, but it was the referee who
cost us the match,'' charged German defender Juergen Kohler. ``The
red-card decision was unjust. It was ridiculous. Why is it always
the Germans who get cheated.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very clear that the red card was not a red card,'' said
sweeper Lothar Matthaeus. ``The quality of refereeing was well
below standard. I'm not alone in blaming the referee, but we also
have to take responsibility for the loss. Even with 10 men, we had
our chances. This shows the diminishment of the quality of
refereeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Germany, which failed in the quarterfinals for the second
successive World Cup after reaching the semifinal round the
previous seven tournaments, had plenty of opportunity to take
charge. Dietmar Hamann put a header just over the bar in the 22nd
minute, and Oliver Bierhoff forced Ladic to make a diving save on
another header in the 31st. That one was especially dangerous Ladic
couldn't hold on to the ball, and Juergen Klinsmann rushed in to
knock home the rebound; Ladic, lying on the ground, booted the ball
away.
</P>
<P>
   Ladic, who has three shutouts and has surrendered only two World
Cup goals in five matches, made another strong save on Bierhoff in
the 52nd, and a Hamann blast off a free kick ricocheted off the
Croatian wall and kissed the left post in the 78th. By the end,
German coach Berti Vogts whose ``David and Goliath'' comments on
Friday angered the Croats had four strikers on the field, to no
avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``True, it's difficult,'' admitted Vogts, whose team
demonstrated the usual German organization but little flair. ``I
have to say that until Woerns was sent off, there was no doubt that
Germany put on its best performance of the World Cup so far.
There's no point going over and over the question of the red card.
The fact is Croatia goes on to Paris ... and we go back home.''

NOVOTNA GIVES TAUZIAT A SLAM DUNK
</HEADLINE>
 TEN-WIMBLEDON-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Jim Greenidge 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ It's a long climb from the grass court, up into the
stands, charging down the aisles between the fans, turning left,
then right, to reach the friends' box at Wimbledon's Centre Court.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Novotna wanted to make that climb, no matter how long it
took, after she won her first Wimbledon singles title Saturday with
a 6-4, 7-6 (7-2) victory over Nathalie Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Novotna wanted to embrace Hana Mandlikova, her
coach since 1990, who had seen her suffer from nerves in a
three-set loss to Steffi Graf in the 1993 Wimbledon final, a match
Novotna led, 4-1, in the final set before losing.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna's nerves were steadier last year, when she had another
three-set loss, this time against Martina Hingis. But it was a
loss, nonetheless.
</P>
<P>
   The third time was the charm for the 29-year-old Novotna, who
finally won her first Grand Slam title.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always said that winning one Grand Slam would mean so much
to me and winning Wimbledon means everything, really,'' said
Novotna, who defeated Venus Williams in the quarterfinals and top
seed Hingis in the semis.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I have been working for for many, many years, and
this is a definite dream come true for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna served for the match at 5-4, but hit an easy volley into
the net, made three other errors, and Tauziat converted her third
break point, a forehand volley winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't serve well at all the whole match,'' said Novotna.
``I struggled with my serve simply because I felt so much pressure
from Nathalie. I knew that every second serve she's going to take
it in, she's going to be all over the net, and it would be
difficult to pass her.''
</P>
<P>
   But Novotna held for 6-6 and dominated the tie-breaker, winning
5 straight points from 2-2, closing out the match with a forehand
return for a winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be aggressive and either it's going to work out or
it's not,'' Novotna said. ``I finally made some first serves and
the beginning of the tie-breaker was really important. I felt like
in the tie-breaker, I was ready to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   She was totally amazed that she won the title without much help
from her serve, punching in just 67 percent. She blamed Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   ``She takes the ball very early,'' Novotna said. ``If I served a
hard serve, she didn't really mind. She has such great hands, she
can just block the serve and still give you a very difficult
volley. I had the pressure to hold (serve).''
</P>
<P>
   But Tauziat's second serve was rather passive, more a simple
toss-in than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt me,'' said Tauziat, the first Frenchwoman to reach the
Wimbledon singles final in 73 years. ``If I didn't put the first
serve in, it was tough, and she came in with very aggressive balls,
very low so it was very difficult to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Tauziat's first Grand Slam final, at age 30, and she
was definitely the underdog. Still, with the series between the two
split at four wins each, Tauziat knew she could possibly defeat
Novotna.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knew that she has done it before, she beat me a number of
times,'' said Novotna, who, with Mandlikova, sat and watched a tape
of Tauziat's victory over Natasha Zvereva in the semifinals. ``She
knew how to play me, so I think she felt she had a great chance to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She played better than me. She deserved to win Wimbledon,''
said Tauziat. ``I have nothing to regret in this match, that's
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Novotna and the Duchess of Kent chatted a while during the award
ceremony. They had gotten to know one another quite well in 1993,
after the Czech's loss to Graf, when Novotna broke down and cried
on the Duchess's shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very nice, and she was pleased that I won this
championship,'' Novotna said. ``She told me she's just as happy as
I am for me, for finally winning this championship. I'm sure she
knows how much this means to me.''

NIRVANA FOR JANA AT WIMBLEDON
</HEADLINE>
 TEN-WIMBLEDON-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Bud Collins 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sometimes funerals are joyous occasions. They had one
at Wimbledon Saturday afternoon where the corpse was laid to rest
at 3:44 in a plot called Centre Court as 13,120 celebrants whooped
and clapped for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   Tears gushed from the pale blue eyes of Jana Novotna, though she
wasn't mourning. Absolutely not. She had a racket in her hand that
seemed a spade because she was burying the past for good, and
crying gleefully. Relieved. Exonerated. Redeemed.
</P>
<P>
   She was _ ``at last, at last'' _ the Wimbledon champion, 6-4,
7-6 (7-2), over a worthy, if undervalued, rival, Nathalie Tauziat.
With one last shovelful of yellow tennis ball _ a resounding
forehand swat _ Jana found nirvana, killing the year 1993 and
pronouncing the last rites. Let's call the deceased Pan 1993 (Mr.
1993), as they might in Brno, Czech Republic, where Novotna
originated way back in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Jana came away from the funeral, a friend asks,
``Is Pan 1993 buried now?''
</P>
<P>
   Her face radiating a championship gleam, Jana pauses
thoughtfully, and replies, ``Yes, 1993 is buried. Definitely.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Pan 1993 can be merely a friendly ghost instead of the demon
that had tormented her since that afternoon, just five years
before, when Jana established herself as one of the prime
philanthropists in Wimbledon chronicles. She handed the title to
Steffi Graf on a silver platter _ the huge Rosewater Dish _
emblematic of dominance, 7-6 (8-6), 1-6, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   Novotna, dreamily charging and checkmating Graf for a dozen
games, led, 4-1, 40-30. Then she floated a double fault somewhere
into the stratosphere. Abruptly it was all over, and she gushed
like a busted fire hydrant for love's labor lost. The
prize-presenting Duchess of Kent almost drowned in the lachrymal
tidal wave, and Novotna was, of course, labeled the biggest choker
since the formidable diamond necklaces worn by Queen Victoria.
</P>
<P>
   Interviews became an ordeal as she insisted nerves hadn't
betrayed her. ``You journalists did not help in a good way, always
talking about choking,'' Tauziat is defending Novotna Saturday.
``Stop talking about the past. She is a fighter. She has showed it.
Did she choke last year? No.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless Novotna didn't win that final either, losing, 2-6,
6-3, 6-3, to Martina Hingis, failing to hold a 2-0, 40-30 lead in
the third set.
</P>
<P>
   But this time she was the resilient, rebounding, self-assured
lady. In beating a trio of top 10 rivals (No. 9 Irina Spirlea, No.
7 Venus Williams, and No. 1, the champion Hingis) as well as No. 16
Tauziat, Jana surged from 1-4 against Williams, 0-3 and four break
points against Hingis, and 2-0, 40-15 down against Tauziat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hingis was a piece of cake,'' she says, blithely recalling her
brilliant 6-4, 6-4 semi. ``No pressure there. She was the big
favorite.''
</P>
<P>
   Who would ever refer to Hingis as a pastry patsy? Then what did
that make Tauziat? A piece of stale French toast to choke on again?
</P>
<P>
   It starts to look that way as Novotna works her way to
championship game at 5-4, volleying as the bandit of the barrier,
acrobatically ripping off Tauziat's best shots. The match is on her
racket, in her prestidigitating hands _ but, whoops, her volleys go
awry. It's 0-40. Her legs calcify, she stops racing to the net
behind serve.
</P>
<P>
   Still she fights her way to deuce. Two points from victory. Not
close enough. She subsides, and it's 5-5, then 6-5, for the
Frenchwoman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was struggling with my serve,'' Jana says. ``It had worked
so well against Hingis (no double faults), but not now (seven
double faults). Tension, yes,'' Jana admits. ``Tense all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   As mirror images, daring serve-and-volleyers who understand
grass, it's a wonder they didn't bump heads in their eagerness to
nose in on the net.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting pressure on each other's serve.'' Jana says. ``I
know if I miss the first one she'll come in on the second. And she
knows that about me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny when I lost my serve to 5-5, I relaxed a little. In the
tie-breaker I said to myself, `This is really wonderful! How can
you win Wimbledon without a serve? But you have to be aggressive
anyway, whether it works or not.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, there was pressure _ but,'' she smiles, ``but this time I
believed in myself. I believed.''
</P>
<P>
   Believing meant doing. And doing in Pan 1993. He should have
expired Dec. 31 of his year _ but disagreeably hung around in her
psyche until this golden afternoon for the platinum-haired golden
oldie, edging up to all of 30.
</P>
<P>
   Gelid and gray, it was a good gloomy day for a funeral.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did I do on the last point?'' asks Jana, the undertaker,
who didn't miss a first serve in the breaker. ``I can't remember.''
</P>
<P>
   A roaring, winning forehand return of a second serve, she is
informed, a true championship blow, a stake in the heart of Pan
1993.
</P>
<P>
   R.I.P. More importantly, deserved peace as well for Jana, who
danced on the grave.

WINDY CONDITIONS FAIL TO DEFLATE PAK
</HEADLINE>
 GLF-USWOMEN'SOPEN-BOS (For use by New York Times News Service clients) 
By Jim McCabe 
c.1998 The Boston Globe 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Blown away by winds of up to 25 miles per hour,
overmatched at times by a long, difficult golf course, unable to
get at pins on rock-hard greens that are bigger than most
backyards.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, things went pretty well for those playing in
Saturday's third round of the US Women's Open at Blackwolf Run.
Red, white, and blue were the colors of choice, except for
professional egos; they were black and blue.
</P>
<P>
   How difficult were the conditions? Consider Liselotte Neumann,
one of just two players under par beginning the day. She made five
straight bogeys on the back, hit her second shot into the water at
the par-4 18th, came home in 40, shot a 4-over 75 _ and did not
lose any ground.
</P>
<P>
   Neumann is still chasing 20-year-old South Korean Se Ri Pak,
whose three-putt 18 gave her a 75 for a 1-over 214 total. Neumann
is at 215, tied with unheralded Mhairi McKay, who was one of three
players to shoot 73, the low round of the day.
</P>
<P>
   That's correct _ 2-over 73 was the low round of the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ridiculous,'' said Emilee Klein, who was one of 16 in the
field of 62 to shoot 80 or worse on a day when the field average
was 79.88.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do think the USGA did a poor job of setting up the course,''
said Donna Andrews, who shot 75 and is at 7-over 220. ``The course
is tough enough. I don't think they took the wind into account when
setting it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, said Andrews after a moment's thought, ``maybe they wanted
to get their reputation back (after last year's 10-under victory
total set a tournament record).''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing of the sort, said Judy Bell, immediate past president of
the USGA who was responsible for setting up the course. ``We
thought the winds would be 5-10 miles per hour,'' said Bell, ``but
they were more like 25 with gusts of 30. It was brutal out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And she wasn't even playing.
</P>
<P>
   For those who were, the experience was something they'll
probably always remember. Though the scores they'd like to forget.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the wind made for intrigue as it blew names all over the
leaderboard. Neumann, for one, wasn't disappointed when she got to
the course. ``I was quite pleased,'' she said. ``It's the same for
everyone but I don't hit it that high, so I had a good positive
attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   It showed, for her birdie at the first, coupled with playing
partner Pak's bogey, put the 32-year-old Swede into the lead.
Neumann then birdied the par-4 fourth and had a one-shot lead on
Pak, six on McKay. ``When it's windy, it comes down to chipping and
putting,'' said Neumann. ``And putting is my strength, though it
didn't go my way.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the touch left her, probably blown away in the wind.
Neumann three-putted the par-3 eighth to set off a string of events
that changed the complexion of the tournament.
</P>
<P>
   After Pak three-putted from 15 feet on the par-5 10th for a
double bogey to fall two shots back, Neumann returned the favor by
bogeying the par-4 11th. Then the 12th. And the 13th. And the 14th.
And, for good measure, the 15th, too. She three-putted two times in
that sequence and conceded, ``I felt like it was getting me out of
the tournament.''
</P>
<P>
   McKay may be unheralded, but she's an unheralded lady from
Scotland who groomed her game at Turnberry, which may explain what
she did at holes 12-14. She birdied them each for the second
straight day and moved into the lead. ``Tougher conditions than
Turnberry,'' said McKay, who played collegiately at Stanford at the
same time as Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Woods reportedly admires McKay's swing, but doubtful he would
have liked what he saw at the par-3 17th when McKay came over the
top and hit it in the water. She made double bogey. Again it was
Pak's turn to have the lead, thanks to a birdie at the par-4 14th
and three straight bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, but the top spot on the leaderboard was an easy target for
the wind. After McKay made her bogey at 18, the final twosome came
up the fairway, the wind having one more chance to play havoc. It
did, knocking Neumann's approach into the Sheboygan River and
blowing Pak's approach way right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty disgusted with myself,'' said Neumann, who
figured she would go from two shots down to three or four. But on a
day when everything went wrong, so did her thinking. She took her
drop, then chipped in from 35 yards to save par.
</P>
<P>
   When Pak three-putted, Neumann was back within a shot of the
lead, which is where she had started.
</P>
<P>
   As for Pak, who overpowered the course in winning the LPGA
Championship in May and is thus staring at a second major title,
she was asked if she was nervous.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``I don't have nerves. Not nervous.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe she's too young, or maybe she lost them in the wind.

<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers right fielder Juan Gonzalez promises
that his locks of jet black hair will remain in place this season
no matter what.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I know the story,'' says Gonzalez, whose grin eventually
evolves into laughter. ``My hair will not fall out.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, the major leagues' most prolific run producer, knows
the story about former Yankees right fielder Roger Maris, who
produced arguably the game's most significant single-season
accomplishment, breaking Babe Ruth's home-run record in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   The strain of that pursuit and all the attention that came with
it took its toll on Maris, who began losing clumps of hair during
the chase.
</P>
<P>
   Halfway through the season, Gonzalez has positioned himself for
a serious pursuit of the single-season record for runs batted in,
established by outfielder Hack Wilson of the Chicago Cubs, who
drove in 190 in 1930.
</P>
<P>
   That pursuit will generate more interest _ more than Maris ever
encountered in this age of electronic media _ should Gonzalez
remain within striking distance in September. The attention,
though, will not become a distraction, Gonzalez says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've prepared my body and my mind for a big year,'' he said.
``I know the media will be coming, but that's part of it. That's
the media's job, and I understand. You guys have a tough job,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez continues to be the recipient of national exposure. The
list this season includes: ``USA Today, Sports Illustrated,
Baseball Weekly, ESPN Magazine, Los Angeles Times, New York Post''
and ``CNN-SI''. He also has been the subject of feature stories by
almost every local newspaper when the Rangers stop in an opposing
city.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez complies with the requests, but he does not relish all
the attention, said Luis Mayoral, the Rangers' Latin American
liaison and Gonzalez's confidant.
</P>
<P>
   ``He doesn't want to be put on a stage with Mark McGwire, Ken
Griffey Jr., Frank Thomas and Albert Belle,'' Mayoral said. ``He'd
rather do his thing on the field. That's his nature. That's his
makeup.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has performed well in the media spotlight. He thrived
in the 1996 playoffs against the New York Yankees, batting .438
(7-for-16) with five home runs and nine RBI in four games.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's more mature,'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``He's
got a better grasp of the English language, and he's more
comfortable speaking in public. That series was a coming-out party
for him. It was national exposure big time, and he handled it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the only guy doing anything offensively, and people
wanted him,'' recalled John Blake, the Rangers' vice president for
public relations. ``He handled it well. He was as good in defeat as
he was after we won Game 1. I got a lot of compliments from the
national and New York media in terms of Juan making himself
available and answering their questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good national spotlight for him, and he came through
it well. I couldn't ask for a guy to handle the postseason any
better than he did. I think that was a turning point for him in
that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, though, do have a plan in place should a media
crush befall Gonzalez this season. It will resemble the plan the
Cardinals put in place for McGwire, who remains on pace to break
Maris' single-season record for home runs (61).
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals make McGwire available for a 30-minute session
with the media 3 1/2 hours before the first game of each road
series with no other pregame availability during the series.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to make it as easy as you can for the individual, and
that's what we'll do,'' Blake said. ``You want to be cooperative,
but it can become a distraction. I think Juan understands how
important it is, and I think he's been very cooperative.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CROMWELL, Conn. _ This was the type of day it was in Saturday's
third round of the Greater Hartford Open at the TPC at River
Highlands.
</P>
<P>
   Donnie Hammond walked to the 17th tee staring at a 59, hit three
balls into the water on the 441-yard par-4 hole, and took a 10.
Doug Tewell had a share of the lead walking to the 17th tee, and
he, too, found water, ended up with a double bogey, and finished
with a bogey on 18. Hammond and Tewell disappeared from sight, and
there was no shortage of players ready to step up.
</P>
<P>
   When the round began in warm, humid conditions, there were 12
players within three shots of Scott Gump's lead and as the round
wore on it became even more congested atop the leaderboard. When it
ended, Scott Hoch (64), Larry Mize (66), and New Zealander Grant
Waite (65) were tied for the lead at 13-under-par 197. The
threesome of Olin Browne (66), defender Stewart Cink (67), and
Tewell (68) were two astern.
</P>
<P>
   Waite played the incoming nine in 30 strokes to surge into
contention. Mize started with 10 straight pars before playing the
last eight holes 4 under par. Hoch birdied the 18th hole to join
the parade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel I'm playing well,'' said Hoch. ``I can't say I ever go
into into a tournament and say, `This is my tournament.' I remember
one time I felt very confident, went in there, and got beat to
death.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoch started his round by holing a 40-foot birdie putt on the
first hole and followed up by hitting a sand wedge to 5 feet for a
second birdie. After a solitary bogey on the sixth, when he said he
``hit it all over the place,'' Hoch birdied the eighth with a
25-foot putt, the 10th with a 25-foot birdie putt from the fringe,
the 13th (sand wedge, 1 foot), 15th (two putts from 45 feet), and
the 18th, when he hit an 8-iron second shot to 8 feet.
</P>
<P>
   Waite, who still calls North Palmerston on the southern tip of
New Zealand's north island home, started his run with birdies on
the 11th, when he holed out of a bunker, and on the 12th, when he
hit an 8-iron to 6 feet. He picked up steam with a birdie on the
15th when he drove into a greenside bunker and blasted out to
within 1 inch. He followed that with birdies on the 16th, where he
sank a putt from the back fringe, and the 17th (8-iron, 8 feet) to
put him in position for his second PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   David Duval, who has been on a streak since he won the last
three tournaments of 1997, started with a 15-foot birdie putt on
the first hole. He followed with birdies on the fourth (6-iron, 30
feet), 13th (two putts, 20 feet), and 15th (chip, 1 inch), and had
no bogeys.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been fortunate in the last several months to win leading,
win coming from behind, and win tied,'' said Duval. ``The little
bit of pressure might be more on you if you're leading. I'm looking
forward to it.''
</P>
<P>
   He has a good track record at the course, leads the PGA money
list, and was just one of three of the first 13 money winners to
show up.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm putting actually quite well,'' said Duval. ``I
think I'm going to have to put the ball a little closer to the hole
to have a chance. I haven't made a whole lot of birdies this week.
It's a little surprising no one has been able to get way ahead. It
seems everybody shot the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Mize birdied the 11th (8-iron, 10 feet), 13th (pitching wedge, 5
feet), 15th (pitching wedge, 3 feet) and 16th (5-iron, 10 feet) to
get in contention for his first victory since the 1993 Northern
Telecom Open. He was paired with Waite.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `We couldn't seem to get anything going on the
front.' We've both played enough to know you have to be patient,''
Mize said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just want to give yourself a chance for tomorrow. I made a
nice putt to save par on the third hole. You really don't want to
lose one early in the day. I hit a nice chip on seven and the rest
of it was pretty routine. I had a good birdie putt at 18 and just
read it terrible. I played solidly today and it continued to give
confidence. I'm looking forward to tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Browne, who has New England roots and has played a lot of golf
at The Country Club, stormed into the picture with a 32 going out.
He stumbled with a three-putt bogey-7 on the 10th, but birdied the
13th by sinking a 1-foot putt and the 14th with a putt from inside
4 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like playing in New England,'' Browne said. ``I putted
better this week than I've putted in a while. It's given me some
confidence on the greens. It's taken a lot of the pressure off my
iron game. Tomorrow? Just try to post as low a score as I can and
see where it adds up. It doesn't matter until the last four or five
tomorrow. Something clicked, and when it does you ride it for as
long as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Andrade of Bristol, R.I., who held the course-record 62
that was matched Saturday by Gump, finished on 66_203 and is
enjoying his best tournament since the first of the year in
Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been very frustrating the last three of four months,''
said Andrade. ``I haven't putted well, and if you don't putt well
out here you're going to struggle. When you're not putting well it
puts so much pressure on the rest of your game.''

D-BACKS PRINT OUT VICTORY OVER ASTROS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DON KETCHUM  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Buck Showalter doesn't have a plastic pen holder in
his shirt pocket or wear thick black-rimmed glasses with a piece of
white tape wrapped around the middle. He does, however,
occasionally display tendencies of a computer geek.
</P>
<P>
   According to Showalter's printout, catcher Kelly Stinnett was
3-for-3 and shortstop Jay Bell was 8-for-13 against left-hander
Mike Hampton, Saturday night's starting pitcher for the Houston
Astros.
</P>
<P>
   There were no short-circuits to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett doubled and hit a solo home run and Bell collected a
pair of hits against Hampton. Meanwhile, left-hander Brian
Anderson, the Diamondbacks' starter, gave up two runs, scattered
nine hits and didn't walk a batter as Arizona turned back the
Astros, 7-4, at the Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   With today's finale of the three-game series remaining before
the All-Star break, the Diamondbacks have reached the 30-victory
plateau (30-57). Houston fell to 52-34.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kelly and Jay did their jobs, and we also were lucky to catch
Hampton on an off-night,'' Showalter said.
</P>
<P>
   Hampton (8-4), activated on Saturday after being on the disabled
list with a pulled groin, gave up 10 hits, walked three and six
runs (three earned) in 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson raised his record to 6-7, all of the victories coming
on the road. He continued his pattern of being one of the stingiest
in allowing walks in the National League. Also one of the most
charitable in terms of giving up home runs, he kept the ball in the
yard Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   `` `Andy' was outstanding. He got a couple of key double-play
balls (in the fifth and seventh innings) and the no walks were
big,'' Showalter said. ``As well as the Astros hit, you don't want
to put any more guys on and give them any more chances than you
have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Anderson: ``I was pretty happy with my stuff. My change-ups
were working pretty well. The only real hard-hit ball was the one
David Dellucci caught (a lunging grab in deep right-center off the
bat of Carl Everett to begin the second). I'm just happy to get a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona scored first in the second inning when Stinnett led off
with a double down the left-field line and later came home on a
double-play grounder by Yamil Benitez (no RBI).
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci's play against Everett was key, because Sean Berry, the
next hitter, connected for a drive in the same area, except that it
went farther and Berry ended up with a triple. It would have easily
scored Everett. Berry did, however, score on Brad Ausmus' sacrifice
fly to tie it at 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Diamondbacks jumped back in front, 2-1, in the third. Andy
Fox, starting at third in place of the injured Matt Williams
(bruised left foot), doubled to lead off and scored on a one-out
single to center by Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The three unearned runs off Hampton came in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
   Dellucci led off with his second straight hit on the first
pitch. With one out, Danny Klassen, called up from Triple-A Tucson
late Friday night and making his debut at second base, walked.
Anderson laid down an attempted sacrifice bunt in front of the
plate. Hampton turned and fired to third in an attempt to get
Dellucci, but Berry missed the ball and Dellucci scored. Klassen
came home on a groundout by Fox and Anderson scored on a single by
Devon White.
</P>
<P>
   Stinnett led off the fifth with his seventh homer of the season
to make it 6-1. Ricky Gutierrez's RBI single in the bottom of the
fifth cut Arizona's lead to 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Showalter elected to bring in right-hander Bobby Chouinard in
the eighth inning, and he gave up an RBI double to Moises Alou to
make it 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Fox walked to lead off the ninth against Houston reliever C.J.
Nitowski and scored on White's double to center field to make it
7-3.
</P>
<P>
   Closer Gregg Olson came on in the ninth with no save situation
and struggled a bit, giving up a leadoff walk to Brad Ausmus and an
RBI single to Craig Biggio, but got Derek Bell on a foul to Lee to
end it. &QL;

ASTROS MAN AGER GOT A CALL FROM ON HIGH 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON - Larry Dierker made a bold career move rarely seen in
sports. Last year he left the comfort and security of the radio/TV
booth to become manager of the Houston Astros.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, one day you're sitting behind a pressbox mike, wearing
a Hawaiian shirt, saying things like, ``Hi, everybody!'' and ``Oh,
those bases on balls.``
</P>
<P>
   Next day you're in uniform, staring out at the field, teeth
clenched, contemplating a suicide squeeze.
</P>
<P>
   Knowing habits are to break, one wonders whether Dierker,
perhaps without even realizing it, still mentally broadcasts every
game.
</P>
<P>
   `` ``Well, that's gotta be it for Hampton. The lef''t-``hander's
tired. Look'' ``for Dierk to make a change. In fact, here I
come'',''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-4 skipper ambled out of the Houston dugout in the
fifth inning of the Diamondbacks' 7-4 victory. Before he reached
the mound his starting pitcher, Mike Hampton, eyes averted, flipped
him the ball and walked dejectedly toward the bench, head bowed.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven D-Backs' hits. A fireworks show. Three doubles. A triple.
When Kelly Stinnett homered to lead off the fifth inning Houston
leftfielder Moises Alou didn't move a step. Why bother? The ball
was long gone, and he knew it.
</P>
<P>
   This wasn't how Dierker and the Astros had hoped to celebrate
our nation's independence on Stars and Stripes T-Shirt Night at the
Astrodome.
</P>
<P>
   If the Astros were surprised they lost, it is understandable.
</P>
<P>
   Under Dierker's gentle whip, the Astros (52-34) have opened a
five-game lead in the National League Central. Houston is one of
the hottest hitting teams in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Going into the ninth, down by four runs, the home team still
believed it could win. So did Dome fans who have come to expect
last-minute heroics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've come from behind so many times in late innings,''
Dierker said. ``I don't know if it's fate or destiny. But when
players experience that they start to think they're supposed to win
the championship.''
</P>
<P>
   It can't be easy managing a big-league team, especially with no
formal training. A manager must deal with large and fragile egos.
He must set the batting order and make roster moves and figure out
the double switch. Billy Martin said the key to surviving as a
manager involves ``keeping the five players who hate you away from
the five who are undecided.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dierker has kept his team happy. He is happy, too. The
first thing you notice is his easy smile. He smiles more than Buck
Showalter. Of course, so does the minted likeness of George
Washington on a quarter-dollar coin.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker brought his breezy, laid-back style as a broadcaster to
the dugout. Those who know him well say the manager is as
comfortable in his job as he is sitting on a stool sipping a tall
fruit drink at the Big Bamboo Lounge, an ersatz tiki hut, at the
Astros training camp in Kissimmee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is patient, especially with his pitchers. He was a
pitcher himself once, one of Houston's best ever. A bonus baby, as
young stars once were called, Dierker struck out Willie Mays in
Larry's first big-league inning on his 18th birthday. He was the
Astros first 20-game winner.
</P>
<P>
   Most manager go by The Book (if you ever see a copy let me
know). Dierker manages more on instinct. He can relate with former
big-league manager Bobby Bragan, who once said, ``Say you were
standing with one foot in the oven and one foot in an ice bucket.
According to people who believe in (playing) percentages, you
should be perfectly comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker is, for now. Know what the biggest adjustment he said he
faced in his new job? Depth perception.
</P>
<P>
   ``You really can't see the field very well from the dugout,''
Dierker said. ``I'd forgotten how bad it was. I remember when I
went upstairs (to the booth) for the first time. I thought every
fly ball was going out of the ballpark.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker would take exception with those who say he is making
managing look easy, this loss a case in point. But he is breaking
ground. Until Dierker came along, an owner would no more select a
broadcaster for his manager than he would pick a sportswriter,
although most of my colleagues are Deep Thinkers who, had they
chosen baseball over journalism, probably could have become
All-Stars or even Hall of Famers, if not for a lack of talent. &QL;

GONZALEZ HACKING WAY TOWARD RECORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez, also known as ``Igor'' because of his massive
physical stature, towers over almost everyone in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all his exploits, the 6-foot-3 Gonzalez has remained the
American League's unknown superstar, despite being named league
Most Valuable Player two years ago and twice leading the majors in
home runs.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Mark McGwire, Sammy Sosa and Ken Griffey's home run
chase of Roger Maris that has captured the attention of America's
baseball fans.
</P>
<P>
   Few realize that Texas' Gonzalez is on pace to break Hack
Wilson's single-season RBI record of 190, a more difficult
accomplishment in the eyes of some.
</P>
<P>
   With one game remaining before the All-Star break, Gonzalez has
already reached 96 RBIs. He's trying to match Detroit's Hank
Greenberg (1935) as the only other player ever to reach 100 RBIs by
the break.
</P>
<P>
   Some stars play their entire career and are barely able to reach
100 RBIs in a season. With more than 2{ months to go, Gonzalez has
nearly reached the century mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even at 16, when he couldn't hit a home run, he always had a
knack for picking up the runners on base,'' said Diamondbacks
Assistant General Manager Sandy Johnson, who signed Gonzalez when
he was working with the Rangers in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's part of his makeup. I remember, he was gangly, like a
young colt. From the moment he signed, he was destined to be a
superstar in his mind. If I had known he was going to be this good,
I would have given him more money. His batting stance has never
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   It's that batting stance, in which Gonzalez holds the bat high
over his shoulders and stands almost erect, that opposing pitchers
hate to see in the batter's box, especially with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, who won't turn 29 until Oct. 16 and probably hasn't
reached his peak yet, entered Saturday's action having played 1,035
games and had 886 career RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   As ridiculous as it sounds, that's one RBI every 1.17 games he's
played as a major leaguer.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the best RBI guy I've ever played with,'' said Rangers
first baseman Will Clark. ``He constantly proves you don't have to
have the ball over the middle of the plate in order to handle it.
He's a great bad-ball hitter.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has had difficulties handling snubs, from within the
game and outside. As proof he offers the fact that Tuesday will
mark only the second time he's ever been to an All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what I have to do to get more attention,''
Gonzalez said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez's mostly quiet demeanor, especially when he's in
crowds, hasn't helped elevate his stature nationally. By most
accounts from the people closest to him, Gonzalez is somewhat
introverted when he's near people he does not know.
</P>
<P>
   In the past two years, however, Gonzalez has started to break
out of his shell. Part of his more outgoing personality is derived
from the personal coming out party he had during the 1996 AL
playoffs, when he hit five home runs, had nine RBIs and hit .438 in
a Division Series loss to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all accelerated in the '96 playoffs when he was under the
spotlight,'' Texas Manager Johnny Oates said. ``He had the great
series, and there were a lot of interviews. He really had no
choice. I thought he handled himself very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But probably the biggest reason Gonzalez is more outgoing these
days are his regular sessions with a psychologist, which began
before last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had read where Mark McGwire said he improved as a ballplayer
after he started seeing a professional,'' Gonzalez said. ``We're
human beings, not machines. I'll do anything to help me get better
on the field and off.
</P>
<P>
   ``More than anything it's helped me organize my time,
particularly before and after games. I used to throw away my time.
Now I have more time for the important things in life. I'm a happy
person. I spend more time with my two children and my wife.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a minor miracle for Gonzalez, married to his third wife, a
salsa singer who, like him, is from Puerto Rico, to freely admit he
has sought professional help.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Latin culture is very macho, and admitting this is not the
thing to do,'' Gonzalez said. ``But I don't care because I know I'm
not crazy. There's nothing wrong with it. If you break a bone, you
see a doctor. This is no different.''
</P>
<P>
   The phrase most commonly associated with Gonzalez these days, at
least from those who know him best, is how mature he has become in
recent years, which Gonzalez attributes to the psychological help
he has received.
</P>
<P>
   ``He treats baseball like the game that it is,'' said teammates
and fellow Puerto Rican Ivan Rodriguez, who will also join Gonzalez
at Tuesday's All-Star Game. ``He doesn't put as much pressure on
himself as a few years ago. He's more mature. He's someone strong
who can break down the walls of stereotypes of Latins. He's happier
and more talkative. Of course he can reach the RBI record. Just
watch out he doesn't reach 200.'' &QL;

ABOUT TIME FOR TKACHUK TO GROW UP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - So this is his home. This is his team. This is where
he wants to be.
</P>
<P>
   Which, of course, explains why Keith Tkachuk is off in Cape Cod,
stewing over broken promises, convinced he's part of a Winnipeg
purge, ready to throw the Coyotes in reverse with another sit-down
strike.
</P>
<P>
   So there are captains, there are leaders and there are guys like
Tkachuk. Guys who must get theirs, guys who never see the big
picture, guys who forget their names already rest on binding
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   A little advice for one of the most divisive, self-centered
captains to have never won a playoff series: Come down off your
number before it's too late.
</P>
<P>
   When General Manager Bobby Smith yanked a $33.3 million offer
from the table, followed by a bold yet ominous $17 million
acquisition of Jyrki Lumme, the ending may have already been
written. And soon, you will know a lot about the priorities of this
hockey team.
</P>
<P>
   If the right names are involved, it's a slam dunk. The Coyotes
should trade Tkachuk right now, end a bad marriage, build around a
winning nucleus. Problem is, there are only a handful of teams
willing to pay the shipping costs, and they know what's going on
here. They know Tkachuk's baggage, they smell desperation, they
realize he might be obtainable for Pat Garrity and Bubba Wells.
</P>
<P>
   Trading Tkachuk is fine, but giving him away would be idiotic.
To call his bluff and let another season erode in controversy would
be unforgivable. And to end all talks would confirm what a few
players already are whispering about this organization, that it is
too cheap to win a Stanley Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: If the right names aren't whispered in Smith's ear
very soon, there should be room for movement. And most of it should
come from Tkachuk, who should fire his agent and realize his lack
of leverage.
</P>
<P>
   Tkachuk is surely underpaid, chained to a contract that will pay
him $5.8 million over the next two seasons. But he is conveniently
forgetting the $6 million check he cashed when the Jets matched an
offer sheet in 1995. And with the NHL restructuring the face of its
game, enacting rules to put the premium back on skating, the impact
of your physical, lumbering power forwards is sure to diminish.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Smith stretched the truth when he broke off negotiations,
angry that Tkachuk balked at an ``outstanding offer'' that would
raise his annual salary $6.5 million over the next five years.
Well, sorry.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Gilmour and Brett Hull signed for three years at $18
million and $17 million, respectively. And then there's Eric
Lindros, extended for one year at $8.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eric Lindros sets the market for Eric Lindros,'' Smith said
tersely, telling you what he thinks about that comparison.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Tkachuk is not Lindros, and we have postseason results
to prove it. He is no Jaromir Jagr or Teemu Selanne, guys who
successfully negotiated new deals with two years left on their
contracts. But if the Coyotes wanted to be fair, they'd give him
Mike Modano money. Seven million per season. And if they really
wanted to test Tkachuk's will to win, dangle a big chunk up front,
a Sergei Fedorov bonus where the incentive rests with the success
of the team, not the man.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tkachuk and Smith are no longer talking to each other.
Tkachuk thinks Smith broke a promise. Smith claims he only vowed to
``roll up his sleeves'' and work toward a compromise. Neither man
has done his part, and the longer this goes, the lies will turn to
war. And the more likely next season will look just like last
season _ a team fueled by poisonous chemistry, staggering along
without all hands on board, destined to end up in disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   Great leaders think about their team every so often, and this is
where Tkachuk is all words and little action. He needs to grow up,
forget about the money and win something.
</P>
<P>
   And so do the Coyotes, a team that better have the right motives
and right return if they say good-bye to the captain that never
was. &QL;

RERUN PUTS MERCURY IN SAME ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAUL CORO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTE, N.C. _ For those of you who missed the first
Charlotte-Phoenix meeting at America West Arena, the teams
re-enacted the plot Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Same blown big lead by the Mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Same impossible shot from Charlotte's Christy Smith for her
first points and a lead in the waning seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Same available Mercury timeout ignored for a final shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same old thing,'' Phoenix guard Bridget Pettis summarized.
</P>
<P>
   Just like the 72-71 loss two weeks ago, the Mercury was stung
again when it seemed to have an opponent outmatched. This time,
Charlotte overcame an 18-point deficit to win, 68-66, in front of
8,210 at Charlotte Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   As opposed to the 11-point lead the Sting erased in the last
6:25 at Phoenix, Charlotte (8-2) cleared off an 18-point deficit by
the first minute of the second half Saturday with a 21-3 run.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix (7-3) got down by as many as seven in the second half
and trailed, 62-56, with 4:10 remaining as Jennifer Gillom sat on
the bench with an ankle sprain.
</P>
<P>
   That is when Umeki Webb's play at both ends and Michelle Timms'
passing nearly rescued the Mercury. The pair accounted for
Phoenix's last 10 points, starting with a 8-0 comeback that
included Gillom's re-entry. Webb scored six of the last 10, giving
Phoenix a lead twice.
</P>
<P>
   Her steal and layup put the Mercury ahead, 64-62, with 2:19 to
go. When Charlotte's Andrea Stinson hit an off-balance jumper to
tie the score, Webb came back with a bucket from the post for a
66-64 lead with 1:50 to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shouldn't have even been that close,'' said Webb, the
former North Carolina State star who thrilled 19 friends in
attendance with a 15-point, four-steal game.
</P>
<P>
   Stinson hit another running jumper to knot the score at 66 with
1:15 to go, and Charlotte got the ball back after Timms misfired a
jumper and Pettis missed her 10th straight shot on the put-back.
</P>
<P>
   As the shot clock at one second, Smith sank a 12-foot leaner
with Timms draping her and 17.1 seconds remaining in the game. A
scoreless Smith also hit the same shot for Charlotte's first lead
at Phoenix with 20.3 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just threw it up and got lucky,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Timms said, ``That's as good a shot as anybody in the NBA would
make. We handed it to them. We got a comfortable lead and sat back
and did exactly the same thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom missed a fadeaway, the shot that gave her most of her
game-high 21 points, with nine seconds to go. Needing two fouls to
get to the bonus, Phoenix sent Smith to the free throw line with
2.7 seconds to go.
</P>
<P>
   She missed both. Webb rebounded the second and threw the ball to
Pettis, whose 30-footer was after the buzzer and short anyway. The
Mercury had a 20-second timeout remaining.
</P>
<P>
   In the home loss to Charlotte, Tracy Reid hit the go-ahead shot
with 2.4 seconds remaining, and Phoenix inbounded for a desperation
shot instead of calling a timeout.
</P>
<P>
   Mercury Coach Cheryl Miller said a timeout would not have
helped.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a blatant lack of calls by officials
during the stretch than what happened down the stretch,'' Miller
said. ``We didn't do some things in the first half, but by no
stretch of the imagination did the best team win.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillom came out shooting as well as in Thursday's victory at
Cleveland, scoring nine of Phoenix's first 14 points. Charlotte
looked like it did in its last game too, carrying over that 24.6
percent shooting night into a 1-for-11 start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to believe we lost this one,'' Gillom said. &QL;

NO-TRADE CLAUSE KEY TO LUMME DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the main reasons  &UR; Jyrki Lumme ruled out returning to the
Vancouver Canucks, his team for the past eight seasons, was because
of the lack of security.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the lack of a no-trade clause. That's why the
highly sought after defenseman rejected the Canucks' multiyear
offer last season that would have paid him an average of $2.7
million a year.
</P>
<P>
   It's also why he passed on several other teams that were in
pursuit of the unrestricted free agent last week, including
Toronto, San Jose, Calgary and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   But he got what he wanted, and more, with the Coyotes. In
addition to signing a five-year deal Friday worth $17 million,
Lumme received a no-trade clause, which more star players are
seeking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we gave him a no-trade clause, but it's only in existence
for the first three years of the deal,'' Coyotes General Manager
 &UR; Bobby
 &UR; Smith said. ``After the third year, we could trade him, but only to
one of 10 teams that have been designated.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as Lumme liked living in Vancouver, it's doubtful the
Canucks are one of those clubs. Vancouver probably had the most
disappointing season of any club last season, finishing last in the
Western Conference with a 25-43-14 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``For sure, it was pretty tough,'' Lumme said. ``We had such
high expectations and then we just totally crashed. For some
reason, we just didn't click. We had no fight. We were never on the
same page. But that's the past. That chapter of my life is over.'' &QL; 
Canadian grit &QL; 
Last week at the NHL draft in Buffalo, the longest pause came when
Toronto was scheduled to pick No. 8 overall. After several minutes,
the Maple Leafs announced they were swapping picks with Chicago,
trading down to get the No. 10 pick.
</P>
<P>
   What was the holdup about?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Toronto was all set to grab center  &UR; Mark Bell of St.
Paul, Ontario. But word leaked about his appearance a few days
earlier on The Sports Network's ``Off the Record'' program, in
which Bell said he liked to give European players ``a little
extra'' when he hit them because they're ``taking away jobs from
good Canadian players.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, comments like that might endear a player to
management. But the Maple Leafs and  &UR; Mike Smith, &UR; associate general
manager, are famous for drafting European players.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto then swapped with Chicago and took  &UR; Nikolai Antropov
from Russia. &QL; 
McLeod's mystery movie &QL; 
When someone told  &UR; Doug McLeod that the producers of an upcoming
motion picture were looking for a hockey broadcaster for a bit
part, the television voice for the Coyotes, on a lark, sent in a
demo clip.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, he found himself being whisked away to Los
Angeles and winning the role in the upcoming film ``Mystery,
Alaska,'' due out in February. The movie, which stars  &UR; Burt
Reynolds and  &UR; Mike Myers, is based on a hockey game between the New
York Rangers and a group of locals in the small town of Mystery.
</P>
<P>
   McLeod's partner in the broadcast booth was Hall of Famer  &UR; Phil
 &UR; Esposito, general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``On our way to one of the shoots, Phil leaned over and asked me
how I thought  &UR; Craig Janney would look in a Tampa Bay jersey,''
McLeod said. ``Funny, I didn't think anything about it at the
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Three days later, the Coyotes sent Janney to Tampa for a
fifth-round draft pick and  &UR; Louie DeBrusk. &QL; 
Duck hunting &QL; 
The Mighty Ducks of Anaheim are close to naming a new head coach to
replace recently fired  &UR; Pierre Page. Two of the candidates
reportedly on the team's short list are former coaches, Chicago's
 &UR; Craig Hartsburg and Buffalo's  &UR; Ted Nolan.
</P>
<P>
   Nolan won the Jack Adams Award two years ago as the league's top
coach, then was unceremoniously dumped.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, former Coyotes Coach  &UR; Don Hay was relieved of his
duties as an assistant in Anaheim. Hay recently accepted the head
coaching job with the Western Hockey League's Tri-City Americans,
where he also will serve as general manager.
</P>
<P>
   His son,  &UR; Darryl, is a defenseman on the team. &QL; 
Slap shots &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sources in Vancouver say the Canucks would be interested in
trading star right wing  &UR; Pavel Bure to Phoenix for disgruntled left
wing  &UR; Keith
 &UR; Tkachuk. Bure definitely wants out, but the Coyotes likely would
want more in return.
</P>
<P>
   Another source close to the Coyotes said Smith turned down an
offer from Philadelphia GM  &UR; Bob Clarke regarding a straight-up swap
of Tkachuk for star center  &UR; Eric Lindros. Which player would you
rather have?
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that all major moves in free agency thus far have
involved Western Conference teams. Besides the Coyotes landing a
star in Lumme, Dallas signed St. Louis sniper  &UR; Brett Hull and
Chicago signed New Jersey center  &UR; Doug Gilmour. Detroit, meanwhile,
is said to be close to reeling in defenseman  &UR; Uwe Krupp.
</P>
<P>
   The East won't be far behind, though. Philadelphia is hot after
Rangers goalie  &UR; Mike Richter. The Rangers are eyeing Edmonton
goalie
 &UR; Curtis Joseph. And Carolina has offered a deal to Pittsburgh center
 &UR; Ron Francis, who starred for the club when it was in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it was destiny that Detroit's  &UR; Steve Yzerman won the
Conn Smythe Trophy as the Most Valuable Player in the Stanley Cup
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   During the playoffs, Yzerman bought a summer cottage that once
belonged to the man the trophy is named for.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me before the playoffs he was eyeing this cottage and
then he said he bought it. I just thought, `Wouldn't that be
good?'' teammate  &UR; Brendan Shanahan said. &QL;

CARDINALS ROOKIE HITTING QBS ALREADY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Add courage to the list of Cardinals rookie defensive lineman
 &UR; Andre
 &UR; Wadsworth's many attributes.
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth asked probable future Hall of Fame quarterback  &UR; John
Elway of the Denver Broncos a potentially embarrassing question at
last week's NFL rookie symposium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm saving this question for someone who couldn't stand up,''
Wadsworth told Elway. ``He has been hurting since he was about 14
years old. In 1988, when Denver played San Francisco in the Super
Bowl, there was a little kid with a big Afro, and he went up to
(Elway) for his autograph, and he didn't get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just gave him a look and walked on by. To this day, he
wants your autograph.''
</P>
<P>
   Wadsworth, the third overall pick in April's draft, was
referring to
 &UR; Corey Chavous, the Vanderbilt defensive back picked in the second
round by the Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Elway had just finished telling rookies how they should go out
of their way to be nice to fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did I tell you? They never forget,'' Elway told the
rookies. ``That was the one time. I hope he didn't ask right after
the game. When you get beat, 55-10, in the Super Bowl, it's not a
good feeling.'' &QL; 
Send in the clowns &QL; 
Here's how absurd the search for a new owner of the Minnesota
Vikings was: The ``Pro Wrestling Torch'' offered World Wrestling
Federation promoter and owner  &UR; Vince McMahon as a candidate.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Red McCombs, former owner of the San Antonio Spurs and Denver
Nuggets of the NBA, beat out another NBA owner, Timberwolves'  &UR; Glen
Taylor, among others for the right to buy the team with a bid of
more than $200 million. League officials are expected to approve
the deal this month.
</P>
<P>
   Approval is expected to be contingent on the team's remaining in
Minnesota. Yet concern has surfaced over whether McCombs, a San
Antonio resident who is worth close to $1 billion, could move the
team to the south Texas city's Alamodome.
</P>
<P>
   McMahon entered the picture after Las Vegas resident  &UR; Shruti
Misra, who owns little more than a 4.6-acre vacant lot, offered to
pay $225 million for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Misra, and her husband,  &UR; Anil Gupta, have been the subject of
numerous lawsuits, and Gupta declared bankruptcy last year,
according to the ``Las Vegas Sun.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``Sun'' reported that Gupta was not able to make bail when
he was arrested in 1994 in a questionable real estate transaction.
</P>
<P>
   The paper also reported that the pair have been accused of
duping a blind, 74-year-old woman into paying for a newspaper ad
that proclaimed the couple's wealth. Gupta and Misra promised to
donate $5.1 million to Active Blind and Visually Impaired of Nevada
but donated only worthless railroad bonds and unconfirmed real
estate holdings, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't offer any of the $2.4 billion in gold, silver and
platinum they claim to have stored in a Las Vegas warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   Fort Knox is the only facility to have such a collection, gold
experts said. &QL; 
Family feud &QL; 
The war for control of the San Francisco 49ers could be settled by
Commissioner  &UR; Paul Tagliabue.
</P>
<P>
   Attorneys for former 49ers owner  &UR; Eddie DeBartolo and his
sister,
 &UR; Denise DeBartolo York, met with Tagliabue on Wednesday. Both sides
want to run the team.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo signed an agreement in December that gave his sister
control of the team after reports surfaced that he would be
indicted in a Louisiana gambling investigation.
</P>
<P>
   DeBartolo has reneged on that agreement and claims the case
against him in Louisiana is flimsy.
</P>
<P>
   His sister maintains that the agreement with DeBartolo is valid.
</P>
<P>
   If Tagliabue sides with DeBartolo, he could regain control of
the team once his legal problems in Louisiana are done. DeBartolo
likely would fire club president  &UR; Carmen Policy, his onetime close
friend who has been running the team for DeBartolo's sister. &QL; 
Bad timing &QL; 
Miami Dolphins running back  &UR; Lawrence Philips, being investigated
in Plantation, Fla., for allegedly assaulting a woman who refused
to dance with him, could become the first player to be disciplined
as part of the new anti-violence rule.
</P>
<P>
   The policy went into effect Wednesday, one day after Plantation
police announced they were investigating Phillips, the former
Nebraska star.
</P>
<P>
   Any league employee who is charged with a violent crime is
subjected to a fine or suspension without pay at the discretion of
Tagliabue. A second conviction could result in banishment. &QL; 
Short shots &QL; 
New York Giants Coach  &UR; Jim Fassel, the former Cardinals offensive
coordinator, is miffed that linebacker  &UR; Corey Miller attended only
three of 12 off-season workouts. ``I'm not happy that I didn't hear
from him,'' Fassel said. ``I have an answering machine 24 hours a
day. He's looking at the wrong guy if he's playing a game of
chicken.''
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore punter  &UR; Greg Montgomery is recovering from a sprained
toe suffered while punting for a team promotional video. He kicked
the camera that was filming him. &QL;

TEEN OFFERS WORM'S-EYE VIEW OF RODMAN'S MANY ACTIVITIES
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Sixteen-year-old Wesley Tacker has a Bull's eye on Dennis
Rodman's every move at Tacker's site, The Worm's World
(www.wesjen.simplenet.com/rodman).
</P>
<P>
   Tacker, a junior-to-be at Abilene High School, closely tracks
Rodman's every step _ a good thing considering the former South Oak
Cliff High School student might leave the Chicago Bulls for another
NBA team at any time.
</P>
<P>
   It's like having a Doppler radar system fixed on Rodman. One
night Rodman might be on ESPN, the next on the ``Tonight Show''.
Another night he's wrestling on TNT. Tacker documents it all on his
site.
</P>

   ``I actually have the only site on the Internet that offers
up-to-date Dennis Rodman news,'' Tacker said.

   While the authors of some Rodman fan sites try, few fans seem as
dedicated as Tacker, who also writes a weekly editorial and plays
host to a weekly chat at Rodman's official site on America Online
Athlete Direct (keyword: worm).
</P>
<P>
   Tacker started the site in April 1997 as The Dennis Rodman
Current Events Page. When Tacker ran out of space on his Internet
service provider, he moved to another with more room and renamed
the site.
</P>
<P>
   While most Rodman pages focus on only basketball images,
Tacker's gallery contains numerous images on the marketing world of
Dennis Rodman, which includes TV appearances, merchandise,
advertisements and articles.
</P>
<P>
   During the NBA season, Tacker tracks Rodman's statistics. The
site also includes a bi-weekly survey, message board, links page,
chat room, chat transcripts, top-10 lists and archives of all
Rodman updates.
</P>
<P>
   Rodman fans, especially those who want to stay one step ahead of
their unpredictable anti-hero, should check it out.

ERSTAD, MCGWIRE LOOK LIKE MVPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PEDRO GOMEZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's the traditional midway point of the season. With that in
mind, it's time to take a look at which players are distinguishing
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Submitted, for your approval, are the half-way awards: &QL; 
 &UR; AMERICAN LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MVP: He may not be the sexiest candidate, but Anaheim's  &UR; Darin
Erstad is playing like a future Hall of Famer. When it comes to the
total package, the unselfish Erstad, who has played all three
outfield spots and first base, is the clear choice. Of course,
Texas'  &UR; Juan Gonzalez and Seattle's duo of  &UR; Ken Griffey Jr., and
 &UR; Alex Rodriguez could still have something to say. Too bad we can't
just nominate the entire Yankees roster.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cy Young: It's never been done before, but  &UR; Pedro Martinez, now
with Boston, looks like he could become the first pitcher to win
consecutive Cy Young Awards in separate leagues. Except for a
two-week bout with an intestinal infection, Martinez has been
virtually unhittable.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rookie: He came in with all the hype, and  &UR; Ben Grieve of
Oakland has done nothing but live up to his press clippings.
Detroit's  &UR; Matt
 &UR; Anderson looks like the real thing, but he may have been called up
too late to close the gap on Grieve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: Anaheim's  &UR; Terry Collins has done a phenomenal job,
but the vote here goes to  &UR; Joe Torre of the Yankees. Yes, he has
the greatest collection of talent in the league, but getting a
great collection of talent to play at a high level is much more
difficult than getting lower-rung players to overachieve.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comeback player: Oakland's  &UR; Rickey Henderson leads the majors
in stolen bases and, at age 39, appears to be turning back the
clock. At the very least, he's making a strong case to continue
playing next year. &QL; 
 &UR; NATIONAL LEAGUE
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MVP: Chicago's  &UR; Sammy Sosa? That's the easy pick right now. The
nod still goes to St. Louis'  &UR; Mark McGwire, the Herculean first
baseman who seems to have Roger Maris' single-season record well
within his cross hairs. Watch for  &UR; Andres Galarraga to make a
charge here.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Cy Young: What's new? Not much. Atlanta's  &UR; Greg Maddux rises
above everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rookie: It's a close call, but the Diamondbacks'  &UR; Travis Lee
gets the edge over Cubs right-hander  &UR; Kerry Wood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Manager: It's time to stop ignoring the job
broadcaster-turned-manager  &UR; Larry Dierker has done in Houston. He
has the Astros nearly 20 games above .500, and they continue to win
despite three starters on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Comeback player: He was buried so deep on the scrap heap that
 &UR; Gregg
 &UR; Olson had to practically beg for a chance to pitch in spring
training. The Diamondbacks, with little to lose, offered that
chance and now have an established closer on their hands. &QL; 
Please take that knife out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some very harsh quotes from fired Dodgers Manager  &UR; Bill Russell
came to light last week in the ``Long Beach Press-Telegram.''
Russell's comments were apparently made a few days before he and
General Manager
 &UR; Fred Claire were fired and supposedly were made during an
off-the-record conversation with the topic being  &UR; Tommy Lasorda.
</P>
<P>
   But columnist  &UR; Doug Krikorian decided the comments were fair
game once the housecleaning took place and wrote Russell's comments
in a column last week. Here are the highlights:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tommy's just killing me and Fred with the Fox people,''
Russell said. ``Fred knows it. I know it. And there's nothing we
can do about it. It's just tough to work under these conditions.
Tommy's just vicious when he wants something. He did the same sort
of thing when he was a coach under  &UR; Walter Alston and wanted
Alston's job. Tommy's been second-guessing me ever since I took
over for him. Why? I don't know. All I know is that we haven't
spoken for months.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Lasorda, known within baseball circles as one of the
biggest phonies in the game, denied everything.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's ridiculous,` he said. ``I haven't been in town that
much this season, and no way I've been campaigning for any job . .
. For him to make a statement like that, I don't understand. I
stayed completely away. I would never politic for either guy's job.
I didn't want anyone to get fired. But it happened, and we have to
go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Lasorda, who said he has attempted on countless occasions to
speak to Russell since the firings, delivered the eulogy for former
Dodgers GM
 &UR; Al Campanis at a small funeral home in Fullerton, Calif., a
ceremony at which Russell was one of the fewer than 100 people who
attended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone told me he was there, which I was glad to hear, but I
never saw him,'' Lasorda claimed. &QL; 
The swinging pendulum &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of the 30 NL All-Stars, 21 are 30 or older, including seven of
the eight starters elected by the fans. Only three NL All-Stars are
25 or younger. Now you get the idea of why it's called the senior
circuit.
</P>
<P>
   Over in the junior circuit, which many believe is the
up-and-coming league, only 12 All-Stars are 30 or older. Six AL
stars are 25 or younger, including shortstop  &UR; Alex Rodriguez. Of
the eight starting position players in the AL, five are under 30. &QL; 
An idea we'd vote for &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia pitcher  &UR; Curt Schilling came up with an outstanding
idea to help fix some of the snubs that take place every year when
it comes to the All-Star Game:
</P>
<P>
   Take away the rule that mandates that every club must be
represented by at least one player. It was fine when there were
eight or 12 clubs in each league, but with 16 NL clubs, it leaves
room for only 12 reserves (14 this year because of expanded
rosters).
</P>
<P>
   ``The other thing is, I think only the city hosting the game
should have to be represented by at least one player,'' Schilling
said. ``The fans from Paducah aren't going to watch because their
team's player is on the roster. They're going to watch  &UR; Ken Griffey
and  &UR; Mark McGwire and
 &UR; Barry Bonds just like everybody else. It's a very diplomatic
process. And maybe it shouldn't be.'' &QL;

NO KIDDING, KLASSEN GETS CALL 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Oh Danny boy, the bigs, the bigs are calling . . .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Danny Klassen could hardly believe when Tucson Sidewinders
Manager
 &UR; Chris Speier told him on Friday night that the Diamondbacks were
summoning him to the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen was called up after third baseman  &UR; Matt Williams fouled
a ball off his left foot Friday night against Houston. Klassen
arrived here about three hours before Saturday night's game and
Manager  &UR; Buck
 &UR; Showalter immediately scribbled his name into the starting lineup
at second base.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen looked up into the panels of the Astrodome roof and
handled a pop-up by Houston's  &UR; Craig Biggio for the game's first
out. He slid on the artificial turf to field a grounder by  &UR; Derek
Bell and threw him out by an eyelash for the final out of the third
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Klassen walked in his first three at-bats, scoring a run on the
second occasion as part of a three-run fourth inning.
</P>
<P>
   He also struck out once and in the field finished with four
putouts and six assists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I needed a plane to get here,'' a beaming
Klassen said before the game. ``I've read where people called up
for the first time say it's hard to explain how they feel. They're
exactly right. It is hard to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   The 22-year-old Klassen was selected from the Milwaukee Brewers
in the expansion draft. He had not played above Double-A before
this season. He played well at shortstop for the Diamondbacks in
spring training, then was moved to second base at Triple-A Tucson
about a month ago. He has a strong chance to become the club's
second baseman of the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transition has gone smoothly,'' Klassen said. ``I've had
great teachers. Chris (Speier) had to make the same move during his
career, so he's been showing me all about the different angles when
you're fielding the ball and trying to turn the double play, things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop  &UR; Jay Bell, who teamed with Klassen on one of the two
double plays, was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very good all-around athlete. It seems that he can play
almost anywhere,'' Bell said. &QL; 
Williams sits out &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After learning his foot X-rays were negative, Williams, who
walked very gingerly around the clubhouse, was limited to
pinch-hitting duty during the game. He struck out in the ninth.
 &UR; Andy
 &UR; Fox started at third in his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going to have to take it a day it a time and see
how it goes,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the All-Star break that begins Monday and the fact
that the Diamondbacks won't play again after today until Friday,
Williams might also sit out again today rather than risk a
re-injury. He has hit in 14 of his past 15 games. &QL; 
Scary situation &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The club received a scare before the game when  &UR; Julio Paula,
their primary batting practice pitcher, passed out and was taken to
the hospital for tests.
</P>
<P>
   Paula, who was a coach at the team's academy in the Dominican
Republic, was playing catch in the outfield with pitcher  &UR; Willie
Blair when he became ill. While walking toward the dugout, he felt
as if he were going to vomit but instead passed out. The hospital
tests proved negative. &QL;

JONES SPARKS GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA _ There was no second-guessing the coach. No veterans
complaining about playing time. There were also no Germans,
Iranians or Yugoslavians _ just the cheer of a Fourth of July crowd
and of course the sight of the Kansas City Wizards to let Cobi
Jones know he's finally cleared customs.
</P>
<P>
   (begin ital)Au revoir(end ital), France. No. 13 is back.
</P>
<P>
   Jones, the most celebrated American player, left the disaster of
the United States' World Cup performance behind and got back to
business Saturday with the Galaxy in front of a season-high 53,655
at the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Jones played every minute of the three U.S. losses in the World
Cup, but all he needed was a Galaxy jersey to feel what it was like
to win in a 2-0 victory over the Wizards.
</P>
<P>
   The return of Jones, paired with Mexican striker Carlos
Hermosillo on the front line, left out Welton, Major League
Soccer's leading scorer with 33 points. That was the only
controversy in an otherwise normal Galaxy game as the team won its
fourth straight to improve to 15-2 on the season. Kansas City
dropped to 7-10.
</P>
<P>
   When Jones left for the national team, he had a league-high 23
points. He picked up right where he left off, turning a 1-0 Galaxy
lead into a comfortable 2-0 cushion.
</P>
<P>
   Jones started up the left side in the 67th minute, dropping the
ball off for Martin Machon. Machon curled a cross to the back of
the Wizards goal to Hermosillo, whose header hit the near post and
ricocheted in front to a hustling Jones following up the play.
Jones easily placed the ball into an open net for his ninth goal of
the season.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he had a feeling-out type of first half and felt the
game start coming to him in the second 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a little frustrating in the first half, but things
started opening up a bit in the second half,'' Jones said. ``I got
that first goal and everything kind of floated after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while for the team to get used to me and remembering
how I play. They realized they can play through me and that I want
the ball in certain situations.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy defender Paul Caligiuri, who shadowed Kansas City's Preki
the entire game, said it was good to see Jones running up and down
the flanks again.
</P>
<P>
   ``His speed and ability to score goals is a great attribute,''
Caligiuri said. ``He's dangerous every time he gets the ball. When
we took the lead early in the first half, we were asking him to
push back more. In the second half we asked him to go forward and
you could see he's much more dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy coach Octavio Zambrano was pleased with the Galaxy's
performance overall but wouldn't be specific as to why Welton
didn't start. The Brazilian striker came on in the 69th minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are issues within the team (as to why Welton didn't
start) and that should remain with us,'' Zambrano said.
</P>
<P>
   Was it disciplinary?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say,'' he said. ``But I was happy that he came
in and he provided a spark for us. He's definitely a player that we
can't keep on the bench for long.''
</P>
<P>
   Ezra Hendrickson, who missed last Saturday's game against San
Jose because of a strained ligament in his right foot, showed no
signs of pain in the early going, setting up his seventh assist of
the season to give L.A. a 1-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The outside attacking defender received a perfect pass from
Mauricio Cienfuegos as he was cutting from the right side into the
penalty area. Hendrickson shouldered off a defender and one-touched
a pass to a streaking Clint Mathis 5 yards in front of the Wizards
goal. Mathis easily tapped his shot past Kansas City goalkeeper
Mike Ammann for an early Galaxy lead in the eighth minute.

COLLINS SAYS ANGELS ARE LOAFING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels set a franchise record with 22 victories in
June, but after losing their first four in July _ including
Saturday night's 8-3 loss to the Oakland A's before a sellout crowd
of 43,571 at Edison Field _ manager Terry Collins was hot.
</P>
<P>
   Collins ripped his team after the game, implying it hasn't
maintained the tenacity that propelled it into the AL West lead.
</P>
<P>
   The players reaction? Give us a break.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know you're going to have bad days,'' Collins said. ``But
you've still got to play with intensity, play hard, run balls out.
You play the game one way, I don't care if it's June 1, July 1 or
Aug. 1, you play hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things don't just happen. You go out and create things, and we
haven't done that. When you come back in games, you step it up. But
guess what? A lot of times you step it up before the seventh
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a natural thing to eventually have a letdown when you
play as hard as we play. When you have a letdown, you have games
like we did tonight. But if you're fatigued, all you have to do is
walk in here and say `I'm tired.' That's why we've got guys on the
bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The players candidly exercised their right to disagree with
their manager.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's TC's observation, not my observation,'' shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``I thought we played hard, they just beat us, they
played better than us. Give 'em some credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to look at the big picture. We've had a great first
half, there's no sense panicking now about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Oakland's swinging the bat great,'' designated hitter Tim
Salmon said. ``I don't look at it any deeper than that. We've just
got to pick ourselves up. It's been no different the last four days
than the whole month of June.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to take the losing with the winning. You've got to
be a man about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't buy that intensity level stuff,'' first baseman Cecil
Fielder said. ``We're not going out there trying to lose, we're
trying to win. Sometimes it doesn't work out. What are you going to
do, cry about it?''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels didn't get the type of performance they've grown used
to from starting pitcher Jarrod Washburn. Washburn (4-1) went into
the game unbeaten, and the Angels were 6-0 in games he's started.
</P>
<P>
   But he lasted only five innings because of tightness in his left
(pitching) forearm.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the second inning he said his forearm was stiff,'' Collins
said. ``We thought it would loosen up, but in the fifth, his
velocity was down 5 mph, so we got him out of there. It's nothing
serious, we just didn't want to take a chance with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Washburn said the problem is not new to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``One or two times a year it pops up,'' he said. ``You go out to
warm up for the game and it doesn't get loose. But there was no
pain.''
</P>
<P>
   The only pain the Angels seemed to feel was Collins' pain
watching the Angels match their longest losing streak of the
season. They lost four in a row May 3-6 and May 23-27.
</P>
<P>
   The A's rallied from a 2-1 deficit to take a 3-2 lead in the
fifth off Washburn. Knuckleballer Steve Sparks entered the game in
the sixth, and gave up a 447-foot home run to Jason Giambi for a
4-2 Oakland lead.
</P>
<P>
   That was enough for A's starter Mike Oquist (5-5), who gave up
two runs and five hits in 62/3 innings to get the win.
</P>
<P>
   The A's added four runs in the ninth to put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   ``No team is going to win 162 games, I haven't seen that yet,''
Fielder said. ``You can't look at Oakland as a team that can't beat
us. They can beat us.... This game's a trip _ you win some, you
lose some.''

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It was only about 10 years ago that sports agent
Raymond Anderson received the biggest shock of his career.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson, president of AR Sports, Inc., was trying to land a
star UCLA football player.
</P>
<P>
   An African-American graduate of Stanford and Harvard Law School
who played both football and baseball for the Cardinal, Anderson
didn't get the client. The player, who was black, didn't believe
Anderson would have the same connections as a white agent, even
though Anderson had been in the business since 1979.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was going with another agent and not us for the simple fact
he believed (pro sports) is a good-ol'-boy industry,'' said
Anderson, a member of the board of directors for the Sports Lawyers
Association and the Black Sports Agents Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, he thought a (white) agent would just naturally
be able to get a contract for him because the establishment was
much more comfortable with dealing with those type of folks than
African-Americans. That was the reason and only reason he was not
coming with us. He sincerely believed all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the UCLA player was not satisfied with his agent and
decided to make a change. Again, he opted for a white agent.
</P>
<P>
   As for Anderson, his clientele includes Tampa Bay Buccaneers
coach Tony Dungy, Minnesota Vikings coach Denny Green, Stanford
coach Tyrone Willingham, Atlanta Falcons offensive tackle Bob
Whitfield and Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Ray Lewis, all
African-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Today, African-American agents are still fighting to gain a
share of the market. According to figures released by the
respective leagues, African-Americans make up 70 percent of all NBA
players, 67 percent of the NFL and 17 percent of professional
baseball players. Approximately 11 percent are represented by
African-American agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came out, it was just kind of the norm to have a white
agent,'' said D'Marco Farr, whose brother/agent Andre is chairman
of the Black Sports Agents Association. &QL; 
Matter of perception
</P>
<P>
   Black sports agents only recently have impacted the industry.
For years, many African-American athletes believed it was a risk to
have someone of their race handling their financial affairs.
</P>
<P>
   American University sports researcher Charles Farrell believes
it's due to the ``colder ice'' theory. Farrell's theory _ based on
an old fable _ is blacks would rather buy ice from a white man
instead of a black man because they believe the white man's ice is
colder.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the black community, we've been brainwashed to believe
that,'' said Farrell, who also runs the Sports Perspective
International Institute that helps promote sports opportunities for
blacks. ``(Blacks) go to a white doctor or a white attorney because
we think they are better. It is a terrible stereotype to overcome
and many black athletes have grown up with this stereotype.''
</P>
<P>
   Oakland Raiders and ex-Michigan defensive back Charles Woodson
debunks the theory. Instead, the fourth overall pick in the first
round of the 1998 NFL Draft has decided to go with Charles and
Kevin Poston, two African-American agents.
</P>
<P>
   Woodson considered David Falk, the well-known agent who
represents Michael Jordan and many other NBA stars. But he opted
for the Postons, who represent NBA All-Star Penny Hardaway and the
St. Louis Rams' Orlando Pace _ the first overall pick in the 1997
NFL draft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the only way to go for me,'' said Woodson, 21. ``I
don't know of anybody that can represent me better than those two
right there. It wasn't really a black or white issue. I just felt
they deserved a chance more so than a white agent.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late '70s, Anderson said he was one of about eight black
sports agents. In its last calculations, the BSAA said there are
1,096 African-American agents but less than 40 percent are
certified through the professional leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Agent Jim Steiner, who is white, said the colder ice theory is
no longer prevalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that has gone by the wayside now because a number of black
agents are doing a good job for their clients,'' said Steiner, who
has black clients Jerry Rice and 1998 NFL first-rounder Marcus Nash
of Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Celtics guard Kenny Anderson, who is black, was coveted
by agents before he was selected as the second player overall in
the 1992 NBA draft out of Georgia Tech. Although the New Jersey
Nets' all-time assist leader said he interviewed several agents
when he decided to leave school after his sophomore year, he didn't
consider any black agents.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't because he didn't feel comfortable with a black
agent, he said, he just wasn't approached by any.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson said the coaches and peers of many
African-Americans are trying to push them toward black agents. But
if he was coming out of college, he says his decision on an agent
would not be based on race. Rather, he would choose a
representative based on his experience and success rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prejudiced and I'm not one who will go the opposite
way,'' said Kenny Anderson, who started with a white agent before
switching to Falk. ``I'm about who is going to handle my business
right. When I was coming out, there weren't that many black
agents... I didn't have a choice. I went with someone that was
going to take care of my business and give me a decent contract.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you've been around (like Falk), you get a lot of deals
and make it happen. The players who want a good deal are going with
someone (with a good reputation).'' &QL; 
Familiarity factor
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is black athletes feel comfortable with black
agents because of their shared experience. That is something many
black agents say gives them an edge over their white counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I would do better and feel more comfortable with
someone of my own race,'' said Cincinnati Bengals first-round pick
Takeo Spikes, who has African-American agent James Sims. ``They
have been through what I've been through during the years. It
builds a special relationship between you and the agent. I didn't
really consider a white agent. Choosing a black agent is something
I felt comfortable with.''
</P>
<P>
   Woodson said, ``A black agent just knows how it is to be a black
man. No white agent can do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Anderson disagrees. He said athletes should only be
concerned with how their agent handles their contracts and business
dealings.
</P>
<P>
   ``When my agent gets my deal, I say, `Thanks a lot, here's your
four or five percent,''' Anderson said. ``The color issue is
overrated. I go with the best guy for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Steiner believes many black agents use race to gain an advantage
with black athletes. Still, he said, what matters is doing the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The color of your skin doesn't negotiate a better deal for
that player,'' Steiner said. ``It is the person's experience,
knowledge or wherewithall to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In his second year as chairman of the BSAA, Farr looks to the
future. He sees a day when agents will be judged solely on
expertise and competence, a day when black agents are more visible
in the industry. And at that time, being a white or black sports
agent won't matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically, I want to level the playing field,'' Farr said.
``If we do that, the entire industry will change.''

BLACK AGENTS RARE FOR WHITE ATHLETES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MARC J. SPEARS  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Although the number of black athletes represented
by black agents is low, the number of white athletes represented by
black agents is just as astonishing. Many members of the BSAA's
Board of Directors said less than one percent of white pro athletes
are represented by black agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``White athletes have never given black agents a chance. Never
done that... never will,'' said black agent Kevin Poston.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Steiner, a white sports agent, agrees with Poston but feels
the situation is changing.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will change, but it will take much longer,'' Steiner said.
``That is the way of the world and it is way it is. I can't think
of any other reason other than that is the evolution of it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Zandofsky, however, is an exception to the rule.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-year NFL offensive lineman _ who is white _ has spent his
entire career with a black agent, Raymond Anderson. ``He works as
hard on my $500,000 contract as he does for a $5 million contract
for another player,'' Zandofsky said.
</P>
<P>
   Zandofsky said when he was with the Atlanta Falcons, three black
teammates were shocked to know he was represented by the same agent
as they were.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't matter what race (Raymond) was to me or anyone
else,'' Zandofsky said. ``You should go with the guy that is going
to do the best job for you whether he is white or black. You would
think that people would think in terms of his professionalism and
how well-prepared they are.''
</P>
<P>
   While signing white players hasn't been easy, some
African-American agents say that part of the blame lies with
themselves. The overwhelming majority of black agents stick with
just the NFL and NBA _ both predominantly black leagues _ because
the two leagues give them the safest route of success.
</P>
<P>
   Anderson said black agents must use the same confidence in
signing white athletes as they use to sign black athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We as black agents also have to take some responsibility to
target non-African-Americans as guys we want to do business with,
too,'' he said. ``We go after a handful, but it always has to be a
profile that fits us.''
</P>
<P>
   BSAA chairman Andre Farr, an ex-UCLA football player, said, ``We
can't survive representing African-Americans alone. With the new
millennium coming up, we have more opportunities. How can we call
ourselves successful agents if we don't go into soccer, baseball or
golf? We have to go into uncharted waters.''

 &HT;    Caution light for school bus ads
 &HT;    By A. Phillips Brooks
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Jackie Dyer, superintendent of a poor school
district in far West Texas, thought he hit upon a perfect idea for
raising extra money to finance safety equipment for school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer, who heads the Fabens Independent School District, did not
go to taxpayers for help. He went to advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Fabens' 12 yellow school buses now bear McDonald's, Coca Cola,
American Airlines and other ads. And thanks to the ad revenue, the
buses carry two-way radios and flashing red stop signs that unfold
into traffic when children board or exit.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way for us to earn some extra dollars,'' Dyer said
of the advertising, which generates $18,000 annually for his
district _ the 13th poorest of the state's more than 1,000
districts.
</P>
<P>
   But his new source of money may be dried up by actions playing
out in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   The Texas Department of Public Safety, responding to a law
passed in 1997, is devising rules to regulate advertising on school
buses. If passed in their current form, the regulations would
severely limit the space and placement of advertising on buses _ in
the name of safety.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer's case points up a dilemma faced by school districts across
the state and nation. Strapped for cash, some increasingly are
turning to advertising for new money to finance school activities.
But bright, colorful advertising emblazoned across school buses may
go too far, posing safety risks for students, some say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids are more important than income,'' said Sen. Teel Bivins,
R-Amarillo, chairman of the Senate Education Committee. ``We
parents are entrusting our children's lives to these vehicles, and
I think we should be very cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   New state rules regulating advertising on school buses would
have far-reaching effects. Aside from the Fabens school district,
Socorro in West Texas and the Lake Worth district near Fort Worth
also are carrying ads. And the San Marcos district _ as well as
others _ may not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which
regulates school bus transportation, say they are proceeding with
caution in drafting the rules.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposed rules, advertising would be limited to only
two places on a school bus _ the left rear quarter panel and above
the windows on either side of the bus.
</P>
<P>
   The goal is to balance the needs of school districts, who are
looking for additional money to finance school activities, against
the safety of children who ride the school buses. DPS officials
worry that ads would distract drivers and detract from the effect
of the school buses' bright yellow color.
</P>
<P>
   ``Placing advertising on the sides of the school bus within a
student's reach could entice a student to enter or linger in the
`danger zone' with the intention of touching the advertisement,''
DPS Director Dudley Thomas said in a March 1998 letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The school bus is one of the most widely recognized vehicles
on the road due to its shape, yellow color and school bus
markings.''
</P>
<P>
   Eye-catching ads on the exterior of a bus might distract drivers
or interfere with their ability to easily recognize a school bus.
That, in turn, could lead to more accidents involving school buses.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer is not buying that explanation. His district buses have
rolled along the streets of Fabens for two years without incident
or accident because of the ads, he said. And he points to school
districts in six other states, whose buses are bearing ads, he
says, apparently without an increase in accidents.
</P>
<P>
   Colorado districts in 1994 were the first to offer school buses
for advertising. Since 1997, five additional states have adopted
rules. Because programs are new, there is not enough data to know
if ads are causing more accidents, according to the DPS. In
Colorado Springs, where ad contracts for school buses and hallways
total $8 million annually, safety has not been a primary issue.
</P>
<P>
   Texas DPS officials say that before rules are approved and put
on the books, the public will have a chance to comment on them.
</P>
<P>
   Dyer said DPS has not done its homework thoroughly. He calls it
a case of big government picking on little government.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had come down here and stood on the street corner and
witnessed two or three accidents, then I could understand it,'' he
said. ``I might as well not advertise if they make me take them
(ads) off from all but the back panel (of the bus).''
</P>
<P>
   Dyer has solicited the help of Gov. George W. Bush and U.S. Sen.
Phil Gramm to stop the rules, or at least loosen them to allow more
advertising in more places on a school bus.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are going to force these rules on us,'' he said. ``Yes,
we are poor. But it's not right for them to push us around.''
</P>
<P>
   The district, with 2,760 students, has a dozen buses that
display ads, which sell for $250 each. Aside from McDonald's, Coca
Cola and American Airlines, the buses carry ads from 14 other
companies.
</P>
<P>
   If Fabens in rural West Texas can raise $18,000 a year through
such a program, San Marcos _ with about 60 school buses _ could
pull in about $100,000, figures Hector Montenegro, superintendent
of the San Marcos Consolidated School District south of Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most taxpayers would probably support our interest to
look at other options to finance district-related activities,''
Montenegro said. ``We are looking into that as an option.''
</P>
<P>
   Montenegro said school districts have entered an era of greater
collaboration between corporations and schools. The school bus
advertising program seems ``a natural segue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But others aren't so sure. They said that increasingly,
corporate America is aggressively reaching into the nation's
schools to the captive audience of schoolchildren. And schools,
strapped for cash, are willing partners.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some concerns about the growing commercialism in
schools and the impact on our kids,'' said Melissa Anderson, a
spokeswoman for the National Education Association. ``Kids are in
school to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the trend hardly is expected to let up because
schools are constantly looking for new sources of money to
supplement tax dollars, she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the Lake Worth district, a recorded message greets callers:
``Thank you for calling the Lake Worth Independent School District,
educational partners with Lake Worth National Bank and American
Airlines.''
</P>
<P>
   Bivins said the decision of whether to offer school buses,
hallways or school score boards to advertisers is a local decision.
But he added, regulating ads on school buses is a safety issue that
belongs to the state.
</P>
<P>
   Bivins offered one creative solution to the dilemma of school
bus advertising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe all the advertising could be yellow,'' he said.

   &UR; ANYTHING YOUR LITTLE HEART DESIRES: AN AMERICAN FAMILY STORY &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Patricia Bosworth. Touchstone/Simon &AMP; Schuster, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The daughter of Bartley C. Crum, the famous corporate lawyer of
the 1940s and '50s and champion of leftist causes, tracks the
dazzling arc of her father's life, including his undoing by his
personal and political furies. Last year our reviewer, Richard
Lingeman, called this a ``multilayered act of discovery and
reconciliation ... in which redemption comes from the truth of the
telling.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; UNDERWORLD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Don DeLillo. Scribner, $16.
</P>
<P>
   This sprawling wake for the Cold War explores how people
rearranged their lives around the moral void of Mutual Assured
Destruction, with its attending terror and absurdity. Selected by
the editors of the Book Review as one of the best books of 1997,
the novel spans half a century, from its opening in 1951 at one of
baseball's legendary games to its epilogue in central Asia. The
characters -- both fictional and cultural heroes like Frank Sinatra
and Lenny Bruce -- are psychological fallout victims. ``
`Underworld' surges with magisterial confidence,'' Martin Amis said
here last year. ``It isn't every day, or even every decade, that
one sees the ascension of a great writer.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RESURRECTION: THE STRUGGLE FOR A NEW RUSSIA &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By David Remnick. Vintage, $15.
</P>
<P>
   The author argues that the Russian people have had their fill of
Boris Yeltsin and the oligarchs who gained power after his
re-election in 1996. ``As a gifted journalist, with an eye for the
broad themes as well as the telling details of a story, he provides
us with an amplitude of particulars'' about the miseries that have
occurred during Yeltsin's reign of deception and criminality,
Abraham Brumberg wrote here last year. The thesis of  &UR; PETERSBURG,
CRUCIBLE OF CULTURAL REVOLUTION &LR; , by Katerina Clark (Harvard
University, $18.95), is that the city's idealistic artists and
intellectuals during the tumultuous years between 1913 and 1931
created an atmosphere that made the Great Terror of the late 1930s
possible. This revisionist account is ``a major contribution to the
cultural history of this seminal period,'' Harlow Robinson said in
the Book Review in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE BLESSING &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Nancy Mitford. Carroll &AMP; Graf, $10.95.
</P>
<P>
   This spirited riff on French-British relations on the highest
social plane pits a beautiful English wife and her charming French
nobleman husband against a diabolical villain: their young son. The
result is a ``cunningly constructed, artfully written ... farce of
the most civilized kind,'' Elizabeth Janeway wrote here in 1951.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; IMAGINING ROBERT. MY BROTHER, MADNESS, AND SURVIVAL: A MEMOIR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Jay Neugeboren. Owl/Holt, $14.95.
</P>
<P>
   A novelist describes his younger brother's 30-year battle with
mental illness, and his own struggle to navigate the nightmarish
system of mistreatment and inattentive care hat dooms many victims
of schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorder. This is a
``powerful story,'' Frederick Busch said in these pages in 1997. In
 &UR; OUT OF THE SHADOWS: CONFRONTING AMERICA'S MENTAL ILLNESS CRISIS &LR; ,
by E. Fuller Torrey (Wiley, $16.95), a psychiatrist reports that
millions of Americans are suffering from severe mental illness
without treatment. ``The crisis he delineates should stir any
halfway sensitive human being to anger,'' Daniel J. Kevles wrote
here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE UNDERGROUND MAN &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Mick Jackson. Penguin, $12.95.
</P>
<P>
   This first novel focuses on one of Victorian England's most
famous eccentrics, the real-life fifth Duke of Portland, who built
an elaborate network of tunnels beneath his lands to allow him
hidden access to all parts of his realm. ``Jackson has produced a
marvelous study of human foibles,'' Erik Burns said here in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BEAR AND HIS DAUGHtER: STORIES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Robert Stone. Mariner/Houghton Mifflin, $12.
</P>
<P>
   The novelist's first collection of short fiction is populated by
men who feel most alive when they are angry. In evoking a kind of
grinding male arrest, ``Stone turns the scraps and figments of
style that we call characters into real people,'' James Wood wrote
here last year.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; NEVER EAT YOUR HEART OUT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   By Judith Moore. North Point, $13.
</P>
<P>
   A California writer and editor expresses her life story through
the food she has prepared, peppering her lively account with
bite-sized essays on everything from the history of the cranberry
to the sex life of turkeys. Last year our reviewer, Susan Cheever,
called this a ``tart, satisfying'' memoir.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE TEACHINGS OF DON B.: SATIRES, PARODIES, FABLES, ILLUSTRATED
STORIES, AND PLAYS OF DONALD BARTHELME &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Edited by Kim Herzinger. Vintage International, $15.
</P>
<P>
   Whether a parody of Bret Easton Ellis or a shaggy dog story
about a 4,000-pound Gouda cheese, the 63 pieces collected here
bristle with the author's delight in surprising the reader with his
genre-jumping acrobatics. The result is ``a small education in
laughter, melancholy, and the English language,'' James Marcus
wrote here in 1992.  &UR; A DOG'S HEAD &LR; , by Jean Dutourd, translated by
Robin Chancellor (University of Chicago, $12), is a slender
Barthelmesque fantasy about a middle-class Frenchman born with the
tete of a spaniel. This satirical novel is ``sad-eyed, witty and
often very funny,'' C.J. Rolo wrote here in 1953.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ Jumbojets from around the globe on Monday
inaugurated the new $9.1 billion Hong Kong International Airport,
one of the most advanced and architecturally dramatic airports in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Though air travel has been diminished by the Asian financial
crisis, more than 30 million passengers a year are expected to pass
through the soaring white glass-and-steel terminal that is
described as the world's largest public building.
</P>
<P>
   Following nine years of planning, the most crucial hours in
opening the airport were the final 13 leading up to the first
commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 5:30 p.m. Sunday evening, thousands of workers
undertook a Promethean transfer of airport loading ramps, fueling
trucks and other equipment to the new airport. The Chinese news
agency Xinhua called the move from Hong Kong's old Kai Tak airport
the biggest peacetime transfer of material ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong roads were closed, hundreds of police called out to
keep the order and curious locals shooed away from the 18-mile road
corridor separating the two air fields.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 vehicles in 16 convoys were scripted to haul the
apparatus necessary to make Hong Kong International function, from
tractors and pallet pushers to 70,000 sets of silverware for the
catering service.
</P>
<P>
   Heavier equipment was slotted to sail on 14 barges westward
through Victoria Harbor to the new facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every airport has its problems,'' said the airport's corporate
development director Clinton Leeks in an interview. ``I don't know
what ours will be. We'll find out, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the airport's attractions is the Airport Express, a rail
link that connects passengers at speeds of up to 81 MPH with two
downtown check-in terminals in Hong Kong center and Kowloon. The
train takes just 23 minutes to reach the airport, which is built on
the island of Chek Lap Kok in the South China Sea 18 miles west of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction -- if it works -- is one of the world's
largest baggage handling conveyer systems. It promises to deliver
arriving luggage to the baggage carousels in 15 minutes, the
average length of time it will take passengers to have their
passports stamped and reach the baggage area.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong airport overseers originally planned to use a
computerized baggage routing system. But after dispatching an
inspection team to the new Denver airport, they decided to defer
plans for a Denver-like automatic routing system until it can be
proven at other airports.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new Hong Kong airport recruited an army of baggage
handlers big enough to unload and route 20,000 bags an hour along
nine miles of conveyer belts.
</P>
<P>
   While landing, passengers will look down on a single gigantic
Y-shaped terminal three-quarters of a mile long that resembles the
profile of an airplane in flight. Once inside the terminal, they
will be under a giant lightweight vaulted roof big enough to
contain 85 American football fields.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal's top level is for check-in and passport control,
the middle level is for duty-free shops and departure gates, and
the bottom level is for arrivals and baggage carousels.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know where to go, you simply follow the roof,'' the British
architect Sir Norman Foster has said. ``You follow the lines of the
vaulted arch structure, and although you are moving through a
variety of spaces, you always know where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Foster has told local journalists that his design was
inspired by an old aerial photograph of Atlanta's wedge-shaped
airport terminal in the 1930s. He said he was trying to capture the
``simplicity'' of the old Atlanta airport and ``achieve that
simplicity in an international airport.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Hong Kong International, which is designed mainly for
jumbojets, has 38 terminal-side ``air bridges'' that can handle
Boeing 747s or European Airbuses. It is building 10 positions for
the 600-passenger Airbus super-jumbojets that are now under
development in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong is under Chinese sovereignty, passengers will
find that Chinese censorship rules do not apply here. One of the
books prominently displayed in an airport bookshop is ``The Private
Life of Chairman Mao'' by the late communist leader Mao Tse-tung's
private physician Li Zhisui, a book banned in mainland China
because of its graphic descriptions of Mao's sexual adventures.
</P>
<P>
   On its opening day, the new Hong Kong airport expects about half
the traffic volume of the world's three busiest airports, Chicago
O'Hare (69 million passengers in 1966), Atlanta's Hartsfield (63
million in 1966) and Dallas/Fort Worth (58 million in 1966).
</P>
<P>
   But within a decade, Hong Kong airport authorities plan to open
second huge terminal, this one X-shaped, that they say will
increase the passenger capacity to 89 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong will compete with new-generation airports in Tokyo,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul to become the dominant Asian hub
in 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday was the first day of commercial flights, the
airport opened to several VIP flights last Thursday - one by
President Jiang Zemin and another by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong International Airport is part of a $20 billion air,
road and rail transportation plan that Hong Kong's British colonial
rulers announced in 1989. Beijing raised angry objections because
of the large cost, but after negotiations China and Britain reached
agreement in 1994, three years before the British handed over Hong
Kong to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hong Kong poured out in the last few days to say
good-bye to the old airport, whose downtown Kowloon location made
it a nuisance to neighboring residents and a great convenience to
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday and Sunday thousands perched on the bridges and
waterfront rocks to photograph the last thunderous jet arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Through the final day aircraft continued gliding down between
mountains and skyscrapers in the sharp right turn that for years
has paralyzed unwitting passengers wondering why their pilot was
hurtling them into the high-rise core of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Chek Lap Kok will be neither so frightening nor so
exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will still see sights,'' insisted Lily Mg, a 20-year-old
college student working with the Airport Authority this summer,
``but it won't be in such close proximity that you think you'll
land in someone's flat.''

   HONG KONG _ One of the biggest and, at $9 billion, most

   NAACP _ ATLANTA _ The National Association for the Advancement
of Colored People will hold its national convention in Atlanta
Friday, July 10 to Tuesday, July 14. The group, now chaired by
former Georgia Sen. Julian Bond, has not met here since 1962. We
interview him about the organization's future. Story also will
highlight the major issues facing the NAACP, and will include a
summary of invited guests. Ted Turner, Vice President Gore and Gen.

   NAACP-FARMERS _ The plight of the nation's black farmers and
black land loss will be featured at the NAACP convention. (Scott,
Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   GA-PRIVATEPRISONS _ The Georgia Department of Corrections has no
reservations or apprehensions as it takes the final steps into an
area it has never been _ privately-run prisons for adults. There
have been problems _ some of them dangerous _ for states that have
hired corporate America to incarcerate criminals. That doesn't
bother the folks at the Georgia Department of Corrections because
they are certain they have all the bases covered. (Cook, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution)

<P>
   EDS: The following enterprise stories moved earlier in the week
and are still good for Sunday use.
</P>
<P>
   INTERNATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   ASIA-TRAVEL _ WASHINGTON _ Once an out-of-reach destination for
frugal travelers, east Asia is now more accessible than ever.
Tumbling currencies due to Asia's economic woes have resulted in
deep discounts on airfares, hotel rooms and package tours. With
intra-Asian travel at a near halt, airlines and tour operators are
looking to fill up empty seats and hotel rooms with Western
travelers. Once in Asia, Americans will find their dollar stretch
with drastically-reduced merchandise. (Abulhassan, Cox News
Service.) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   With ASIA-TRAVEL-BOX _ WASHINGTON _ Sample comparison data on
airfares, hotel rates and travel package prices for several
destinations in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-TURTLES _ XCACEL, Mexico _ Biologists camp on the beach
at Mexico's beautiful Quintana Roo coastline _ called Xcacel and
considered one of most important turtle nesting grounds in the
Caribbean _ to protect endangered turtles and their eggs from
poachers. But soon, they fear, their work will be obliterated. The
state government has quietly sold much of Xcacel to resort hotel
developers, despite a covenant that was signed to protect it and
years of effort to have it declared a federal reserve. Soon, the
turtles could be greeted by as many as 1,500 hotel rooms jammed
onto the small beach, producing glaring lights that would drive the
turtles away. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). MOVED. WITH PHOTOS.
</P>
<P>
   BAHRAIN-DEMOCRACY _ MANAMA, Bahrain _ Bahrain has everything
American _ Penneys, Dairy Queen and a huge American naval base.
But, it doesn't have democracy. Human rights groups report that the
government regularly uses torture and imprisonment without trial.
The country's leading religious figure is a political prisoner. We
talk to his wife and son. It's as hard to find people who will talk
to reporters in Bahrain as it is in Baghdad. (Kaplow, Cox News
Service). MOVED. WITH PHOTOS.

   With BAHRAIN-GLANCEBOX _The vital statistics on Bahrain.

   CONGRESS-RATINGS _ WASHINGTON _ It's report card time again _
not for students, but for members of Congress. The cards are issued
by nearly 100 special interest groups from across the political
spectrum. And with congressional elections less than four months
away, lawmakers are paying close attention to their grades and what
they mean to voters. (Marselas, Cox News Service 950). MOVED.

   RURAL-HOSPITALS _ MONTICELLO, Va. _ Amid rapid changes in health
care, rural hospitals are struggling to retain their key role in
their communities. (Carr, Cox News Service 1500). MOVED. WITH

payments for their services, the nation's biggest health
maintenance organizations are quitting managed care programs that
states and the federal government promote as a means to provide
good care while holding down the cost. The retreat is most
pronounced in Medicaid programs for the poor. Starting a little
more than a year ago and accelerating lately, managed care
organizations like Aetna U.S. Healthcare, PacifiCare, Oxford Health

Associations, have been shutting down services in at least 14

   CONGRESS-POLITICS (Washington) _ The battle for the House this

on such factors as a decision by Representative Wes Watkins not to

   LONDON-ART-MARKET (London) _ The high price recently paid for a
Monet became something of a symbol here as the most important weeks
of the summer art season unfold. Its importance was not that it was
the third-highest price ever paid for a work of art in London, or
that the work was extremely rare, since many of the artist's works
are in museums. It was a sign of strength for the London art
market, which has been increasingly unstable the last several
years. By Carol Vogel.

   NJ-ARTS-CENTER (Newark) _ Pronouncing their first season a

   KINKO-PEOPLE (Undated) _ At last count, there are nearly 40
million Americans working out of their homes with the help of
electronic conveniences such as cell phones, fax machines and
handheld organizers. And on any given day, tens of thousands of
them stop by a Kinko's Copy store. For many home-based workers, the
attraction is often less about what equipment Kinko's provides than
what their own home offices don't: other people. As millions more
people join the work-at-home trend each year, Kinko's appears to be
doing what many people envisioned cybercafes would do -- that is,

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Nanci Donnellan is interested in jazz, opera and
popular culture, but you would never know it from her radio
persona: the self-described Fabulous Sports Babe, the only female
host of a nationally syndicated sports talk show.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime broadcaster and celebrity in her own right, the Babe,
as she demands to be called, is not cowed by the bluster of George
Steinbrenner, owner of the New York Yankees, who made an appearance
on her show the night after a brawl between his team and the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   She can also build rapport with athletes like the slugger Ken
Griffey Jr., known for his reticence off the field. She is equally
well known for her opinionated, gravelly over-the-air bellow and
lightning-quick repartee. Sports fans who bore the Babe are blown
off the show with the sound of an explosion.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know not to diddle around,'' Ms. Donnellan said. ``I do
not suffer fools lightly.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the risk of such ignominy, about 250,000 sports fans
each month call the Babe's 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily call-in show,
transmitted live from New York to 187 stations. It is one of the
few radio programs to generate nearly $1 million in annual revenue.
As a measure of its success, nearly two-thirds of the 300 stations
that broadcast news, sports and talk exclusively are Babe
affiliates.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Donnellan's show is not heard in the nation's
largest market. In New York, the first all-sports station, WFAN,
holds sway over sports enthusiasts with its own well-known local
hosts. Neither is she on in Los Angeles or San Francisco, where the
time difference means her show starts during morning drive time,
often the most lucrative part of the day and generally ceded to a
local host.
</P>
<P>
   ``We keep trying,'' said T.J. Lambert, a vice president in
Dallas for ABC Radio, owned by Walt Disney Co. ABC Radio took over
the distribution of the Babe's show in April 1997 after Ms.
Donnellan alienated the management of ESPN, the Disney cable
network that had given her a national platform.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN, then an ABC division and the undisputed leader in sports
TV, hired the Sports Babe in 1992 as the centerpiece of its
expansion into radio. The move into the big leagues enhanced Ms.
Donnellan's credibility, but her on-air persona, caroming between
irreverent and motherly to cranky and flirty, stood out.
</P>
<P>
   ``She did not blend into the woodwork; it rubbed them the wrong
way,'' said Mark Mason, program director for WINS-AM in New York
and a former general manager of ESPN radio, who helped hire Ms.
Donnellan. ``At ESPN, the call letters are the star, and anyone who
rises above a certain level of notoriety is problematic.'' Similar
complaints, he said, have contributed to the departure of other
stand-out ESPN hosts like Keith Olbermann.
</P>
<P>
   ``The final coup de grace,'' Mason said, was ``The Babe in
Boyland,'' an obscenity-filled memoir, published in 1996 by
HarperCollins, in which Ms. Donnellan takes shots at nearly
everyone in sports, including her bosses and the leagues her bosses
court for broadcast rights. ``They wanted to turn me into the Cokie
Roberts of sports broadcasting, a place where the hardest sports
news is explained in the most mind-numbing manner possible,'' she
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the contretemps has left Ms. Donnellan unscathed, as the
sports business flourishes on radio as well as television. Radio is
now served by two 24-hour sports networks and three daily
syndicated shows, including the Sports Babe's. The other hosts are
Tony Kornheiser on ESPN and Jim Rome on Premiere Radio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody cares about X's and O's,'' said Rick Scott, a sports
radio programming consultant. ``It's not about information; it's
about opinion and a unique perspective. The Babe's got a real grasp
on the entertainment aspect.''
</P>
<P>
   It was Scott who recruited Ms. Donnellan to KVN in Seattle,
where she raised the station's audience share from 0.04 percent to
6 percent. Her barbed tongue was honed as sports director and
afternoon host in Tampa, Fla. And it was there, bedridden from a
golf injury, that she blurted out an invitation to her audience to
spend the afternoon in bed with a ``fabulous sports babe.'' The
name stuck.
</P>
<P>
   In both intellect and proportion, Ms. Donnellan is the
antithesis of an empty-headed anorexic bimbo. She is a news addict
who watches dozens of televised sports events and takes to the
stands whenever affiliates seek her for a personal appearance.
October is frantic, with baseball and football seasons overlapping.
</P>
<P>
   Her goal is to skunk her competitors by being the first with
news. She also grills guest athletes with questions that interest
ordinary fans. ``It's not brain surgery,'' she conceded. ``We talk
a lot of issues, like racism, having seven children with six women,
choking the coach.''
</P>
<P>
   Philosophically, her game plan is to stoke the show's energy
with the unexpected friction from undercutting stereotypes. That
might mean taking a call from a fan with a hard-to-understand
accent or inviting a female sportswriter as a show guest. ``I don't
miss an opportunity for that,'' she said.

 By PAMELA LICALZI O'CONNELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some dare call it electronic commerce.
</P>
<P>
   A major consumer products company logged 264,000 telephone calls
to its customer service center in a recent month and handled
225,000 in what it considered satisfactory fashion _ a ``close''
rate of 85 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And during the same period, the center's service representative
received about 20,000 customer e-mail messages via the Internet.
Just 2,000 _ a measly 10 percent _ received attentive replies, and
some not for several weeks. (This data was shared on the condition
that the company not be identified.)
</P>
<P>
   Say hello to the Web as black hole.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce? One-to-one communication? The promise of these
buzzwords is belied by simple reality: Many companies, even those
with a seemingly sophisticated presence on the World Wide Web,
continue to treat customer e-mail as second-class communication.
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence and some limited market research confirm that
unless a company is a Web-based business to start with, like the
online bookseller Amazon.com, the organization is likely to lack
the tools and policies to handle the inflow of messages from its
Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``When companies go on the Web they tend to immediately get
overwhelmed by messages,'' said Donna Hoffman, an associate
professor at the Owen Graduate School of Management at Vanderbilt
University. ``But some still don't see handling this e-mail as one
of the most important customer service jobs. They haven't created
the proper policies or allocated the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Hoffman, the director of an influential research program that
studies the marketing implications of commercializing the Web,
finds it disturbing that her own frequent messages to commercial
sites almost never result in a response. Web users may lose trust
in the medium if their experience is similar, she said.
</P>
<P>
   According to a survey earlier this year by First Data Investor
Services Group, which supplies transaction services to mutual fund
companies, 82 percent of the mutual fund Web sites it tracks
advertise themselves as offering customer service via e-mail. Yet
when First Data tried to measure how long it took each site to
respond to e-mail, it found that about 30 percent of customer
messages never got any response.
</P>
<P>
   A reporter's unscientific spot check of the consumer-contact
e-mail addresses on the Web sites of two dozen well-known,
consumer-focused corporations did not fare much better: Only seven
of the sites responded in less than 24 hours, and five of the
companies never replied.
</P>
<P>
   One of the companies that did reply _ though it took a couple of
days _ was Nike, a company known for its marketing prowess. Even
though it is not a big online retailer, Nike sees sufficient value
in the more than 2,000 e-mail messages its site receives daily that
the company has devised extensive procedures for handling the
volume.
</P>
<P>
   ``At some forward-looking companies there is a realization that
you don't get to hear from customers often _ that you should
treasure it and find a way to deal with every e-mail,'' said Martha
Rogers, a partner at Peppers &AMP; Rogers Group in Stamford, Conn., a
consulting firm that focuses on ``one to one'' marketing.
</P>
<P>
   A recent report by Forrester Research was based on interviews
with 37 companies that Forrester selected as especially intent on
customer e-mail. Even among those companies, which average 500
incoming e-mails a day, dealing with the deluge can be confusing,
with responsibility split among departments. And most of the
companies sampled still manually route messages _ despite being
aware of automation tools that would speed the process.
</P>
<P>
   One such technology for automating customer e-mail is Echomail
from General Interactive Inc. in Cambridge, Mass. Echomail uses
natural-language and ``discourse analysis'' software to parse
messages in an attempt to classify them as, say, a complaint, a
sales lead or an investor inquiry. In some cases automated
responses may be sent, but most messages are typically routed to
customer-service agents.
</P>
<P>
   Echomail users include Nike, IBM, AT&AMP;T, Lycos, J.C. Penney and
Allstate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before someone puts in our system,'' said V.A. Shiva,
president and chief executive of General Interactive, ``we ask
them, `Do you value e-mail? Do you have policies and processes for
handling this inflow? Whose responsibility is this mail, marketing
or customer service or someone else? What happens to a message, for
instance, if it hasn't been read in five days?'''
</P>
<P>
   Shiva added that the slow adoption of systems to handle incoming
e-mail had ``a lot to do with technology but also with process and
elevation of consciousness _ even politics going on within
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Cost is probably a consideration, too, since such systems often
sell for $200,000 or more, according to Forrester.
</P>
<P>
   Shiva and other industry executives say that companies could
often create smarter customer-contact pages on their Web sites that
would greatly simplify e-mail management. An increasing number of
corporate sites ask _ or even require _ customers to complete a Web
form rather than send a free-form message. Even though some might
find the templates intimidating or off-putting, the consumers who
do proceed will be providing information that makes it easier for
the company to route and respond to the message.
</P>
<P>
   At the leading edge of managing customer e-mail are companies
that have trained their phone agents to handle e-mail, too,
treating it as simply another type of customer communication.
</P>
<P>
   ``A science has built up around handling 800-number calls after
all these years, but on the Web we are only recently seeing those
disciplines applied to handling customer e-mail,'' said Don
Morrison, executive vice president of Chordiant Software Inc. in
Palo Alto, Calif., a provider of customer-interaction technology.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Morrison points out that some messages, like those
involving order confirmations or complex instructions, are better
handled by e-mail than phone calls.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In fact, the discount stockbroker Charles Schwab is actively
trying to increase the percentage of customer queries handled by
e-mail rather than by phone, said Paul Raskin, director of Schwab's
electronic brokerage services unit. E-mail now accounts for
one-third of customer inquiries to the unit, up from one-tenth two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   As an example of a consumer-focused company that has
increasingly moved its business online, Schwab was quick to
recognize the value of customer messages.
</P>
<P>
   ``We actively promote e-mail as a customer-service channel,''
and electronic brokerage services receives up to 15,000 electronic
messages a week, Raskin said. About a quarter of the 300 service
agents that Raskin has working at any one time are devoted to
handling e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab, like most companies that deal with consumer e-mail, is
reluctant to send out automated responses.
</P>
<P>
   With automated responses the human aspect is lost, Hoffman said,
``and that goes against the whole idea of trying to create the
appearance of a personal relationship'' online.
</P>
<P>
   Even companies that do use boilerplate replies tend to reserve
them for only the most common questions _ as Nike, does, for
example, with queries about the location of the nearest retailer.
</P>
<P>
   One significant exception is Lycos, the Web-searching service.
With only two customer-service representatives, Lycos uses
Echomail's automated response capability to handle the majority of
its incoming messages _ most of which have to do with the listings
and navigation on its site.
</P>
<P>
   Lycos' experience with Echomail's parsing capabilities has been
positive, with 80 percent or more of the responses being
appropriate replies to the queries, said Adam Gross, a senior
customer-service representative for the company. Among the 20
percent of inapplicable responses was one to a reporter's spot
check. A question asking how to use Lycos to count the number of
sites on the Web that are linked to a specific home page was
answered with, ``We appreciate your desire to place a link to
Lycos,'' and instructions on how to link a home page to the
service.
</P>
<P>
   The timing of automated responses can be a sensitive issue.
Although the system is able to reply automatically within five
minutes, Gross has set it to respond at a more human pace _ within
12 hours. Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``If the response comes right away, the customer may discount it
as just a machine talking,'' Gross said. ``Even if the answer is
full and correct, they'll view it with disdain.''

ADVERTISING: 20 QUESTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By STUART ELLIOTT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's time again to ask 20 questions about advertising, marketing
and the media.
</P>
<P>
   _ Is the ``it'' referred to in advertising for the Gatorade
sports beverage sold by Quaker Oats Co. that asks ``Is it in you?''
the same ``it'' referred to by Seagram Co. in advertising for
Chivas Regal Scotch whisky that asserts ``You either have it or you
don't''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is it a sly inside joke when a woman in a commercial for the
Salon Selectives line of hair care products sold by Unilever
proclaims that her appearance gives her ``the power to conquer the
world ... or maybe just Cincinnati'' _ home of Procter &AMP; Gamble
Co., the principal rival of Unilever in such competitive fields as
hair care?
</P>
<P>
   _ How many history teachers complained to CBS about a
promotional commercial for a special program, ``People of the
Century,'' in which Dan Rather quoted Theodore Roosevelt's saying
as ``Walk softly and carry a big stick''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Wouldn't the corporate world be less insufferable if more
executives had a sense of humor like those at the Target retail
unit of Dayton Hudson Corp., who saluted shoppers' affectionate
references to ``Target'' stores by running ads carrying the theme
``C'est Target''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Couldn't someone at the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee have proofread a direct-mail solicitation letter that
sought opinions from New Yorkers on significant issues so their
responses could be shared with ``Senator Daniel Patrick Moyni''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Was it an accident that one recent morning on the cable
television system serving the Upper West Side of Manhattan, three
infomericals for compact disk collections were playing in
progressive sequence, so that Channel 50 peddled a collection of
music from the 1950s, Channel 51 the 1970s and Channel 52 the
1980s?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will the move by the Sunshine Biscuits unit of Keebler Foods
Co. to stop embossing the word ``sugar'' on its Vienna Fingers
sandwich cookies help millions of noshers turn trim?
</P>
<P>
   _ Did anyone at People magazine notice that an ad on page 91 of
the July 6 issue, showing a woman standing behind an X-ray machine
to promote the calcium content of the Total line of cereal sold by
General Mills, was nearly identical to an ad that appeared 12 pages
later, showing a boy standing behind an X-ray machine to promote
the calcium content of the Sunny Delight juice drink sold by
Procter &AMP; Gamble?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco unit of BAT Industries
promotes redesigned packages of Kool cigarettes with ads carrying
the headline ``NU look,'' will Northwestern University become
popular with smokers?
</P>
<P>
   _ When Hoechst AG decided to run an ad about its research on
Alzheimer's disease, which carried the headline ``Imagine being in
your 90s and still able to recite every word Springsteen ever
wrote,'' did someone remember to ask Bruce Springsteen about it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Wasn't it a marvelous moment of media convergence coincidence
when the Conde Nast Publications unit of Advance Publications
sponsored a newspaper ad supplement as part of a trade campaign
carrying the theme ``The accent is on content'' just as Steven
Brill was bringing out the first issue of Brill's Content magazine?
</P>
<P>
   _ As ``road rage'' continues to concern motorists, is it smart
for General Motors Corp. to promote the Chevrolet Monte Carlo Z34
by showing Taz, the Tasmanian devil cartoon character, in ads
carrying the headline ``Inside every Monte Carlo driver is a wild
side''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Now that Procter &AMP; Gamble has run newspaper ads in which the
company acknowledges that Crest Multicare toothpaste does not help
reduce and prevent gingivitis and reduce plaque while a competitive
brand, Colgate Total, does, can consumers look forward to
subsequent ads that are as scrupulously honest about the
shortcomings of other products?
</P>
<P>
   _ After The Wall Street Journal advised readers to visit ``the
legendary Nat King Cole bar'' at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan,
how many showed up and asked the pianist to play ``Unforgettable''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Are the Marlboro cigarette billboards in the Richmond, Va.,
area carrying the headline ``You get a lot to like'' _ a line from
one of the brand's early jingles _ a precursor of a retro-chic
national campaign from Philip Morris Cos. that would include a
concert tour by Julie London, who sang the jingles?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is a coupon for the Soft Scrub line of cleansers sold by
Clorox Co. that expires on ``April 31, 1998'' actually good
forever?
</P>
<P>
   _ If George Steinbrenner ever moves the New York Yankees from
Yankee Stadium, could disgruntled fans insist that the Lipton Brisk
tea commercial set there, which features him along with Babe Ruth,
Reggie Jackson, Mickey Mantle and Billy Martin, be re-edited to
show the rest of them clobbering him with their bats?
</P>
<P>
   _ Wasn't it classy of the Clairol unit of Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co. to pay a posthumous tribute to Shirley Polykoff, who created
the line ``Does she or doesn't she?'' for Clairol hair dyes?
</P>
<P>
   _ When executives of the U.S. Tobacco unit of UST Corp. decided
to promote Copenhagen Long Cut snuff with the slogan ``It
satisfies,'' wasn't there anyone there to remind them that
Chesterfield cigarettes were once sold with the slogan ``They
satisfy''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Will Marlon Brando, Gary Cooper, Marilyn Monroe and the other
Hollywood stars featured in a Levi's jeans campaign carrying the
theme ``Our models can beat up their models'' next start to
threaten an advertising columnist by warning him, ``You ask a lot
of questions for someone from Brooklyn''?

`THE SNAKE CHARMER': MAN BITES SNAKE AND PAYS THE PRICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: India)  (Eds: Publication notes at end of review.) 
(mk) 
 By RICHARD BERNSTEIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The snake charmer of Sanjay Nigam's title is a man named
Sonalal, and the designation is literal, not symbolic. Sonalal is
one of those wizened men who wait for the tourist buses in front of
Hamayun's tomb in New Delhi, playing tunes on a dried-out gourd
while a cobra rises out of a wicker basket. On the day that this
novel opens, Sonalal makes a mistake that changes the rest of his
life and out of which Nigam spins an engaging, light-as-a-feather
tale of a comically stubborn struggle for both moral absolution and
a few dollops of worldly pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Nigam, the dust jacket tells us, is an Indian-born physician and
medical researcher who now lives in Boston. Writing novels is, in
other words, a kind of avocation for him but one for which he
clearly has some talent. He has a deceptively simple, intentionally
naive style, one intended, it seems, to mimic the tradition of
Indian folk tales. But while his story of the Delhi streets zips
along like a bicycle rickshaw, it passes through what is actually
some pretty serious cultural and intellectual traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Nigam's Sonalal, illiterate and superstitious, is several
things: an illustration of the complexity of ordinary people, a
morally honest traveler through the shadowy landscape of
contemporary India, an afflicted Everyman, and an alienated artist
striving to gain recognition for an ignored masterpiece. It would
be sentimental to say that he achieves nobility in Nigam's
portrayal of him. Indeed, Nigam maintains a tender but never
sentimental narrative voice. But one does come to appreciate
Sonalal for the depth of his fractured humanity as well as for the
all-too-human quality of his frailty and foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   On the day that changes his life forever, Sonalal leaves home
early, his faithful co-performer, an aging cobra named Raju, curled
in its basket. An international sporting event, ``the Games,'' is
opening in New Delhi on this day, so business is particularly
brisk. When a group of foreign journalists arrives at Hamayun's
Temple, Sonalal, greedy for more rupees to be tossed in his
direction, pushes the tired and unwilling Raju through one more
performance. He plays ``variations on Raju's favorite tune, such
beautiful variations that, had they been recorded, might have
guaranteed Sonalal's immortality.'' Suddenly, however, the
exhausted Sonalal hits a false note, noticed only by Raju who,
enraged, strikes at the snake charmer's calf. And though the snake
was defanged and stripped of its poison glands, the bite throws
Sonalal into a paroxysm of anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sonalal felt no pity. His eyes became wild. He bent down,
grabbed the listless snake by the head and tail, and stretched it
to its full length.'' Then, while the astonished foreigners looked
on, he bit the snake in two, killing ``his eldest son,'' as he
thinks of Raju, and setting into motion his picaresque adventure in
search of penance and consolation.
</P>
<P>
   In India, of course, snake bites man is no story, but man bites
snake is a sensation. Sonalal, showered with money and attention by
the foreign journalists, becomes briefly rich and famous. But in
his way, Sonalal is morally superior to his unwarranted good
fortune, knowing that it is undeserved, based on an act of
momentary savagery. Sonalal feels guilty. He also worries that
Raju's mate will seek him out and murder him in vengeance. Sonalal
has bad dreams. He develops an unbearably bitter taste in his
mouth. He becomes impotent, even in the presence of his favorite
prostitute, Reena. He quarrels with Sarita, his long-suffering
wife. He starts uncontrollably biting his tongue. He seeks the help
of doctors whom Nigam, a doctor himself, portrays with satirical
panache.
</P>
<P>
   ``The universe is mysterious, unpredictable,'' Sonalal is told
by one of them, Dr. Seth. ``The mind of the Creator has endless
depth that cannot be completely fathomed even by great scientists
like Darwin, Freud, Einstein, and myself.'' Another doctor provides
a direct diagnosis. ``What's the matter with me, doctor sahib?
What?'' Sonalal asks. ``Dr. Basu looked Sonalal straight in the eye
and said, `It's called guilt.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nigam carries us quietly and unaffectedly through Sonalal's
trials, allowing his character to reveal himself as an entirely
earthbound figure capable of thoughts of the sublime. Sonalal
remembers the beauty of the music he played in the minutes just
before Raju's death and he wonders whether the gods were actually
playing it, or merely present as listeners during an act of human
genius. ``Can you understand what it's like to know greatness for
just a moment and then know that, no matter how hard you try, it
will never happen again?'' he asks Reena. He contemplates suicide
and attempts it by stuffing his mouth full of ground chili pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Sonalal, in short, is a marvelous creation, a captivating figure
of both strangeness and recognizability. If there is a fault in
Nigam's account of his adventures, it is that he strays here and
there into adorableness. Nigam minimizes the dark side or, more
accurately, holds it in check so that Sonalal's character never
carries him into full tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   The image that occurs and recurs throughout is that of the snake
that bites its own tail. Nigam uses the image in several clever and
unexpected ways, among them as a metaphor for a kind of second
chance he gives to Sonalal near the end of his story when the snake
charmer's modest history almost repeats itself. By then Nigam has
struck a poignant, almost elegiac tone made up in part of the
simple passage of time in the world he has created but also of the
sense that as India changes, the places, literal and metaphorical,
set aside for snake charmers like Sonalal will slowly disappear.

<P>
   There have been developments involving four large accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic Corp. named Zenith Media Services and Media Direct
Partners, both of New York, to handle its consolidated media buying
account, with billings estimated at $125 million to $200 million.
Those duties had been handled by various agencies including Zenith,
which is a joint venture of Cordiant Communications Group PLC and
Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi PLC.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a review that had also included Arnold
Communications in Boston, part of Snyder Communications, in
partnership with Draft Worldwide in Chicago, part of Interpublic
Group of Companies; TBWA Chiat/Day in New York, part of Omnicom
Group, and TN Media in New York, part of True North Communications.
</P>
<P>
   Fila USA Inc., part of Fila Holdings SpA, selected Leo Burnett
Co. in Chicago to handle its account, with billings estimated at
$15 million. The account had been handled for eight months by
Arnell Group Brand Consulting in New York until that agency and
Fila parted ways in March.
</P>
<P>
   Burnett was awarded the account after a four-month review that
also included the New York office of Fallon McElligott; Cliff
Freeman &AMP; Partners in New York, part of Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi; W.B.
Doner &AMP; Co. in Southfield, Mich., and Toth Design and Advertising
in Concord, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The Focus Agency in Dallas, owned by Omnicom, resigned the
consumer market account of Qwest Communications after only eight
months, attributing the decision to ``creative differences and the
direction of the relationship.'' The account was initially
described as having billings estimated at $50 million, but the
agency said that ``never materialized.'' Telephone calls to Qwest
executives seeking comment on whether a review would now begin were
not returned.
</P>
<P>
   And Dreyfus Corp. unit of Mellon Bank Corp. narrowed a review on
its account to three finalists from six semifinalists. The account,
with billings estimated at $12 million to $15 million, had been
handled for three years by Citron Haligman Bedecarre in San
Francisco until that agency and Dreyfus parted ways in April.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Roth, president of Richard Roth Consulting in Chappaqua,
N.Y., who is helping manage the review, identified the finalists,
all of New York, as: Partners &AMP; Shevack, part of Wolf Group, and
two agencies owned by Interpublic, Ammirati Puris Lintas and
Angotti, Thomas, Hedge. Three agencies in New York were eliminated
from the review: Bozell Worldwide, part of True North; Grace &AMP;
Rothschild, and Rapp Collins Worldwide, a unit of Omnicom. A
decision is expected by mid-August.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS Appoints Key Executive
</P>
<P>
   Lowe &AMP; Partners/SMS in New York, part of the Lowe Group unit of
Interpublic Group of Cos., has named William Sawyer managing
director of its San Francisco office. Sawyer, 44, joins from Wieden
&AMP; Kennedy in Portland, Ore., where he had been managing director of
the Amsterdam office and head of European operations. Sawyer
succeeds Bob Jeffrey, who left in March to become executive vice
president and managing director of J. Walter Thompson New York,
part of WPP Group PLC.

managed care programs that states and the federal government
promote as a means to provide good care while holding down the
cost. The retreat is most pronounced in Medicaid programs for the
poor. Managed care organizations like Aetna U.S. Healthcare,

GOLDEN GLOW SURROUNDS LONDON ART MARKET 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ On July 28, 1954, an English collector wandered into a
London art gallery and spent about $7,000 for a colorful Monet.
</P>
<P>
   The painting, ``Waterlily Pond and Path by the Water,'' was one
of six the artist had made of his water garden in Giverny in 1900.
Until it was offered for sale at Sotheby's here last week, it had
been hanging in that same collector's house for the last 44 years.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, in a hushed salesroom, five telephone bidders
battled for the painting; it ended up breaking previous records for
the artist anywhere, selling for a staggering $33 million, more
than three times its estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Sotheby's refused to give either the buyer's name
or his nationality. All they would say was that he wished to remain
anonymous.
</P>
<P>
   The high price paid for the Monet became something of a symbol
here as the most important weeks of the summer art season unfold.
Its importance was not that it was one of the highest prices ever
paid for a work of art in London, or that the painting was
extremely rare, since most of the artist's waterlilies are in
museums. It was a sign of strength for the London art market, which
has been increasingly unstable for several years.
</P>
<P>
   There is the perception in the art world that the United States
is where the big money is, and, therefore, it is to a seller's
advantage to send works of art to Manhattan for sale. Further
hampering the London art market is a 3-year-old import tax imposed
on works of art arriving in European Union countries. That tax can
make selling art cheaper in New York City, which has no such tax.
</P>
<P>
   Works of art from places like Switzerland (not a European Union
member) that would normally have gone straight to London for sale
now cross the Atlantic. Making matters worse for London is the
growing threat that it will soon be eclipsed by Paris, as the
French government is scheduled to open its auctions to non-French
auctioneers this fall. So the high price fetched for the Monet was
greeted here as proof that great art can sell anywhere. Since the
painting was already in England and the import tax was not an
issue, the owner, identified only as a member of an old English
family, was quite happy to take a gamble on the London auctions. He
proved to be right: by making it the star of the London sale, it
had little competition.
</P>
<P>
   (The previous world record for a Monet painting was ``Dans la
Prairie,'' which sold at Christie's in London in 1988 for $24.4
million.)
</P>
<P>
   Another domestic star was a 1918 Modigliani portrait of a Polish
emigre known only as Baranowski. The sellers were Sir Robert and
Lady Sainsbury, who decided to sell the portrait to raise money to
establish a department for Japanese cultural studies at the
University of East Anglia. Estimated to bring $6.6 million to $10
million, it sold to the Namad brothers, who run galleries in both
London and Manhattan, for $7.1 million. (Final prices include the
auction house's commission, 15 percent of the first $50,000 and 10
percent of the rest. Estimates do not reflect commissions.)
</P>
<P>
   It would be unfair to compare Sotheby's results with Christie's
because Sotheby's has stuck to the traditional format, selling
Impressionist and modern art in one sale and contemporary art
(works roughly dating from 1945 to the present) in another.
Christie's, however, has reclassified the way it sells art, pairing
19th-century and Impressionist works in a sale that took place here
two weeks ago. It performed poorly, in part because of the weak
offerings and because it was a week before the rest of the
auctions. The entire evening brought in only $19.3 million, about
$14 million less than the Monet alone sold for at Sotheby's.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's did hold what it now calls its sale of 20th-century
art last week. (Contemporary art, which it now defines as works
dating from 1970 to the present, was sold in the spring.) While
collectors are still finding it strange to see a Picasso next to a
David Hockney, good material there fetched reasonably strong
prices. A 1917 Klee, one of the few that the artist was able to
paint during World War I and estimated to sell for $330,000 to
$490,000, ended up selling to an unidentified European collector
for $1.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Today's buyer does his homework and when works are overpriced,
no one is fooled. Christie's tried to stir up interest in
Magritte's ``Enchanted Domain,'' a series of eight paintings made
in 1953, by putting one on the cover of its international magazine
and holding a cocktail party two nights before the sale. Waiters,
mimicking the artist's famous images, wore bowler hats and served
canapes like cloud-shaped crackers and green apples.
</P>
<P>
   The works, which were a study the artist made for ``The
Enchanted Domain,'' a mural in the Casino Communal at
Knokke-le-Zoute in Belgium, had been for sale recently as a group
both in Japan and New York. Christie's estimates when they split
them up were considered by experts to be far too high. The first
one sold for its high estimate, bringing $2.7 million, but of the
seven others, one failed to sell and the rest went for less than
their low estimates.
</P>
<P>
   One striking fact that emerged from these sales was the strength
of European buyers. ``In just the last three months, Europeans have
begun buying again,'' said Leslie Waddington, one of London's
leading modern and contemporary art dealers. This was certainly
true at Sotheby's sale of contemporary art on Thursday night, when
only two of the top 10 works for sale were bought by Americans.
</P>
<P>
   The same evening, just before its contemporary art auction
began, Sotheby's offered 49 works of German and Austrian art, and
Europeans bought of these as well. ``Seascape,'' a magical painting
by Gerhard Richter showing a turbulent sea and sky from 1970, sold
to Simon de Pury, a former chairman of Sotheby's in Europe who is
now a private dealer and art consultant, for $2.3 million, more
than three times its $664,000 high estimate.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the buyer for whom de Pury purchased the Richter was
not revealed. In fact, secrecy seemed to be even more evident at
these sales than it was in Manhattan in May and June. Most of the
buying took place over the phone. Even dealers in the salesroom
tried to be discreet. At Sotheby's sale of Impressionist and modern
art on Tuesday night, for instance, David Nash, a former Sotheby's
veteran who is now a New York dealer, was seen glued to a cellular
phone. He wasn't talking to his client, but instead was heard
bidding to Michel Strauss, Sotheby's chairman of Impressionist and
modern art, who was talking on a telephone only inches away.
</P>
<P>
   Nash was thought to be buying the Monet for Paul G. Allen, a
founder of the Microsoft Corp., who recently spent $12.1 million at
Sotheby's in Manhattan for another expensive Monet, ``Grand
Canal,'' a 1908 view of Venice. A Sotheby's representative from its
London office ended up taking the winning bid, also by telephone,
which only helped to fuel speculation that the painting might stay
in Britain.

A TEEN-AGE BASH WITH COOL OASES OF MATURITY 
</HEADLINE>
 (jw) 
 By BEN RATLIFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLMDEL, N.J. _ The many moods of a 14-year-old: vainglorious,
deluded-heroic, foolishly cathartic, cravenly rebellious, callowly
self-obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   If that's condescending, it's no more so than Ozzfest '98, the
touring bonanza for white suburban teen-age males, which had its
first United States stop here on Friday at the PNC Bank Arts
Center. Last year's Ozzfest was the second-highest-grossing concert
tour of the year, and if the socko turnout on Friday was
indicative, it might do excellent business again.
</P>
<P>
   Given that, you'd think an 11-hour day of heavy music _ it would
be mostly misleading to call it metal _ could provide a few more
diversions for $42.50 than tables of sex stuff for beginners
(magnetized face-studs, cheapo underwear, Trojan condom stations)
and a few slapped-together stands where one could throw a dumb dart
at a dumb balloon for a free CD.
</P>
<P>
   The music? Right, the music: Those who weren't marooned in
hourlong lines for soda and pretzels might have wished that the
music was less homogeneous.
</P>
<P>
   In Europe last month, the tour included Pantera, the Foo
Fighters and Black Sabbath. American audiences lost out on these
worthwhile acts: Most of the 16 entries on the bill were new bands
with their eye depressingly riveted on the main chance. At the
moment, that's a rap-metal fusion. The good aspects of the
Afro-Americanization of white-suburban-heavy music are mostly
theoretical (Rage Against the Machine, not on the bill, is a
complicated exception). In practice, Sevendust, Coal Chamber,
Kilgore and Limp Bizkit, all of whom played the festival, make
indistinguishably leaden songs that are all about the constant
whomping downstroke. They're shouting party bands with slightly
different levels of humor, anger or soul-searching spookiness, but
desperately thin musicality.
</P>
<P>
   Limp Bizkit, however, had the audience's number better than
perhaps any other band all day. Its lone stage prop was a
20-foot-high toilet. After berating the audience and himself,
crying in rhyming tantrums that nobody loves him, and raising minor
crowd eruptions by running up the middle of the amphitheater, Fred
Durst, the band's singer, hopped up on the rim of the toilet to
enact some king-sized bathroom humor. After that, cardboard cutouts
of Posh Spice and Zac Hanson popped up out of the bowl; he
ceremoniously depressed the giant lever to flush them back down,
yelling at them in turn (to the immense delight of the crowd) for
slatternliness and insufficient manliness.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the most committed heavy-metal singers become hippielike
with age, which lends their music a charge of humanism; with the
flick of a sensibility, music for children becomes music for
adults. The Brazilian band Soulfly, led by the dreadlocked singer
and guitarist Max Cavalera, formerly of Sepultura, floated out some
nonmetal musical concerns amid crunching guitars: he chanted Bob
Marley lines and flirted with pre-electric elements. Motorhead,
headlining the second stage with its simple and persuasive bar-band
metal, was the day's other dose of maturity. Lemmy Kilmister, 25
years into the job, continues on exactly the right path between
taking his music seriously and not at all. Both bands exuded a
hard-working cheer, which was lacking in Megadeth's perfectionist
but businesslike set.
</P>
<P>
   System of A Down, ranting about CIA conspiracies and chemical
corporations, showed that there were alternatives to solipsistic
anger in reaching the desired audience. The music was comparatively
captivating, too, using Arabic scales and suitelike structures.
Tool, whose participation may be the most crucial to the festival,
had the benefit of being the one mysterious band on the bill. Its
riffs lingered rather than pounded; its singer, Maynard James
Keenan, appeared bare-chested, in white face paint and thick-soled
shoes, and he writhed spasmodically as he sang xenophobic character
sketches and songs of ritual violence. If you buy Keenan, you buy
him completely, and you buy him as a tortured artist.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, there was Ozzy Osbourne, the Grandpa Munster of hard
rock, a smiling, harmless creature onto whom one may now project
anything so long as it keeps him in the Ozzy business. As if to
prove his free-agentry, his show was preceded by a short sequence
of music videos and film clips into which Osbourne had been edited
and superimposed. We saw him being sketched in the nude by Leonardo
DiCaprio in ``Titanic''; cavorting rudely through videos by Hanson,
the Spice Girls and Fiona Apple (for the benefit of the boys in the
crowd who hate their sisters); killing Kenny in a short slice of
``South Park,'' and finally in Jack Nicholson's place, axing his
way through the door in ``The Shining.'' The man himself finally
appeared behind a screen in a great silhouette; he raised his hands
for a mass benediction and stuck out his middle fingers.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was standard-issue Ozzy, a mixture of Black
Sabbath songs and latter-day music of his solo career by a good,
young four-piece band. Osbourne was in fine voice and repeatedly
urged the crowd to go crazy, spraying water at the front rows with
a hose. Compared with the sure-footed, macho plodders on his tour,
he moves lightly and comically; he clapped his hands as if calling
a square dance, batted his eyelashes vacantly, performed jumping
jacks. He was genuinely funny. To what other crowd but teen-agers,
battered by hours of same-sounding music, could Ozzy Osbourne
become an oasis of comedic warmth?

A PERFORMING ARTS CENTER TAKES A BOW 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RONALD SMOTHERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Pronouncing their first season a rousing artistic
success, officials of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center said
the center had attracted a large and broad-based audience of half a
million people since its opening in October and was sparking
interest in revitalizing downtown Newark.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of incipient new life in the city, which even the most
optimistic said would take years to materialize, include more than
the four new restaurants growing up in the center's shadow or the
milling crowds outside the building on show nights. Officials have
cited recent purchases of nearby office towers and plans to acquire
downtown properties for redevelopment as a turn-of-the-century
village by a new foundation financed by Prudential Insurance Co. A
minor-league baseball stadium is under construction and the
long-stalled plans for a $75 million riverfront esplanade have been
revived with the promise of federal assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was wrong in my prediction,'' said a smiling Lawrence
Goldman, executive director of the performing arts center, as he
recalled his suggestion only last summer that it would be at least
two years before redevelopment began to spread from the 12-acre
site of the $180 million center.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the center cannot yet claim to have altered the cultural
landscape of the metropolitan area, as some grandly predicted it
would. Attendance at Lincoln Center and Carnegie Hall in New York
City has not suffered noticeably because of New Jersey defections.
And officials of other performing arts and presenting groups said
the center has not fostered their fortunes in a state where
donations to the arts have remained static.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the audience figures and the filling of 82 percent of
its seats over 357 performances in 244 days that was most
encouraging to Goldman and others. It suggested that the center's
first season, which ended June 30, was working. Offerings included
a broad mix of classical programs with top performers, popular
artists like Bob Dylan and David Copperfield, Broadway touring
companies of ``Annie'' and ``Grease,'' and nontraditional and often
risky fare from Portugal, Latin America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Attendance exceeded projections by 100,000. Of the half million
visitors to the center, with its soaring glass facade and red-brick
walkways, 26 percent were members of minorities, according to
surveys by the arts center. And while 29 percent were from Newark
and surrounding Essex County, 70 percent were from suburban areas
in Bergen, Union, Morris and Middlesex Counties.
</P>
<P>
   As the new home of the New Jersey Symphony, the center has
seemingly unleashed a lot of pent up demand. Subscribers for the
touring state symphony's Newark series, which until last season had
been held in Symphony Hall, quadrupled from 2,100 to 8,600, said
Lawrence Tamburri, executive director of the orchestra. Some of the
new subscribers were people who usually patronized symphony
programs in scattered sites around the state.
</P>
<P>
   The results, Goldman said, have ``shattered the two negatives''
that shadowed the center's birth as an idea more than a decade ago:
that it would not attract suburbanites back to downtown Newark and
that blacks and Hispanics who make up the majority of the city
would not be drawn to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers tell us that we have succeeded in being a
statewide performing arts center,'' he said, ``and succeeded in our
ambition to throw open the doors to new audiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Stern, an Englewood dentist and longtime subscriber to the
symphony, also praised the new center but lamented the loss of some
of the annual performances by the orchestra in the John Harms
Center for the Arts in his hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were sort of cultural room service coming to Englewood,
but the truth is that I probably won't travel a lot for room
service,'' he said, noting that he was likely to use the time it
takes to go to Newark to travel to Lincoln Center for superior
fare.
</P>
<P>
   While some of the apparent success could be the honeymoon
effect, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center's first season
results, particularly in attracting members of minorities, is
drawing some approving and somewhat amazed nods from its peers
around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Wilker, president of the Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts in Washington, called the 26 percent minority
attendance ``really good and a testament to the way they have
marketed themselves and removed barriers.'' The New Jersey center,
he said, seemed to have avoided the label of an elitist institution
from the outset.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Szakacs, the marketing director of the Playhouse Square
Foundation in Cleveland, called the first-season results for the
New Jersey venue ``impressive'' and ``wonderful'' in terms of
drawing new audiences and promoting arts education through
community programs.
</P>
<P>
   A Bellwether For Arts Patrons
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey Performing Arts Center is being watched closely
for how well it does in holding traditional audiences for the arts,
creating new audiences and weaving itself into the fabric of a
city's life, said Steve Wolff, president of AMS Planning and
Research in Fairfield, Conn., an arts management and audience
survey company. AMS has done consulting work for the performing
arts center and many of the 28 centers around the country that,
like Newark's, are in large urban areas and not affiliated with a
university.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have made it an inviting place and as such the New Jersey
center is very much one of the new models of performing arts
centers,'' Wolff said. ``In the first three or four years of
performing arts centers there is a lot of learning going on. And
the early returns certainly suggest that they have done a lot of
things really right.''
</P>
<P>
   Examples of how the center has woven itself into life here
beyond the performances it presents have been evident recently. On
two days last December it held performances of ``Cinderella'' by
the American Ballet Theater in the 2,800-seat Prudential Hall, a
Kwanzaa program in the 514-seat Victoria Theater, a bar mitzvah in
one of the smaller halls, and the annual cotillion of the Essex
County Links, a black service group.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In June, Newark's Science High School held its graduation at the
center. And early last month, one of the state's premiere law
firms, Sills Cummis Zuckerman Radin Tischman Epstein &AMP; Gross,
rented the Victoria Theater, where James Carville and Mary Matalin
entertained about 400 of the firm's prized clients. The event
replaced its annual golf outing to a suburban country club.
</P>
<P>
   Events like these are signs that the Newark center is a place to
commemorate important events in people's lives, as much a community
center as a cultural pavilion, Wolff said.
</P>
<P>
   This status has much to do with the 101,000 children, parents
and educators who have been served by special daytime performances
or the more than 15 arts-training performance development programs,
said Philip Thomas, vice president for arts education at the
center.
</P>
<P>
   But it is also the result of a mix of programming that has tried
to balance the traditional, the popular and the unusual. Stephanie
Hughley, vice president for programming, noted that among the
seasons sellouts were Itzhak Perlman, the New Jersey Symphony's
``Carmina Burana,'' Isaac Stern, Yo Yo Ma and Emanuel Ax with the
Laredo Quartet. Other sellouts were B.B. King, the Alvin Ailey
American Dance Theater, Bob Dylan, David Copperfield and the Harlem
Nutcracker.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman noted two setbacks. For one, they discovered too late
that there was little appetite for opera on Monday nights among the
4.6 million New Jerseyans within a 25-mile radius. They also found
to their disappointment that some of the lucrative pop acts see no
need to book performances in Newark if they are booking New York
City.
</P>
<P>
   But what he and Ms. Hughley seemed the most proud of was the
past season's World Festival. To reach out to Newark's and northern
New Jersey's sizable Portuguese-American community, the festival
featured performers from Portuguese-speaking countries around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   It was a risk artistically, said Ms. Hughley, because although
the performers were excellent artists who were popular in their
home countries of Mozambique, Portugal or Cape Verde, they were not
known here. Though some of the programs were not as well attended
as anticipated, they did bring in varied audiences and had
unquantifiable effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we created a safe space for people to come and see
things that they wouldn't go to see in other places,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Next season's World Festival will focus on pan-African works,
including a stage adaptation of ``Things Fall Apart,'' a book by
the Nigerian writer Chinua Achebe, and will introduce American
audiences to ``Waramba,'' the French and Mandenka-language opera
from Ivory Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors at other performance halls in the state look at the
New Jersey Performing Arts Center's first season with mixed
feelings. Their initial fears about the Newark center's impact on
their audiences was offset by hopes that they would get a benefit
from its programming and that it would raise the level of donations
for cultural events statewide, said David Rodriguez, director of
the 1,300-seat John Harms Center in Englewood.
</P>
<P>
   Neither of those things has happened, he said, but nor do
neighboring stages think they have lost audiences to the center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said that they would be a catalyst for greater arts
giving in the state,'' said Rodriguez, ``but the pot of money for
the performing arts has not increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Englewood center and the State Theater in New Brunswick
lost a portion of their New Jersey Symphony dates to the
orchestra's new home base in Newark, but officials of both centers
said that their overall subscription programs had not suffered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of single ticket sales, but we saw an increase
in our subscriptions,'' said David Fleming, director of the State
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   A Catalyst For Urban Rebirth
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, there has been almost unalloyed enthusiasm about
how the center is affecting revitalization in downtown Newark. One
clear indication of this was the recent municipal elections in
which some candidates who might have been expected to contrast the
resources lavished on the center with the amount focused on the
neighborhood chose not to do so. Instead, most sought to associate
themselves with the center's success and trumpet its possibilities
for a broader renewal.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James, who called the rash of new development plans
unequivocally an outgrowth of the success of the performing arts
center's first season, has reorganized the city government's
economic development arm to package development plans and
incentives better, as well as to steer some of the expected new
largess to local neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   Among its tasks will be to review the plans of Prudential's New
Newark Foundation, whose conceptual planner is Tony Goldman, a New
York real estate developer who is not related to Lawrence Goldman,
the performing arts center's president. Tony Goldman, who helped
reshape Miami's South Beach into an Art Deco tourist magnet, has
been eyeing downtown Newark for clues to what he calls the city's
soul and ways to link it to the $180 million arts center.
</P>
<P>
   ``They created this fabulous cultural center and want it to be
an economic and inspirational stimulus for the downtown of the
state's largest city,'' he said of the public and private forces
that built the center. ``I was asked to come in and help stimulate
things so that this initiative wouldn't be hanging out there as an
oasis, a passive thing, in a development desert.''

THE FUTURE OF THE INTERNET: ONE PIECE OR MANY? 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although the proposed acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. by
AT&AMP;T was almost as full of unlikely promises as the cable giant's
notoriously unfulfilled plans to merge with the Bell Atlantic Corp.
in 1993, the reaction of the news media has matured. The former
frenzy has given way to the kind of skepticism that only five years
of Internet-driven market chaos could have inspired.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, not much has been said about how the deal will affect
one of the most vibrant new industries that now finds itself
directly in AT&AMP;T's path: the largely local, independent Internet
service providers, or ISP's.
</P>
<P>
   The service provider industry includes more than 4,000
companies, according to Boardwatch Magazine, each of which serves
as a gateway to the global Internet and all of which, in concert,
transfer trillions of bits of data around the world every day.
</P>
<P>
   Service providers range from tiny companies serving a couple of
hundred customers to the gargantuan Worldcom Inc., which owns three
of the largest such services _ Uunet, ANS and the network services
of Compuserve _ and also controls the biggest portion of the
``Internet backbone,'' the high-speed, high-capacity fiber optic
cables, routers and national access points to which smaller service
providers are connected.
</P>
<P>
   The service provider industry is already being consolidated.
Even before the AT&AMP;T deal, it had been expected to shrink to as few
as 100 companies over the next three to four years.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever other impact consolidation might have, as more control
of Internet access moves into the hands of fewer and larger
companies, there is a growing fear among industry watchers that the
larger, more powerful access providers may end up tearing the
Internet to pieces in a competitive frenzy of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Small access providers lease connections from larger ones and
from backbone owners. Because no single company or group owns or
controls the Internet, these competing access providers move data
over the global network by a cooperative arrangement called
peering, whereby they agree to send one another's data through
their own networks without charge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a weird business, where companies compete and cooperate
at the same time,'' said Bill McCarthy, managing editor of
Boardwatch, which follows the Internet access industry and
publishes a directory of access providers twice a year.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy is not among the analysts who think that AT&AMP;T's new
push into the consumer Internet market via At Home, the high-speed
cable modem business owned in part by TCI, will mortally wound
smaller access providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them don't want to deal with consumers anyhow,'' he
said, and those who do will be compelled to provide a higher level
of customer hand-holding than big companies are willing to offer.
</P>
<P>
   But McCarthy is more wary of another possible outcome of a
further consolidation of Internet access into a few large
companies: that for the sake of competition, big access providers
will stop cooperating with competitors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big fear is that if one company decides not to peer with
other networks, then you no longer have an Internet,'' McCarthy
said. ``You have separate networks, connected to one company's
infrastructure but not to the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy's point of view, though not necessarily his degree of
concern, is shared by one of the founding fathers of the Internet,
Robert Kahn, who helped develop the set of protocols, or computer
communication rules, that gave birth to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Until the commercial Internet was born, Kahn said, there was
always a way to ``bootstrap'' everyone to the same level of
service. Everyone can send and receive e-mail, for example, and get
files and Web pages using standard Internet protocols.
</P>
<P>
   But when a big access provider starts to provide enhanced,
proprietary services _ ``like Internet video, for an extreme
example,'' he said _ it creates a fragmentation that until now was
unheard of on today's largely homogenous Internet and World Wide
Web. In fact, it would return us to the kind of America Online,
Compuserve and Prodigy models that existed before the Internet
became the great digital melting pot _ islands of on-line services
that were incapable of interaction with one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be a stupid thing to do by our measure,'' McCarthy
acknowledged. ``Breaking up the Internet would defeat the
purpose.'' But he added, `` `Stupid' doesn't mean it's not going to
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Kahn is relatively circumspect about such a trend. ``There's so
much in flux today that what you think is today's problem might
look like ancient history,'' he said. ``These are serious issues,
but you have to keep them in perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   But for McCarthy, solving today's problem _ especially regarding
access providers and peering _ is crucial for tomorrow's Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm AT&AMP;T and you've got a little $20,000 network, why
should I allow you to use my network for free, rather than be my
customer?'' he said. ``But by allowing me to choose which role you
play, I can literally choose my competitors and create a role for
myself as a dominant player.''
</P>
<P>
   This rather remarkable ability could become a cause for alarm
if, as McCarthy asserts, all access providers, big and small, are
moving in the same strategic direction as Worldcom and AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're all trying to provide the complete digital pipe so you
can get all your services _ local telephone, long distance, Web
services, video, and any other data services you might need _ all
at once,'' he said. ``With that in mind, the industry had better
set down some rules about this, or the government will do it for
them.''

EYES ON THE ENQUIRER IN COSBY CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By CHRISTIAN BERTHELSEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Trial watchers here are saying People of the State
of California vs. Mikail Markhasev may not have come to pass were
it not for The National Enquirer.
</P>
<P>
   In the prosecution of Markhasev, the man accused of killing Bill
Cosby's son, Ennis, there have been two critical pieces of
evidence: a .38-caliber Taurus revolver said to be the murder
weapon and a series of letters the prosecutors say the defendant
wrote after his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Both were uncovered with the help of The Enquirer. It offered a
$100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of Ennis Cosby's killer, going beyond the media's
traditional role of announcing rewards offered by others to
actually becoming a direct player.
</P>
<P>
   The offer prompted a witness, Chris So, to lead police to the
Taurus revolver, found wrapped in a stocking cap that investigators
have tied to Markhasev by DNA testing of a hair. Copies of the jail
house letters, in which the prosecution says Markhasev describes
the Cosby killing as a robbery gone bad, were first sent to The
Enquirer; the paper notified the Los Angeles Police Department,
which obtained the originals from jail.
</P>
<P>
   The Enquirer's reward has posed troubling questions: Does it
undermine the credibility of the government witness by allowing the
defense to argue, as it has, that he was motivated by financial
gain? And does it encourage crime witnesses to hold out for the
biggest payday before cooperating with authorities? Those are
issues The Enquirer's editor in chief, Steve Coz, said he
considered before offering the reward as well as the publicity and
additional scoops it would generate.
</P>
<P>
   Coz said the reward was first suggested by Bill Cosby himself,
and The Enquirer posted it because of a cooperative relationship it
has had with the entertainer over the years. David Brokaw,
spokesman for the Cosby family, confirmed the relationship but said
relations soured after a subsequent story about Camille Cosby's
reaction to her son's death.
</P>
<P>
   Coz said police and prosecutors supported the reward. While
recognizing the potential inducement for embellishment, Coz said
that the police investigation backed up So's tip and that he did
not think the reward offer would have a longer-lasting negative
impact on the justice system.
</P>
<P>
   ``You kind of have to look at justice as something that always
manages to rise to the top, through police work, through The
Enquirer,'' Coz said. ``Justice always seems to prevail in these
cases.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that the tabloid's sleuthing has earned the media any
appreciation from the courts or the prosecutors in the Cosby
matter. Judges have gone to extraordinary lengths to keep the press
at bay. Rather than following the usual practice of holding a
public preliminary hearing to determine whether Markhasev should be
bound over for trial, prosecutors presented the case to a grand
jury convened in private, and transcripts of the sessions were
ordered sealed. A gag order has been imposed on all lawyers and
parties in the case, and television and still cameras have been
banned in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   This is not The Enquirer's first time as a player in a
high-profile case. During the O.J. Simpson civil case, it obtained
photographs of Simpson wearing the same type of shoes that left
bloody tracks in the Brentwood condominium where his wife, Nicole
Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Goldman, were killed.
(Simpson was acquitted of murder charges but found liable for
wrongful death in a civil case.)
</P>
<P>
   Marshall Loeb, editor of The Columbia Journalism Review, said he
generally opposes rewards. ``It gives a news organization an
investment in the story,'' he said, ``and it tempts the news
organization to give the story more play _ bigger splashier
headline, bigger splashier photos, bigger splashier stories _ than
they otherwise would.''
</P>
<P>
   Keith Woods, a teacher of media ethics at the Poynter Institute
for Media Studies in St. Petersburg, Fla., said The Enquirer's
reward does not threaten the credibility of the news media because,
he added, the publication does not have credibility anyway. As long
as the practice does not spread to the mainstream media, it is not
a significant issue, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Laurie Levenson, a law professor at Loyola Law School who is
following the case, argues that The Enquirer's ability to break
these cases is actually enhancing its reputation. ``It's making
them a player in criminal cases,'' she said. ``They're able to
break criminal cases that no one else can; they're able to get
evidence that no one else can. You may not like them, but they get
the job done.''

CLINTON'S VISIT TO CHINA TIES PROSPERITY TO PERSONAL FREEDOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY HEASTER  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED: This Independence Day is particularly significant in
light of how President Clinton's historic trip to China has
re-emphasized the symbiosis of political freedom and economic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The ostensible reason for the president's China expedition was
to exert moral suasion to encourage a kinder and gentler approach
to governance and international relations. Clinton's strategic
approach, however, focused on the economic rewards China could
expect to reap by liberalizing the way it conducts its political
business.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Clinton never would have risked so much of his own
political capital by visiting China unless he was convinced that
overwhelming U.S. economic self-interest also was at stake. Thus,
the subliminal theme of the exercise seemed to be that political
and economic freedom go hand in hand and prosperity isn't possible
without personal liberty.
</P>
<P>
   This is the great universal truism of humankind's existence. The
best recent example of why the impoverishing nature of
authoritarian government cannot endure was the disintegration of
the former Soviet Union and its communist-style socialism. As
Soviet citizens came to learn how much better relatively free
people lived, it was only a matter of time until the system's
political center collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As an essay in Investor's Business Daily pointed out recently,
the purpose of economic activity is to provide opportunities for
exchange in pursuit of material well-being. Such activity is by its
nature individualistic and its success depends on personal freedom.
</P>
<P>
   The problem with authoritarian and totalitarian governments is
that they deprive individuals of the freedom to pursue their
self-interest by making spontaneous economic exchanges at will.
Instead, a relatively few powerful bureaucrats assume the power to
make generalized economic decisions for the many. Those decisions
always are made to serve the interests of the powerful few and
their power is the coin of the realm.
</P>
<P>
   The authoritarian can't abide economic freedom because it
invariably leads to political freedom. This is why impoverished
totalitarian regimes such as North Korea and Cuba must go to
excruciating lengths to keep outside reality from making itself
known.
</P>
<P>
   China's leaders seem to understand that such isolation is
possible only with small areas and populations and that Beijing
can't duplicate it without risking the same fate that befell the
Soviet Union. Thus, China's search now is for a middle ground that
will allow retention of as much authoritarian power as possible
while advancing economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   China's invitation to Clinton was a risk for its leaders, too,
but one they had to take. China can't prosper without expanding its
global economic options, and its leaders probably can't retain
power without achieving prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   Nobel laureate Milton Friedman understands the interdependence
of political and economic freedom better than most economists.
Friedman and his wife, Rose, have just completed their memoirs, Two
Lucky People, in which they reaffirm their lifelong commitment to
``the promotion of human freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to predict how much the president's visit will
advance the cause of political and economic freedom in China. It
did make an important contribution, though, because it set the
stage for a new era in political and economic relations between the
two countries.

PRIVATE'S POETRY REVEALS EMOTIONS AND IMAGES OF WORLD WAR I 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HOLLINGSWORTH  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDEPENDENCE, Mo. _ The verse, scratched in pencil 80 years ago,
has faded, but the images that rise from the words are still fresh.
</P>
<P>
   Back with the teams, back to the rear,
</P>
<P>
   Driver and horse, not wanted here...
</P>
<P>
   Soon a shell bursts, two drivers reel,
</P>
<P>
   Two saddles bar, swing and wheel.
</P>
<P>
   Written amid the mud and mayhem of World War I, the words George
Hamby stored in a little green journal are a mix of the high-minded
patriotism of the day and the gripes of a 20-year private about
army life.
</P>
<P>
   Hamby didn't have a high school diploma, and some of his lines
don't rhyme, but he clearly had the heart of a poet. He filled page
after page of grid paper with the emotions and images of the
conflict around him.
</P>
<P>
   All that might have died with him two years ago, but his
companion, Bessie Hines, decided to show the journal to The Kansas
City Star. It might make a good Fourth of July item, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hamby returned from France, she said, settled in Independence
and became a welder. There is no evidence that he ever wrote
another lyric in his life.
</P>
<P>
   His six long poems described the ``hell'' of war, the German
shells and fronts he fought on. He wrote proudly of his ``brave
comrades'' of E Battery, part of the 35th Division, the same
division in which a future president named Harry Truman served.
</P>
<P>
   A soldier's gripes also came through in the poetry _ too many
bugs and too little good food, such as when he complains about the
``belly rubbers convention.''
</P>
<P>
   It's composed of a mess sergeant and a cook or two,
</P>
<P>
   Who could stand a few lessons about making a stew,
</P>
<P>
   They draw butter and jam, which they put on the shelve,
</P>
<P>
   They don't put it out for they eat it themselves.
</P>
<P>
   During the war, soldiers commonly wrote letters or poetry, as
Hamby did, to reflect on the pains and more amusing points of Army
life, said Doran Cart, director and curator of the Liberty Memorial
Museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these fellows, especially the Americans, had never
left home before, and they were in France in the World War,'' Cart
said. ``They were seeking some way of expressing what they were
going through, what they were thinking and hearing.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of the other 27,500 soldiers from Missouri and Kansas
who went to France with the 35th Division, Hamby risked his life
before he had much of a chance to live it.
</P>
<P>
   At 19, he had said goodbye to family, friends and a fiancee and
joined up for the ``war to end all wars.''
</P>
<P>
   Slip of a boy, little but true,
</P>
<P>
   Trained half a year, fighting for you,
</P>
<P>
   Light as a twig, not twenty-one,
</P>
<P>
   But fitted to drive in the lead of the gun.
</P>
<P>
   He turned 20 a month before his first battle. In late September
1918, his division, as part of the American First Army, headed into
battle between the Meuse River and Argonne Forest in France. A
victory would take away the Germans' control of a railroad line on
which they received vital supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the 26th,
</P>
<P>
   About four twenty-five,
</P>
<P>
   Hell broke loose up in the hills,
</P>
<P>
   Then they began the drive.
</P>
<P>
   For three long hours we shelled them,
</P>
<P>
   Without a single stop,
</P>
<P>
   Our dough boys awaited a given hour,
</P>
<P>
   And poured out over the top.''
</P>
<P>
   Hamby later would talk about pushing the artillery pieces into
firing position, Hines said. He also recalled delivering messages
between outfits, including one trip when a shell killed the horse
he was riding but left him uninjured. Another time, he recounted:
</P>
<P>
   At two we were silently eating,
</P>
<P>
   Out there in the slimy mud,
</P>
<P>
   When the silence was suddenly broken,
</P>
<P>
   By the falling of a dud,
</P>
<P>
   For the benefit of the ignorant,
</P>
<P>
   I'll try and explain a bit,
</P>
<P>
   A dud is only a german shell,
</P>
<P>
   With the hell taken out of it.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 1, 1918, the 35th Division was relieved and placed in
reserve because of casualties of up to 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The division re-entered the front line weeks later, not far from
the bloody fields of Verdun, ``on the front that was known to be
hell.''
</P>
<P>
   Our next advance was the same as usual,
</P>
<P>
   We had them on the run,
</P>
<P>
   What else was there for them to do,
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees hell had come,
</P>
<P>
   On November the 10th it wasn't so bad,
</P>
<P>
   And not so good at that,
</P>
<P>
   But for every one the Huns sent over,
</P>
<P>
   We sent them eleven back.
</P>
<P>
   The next day was the Armistice.
</P>
<P>
   Before coming home to Independence, Hamby collected the names
and addresses of soldiers who lived in the Midwest, especially in
the Kansas City area. He listed them at the end of his journal.
</P>
<P>
   Hamby never married the girl he left when he went to war. She
died of influenza while he was away.
</P>
<P>
   A steelworker and welder for 35 years, he outlived two wives and
never had children. Hamby died in 1995 at age 97 and was buried
with a military funeral at Green Lawn Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Hines, his companion until his death, said Hamby would captivate
people, especially younger generations, with his stories of how he
shook hands with the Germans at the end of the war and how deep he
would sink into the shell-churned mud.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could really tell those tales.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines, 82, said Hamby came across his poems one day and gave
them to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was funny that he could sit in that foxhole and
write those poems about the war,'' she said. ``When I read it, I
said, `How could you write that sitting in a foxhole, men dying all
around you?' And he said, `Well, I did it.'''

 &HT;    All-Star derby features big bat of McGwire
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ As Mark McGwire's traveling home-run show appears in
Denver tonight for the annual All-Star Game home run derby, the
burning baseball question is not if he will break Roger Maris'
single-season home run record of 61, but when.
</P>
<P>
   Late August, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, cautions Henry Aaron, who hit more homers than
anyone in the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I think if anybody has a chance to do it, he can,''
Aaron said. ``But the whole key will be going into that last month
well ahead of Maris' pace. If he's not six or so homers ahead of
the pace, I don't think he can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire is two homers ahead of the pace, but Aaron thinks things
will get tougher for the St. Louis Cardinals' first baseman.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure and the teams he will be facing,'' Aaron
explained. ``If he is facing contending teams, they are not going
to pitch to him. And the television exposure. I know what it is
like, and it is worse now. It was very testy for Maris when he did
it. I remember my encounter. You get the same question over and
over again, and you get them from people who don't know anything
about the game. It's going to very interesting to see if he can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   McGwire said he plans to relax and enjoy the All-Star
festivities, beginning with tonight's home run derby. He'll be
free-swinging at Coors Field, the homer-friendliest park in the big
leagues, and he'll be competing against some of the best home run
hitters in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the best part of the All-Star Game,'' said McGwire, who
won the event in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   And the best part of the first half of the season certainly has
been McGwire. His 37 homers have traveled almost 15,392 feet (three
miles), an average of 416 feet a shot. He has filled ballparks in
both leagues, made pre-game batting practice a social gathering,
damaged scoreboards, hit balls through stadium doors, and hit three
homers in one game at Veterans Stadium in Philadelphia that
traveled a combined 1,362 feet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very fitting Godzilla is opening this week; I think it
opened a day early in Philly,'' said Philadelphia center fielder
Doug Glanville, who later complained of a sore neck.
</P>
<P>
   That is just one of many McGwire stories that have developed
during the first half of the season:
</P>
<P>
   _ THE SHOW: Opposing parks are opening their gates early to let
fans watch McGwire take batting practice. It has been routine for
25,000 fans to gather in St. Louis several hours before gametime.
NBC announcer Bob Costas took his son, Keith, to see batting
practice in St. Louis recently, and McGwire responded by hitting 22
of 25 pitches out of the park.
</P>
<P>
   The Padres drew 30,000 for McGwire's batting practice. Cardinals
catcher Tom Pagnozzi summed the moment: ``I saw something like this
on TV when I was a kid. I think they called themselves the
Beatles.''
</P>
<P>
   In Houston, the left-field bleachers were filled 90 minutes
before the game. McGwire hit four balls into the fourth deck of the
Astrodome, sending so many fans fighting for the balls that police
had to be called to restore order.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE PROMOTIONS: Despite being five games under .500 and 11 1/2
games out of first place, the Cardinals are averaging 37,971 a
game. If McGwire hits a home run into a certain section of the
upper deck in the left-field bleachers _ the McDonald's promotion
calls it ``Big Mac Land'' _ fans get free hamburgers. On a night
when attendance was 47,549, McGwire hit the spot, leaving McDonalds
facing the possibility of handing out $95,000 worth of free Big
Macs. On the day after the game, lines were 60 deep for hours at
the area stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you, this was the most unbelievable ticket-stub
turn-in we ever had,'' said John McCook, owner of four St. Louis
franchises.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE FANS: When McGwire hit three home runs in a game against
Arizona on April 14, Debbie Durrwater crawled across the dugout to
give him a high five. ``They escorted me out promptly,'' she said.
``It was worth it, though. I have good karma with him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Kansas City, 38,000 Royals fans stood to cheer when McGwire
walked to the plate. Kansas City and St. Louis are heated rivals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how he does it,'' Cardinals second baseman Delino
Deshields said. ``He signs more than a thousand pieces of
memorabilia a day. Fans come to see him take batting practice. And
they sometimes boo if he doesn't hit a home run. I don't know if I
would like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week in Cincinnati, more than 50,000 fans, double the Reds'
average attendance, came to see McGwire. Flashbulbs went off every
time he walked to the plate. Fans booed when he was walked twice
and hit by a pitch.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE COVERAGE: One radio station in Houston broadcasted a live
account of McGwire's batting practice, in which he hit nine homers.
``Ridiculous,'' he said. ``I felt like a caged lion and didn't like
it.'' McGwire then considered not taking batting practice for the
rest of the season. He reconsidered.
</P>
<P>
   But the stress level is increasing. After McGwire hit No. 32 in
another Cardinals' loss, he was repeatedly asked about the home
run.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just lost a game, so why talk about a home run?'' McGwire
asked. ``Why is hitting a home run important to the American
public?''
</P>
<P>
   _ THE FEARS: Third base coach Rene Lachemann said he's not
trying to make a spectacle of himself by leaving the coaching box
and standing down the left-field line during McGwire's at-bats.
``I'm trying to save my life,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   _ THE DAMAGE:
</P>
<P>
   McGwire hit a massive home run against the Twins that almost
scraped the Metrodome roof. ``It was up there so long my neck
started to hurt,'' Twins manager Tom Kelly said.
</P>
<P>
   On May 16 at Busch, McGwire hit a ball 545 feet to center field
that put a dent in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch sign. Two days
later, a 4 1/2-foot Band-Aid covered the spot. He also hit one off
the concrete facade above the Stadium Club in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people up there in that Stadium Club were ducking,''
Marlins coach Rich Donnelly said. ``If that ball had hit the
window, it would have knocked a few turkey-clubs across the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Donnelly best sums the McGwire phenomena by issuing a
warning for Denver-based aviation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With certain teams, those air-traffic controllers ought to be
on alert right now,'' Donnelly said. ``Bring in that 747 _ and here
comes a McGwire on Runway No. 7.''
</P>
<P>
   Big Mac lands in Denver tonight. But his homers . . . well, they
may land in Wyoming.

 &HT;    Corrections department look to corporate sector for helpBy
Rhonda Cook
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The Georgia prison system is moving into uncharted
waters with the addition of three privately-run prisons, an
operation that other states have found troubling.
</P>
<P>
   But the Georgia Department of Corrections has no reservations
about its new venture that starts in mid August with a 750-bed
prison on the edge of the Okefenokee Swamp.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to overreact,'' said Mike Murdock, who is
overseeing the project for the state.
</P>
<P>
   Several states that have hired corporate America to house their
criminals have had some problems, some of them dangerous _ but that
doesn't bother officials at the Georgia Department of Corrections.
Georgia is convinced it has all bases covered.
</P>
<P>
   With one false start behind it after one company won a bid last
year and then withdrew, Georgia signed contracts with two companies
to build and operate three private prisons in South Georgia _ one
with Cornell Corrections Corp. for a prison in Charlton County,
Ga., near the Okefenokee, and the other with Corrections Corp. of
American for prisons in South Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of communities, especially those that are economically
depressed, have been sold a bill of goods that's not accurate,''
said Rebecca Feaster of the American Federation of State, County
and Municipal Employees, which has opposed private prisons in
several states.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very enticing situation but people need to be aware
they aren't going to get the cost savings and they will be stuck
with a lot of bills,'' Feaster said. ``The prisoners that are
brought in are a lot more dangerous and the jobs they (local
residents) are getting are lower paying and there is a huge
turnover. These jobs do not provide the long term stability these
communities want.''
</P>
<P>
   Not so, Georgia officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The first guards hired by Cornell of Houston, Texas has been
completed and a second has started for guards who will work at the
750-bed medium-security Charlton prison near the Okefenokee.
</P>
<P>
   By mid August, the first group of 50 inmates will arrive at
Charlton, Georgia's first for adult inmates imprisoned by a
for-profit company.
</P>
<P>
   And possibly by the end of November, Memphis-based Corrections
Corp. of America will open the two private prisons in Coffee and
Wheeler counties, both also designed to hold 750 medium-security
Georgia inmates. Like Cornell, CCA plans to expand the prisons next
spring , adding ``speculative'' beds, to hold 1,600 inmates each,
hoping that Georgia or some other state with crushing prison
populations will be eager to pay the company to take care of their
criminals in the additional 2,550 beds .
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is final but we have been in discussions with Georgia
correctional officials'' about using all 1,600 beds in each prison,
said CCA Vice President Susan Hart.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell Executive Vice President Steven Logan said his company
has not yet talked to Georgia prison officials about using the
additional beds, but ``we feel comfortable'' that the state will
need the additional prison beds.
</P>
<P>
   Murdock said the two companies would house out-of-state inmates
in those additional cells if Georgia cannot use them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no reason for trepidation'' aboout the private
facilities, Murdock said. But he admits ``it should be at least a
year before we know if it's worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   And once the three prisons are completed, with a total of 1,600
prison beds each, they will be larger than any state-run prison.
</P>
<P>
   Department of Corrections Commissioner Wayne Garner believes the
savings will be significant.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia taxpayers will pay Cornell between $37.09 and $45.13 per
inmate per day, or almost $116.2 million over the next decade and
possibly another $101 million if the state uses the additional
beds.
</P>
<P>
   CCA, which signed two separate contracts after the Charlton
County agreement was sealed, will get more per inmates than
Cornell. The charge for inmates at both prisons will be between
$44.95 and $48.10 per inmate per day for 20 years, or more than
$363.500 million from the 20-year contract and another $556.6
million if the additional 750 prison beds are used.
</P>
<P>
   Correction officials calculate the average cost for each inmate
in a state prison is $54.14, which includes the cost of
construction and interest on the debt. That daily cost also is an
average that takes into account the high cost of the medical prison
and housing high security inmates in less-expensive institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Cornell and CCA are supposed to cover the cost of inmates'
medical expenses, clothing, food and education and substance abuse
programs under the private program.
</P>
<P>
   The prisons must supply a certain number of guards and they must
offer education and treatment programs and work every inmate eight
hours a day, five days a week, something the state has been unable
to do because there are not enough jobs for all the state's
prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Though Georgia has never had any private adult prisons, the
state has had some experience with privatizing its prisons for
juveniles and with the company that will operate the adult private
prison in Charlton County. Cornell was hired to run a 120-bed
facility in Pelham for juvenile girl, but Georgia canceled the
contract two months later because the Houston company could not
staff the facility at the level the state wanted at the price the
company was charging.
</P>
<P>
   DOC says state monitors - two former warden - will prevent such
problems.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies have encountered problems in other states
where Cornell runs 42 private private prisons and CCA operates 77.
</P>
<P>
   For example:
</P>
<P>
   Two sex offenders from Oregon incarcerated in Texas escaped from
the CCA Houston Processing Center which was built for undocumented
immigrants about to be deported. Texas authorities could not arrest
the fugitives, however, because at the time there was no state law
making it a crime to escape from a private prison.
</P>
<P>
   Such a dilemma is not unusual, Feaster said. ``Only 27 states
have private prisons and not all those states have legislation on
the books that covers everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia law allows local law enforcement to arrest any inmates
who escape from one of the private prisons in this state, however.
</P>
<P>
   Out of a CCA facility in Youngstown, Ohio, several months ago
came numerous reports of stabbings and excessive force and staff
charges of discrimination, harassment and poor working conditions.
It was only then that Youngstown learned that the inmates from
Washington, D.C. that were sent to the 2,000-bed medium-security
prison were much more dangerous than they were led to believe.
Also, CCA initially refused to let the local sheriff in the
facility to investigate the stabbings.

   Murdock said the state's agreement with both companies dictates
that state corrections and law enforcement officers can come inside
at any time, and both companies will be accountable to the state
and the communities where they are located.
</P>
<P>
   Feaster of the government employees union said that has not been
the case in other states and she questioned whether the three
private prisons in Georgia would be more open since they had not
started operating. She pointed out, however, that since both
companies are publicly-traded their first responsibilities are to
their stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   ``You must be aware these people are in for a profit,'' Feaster
said.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heat will build over the central and southern Plains as high
pressure at 20,000 feet expands over the region. The high pressure
aloft marks a region of unusual warmth at high levels which will
limit afternoon thunderstorms over much of the region. Afternoon
highs between 95 and 105 degrees will be common. But moisture from
a dissipating tropical disturbance will bring slow-moving downpours
to parts of central and western Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Potent thunderstorms will erupt across western parts of the
Northern Plains near a front separating the very hot air to the
south from somewhat cooler conditions over southern Canada.
</P>
<P>
   A volatile combination of a vigorous jet-stream disturbance and
increasing humidity will bring the risk of large thunderstorms with
damaging winds, hail, and a few tornadoes during the afternoon and
evening. The cluster of thunderstorms will drift into the upper
Mississippi Valley overnight.
</P>
<P>
   The Northeast will be partly to mostly sunny with comfortable
humidity as high pressure moves across New England. Active
afternoon sea breezes will keep coastal areas several degrees
cooler than the interior.
</P>
<P>
   Sultry weather will linger over the Southeast. Afternoon thunder
will occur near a front in the Carolinas and southern Appalachians.
While scattered thunderstorms will occur near the fire-plagued
areas of northern Florida, no persistent rain is expected.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the West will be warm with afternoon thunder
scattered through the Rockies and Southwest. Clouds will linger
much of the day near the Washington coast.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The First Bolts
</P>
<P>
   All lightning is dangerous, but the first strokes in a storm may
be the most powerful of all. Lightning results when a difference in
electric charge in the atmosphere overcomes the resistance of the
air. Most thunderstorms have positive charges near the top and
negative charges at the bottom. Strong high-level winds can cause
the thunderstorm to tilt, with the positive charges drifting to the
front of the storm. As a result, the first strokes tend to lower
positive charges to the ground. Measurement of electric currents
shows that these positive bolts can be twice as strong as negative
lightning.

BAKER'S GAMESMANSHIP, OREL WERE RIGHT ON TARGET 
</HEADLINE>
   By TIM KEOWN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intrigue and espionage hit the Giants-Dodgers rivalry Friday
night, as if it needed the boost. There was already a sellout crowd
and a January-in-Bismarck bite in the air. Longtime fan favorite
Orel Hershiser was ready to take the mound against his old team, so
why not throw in a healthy undercurrent of bad blood to thicken the
plot?
</P>
<P>
   Dusty Baker had inside information _ his ``Dodger sources'' he
said _ that Barry Bonds was going to be sent a message, most likely
in the form of a fastball to the ribs. The Dodgers were going to
retaliate against Bonds for his post-homer flamboyance (two
pirouettes, for those of you judging at home) in the memorable
series between the two teams last September.
</P>
<P>
   Baker's news traveled via reporters, from Baker to Bonds to
Dodgers manager Glenn Hoffman. It traveled in accordance with a law
of nature, like birds bringing food back to the nest. Bonds
expressed disdain with Baker, the Dodgers professed total ignorance
and Baker just smiled and shrugged.
</P>
<P>
   The motives will be misinterpreted in any number of convoluted
ways, but Baker's mission was accomplished. Frankly, the guess here
is he doesn't care much about Bonds' reaction, even if it did
include an invitation for Baker to kiss Bonds' rear. If this is a
``feud'' it's a one-way feud. Baker was unbothered by any of it.
</P>
<P>
   What the manager was doing was protecting his best player, and
he didn't arrive at his method of communication randomly. Granted,
this was out of character for him; he doesn't normally confide
sensitive information like that to a semicircle of reporters.
That's what made it seem as if he would break into a smile and let
loose with a hearty laugh at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   But think about what he accomplished: Whether his information
was correct or not, his pre-emptive strike _ delivered via reporter
_ let the Dodgers know he wouldn't take any of it. If Bonds didn't
understand the method, he can at least be thankful for it.
</P>
<P>
   After all, just because the freeway is closed doesn't mean you
can't get to where you want to go. Sometimes you have to use the
gravelly backroads of your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hershiser didn't disappoint anybody. In a
thoroughly professional manner, he crafted a game in the Catfish
Hunter style. He allowed a couple of solo homers but wisely grouped
them around a whole lot of outs. He weaved in and out of trouble,
never appearing to have complete control.
</P>
<P>
   Realistically, this is exactly the kind of pitcher he is right
now. He's 40 years old, and he survived seven innings on a
hypercharged _ and damned cold _ night. He even managed to get
through perhaps the worst at bat known to man, his sixth-inning
strikeout that consisted of two thrown bats sandwiched around an
awkward bunt attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't need to keep myself down before the game,'' he said.
``I haven't been on a winning streak, so all the energy I could get
I was willing to accept. If I felt anything extra, I wanted to keep
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of Hershiser's appeal is his refusal to buy into the party
line. He didn't pretend this was just another game, and he showed
that when he hugged J.T. Snow on the bench after Snow's three-run
homer in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't usually hug on the bench, but that was pretty big for
me,'' Hershiser said. ``I wouldn't have wanted to stand here
talking about a loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow's season is starting to take on a strong resemblance to the
one he put together last year. It starts chaotically. Tangential
events crowd the center of the stage. The batting average dips into
the land of the backup shortstop, and then ... presto, he becomes a
different guy.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Snow singled, hit a three-run homer and doubled.
The homer put the Giants up 4-2 and, perhaps more importantly,
allowed Hershiser to take a deep breath for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Orlando Cepeda stopped Snow in the clubhouse before the game and
remarked on the recent streak that has elevated Snow's average to
.235. Snow shrugged and said, more than once, that it's a matter of
him seeing the ball better than before.
</P>
<P>
   It might be a cliche, but that doesn't mean it isn't true.
Sometimes the simplest explanations just happen to be the best
ones.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's final at bat produced an off-field bloop double that
dropped in exactly one micron fair. What that ball fell in, no
further proof was needed: Snow is living right.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for the Giants as a whole. Except for a
couple of hold-your-breath injuries Friday night _ Bill Mueller and
Rich Aurilia _ they look ready to hold their ground until the
All-Star break comes and Jeff Kent returns.
</P>
<P>
   They might even be able to take the Dodgers completely out of
the picture, although Baker's response, especially in light of the
night's events, was telling: ``We're not looking behind us,'' he
said. ``We're looking ahead of us.''

     BALDWINS TO THROW BASH FOR CLINTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Alec Baldwin  &LR; and  &UR; Kim Basinger  &LR; are throwing a ``summer lawn
party'' fund-raiser for  &UR; Bill Clinton  &LR; at their home in the
Hamptons on August 1. Tickets will cost from $250 to $1,000 -- do
guests in the low-price range have to stand on crabgrass or
downwind from the barbecue? -- reports the Washington Post.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these plans, Baldwin, who said last year he had his eye
on a Senate race, told USA Today this week that nothing about
politics ``has any decency or honor anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   And Basinger seems less than enthusiastic about joining the
political fray. ``Up until now,'' she said in a recent interview,
``when we'd get into those long discussions about politics, I would
run to my bathroom, put on my favorite CD and turn it up as loud as
I could.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; FLASH &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - In London,  &UR; Madonna &LR; 's been shooting a rock video wherein she
walks out of Claridges Hotel and into a pack of paparazzi, in much
the manner of  &UR; Princess Diana &LR;  on the night she died.  &UR; Mohamed &LR; 
 &UR; Al Fayed &LR; , father of Di's late boyfriend,  &UR; Dodi &LR; , told The Mirror
that he thinks the hotel scenes are ``tasteless.''
</P>
<P>
   - The question ``What do spies eat?'' is answered fully (Chicken
and Ham Salad Veronique; Lemon Champagne Punch) in a new book,
``Spies, Black Ties &AMP; Mango Pieces: Stories and Recipes from CIA
Families All Over the World'' (Community Communications; $19.95).
 &UR; Karola Craib &LR;  is looking forward to the Ames Antipasti.
</P>
<P>
   - Petaluma artist  &UR; Pele de Lappe &LR;  was murky on the details, but
knew that her father had been married once before, to
screenwriter &UR; Frances Marion &LR; , before he married her mother.
Browsing in the bookstore at the Pacific Film Archive's just-over
film series on women screenwriters, de Lappe found ``Without Lying
Down _  &UR; Frances Marion &LR;  and the Powerful Women of Early
Hollywood,'' which included seven full pages on the marriage. The
detail that grabbed her most was the image of the couple, holding
hands on a San Francisco park bench, when the earthquake struck on
April 18, 1906.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;   &UR; GAME PLANS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - At the Marin County Fair over the weekend,  &UR; Richard O'Lone &LR; 
saw a woman riding the Ferris Wheel with two boys, all the while
speaking on a cellular phone.
</P>
<P>
   - You're sitting there at the breakfast table, and you haven't
said anything to your spouse or children since, ``Who has the
sports section?''  &UR; Gary Krane &LR; 's new book, ``Simple Fun for Busy
People'' (Conari; $12.95) purports to provide 333 free ways ``to
enjoy your loved ones more in the time you have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Undercover Penny,'' a game for two, employs one penny and
a bed. ``One person throws a penny under the covers. Both scramble
to find the penny, hopefully without bumping heads. The one who
finds the penny and picks it up wins.''
</P>
<P>
   A few caveats: ``Be sure not to have any furniture, sharp or
hard objects, or fragile items near the bed that you could possibly
hit with your head or foot. Be sure to keep your head far enough
away from the other person's knees and feat. Or to be 99 percent
safe, wear a helmet with a face guard.'' Furthermore, ``Be sure you
don't have a bad back or any other serious bone, muscular or
internal problem. ... Shower beforehand.''
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps you'd rather play ``Office Kidnapping'': ``Hide an
office item belonging to a co-worker, such as a stapler, and leave
an obvious ransom note.'' Here again, a helmet might be required.
</P>
<P>
   - Pursuant to tips that appeared recently for extricating
oneself from conversation, No Flak Press has forwarded one of its
``Get Out of Conversation Free'' cards, entitling the bearer to
abruptly terminate ``any conversation you find degrading,
embarrassing, tiresome, pointless or just plain boring. No apology
or explanation necessary.'' No Flak, which is at 6114 LaSalle
Avenue, Oakland 94611, is selling these for $2.

   &UR; ``Have you crossed the `ma'am' threshold yet? ... Trouble &LR;

 &UR; insect. `Woman' reduces us to gender only. ... Perhaps we &LR; 
 &UR; should go back to the elegant `Madam,' as in Madam President. &LR;

 Silicon Valley Trade Group to Help Out With Commute Woes   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Here's a liberating thought for this holiday weekend. The Silicon
Valley Manufacturing Group is doing a survey that eventually could
help ease traffic in the South Bay.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The SVMG is trying to find out where people who work in Santa
Clara County live. To get this data without snooping, the group has
asked its 130 member firms to provide it with the home ZIP codes of
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The SVMG expects to compile this ZIP code info by the end of
July and turn it over to the Valley Transportation Authority, which
sets mass transit policy for Santa Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   The Transportation Authority will create two maps: one showing
where workers live, and the other displaying mass transit routes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to see if there are huge commute corridors that are
unserved by mass transit, and if so, whether we can make changes,''
said Leslee Coleman, vice president of the Manufacturing Group.
</P>
<P>
   The accuracy of the survey will depend on getting as much ZIP
code data as possible.
</P>
<P>
   SVMG's member firms _ which include Intel, National
Semiconductor and Sun Microsystems _ employ 250,000 people or about
one-third of the private-sector workforce in Santa Clara County,
Coleman said.
</P>
<P>
   About half of the members have already supplied their employees'
ZIPs.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Santa Clara County employers who  &LR; aren't &LR;  part of the
Manufacturing Group can still take part in the survey by visiting
the Web site ( &LR; www.svmg.org &LR; ). Click on the line that says:
``Commute Service Survey Plan.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Food for thought: &LR;  Americans take freedom for granted. But on
this day of barbecues and fireworks, take a minute to think about
those who brave imprisonment or death for their beliefs. All you
have to do is visit the Amnesty International Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Amnesty site,  &LR; rights.amnesty.org &LR; , was just named one of
the 50 best pages on the Web by CIO Magazine, a trade publication
aimed at the people who run corporate information systems.
</P>
<P>
   The site was created in part by Icon Medialab and Circumstance,
two Web design firms in San Francisco, with assistance from the
Digital Artists and Writer's Group in Mill Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Mother lode? &LR;  Last month I wrote about venture capitalist
George Zachary, who flew to Sweden to advise that country on how to
rev up its economy, lest its young flee for greener pastures.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, I heard from Swedes who've already followed the lure
of high-tech riches to the Bay Area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a new gold rush,'' said Svante Rodegard, a Swedish
emigre in San Francisco. ``This time it's not gold in the streets
that draws us, but the lure of IPOs in Silicon Valley.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact there are so many Swedes on the local high-tech scene
that they've formed a group, the Silicon Vikings, which gets
together monthly. (For details e-mail  &LR; hlindh &LR; lwi.xerox.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Rodegard said Swedes back home enjoy a great standard of living.
Even so, many of them are caught up in the ``romantic dream'' of
instant riches that seems to pervade news coverage of the American
economy.
</P>
<P>
   As evidence of Sweden's wanderlust, Rodegard cites the
popularity of a rock musical produced by members of the pop group
Abba. The musical tells of the time between 1880 and 1920 when a
quarter of the Swedish population went abroad _ many to America _
to escape starvation and religious feuds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This show has been sold out for over three years, as I see it
because of (this) romantic idea and view of America,'' Rodegard
said.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Laughing matter: &LR;  Stand-up comic Dan St. Paul knows how people
can tell if their high-tech friends used to be cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Clue number one: ``When you say `Draw!' he pulls out his Palm
Pilot.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Paul will be gunning for laughs when he performs as the
warm-up act for country singer Vince Gill at the Mountain Winery in
Saratoga next Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Math 101: &LR;  Steven Kishi, marketing manager at Extensity,
recently gave me this business plan tip. Extensity is an Emeryville
startup that sells programs for controlling business expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The magic numbers for a startup are one, eight, 15, 30,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Put a dollar sign in front of each number, and six zeroes
behind, and those are the figures an investor wants to see in a
startup's revenue projection for its first four years.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Whodunit? &LR;  Walt Shugert routinely downloads closing stock
prices using a portfolio-tracking service on Excite. So he was
momentarily stunned when an unexplained glitch erroneously showed
that his AT&AMP;T shares plunged 99 percent _ overnight!
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``That was a one-time aberration,'' Shugert said. ``But
imagine (if some) old geezer with a bad heart saw that. Someone
could write a murder mystery ...`I found gramps slumped over his
computer, clutching his mouse.'''
</P>
<P>
   Excite spokeswoman Melissa Walia said she's never received
any &UR;  &LR; complaints about the stock-tracking service. (Of course dead
geezers tell no tales!)

DOCTOR QUITS VIAGRA-SELLING WEB SITE AS REGULATORS CLOSE IN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Colorado doctor said Thursday that he has
resigned as medical director of a controversial Web site that sells
Viagra and other drugs without prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The physician, Dr. Benjamin T. Johnson, said the furor over the
Internet sales of Viagra _ the wildly popular new impotence drug _
``could cost me my career.''
</P>
<P>
   An article in Thursday's Chronicle raised ethical and legal
questions about the Web site, which is operated by a company called
Performance Drugs Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, noting that regulators are scrutinizing the Web site,
said that it ``will probably not be open'' anymore as of Friday.
The site appeared to still be operating Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   He said he agreed to get involved in the Web site after being
advised that there was nothing illegal about the online pharmacy's
operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going under some initial legal advice about the
statutes regarding telemedicine and the fact that there have been a
number of sites practicing medicine over the Internet for over a
year now,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was our understanding that there was nothing illegal about
this practice. Before putting significant thought into it, I felt
like issuing Viagra this way was not that big of a deal. But
obviously the majority of physicians think it was significant.''
</P>
<P>
   Regulators in California and Denver, responding in part to
questions raised by The Chronicle article, said they are exchanging
information and gathering documents about Internet drug dispensing.
</P>
<P>
   At least two sites are being examined, according to a
spokeswoman at the California Medical Board in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's report about easy access to Viagra comes against
a background of increasing concern about the potential dangers of
the popular impotence pill manufactured by Pfizer Inc.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, D.C., noted consumer advocate Sidney Wolfe
accused Pfizer and the Food and Drug Administration of downplaying
the drug's side effects. He issued a report this week about
potentially deadly interactions between Viagra and other medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huge numbers of people are taking this drug who should not be
taking it,'' Wolfe said Thursday. ``Whether Pfizer is responsible
directly or not, if they are aware of illicit traffic they should
do something about it. It's not that difficult to figure out where
it's coming from.''
</P>
<P>
   Responding to questions raised by The Chronicle, a Pfizer
spokeswoman said the company already has been ``closely
monitoring'' the Internet along with other venues where people may
be selling Viagra without adequate physician oversight.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials defended their decision to allow sales of the
drug, saying that precautions are already in place. Questions about
specific prescribing practices generally fall outside the FDA's
purview, a spokeswoman said, although the agency attempts to track
improper drug claims on the Internet and in other media.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's story disclosed how a Chronicle reporter was able to
easily obtain 10 tablets of Viagra, plus 10 doses of a purported
``female erectile cream'' containing a prescription asthma drug,
through the mail by filling out a brief form on the Performance
Drugs Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The address of the Web site is performancedrugs.com.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, the site contained a new advisory indicating that all
customers would be contacted by a physician before orders are
filled. The site's online ``medical history'' questionnaire already
had been revamped, with several additional questions added, since
The Chronicle placed its order two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left at Performance Drugs' Seattle call center were not
returned Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reach Johnson, who had signed The Chronicle's drug
prescription order, were unsuccessful until after the story
appeared.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson finally came to the phone Thursday, describing a career
in a virtual shambles as lawyers and other physicians heaped
condemnations on him.
</P>
<P>
   He said he quit a few days after the reporter's order was
processed because he started to suspect that his role in the Web
project had been a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said there are ``probably at least 20 sites'' on the
Internet offering essentially the same service as those provided by
Performance Drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, physicians renewed their warnings against taking
Viagra without a doctor's advice. Dr. Charlotte Yeh, physician in
chief of the emergency department at New England Medical Center in
Boston, said emergency rooms are running a major new risk of
administering nitrate drugs to heart-attack patients taking Viagra.
</P>
<P>
   The nitrates are known to interact with Viagra in a way that can
lead to fatal reductions in blood pressure. Yeh endorsed a new call
by the nonprofit organization Medicalert to issue special medical
tags for Viagra takers so that doctors can avoid giving
nitroglycerine.
</P>
<P>
   In a related development, Johnson said another doctor who had
been running a clinic in San Francisco that Johnson owns quit in
response to Thursday's article.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left on the answering machine of the San Francisco
clinic, called the Body Enhancement Center, were not returned
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson declined to identify the doctor, and he said the San
Francisco operation was not connected to the controversy over the
Performance Drugs Web site.

ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS CREATES NEW AIDS CRISIS 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    GENEVA _ Adding to the desperate poverty and political
disruption that are helping spread the AIDS virus across southern
Africa, the new economic crisis gripping the nations of Southeast
Asia has begun to intensify the epidemic there, delegates from
Third World countries say bitterly.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The widely proclaimed theme of the 12th World AIDS Conference in
Geneva this week has been ``Bridging the Gap,'' and nothing
illustrates the width and depth of that gap more starkly than the
billion-dollar _ and rising _ AIDS budget of the United States
compared with the steadily declining funds to battle the epidemic
in Africa and Asia _ where 95 percent of the world's people with
AIDS or HIV infection now live.
</P>
<P>
   Third World delegates said combinations of economic downturns in
many of thir nations and what they termed ``donor fatigue'' by
wealthy countries and agencies, including international foundations
and the World Bank, are making less and less money available for
AIDS prevention programs and treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The powerful triple combination therapies that include the new
protease inhibitors are out of reach for all but the upper classes.
Even the older and cheaper drugs like AZT and ddI are rarely
available for poor people.
</P>
<P>
   Rubarima Ruranga, for example, a major in the Ugandan army who
has lived with HIV for 14 years, is a vigorous AIDS activist. He is
grateful that UNAIDS, the United Nations agency, has provided funds
for anti-HIV drugs and has worked out agreements with several major
international pharmaceutical firms to lower their drug prices.
</P>
<P>
   But Uganda, with a population of 20 million and a public health
budget that comes out to about $8 per person per year, certainly
cannot afford the cost of treating all its 1.8 million HIV-infected
people, even though the country has one of Africa's most effective
AIDS prevention programs, Ruranga said.
</P>
<P>
   Southeast Asia may be in just as much trouble, according to
Marina Mahathir, the British-educated director of the Malaysian
AIDS Council.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many countries in my region are now facing a situation where
millions are unemployed, barely able to scrape together enough to
buy food and daily necessities,'' she said. ``And if we superimpose
HIV/AIDS onto this scenario, the picture looks very gloomy
indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   According to UNAIDS estimates, at least half of the 60 to 70
million adults who will be infected with the AIDS virus will come
from South and Southeast Asia, Mahathir said. ``And that was in the
`good times,''' she added, ``The reasons for these high numbers are
plentiful: ignorance and denial in some countries, political
instability in others, a relative lack of funds in still others.''
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir herself is not without political power because her
father, Dr. Mahathir Mohammad, is not only a noted physician but
the prime minister of Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   ``But that makes no difference,'' she said, ``because our
organization, the only AIDS-activist one in the country, must deal
with the Ministry of Health and the ministry's AIDS programs _
including prevention programs _ which are being cut like everything
else, leaving people even more vulnerable to AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sad irony of this situation,'' Mahathir told conference
delegates, ``is that even when the countries of Asia recover from
the economic crisis in the future, as we pray they will, the impact
of the crisis-boosted AIDS pandemic will act as a barrier to full
economic recovery. As prevention programs are cut now, there will
be more people infected who will require expensive care and
treatment in the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where and how can they expect to get this in the coming years?
How do we predict the future social costs of AIDS, the numbers of
orphans and other survivors to care for, the depletion of human
resources required to rebuild our countries?''
</P>
<P>
   This international AIDS conference, with its news of fresh
scientific knowledge amid continuing gloomy disease statistics,
with its promising results of new drug therapies and its distant
hopes for future vaccines, will end in final progress reports and
ceremonies Friday.

A's Light Fireworks on Padres  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ That much-anticipated fireworks show at the
Coliseum got off to a quick start last night, courtesy of San Diego
pitcher Sterling Hitchcock. The Padres left-hander, only one outing
removed from his no-hit bid, dished up a sixth-inning, belt-high
fastball that was so enticing, it would have been absolutely
criminal not to knock the stuffing out of it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And justice would have it that a guy in the throes of a hitting
slump, A's shortstop Miguel Tejada, would do the honors. With two
out and runners on first and second, Tejada put the brakes on his
2-for-21 skid and crushed Hitchcock's mistake over the outfield
wall in right for his second home run of the year. Coliseum
officials sent a few rockets into the foggy evening to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   But the home team was not done yet.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Mitchell drove in a run and scored another in the seventh,
and the A's won the three-game interleague series with an
impressive 7-2 victory that juiced up the packed house of 40,374,
the second-largest crowd at the Coliseum this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good pitch,'' said Tejada, who last homered June 15.
``It felt good to hit one like that.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty to cheer _ the A's finally won on a scheduled
fireworks night (the first time since 1996), and A's left-hander
Kenny Rogers pitched his second complete game to raise his record
to 8-3.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could feel it in our dugout, the way Kenny was throwing the
ball, that the game was over at that point,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers would not go that far. ``I never feel like the game is
over; I've been humbled too many times to feel that way,'' he said,
``but I had an idea how I wanted to go after each hitter, got some
double-play balls when I needed them at the right time.
</P>
<P>
   ``And when I got some room to breathe, yeah, it was real nice.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the kind of ball the A's have been promising all along,
the timely two-out hits, solid defense and efficient pitching that
front-runners such as the Padres regularly employ.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like I've said, when we put things together, we can play with
anybody,'' Howe said.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, the A's took their cue from San Diego. They
pounded out 30 hits in the series, 10 Thursday night, and gave
themselves a nice boost heading into a tough series at Anaheim, the
final three games before the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   How's this for timing _ the A's have dropped 14 of their past 15
games against the Angels. Now they are on a roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any series (win) is a big lift for us, at this point,'' said
third baseman Mike Blowers, who was 2-for-4 with a pair of singles
and scored off Tejada's three-run blast. ``When you play a club
that's young and down in the standings, a lot of guys get pretty
fired up to play a series like this. I think that was the case for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   San Diego jumped to a 2-0 lead in the second when catcher Jim
Leyritz hit Roger's first-pitch fastball over the wall in center
field.
</P>
<P>
   But Rickey Henderson put the A's on the board in the bottom of
the inning, driving in his 36th run and stealing his 36th base.
Catcher A.J. Hinch hit a two-out single and scrambled to second on
a wild pitch, and Henderson lifted his RBI line-drive single over
the head of shortstop Chris Gomez. He went on to swipe second.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Stairs' seventh-inning line drive single drove in Mitchell,
and he celebrated by making an appearance at first base in the
ninth inning. It was the first time Stairs played first base since
he injured his left shoulder April 21 in a collision with the
Twins' Paul Molitor.

Snow Blasts Angels  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Interleague play is over, but the Giants plan
to hide this information from first baseman J.T. Snow. They will
tell him that those guys visiting 3Com Park tonight in the ``LA''
caps are from another league. Why not? Events of the past several
weeks suggest they are from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   Snow claimed the title of Interleague King last season when he
hit .379 with 20 RBIs and a majors-best 10 homers in 16 games, and
he fairly defended it this year by hitting .366 with five homers
and 14 RBIs in 13 interleague games.
</P>
<P>
   He finished the 1998 AL-NL series loudly last night with two
homers, a double and four RBIs in the Giants' 7-4 victory over the
Anaheim Angels, their fourth win in six games, which moved them
within 41/2 games of first-place San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Snow now has 42 RBIs, third-best on the team behind Barry Bonds
(59), who missed the game with an illness, and Jeff Kent (49), who
has not played since June 9.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels traded Snow to the Giants two winters ago, and he has
punished them in interleague play ever since.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt good. I won't lie about that. Anytime you play well
when you're going up against your former team you want to do well.
I'm no different,'' said Snow, who has been asked a gazillion times
why he does so well against the American League. His answer is
always the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coincidence, I guess. I can't explain it.''
</P>
<P>
   Snow's desire to throttle the Angels grew in the seventh inning
when they finally retired him on a line drive to right. During the
at-bat, pitcher Pep Harris was shaking off a lot of signs, and Snow
stepped out of the box a few times. Angels coach Larry Bowa started
hollering at Snow to get back in, and that ticked him off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was coming from the area where the coaches stand. I didn't
think it was very professional, especially coming from a coach,''
Snow said.
</P>
<P>
   It was already a 7-1 game by then. Snow had hit a two-run homer
in a three-run first inning, an RBI double in the third and another
homer leading off the sixth, all off starter Jason Dickson.
</P>
<P>
   Snow's hitting helped the Giants finish their interleague
schedule at 8-5 _ they were 10-6 last year _ and now they train
their guns on the Los Angeles Dodgers, who are 6-4 under new
manager Glenn Hoffman after a sweep of the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants won their 50th game of the season without Kent or
Bonds, who was down with a bout of gastroenteritis, perhaps brought
on by a bad piece of chicken from the night before. He was
dehydrated and had to take intravenous fluids at a nearby hospital.
</P>
<P>
   But manager Dusty Baker had a hot hitter to replace Bonds in the
third spot. Stan Javier brought a six-game hitting streak and a
.537 average over his last 13 games into the contest, and he
quickly fattened the numbers further.
</P>
<P>
   After Dickson walked Bill Mueller with one out in the first
inning, Javier smashed a run-scoring double to the wall in
right-center. Charlie Hayes grounded out, but Snow then hit a
two-run homer. Javier had two of the Giants' 10 hits, as did Rey
Sanchez, who had a two-run single in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   All that offense helped Kirk Rueter (10-3) become the league's
fifth 10-game winner. Rueter was in damage-control mode all night
as he allowed nine hits. But the Angels mustered just one run in
his 51/3 innings, Darin Erstad's homer leading off the first
inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter seemed inclined to give the whole 3-0 lead back right
there when he allowed singles to Dave Hollins and Jim Edmonds after
the home run. Baker then emerged for a very long chat with his
pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like a 20-second timeout, just to take the wind out of
the ball,'' Baker said. ``Most of the time things happen real
quickly. I just wanted a break in the action to let him get his
composure.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker's timeout did the trick. Tim Salmon flied out, Cecil
Fielder struck out on an inside fastball at the knees, and Garret
Anderson popped out to short left.
</P>
<P>
   Baker finally removed Rueter amid another Angels rally in the
sixth, and Julian Tavarez came to the rescue by getting an
inning-ending double-play ball from hot-hitting rookie Justin
Baughman.
</P>
<P>
   A three-run Hollins homer off Rich Rodriguez in the ninth made
the score closer than the game really was.

   Grass Is Greener on Novotna's Side 
 
 By BRUCE JENKINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Jana Novotna can't lose it now. Absolutely
out of the question. The loud, lingering applause of Centre Court
Thursday told Novotna that the tournament is hers.
</P>
<P>
   There is no one left in her way, unless you count Nathalie
Tauziat, and only Tauziat is counting. These are two fine
grass-court players, but Tauziat's game is 1965 to Novotna's
cutting edge.
</P>
<P>
   Just as importantly, it appears that nerves are no longer an
issue.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Tauziat is a steely, hardened competitor. She took
the unpopular route in her native France by severing ties with the
national federation, she humbled world No.2 Lindsay Davenport in
the quarterfinals here, and she shook off a terrible first set
Thursday to beat Natasha Zvereva 1-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   But Novotna, on the eve of Saturday's final, is suddenly
everyone's darling. That would include her friend and doubles
partner, No.1 seed Martina Hingis, who managed many smiles after
losing to Novotna 6-4, 6-4. ``Jana deserves this,'' said Hingis.
``She's just the better player. She's a great champion.''
</P>
<P>
   In truth, Novotna is not a champion of anything. Just months
from her 30th birthday, she never has won a Grand Slam.
</P>
<P>
   But to everyone around the All England Club Thursday, Novotna
had the champion's look. She has reached the finals twice before _
the horrendous collapse against Steffi Graf in '93 and a three-set
loss to Hingis last year. Saturday, there can be no choking.
</P>
<P>
   And if there is . . . one shudders at the prospect. A loss
tomorrow and Novotna makes the Buffalo Bills look like
Montana-to-Rice.
</P>
<P>
   The day began with Zvereva in a zone, the same one that carried
her so effortlessly through the draw, and she made child's play of
the first set.
</P>
<P>
   After the laser-beam rockets of Steffi Graf and Monica Seles,
Tauziat's shots must have looked like moonballs to Zvereva. Tauziat
stumbled and shrieked and looked so outclassed, you wondered why
they didn't call the whole thing off.
</P>
<P>
   But Tauziat has spent a lifetime fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   She was born and spent some of her formative years in Africa,
honing her strokes in a highly unlikely setting. When she moved to
France and chose a controversial, outspoken coach, Regis de
Camaret, she lost the support of the French federation.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he speaks, he says what he thinks, and sometimes it's not
nice to listen to,'' Tauziat said. ``With that I was put out of the
(system). For many years I have played for myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva is no stranger to rebellion, having pioneered the
Russian players' fight to keep their prize money in the late '80s
and early '90s, but this was an unfamiliar stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been in this situation before,'' she said. ``I
think about people like Steffi and Monica doing it over and over,
just incredible, and for me just once was really draining. I'm so
tired. I think I need a mental institution break (laughter).''
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva might have the best hands in women's tennis, as Seles
said before the tournament, but the legs are a different story. She
looked frustrated and weary as the relentless Tauziat kept the
pressure on. In a tough eighth game of the second set, Tauziat
fought off two break points to take a 5-3 lead.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum seemed clearly reversed at that point, and with
Zvereva netting a series of easy forehands in the tiebreaker, the
match seemed anything but even. In fact, the third set was strictly
a formality.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, I'm not on the moon already,'' said Tauziat, who lay
flat on her back, then pounded the grass ecstatically when the
match was over. ``But almost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tauziat-Zvereva match looked like something out of a
30-year-old tennis film, maybe Rosie Casals vs. Francoise Durr (the
great French player who, despite the federation squabbles, watched
with great interest from the Friends Box Thursday).
</P>
<P>
   Then came Hingis-Novotna, the ultimate fast-forward: Hingis,
with her cerebral, change-of-pace game against Novotna, looking so
much like Martina Navratilova with her spectacular athleticism and
all-court game.
</P>
<P>
   The quality of play was invigorating, a taste of big-time tennis
after nearly two weeks of tedium. Although Hingis made one candid
admission _ ``I'm not the player I was last year'' in terms of
conditioning _ she had no answers to Novotna's ingenuity. ``I hit
so many shots that, against other players, I win the point,'' said
Hingis. ``But Jana always gets it. I have to keep coming back,
again and again. I take this as it is: She was the better player.''
</P>
<P>
   For everyone who watched or attended the 1993 Wimbledon, there's
the indelible memory of Novotna blowing a 4-1 lead in the third set
of the final against Graf. She got a little misty at the consoling
words of the Duchess of Kent, then completely broke down in a
torrent of tears. So the question was inevitable: If she wins this
year, what will she say to the duchess?
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, right,'' she scoffed. ``Like I know what I'm going to
say to her already. I just finish an hour ago and I know already
what I'm going to say to the duchess, right? That's really good.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say anything,'' said Novotna, smiling now.
``I mean, she will be the one who talks to me. So I will just
reply, let's hope.''
</P>
<P>
   It has come to that at the '98 Wimbledon _ an unfettered
sentiment for Jana Novotna. It's her time and nobody else's. Let
her pass this test and forever be a champion.

 Funds Stagnant in 2nd Quarter   By Arthur M. Louis  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
U.S. equity mutual funds went nowhere during the second quarter.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The 2,068 domestic stock funds surveyed by Morningstar Inc.
suffered a 0.29 percent decline on average, lagging the overall
stock market by a substantial margin.
</P>
<P>
   While the funds were heading south, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500
index _ the market bellwether _ continued its upward march. It rose
3.3 percent (including reinvestment of dividends) during the
quarter, for its 14th consecutive quarterly gain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough second quarter, but it's still a good year,''
said Morningstar President Don Phillips.
</P>
<P>
   For the first six months of 1998, stock funds rose an average of
11.7 percent, compared with a 17.7 percent gain in the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   The 772 international stock funds surveyed by Morningstar did
worse than the domestic funds, skidding an average of 5.5 percent
last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   They were dragged down by huge declines, averaging around 20
percent, in the Asian and Emerging Markets funds.
</P>
<P>
   On the international scene, the only bright spot was Europe,
which has been undergoing a dramatic economic recovery. The 61
funds specializing in European stocks rose an average of 4.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The 371 specialty funds _ those that invest in only one industry
_ did poorly, declining an average of 1.7 percent. Natural-resource
funds were pounded the hardest, suffering a 9.8 percent decline.
</P>
<P>
   Only 19 percent of the funds surveyed by Morningstar beat the
S&AMP;P last quarter. That proportion, give or take a few percentage
points, has remained stable for more than four years.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, many investors have abandoned managed funds and
shifted to index funds, which are designed to track the performance
of various market averages.
</P>
<P>
   The second-largest fund of all, with $60.8 billion in assets, is
the Vanguard Index 500 Fund. Like the S&AMP;P 500, it enjoyed a 3.3
percent gain last quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The only larger fund _ Fidelity Magellan, with $74.6 billion in
assets _ performed slightly better than the Vanguard Index 500 last
quarter, gaining 3.4 percent. Despite its unwieldy size, it has
performed well lately under current manager Robert Stansky, who
took over in 1996 after a disappointing performance by predecessor
Jeffrey Vinik.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity Magellan still has some catching up to do. Its average
annual return during the past three years has been a 22.1 percent
gain _ well behind the 30.2 percent annual gain in the S&AMP;P.
</P>
<P>
   Fund expert Kurt Brouwer, of Brouwer &AMP; Janachowski in Tiburon,
insists that investors should still give managed funds a chance.
</P>
<P>
   Although the high-capitalization growth stocks that make up the
S&AMP;P 500 have been the market's darlings for the past several years,
that trend could change overnight, Brouwer warns. Many of those
stocks are way overvalued, he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have Coca-Cola selling at 50 times earnings and a lot of
other S&AMP;P stocks selling for 40 to 50 times earnings,'' Brouwer
observes. ``The companies aren't worth that, yet they keep going up
because everyone likes them and the bandwagon effect is very
strong. If I were making a long-term bet, I would focus on solid
companies that are not so well-recognized.''
</P>
<P>
   The best-performing fund last quarter was IAI Value Fund _
relatively tiny, with only $30 million in assets _ which rose a
phenomenal 24.8 percent. It invests in both large and small
companies that it considers undervalued _ particularly those that
recently have made promising changes in management or strategy.
</P>
<P>
   The gain was due entirely to the fact that one of its larger
holdings _ privately held telecommunications supplier Pathnet Inc.
_ has announced plans to go public. The fund had been valuing its
Pathnet holdings at cost, but the IPO added 28 percent to the
fund's value in a single day.
</P>
<P>
   Janus Twenty Fund, with $8.1 billion in assets, was the
next-best performer, with a 14.5 percent gain last quarter. It
holds a lot of popular high-cap growth stocks, a Janus spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Among its largest holdings are such spectacular performers as
Dell Computer, Pfizer, Microsoft and America Online.
</P>
<P>
   The worst-performing fund by far was the Lexington Troika Dialog
Russia Fund, which invests only in Russian stocks. It tumbled 55
percent last quarter. That performance mirrors the overall decline
in the Russian stock market.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Russian stock market last year was the
strongest in the world, rising more than 160 percent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Lawrence Kantor, managing director of New Jersey-based
Lexington Management, which operates the fund jointly with Russia's
Troika Dialog brokerage firm, said the calamitous turnaround was
caused largely by a slump in the world crude-oil market. The
Russian economy depends heavily on oil sales.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Russian companies have been under-paying taxes they
owe the Russian government, Kantor says, and this could damage the
economy by drying up the nation's currency reserves. Unlike the
United States, Russia is not considered creditworthy enough to
raise substantial new capital in international markets.
</P>
<P>
   Just yesterday, the Russian government threatened to seize the
assets of Gazprom, a gas producer and one of the country's largest
companies, to recover unpaid taxes. Gazprom promptly agreed to pay
the government $700 million a month in back taxes starting this
month.
</P>
<P>
   Gazprom is one of the largest Lexington Troika Dialog holdings.

 Some State Courts OK Online Traffic Schools   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Welcome to the new traffic school: no bad comics, no bloody-asphalt
videos, no teenage speed demons in the next seat.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now traffic offenders can clean up their driving records by
logging onto the Web from a personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   Despite objections from the California Department of Motor
Vehicles, a handful of California courts are allowing violators do
penance online rather than in a classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``It saved me a whole mess of time,'' said Sandy Serna, 54, a
Pacifica resident who completed an Internet course in two hours
versus six to eight hours in traditional traffic school.
</P>
<P>
   The DMV says online programs are ripe for fraud and abuse,
because it is difficult to verify who is sitting at the computer.
So the DMV has not given its stamp of approval to any online
traffic courses.
</P>
<P>
   To have a ticket erased from a driving record, a violator
usually must attend a DMV-sanctioned traffic school. But some
counties also recognize non-DMV approved schools, including online
ones.
</P>
<P>
   So far, San Mateo and Solano are the only Bay Area counties that
let drivers who get tickets in their counties go to virtual traffic
school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt it was a service to the public,'' said Peggy Thompson,
executive officer for Superior Court in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It simplifies life,'' Thompson said. ``In today's world, we're
all kind of running behind the time clock. With this you can do it
from your home and do it on your own clock.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Municipal Court was the first in the nation to
approve an online traffic course, in March last year. Since then,
18,000 students have graduated from the Los Angeles-based On-Line
Traffic School ( &LR; www.onlinetraffic.com &LR; ).
</P>
<P>
   Cyberclasses arrived in the Bay Area in December, when San Mateo
approved a course offered by Santa Rosa's TrafficSchoolOnline
( &LR; www.trafficschoolonline.com &LR; ). More than 3,500 students have
completed the course.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Since then, a few other online traffic schools have popped up,
all hoping to grab a niche in the lucrative traffic school
industry.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 950,000 Californians attend traffic school annually,
most of them paying between $20 and $45. Assuming an average cost
of about $30 per class, that adds up to a $28.5 million industry.
</P>
<P>
   In a sample of online traffic schools, tuitions were $20, $21
and $34. The schools can charge less than sit-down classes partly
because they require fewer employees.
</P>
<P>
   Adrienne Fong, a Hayward resident, said price was part of her
motivation in choosing an online program over a traditional course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `Wow, I don't even have to go somewhere _ plus
it's cheaper,''' said Fong, 31, a biochemical technician at
Genentech in South San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although online traffic schools claim that their lessons take
six to eight hours to complete, many participants, including this
reporter, finished in less than two hours.
</P>
<P>
   Most programs require students to read information about driving
rules, then answer some true/false and multiple-choice questions.
Students can keep retaking the test until they pass _ at which
time, the site sends the court a certificate certifying that you
passed.
</P>
<P>
   Critics worry that students will skim the material without
absorbing as much as they would in an eight-hour lecture.
</P>
<P>
   TrafficSchoolOnline founder Steve Soldis said he is improving
the program to check whether students are cruising through it too
fast.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, he said, ``We try to tell the courts that time
shouldn't be the issue. Of course, it's not going to take as long
as a sit-in class, but people are still learning from it.''
</P>
<P>
   His site prevents students from clicking the ``back'' button
during the exam _ which would let them look at the previous
material.
</P>
<P>
   But the DMV's biggest concern is that students might hire other
people to take the online exams for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we licensed it and approved it, I know exactly what would
happen _ college students would do the program for a fee,'' said
Tom Novi, chief of the Occupational Licensing branch of the DMV in
Sacramento. ``You'd have a cottage industry springing up.''
</P>
<P>
   That is one reason why Santa Clara County will not approve the
program, said Susan Myers, chief assistant executive officer for
the consolidated courts of Santa Clara County.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the Department of Motor Vehicles isn't prepared to
recognize online traffic school, then the court has problems going
that far,'' Myers said.
</P>
<P>
   But Lisa Riches, 31, founder of On-Line Traffic School, said
there is probably just as much fraud in regular traffic school as
in cyberspace.
</P>
<P>
   ``Traffic school is not foolproof either,'' she said. ``People
use fake IDs. And even if they do show up, they sleep through
class.''
</P>
<P>
   Students are also required to pass a test to graduate from
old-fashioned traffic school.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some are still not convinced by the idea of spending
free time in front of the computer. San Francisco resident John
Kurtz recently chose regular traffic school over the online option.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have to be in prison for a day, I'd rather go into a
class where maybe the guy would be funny,'' he said.

 Wall Street is hot for Rambus' chip technology   By Dan Fost  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Pay no attention to the soaring stock price of Rambus Inc., which
has shot up 54 percent in the past two weeks.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Geoff Tate, the president and chief executive of Mountain
View-based Rambus, shrugs off the rise as Wall Street's odd
response to ``old news.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to ignore the stock price when it goes up or down,''
said Tate, 43. ``When our stock price goes up, I am quick to remind
everybody here, `This is great, but don't think this means we got
smarter today. We're the same people we were before.'''
</P>
<P>
   Rambus is an anomaly in many ways. In a chip industry that's
hitting a rocky spell, Rambus is on a roll. Rambus doesn't even
make anything; it licenses its technology to chipmakers, and
encourages computer makers to use chips made with Rambus
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a stock market that rewards companies for short-term
earnings, Rambus keeps its eye on the horizon. Yet unlike other
companies whose stocks levitate on promises of future profits _
firms like Yahoo and Amazon.com spring to mind _ Rambus operates in
the black, and has ever since its initial public offering last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It should become one of the most profitable semiconductor
companies ever,'' said Mark Edelstone, an analyst with Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter in San Francisco. ``Its stock will probably hit
$150 in five years.''
</P>
<P>
   Rambus was founded in 1990 by P.Michael Farmwald, a former chief
scientist at chipmaker MIPS Technologies, and Mark Horowitz, an
engineering professor at Stanford University.
</P>
<P>
   They recognized a bottleneck that was slowing down the
processing power of computers and video games.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like Intel made microprocessors run faster and faster,
but computers and game consoles couldn't take full advantage of
that speed because memory chips had not advanced at the same rate.
The system could only move as fast as the weakest link in the
chain.
</P>
<P>
   Farmwald and Horowitz, who remain on Rambus's board of
directors, came up with a way to speed up the memory chips, and
they persuaded venture capitalists to invest $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   That was a start, but if Rambus was going to build these faster
memory chips, it would need a fabrication facility, and that would
cost a whopping $1billion.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than contract with another foundry to build the chips,
Rambus chose what Tate calls a software model: It would license its
intellectual property to chipmakers, and collect a royalty every
time they sold a chip with Rambus technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``A small royalty on billions of dollars can mean big dollars to
a small business like us,'' Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: Even with the market for dynamic random access
memory chips _ known as DRAM _ in a prolonged slump because of an
oversupply, it's still a huge market. Tate said it has grown from
$10 billion in 1990 to $26 billion today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even the most dire projections of the memory market going
forward are $15 billion,'' said Dataquest analyst Nathan Brookwood.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus has already signed deals with all of the major makers of
DRAM in the world, most of which are based in Asia.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company has positioned their technology to become the next
standard for main memory used in PCs,'' said analyst Edelstone.
``Within the next five years, I expect that Rambus technology will
dominate the DRAM market.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, however, only 1 percent of DRAM chips manufactured use
Rambus technology, Tate said. Even in a shrinking market, if Rambus
doubles its market share to 2 percent, it rakes in a tidy sum.
``Small companies can grow through down cycles and up cycles,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The company faces no direct competition, although Tate notes
that the DRAM makers are trying to come up with their own standard.
</P>
<P>
   If memory vendors find their own way of making chips run faster
without infringing any of Rambus' 40 patents, the company could
face a tough fight, Dataquest's Brookwood said.
</P>
<P>
   Tate, a Canadian, came to Rambus after its founding. He had
already left his job as vice president in charge of chipmaker AMD's
microprocessor and logic group. ``I had left to run my own startup,
but this idea seemed even crazier,'' Tate said.
</P>
<P>
   When he was growing up, Tate said he never listened to his
mother very much, but he does recall her advice: ``Do what's fun.
If you aren't having fun, you aren't going to be good at it.''
</P>
<P>
   He's tried to instill that atmosphere at Rambus. The company
takes workers and their families to a baseball game every year.
Employees work hard, Tate said, but turnover is low, and ``there's
no perks for the hierarchy.''
</P>
<P>
   He runs an egalitarian operation, in which he works in a
cubicle, and doesn't even have a secretary _ or a better computer
than anyone else. He hopes to avert the bureaucratic underpinnings
of big companies.
</P>
<P>
   Rambus went public in May 1997, again following what Tate
called &QL; 
``counter-intuitive'' thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective in going public was not to raise cash,'' he
said. ``We already had $30 million in the bank and a positive cash
flow.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Tate said, the company sought to reward employees who
had received much of their pay in stock options and were wondering,
``Is this paper ever going to be worth anything?''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, being in the market raised Rambus's visibility.
</P>
<P>
   The stock peaked in August at $86.50, but gradually fell to a
52-week low of $35.50 last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why didn't I buy that one when it was $35?'' analyst Brookwood
asked, somewhat rhetorically.
</P>
<P>
   The stock began its latest ascent on June 22, when Rambus
announced that Santa Clara-based Intel, the world's largest
chipmaker, was testing Direct Rambus DRAMs made by Toshiba and LG
Semicon. In addition, personal computer makers Compaq and Dell
confirmed their intention to ship PCs using Direct Rambus next
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody saw something, I assume, in the press release,'' Tate
said. ``It was just another milestone.''
</P>
<P>
   The stock stampeded up, from $38.81 Friday, to $46.50 Monday, to
$57.25 Tuesday. It has stayed at roughly that level, or slightly
higher, in heavy trading since then.
</P>
<P>
   But Tate's eye is not on the ticker, and the analysts agree.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to keep your eye on the longer term,'' said Morgan
Stanley's Edelstone. ``The revenues and earnings the company is
generating today will pale in comparison to what you can expect in
2003 and 2004.''

MUELLER'S BLAST WINS IT FOR GIANTS 
</HEADLINE>
   By HENRY SCHULMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Giants are learning what many of the Anaheim
Angels' opponents already know. A 2-0 lead against these guys is as
worthless as a dime at a downtown San Francisco parking meter. Of
the 22 games the Angels won in June, they came from behind in 12.
</P>
<P>
   But the Angels are learning something about the Giants, too:
Their guests from the north have some pretty strong innards
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   When the Angels came back to tie Wednesday night's game 2-2 in
the eighth inning, the Giants did not slither into the darkness and
let Anaheim win. Instead, they attacked, and they rode Bill
Mueller's improbable three-run homer off Greg Cadaret in the 10th
inning to a 6-3 victory that did not sit well with 24,299 fans at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys are tough at home. They're as tough at home as we
are,'' Giants manager Dusty Baker said. ``The visiting team rarely
wins extra-inning games on the road, so we defied two odds
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Mueller hit his sixth homer on a 1-2 pitch after twice failing
to sacrifice pinch-runner Shawn Estes to third and Darryl Hamilton
to second.
</P>
<P>
   The other key play in the rally was also a bunt. After Brent
Mayne opened the inning with a single, Hamilton was asked to
sacrifice Estes to second. But his bunt rolled hard past a diving
Cadaret, and nobody could field it. Hamilton had a single, and the
Giants had two on and nobody out.
</P>
<P>
   Mueller fouled off his first bunt try and fouled off the second.
Cadaret then did Mueller's job for him by throwing a wild pitch
that advanced the runners to third and second.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a stroke of good luck,'' said Mayne, whose sacrifice
fly in the fifth inning broke a scoreless tie. ``He had a couple of
chances to lay the bunt down, and the guy wild-pitches them over
anyway. You know things are going your way then.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere single could have scored two, but Mueller ripped the next
pitch into the left-field bullpen for a three-run homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of those strange things,'' Baker said. ``The guys on
the bench were saying, `Who gave him the bunt sign?' They were
joking about it. The key was the wild pitch. That was good
baserunning by Shawn to get to third.''
</P>
<P>
   The homer should not have been a huge surprise. Mueller hit
eight of his first 12 career home runs in games pitched by Estes.
Estes did not throw Wednesday night, but he was on base, and the
mere sight of him seems to make Mueller's forearms bulge.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, anytime Mueller hits a homer he surprises himself. At
least he wasn't mad at himself for missing those bunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the wild pitch, my job is to get a fly ball and get a
run in. You can't worry about what you didn't do. You've got to
worry about what you can do. You have to live in the present, not
the past,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants added a run on a Charlie Hayes double and J.T. Snow
single, completing a four-run outburst that made a winner out of
new All-Star Robb Nen (6-1), who started his night by striking out
the side in the ninth inning. The Angels scored an unearned run off
him in the bottom of the 10th.
</P>
<P>
   Danny Darwin and John Johnstone combined on a four-hit shutout
through seven innings, and the Giants were leading 2-0 when the
inevitable Angels comeback occurred in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   New pitcher Rich Rodriguez walked Dave Hollins with one out, and
Jim Edmonds brought him home with a first-pitch double into the gap
in left-center. Steve Reed entered the game, and pinch-hitter
Orlando Palmeiro tied it at 2-2 when he hit a soft line drive that
barely eluded a diving Hamilton in center.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Poole, the third pitcher of the inning, retired Garret
Anderson on a soft fly to center to keep the game even.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants forged their 2-0 lead on Mayne's sacrifice fly and a
sixth-inning homer by Barry Bonds, his 18th. Bonds was in a
1-for-19 funk, but he spent a lot of time in the dugout watching
Anaheim starter Steve Sparks throw his knuckleballs and figured he
could time one if he stayed patient.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the guys I was going to hit one,'' Bonds said. ``I
said, `If he throws a knuckler and hangs it up there, I'm going to
hit it out.' I'm not going to make that bet ever again.''
</P>
<P>
   One bet that seems safe: When the Giants and Angels meet, the
game is not over until somebody is shaking hands on the mound. &QL;

ZVEREVA SHOWS SHE CAN STILL BEAT THE ODDS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE JENKINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ She wanders about the Wimbledon grounds as
a transported soul, longing for some other time, very
grunge-fashionable with her leather coats, offbeat jewelry and
sunglasses. Natasha Zvereva is cool, above all. She likes the feel
of a Harley-Davidson beneath her and a brisk wind in her face.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably Martina Navratilova's fault that Zvereva's full
story has been pushed aside. It became a lesser work against
Navratilova's epic, because Martina had it all: The courage, the
honesty and the championships. But now we find Zvereva on the verge
of the Wimbledon finals.
</P>
<P>
   Only a French woman named Nathalie Tauziat stands in her way
after Zvereva's stunning 7-6 (7-4), 6-2 upset of Monica Seles on
Court 1 Wednesday. Perhaps now, at the peak of her career, people
will clear some dust off the library and recall what this
remarkable Belarussian woman accomplished so long ago.
</P>
<P>
   She was just 17 years old in 1989, known by her given name of
Natalia, with a gorgeous backhand and a typically stifled Soviet
lifestyle. She would immerse herself in literature between
tournaments, delving deeply into Chekhov and Tolstoy, imagining
herself a modern-day Anna Karenina.
</P>
<P>
   She favored music from the past _ Hendrix, early Led Zeppelin,
Deep Purple _ and spoke astonishingly perfect English. Americans
were fascinated by the images of this brooding, mysterious
teenager, having little idea what was taking place behind the
scenes of Russian tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, they were stealing her blind. Although the Soviet
tennis federation funded her equipment and travel expenses _ she
had been a professional since the age of 14 _ the program took
every cent of her professional paychecks. As the 1989 Family Circle
Cup tournament approached in Hilton Head, S.C., Zvereva estimated
that some $500,000 of her winnings had been pocketed by the
federation.
</P>
<P>
   That is when she unleashed her bombshell. She was talking to Bud
Collins on national television after losing the final to Steffi
Graf, and when officials handed over her check, she said, ``This
$24,000, it's not money, just a piece of paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Collins, for perhaps the first time in his life, was speechless.
Zvereva was essentially telling Soviet officials that she was fed
up, that she would fight the system and do everything possible to
keep her hard-earned money.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long, difficult struggle. Natalia had a formidable ally
in her father, Marat, a rebellious youth from the Stalin era.
During World War II _ in which he lost his own father in battle _
young Marat would disappear from military school for months at a
time, finally getting expelled at the age of 15. He had been kicked
out of a college in Kiev, as well, before marrying a former
volleyball player and settling in Minsk as a tennis instructor.
</P>
<P>
   With her father's full support, and Soviet officials throwing up
their hands in outrage, Natalia boldly signed a lucrative deal with
ProServ, the heavyweight sports management company. The federation
realized it could only control young Natalia if it could keep her
at home, and there was no chance of that. She moved to the United
States, wore the clothing of a flower-child hippie (``I wish I'd
been here in the '60s''), embraced the capitalist lifestyle _ and
eventually won the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Natalia is a pioneer in our country, for the tennis players
and for the other athletes,'' says the former Soviet great Olga
Morozova. ``She was the first one who did it. After Natalia, our
athletes no longer had to send their winnings home.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory seemed quite enough for Natasha, a name she fancied
and took for her own. Navratilova became tennis' ultimate pioneer,
defecting from Czechoslovakia, breaking down the barriers of
homophobia, winning every big title in sight, but Natasha just
wanted to  &LR; live.  &LR; She had an occasional breakthrough in singles,
but doubles and partying were her greatest passions. Partnering
mostly with Gigi Fernandez, she racked up five Wimbledon doubles
titles and 20 Grand Slam championships overall.
</P>
<P>
   There is a measure of genius in her game, a surgeon's touch and
a fine mixture of pace. Before this Wimbledon even started, Seles
said, ``Natasha has the best hands in the game.'' Fellow players
were shocked when she knocked off Steffi Graf in the third round,
but only because she had kept up her concentration for an entire
match. There was never a question about the talent.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, in the sun and refreshing breezes of a Wimbledon
afternoon, Natasha dominated Seles. She seemed pleasantly frozen at
the baseline, a vision of confidence in wraparound shades,
dictating the entire match from that position as Seles scrambled
wildly about. Lobs, drop shots, slices, topspin _ it was all there,
all perfectly disguised. ``My performance really bugs me,'' said
Seles. ``I got all uptight with myself and was just all over the
place. But Natasha rose to the occasion. I did not. She played
really smart tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Zvereva, addressing the media in her accent-free English, said
she had surprised herself _ ``big-time. I am absolutely thrilled.
This is completely unexpected.'' Now it's the semifinals, when the
world really starts to pay attention. Perhaps some will remember
what happened in the dark ages of Russian tennis, when a bright
young teenager knocked down the establishment.

VENUS DONE IN BY NOVOTNA, TEARS 
</HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE JENKINS  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ For the first time in memory, people could
truly relate to Venus Williams on Wednesday. She comes from a very
different background _ home-schooled, Jehovah's Witness, out of a
Compton ghetto _ but everyone knows what it is like to cry. To try
to fight back. To resume the task at hand with your cheeks still
flushed from tears.
</P>
<P>
   It was entirely the wrong thing to do, of course. Tennis is a
game of composure, and if you insist on throwing tantrums, you had
better be pretty damned good. Venus Williams is just 18 years old
and playing her second Wimbledon. But in a 7-5, 7-6 (7-2)
quarterfinal loss to Jana Novotna Wednesday, her world seemed a bit
closer to home.
</P>
<P>
   This whole day had been tumultuous on the women's side. Natasha
Zvereva knocked off Monica Seles in a result that surprised even
Natasha herself. Lindsay Davenport, No.2 in the seedings and the
world, found herself being dominated 6-3, 6-3 at the hands of
Nathalie Tauziat. And Martina Hingis was run around the court
without mercy before outlasting Arantxa Sanchez Vicario, 6-3, 3-6,
6-3.
</P>
<P>
   It means that Hingis will meet Novotna in Thursday's semifinals,
a rematch of last year's Wimbledon final. It brings the
incomprehensible Zvereva-Tauziat matchup in the other semifinal.
But if there is a lasting image from Wednesday's play, it is the
coltish, haughty Venus Williams showing some real emotion.
</P>
<P>
   Basically, she just couldn't take it any more. A couple of
dubious calls had gone Novotna's way, right along with the first
set, and Venus was trailing 0-2 when a looping Novotna forehand was
called ``good'' in the top left corner of the court.
</P>
<P>
   Venus went haywire _ especially by her standards. She cried out,
stomped around, gestured menacingly toward the linesperson and the
chair umpire.
</P>
<P>
   Television replays showed the ball was either good or a
half-inch out, but for Venus, it was highway robbery. ``I've never
seen her get that upset,'' said former tour player Pam Shriver, who
has followed Williams since her debut at the Oakland Coliseum Arena
four years ago. ``She never loses it like she did right there.''
</P>
<P>
   Venus clawed her way back into the set, and it was 3-3, 15-30 on
her serve when another close call went Novotna's way. Williams
double-faulted on the next point, handing the game over like a
gift, and her lips were trembling as she sat during the changeover.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an all-out sobbing fit, but she got a little misty.
She dabbed at her eyes with a towel. Then, most remarkably, she
stormed out there with fresh resolve, breaking Novotna's serve for
4-4.
</P>
<P>
   The match turned toward Novotna from that point on, for one big
reason: Novotna has played the serve-and-volley game all her life
(without Martina Navratilova, she's the only one left on the
women's tour), and Venus is still trying to figure it out. So the
result was not a big surprise. Venus' temperament was a bigger
issue.
</P>
<P>
   After being convinced that she was crying _ at first she denied
it _ Williams said, ``I was upset. If I wasn't so dark, I would
probably turn red (laughter). I don't have a tendency to do that.
But I think maybe the crowd enjoyed my emotional outbursts. Someone
probably turned on the channel, saw some girl screaming and kept it
there. I know I would. It probably brightened up someone's day.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport's day was about as bright as soot, so overwhelming was
Tauziat's performance. Davenport said she ``had a good cry, for
about two minutes'' afterward, but then took heart in one of her
better Wimbledon tournaments. ``Nathalie's great on grass, and
that's the best she's ever played against me,'' said Davenport, who
had won the last seven meetings. ``She was just a better player by
far.''
</P>
<P>
   For Hingis, every match is rife with doubt. She's out of shape,
she's overconfident, she doesn't look that great _ the criticism
comes from all angles. But always she's there at the finish,
flashing an Audrey Hepburn smile to the crowd, pleasantly signing
autographs and moving on to the next round.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arantxa was just chasing everything down, really running me
around,'' said Hingis. ``So it's lots of running on grass. I think
maybe I strained my back a little. Grass looks like it's soft, but
it's not. Like the England-Argentina (soccer) game, at the end,
everybody was holding their backs after the match. I feel the same
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hingis seemed to favor the 30-year-old Tauziat against Zvereva,
saying, ``Nathalie is very smart and clever. She's been around, she
can close it out. She's not afraid of winning.''
</P>
<P>
   And for one day, Venus Williams wasn't afraid to show some
emotion. At this relatively drab Wimbledon, that's fast-breaking
news.

PATENTS: BRACELET FOR MONITORING PAROLEES; CONTACT LENS FOR
INTENSIFYING LIGHT; FAMOUS WRITER'S SCRAPBOOK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By TERESA RIORDAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the 1960s television series ``The Prisoner,'' the captors of
a British spy known as No. 6 have constant knowledge of his
whereabouts, thanks to large glowing spheres that guard the island
on which he is confined.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Heiser, a lawyer turned entrepreneur, has just patented
a different type of technology that nonetheless sounds as if it
could have kept efficient track of No. 6.
</P>
<P>
   Heiser said he was not developing his tracking technology to
keep tabs on wayward spies, however. Rather, his idea was to
constantly monitor the location of felons who are on parole.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of all crime is committed by the same 20
percent of people over and over again,'' Heiser said. ``The major
function of this is to shut down recidivist crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Heiser and his colleagues have patented a bracelet embedded with
a computer chip that receives and transmits radio signals. The
bracelet triangulates the parolee's position every 30 seconds and
relays this information back to a central computer.
</P>
<P>
   Such a system could instantly monitor parole violations _ if,
say, a parolee failed to show up for work or left a prescribed
geographic area.
</P>
<P>
   The bracelets would have three lights, according to Heiser:
green, yellow and red. ``Yellow means that there is a problem and
you have 30 minutes to call in,'' he said. ``Red means the police
are notified.''
</P>
<P>
   The most important feature of Heiser's invention, however, is
that police can enter the time and place of recent crimes into a
computer and receive a printout of every parolee who was nearby at
the time of the offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``To eliminate the taste of Big Brother, this is the only kind
of routine inquiry permitted,'' Heiser said. ``Without a court
order, they can't ask us where you were for the past three weeks.`
</P>
<P>
   The bracelet could help relieve prison overcrowding by letting
low-risk offenders out early, Heiser said. ``It's cheaper to put
people on the bracelet than keep them in prison _ especially if
they aren't going to walk around the corner and kill someone,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Heiser, who plans to test the technology next year in Lincoln,
Neb., said the system would rely on radio transmissions subleased
from entities that already have the rights to certain frequencies.
The advantage of such a system _ which uses transmissions from
land-based towers rather than satellite signals _ is that the
transmissions could be encrypted and would be less likely to be
interrupted by tall buildings or mountains, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But couldn't the bracelets just be cut off, as some home-arrest
bracelets have been? Yes, but this is not something Heiser worries
about. ``If you do that, you have just put yourself on a short list
of suspects,'' he said. ``After all, you didn't cut it off because
it clashed with your tuxedo.''
</P>
<P>
   Patent 5,748,148 was granted to Heiser as well as Joanna Mary
Malvino, Charles M. Wohl, and Fausto Poza, all of whom are
affiliated with HMW Consulting Inc. of Reno, Nev., which has been
assigned the patent.

<P>
   New Contact Lens Intensifies Light
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, Patricia Bowling began suffering from a viral
inflammation that infected her eyes and impaired her vision. So Dr.
Bowling, who is a physician, began researching retinal disease,
including macular degeneration _ a leading and incurable cause of
blindness in old people.
</P>
<P>
   What these eye diseases had in common, she discovered, was an
across-the-board reduction in the number of rods and cones, the
retinal cells that perceive light and color.
</P>
<P>
   It occurred to Dr. Bowling that if she could focus and intensify
light on the remaining rods and cones, she could improve vision. So
she developed a special contact lens that does exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bowling makes a computer printout of the good areas of the
eye in an individual patient and then uses this to impose a pattern
of pinholes on the contact lenses that match the areas of the eye
that are still dense with rods and cones.
</P>
<P>
   These pinholes allow light to strike the rods and cones
perpendicularly. At this 90-degree angle the retinal cells perceive
light to be much brighter than they otherwise would. (The lenses
are kept from shifting by a tiny weight that keeps them in place.)
</P>
<P>
   The lenses will require approval by the Food and Drug
Administration before they can be sold. But does Dr. Bowling use
the lens herself? ``You bet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Bowling received patent 5,719,656. Bruce Lagerman, an
intellectual-property attorney, in Reston, Va., who represents Dr.
Bowling, said she would like to license it to a large contact-lens
manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
   A Little History Lesson
</P>
<P>
   And now for a brief quiz on patent trivia.
</P>
<P>
   Question: What important American writer patented a self-pasting
scrapbook 125 years ago this summer?
</P>
<P>
   Answer: Mark Twain. He received his patent on June 24, 1873.
</P>
<P>
   Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and
Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lettering on the door sums up the business model: ``Your
branch office-Open 24 hours.'' Kinko's, once known simply as the
leading chain of printing and copy shops, has recast itself for the
work-obsessed digital age.
</P>
<P>
   Where there once were only copy machines, the 902 Kinko's stores
in this country and abroad now feature a uniform mixture of fax
machines, ultra-fast color printers and networks of computers
equipped with popular software programs and high-speed Internet
connections.
</P>
<P>
   Many business people, while traveling, have come to regard
Kinko's as their office away from home, stopping in to check their
e-mail or otherwise make quick use of a computer. And laptop
stations let business travelers plug their notebook computers into
any of several different printers for making copies of
presentations while on the road.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many a home-office worker has come to rely on
Kinko's as the well-appointed office outside the house. At last
count, there were nearly 40 million Americans working out of their
homes with the help of electronic conveniences like cell phones,
fax machines and hand-held organizers. And on any given day, tens
of thousands of them stop by a Kinko's store, whether to make
temporary use of a high-resolution color printer or to find
something else the home office does not have: other people.
</P>
<P>
   As millions more people join the work-at-home trend each year,
Kinko's appears to be doing what many people envisioned cybercafes
would do _ offer an escape from the isolation that this abundance
of modern technology seems to have created. For social mixing,
there's nothing quite like trying to bring a PC to heel in a public
place.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get frustrated, so you end up meeting people,'' said Peter
Goggin, a Web site designer with Epicenter Communications Inc., in
Sausalito, Calif., who regularly stops by Kinko's to make color
prints. ``Sometimes you share tips.'' It is precisely the kind of
pay-by-the-hour collaboration that gladdens the heart of Kinko's
chairman, Paul Orfalea, who founded the company as a campus
photocopying business in 1970. Since then, he has nurtured the
privately held outfit into a chain with revenues now estimated at
$1 billion. And if all goes as planned, he may finally take Kinko's
public next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as a kid I knew that someday I'd be running a big
company,'' Orfalea, 50, said recently at his office in Ventura,
Calif. But he said the company had been waiting for a major
reorganization to take hold before embarking on a public offering.
``Like in a marriage, Wall Street wants consistency and fidelity,
and we're waiting until we can provide that.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to an expansion into computer services that Orfalea began
in the late 1980s, as the number of home workers and digital road
warriors increases every year, so do Kinko's revenues. The company
is the leader in the $7 billion copy-services market, despite
competitors that include Sir Speedy, Alpha Graphics and Kwik Copy,
along with in-store copy departments at office supply warehouses
such as Office Max's Copy Max, Staples and Office Depot.
</P>
<P>
   And the company's computing services side, now accounting for
about a third of its sales, is growing even faster _ with no direct
competition on a national scale. While other copy chains sell
computer time, and some even offer e-mail and Internet access, none
appear to match Kinko's when it comes to the number of branches.
</P>
<P>
   And Kinko's, which charges $12 an hour for computer use, is
hoping to increase its share of industry revenue by getting people
to spend more time _ and hence, more money _ at its stores. Besides
adding equipment, the company is talking to Starbucks about opening
up coffee shops adjacent to some Kinko's stores, and is looking at
other services to get people to come more often and stay longer,
such as package shipping and banking. Orfalea is also considering
opening mini-Kinko's in airports and hotel lobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Another growing in-store business for Kinko's is video
conferencing, which the company now offers in 140 stores throughout
the country.
</P>
<P>
   William Campbell, a buyer for Applebee's International, a
restaurant chain based in Shawnee Mission, Kan., relies on the
local Kinko's video conferencing site there to conduct screening
interviews with job candidates, and estimates that each $150 to
$300 video session saves more than $1,000 in travel expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Applebee's applicants simply have to show up at their local
Kinko's, where they speak to a video camera while watching the
interviewer on a television screen. If a local Kinko's does not
have video conferencing equipment, Kinko's will make arrangements
with another conferencing center in the same town, possibly one run
by Sprint or another phone company.
</P>
<P>
   It is not exactly the same as meeting in the flesh, but ``you
can still see their body language and their facial expressions, and
that tells you a lot,'' said Campbell, who expects the Kinko's
video conferences to save his company $250,000 this year in travel
expenses.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all of Kinko's innovations, a successful public stock
offering is no sure bet, of course.
</P>
<P>
   But neither was getting even this far in the business world for
Orfalea, who had never envisioned Kinko's becoming a huge
operation. As a 22-year-old with kinky red hair that inspired the
business' name, he opened his first copying service in 1970,
setting up shop behind a taco stand in Santa Barbara, Calif., to
serve students at the University of California campus there.
</P>
<P>
   When the company began expanding into a string of partnerships
with individual investors in the late 1970s, Orfalea held a
majority stake in each one. But his direct involvement in each
store, which allowed for an informal corporate style, eventually
became untenable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We outgrew the old structure,'' Orfalea said. ``Just trying to
get all the stores to look alike was nearly impossible. In 1981 I
started trying to get all the stores to be painted blue; in 1992, I
went into a store and it was still green. It used to be OK to have
that kind of independent thinking, but now we have to be
consistent.''

IMPOTENCE PILL THE LATEST DRUG PEDDLED ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Viagra and the Internet appear to be ushering in
a new brand of high-tech drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in California and Colorado said Wednesday that they
are beginning investigations of an online pharmacy operation,
Performance Drugs Inc., which has been supplying Viagra and other
medicines through the Web without traditional prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations were prompted in part by inquiries from a
Chronicle reporter, who had ordered 10 tablets of Viagra, the
wildly popular new anti-impotence pill, and 10 doses of
``Stimula,'' a purported ``female erectile cream,'' through the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Drugs is just one of a growing crop of Web-based
pill mills exploiting the phenomenal demand for Pfizer Inc.'s
impotence remedy. A record 2.5 million Viagra prescriptions have
been filled since the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has issued statements decrying loose prescribing of
Viagra _ a potentially dangerous medicine linked to 174 reports of
side effects and 31 deaths, although it's not clear whether the
drug itself or underlying health problems were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   However, the New York-based pharmaceutical giant conceded that
it has done nothing to stop questionable sales through the
Internet. Nor has the company been systematically monitoring the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said Internet sales appear to be legal in
many states, ``so there's not much we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators said anyone, including the manufacturer, could
prompt an investigation simply by filing a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The pills received by The Chronicle appear to be genuine _
blue-colored, oblong tablets stamped with Pfizer's logo. The
newspaper is having the pills tested for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   To get them, the reporter was only required to fill out a short
``medical history'' online through an easy-to-find, well-promoted
Web site. Besides agreeing to a $99.50 charge on a credit card, he
also agreed to pay a $50 ``physician review charge'' for first-time
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The form did not ask whether the reporter was suffering from
impotence _ the only condition for which the Food and Drug
Administration has approved Viagra. He did not even have to reveal
his age or gender. No doctor or pharmacist contacted him.
</P>
<P>
   Since The Chronicle submitted its order, the online form has
been revised, and customers must now provide more detailed
information.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Performance Drugs were answered by Mike Takano, who
identified himself as president of Alliance Marketing in Seattle,
which he said has a partnership with Performance Drugs to handle
the phone calls and other business generated by the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He said the drug company was founded by a Colorado physician,
Dr. Benjamin Taylor Johnson. Johnson, 31, is a 1994 graduate of
Creighton University in Nebraska who practices at a clinic in
Denver called the Center for Body Enhancement. Records of the
Colorado medical board indicate that Johnson has a valid license to
practice in that state and has no record of disciplinary action
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's name appeared on the drug packaging received by The
Chronicle as the prescribing doctor. He did not return repeated
telephone calls this week.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and regulators said it is bad practice, and possibly
illegal, for a doctor to order prescription drugs for patients he
has never met or examined. Nor does Johnson have a license to
prescribe medicine to someone in San Francisco, according to a
record check by the Medical Board of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely not legal unless there's a good-faith
examination by a doctor licensed to practice medicine in
California,'' said Doug Laue, deputy director of the state board.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Miller, program administrator of the Colorado Board of
Medical Examiners, said, ``The board may have problems with what he
is doing and certainly we will be investigating that.'' Regulators
said the willy-nilly sale of Viagra and other prescription drugs
over the Web is a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this on our radar screen,'' said Carmen Catizone,
executive director of the National Association of Boards of
Pharmacy, which is developing a ``seal of approval'' for Web sites
that follow what are considered sound guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's against the law to dispense a prescription drug to
someone without a legitimate prescription,'' he said, adding that
filling prescriptions based only on Web questionnaires, without any
semblance of a patient-physician relationship, clearly will not
pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site in Wisconsin jumped on the Viagra bandwagon soon
after the drug was approved but promptly closed under pressure from
state medical authorities. Another site with a sponsor based in
Arizona also has apparently come and gone. In California, however,
officials said they had not looked into the matter until questioned
this week by The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   State telemedicine statutes and other provisions traditionally
allow physicians to conduct business over the phone or by fax, as
long as they exercise sound judgment and act in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Few doctors consider it good judgment to fill a telephone
prescription requested by someone they have not physically examined
before.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing Viagra prescriptions to total strangers, even if they
fill out detailed forms on the Internet, ``is not a good idea,''
said Dr. Tom Lue, a nationally known urologist on the faculty of
the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although Viagra is by far the main attraction, Web sites also
are advertising baldness treatments, female ``sexual enhancement''
creams and other drugs that usually cannot be purchased legally
without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Drugs, one of the more visible Viagra-peddlers on
the Internet, has made no secret of the business. The company even
issued a press release in May advertising ``worldwide access'' to
Viagra, even though the drug has been approved only in a few
countries outside the United States so far.
</P>
<P>
   Takano said the service is extremely popular with customers all
over the country. He declined to offer details other than saying
that the Web service has received no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   As for the legalities, Takano said the Web service employs
plenty of lawyers to make sure no laws are broken. Still, he added,
``this kind of falls into the frontier; it's in uncharted waters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no real statutes for or against it,'' he said. ``We
meet with doctors. We pay doctors quite a bit of money to review
prescriptions. The doctors can reject every order if they want.
We're relying on the physician's judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's Viagra-Stimula order was shipped by U.S. mail
from Pencol-Medisave Pharmacy, which listed a Denver address.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered a telephone request for an interview at the
pharmacy identified himself as Marshall Tobin. He initially refused
to answer any questions, and he ended the conversation shortly
after a reporter declined to grant him anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not in any jeopardy,'' Tobin said, claiming that he
did not know all the details about the Web supply operation when
The Chronicle reporter's order was filled.
</P>
<P>
   But he then added that he has since stopped filling such orders.
``It was the wrong thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra still appears to be safe and effective when used as
intended, according to the FDA. The most serious known side effects
have been listed on the drug label since it was approved.
</P>
<P>
   One known risk is the strain that sexual activity could have on
newly potent men in poor health. The drug can trigger potentially
fatal drops in blood pressure in heart patients taking nitrate
drugs _ an increasingly common problem in emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's also potentially dangerous to combine Viagra with the
inhaled recreational nitrates known as ``poppers.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of the demand for the drug, doctors say, is in
recreational use by men who are not impotent but seek to enhance
their sexual prowess, even though the drug evidently does nothing
for men who have no problems achieving erections. The pill also is
being tested by the manufacturer as a sexual aid for women.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities said the Viagra traffic on the Internet opens
the possibility that the drug will fall into the hands of children
or people refused prescriptions by their doctors, presumably for
fear of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about this,'' said Dr. James Winn,
executive vice president of the Federation of State Medical Boards,
a Texas-based organization that advises state physician-licensing
agencies across the country. ``This is bad medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn's organization issued a memorandum last week warning state
medical boards about the Performance Drugs Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is ``technically not illegal,'' the memo stated,
but ``does raise flags about the quality of medicine being
practiced by physicians who have agreed to write prescriptions for
the individuals placing orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous gossip about what the medication might do for
normally functioning men _ or perhaps even women _ has prompted
phenomenal demand for the pills, even at $9 or more a pop.
</P>
<P>
   In some Bay Area neighborhoods, the pills can be had on the
street with little more difficulty than copping a bag of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said one San Francisco police investigator,
confirming that Viagra is being passed around in some bars for $20
or $30 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   But local authorities noted that it's merely a misdemeanor to
possess prescription medications without a prescription. A felony
could be charged if large quantities are involved, but successful
prosecution would require showing intent to sell the drug _ and
that's not easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the Food and Drug Administration step in. The agency has
no authority over how pharmacies and physicians use an approved
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Nightingale, associate FDA commissioner for health
affairs, said some Web sites may be treading on dangerous legal
ground, however, citing at least two past instances of a provider
being shut down by state and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has joined in a global effort through the World Health
Organization to reach effective cross-border agreements to monitor
pharmaceutical marketing in the online era.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several countries hope to reach agreements for a
cooperative program that would force pill mills out of business
wherever they might arise.
</P>
<P>
   The world health group has even adopted a resolution against
unlicensed cross-border sales of prescription drugs, although the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a Washington
trade group, said WHO lacks authority to deal effectively with the
problem.

UNDATED: be consistent.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The limitations of the company's ad hoc structure became
painfully evident when Kinko's started adding data communications
to its list of business services in 1996. Because each region was
proceeding at its own pace and installing different brands and
technologies, the stores were frequently unable to meet the needs
of traveling customers who wanted to use the same printing
technology or software wherever they went.
</P>
<P>
   Then, too, the company needed capital if it intended to compete
in the emerging market for digital printing, in which high-speed
color copying machines can cost $100,000 or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bigger the monster got, you began to wonder which tentacle
was the head,'' said Lloyd Greif, an investment banker in Los
Angeles who follows the printing industry.
</P>
<P>
   In search of a solution, Kinko's board retained the investment
firm of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Company in 1996 to help it find investors.
By the end of the year, Orfalea and his colleagues had selected
Clayton, Dublier &AMP; Rice, the same private investment and management
company that had taken IBM's struggling printer business and turned
it into the publicly traded Lexmark in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton, Dublier &AMP; Rice bought a third of Kinko's for $219
million in early 1997 and proceeded to roll the partnerships into a
single corporate entity, centralizing all management functions
within Kinko's headquarters in Ventura. In the process, roughly a
third of the partners sold their stakes back to the company and
left, while the remaining ones changed roles, becoming executives
and managers within the newly centralized organization.
</P>
<P>
   Then in mid-1997, the company replaced Orfalea as chief
executive with Joseph Hardin Jr., the former president and chief
executive of Wal-Mart's Sam's Club discount supermarket warehouse
chain who had seen Sam's Club through a decade of rapid growth.
</P>
<P>
   Besides streamlining management, the centralized structure
allows Kinko's to take advantage of bulk discounts when acquiring
costly new hardware, software and network services. And though the
size of the stores may vary, these days all Kinko's stores now have
the same decor and basically the same equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we had a lot of maverick innovation,'' said Doug
Wilkins, who manages a Kinko's in San Francisco. ``Now you can go
into any Kinko's and find the same thing. Things work better.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that everything is completely smooth sailing. Inevitably,
customers still run into problems when they try to use unfamiliar
programs and equipment. And even though the company is hiring new
employees as fast as it can find them, a certain degree of chaos
reminiscent of the company's start-up days still prevails. Over the
last few years, Orfalea and his management team have tried to
address these issues by beefing up the company's training centers
scattered throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   Orfalea, who remains the company's chairman, now acts as
something of an ambassador for Kinko's, traveling from store to
store and scouting new markets overseas. Kinko's has 43 foreign
branches, mainly in Canada and Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's sort of the Johnny Appleseed of new ideas,'' said Donald
Gogel, the Clayton, Dublier &AMP; Rice partner who led Kinko's through
the reorganization and acted as interim chief executive until
Hardin was hired. ``He travels around picking up new ideas and
scattering them about. He's contagiously enthusiastic.''
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest challenge remains the need to keep investing in
new digital technology, an expensive proposition that requires a
constant stream of investment capital, Greif, the investment
banker, said. That challenge has kept Kinko's from expanding as
quickly as it had hoped, he said, which is why the company now
feels the need to raise money in the public stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Just early last year, Kinko's executives, in a burst of
enthusiasm they now regret, said they hoped to have 2,000 stores
open by the year 2000. With less than half that number today, the
company will fall far short of that goal. ``They'll get there,''
Greif said, ``just perhaps not as fast as they'd like.''

IMPOTENCE PILL THE LATEST DRUG PEDDLED ON THE WEB 
</HEADLINE>
   By CARL T. HALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Viagra and the Internet appear to be ushering in
a new brand of high-tech drug abuse.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities in California and Colorado said Wednesday that they
are beginning investigations of an online pharmacy operation,
Performance Drugs Inc., which has been supplying Viagra and other
medicines through the Web without traditional prescriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The investigations were prompted in part by inquiries from a
Chronicle reporter, who had ordered 10 tablets of Viagra, the
wildly popular new anti-impotence pill, and 10 doses of
``Stimula,'' a purported ``female erectile cream,'' through the Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Drugs is just one of a growing crop of Web-based
pill mills exploiting the phenomenal demand for Pfizer Inc.'s
impotence remedy. A record 2.5 million Viagra prescriptions have
been filled since the drug was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   Pfizer has issued statements decrying loose prescribing of
Viagra _ a potentially dangerous medicine linked to 174 reports of
side effects and 31 deaths, although it's not clear whether the
drug itself or underlying health problems were to blame.
</P>
<P>
   However, the New York-based pharmaceutical giant conceded that
it has done nothing to stop questionable sales through the
Internet. Nor has the company been systematically monitoring the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokeswoman said Internet sales appear to be legal in
many states, ``so there's not much we can do about it.''
</P>
<P>
   State regulators said anyone, including the manufacturer, could
prompt an investigation simply by filing a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   The pills received by The Chronicle appear to be genuine _
blue-colored, oblong tablets stamped with Pfizer's logo. The
newspaper is having the pills tested for authenticity.
</P>
<P>
   To get them, the reporter was only required to fill out a short
``medical history'' online through an easy-to-find, well-promoted
Web site. Besides agreeing to a $99.50 charge on a credit card, he
also agreed to pay a $50 ``physician review charge'' for first-time
customers.
</P>
<P>
   The form did not ask whether the reporter was suffering from
impotence _ the only condition for which the Food and Drug
Administration has approved Viagra. He did not even have to reveal
his age or gender. No doctor or pharmacist contacted him.
</P>
<P>
   Since The Chronicle submitted its order, the online form has
been revised, and customers must now provide more detailed
information.
</P>
<P>
   Calls to Performance Drugs were answered by Mike Takano, who
identified himself as president of Alliance Marketing in Seattle,
which he said has a partnership with Performance Drugs to handle
the phone calls and other business generated by the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   He said the drug company was founded by a Colorado physician,
Dr. Benjamin Taylor Johnson. Johnson, 31, is a 1994 graduate of
Creighton University in Nebraska who practices at a clinic in
Denver called the Center for Body Enhancement. Records of the
Colorado medical board indicate that Johnson has a valid license to
practice in that state and has no record of disciplinary action
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's name appeared on the drug packaging received by The
Chronicle as the prescribing doctor. He did not return repeated
telephone calls this week.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians and regulators said it is bad practice, and possibly
illegal, for a doctor to order prescription drugs for patients he
has never met or examined. Nor does Johnson have a license to
prescribe medicine to someone in San Francisco, according to a
record check by the Medical Board of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely not legal unless there's a good-faith
examination by a doctor licensed to practice medicine in
California,'' said Doug Laue, deputy director of the state board.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Miller, program administrator of the Colorado Board of

prescribe medicine to someone in San Francisco, according to a
record check by the Medical Board of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is absolutely not legal unless there's a good-faith
examination by a doctor licensed to practice medicine in
California,'' said Doug Laue, deputy director of the state board.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Miller, program administrator of the Colorado Board of
Medical Examiners, said, ``The board may have problems with what he
is doing and certainly we will be investigating that.'' Regulators
said the willy-nilly sale of Viagra and other prescription drugs
over the Web is a growing problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have this on our radar screen,'' said Carmen Catizone,
executive director of the National Association of Boards of
Pharmacy, which is developing a ``seal of approval'' for Web sites
that follow what are considered sound guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's against the law to dispense a prescription drug to
someone without a legitimate prescription,'' he said, adding that
filling prescriptions based only on Web questionnaires, without any
semblance of a patient-physician relationship, clearly will not
pass muster.
</P>
<P>
   One Web site in Wisconsin jumped on the Viagra bandwagon soon
after the drug was approved but promptly closed under pressure from
state medical authorities. Another site with a sponsor based in
Arizona also has apparently come and gone. In California, however,
officials said they had not looked into the matter until questioned
this week by The Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   State telemedicine statutes and other provisions traditionally
allow physicians to conduct business over the phone or by fax, as
long as they exercise sound judgment and act in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Few doctors consider it good judgment to fill a telephone
prescription requested by someone they have not physically examined
before.
</P>
<P>
   Issuing Viagra prescriptions to total strangers, even if they
fill out detailed forms on the Internet, ``is not a good idea,''
said Dr. Tom Lue, a nationally known urologist on the faculty of
the University of California at San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Although Viagra is by far the main attraction, Web sites also
are advertising baldness treatments, female ``sexual enhancement''
creams and other drugs that usually cannot be purchased legally
without a prescription.
</P>
<P>
   Performance Drugs, one of the more visible Viagra-peddlers on
the Internet, has made no secret of the business. The company even
issued a press release in May advertising ``worldwide access'' to
Viagra, even though the drug has been approved only in a few
countries outside the United States so far.
</P>
<P>
   Takano said the service is extremely popular with customers all
over the country. He declined to offer details other than saying
that the Web service has received no complaints.
</P>
<P>
   As for the legalities, Takano said the Web service employs
plenty of lawyers to make sure no laws are broken. Still, he added,
``this kind of falls into the frontier; it's in uncharted waters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are no real statutes for or against it,'' he said. ``We
meet with doctors. We pay doctors quite a bit of money to review
prescriptions. The doctors can reject every order if they want.
We're relying on the physician's judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle's Viagra-Stimula order was shipped by U.S. mail
from Pencol-Medisave Pharmacy, which listed a Denver address.
</P>
<P>
   A man who answered a telephone request for an interview at the
pharmacy identified himself as Marshall Tobin. He initially refused
to answer any questions, and he ended the conversation shortly
after a reporter declined to grant him anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not in any jeopardy,'' Tobin said, claiming that he
did not know all the details about the Web supply operation when
The Chronicle reporter's order was filled.
</P>
<P>
   But he then added that he has since stopped filling such orders.
``It was the wrong thing to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Viagra still appears to be safe and effective when used as
intended, according to the FDA. The most serious known side effects
have been listed on the drug label since it was approved.
</P>
<P>
   One known risk is the strain that sexual activity could have on
newly potent men in poor health. The drug can trigger potentially
fatal drops in blood pressure in heart patients taking nitrate
drugs _ an increasingly common problem in emergency rooms.
</P>
<P>
   It's also potentially dangerous to combine Viagra with the
inhaled recreational nitrates known as ``poppers.''
</P>
<P>
   But part of the demand for the drug, doctors say, is in
recreational use by men who are not impotent but seek to enhance
their sexual prowess, even though the drug evidently does nothing
for men who have no problems achieving erections. The pill also is
being tested by the manufacturer as a sexual aid for women.
</P>
<P>
   Health authorities said the Viagra traffic on the Internet opens
the possibility that the drug will fall into the hands of children
or people refused prescriptions by their doctors, presumably for
fear of side effects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are very concerned about this,'' said Dr. James Winn,
executive vice president of the Federation of State Medical Boards,
a Texas-based organization that advises state physician-licensing
agencies across the country. ``This is bad medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Winn's organization issued a memorandum last week warning state
medical boards about the Performance Drugs Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The operation is ``technically not illegal,'' the memo stated,
but ``does raise flags about the quality of medicine being
practiced by physicians who have agreed to write prescriptions for
the individuals placing orders.''
</P>
<P>
   Ubiquitous gossip about what the medication might do for
normally functioning men _ or perhaps even women _ has prompted
phenomenal demand for the pills, even at $9 or more a pop.
</P>
<P>
   In some Bay Area neighborhoods, the pills can be had on the
street with little more difficulty than copping a bag of marijuana.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true,'' said one San Francisco police investigator,
confirming that Viagra is being passed around in some bars for $20
or $30 a pill.
</P>
<P>
   But local authorities noted that it's merely a misdemeanor to
possess prescription medications without a prescription. A felony
could be charged if large quantities are involved, but successful
prosecution would require showing intent to sell the drug _ and
that's not easy to do.
</P>
<P>
   Nor can the Food and Drug Administration step in. The agency has
no authority over how pharmacies and physicians use an approved
drug.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Stuart Nightingale, associate FDA commissioner for health
affairs, said some Web sites may be treading on dangerous legal
ground, however, citing at least two past instances of a provider
being shut down by state and local authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The FDA has joined in a global effort through the World Health
Organization to reach effective cross-border agreements to monitor
pharmaceutical marketing in the online era.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in several countries hope to reach agreements for a
cooperative program that would force pill mills out of business
wherever they might arise.
</P>
<P>
   The world health group has even adopted a resolution against
unlicensed cross-border sales of prescription drugs, although the
Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, a Washington
trade group, said WHO lacks authority to deal effectively with the
problem.

RESTORING AIDS-RAVAGED IMMUNE SYSTEM SEEN AS POSSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID PERLMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ The human immune system, ravaged by the attack of the
AIDS virus, may be restored to activity if long-term drug therapy
can hold the virus in check at virtually invisible levels in the
body, researchers reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If early trials in patients prove it can be done, the
achievement would free many AIDS patients from the devastating
bacterial infections that can condemn them to painful deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists at major institutions in Paris and Boston described
their latest efforts at achieving the long-sought goal of ``immune
reconstitution'' in presentations to rapt audiences at the 12th
World AIDS Conference in Geneva. Some experts indicated that the
goal is indeed realistic given more experimental work.
</P>
<P>
   In one report, Dr. Brigitte Autran, a leading virologist at the
Pitie-Salpetriere Hospital in Paris, described the progress of 161
severely ill AIDS patients who were treated for 18 months with
three powerful anti-viral drugs, including one of the new protease
inhibitors.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, the levels of HIV, the AIDS virus, dropped to
undetectable levels in the blood of the patients, although some
latent viruses _ as scientists have known for years _ remained
sequestered as reservoirs in certain cells and lymph tissues.
</P>
<P>
   More significantly, however, levels of newly formed and
uninfected CD4 cells _ the crucial cells of the immune system that
the AIDS virus first invades _ rose four-fold, while other valuable
cells called cytotoxic T lymphocytes that attack virus-infected
cells rose, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Autran's work is among the best in showing that at least
partial reconstruction of the immune system is possible,'' said Dr.
Anthony S. Fauci, one of the world's leading AIDS researchers and
director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   The emergence of the new and valuable CD4 cells in Autran's
experiments poses an unsolved mystery, Fauci said, because those
cells are normally formed by the thymus gland, which is an organ
that shrivels and ceases to function in adults.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now is the time to ask the really tough questions,'' Fauci
added, ``and that is to see if they're going to get immune reponses
active against infectious organisms.''
</P>
<P>
   But Autran had a ready answer. She reported that the new and
uninfected ``naive'' CD4 cells that had emerged in such large
quantity in her patients proved capable in laboratory experiments
of attacking such organisms as those that cause the opportunistic
infections of AIDS like tuberculosis, candididiasis, toxoplasmosis
and even cytomegalovirus disease.
</P>
<P>
   Until such power in apparently restored immune systems is fully
tested in human trials however _ and most specifically in AIDS
patients _ it will not be possible to know that the achievement is
truly complete, Autran agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we need more and larger studies to learn whether full
reconstitution of the immune system against opportunistic
infections _ and perhaps even against HIV _ is possible, we do
believe that recovery of CD4 cells is achievable in advanced
disease,'' Autran said. ``It is dependent on highly active
anti-retroviral therapy that keeps the viral load of HIV down to
undetectable levels for long periods.''
</P>
<P>
   In another report, Dr. Bruce Walker, an AIDS researcher at
Harvard's Massachusetts General Hospital, described how he, too,
has restored the damaged immune systems of a group of patients who
had just developed the first acute symptoms of illness that mark
new HIV infection.
</P>
<P>
   Walker first treated the patients with an anti-viral drug called
Didanosine, also known when it was still experimental as ddI, plus
hydroxea, a well-known drug used in treating leukemia, and a
painkiller in other diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after two years of treatment with a combination of
anti-virals that lowered their virus to undetectable levels,
Walker, too, found evidence that his patients had developed strong
``immune reponses.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker is so convinced of the potential for restoring a
functioning immune system to AIDS patients that he suggested a
carefully controlled clinical trial to learn whether this new
``immunotherapy'' might even make it possible to stop all other
therapy and let the recovered immune systems do the work on their
own against the opportunistic infections of AIDS.

 Tall Texan's Big Words   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Silicon Valley entrepreneur Jim Clark has as many opinions about
the high-tech industry as he has startup ideas. A sampling of his
views:
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ &UR; On former Silicon Graphics Inc. CEO Ed McCracken: &LR;  ``He's a
Napoleon, a classic example of a massive egomaniac. Ed assumed he
was the reason for the company's success, but I fully blame the
current state of SGI on him.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On Microsoft CEO Bill Gates: &LR;  ``A whole library can be written
about Bill Gates' business practices, but it can be distilled in
one sentence: He's a thief.''
</P>
<P>
   (A Microsoft spokeswoman responded: ``It is too bad that the
leader of a fine company would take business issues and make them
so personal.'')
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On Netscape Communications CEO Jim Barksdale: &LR;  ``Jim is like a
Confederate general. There's not too much idle talk, but the man is
a natural leader.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On At Home CEO and former SGI executive Tom Jermoluk: &LR; 
``Outgoing, gregarious, smart. He was the reason behind a lot of
SGI's success, not Ed McCracken.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On building a successful startup.  &LR; ``You can't be too
religious or wedded to your ideas. You have to adapt to keep
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On the Web-browser war. &LR;  ``If Microsoft beats Netscape, the
Internet will be dominated and governed by Microsoft. There will be
no stopping them.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On mixing politics and high tech: &LR;  ``A waste of time. I don't
have the patience. It's hard to make things happen. I remember
testifying before the Senate in the late 1980s and being asked by
(then Senator Al Gore) and others about what we could do to start
an information superhighway. I told them it already exists. They
just needed to pave it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On the Internet. &LR;  ``It has become the standard form of
communication for every (computer) network in the world. The Net is
a massive revolution that has just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; On Microsoft's Windows operating system. &LR;  ``I don't use
Windows, so I got that much going for me.''

   Fall in AT&AMP;T Stock Raises Concern
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T have fallen 16 percent since its planned
acquisition of Tele-Communications for $31.8 billion in stock was
announced last month, leading some to speculate that the deal may
have to be renegotiated in light of the poor shareholder reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Internet Access for Small Fry
</P>
<P>
   Media commentators have greeted the proposed
AT&AMP;T-Tele-Communications merger with a certain skepticism. But not
much has been said about how the deal will affect one of the most
vibrant new industries that now finds itself directly in AT&AMP;T's
path: the largely local, independent Internet service providers.
The cooperative agreements under which 4,000 or so of these
providers transfer trillions of bits of data around the globe, a
system known as peering, could be endangered by competition for
access.
</P>
<P>
   Million-Dollar Sports Talk
</P>
<P>
   Nanci Donnellan, the only female host of a nationally syndicated
sports talk show, is well known for her opinionated, gravelly
over-the-air bellow and lightning-quick repartee. About 250,000
sports fans each month call her 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily call-in
show, transmitted live from New York to 187 stations. It is one of
the few radio programs to generate nearly $1 million in annual
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   Some E-Mails Are Never Answered
</P>
<P>
   A major consumer-products company's customer-service center
received about 20,000 e-mail messages via the Internet in a recent
month. But only 2,000, or about 10 percent, received attentive
replies, and some of these not for several weeks, because many
companies, even those with a seemingly sophisticated presence on
the World Wide Web, continue to treat customer e-mail as
second-class communication.
</P>
<P>
   Online Company Adding 21 Sites
</P>
<P>
   Avram Glazer has letters of intent to buy 21 World Wide Web
sites and aggregate them under one site, www.Zap.com, which is
named after his company, Zapata. Earlier Zapata acquired the online
magazines Word and Charged.
</P>
<P>
   More Globe Columns Questioned
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Globe's investigation of Patricia Smith, the
columnist who resigned last month after it was discovered that she
had invented some of the people she described, has produced
evidence that her fabrications might be far more numerous than
originally reported.
</P>
<P>
   Tabloid Offers a $100,000 Reward
</P>
<P>
   A .38-caliber Taurus revolver that is believed to be the weapon
that killed Ennis Cosby, the son of entertainer Bill Cosby, was
discovered with the help of The National Enquirer, which offered a
$100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and
conviction of the killer of Cosby. The tabloid's reward went beyond
the media's traditional role of announcing rewards offered by
others.

 Tech's High Flier Soars Again   By Jon Swartz  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Jim Clark already has founded two billion-dollar high-tech
companies, and if his latest startup takes off, he could make
Silicon Valley history.
<TEXT>
<P>
   But on a recent morning, he hardly looks like an executive at
the pinnacle of the corporate world.
</P>
<P>
   His voice raspy from a nagging allergy and his gangly body
dulled by a late night of libations, Clark _ who co-founded
Netscape Communications Corp. and Silicon Graphics Inc. and who
currently is shepherding another Internet company with big-time
potential _ is late for an interview and uncharacteristically
reserved.
</P>
<P>
   ``C'mon, let's get some coffee,'' he says, forcing out each
word. ``I need to get started.''
</P>
<P>
   But after a latte at a Menlo Park cafe, he's as animated as some
of the splashy graphics that SGI brought to high-powered
workstations. Opinions and pronouncements rattle out like chat room
conversations on the Internet, the global communications network
which Netscape technology helped popularize.
</P>
<P>
   In a far-ranging, three-hour interview, the tall Texan expounds
on the Internet phenomenon, takes digs at former SGI chief
executive Ed McCracken (``an egomaniac who never looked me straight
in the eyes''), recounts his childhood in Plainview, Texas (``I
grew up in black and white''), discusses academia and politics, and
describes the art of the startup.
</P>
<P>
   ``Impatience is a virtue,'' Clark said, explaining his
business &UR;  &LR; philosophy. ``Entrepreneurship is about not being
satisfied with the way things are done and changing it. And
(potential entrepreneurs) better be interested in making money. If
you're just interested in passion, then go to your playpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark, 54, quit high school at 16 to join the Navy after a
series of hijinks _ including an unsuccessful attempt to smuggle
whiskey on a band trip _ got him suspended &UR; .  &LR; After hauling wheat
in Kansas and generally kicking around, he started college at 20
and eventually earned a doctorate in computer science from the
University of Utah in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  He took a job teaching computer science at the &UR;  &LR; University of
Santa Cruz but found it a disappointment. ``I thought it would be
an idealistic place to teach and walk in the redwoods,'' he said.
``Instead, there was a noses-in-the-clouds attitude that drove me
crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Looking for a more down-to-earth school, he went to teach at
Stanford University, met some computer science students and formed
SGI in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Thus began one of the more remarkable hot streaks in the
high-tech business. In 1984, Clark brought in McCracken as CEO and
the Mountain View company went on to reshape computer-generated
graphics. Its workstations were used to create the special effects
in such movies as ``Jurassic Park'' and ``Terminator 2.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite SGI's early roaring success, Clark's strained, 10-year
relationship with the stoic McCracken resulted in some awkward
moments. Clark recalls one SGI executive meeting:
</P>
<P>
   ``My adolescent daughter couldn't pronounce his name, so she
used to call him Ed `McCrackle' or Ed `McMuffin,' Clark says. ``I
mentioned this, but Ed didn't find it amusing. He said, `It's not
funny to make fun of one's last name.' Meanwhile, everyone around
the table is trying to suppress their laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken says he doesn't remember the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim is a really special, brilliant guy whom I respect a lot,''
said McCracken, who now is chairman of Prasad Project, a South
Fallsburg, N.Y., organization that provides health-care services to
low-income U.S. neighborhoods and developing countries. ``He's an
extrovert, and I'm a lot quieter. But differences are what make
great companies. SGI grew from nothing to a Fortune 500 company.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the strengths of a good company like SGI is that you
have brilliant people who are on the edge,'' McCracken says in a
measured tone. ``That makes the pot more turbulent, and from
turbulence comes brilliance and good ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   McCracken got most of the credit for SGI's success and took most
of the blame for its recent problems.
</P>
<P>
   Embittered by his clash with McCracken, Clark quit as SGI's
chairman in 1994 and sold all his stock in the company.
</P>
<P>
   Several months later, the self-described ``serial entrepreneur''
hooked up with browser whiz-kid Marc Andreessen to start Netscape,
which opened up the Web to the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had the right startup at the right time,'' Clark said.
``The Internet was just taking off, and we blew out the doors with
our timing.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;   &UR;  &LR; Within 18 months of its founding, Netscape went public amid
much hoopla and Clark's stock options were worth more than $1
billion. He currently owns 16 million shares of Netscape stock,
worth more than $570 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jim's genius is looking at the intersection where the
technology is going and where the market will be in several
years,'' Andreessen said. ``On two occasions, &UR;  &LR; he has gone from a
standing start to creating billion-dollar businesses. What's
interesting is how many more companies he has in him.''
</P>
<P>
   While remaining chairman of Netscape, Clark also is the
financial and intellectual force behind Healtheon Corp., which some
observers including Andreessen think could become Clark's third
multibillion-dollar startup.
</P>
<P>
   The Santa Clara company, rumored to be going public in the fall,
makes software that lets consumers manage their health benefits
online. The two-year-old company already has enlisted a long list
of health care providers, hospitals and pharmacies to adopt the
system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Online health care (management) will emerge as one of the
low-hanging fruit industries on the Internet, along with selling
books and PCs,'' said analyst Mary Meeker, of Morgan Stanley in New
York. ``This is a market with huge potential.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark has invested $16 million of his own money &UR;  &LR; in Healtheon,
which is backed by Kleiner Perkins Caufield &AMP; Byers, the same Menlo
Park venture-capital company that helped launch Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I'm the only one to start two or more major companies
nationally,'' Clark said. ``Wayne Huizenga did it (with Waste
Management Systems and Blockbuster Entertainment). I can't think of
anyone else.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Clark's Midas touch has paid off handsomely. He estimates his
personal worth at $500 million to $750 million, give or take a few
million depending on the fortunes of Netscape stock.
</P>
<P>
   Clark also is penning a book, ``Netscape Time,'' which recounts
the launch of the Internet company, and is spending more time with
his family. He has two daughters, ages 33 and 28. He and wife,
Nancy Rudder, a journalist, divide their time between Palm Beach,
Fla., and Atherton, where Clark rents a house from his
grandchildren, ages 2 and 1, who own it.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Healtheon becomes viable, Clark's formidable
energies are shifting to yet another firm: Seascape Communications,
which he houses in a few hundred square feet on top of a Jenny
Craig Weight Loss Center in Menlo Park.
</P>
<P>
   The small software outfit is developing technology for his
latest ``passion'' _ a 156-foot sailboat, dubbed Hyperion, that
could redefine high-tech transportation. When completed in October,
the software program will control the boat's basic functions from a
bank of a dozen onboard computers.
</P>
<P>
   The luxurious boat is chock-full of amenities such as state
rooms, espresso machines, wine storage areas, library and
movie-viewing lounge. Clark said the price tag was in the ``low
eight figures.''
</P>

   ``I love creating companies,'' Clark said as he was noodling
with a software program he created for the boat. ``I come up with
an idea and then I let someone else run them.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, however, he is running late for a helicopter lesson.
``Gotta go,'' he says.

will be a world-class helicopter pilot in no time.

 Sun Microsystems To Cut 200 Jobs In Reorganization   By Julia Angwin  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Sun Microsystems Inc. said yesterday it will cut about 200 jobs _
out of 13,000 in the Bay Area _ as part of a reorganization.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sun's first layoff since 1994 reflects increased pressure from
the Microsoft-Intel juggernaut.
</P>
<P>
   Sun is the only big maker of high-powered workstations and
servers that still uses proprietary technology rather than cheaper
Intel chips and the Microsoft Windows NT operating system.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ``Sun has to be almost superhumanly efficient'' to
maintain its profit margins, said Peter ffoulkes, analyst at
Dataquest in San Jose.
</P>
<P>
   He said the layoffs were a good pre-emptive strike against
possible bloat at the Palo Alto-based firm. Wall Street seemed to
agree, boosting Sun's share price up $1.50 to $44.94 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Sun had hinted at the layoffs in April when it announced it
would reorganize its subsidiaries into seven business units. Sun
said the job cuts were designed to eliminate overlap between the
divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Sun said it notified the 200 employees Tuesday that their jobs
would be cut and gave them 90 days to find employment within the
company.
</P>
<P>
   In other news, Sun agreed yesterday to buy closely-held
corporate software maker NetDynamics Inc. for an undisclosed price.
</P>
<P>
   NetDynamics makes software that gives Internet users access to
information on a corporate database. Companies use it, for example,
to let customers order books or compact discs through the Internet.

IN MAGAZINE PUBLISHING, THE NAME OF THE GAME IS BUZZ 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN POGREBIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ While media critics, talk show hosts and reporters
rehashed the scoop in the first issue of Brill's Content about
Kenneth Starr's leaks in the Monica Lewinsky case, an entirely
different group tipped their hats and took notes: magazine
publicists.
</P>
<P>
   This was buzz of a whole different order, the publicists knew _
buzz that started before the magazine even hit the newsstand and
kept going far into a second week of coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Call the magazine publicists the warrior class of buzz.
Responsible for trying to wrest attention for their publications in
the midst of a media glut, they are proliferating as magazines
devote increasing energy, resources and sophisticated tactics to
promoting themselves _ and only once in a great while does an
article like the one in Brill's do the work for them to that
extent. The result is a kind of incestuous moment in the food chain
of buzz, when one media outlet tries to pitch to another. Buzz _
which has been criticized for encouraging journalistic excess _
enhances circulation and advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of clutter on the newsstand; there's a lot of
clutter in the mail,'' said Efrem Zimbalist III, president and
chief executive of Times Mirror Magazines, which publishes Field
and Stream and Popular Science. ``So we're all looking for ways to
get our names out in front of the public at every opportunity we
can.''
</P>
<P>
   Andrea Kaplan, vice president of corporate communications at
Conde Nast Publications, has four people working for her to promote
magazines like Details, Self and Bride's. Susan Ollinick, director
of public affairs at People magazine, has six people working for
her to publicize People, Teen People and People Espanol. Keith
Estabrook, vice president of communications at Hachette Filipacchi
Magazines, has five people working for him to promote magazines
like Elle, George and Premiere.
</P>
<P>
   In turn, the magazine publicity machine has intensified. In
addition to sending out news releases, planning parties, pitching
story ideas and trying to plant items in gossip columns, publicists
say they are trying to position the publications they represent as
newsmakers and experts on the topics they cover. If a television
program is doing a report on increases in airline ticket prices,
Ms. Kaplan said, she wants that program turning to Conde Nast
Traveler for comment. And if a newspaper is doing an article on
weddings, Ms. Kaplan wants them to turn to Bride's as an authority
on marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fifteen years ago, it was a much more simplistic view of
editorial publicity; you would get the page proofs and you would
promote what's in the magazine,'' Ms. Kaplan said. ``Today it's
much more strategic. It's like the Big Bang theory: We're looking
to every issue every month to get the biggest bang we can for the
magazine out in the marketplace, to have the biggest share in the
mind of the reader and the advertiser.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't go to TV anymore with one idea,'' she said. ``I go
with a five-part series idea, and I go six months in advance.''
</P>
<P>
   Deciding where to go is a crucial part of the process,
publicists say. As Estabrook sees it, there are three kinds of
magazine publicity: industry press, meaning coverage by trade
publications; image-building press, coverage that promotes the aura
of a magazine, not specific content; and what he calls
``bread-and-butter press,'' basics like items in gossip columns.
``And what really makes it work,'' he said, ``is when you have all
three working together cohesively.''
</P>
<P>
   Dan Klores, whose public relations firm represents New York
Magazine and Esquire, among others, said he was careful to focus
his pitches. He will go to television to promote an investigative
or large-scale lifestyle article; to gossip pages with
celebrity-driven items; to news pages with newsworthy articles, and
to trade publications with information about a magazine's increase
in ad pages, personnel moves or changes in design.
</P>
<P>
   ``You identify three to six promotable stories,'' Klores said.
``Then you decide, `Where am I going to go?'''
</P>
<P>
   The good news, publicists say, is that newspapers and television
news programs have grown increasingly dependent on magazines as
sources of content. ``I call it, `Feed the monster,''' said Paul
Wilmot, who was in charge of public relations at Conde Nast for two
years and now has his own firm. ``They have to be filled. ''
</P>
<P>
   To some extent, these interdependent relationships have been
formalized in joint ventures such as Good Housekeeping's
arrangement to have its articles featured on ``Primetime Live'' on
ABC and People's similar deal with ``Dateline'' on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Publicists say they can count on certain tried-and-true motifs:
celebrities who say something newsworthy, magazine surveys,
magazines that rate things _ the 10 best this, the six worst that _
trends, controversy, gossip about job changes or one magazine
stealing another magazine's ideas.
</P>
<P>
   But while magazine items have become a staple of the gossip
columns, Richard Johnson, who writes Page Six in The New York Post,
decried them as ``basically sort of filler.'' He also said he
resented the extent to which publicists try to control the process.
``They try to fine-tune and micromanage their publicity so much
that they will leak different stories to different columns in the
same newspaper in the same day,'' Johnson said. ``I don't know why
I have to be in some pecking order where I get the second- or
third-best thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, some publicists say they are in a position to pick and
choose, like Ms. Ollinick at People, who said she had to sift
through requests from news organizations. ``We always look for a
credible environment,'' she said. ``We never deal with the Hard
Copys and the slugfests _ the talk shows _ except Oprah.''
</P>
<P>
   As to how far a gossip column item can go toward getting a
publicity bounce, Wilmot said: ``A magazine with 1 million
circulation can sell 30,000 to 40,000 copies off a good item:
`Madonna reveals in Harper's Bazaar,' `Sharon Stone admits in
Vogue.'''

 Lucent Plans Bell Labs Unit In Silicon Valley   By Jonathan Marshall  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Bell Laboratories, the research arm of Lucent Technologies, is
opening a new branch in Silicon Valley, in part to foster Lucent's
local venture investments.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The labs will house as many as 130 people at a new facility to
be completed next year in Stanford Research Park and will focus on
data networking, semiconductors, communications software, wireless
communications and optical networking.
</P>
<P>
   It also will supply expertise to Lucent Venture Partners, a $100
million fund the company announced in February to back startups
that complement Lucent's own development efforts. Many major
technology companies, including Microsoft and Intel, have similar
venture arms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bell Labs will help identify and evaluate promising new
technologies,'' said Lucent spokesman Gary Bonham. ``The point
isn't simply to gain an equity position, but to have a hands-on
involvement to move the technology along. We'll give the startups
access to our business units and distribution channels.''
</P>
<P>
   Lucent Venture Partners already has funded at least four new
companies, said John Hanley, its managing partner. He declined to
name the companies or report the level of investment.
</P>
<P>
   But Hanley said the fund is working closely with half a dozen
other venture funds, including Accel Partners in Palo Alto and
Mayfield Fund and U.S. Venture Partners in Menlo Park, to identify
investment candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Fong, a general partner at Mayfield Fund, said Lucent
might use its venture fund to promote commercial development of
technology dreamed up at Bell Labs. And it could further attract
promising startups in the networking industry because Lucent is
widely viewed as a counterweight to networking goliath Cisco
Systems.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent also said yesterday that Lucent Technologies Foundation
will contribute $2.6 million to endow a professorship and two
graduate fellowships at Stanford University to promote research and
teaching on communications networking.
</P>
<P>
   Lucent has made several major acquisitions in the Bay Area
independent of its venture unit. Last year, it bought Octel
Communications, a Milpitas firm that makes unified messaging
software for corporate networks, for $1.8 billion. It also
purchased Livingston Enterprises in Pleasanton, a networking
company, for $650 million in stock. In February, it announced plans
to buy a wireless technology division of Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   The new Bell Labs group will be led by Bill Coughran, head of
Lucent's Internet software research team, and Ron Schmidt, who left
the board of Bay Networks in April. Bay announced last month that
it was being acquired by Northern Telecom, a Lucent competitor in
the telecommunications equipment industry.
</P>
<P>
   For now, the new Bell Labs group will be housed with Lucent
Venture Partners on Sand Hill Road in Menlo Park, before both move
to the Stanford Research Park next year.

 NEW YORK: in Vogue. ' '' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even one short item on a gossip page, publicists say, can be the
spark that ignites other media interest. And publicists are looking
for volume. They measure their successes in ``impressions,'' the
number of times a given issue is mentioned in other media. Among
the widely commended recent public relations successes was Time
Magazine's 75th-anniversary celebration at Radio City Music Hall,
an embarrassment of celebrity riches that juxtaposed the likes of
Henry Kissinger and Sophia Loren, Tom Cruise and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the occasional home run, publicists say their work _
like that of anyone in public relations _ is mostly made up of base
hits and plenty of strikeouts.
</P>
<P>
   Publicists also have to deal with damage control. Yes,
publicists say, there is such a thing as bad publicity. One need
look no further than last week for two examples: Fortune magazine's
scathing profile of Steven Florio, the president and chief
executive of Conde Nast Publications, and Time magazine's
retraction of its article with CNN that asserted the Army used
lethal nerve gas during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   What seems like a public relations nightmare can occasionally
turn into a dream. For example, when Kathie Lee Gifford held up a
copy of Redbook magazine that featured an unflattering article
about her on camera and said, ``Do not buy this magazine,'' sales
went up about 20 percent, according to someone who worked with
Redbook at the time.
</P>
<P>
   And is there such thing as too much buzz? Paradoxically, one
publicist said Brill's Content was just such an example, that so
much hype inspires media figures to get the knives out, as many
have for Steven Brill, the magazine's editor. Some say the same was
true about George magazine, which was widely anticipated when it
first came out in 1995 because of its editor, John Kennedy Jr.
</P>
<P>
   And some say buzz can backfire, as when Esquire magazine put the
actor Kevin Spacey on the cover and implied that he was gay, which
prompted a flurry of negative reaction.
</P>
<P>
   But does imperfection matter? In the June 20 issue of National
Journal, William Powers wrote: ``To cause an uproar, a piece must
have a veneer of fairness, but a tendentious heart. It must be
bold, but not quite realized, and maddeningly flawed. Then people
will talk and argue about it endlessly, flaws being more
interesting than perfection. If you can do all this and also come
up with a chunk of real news, then you'll be a buzz magnet, and
that most precious of commodities _ `impact,' with its promise of
commercial success _ will be yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Publicists say the celebrity of their editors is their best
weapon. Klores pointed to Tina Brown, the editor of The New Yorker,
and Graydon Carter, the editor of Vanity Fair, as prime examples.
``They've taken this to a new level,'' he said. ``The idea that
they themselves have made themselves into people who need to be
invited to functions and `If only I was invited to theirs.' It
makes a lot of the other jobs at those places easier _ it makes ad
sales easier, it's easier to get people to say, `Yes, I'll do that
interview.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although publicists are trying to build subscriptions, newsstand
sales and advertising revenue, they say their first concern is
reaching the media; the rest follows. Media executives say that
press coverage gives magazines the imprimatur of legitimate news,
which impresses potential readers. And when a magazine seems talked
about and written about, publicists say, advertisers respond.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter how effective the public relations effort,
publicists say, ultimately magazines will not rise or fall on
flash. ``I've succeeded when advertising revenues and pages are up
and circulation is up,'' Klores said. ``That's success. PR on its
own cannot do it. You need a great publisher; you need a great ad
sales staff; you need a great editor. You can't do it just by
making news.''

 An Epiphany Brings Former Top KMPG Exec to Silicon Valley   By Tom Abate  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
 
A chauffeur used to drive Roger Siboni from his New Jersey home
each morning to his mid-Manhattan office, where he worked as chief
operating officer of the prestigious KPMG accounting firm.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nowadays Siboni is driving himself around Silicon Valley. Chalk
it up to the fact that at age 43, Siboni reached an Epiphany _
that's the name of the Palo Alto software firm he joins this month
as chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm trading salary and the trappings of power for equity,''
Siboni said.
</P>
<P>
   Epiphany sells a $250,000 software package that can extract
customer information from any database and pour it into a Web
browser. The idea is to let marketing people spot occasional
customers and turn them into big spenders.
</P>
<P>
   Using software to pump up sales is a top priority for
corporations like Charles Schwab Corp., which has been using
Epiphany since November.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing on the market that I'm aware of that is as
powerful and as easy to use, and is also Web-accessible,'' said
Mary Kelley, vice president for database marketing at Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Credit for making Epiphany powerful  &LR; and &LR;  simple goes to
co-founders Ben Wegbreit and Steve Blank, and lead programmers Greg
Walsh and John McCaskey.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's up to Siboni to sell this startup to the Fortune 500 by
drawing on personal relationships built up during two decades as a
high-profile KPMG consultant.
</P>
<P>
   Siboni is no stranger to the Valley. He started KPMG's high-tech
consulting practice in 1975, advising ancient firms such as
WordStar.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, while COO at KPMG, Siboni took sides in the ``browser
wars'' when he handed a huge contract to Microsoft despite a
personal sales pitch from Netscape CEO Jim Barksdale.
</P>
<P>
   Over lunch in Palo Alto, Siboni said he's run into Barksdale
since then, and their cordial exchange convinced him that the
Netscape CEO hasn't held a grudge.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Barksdale's such a big man, he probably doesn't mind
that Epiphany just hired Karen Richardson as its vice president of
sales, luring her away from a similar post at Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   After all, it's only business in the fast lane.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; Conspicuous absence: &LR;  House Speaker Newt Gingrich led a
delegation of congressional Republicans on a meet-and-greet tour of
Silicon Valley &UR;  &LR; this week, but local Representative Tom Campbell,
R.-Campbell, was not a member of his party.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be the hometowner was snubbed because he was on the
losing side of last summer's attempted Republican coup against the
Speaker? Whatever the cause, Campbell finds himself temporarily
frozen out of the GOP's effort to make sure Vice President Al Gore
doesn't walk away with Silicon Valley votes _ or money.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to pay more attention here, and ask in return for more
attention to be paid to us,'' said Representative Bob Goodlatte,
R-Va., who accompanied Gingrich.
</P>
<P>
   Goodlatte, who has spearheaded encryption legislation favored by
high-tech firms, was tapped by Gingrich to head a new Technology
Leadership Group that will bring Republicans in Congress together
with industry leaders like Cisco Vice President Judy Estrin,
Merrill Lynch investment banker Scott Ryles and Kleiner, Perkins
venture capitalist Floyd Kvamme.
</P>
<P>
   _ &UR; AOL's slippery slope? &LR;  Last week America Online shut down the
Web site of a member who had parodied several passages from the
Koran.
</P>
<P>
   The shut down was publicized by the Freedom Forum, a Virginia
foundation dedicated to newspaper and First Amendment issues. The
Forum said the site drew strong objections from Muslim academics in
Egypt and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley-based AOL watcher Dave Cassel said members at large
hardly noticed the flap. But Cassel questioned AOL's censorship
policy in light of the fact that a Texas Ku Klux Klan chapter has a
long-standing AOL page that advises visitors to prepare ``for the
coming disorder that will test the very survival of the White race
... (against the) jack booted Zionist Occupational Government.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said her firm received more than
1,000 complaints about the Koran site, and closed it after decided
it ``defamed a religious group.''
</P>
<P>
   She said AOL had received some complaints last year about the
KKK site last year, and AOL requested some changes to the page at
that time. But this year AOL has not heard any objections from
members and therefore has not taken any action against the page.
</P>
<P>
   The page is maintained by the Klan group that marched in Jasper,
Texas, last week, the town where a black man was killed by being
dragged behind a truck allegedly driven by several white men.

 Packard Bell NEC Names Groupe Bull Exec as CEO   By Jamie Beckett  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Packard Bell NEC moved quickly yesterday to name Alain Couder
president and CEO following the abrupt resignation of its founder.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Couder, a top executive of Groupe Bull, a major stakeholder in
Packard Bell NEC, replaces Beny Alagem, 45, who decided to leave
the PC maker Tuesday because of ``fundamental differences'' with
its shareholders, Groupe Bull and NEC.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Couder said Alagem had not resigned under pressure from the
company's board of directors, but he wouldn't say more. Analysts
speculated that Alagem was ousted because he was unable to stem
losses, and one analyst said that health problems prompted Alagem
to leave. Alagem would not elaborate on his prepared statement.
</P>
<P>
   Couder, 52, is chief operating officer at Groupe Bull, a French
hardware and software-maker that owns 13 percent of
Sacramento-based Packard Bell NEC. NEC Corp. of Japan owns 49
percent of Packard Bell.
</P>
<P>
   The executive change comes as the company, known for its
low-cost personal computers, is trying to shore up its slipping
market share against rivals Dell, Compaq and Hewlett-Packard.
</P>
<P>
   In May, the privately held company cut 400 jobs nationwide to
pare costs. Although company officials did not disclose figures,
they said Packard Bell has been losing money for ``a couple of
years.''
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide, the market share of Packard Bell, the world's
fifth-largest PC-maker, has fallen to 4.8 percent from 7.6 percent
in 1995, according to Dataquest, a research firm.
</P>
<P>
   The company sells Packard Bell consumer PCs at retail stores and
NEC business PCs primarily through distributors and direct mail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  There was some confusion about when the new CEO will start
work. Couder, a French citizen who now lives in Paris, said he will
assume the role of president and chief executive of Packard Bell
NEC as soon as his visa is issued.
</P>
<P>
   But board members, who also appointed Couder to chair the
executive committee of the board, said in a statement they expect
Couder to start work by October 1, at the latest. The board did not
say who would run the company in the interim.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; ``One goal is to be profitable,'' Couder told reporters and
analysts during a conference call. Speaking in a heavy French
accent, he declined to be specific about his plans or when he
expected to get the company into the black.
</P>
<P>
   He said he wants Packard Bell to be able to provide consulting
services along with its PC sales _ as its competitors do. He would
not discuss how he plans to build the services business, other than
to say he plans no acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Couder also was unable to say when an initial public offering _
planned for later this year _ would occur.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Couder's operational experience at Groupe Bull,
which sells to business customers, could help Packard Bell as it
shifts its emphasis to the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   But they worried about his ability to build a vision for the
company. For example, other PC companies, such as Apple Computer

   ``Where is the spark, the excitement for Packard Bell NEC going
forward?'' asked Bill Schaub, a PC analyst at Dataquest in San
Jose.
</P>
<P>
   Alagem and his co-founders remain shareholders of Packard Bell
and currently own 25 percent. He will have no management role in
the company.
</P>
<P>
   Packard Bell was founded in 1986, when Alagem and two partners
bought rights to the name from Teledyne Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Alagem was given a chance by NEC and Groupe Bull to stay on as
chairman but declined. ``I decided I'd be happier in my own
venture,'' Alagem said in a statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The company has not named a new chairman.

   ASIA-TRAVEL _ WASHINGTON _ Once an out-of-reach destination for

Tumbling currencies due to Asia's economic woes have resulted in
deep discounts on airfares, hotel rooms and package tours. With
intra-Asian travel at a near halt, airlines and tour operators are

at Mexico's beautiful Quintana Roo coastline _ called Xcacel and
considered one of most important turtle nesting grounds in the
Caribbean _ to protect endangered turtles and their eggs from
poachers. But soon, they fear, their work will be obliterated. The
state government has quietly sold much of Xcacel to resort hotel
developers, despite a covenant that was signed to protect it and
years of effort to have it declared a federal reserve. Soon, the
turtles could be greeted by as many as 1,500 hotel rooms jammed
onto the small beach, producing glaring lights that would drive the
turtles away. (Ferriss, Cox News Service). MOVED. WITH PHOTOS.

STATE PUPILS RANK BELOW U.S. AVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   By NANETTE ASIMOV and LORI OLSZEWSKI  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Most of California's English-speaking students
scored below the national average on the state's controversial new
achievement test, according to results released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In most grades, reading and math levels lagged behind the
national average. Scores were especially poor in spelling and high
school science.
</P>
<P>
   One bright spot was language skills _ such as vocabulary and
grammar _ where most grades performed above the national average.
</P>
<P>
   The new test sits at the center of California's politically
charged bilingual education debate. Because of a legal battle over
whether non-English speakers should have to take the test in
English, the state did not release scores from schools and
districts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it posted only the percentage of students in each grade
who scored above the 25th, 50th and 75th percentile on the 99-point
multiple-choice test. A score of 50 represents the national
average.
</P>
<P>
   At a time of heightened concern about the quality of California
schools, the test showed plenty of reasons to worry:
</P>
<P>
   -- In reading, performance dropped off significantly by high
school, with ninth- and 10th-graders scoring far below the national
average, then improving only slightly by 11th grade.
</P>
<P>
   -- In math, students generally performed at or just below the
national average. Only 10th-graders scored far lower.
</P>
<P>
   -- In spelling, a subject that for years has been neglected in
California schools, students demonstrated a particular need to
study their ABCs. Only fifth-graders and seventh-graders came even
close to performing at the national average in this basic area.
</P>
<P>
   -- Only high school students were tested in science and social
studies. Social studies numbers were below the national average,
and results were particularly poor in science.
</P>
<P>
   -- In language, students in almost every grade scored somewhere
around the national average. Only 10th-graders scored far below
average.
</P>
<P>
   In the first measure of student performance in four years, 4.1
million children in grades 2 through 11 took the Standardized
Testing and Reporting (STAR) exam this spring. About a quarter of
them spoke little or no English, but were required to take the test
in English under California's controversial new testing law, backed
by Gov. Pete Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   The makers of the test calculated the national averages by means
of a statistical survey of children who were nearly all English
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   The Oakland and Berkeley school districts sued to block the
release of non-English speakers' scores. Last week, a judge blocked
the state's plans to publish district-by-district results. Tuesday,
an appeals court upheld that decision, pending a July 16 hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the state offered Tuesday the averages of
English-speaking students only _ while districts, not bound by the
court ruling, dispensed crazy-quilt numbers of their own. Some
released the English-only results, some handed out all the figures,
and some declined to disclose anything.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the state numbers only fueled a bitter debate between
Wilson and Superintendent Delaine Eastin, who is running for
re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Eastin called the results ``pretty good.'' Referring to
California's last-place showing four years ago on a national exam,
Eastin said: ``At least we're not standing in the deepest hole.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wilson took a far less charitable view of the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're deplorable,'' he said, discounting the value of any
scores just under 50, the national average. ``We've been seriously
short-changing California children in the quality of their
education.''
</P>
<P>
   Eastin pledged to focus attention on science, and she chastised
state lawmakers for turning down her bid last year to include
laboratory science in high school graduation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Legislature turned us down flat,'' she said. ``And members
of both parties whined about how expensive it would be to build
science labs. But this state is the home of the biotech industry,
and we need to strengthen our science requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the state Board of Education is in the process of
choosing new science standards, Eastin said they will mean little
unless such courses are required for graduation.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson said he favors holding students back a grade if they do
not satisfy academic requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Most districts had released their scores by Tuesday, but many
San Francisco Bay Area school systems would not, including San
Francisco, Oakland, Hayward, West Contra Costa, San Jose and
Ravenswood City in East Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley also opted to withhold its scores _ but only after
giving them out in advance of the court order.
</P>
<P>
   Overall scores in Berkeley hovered above the national average in
every subject but spelling. In general, its scores were also better
than the state's _ even though Berkeley's included those of
non-English-speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the relatively good showing, Berkeley Superintendent
Jack McLaughlin objected to releasing the results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The figures . . . give an unfair snapshot of a child's, a
school's and a district's performance,'' said McLaughlin, summing
up the objections many educators have about testing children in a
language they do not understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``People reading this information are not going to come back in
a month or two months to compare figures. They are going to look at
this information today and say, `That isn't a good school.' Worse,
they will say, `Those (limited-English-speaking) students are
pretty dumb.' That's a horrific label to carry with you when you're
only 7 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Alameda County, Piedmont Unified posted scores that
were far above average _ even in spelling.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Piedmont students outperformed more than 80 percent of
test-takers around the country. Nevertheless, even Piedmont
spellers did flag slightly, scoring generally within the 70th
percentile.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Piedmont scores are good, Patrick Gemma, an
assistant superintendent, said he supports the position that
non-English speakers should not have been tested and included in
the results.
</P>
<P>
   On the Peninsula, children in the well-to-do Portola Valley
schools also posted sky-high scores _ generally outscoring 80 to 90
percent of other children nationwide in reading and math.
</P>
<P>
   In Santa Rosa, school officials separated the results of
students who speak the language from those who do not. The
difference is vast.
</P>
<P>
   The average reading score of an 11th-grader who grew up speaking
English is 57. But for a student in the same grade who speaks
little English, the average score is only 9.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The companies backing DVD, the CD-size digital disc
that contains a feature-length movie, are boasting a lot these
days, telling anyone who will listen that their product is selling
faster than either compact-disc players or VCRs did at the
corresponding points after they were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   By late June, a little more than a year after the introduction
of DVDs, manufacturers had sold nearly 600,000 DVD players. By
comparison, in March 1985, 16 months after the compact disc was
introduced, only 320,000 players had been sold. For VCRs in
September 1979, the number was 515,000.
</P>
<P>
   As pleased as equipment makers and Hollywood studio executives
are, some acknowledge that in some ways the achievement is hollow
because DVD is in a race for its survival, sprinting to gain a
significant foothold in American homes ahead of two headstrong
rivals. The odds of success are uncertain at best.
</P>
<P>
   One of the competitors is Divx, an upstart hybrid DVD format
that went on sale last month in two test markets, Richmond, Va.,
and San Francisco. A full-scale national introduction is scheduled
for September.
</P>
<P>
   But the other more important adversary is digital cable
television, which is expected to make picture-perfect, digital,
pay-per-view movies a ubiquitous feature in American homes within a
few years, said Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video,
the largest distributor of DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a horse race, not just against Divx, but
against AT&AMP;T and TCI, against Comcast cable _ and the whole
migration to digital pay per view,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp. agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc.,
the United States' second-largest cable company, for $31.8 billion.
One goal of the merged company is to bring pay-per-view movies on
demand to millions of homes. Comcast Corp. and other cable
companies have similar plans, as do some broadcasters, after
digital broadcasting begins in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Liebfarb fears that movies on demand will short-circuit the sale
of movies on discs. Why buy a DVD when you can dial up the same
movie on your television set whenever you want? The medium will
fail, he says, unless DVD is already an entrenched part of family
life, as VCRs are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have three years,'' he said. ``Three years from now
we need to be in 10 million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order, given that the industry has sold only
578,604 DVD players in the last 15 months, according to the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association. Initial industry
projections were that 800,000 DVD players would sell in the first
year.
</P>
<P>
   DVD originally stood for digital videodisc. But that name was
abandoned when the designers realized that the discs could be used
for computer files and audio recordings, too, offering seven times
the storage capacity of CD-ROMs and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the format is simply known as DVD. Though DVDs offer
high-resolution pictures and digital surround-sound, the format
faces its own daunting challenge: most Americans still know nothing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the Video Software Dealers Association,
which backs the format, found that 62 percent of those surveyed in
May had never heard of DVD. The study did find some improvement; in
a similar survey a year ago, the number was 81 percent. In the
latest survey, Yankelovich Partners interviewed 1,938 people, all
of whom were at least 18 and owned a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally I think it shows that we are seeing an uptick in
consumer awareness,'' said Jeffrey Eves, association president.
</P>
<P>
   But Eves, Lieberfarb and many others worry that Divx (pronounced
DIV-ix) may stand in the way of further progress.
</P>
<P>
   Divx, a technology backed by the Circuit City chain of
electronics stores and a Los Angeles law firm, originally stood for
digital video express. But like DVD, the acronym has become the
name.
</P>
<P>
   Divx discs are DVDs with coding that allows them to be played
only once and only in special players. Zenith Corp. is making the
first player, which accommodates both Divx discs and regular DVDs
and sells for $499 _ a little more than the lowest-priced DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Each Divx disc costs $4.49, compared with about $25 for a DVD.
But if a viewer plays the Divx disc after an initial two-day
viewing period, the owner will be charged about $3. The accounting
is done by the Divx central computer, which is connected to the
Divx player by a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   When Circuit City announced the Divx concept last fall, it was
greeted with howls of vitriol from DVD supporters who complained
that the new format would confuse consumers and threaten the
success of DVD. Lieberfarb was among the most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints were so loud that some in the industry predicted
that Divx would never get off the ground _ especially because
Warner Bros. and a few other studios, including Columbia Tri-Star,
have refused to issue movies in the Divx format, fearing it would
undermine the success of DVD.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 7, Divx discs and players went on sale in 45 Circuit
City and Good Guys stores in Richmond and San Francisco. Circuit
City also began advertising Divx on television and in newspapers in
both places.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Home Video countered with a program to encourage video
stores in those two cities and three others to rent DVDs and DVD
players. The Yankelovich survey showed that most people wanted to
be able to rent DVDs just as they do videotapes. But video dealers
have been slow to stock the discs because few people own DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Divx and Warner sales programs are so new that neither
company is ready to release results, though Richard Sharp, chief
executive of Circuit City Stores Inc., dismissively said: ``We've
been in some of their stores, and they are offering only about 40
titles'' for rent.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp is able to do little better. As of Wednesday, only 45
movies were available in the Divx format. Sharp predicts the total
will be 400 by the end of the year. By comparison, 1,400 movies
were available on DVD on July 1; 180 of those were issued in June
alone.
</P>
<P>
   When Divx players go on sale nationally this fall, Circuit City
plans to begin a $100 million advertising campaign. Warner,
meanwhile, says it will offer its DVD rental program nationally in
the fall as well, though Lieberfarb said Warner and allied
companies would spend considerably less than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Divx, like DVD, must gain a foothold before
pay-per-view services proliferate. Sharp agrees but says he has
five years before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp predicts that Divx will succeed because the concept offers
several advantages that his research indicates consumers
appreciate. Chief among them is that for about the cost of renting
a videotape, a Divx buyer can take a disc home and keep it,
eliminating return trips to the video store and late fees.
</P>
<P>
   But those two attributes have turned out to be liabilities as
well. The nation's video-rental dealers hate Divx. ``It undermines
the entire business'' by reducing traffic in the stores, Eves said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no video store has agreed to sell Divx discs. They
can be bought only at at Circuit City and Good Guys stores and the
Divx site on the Internet at www.divx.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a kind of chicken-and-egg problem,'' Sharp said.
``In time, I think the power of the Divx format will overpower
this.''

BRITISH TROOPS BLOCK PROTESTANT MARCH IN NORTHERN IRELAND 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ The British government used
hundreds of combat-ready army troops and Northern Ireland policemen
Sunday to prevent several thousand Protestants from marching, as
Protestants have since 1807, through a small Roman Catholic enclave
in this town.
</P>
<P>
   The government acted to prevent clashes between the Catholic
minority and the Protestant majority in this predominantly
Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, members of the patriotic Orange Order wearing
black suits and orange sashes, dispersed after one of their leaders
walked up to a huge concrete roadblock and spoke a message of
protest through a high chain fence, blocking the road to the
Catholic area. But there was no one on the other side to listen,
and no violence followed.
</P>
<P>
   The government feared that the annual march might lead to
rioting and vandalism, as it did in the last three years.
Widespread violence could endanger the recently approved peace
agreement, which spells out drastic political reforms that will
give Catholics more power in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The government was clearly gambling that this year would be
different, that Protestants, many of whom voted for the peace
agreement in a referendum in May, would be less angry at Catholics
and the government now than in 1996. Then, a government ban on the
march through the Drumcree enclave was announced several days
beforehand, but the decision was reversed because Protestant
rioters wreaked millions of dollars of property damage. The
Protestant violence and the decision to let them march provoked
retaliation by Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the British official in charge of Northern Ireland,
Mo Mowlam, agreed and allowed the march after police forcibly
lifted protesting Catholics, often roughly, from the road. But this
year, approving the ban, she said that the rights of the
Protestants and Catholics had to be balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 200 marchers remained quietly on the side of a hill
between the Church of Ireland church at Drumcree, where they had
attended an annual service. The Orangemen, and a few women, looked
across a small stream, its banks scooped steeper by British
diggers, at several rows of four-foot-high barbed wire coils and
armed security forces. Many said it looked like a battlefield from
a World War II movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only God will save us,'' said the Rev. John Pickering, who
spoke to the church's congregation before it left to confront
British officials. But no officials, not even a soldier or a
policeman, were at the roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total disgrace,'' said Harold Gracey, head of the
local Orange Order. ``We'll stay here until we are allowed our
legitimate right to walk on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after he spoke, most Orangemen had left the area, but
some set up a British Union Jack and a white Ulster flag on the
side of the stream, facing the security forces about 500 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   Two men not wearing Orange Order regalia were arrested after
they made a brief attempt to cross the barbed wire. Several tents
were put up by people who said they intended to stay all night.
</P>
<P>
   By evening, there were no reports of violence in the province.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Catholics in Drumcree, Breandan MacCionnaith,
urged Catholics to be wary of Protestants trying to sneak through
the British lines to demonstrate. His warning seemed intended to
keep the issue alive politically, as the area is ringed with
troops, policemen, armored Land Rovers and Saxon military troop
carriers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The all-male Protestant Orange Order says that marching is a
matter of freedom of assembly, a basic democratic right. Generally,
the 3,000 Protestant parades held each summer celebrate the victory
at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, of the Protestant William of
Orange over his father-in-law, King James II. The victory
established the Protestant Ascendancy, and British rule in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics feel that the marches, only a handful of which are
contentious, are offensive and triumphalist as the Orangemen strut
stiffly by to the martial music of loud drums. Only one group, the
Edgarstown Drum and Accordion Band, marched up to the roadblock
Sunday, thumping and wheezing its martial airs through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the marchers Sunday milled around, chatting, even
smiling, looking at the gray sky threatening rain, seeing a single
police helicopter hovering at about 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   One angry man explained why Orangemen refused to negotiate with
Mr. MacConnaith, the Catholic leader, identifying him as ``the one
who blew up the Legion Hall in Thomas Street.'' MacCionnaith served
time in a British prison as an Irish Republican Army operative
convicted for his role in the destruction of the British social
club hall in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent Sunday was David Trimble, an Orangeman and leader
of the Ulster Unionist Party, who was chosen last Wednesday as
First Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, the engine of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, now committed to trying to cooperate with Catholics in
political reforms, was a star of the 1995 Drumcree march when he
raised his arm in triumph after walking past the Catholic homes.

CAL STATE SCUTTLES TECHNOLOGY FINANCE PLAN
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By LAURIE FLYNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   California State University, the United States' largest college
system, has scuttled a much-disputed plan to accept a $300 million
investment from a group of high-technology companies to upgrade the
university's networks and other technology infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, known as CETI, for California Educational
Technology Initiative, was officially canceled last week when GTE,
the lead company in the proposed partnership, announced that it
would not participate, because it could not reach agreement with
the university on the financial terms of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had difficulty developing a plan that would allow the
project to pay for itself,'' said GTE spokesman Larry Cox.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Microsoft Corp. and Hughes Electronics, a unit of
General Motors, said they were pulling out of CETI for similar
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A Microsoft executive said that on closer evaluation, the
company had decided that the debt burden was simply too large and
the risk too high.
</P>
<P>
   Cancellation of the deal also ended the participation of the
fourth partner, Fujitsu America. In exchange for their investments,
the four companies had been promised revenue opportunities from
services and products like software and pager accounts sold to
students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The CETI plan had been intensely debated since it was announced
last fall. Top university officials consistently praised the
proposal, but some students and staff members attacked it as
anti-competitive and called the notion of a private investment a
threat to the principles of public higher education.
</P>
<P>
   Some criticism focused on Microsoft's role in the consortium,
given the Justice Department's antitrust suit against the software
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics said that handing over the university's entire
computing business to a private entity could turn the campuses into
training grounds for certain products, promoting, for example, the
use of personal computers running Microsoft Windows over Apple
Computer's Macintosh, or giving Microsoft's Explorer Internet
browser dominance over the Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, student groups held rallies on several campuses, with
some saying that the plan would lead to ``Microsoft University,''
and in January the California Legislature held a special hearing on
CETI. Throughout this time, CETI representatives said its critics
were misinformed about how the consortium would work, and argued
that the plan was a reasonable solution for the financially
troubled educational system.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Charles Reed said that the university had adequately
addressed all the critics' concerns and that the only remaining
stumbling block was financial. ``This fear that somehow private
industry would take over intellectual property was just
unfounded,'' said Reed, chancellor of the 23-campus system since
March. ``They didn't care one bit. Their only concern was their
profits.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, the university, which serves nearly 330,000 students,
is facing a deficit of $70 million to $100 million in its
technology program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's back to the drawing board, with five or six different
options to consider,'' Reed said.
</P>
<P>
   The university system, the chancellor said, would continue to
try to forge partnerships with private companies. At the same time,
he said, the university would consider a bond issue or, possibly,
raising student fees in direct exchange for technology services to
help finance the sorely needed technology upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Reed said he planned to have a new proposal to present to the
university's trustees in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd still like to see if I could do some public-private
deals,'' he said. ``That's the future.''

 &HT;    NAACP convention to open amid bright financial outlook, high
morale
 &HT;    By Raven Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Four years ago the nation's oldest civil rights
organization faced a bleak future.
</P>
<P>
   The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People
was $4.8 million in debt and in the midst of a leadership crisis.
Critics questioned the organization's relevancy and morale among
members was low.
</P>
<P>
   As it prepares for its national convention in Atlanta Saturday _
the first time the organization has met here in 36 years _ the
NAACP's financial outlook is decidedly brighter. Morale has
returned and its leadership has begun to restore the organization's
luster. Perhaps its biggest accomplishment is a $2 million budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   ``The leadership of Myrlie Evers Williams did it,'' said Julian
Bond, who replaced Williams as board chairman six months ago. ``She
brought Kweisi Mfume to the president's job, and that combination
of leadership turned the organization around.''
</P>
<P>
   The convention, themed ``Preparing Tomorrow's Leaders Today,''
run-- through July 16 at the Georgia World Congress Center.
Speakers include Vice President Al Gore, Gen. Colin Powell, Ted
Turner and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. More than 6,000 people are
expected to attend. Planned events include an anti-violence march
and rally, a job fair, concerts and workshops. Most events are open
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   A special gospel concert featuring a 200-voice community choir
will be held on Saturday in honor of Jondelle Johnson, the longtime
executive director of the Atlanta NAACP branch who died in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel she'll be in the big NAACP office in the sky listening
in on Saturday,'' said R.L. White, president of the Atlanta branch.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP decided to return to Atlanta because it is now
considered a mecca for blacks, many of whom work in corporations
like Coca Cola, Delta Airlines and NationsBank, which are helping
to sponsor the convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last time the convention was here there were segregation
signs _ 'whites only,' 'blacks only' water fountains and things,''
said Jesse Hill Jr., former president of Atlanta Life Insurance who
sought corporate support for the convention. ``Given the leadership
of Atlanta, we expected (segregationist laws) to change much
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Bond, a former Georgia state senator, said the annual convention
is a chance for members to rededicate themselves to tackling issues
that impact minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The convention is a gathering of the NAACP family,'' Bond
said. ``It allows for an exchange of ideas and to hear new ways of
attacking old problems.''

but Kansas City's Hal Morris is third in the league with a .348
average.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big arms: In a recent at-bat between Cleveland pitcher
Bartolo Colon and Rick Guttierez, the Astros shortstop struck out
on the 20th pitch thrown to him. That's right, Guttierez fouled off
14 pitches.

homers, that is halfway to the major league record which was set by
Bert Blyleven with the Twins in 1986.

   _ The injuries: The White Sox place closer Matt Karchner on the
disabled list with a strained left abductor muscle.

into first with the Angels struggling.

interleague homers in the majors with 10. He also homered in four
straight games last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The big arms: Anaheim's Chuck Finley has the best ERA in the

SHAREHOLDER REACTION RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT AT&AMP;T-TCI DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By GERALDINE FABRIKANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T Corp. have fallen 16 percent since its planned
acquisition of Tele-Communications Inc. for $31.8 billion in stock
was announced last month, leading some to speculate that the deal
may have to be renegotiated in light of the poor shareholder
reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of AT&AMP;T closed Thursday at $54.875, a 52-week low, down
from $65.375 on June 23, the day before the acquisition was
formally announced. The drop is leading many on Wall Street to
wonder if it is a good wedding for the two companies.
</P>
<P>
   The president of Tele-Communications, Leo Hindery Jr., was
quoted in The Los Angeles Times on Friday as acknowledging that the
companies might have to renegotiate the deal in light of the poor
shareholder reaction.
</P>
<P>
   Hindery could not be reached for comment Sunday. However,
another person involved in the talks said that there were no plans
at this time to renegotiate terms of the deal and that it would be
``ridiculous'' to think of renegotiating so soon after the deal had
been announced, and before its implications could be absorbed by
Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, which is based in Basking Ridge, N.J., has not yet filed
complete details of the acquisition of Tele-Communications with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, after some recent mergers have been announced,
shares of both the acquiring companies and the acquired companies
have risen. For example, the stock prices of both Travelers Group
and Citicorp were up for weeks after their merger was announced in
April.
</P>
<P>
   And another person acquainted with both the chief executive of
AT&AMP;T, C. Michael Armstrong, and John Malone, chairman of
Tele-Communications, said the two remained heavily committed to the
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Both men are expected to speak at this week's annual summer
conference of media executives held by Allen &AMP; Co. in Sun Valley,
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T has said that it will have to pay a $1.75 billion fee if it
fails to win shareholder and regulator approval for the
acquisition. This is about the same amount Worldcom Inc. would have
to pay MCI Communications Corp. if that acquisition fails to take
place.
</P>
<P>
   The breakup fee represents roughly $3 a share to
Tele-Communication's shareholders. An investment banker who
declined to be quoted said, ``Investors tend to see breakup fees as
one-time payments regardless of size,'' and he added that even if
there is some opposition to the AT&AMP;T-TCI deal, it is sometimes
difficult to rally the necessary majority to block a major merger.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T did negotiate a ``collar'' for the deal, meaning that
regardless of how much AT&AMP;T stock falls, the telecommunications
giant will not have to guarantee Tele-Communications any additional
cash or stock per share.
</P>
<P>
   Under terms of the acquisition, AT&AMP;T will also assume TCI's debt
of about $11 billion. The $31.8 billion purchase price also does
not include $5.5 billion in cash AT&AMP;T will pay to repurchase shares
that AT&AMP;T issued to TCI in a previous transaction and to acquire
its interest in a cable-modem venture that delivers high-speed
Internet data over television cables. But in announcing the deal,
the companies added these amounts to their calculation of the
value, for a total of $48.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Combining AT&AMP;T's financial muscle and nation-spanning
communications network with Tele-Communications' wires into
millions of homes would create a communications behemoth with a
reach unrivaled since AT&AMP;T spun off its local phone operations in
1984 in an antitrust settlement with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   If investors remain extremely skeptical about the price of the
deal, it is in large part because of the high cost associated with
upgrading cable's one-way video to a two-way delivery system that
can deliver voice and data as well as video.

 &HT;    Aaron recalls Home Run Derby of old
 &HT;    By I.J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ Years ago before there was a home run hitting contest
at the All-Star Game, there was a televised program called ``Home
Run Derby.'' It was the prelude to what fans will watch tonight,
when the best power hitters in baseball slug it out at Coors Field.
</P>
<P>
   ``'Home Run Derby' was a blast,'' said Hank Aaron, the show's
top money-winner. ``I had fun, but the real reason I did it was
because of the money. Back then that was good money for me, and I
took the money I won and bought a grocery store for my father.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a rather simple format. Two hitters would get three outs
per inning and play nine innings. Anything that didn't go over the
fence was an out. A called strike by the umpire was an out. The
player with the most home runs after nine innings received the
winner's total of $2,000. The loser got $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   A player who hit three homers in a row got a bonus of $500 and
another $500 for four straight.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was empty Wrigley Field in south-central Los
Angeles, where minor league teams, owned by the same chewing gum
tycoon from Chicago, had played for years. It was 339 feet down the
left- and right-field lines. The power alleys were 345.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great for me, because I pulled a lot of balls to
left,'' Aaron said.
</P>
<P>
   The television shows were taped after the 1959 season, and some
of the greatest hitters of all-time participated. The first matchup
was between Mickey Mantle and Willie Mays. Mantle beat Mays with a
home run in the bottom of the ninth to win 9-8.
</P>
<P>
   But Aaron enjoyed the most success during his four days of
competition.
</P>
<P>
   He beat Ken Boyer 9-6, Jim Lemon 6-4, Eddie Mathews 4-3, Al
Kaline 5-1, Duke Snider 3-1 and Bob Allison 3-2. He finally was
beaten by Wally Post 7-4, but Aaron made $13,500.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I was going to have to be good, because I would have
one shot,'' Aaron said. ``The one thing I remember the most is
beating my teammate, Mathews. I remember hating facing him. I think
we were the only teammates to face each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Aaron beat Mathews with a two-out homer in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The show was broadcasted in 1960. Mark Scott, the announcer and
creator, died of a heart attack. The tapes then sat on a shelf at
the MGM studios for more than 25 years before ESPN bought the
rights in 1988. They sometimes are shown on the Classic Sports
Network.
</P>
<P>
   It was the only time Aaron ever participated in such a contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a few of them during the season, and I didn't
participate in them because they messed up my swing,'' he said. ``I
never thought home runs were all that exciting. I still think the
triple is the most exciting thing in baseball. To me, a triple is
like a guy taking the ball on his 1-yard line and running 99 yards
for a touchdown. Don't get me wrong; home runs are important. They
win a lot of games. But I never understood, and still don't
understand, why fans are so obsessed with them. I think watching a
guy hit a ball over the fence and trot around the bases is actually
pretty boring.''

 &HT;    Last play of game becomes a sideshow in Braves-Mets contest
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ New York catcher Mike Piazza says he didn't bobble the
throw. Manager Bobby Valentine accused Atlanta's Michael Tucker of
a dirty and illegal slide and reliever John Franco claims home
plate umpire Angel Hernandez still doesn't know what exactly
happened.
</P>
<P>
   This much is crystal clear: New York's blueprint for catching
the Braves in the National League East _ pulling within five games
before slugger Todd Hundley's return from the disabled list later
this month _ must be reconditioned.
</P>
<P>
   As the Mets head into the All-Star break, they find themselves
trailing the Braves by 12 1/2 games after Atlanta's three-game
sweep this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   And the final play in Sunday's 3-2 loss _ Walt Weiss' sacrifice
fly that scored Tucker from third for the winning run in the 11th
inning _ was an opportunity for some Mets to vent their
frustration.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I know is I've got more wound marks on my catcher,''
Valentine said. ``(Piazza) has got spike marks that are five inches
deep. I've got a wounded catcher and another loss. It's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't believe it,'' said Piazza, who says he won't
require stitches in his right thigh. ``I looked over at their bench
and they were jumping up and down. I didn't know what the hell was
going on because I had the ball. I thought he was out and I was
ready to go to the next inning. That's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Weiss' liner off Franco was caught by left fielder Bernard
Gilkey, whose one-hop throw to Piazza beat Tucker to the plate.
Valentine claims Tucker slid with his leg high, so Tucker could
have never touched home plate. ``(Tucker) hasn't hit the ground
yet,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   After Hernandez called Tucker safe, though, Valentine says he
believed Piazza dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Mike dropped the ball. The ball beat him easily and
the guy jumped into Mike's lap,'' Valentine said. ``(Hernandez)
said he slid under the tag.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco claims Hernandez offered conflicting events.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first, (Hernandez) said he dropped the ball,'' Franco said.
``Then he said his leg got under. He doesn't even know.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco and Valentine immediately swarmed Hernandez, and umpire
crew chief Randy Marsh said both Mets made contact with Hernandez.
Valentine and Franco could face suspensions and possibly fines from
NL president Leonard Coleman.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Marsh) had better look at the (expletive) film,'' Valentine
said. ``I never touched him. If there was any contact out there, it
was because they were trying to walk off the field. ... It was
really hard to appeal it to third base. That (umpire) was already
in the dressing room.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Marsh offered the only interpretation that really
matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there was a bobble there,'' Marsh said. ``But
looking at the tape, it looked like Piazza bent over trying to
smother it. But the bottom line was (Tucker) got his foot down in
there, before (Piazza) was even doing that, before he put the tag
on him.''

   MARNE-LA-VALLEE, France _ Mickey Mouse has been on the picket
lines here at Disneyland Paris for almost two weeks. Captain Hook
wants more money, and so does Pluto, who says he loves his work but
hardly has a bone to gnaw on come the end of the month.
</P>
<P>
   You couldn't hope to find a more wholesome-looking group of
French labor militants, all with Disneyland regulation haircuts and
cheerfully greeting French, German, Belgian and Italian visitors on
their way in for an afternoon of entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love working here,'' said Arnaud M., a 26-year-old Parisian
who wears a Pluto costume in the daily parades down Main Street USA
when he's working, but was as reluctant to say so as he was to see
his last name published in a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to spoil the illusion for the kids,'' he said as
he and about 50 fellow strikers, some wearing prisoner costumes
with balls and chains, demonstrated cheerfully for higher wages
outside the amusement park's main gate. ``And I don't want to run
the risk of retaliation by management after the strike is over.''
</P>
<P>
   French fascination with American popular culture is almost as
strong as French attraction to the benefits of the European welfare
state, but the clash produced a Disneyland strike as the summer
season began _ another summer that the park expects to be
profitable, after starting up heavily in the red in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``Disney asked us to help them out at the beginning by making
sacrifices, and we accepted,'' said Isabelle Perche, a member of
the French Christian Workers' Confederation who is a technician at
the park. ``Now they won't recognize they have an obligation to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   Euro Disney SCA, the company that runs the park, lost nearly $1
billion in the 1992-93 season under American management but then
hired a French chief executive, Philippe Bourguignon, and lowered
admission prices. It reported a profit of more than $36 million
last year, the third consecutive year it was in the black.
</P>
<P>
   Isabelle Clap, a spokeswoman for the company, said it was
talking with the striking employees through the weekend in hopes of
reaching a settlement. Only 40 out of 13,000 employees were
striking Saturday, the company said, not causing any disruptions to
its operations, including the parade, which had a full complement
of 12 floats.
</P>
<P>
   Few of the 13,000 are union members, Miss Perche said, and none
of the parade workers are, though hers is not the only union that
has been offering them advice; the Communist General Confederation
of Labor has also supported their demands.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of employees who sympathize with the demands
they are making,'' said Miss Perche. She said she earned about $880
a month after payroll deductions and taxes, for a 39-hour week
running attractions at the park, barely above the French minimum
wage, about $6.75 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government has raised the minimum wage by about 2 percent
a year, so mostly Disneyland has just kept even with that,'' one of
the strikers said.
</P>
<P>
   A youth who said he had played Captain Hook in the parade for
five years said there had been as many as 200 Disney employees on
the picket line.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of us earn about 7,500 francs a month gross,'' he said,
the equivalent of about $1,250. ``What we want is recognition that
under French law we should be paid as amusement park performance
artists, which would give us about 9,500.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be the equivalent of $1,580; French law also requires
employers to pay about 40 percent more in payroll taxes and
insurance and unemployment benefits, and grant all employees five
weeks of paid vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Other amusement parks in France were only seasonal, Arnaud M.
(Pluto) said, one of many reasons why he had been happy to stay at
Disneyland, open 365 days a year, for seven years, though he might
have been able to find more lucrative employment elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just fantastic to see the expressions on the faces of
little kids when you come up to them in your costume and say
hello,'' he said. ``I love what I do, but the costumes are hot and
heavy in the summer and on cold winter days you freeze, but the
show goes on no matter what.''
</P>
<P>
   Michel Dompnier, the Disneyland Paris labor relations director,
said the company had increased wages by an average of 8 percent
over the last three years, above the rate of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   He offered parade performers a chance to make more money by
paying them higher salaries when they worked in special shows, for
which they would have to audition, and unspecified improvements in
working conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The company would also make what he called ``an additional
effort in the field of training.'' Miss Perche said permanent
employees often found themselves obliged to train temporary hires
but were not given extra compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Disneyland employees in the United States probably make more
money than their French counterparts by working overtime, Miss
Perche said, but French practice is to discourage overtime and
create jobs instead. Soon Disneyland, like all other French
employers, will have to reduce the work week to 35 hours, with no
cut in pay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our way of seeing things is different,'' she said. ``I don't
think you can compare the two worlds.''

<P>
   HONG KONG _ Jumbojets from around the globe on Monday
inaugurated the new $9.1 billion Hong Kong International Airport,
one of the most advanced and architecturally dramatic airports in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Cathay Pacific was accorded the honor of the first flight when
its 15-hour nonstop jumbo jet Flight CX 889 from New York landed 10
minutes early, at 6:20 a.m. (6:20 p.m. Sunday EDT). That was
followed by about 30 more takeoffs and landings within the first
hour of operation.
</P>
<P>
   Though air travel has been diminished by the Asian financial
crisis, more than 30 million passengers a year are expected to pass
through the soaring white glass-and-steel terminal that is
described as the world's largest public building.
</P>
<P>
   Following nine years of planning, the most crucial hours in
opening the airport were the final 13 leading up to the first
commercial flights.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 5:30 p.m. Sunday evening, thousands of workers
undertook a Promethean transfer of airport loading ramps, fueling
trucks and other equipment to the new airport. The Chinese news
agency Xinhua called the move from Hong Kong's old Kai Tak airport
the biggest peacetime transfer of material ever.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong roads were closed, hundreds of police called out to
keep the order and curious locals shooed away from the 18-mile road
corridor separating the two air fields.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 vehicles in 16 convoys were scripted to haul the
apparatus necessary to make Hong Kong International function, from
tractors and pallet pushers to 70,000 sets of silverware for the
catering service.
</P>
<P>
   Heavier equipment was slotted to sail on 14 barges westward
through Victoria Harbor to the new facility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every airport has its problems,'' said the airport's corporate
development director Clinton Leeks in an interview. ``I don't know
what ours will be. We'll find out, obviously.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the airport's attractions is the Airport Express, a rail
link that connects passengers at speeds of up to 81 MPH with two
downtown check-in terminals in Hong Kong center and Kowloon. The
train takes just 23 minutes to reach the airport, which is built on
the island of Chek Lap Kok in the South China Sea 18 miles west of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Another attraction -- if it works -- is one of the world's
largest baggage handling conveyer systems. It promises to deliver
arriving luggage to the baggage carousels in 15 minutes, the
average length of time it will take passengers to have their
passports stamped and reach the baggage area.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong airport overseers originally planned to use a
computerized baggage routing system. But after dispatching an
inspection team to the new Denver airport, they decided to defer
plans for a Denver-like automatic routing system until it can be
proven at other airports.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the new Hong Kong airport recruited an army of baggage
handlers big enough to unload and route 20,000 bags an hour along
nine miles of conveyer belts.
</P>
<P>
   While landing, passengers will look down on a single gigantic
Y-shaped terminal three-quarters of a mile long that resembles the
profile of an airplane in flight. Once inside the terminal, they
will be under a giant lightweight vaulted roof big enough to
contain 85 American football fields.
</P>
<P>
   The terminal's top level is for check-in and passport control,
the middle level is for duty-free shops and departure gates, and
the bottom level is for arrivals and baggage carousels.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know where to go, you simply follow the roof,'' the British
architect Sir Norman Foster has said. ``You follow the lines of the
vaulted arch structure, and although you are moving through a
variety of spaces, you always know where you are.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, Foster has told local journalists that his design was
inspired by an old aerial photograph of Atlanta's wedge-shaped
airport terminal in the 1930s. He said he was trying to capture the
``simplicity'' of the old Atlanta airport and ``achieve that
simplicity in an international airport.''
</P>
<P>
   The new Hong Kong International, which is designed mainly for
jumbojets, has 38 terminal-side ``air bridges'' that can handle
Boeing 747s or European Airbuses. It is building 10 positions for
the 600-passenger Airbus super-jumbojets that are now under
development in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Although Hong Kong is under Chinese sovereignty, passengers will
find that Chinese censorship rules do not apply here. One of the
books prominently displayed in an airport bookshop is ``The Private
Life of Chairman Mao'' by the late communist leader Mao Tse-tung's
private physician Li Zhisui, a book banned in mainland China
because of its graphic descriptions of Mao's sexual adventures.
</P>
<P>
   On its opening day, the new Hong Kong airport expects about half
the traffic volume of the world's three busiest airports, Chicago
O'Hare (69 million passengers in 1966), Atlanta's Hartsfield (63
million in 1966) and Dallas/Fort Worth (58 million in 1966).
</P>
<P>
   But within a decade, Hong Kong airport authorities plan to open
second huge terminal, this one X-shaped, that they say will
increase the passenger capacity to 89 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong will compete with new-generation airports in Tokyo,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul to become the dominant Asian hub
in 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday was the first day of commercial flights, the
airport opened to several VIP flights last Thursday - one by
President Jiang Zemin and another by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong International Airport is part of a $20 billion air,
road and rail transportation plan that Hong Kong's British colonial
rulers announced in 1989. Beijing raised angry objections because
of the large cost, but after negotiations China and Britain reached
agreement in 1994, three years before the British handed over Hong
Kong to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hong Kong poured out in the last few days to say
good-bye to the old airport, whose downtown Kowloon location made
it a nuisance to neighboring residents and a great convenience to
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday and Sunday thousands perched on the bridges and
waterfront rocks to photograph the last thunderous jet arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Through the final day aircraft continued gliding down between
mountains and skyscrapers in the sharp right turn that for years
has paralyzed unwitting passengers wondering why their pilot was
hurtling them into the high-rise core of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Chek Lap Kok will be neither so frightening nor so
exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will still see sights,'' insisted Lily Mg, a 20-year-old
college student working with the Airport Authority this summer,
``but it won't be in such close proximity that you think you'll
land in someone's flat.''

million in 1966) and Dallas/Fort Worth (58 million in 1966).
</P>
<P>
   But within a decade, Hong Kong airport authorities plan to open
second huge terminal, this one X-shaped, that they say will
increase the passenger capacity to 89 million per year.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong will compete with new-generation airports in Tokyo,
Singapore, Kuala Lumpur and Seoul to become the dominant Asian hub
in 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   While Monday was the first day of commercial flights, the
airport opened to several VIP flights last Thursday - one by
President Jiang Zemin and another by President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong International Airport is part of a $20 billion air,
road and rail transportation plan that Hong Kong's British colonial
rulers announced in 1989. Beijing raised angry objections because
of the large cost, but after negotiations China and Britain reached
agreement in 1994, three years before the British handed over Hong
Kong to Chinese rule.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Hong Kong poured out in the last few days to say
good-bye to the old airport, whose downtown Kowloon location made
it a nuisance to neighboring residents and a great convenience to
passengers.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday and Sunday thousands perched on the bridges and
waterfront rocks to photograph the last thunderous jet arrivals.
</P>
<P>
   Through the final day aircraft continued gliding down between
mountains and skyscrapers in the sharp right turn that for years
has paralyzed unwitting passengers wondering why their pilot was
hurtling them into the high-rise core of the city.
</P>
<P>
   Arriving at Chek Lap Kok will be neither so frightening nor so
exhilarating.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will still see sights,'' insisted Lily Mg, a 20-year-old
college student working with the Airport Authority this summer,
``but it won't be in such close proximity that you think you'll
land in someone's flat.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After two congressional elections that were seen as
referendums on the nation's direction, this year's battle for
control of the House is being fought the old-fashioned way _
candidate by candidate and district by district.
</P>
<P>
   In a year marked by a pro-incumbent contentment with the
economy, only 65 House races are even considered by the political
parties to be truly competitive. Yet with the Republicans holding
one of the slimmest majorities of this century, the Democrats need
a net gain of just 11 seats to reclaim control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers mean that Rep. Newt Gingrich's longevity as
Speaker could depend less on sweeping political themes than on a
chain of local circumstances: the decision by Rep. Wes Watkins,
R-Okla., not to retire after all, or the question of whether voters
in Hawaii decide to punish Democrats, like Rep. Neil Abercrombie,
for the local economic recession.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time you don't have a presidential race going on and you
don't have a national wave one way or another,'' said Rep. Martin
Frost of Texas, chairman of the House Democrats' election
committee. ``So it's really trench warfare, district by district.''
</P>
<P>
   Candidates across the nation, of course, are still striking
certain common chords. Democrats, for instance, are riding the
reform of managed health care as a central campaign theme.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are key issues out there that are going to have an
impact,'' said Rep. Frank Pallone of New Jersey, one of the
Democrats considered potentially vulnerable by Republicans this
year. ``The one I'm focusing on is managed-care reform. And I think
people will respond because they think this is a do-nothing
Congress that is not focusing on key issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich sent his incumbents out to campaign over the July 4th
Congressional recess on a message of tax-cutting. Rep. John Linder,
the Georgian who heads the Republicans' re-election effort, said
his party will be stressing ``that we have balanced the budget with
tax cuts and put people back to work'' who had been on welfare.
</P>
<P>
   But for the first time in almost a decade, the words of the late
House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill seem most apt: ``All politics is
local.'' Strategists for the two parties sense none of the volatile
anti-Washington animus that gave a national cast to recent
elections, when voters rallied against a recession, entrenched
incumbents or legislative overreaching.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ninety-four was an election where the Republicans didn't want
to talk about anything but Bill Clinton,'' said Geoffrey Garin, a
Democratic pollster, ``ninety-six an election where Democrats
didn't want to talk about anything but Newt Gingrich. Ninety-eight
will be a different kind of election where candidates talk about
each other. There's not a single issue that's driving the election
from border to border and coast to coast.''
</P>
<P>
   In their drive to hold the majority won four years ago,
Republicans have history on their side. Traditionally, the party in
the White House loses seats in its sixth year in office. And
Republicans are forecasting at least a 10-seat gain in November.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republican incumbents, though, are being forced to struggle
for their seats. Rep. Connie Morella, a moderate from Maryland, is
thought to be facing the strongest, most well-financed challenger
of her six terms in Ralph Neas, the former executive director of
the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Neas has accused Ms. Morella of moving to the right during her
years in office. After appearing at a Fourth of July parade this
weekend, however, Ms. Morella said that by putting an emphasis on
health care, technology issues and education, she was a ``good
mirror of my district.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats see several reasons why they may be able to defy
history, starting with the fact that retirements from Congress left
them with fewer vulnerable open seats to defend this year than the
Republicans. They also boast some well-funded candidates who may be
able to overcome the GOP's usual advantage in raising money. And
even Republicans concede that the voters' ``six-year itch'' for
change may have come four years early, in 1994, when Republicans
took control of the House for the first time in nearly half a
century.
</P>
<P>
   ``With an 11-seat margin, one or two breaks the right way can
make the big difference,'' said Mark Mellman, a Democratic
strategist.
</P>
<P>
   There's no better barometer of how small events can make a
difference in the electoral math this year than the sharp mood
swings among House Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   They started the year confident of a serene election, then began
to panic in late spring that they could lose the House. Now, they
have been bolstered by a handful of recent developments that have
even nonpartisan campaign handicappers like Stuart Rothenberg and
Charlie Cook calling it unlikely that the Democrats can take the
majority.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   For one, Republican leaders made a successful appeal to Watkins
to reconsider his plans to retire. Watkins, a longtime Democrat who
changed parties and ran for Congress as a Republican in 1996, was
considered the sole Republican who could hold a seat so Democratic
that his district was long ago dubbed ``Little Dixie.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the California primary in June saw the triumph of
two moderate Republicans who are considered the party's strongest
candidates to run in districts in Sacramento and the Los Angeles
area, now held by Democrats Vic Fazio, who is retiring, and Jane
Harman, who made an unsuccessful bid for her party's gubernatorial
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   And in a special election in Albuquerque, N.M., to replace Rep.
Steven Schiff, who died of skin cancer, Republican Heather Wilson
won the seat after a Green Party candidate siphoned votes from Phil
Maloof, the Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to have some momentum from this,'' said Linder.
Democrats still say they can secure a majority of the 435 House
seats by winning eight of the 10 most competitive seats being
vacated by Republicans and then defeating nine of the weakest GOP
incumbents. That still leaves room for the Democrats to lose a
handful of their own seats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans counter that they can increase their majority by
at least 10. They are counting on winning five of the seats where
Democratic incumbents are retiring and defeating 10 other
Democrats. Those calculations allow them to lose as many as five of
their own seats, although Mary Crawford, a spokeswoman for the
Republican election effort, said, ``Our folks really believe that
unless something dramatic happens we won't lose a single
incumbent.''
</P>
<P>
   Both parties are targeting freshman lawmakers who are less
entrenched, such as Rep. Vince Snowbarger, R-Kan., and Rep. James
Maloney, D-Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats and Republicans are also fighting hardest in swing
districts that are seeing the retirement of incumbents,
particularly in the Middle West and along the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   In California alone, eight seats are considered competitive. The
politically volatile North Coast California district where Rep.
Frank Riggs is retiring could be one of the most difficult for the
Republicans to retain. State Sen. Mike Thompson, a Democrat, is
opposing Mark Luce, the Napa County supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats are likely to have trouble holding onto the
California seats of Fazio and Ms. Harman. The districts lean
Republican and the nomination of two moderate Republicans who
support abortion rights, businessman Doug Ose and Assemblyman
Steven Kuykendall, is thought to give the GOP an edge. They are
facing Sandie Dunn, a lawyer, and Janice Hahn, a businesswoman.
</P>
<P>
   In some states, the Republicans are counting on popular
governors at the top of the ticket to carry weak incumbents. Gov.
Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania is expected to help Rep. Jon Fox of the
Philadelphia suburbs. Fox won by only 84 votes in 1996 over Joseph
Hoeffel, and had to come through a primary fight this spring.
Hoeffel, a county commissioner, is challenging him again.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats say they will be able to do well in some unexpected
places, because this year their candidates better match the
philosophy of their districts. In an open seat in Kentucky, for
example, the Democrat, Ken Lucas, is a county judge who is an
anti-abortion social conservative. He faces Republican state Sen.
Gex Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign year might yet turn more volatile in its last
weeks. In 1994, the collapse of President Clinton's health-care
plan and the legislative maneuvering over the crime bill late in
the Congressional session helped propel the Republicans into the
majority. And two years ago, support for Democrats began to drop as
questions about President Clinton's campaign financing emerged in
late October.
</P>
<P>
   A wild card for both parties is the course of the investigation
of Clinton by Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel. ``The big
question none of us has been able to answer,'' said Ralph Reed, a
Republican strategist, ``is what happens with the scandal?''

 &HT;    Sore shoulder sidelines Sosa
 &HT;    By I. J. Rosenberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The All-Star Game home run derby took another power
blow Sunday when Cubs outfielder Sammy Sosa said he would not be
able to participate because of a sore left shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa, who has 33 homers and hit a record 20 in June, will also
missed Tuesday's game. He has been replaced on the roster by Reds
second baseman Brett Boone. The Cubs will not have a representative
on the active roster though Sosa will be dressing out. ``The doctor
said three to four days. I can't swing the bat,'' said Sosa, who
missed Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Why Boone?
</P>
<P>
   Every team has to have a representative and the Red traded away
theirs on Saturday, sending reliever Jeff Shaw to the Dodgers.
Boone certainly is hitting .287 with 11 homers and 55 RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of Sosa leaves the home run derby without another big
bat, Already, Seattle's Ken Griffey Jr. has said he will not
participate along with Rangers outfielder Juan Gonzalez, the major
league RBI leader, and San Diego's Greg Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   Those that have said they will be in the contest are Mark
McGwire of the Cardinals, Colorado's Vinny Castilla and Braves
third baseman Chipper Jones for the National League and Seattle's
Alex Rodriguez, Baltimore's Rafael Palmeiro, Cleveland's Jim Thome
and Detroit's Damon Easley for the AL. But each team must have five
hitters and right now Braves first baseman Andres Galarraga is not
sure if he will participate. One possibility for the NL is Braves
catcher Javier Lopez while Anaheim's Darin Erstad may suit up for
the AL. Indians shortstop Omar Vizquel, the only All-Star without a
homers, said he would be glad to fill in, adding, ``If they ask me,
I'll do it. In Colorado, everyone has a shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Around with the stars
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been announced yet by NL manager Jim Leyland but he is
expected to start Braves righthander Greg Maddux Tuesday night. He
will likely face David Wells from the Yankees. ... There will be a
new event in the home run derby with four teams each made up with a
celebrity, major league rookie and retired All-Star. Those expected
to be participating will be actor Kevin Costner, Broncos
quarterback John Elway, Dave Kingman and George Brett. ... Former
Mets star Keith Hernandez was spotted a local bar here over the
weekend and when asked what is it like being on Seinfeld in bed
with Elaine, he said, ``Ultimate professionals, those
Seinfeldians.'' ... Before taking batting practice this afternoon,
many of the All-Stars will play golf this morning at Castle Pines,
where the PGA will hold an even in August. ... Colorado's Castilla
and Ivan Rodriguez of the Rangers will duel each in a video
baseball showdown today. ... Some of the hottest memorabilia at the
FanFest has the name McGwire on it. Said one sports collector shop
owner from St. Louis: ``Everybody wants a McGwire. But the stuff is
just not out there. It's impossible.''

 &HT;    Wild ending sends Braves to break with 12 1/2 game lead in NL
East
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The season's first half didn't merely end Sunday. It
went out with a Grade B riot, Braves prancing off one side of
Turner Field with their most dominant start ever, the Mets in
purple rage slam-dancing the umpires off the other side like a
lynch mob looking for a tree.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he'd ever been so pursued after the last out before,
crew chief Randy Marsh replied, ''Dominican winter league. Then
when you get off the field, they have the paddy wagon to take you
back to the hotel.''
</P>
<P>
   The Braves beat New York 3-2 in the 11th inning on the merit of
Walt Weiss' so short sacrifice fly and an ensuing collision at home
plate between Michael Tucker and Mets catcher Mike Piazza. Plate
ump Angel Hernandez called Tucker safe and provoking nearly a
minute of civil disobedience as New York pitcher John Franco,
manager Bobby Valentine and Piazza and eventually the whole Mets
roster made for an umpire mosh pit.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets cried rotten call and illegal slide. The Braves
celebrated around Tucker's right foot, which the team claims found
the plate beneath Piazza. Anyone who says he has no doubts about
the play isn't being truthful. But what remained afterwards was a
three-game sweep of the Mets, an eight-game Atlanta win streak, a
12-1/2 game lead in the NL East (the Braves' biggest ever) and 59
wins by a club that just last week was turned sideways.
</P>
<P>
   ''You gotta give an A to the first half,'' said third baseman
Chipper Jones. ''There's not much more we could have done.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy Seanez, Atlanta's fifth pitcher of the day, earned his
first victory as a Brave after the bullpen shut out New York for
the last four innings. The Braves had men in scoring position in
both the ninth and 10th but loaded the bases on Franco on two hit
batters and a single. That brought up Weiss, who worked out a 2-1
count before sending a liner into left.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I hit it, I said, alright, base hit. Game over,'' Weiss
said. ''But the outfield was playing right behind the infield and
when (Bernard Gilkey) caught it, I didn't think Tuck had a chance
to score.''
</P>
<P>
   But Tucker tagged up anyway, Gilkey's throw came on one hop and
Piazza cradled the ball waiting the the collision, which Tucker
provided an instant later.
</P>
<P>
   ''He made a very illegal slide, cut him up and never touched the
plate,'' said Valentine. ``He landed in his lap.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, he landed all over him and while video replays can
support either team, Hernandez ruled Tucker's foot reached the
plate before any contact with the catcher's mitt.
</P>
<P>
   ''If the ball gets there,'' asked Tucker, ''and he tags you on
your knee, where's the rest of your foot at?''
</P>
<P>
   On the All-Star break, that's where.

ONE YEAR LATER, ASIAN ECONOMIC CRISIS IS WORSENING 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Japan, China, Russia, Mexico)  (mk) 
 By DAVID E. SANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Few alarm bells rang here a year ago this weekend,
when Thailand's currency melted down.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were no crisis meetings,'' recalled Daniel Tarullo,
President Clinton's top international economic adviser until a few
months ago, ``and certainly no sense that this was the start of an
economic crisis that might roll around the world.''
</P>
<P>
   It turned out to be just that. A year later, there is no end in
sight _ after three huge international bailouts, the forced
resignation of Asia's longest-serving ruler, a banking crisis in
Japan and trouble looming from Russia to South Africa to Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   The economic crisis that was supposed to be abating now, much as
Mexico's did after a year, is growing more intense.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike a nuclear test in India or a provocation from Iraq, this
crisis started so slowly that in November, Clinton dismissed it as
``a few small glitches in the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Today it stands as the largest single threat to the six-year
economic boom in the United States. While the effects on most
Americans have been remote, factories are beginning to slow,
exports are beginning to pile up on the docks and members of
Congress from agricultural states are beginning to speak publicly
about the need for swift action, even if they are unsure what that
action should be.
</P>
<P>
   From the White House to the International Monetary Fund,
officials are concerned that the effects of the crisis will be
worse and longer-lasting than they thought even three months ago.
What particularly scares Clinton administration officials, though
they are loath to say so on the record, is that the unpredictable
economic contagion is no longer limited to the Pacific Rim.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just look at how our view of this has changed in the past
year,'' said one of Clinton's top advisers. ``First it was all
about Thailand. Then it was about containing this all to Southeast
Asia. And look at where all this is headed in the next year:
Russia, Japan, maybe China _ the superpowers.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton alluded to this fear in Hong Kong on Friday, wrapping up
his tour of China. ``Restoring economic stability and growth will
not be easy,'' he said. ``The steps required will be politically
unpopular and will take courage. But the United States will do all
we can to help any Asian government willing to work itself back to
financial health.''
</P>
<P>
   Just what kind of help he has in mind was left vague. He can
send Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and his deputy, Lawrence
Summers, on more trips around the globe urging countries to follow
the monetary fund's conditions for loans _ a mixture of budget
austerity and high interest rates that is now being adjusted to
dampen street protests by laid-off workers and by families who
cannot buy gasoline or food.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's statement of commitment in Hong Kong, his
options are limited. Congress is deeply reluctant to contribute an
additional $18 billion to the monetary fund. The battle has turned
into a bitter struggle over the fund's traditional secrecy, its
track record and animosity among some members of Congress toward
international organizations of any kind.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Summers likens denying the fund this money to ``canceling your
life insurance just after you've been diagnosed with a
life-threatening disease.''
</P>
<P>
   But the IMF's record is mixed at best, and Republicans cite
harsh criticism of its actions by everyone from Milton Friedman,
the well-known economist, to former Secretary of State George
Shultz.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Fischer, the No. 2 official at the fund, dismisses their
arguments that the fund has made the crisis worse as ``nonsense.''
But right or wrong, it is a view that is gaining political currency
in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has made clear that he has no intention of repeating his
own successful bailout of Mexico. In that case, he circumvented
Congress, using a fund controlled by the Treasury and the Federal
Reserve to lend $12 billion to Mexico, one of America's largest
trading partners.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear what the United States will do if Russia
desperately needs aid in the next few months and the IMF says it
does not have the resources.
</P>
<P>
   It is not only Congress and the administration that are at odds.
The World Bank, which focuses on issues of poverty and development,
is critical of its sister institution, the monetary fund. The State
Department carps that the Treasury has focused on reforming banking
systems and opening markets but paid too little attention to
America's broader strategic interests.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, one senior intelligence official acknowledged, ``hasn't
a clue how to deal with this kind of crisis, where the enemy is the
markets or a finance ministry that lies about a country's currency
reserves.''
</P>
<P>
   The only point of agreement, in fact, is that Washington
officials are publicly understating the depth of the problems so
that they do not scare the markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is off the radar screens in terms of severity,'' said
Allen Sinai, the chief global economist at Primark Decision
Systems, an investment advisory group. ``It is the single most
negative economic event since the Great Depression in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what makes this problem so distinct is that it is not just
an economic bust. It is laced with every type of financial crisis
and instability that has ever shown up in the real world or any
textbook. And while there are some brilliant minds working on it,
no one can deal with it _ not Rubin, not Summers, not any single
country, not the IMF.''
</P>
<P>
   Without question, an astounding array of economic and political
predictions emerging from Washington and Wall Street in the last
year have proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the Treasury and private economists said last
summer that they expected that the problems confronting Thailand
would follow the Mexico pattern. The surprise devaluation of the
peso triggered sell-offs in other emerging markets, giving rise to
the phrase ``economic contagion,'' but after three or four months,
markets settled down. After a year of pain, Mexico was on the mend.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But the Asian crisis today looks nothing like Mexico's. The
economic contagion has yet to stop. It just smolders underground
for a while, erupting in various places around the globe as
investors take a new look at a country and suddenly see a host of
risks that should have been obvious before. They head for the
exits, pulling money out of the currency and the stock markets.
That turns long-festering but manageable problems into an immediate
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   There were other misguided predictions. When the monetary fund
devised a $43 billion bailout plan for Indonesia in October,
American officials and the fund described it as deliberate
overkill.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's economy was in fundamentally better shape than other
nations', they said, and President Suharto's iron control over the
country made it easier to get the country back on track.
</P>
<P>
   But the economy turned out to be in worse condition than it
appeared. And Suharto resisted the monetary fund's urgings for
months, privately telling former Vice President Walter Mondale, who
was sent there on a special mission, ``If I do these things, they
will throw me out of office.''
</P>
<P>
   When Suharto was forced to resign after riots took 1,200 lives,
the Natonal Security Council estimated that his successor, B.J.
Habibie, would be gone within weeks. That was two months ago, and
Habibie seems to be settling in.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to many early predictions, the U.S. economy has so far
been helped as much as it has been hurt by the events in Asia.
While exports are down, both the reduction of activity and price
competition from abroad kept inflation contained. That has given
the Federal Reserve a reason to keep interest rates down.
</P>
<P>
   Then this spring, there was premature optimism. The IMF declared
that the crisis was stabilizing. Rubin told Congress that a
reignition of systemic, global economic trouble was ``a
low-probability event.'' But within a month, the eruption of
Japan's banking crisis sent the yen plunging again, and that
undercut other currencies througout East Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Fearful of broader contagion, Rubin reluctantly ordered the
United States to buy $2 billion in yen to help calm the markets. In
return he received assurances from Japanese politicans that they
would act. On Thursday they announced a plan to reform the
country's banks.
</P>
<P>
   But the initial verdict from the markets was that the plan was
too vague, and the yen plunged again, taking markets throughout
Asia with it.
</P>
<P>
   Today Asia faces two big questions. The first is whether Japan
will lead a recovery or worsen the pain. The second is whether the
monetary fund _ and by extension the Treasury, which has enormous
leverage over the fund's policies _ has the right formula.
</P>
<P>
   The fund's solution has been to urge countries to raise interest
rates, in hopes of attracting back investors who were fleeing from
their currencies, and to balance their budgets. As investors
trickle back in, the theory is, interest rates can fall and the
currency will gradually strengthen.
</P>
<P>
   That has happened, modestly, in South Korea. But the most common
criticism is that high interest rates are killing otherwise healthy
businesses and the budget austerity is contributing to shrinking
the national economies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The year has been a fiasco, and so has the policy,'' said
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who has been among the
administration's fiercest critics. ``Asia would have been better if
the IMF had never set foot in these countries. All these strategies
were designed to restore the confidence of the markets, and they
didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   While many applauded the monetary fund's attack on crony
capitalism and particularly on the Suharto-controlled cartels in
Indonesia, that effort may not have struck at the heart of the
country's economic troubles. But it did build credibility for the
fund among the Indonesian people and on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin and Fischer argue strenuously that if the monetary fund
had failed to step in, a bad situation would have turned
disastrous.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a balancing act,'' said Fischer, ``and we constantly
readjust the mix to get it right. But I can't believe that serious
people believe that without temporarily increasing interest rates,
we could have contained the problems'' caused by plunging
currencies.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest risk to these countries in Asia, Fischer argues, is
not the IMF's prescriptions, but its rapidly-depleting treasury.
``If this situation were to worsen,'' he said, ``and we needed to
provide additional aid, we would simply not have the resources.''
The fund has only $10 billion to $15 billion left to lend out
before it has to take extraordinary measures, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents in Congress say the fund has plenty of untapped
resources and is crying wolf.

 &HT;    Pete Sampras wins fifth Wimbledon
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Clarke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ The brown, dried out grass on Centre Court
feels as comfortable as his own practice court to Pete Sampras _
even on the last day of Wimbledon, when the stands are filled with
distractions and the turf pocked with wear.
</P>
<P>
   It is a homey place, where Sampras can curse the bad bounces or
bless the hard ground, even though he still gets more nervous for a
final here than anywhere else.
</P>
<P>
   The top seed did all three Sunday before defeating 14th seed
Goran Ivanisevic 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2 in 2 hours,
52 minutes and then taking the fifth victory lap of his career
around his favorite court in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to all the finals I've played, this is by far the
toughest,'' Sampras said. ``Obviously, you never forget the first
one, but it's hard to believe that I've won five.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic, the 26-year-old soccer-loving Croatian, wasbereft
after losing what he called his best chance at a Grand Slam title.
Following the match, he briefly displayed the second-place trophy
for the crowd, but his drooping head and shoulders expressed his
disappointment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot cheer for anybody now,'' he said, explaining that he
will not go to France to watch his country play in the World Cup
semifinals Wednesday. ``I can only kill myself. It's the worst
moment of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   But for Sampras, this comes close to the best of his life.
</P>
<P>
   His five Wimbledon titles tie the Open Era record set by Bjorn
Borg in 1980. It also gives Sampras 11 Grand Slam victories in his
10-year career. His goal has long been to break Roy Emerson's
record of 12 Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Laver and Borg, both Sampras' heroes when he was growing up
in Los Angeles, are the only two others to win 11 Grand Slams.
Sampras said he believes he can win six Wimbledons, but he said
Sunday was a day to celebrate No. 5.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not thinking much about next year,'' Sampras said. ``(This
year) is going to take a little bit of time to sink in because as a
kid when I saw Borg's five, I never thought that I would be in a
position to tie it. It's a little overwhelming to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory also ensures Sampras, 26, will remain No. 1 in the
world _ a loss would have moved Marcelo Rios ahead of him _ and
should help quiet the critics charging that Sampras was distracted
and his career was waning.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a year since his last Grand Slam victory, longer
than between any Grand Slam victories since the 1994 and 1995
Wimbledon. He had heard the talk but didn't pay much attention to
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You play at a certain level for a number of years and you
don'tplay well for three months or four months and people think
you're done,'' Sampras said. ``It's flattering to be at that
standard, but now I guess I'm out of my slump.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't easy. Part of the reason for the `slump' is that
Sampras has lost eight matches this year, only won two titles and
players, even himself, finally consider the five-year No. 1
beatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurts the most,'' Ivanisevic said, comparing his three
losses in the Wimbledon final. ``Because this time I had the
chance. He didn't play well.''
</P>
<P>
   Both started nervously, each double faulting often and blowing
break-point chances in the first set before heading to a tiebreaker
that Ivanisevic won easily. The second set also went to a
tiebreaker, which Sampras won and considered a turning point.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic got two second serves, when he was up 6-5 and 8-7 in
the tiebreaker. He only needed one to win the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew these two set points are going to my backhand, and I
missed them both, which is ridiculous,'' Ivanisevic said.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras won the tiebreaker on his third set point. In the next
set, he earned a service break and that was all he needed to win.
In the fourth, Ivanisevic earned the break _ on a string of four
stunning passing shots _ and won the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit four great shots,'' Sampras said. ``That's too good. I
knew it was going to a fifth set at that point.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't a good set. Sampras broke Ivanisevic in the sixth
game, and the world's 25th-ranked player started to resemble the
moody, inconsistent player he has the reputation of being.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fourth and fifth sets, my legs were not fresh, like I
was supposed to be, and I didn't move into the net,'' Ivanisevic
said.``Yes. Five-four against (Richard) Krajicek cost me this
final.''
</P>
<P>
   He lost two match points at 5-4 in the fourth set of his
semifinal against Krajicek on Friday. He lost that set and played
another 77 minutes in the fifth before winning 15-13.
</P>
<P>
   He didn't have the energy or the mental fight for another
longfifth set. Sampras broke Ivanisevic at love in the final game.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Ivanisevic's self-loathing after the match,
Sampraspraised his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to win this event, I feel,'' Sampras said. ``His
game is too big and his serve is too big. You just need a little
bit of luck to win any major and he just hasn't seemed to have
gotten that in his three finals.''

SOFTWARE PIRACY AND A RETRACTED RELEASE 
BUYING CARS ONLINE WITH `REASONABLE OFFERS'

<P>
   SOFTWARE PIRACY AND A RETRACTED RELEASE
</P>
<P>
   The Software Publishers Association got a little ahead of itself
last week in promoting its efforts to crack down on software
piracy. Last Monday, it sent out a two-page press release
indicating that it had reached an out-of-court settlement for
$150,000 with a New Jersey medical supply company. The release
stated that the company, Edison-based International Technidyne
Corp., agreed that it had used unlicensed or pirated software from
23 of the association's companies.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one catch: The company had agreed to settle, but
not to have the settlement disclosed. Hours after the release went
out, company lawyers called the Software Publishers Association and
demanded a retraction. The trade group acquiesced, distributing a
new release, which read in its entirety:
</P>
<P>
   ``Earlier today the Software Publishers Association (SPA) issued
a press release entitled `Software Piracy Costs NJ Firm $150,000.'
SPA retracts the release. Neither SPA nor the company concerned
will now comment publicly. SPA apologizes for any inconvenience
this may have caused.''
</P>
<P>
   David Phelps, a spokesman for the Software Publishers, explained
afterward that the organization had been eager to get its latest
victory to the press. ``As a good PR department, we wanted to get
the news out,'' Phelps said, but ``we didn't look closely enough''
at the settlement agreement. ``We've got to take our licks on this
one,'' he said, adding that the trade group will be more cautious
in the future.
</P>
<P>
   The association has good reason to highlight its victories. For
one, it needs to justify its existence to some 1,200 members,
including most of the major software makers in the United States.
Less cynically, it hopes to drive home the message that it will
pursue and audit companies that don't pay for the software they
use.
</P>
<P>
   Gerry Feldman, president of International Technidyne, had little
to say on the matter. ``We feel bound by the confidentiality
agreement,'' Feldman said. ``We're surprised to have to comment on
this at all.''
</P>
<P>
   BUYING CARS ONLINE WITH `REASONABLE OFFERS'
</P>
<P>
   Will car dealers be more willing than airlines to leap at
dollars dangled under their noses?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question facing Priceline, an Internet service that
is meant to let consumers buy things by making ``reasonable
offers'' that sellers can choose whether to accept.
</P>
<P>
   Priceline's first service, for air tickets, met a chilly
response from airlines, which do not want to undercut their high
last-minute fares for business travelers by letting customers
propose their own discounted offers. Only a few domestic airlines
have agreed to participate, and so Priceline can fill only about a
quarter of customer offers, which must be within 15 percent of the
lowest published fare.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday, Priceline plans to introduce a car-buying service
with fewer restrictions than its airline service, and it may have a
better chance of acceptance among the many highly competitive car
dealers. In essence, consumers log on to Priceline.com and specify
the cars they are looking for along with the options and colors
they would accept, and the price they will pay. These offers are
sent by fax to every car dealer within the region specified by the
buyer. The first dealer to call and accept the bid sells the car.
Dealers can also submit a counteroffer.
</P>
<P>
   In existing online car buying services, like Autoweb, Carpoint
and Autobytel, customers enter the car they want. Then, typically,
one dealer calls them back to name a price and try to close a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing about our service is that you never talk to a
car salesman,'' said Jay Walker, Priceline's chairman. ``You show
up with your check and you drive the car home.''
</P>
<P>
   A WINDOWLESS LINE OF COMPUTERS
</P>
<P>
   As a market test, Ralph Nader's Consumer Project on Technology
recently tried to order a personal computer from a dozen companies
without Microsoft's Windows as the operating system. No luck,
reported David Chun, the Nader summer intern who made the calls to
Dell Computer, Gateway, IBM and others _ not even when he asked for
a PC with no operating system at all.
</P>
<P>
   He should have called VA Research in Mountain View, Calif. The
upstart computer maker specializes in machines that run Linux, a
freeware version of the Unix operating system. Linux (pronounced
(LINN-uks) originated in 1991, written by a young Finnish
programmer, Linus Torvalds.
</P>
<P>
   VA Research began in 1993 as a part-time venture for Larry
Augustin, then working on his doctorate in electrical engineering
at Stanford University. He could not afford a costly Sun
Microsystems work station, so he decided to build his own
high-powered machine, using Linux and off-the-shelf hardware.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Linux has become a more mainstream operating system,
and VA Research is beginning to take off, but Augustin, 35,
declines to disclose revenues for the private company. VA
Research's machines start at $1,500, but the line extends to server
models that can cost tens of thousands of dollars. Its customers
include Southwestern Bell, a unit of SBC Communications Inc., which
uses the Linux machines in its call-processing centers.
</P>
<P>
   Linux users worldwide now number about 6 million, tiny compared
with the more than 300 million for Windows. Still, as Augustin sees
it: ``Microsoft is always going to get its share. But Linux does
have a future as a genuine alternative to Windows.''

HMOS ARE CUTTING BACK COVERAGE OF THE POOR AND ELDERLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.Y., N.J., Mass., Fla., Ore., Conn., Utah, Ohio, Calif.,
Mo., Ariz., N.C.)  (lh) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Citing losses and cuts in government payments, the
nation's biggest health maintenance organizations are quitting
managed care programs for the poor and elderly.
</P>
<P>
   Their retreat is most pronounced in Medicaid programs. Health
care analysts warn of a reversal of government progress this decade
in steering the poor into the mainstream of the health care system,
both to provide good care and hold down costs.
</P>
<P>
   And advocates for patients say they fear the retreat will mean a
return to crowded ``Medicaid mill'' clinics delivering inferior
care.
</P>
<P>
   Managed care organizations like Aetna U.S. Healthcare,
Pacificare, Oxford Health Plans, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross
and Blue Shield Associations have shut down some of their Medicaid
services in at least 12 states, including New York, New Jersey,
Florida, Massachusetts and Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals have spread to Medicare-managed programs for the
elderly, primarily in rural communities with few patients and where
clinics and doctors are scarce. In May, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue
Shield said it was pulling out of Medicare plans in 19 Ohio
counties. Last month, Health Net, a large California HMO, said it
would end its Medicare service in 10 counties.
</P>
<P>
   In other states, the HMOs run by the companies are reducing
services to Medicare patients and charging them for care that had
been fully covered.
</P>
<P>
   But it is Medicaid, whose costs are shared by the federal
government and the states, and half of whose 32 million recipients
are in managed care programs, that has been most affected.
</P>
<P>
   ``Medicaid has gone sour'' for a lot of HMOs, said Robert
Hurley, an associate professor at Virginia Commonwealth University
who is studying the phenomenon. In Medicaid, ``the high water mark
for commercial HMOs was probably last year,'' Hurley said, adding
that the withdrawals began then and had been accelerating recently.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of HMOs continue to operate Medicaid programs, and some
big ones, like Kaiser and United Healthcare, which have ended the
programs in some states, remain committed to programs in others.
</P>
<P>
   Only Utah, with a sparse population and particularly low
reimbursement rates for Medicare and Medicaid services, is losing
all of its managed care programs for people in those medical plans.
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Halverson, vice president for Medicaid programs at
United Healthcare in Minneapolis, which has pulled Medicaid
operations out of Ohio and St. Louis, said that the poor are ``a
population we want to serve.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to evaluate every opportunity to see if it's
something we can participate in,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Some state Medicaid directors acknowledge the trend but say they
can live with it. Bruce M. Bullen, the Massachusetts commissioner
for medical assistance and chairman of the National Association of
State Medicaid Directors, said, ``We do see a number of commercial
plans taking a second look at the Medicaid market.''
</P>
<P>
   But with higher standards for service and quality, and
reimbursement rates that he said were competitive, Bullen added,
``we've raised the bar a bit for HMOs.''
</P>
<P>
   Clients who have been shed are faced with finding doctors who
will treat them for the Medicaid fee, getting charity care or going
to emergency rooms or to other HMOs that often specializing in
Medicaid clients.
</P>
<P>
   More and more of the new plans have been formed by public
hospitals and community clinics serving the poor, in effect
providing them with a safety net in medical care. The trend toward
HMOs serving Medicaid patients only, consumer advocates and health
care analysts warn, portends a return to the low-budget, unmanaged
care that the large commercial HMOs helped remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are beginning to watch this,'' said Sally Richardson,
director of Medicaid and State Operations at the Health Care
Financing Administration, which oversees Medicaid and Medicare.
``The concern is that managed care programs have sufficient
alternatives for beneficiaries to have access'' to good care.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the withdrawals from Medicaid care have come in the most
populous states with large pockets of urban poverty. The Tufts
Health Plan dropped out of the Massachusetts Medicaid program two
weeks ago, and the state's Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association
dropped out in February.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the past year, eight organizations, including Aetna U.S.
Healthcare and Prudential, have dropped Medicaid programs in New
York state. Aetna, the second biggest HMO, is also closing them in
Connecticut, leaving only New Jersey among states where it provides
Medicaid managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Oxford Health Plans, which reported a $291 million overall loss
last year, is withdrawing from Medicaid in New Jersey and
Connecticut. In March, Kaiser Permanente, the biggest HMO, quit
Medicaid care in Charlotte, N.C., and last year Humana did so in
St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Pacificare, the nation's third largest HMO, has decided to drop
all Medicaid services, closing programs in California, Oregon and
Utah. At least three companies have left Florida, and two are in
receivership.
</P>
<P>
   The withdrawals highlight the dashed expectations of both the
companies, for attractive profits from government-financed managed
care, and the government, for sharp reductions in the cost of care.
</P>
<P>
   Like industry, which has steered 85 percent of the work force
into managed care, the states and the Clinton administration are
trying to contain the cost of care, but they are driving a harder
bargain.
</P>
<P>
   While businesses have generally frozen payments to HMOs for four
years and are allowing increases of about 5 percent this year, some
states have slashed payments since the mid-1990s by up to 20
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Before most of the cuts took effect, the HMOs rushed into
managed care plans for Medicaid recipients. From less than 10
percent, or 2.7 million of 28.3 million Medicaid beneficiaries in
1991, they captured 48 percent, or 15.4 million, of the 32.1
million beneficiaries in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But as the states cut reimbursement rates for Medicare, the
organizations suffered growing losses. ``These ambitions of
enormous savings have proven to be totally unrealistic,'' Paul
Offner, the District of Columbia's commissioner for health care
finance, said of government expectations.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, said Bruce M. Fried, a health care lawyer in
Washington and until earlier this year the director of the Clinton
administration's Office of Managed Care: ``Some of the best plans
have said, `We can't do business on this basis. We're going to have
to leave the system.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some health care organizations acknowledge some naivete in
embarking on Medicaid managed care. ``We had not been in the
Medicaid market, and the decision was made to expand into it,''
said Richard Hannon, senior vice president for marketing at Blue
Cross and Blue Shield in Phoenix. ``We considered it good to serve
a broad range of Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   So in 1994, Blue Cross was awarded a three-year contract and
enrolled 45,000 Medicaid recipients. Offered a new contract last
year, the company balked after large losses. ``We got out because
we found it extremely difficult to manage that patient base,''
Hannon said.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Potter, deputy director of Arizona's Medicaid program,
said: ``They had a big learning curve. They bid a rate. There were
others at that rate that were able to survive.''
</P>
<P>
   Difficulties in serving Medicaid beneficiaries is not limited to
inexperienced HMOs. Maura Bluestone is the director of the Bronx
Health Plan in New York, which has 38,000 subscribers, 80 percent
of whom are Medicaid patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reimbursement is a real difficult issue,'' Ms. Bluestone said.
New York state chopped its reimbursements to the plan by 24 percent
in 1995, she said. Part of the reduction was subsequently restored.
Still, before the cuts, Bronx Health Plan was receiving $200 a
month to care for each enrolled adult, 21-64 years old, while it
now receives $164, or 18 percent less.
</P>
<P>
   She said the state had also raised the quality-of-care standards
it required the plans to meet, raising the cost of care. ``In a
way,'' she said, ``it's a setup for failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathematica Policy Research, a private organization, reports
that the number of managed care organizations with Medicaid
contracts climbed to 355 in 1996 from 166 in 1993. But among them,
those serving Medicaid clients exclusively or primarily rose to 44
percent from 39 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The shift can be good for the poor, said Sara Rosenbaum,
director of the Center for Health Policy Research at George
Washington University here, because they benefit from access to
well-run organizations experienced in treating them.
</P>
<P>
   But Diane Rowland, executive director of the Kaiser Commission
on Medicaid and the Uninsured, sees the trend more ominously. HMOs
that serve only the poor are unable to shift profits from serving
healthier clients to the poor, as more diverse HMOs do, Ms. Rowland
said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, when reimbursement rates are cut, she said, the
Medicaid-only HMOs become especially vulnerable. ``There's no way
to cost-shift,'' she said, ``and that's where you start to see real
skimping on care.''
</P>
<P>
   The more recent HMO retreat from Medicare managed care services
poses few such quality-of-care issues for the elderly. Dr. Robert
Berenson, director of the Health Care Financing Administration's
Center for Health Plans and Providers, said about 1 million elderly
beneficiaries are joining managed care plans each year and that he
is rapidly approving new plans to meet a growing demand.
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall trend is for expansion,'' Berenson said.
</P>
<P>
   But in Medicare, too, the health organizations are scrutinizing
the marketplace to avoid more losses. They note that increases in
their government reimbursements have slowed to 2 percent a year,
below the rate of health care inflation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cost in many markets is well north of that,'' said David
Olson, spokesman for Foundation Health Systems in Woodland Hills,
Calif., the parent of Health Net. In addition to the 10 counties
Health Net is abandoning, he said, ``We're closely examining our

   ANTELOPE VALLEY, Calif. _ The scenery around the retirement
community that Linda Moss manages here is flat, chalky and
desolate, and the slow-moving, spindly-legged retirees don't have
much to occupy their days.
</P>
<P>
   But the sun is reliable, the company is dependable and the
alternative might be considered harsh. The roughly 300 residents in
Ms. Moss' care almost exited life as sausages or steaks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moss runs a rescue center in this dust bowl between Los
Angeles and the Mojave Desert for old, disabled or unwanted horses
that were bound for slaughterhouses in Texas or Nebraska and for
sale abroad to French, Belgian or Japanese restaurants and meat
shops.
</P>
<P>
   The animals on her 40-acre ranch are refugees from an industry
and culinary tradition of which few Americans are even aware. They
are also poster creatures for one of the latest initiative drives
in the nation's most populous state.
</P>
<P>
   Come November, Californians, who recently weighed in on the
fates of bilingual education and affirmative action, will be asked
to decide the destiny of horses: specifically, whether to make it
illegal to participate in the sale or purchase of a horse pegged
for human ingestion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the least we can do for a nice animal that's given so
much to us,'' Cathleen Doyle, one of the initiative's principal
backers, said as she walked with Ms. Moss among the Arabians,
Clydesdales and thoroughbreds at the Equus Sanctuary here.
</P>
<P>
   These women and their allies have named the initiative ``Save
the Horses'' and hitched it to a number of informal slogans,
including ``Off the Table, In the Stable'' and ``Just Say Neigh.''
It is intended to spare what Ms. Doyle estimated to be about 10,000
horses in California every year from winding up as breakfast, lunch
or dinner.
</P>
<P>
   But the referendum also draws attention to people's complicated,
contradictory attitudes toward the animals they raise and to the
fuzzy, fickle lines they draw between acceptable and unacceptable
uses of different beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the supporters of ``Save the Horses'' happily chew the
flesh of cows and pigs and issue no particular lament over horses
dragging heavy carriages of wealthy tourists through American
cities in the oppressive summer heat.
</P>
<P>
   But sirloin of pinto? ``It just strikes the wrong chord,'' said
Bill Hemby, a legislative advocate for the California Organization
of Police and Sheriffs, one of several groups to endorse the
referendum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't give you a hard and fast ideological reason,'' Hemby
said. ``I guess it's just that if we're going to breed horses or
dogs for pleasure or show, we have an obligation not to eat them.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the referendum say that's a silly strain of
sentimentalism that ignores the logic of finding a profitable use
for unneeded horses and that disingenuously equates horses with
household pets.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want horses recognized as `companion animals,' '' said
Brent Heberlein, general manager of Beltex Corp. in Fort Worth,
Texas, which slaughters horses from all over the country and
exports their meat, mostly to France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean everybody's going to be walking their horse
around the block before work in the morning?'' Heberlein asked.
``Or taking it to the 7-Eleven to pick up a quart of milk?''
</P>
<P>
   Although few if any restaurants or stores in the United States
sell horsemeat, similar establishments in other countries do, and
animal welfare advocates estimate that about 100,000 horses are
slaughtered in the United States every year to supply those foreign
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Several thousand additional horses from the United States are
transported to Mexico or Canada to be killed there. Advocates said
they have received reports of horses being flown to Japan to be
eaten raw and thinly sliced, like sashimi.
</P>
<P>
   This trade has existed for decades and is not only legal, but
also regulated by the Department of Agriculture. Horse owners get
several hundred dollars from traders, and the slaughterhouses that
buy and kill the horses send the low-fat, high-protein meat to
countries where it fetches as much as $15 a pound and is eaten by
people who could well afford other foods.
</P>
<P>
   The California measure, the first of its kind, would affect only
animals and transactions within the state, making it a crime to
sell or buy a horse, mule, donkey or meat from any of these animals
if it is intended to feed people. But its supporters say they hope
it will spark similar referendums in other states.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative's promoters do not oppose the rendering of horses
into products from pet food to paint thinner because horses used
for these purposes are killed painlessly.
</P>
<P>
   But horses to be eaten by people cannot be pumped full of drugs,
which would taint their meat. Like cattle, they must be
slaughtered, and the method is similar: a long metal nail is shot
into their heads to knock them out, then they are hoisted into the
air and drained of blood.
</P>
<P>
   Trina Bellak, an executive with the Humane Society of the United
States, said a horse's experience of this is more terrifying than a
cow's. Because a horse is more likely to thrash its head in the
killing stall, Ms. Bellak said, several metal nails are sometimes
need to topple the animal.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Bellak also said that the way horses are transported to
slaughterhouses, packed into trucks for trips that can last two
days, disregards their panicky reaction to crowding.
</P>
<P>
   ``Horses get very territorial and have a personal space issue,''
Ms. Bellak said.
</P>
<P>
   But beyond all this, supporters of ``Save the Horses'' say they
object to what they see as a violation of the unspoken human
covenant with horses, which have long been treated with more
affection than common livestock.
</P>
<P>
   It was not a pig, after all, that Elizabeth Taylor rode in
``National Velvet,'' and neither ``My Friend Flicka'' nor ``Black
Beauty'' is easily imagined with a cow in the title roles.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>

<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Doyle noted that many states have laws that forbid the
killing of cats or dogs for food, even though there are countries
where people eat these animals. She argued that horses deserve
equal protection.
</P>
<P>
   And she took pains to distinguish and distance herself and the
initiative from efforts to end the use of animals in medical
testing or ban fur. ``We are not animal rights activists,'' Ms.
Doyle said. ``We are equine preservationists. We are horse people.
We do horse issues.''
</P>
<P>
   But Heberlein said that horse owners deserve to be able to
salvage some money for animals that are more expensive to support _
and to euthanize _ than cats or dogs.
</P>
<P>
   It can cost several hundred dollars to have a horse humanely
killed and carted away by a rendering company, and the initiative's
critics warn that owners denied any other option might abandon
unwanted horses.
</P>
<P>
   The handful of horse sanctuaries throughout California,
supported by private donations, can only buy and support a tiny
percentage of the horses at the auctions that supply
slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
   The Redwings Horse Sanctuary in Carmel has just 38 horses on a
patch of land with a spectacular view of the Pacific. One of them,
Mirage, was gestating in his mother's belly when she was rescued.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty close call there, huh, fellow?'' Barbara Clarke, the
director of Redwings, said as she stroked his mane.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Clarke also has a few horses that she said were rescued as
young, healthy ponies. They had been taken from their mothers so
that their mothers would get pregnant again quickly. The reason,
she said, is that the hormone-dense urine of pregnant mares is used
in a drug for post-menopausal women.
</P>
<P>
   And she has a pen of six aggressively friendly donkeys that she
said might have become ``donkey jerky'' if they had not ended up
with her.
</P>
<P>
   At the Equus Sanctuary, Ms. Moss attributes extraordinary
sensitivity to the horses in her care.
</P>
<P>
   In a brochure, she describes their condition just before rescue
as hopeless and devastated by their betrayal. One horse, Mack, is
identified as one of the ``elder members of our non-human sector.''
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the tragedies of our society,'' the brochure muses,
``is the abandonment of senior citizens.''

YANKEES TIE RECORD FOR MOST WINS IN 81 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Pa.)  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time a major league baseball team won 61 of
its first 81 games, Theodore Roosevelt was president of the United
States, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were newlyweds and a
precocius child named George Herman Ruth, later known as the Babe,
had just left his father's saloon in Baltimore for a school for
wayward boys. The last time until Sunday, that is, when the Yankees
defeated the Baltimore Orioles to make their record 61-20, equaling
the start of the 1907 Chicago Cubs and the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees of 1927 are generally considered to be the greatest
team of all time, its lineup graced by the famed Murderers Row;
that group won 57 of its first 81 games. Whether the Yankees of
1998 will be compared favorably to the '27 Yankees, the 1961
Yankees, the 1976 Cincinnati Reds or any of baseball's other great
teams will depend on whether they win the World Series, and whether
they continue to win at such an astounding rate during the regular
season. They are on a pace to win 122 games, which would shatter
the existing 20th century records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be proud,'' said David Cone, who is one of three
Yankee pitchers with 10 or more victories. ``It's a great start.
It's a great accomplishment to be named with the best teams of
all-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, has a lineup stocked with
stars, like right fielder Paul O'Neill, but also capable veteran
role players, like Darryl Strawberry, and a pitching staff that
includes the likes of Cone and David Wells, who pitched a perfect
game May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious talent, however, the Yankees seem to possess
a karma; good things happen for them. Orlando Hernandez, the
defector from Cuba who has been a wild success, was promoted to the
big leagues last month only because a Jack Russell terrier
belonging to David Cone's mother bit Cone on the hand, forcing him
to miss a start. On Sunday, the Yankees scored the only run of the
game when Chad Curtis was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have their own little Truman Show,'' said Scott Erickson,
the Baltimore pitcher, referring to the movie about a man who
doesn't know his life is scripted to perfection. ``Everything goes
right for the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch Rickey, the legendary baseball executive, once said that
luck is the residue of design, and this Yankee team resulted from
the evolution of George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Steinbrenner invested heavily in free agents and
traded away his organization's top prospects, and through this
approach, the Yankees eventually were left with an aged team and a
barren farm system. But Steinbrenner placed more emphasis on
developing prospects, and his executives, in turn, concentrated on
scouting the personalities of prospective Yankees, as well as their
talents.
</P>
<P>
   The farm system regenerated and now the Yankees are built around
home-grown players, like shortstop Derek Jeter, center fielder
Bernie Williams and reliever Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Already they had O'Neill and Tino Martinez, great hitters who
seethe with intensity. Before this season, they added Scott
Brosius, a very likeable and highly respected third baseman, who
Torre says maintains his focus from pitch to pitch as well as
anybody he has ever seen, and Chuck Knoblauch, a leadoff hitter who
engages opposing pitchers in a tireless tug-of-war almost every
time he bats. ``I've never seen a team that is as focused as this
one,'' said Steinbrenner, whose teams have won championships in
1977, 1978 and 1996.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``Sesame Street'' producers might consider using the Yankees as
an example of unselfishness. This is cooperation: Joe Girardi, the
regular catcher when the Yankees won the World Series two years
ago, tutors Jorge Posada on a daily basis, even as Posada has
gradually assumed Girardi's playing time. Tim Raines and
Strawberry, superstars when they were younger, are sometimes
removed for pinch-hitters and must share playing time. ``You're
talking about real professionalism,'' Cone said earlier this year.
``Those guys want to play as much as anybody, but what is most
important to them is winning. That's what everybody is all about
here, is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brosius: ``The core of the team is the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said in spring training that to manage this group, he
needed merely to stay out of the way and let them play. He has been
more proactive than that, of course _ he reined in Wells in early
May, pushing him to be more consistent in his approach to
conditioning, and Wells has been nearly unbeatable since.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre has watched the talent, intensity and the
unselfishness translate into success nobody could have envisioned,
despite a myriad of injuries, distractions and odd circumstances.
After opening the season by losing their first three games and four
of their first five, Torre answered questions about whether
Steinbrenner might be inclined to change managers. The Yankees
proceeded to win 22 of their next 24 games, despite losing the
slugger Chili Davis to ankle surgery and their closer, Rivera, for
two weeks with a strained muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Wells pitched his perfect game, the Yankees
played the Orioles for the first time, and after Baltimore's
Armando Benitez hit Martinez with a pitch, the teams engaged in a
frightening brawl. As Torre decried Benitez's act, it was apparent
he was pleased how his players defended each other during the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offense carried the team into early June, batting
.300 through the first 59 games and averaging more than 6.5 runs
per game. But just as Jeter and Williams suffered injuries, the
starting pitching, bolstered by the ascendence of Hernandez and the
improvement of Cone and Wells, became dominant. The Yankees'
starters have a 2.73 earned run average over the last 31 games,
with a 19-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is always that the pitching is intact,'' said
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is expected to rejoin the Yankees later this week,
Davis sometime next month, and there is no sign of let-up from the
pitching. The Yankees already are beyond the hardest part of their
schedule, and 42 of their remaining 81 games are at Yankee Stadium,
where they have won 33 of 39 this season. They could approach 120
victories, an almost unimaginable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But that would only fuel the pressure on the Yankees, as they
pursued their ultimate goal through the playoff land mines and the
World Series. Winning all these games is nice, Girardi said Sunday,
but they would be satisfied winning just one game: The last game
they play, in October.

   NEW ORLEANS _ Delegates at the National Education Association's
convention voted overwhelmingly Sunday against merging with the
American Federation of Teachers, frustrating plans to create a
stronger organization to fight what union leaders see as an
unprecedented assault against public education.
</P>
<P>
   The vote, which would have created the largest union in American
history with 3.3 million members, is a serious blow to the
leadership's designs of creating a unified voice to combat a wave
of critics, most notably supporters of vouchers, a growing movement
to allow use of taxpayer money to help pay for students to attend
private schools.
</P>
<P>
   The merger needed a two-thirds vote for approval. The delegates
stunned the NEA leadership _ and themselves _ by casting only 4,091
votes for the merger, or 42 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging his disappointment, Bob Chase, president of the
2.3 million-member association, said that he would continue pushing
for a merger, although with many details changed, because in his
view his union's members still support the ultimate goal of
unification with the teachers' federation.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference after the vote, Chase, who appeared
dejected and exhausted, said: ``The vast majority of delegates are
in favor of unity. They do want to see the two organizations come
together. Obviously they didn't think this plan was the best way to
do it.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Sandra Feldman, president of the 950,000-member
American Federation of Teachers, said she was disappointed by the
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates gave a host of reasons for rejecting the merger. Many
said that under the agreement, the combined union would be
undemocratic. Others said the teachers' federation was too militant
for their tastes. Many said they did not like the fact that the
merger would make the education association part of the AFL-CIO.
And many said they were happy with the association as it is.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining his vote against merging, Bruce Jensen, an elementary
school teacher in Moulton, Iowa, said: ``The members have taken
great pride in the history, autonomy and independence of the
National Education Association. They were worried that this would
reduce its independence.''
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, opponents of the merger had predicted that they
might block it by obtaining 40 percent of the vote. On Sunday, many
opponents acknowledged they were shocked when they got far more
than 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Chase said that notwithstanding the vote, he would continue with
policies under which the union has shifted away from its
us-vs.-them emphasis on wages and benefits and toward a focus on
working with school districts to improve education.

</P>
<P>
   At the convention on Monday, the nearly 10,000 delegates will
consider whether to authorize renewed negotiations with the
federation to produce a merger agreement more to their liking.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Krimmel, a supporter of the merger who teaches special
education in Holland, Pa., said: ``We've suffered a blow, but not a
fatal blow. Just as teachers ask, `How can students learn if they
don't have a full stomach and a safe environment?' I don't know how
we as educators can battle foes of public education if we're still
fighting against ourselves. I still hope we'll unify eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Many delegates objected to specific parts of the merger
document, known as the Principles of Unity.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent criticism was that the new organization would be less
democratic than the NEA because the dominant body would be a
37-member executive board. Many delegates said this showed that the
teachers' federation had emerged victorious in the merger
negotiations, because the governing structure would be more like
that of the heavily centralized federation than like that of the
bottom-up NEA, where the 10,000-delegate assembly dominates.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why many Massachusetts delegates voted no, Kenneth
Hamilton, president of the Newton Teachers Association, said, ``The
organization spelled out in the Principles of Unity was less
democratic, less grass-roots than the NEA and more of a top-down
leadership organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Hamilton said he would support a renewed push to
negotiate a merger. But, he added: ``It has to have the new
organization look more like the NEA than the AFT. This document was
just the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   The education association was founded in 1857 as a professional
organization, and for more than a century it shunned collective
bargaining. But when the teachers' federation used strikes and
militancy to win far better wages and benefits in the 1960s and
1970s, the NEA transformed itself into a union that also emphasized
wages and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's vote follows three decades of on-again, off-again
efforts to merge the two unions. For decades they were archrivals,
badmouthing each other, raiding each other's locals for members,
and spending more than $100 million in seeking to outdo each other
in wooing teachers from hundreds of school districts across the
nation. The association has been the dominant union in suburban and
rural school districts, while the federation dominates in cities.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, however, the unions have signed a nonaggression
pact, pledging not to raid each other and agreeing to discuss a
merger. In February, negotiators for the two unions announced the
merger plan, which was largely made possible by the education
association easing its long-time opposition to joining the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   But for many members, becoming part of the AFL-CIO remained a
major sticking point. A number of them said that joining would
reduce their independence and force them to focus on issues other
than education, because most of the labor federation's members are
not teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Many members voiced discomfort with joining the labor federation
because they saw it as blue-collar and confrontational, even though
47 percent of its members are white-collar workers.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman Woods, a vocational educational teacher in Millport,
Ala., who voted against the merger, said: ``We'd go along with it
if there wasn't affiliation with the AFL-CIO. It's the unionization
part. We don't consider ourselves a union. We're not into the
boycotting and rioting. We generally associate that with unions.''
</P>
<P>
   In her statement, Ms. Feldman, the teacher federation's
president, said that four years of merger talks had helped the two
groups recognize that they have much in common.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both organizations share the goals of improving education for
America's 50 million students, fighting for the dignity and
well-being of the nation's educators, and of course putting an end
to vouchers and other privatization attempts that can't possibly
succeed for the majority of our students,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Conservative critics of the teachers' unions applauded Sunday's
vote after many had denounced the proposed merger, partly because
it would produce a more potent teachers' organization.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Fossedal, chairman of the the Alexis de Tocqueville
Institution, a public policy center that supports school vouchers,
said, ``Today's vote to preserve at least some choice and
competition is a victory for teachers, parents and children.''
</P>
<P>
   But Chase said the NEA's foes were wrong to applaud the vote and
insisted that the two teachers' groups would continue their close
cooperation on many issues, like school funding and fighting
vouchers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there are people out there who opposed this and take
comfort in this, I think their comfort will be misplaced,'' he
said.

NEW SMOKING TRIAL TESTS INDUSTRY'S RESOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The resolve of cigarette makers to fight lawsuits following the
collapse of last year's nationwide settlement plan faces its
toughest test Monday with the start of a large class-action case
brought on behalf of smokers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The case, in which an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people are
seeking some $25 billion in compensatory and punitive damages, is
the nation's first class-action lawsuit involving smokers to come
to trial. Jury selection will begin Monday and is expected to take
three to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will unfold in stages, with the first one determining
whether producers are liable for tobacco-related health problems
and should face punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The case comes at an uncertain point in the course of tobacco
litigation. Last month, in a rare victory for plaintiffs, a Florida
jury ordered Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. to pay $1 million,
including $500,000 in punitive damages, to the family of a smoker.
But just days later, a Florida appeals court struck down a 1996
jury award of $750,000 against Brown &AMP; Williamson, holding that the
smoker in that case had waited too long to sue and that evidence
had been improperly admitted at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sugarman, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley and an expert on tobacco litigation, said he
believed that the trial's first phase would be critical. The
industry will try to knock out the case, he said, and if that
fails, it will move to settle it, despite recent tough talk against
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the plaintiffs must hope that if they can win Round 1
then the industry will come to the bargaining table,'' Sugarman
said.
</P>
<P>
   If jurors hold producers liable, and there is no settlement, the
jury will next hear the cases of six smokers representing the
class. In the third stage, the claim of each class member will be
reviewed to see whether their illness was smoking-related.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Rosenblatt, the Miami lawyer who brought the lawsuit,
estimated the number of class members at 100,000 to 200,000. And
legal experts like Sugarman said that a case-by-case review of
those claims would be so cumbersome that producers would be likely
to settle if the case proved unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, no one is talking about settling. Robert C. Heim, a
lawyer for Philip Morris, said that tobacco producers planned to
stake their defense on data showing that the public was aware of
smoking risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are dealing with the issue of personal choice and
responsibility,'' Heim said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that the industry knowingly addicted smokers and
then failed to adequately warn them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thrust of our case is that the tobacco industry attempted
through diversionary tactics to keep alive a nonexistent scientific
controversy about smoking and health,'' Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   He is no stranger to the tobacco industry. Last year, he and his
wife, Susan, who is also a lawyer, scored a major victory when
producers agreed to pay $300 million to settle a lawsuit brought on
behalf of 60,000 flight attendants who had claimed injury from
secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But the case also generated some disputes. Alan Morrison, a
lawyer with Public Citizen, an advocacy group, said that his group
objected to the settlement on behalf of some flight attendants
because its financial benefits went to establish a nonprofit
foundation to research smoking-related diseases rather than to
class members. And he described as excessive the $49 million in
fees and expenses paid under the settlement to the Rosenblatts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obviously able to persuade the tobacco industry to part
with over $350 million and for that I give him great credit,''
Morrison said. ``But our problem is that the money did not go to
the class.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Judge Robert Kaye, who oversaw the flight attendant
case and was assigned to handle the new lawsuit, backed the
settlement. And Rosenblatt, who said he could not discuss the
matter because it was under appeal, said that flight attendants did
not show up at a recent court hearing to object to the settlement
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff in the current case is Dr. Howard Engle, a
retired pediatrician in Miami Beach who filed suit in 1994.

GET IN THAT KITCHEN AND PREPARE TO BLAST OFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   So you've got three pots steaming over here and five dirty bowls
in the sink over there, and the person who shares your bed and
board strolls into the kitchen, surveys the situation and comments:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, you're making this meal look very complicated. After all,
this isn't rocket science.''
</P>
<P>
   Right, it isn't. Cooking is more complicated than rocket
science.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to take my word for it. Ask Jay McCarthy. He
studied aerospace engineering at Texas A&AMP;M and worked in the
industry, including a short stint at The Boeing Co. He lived in the
Seattle area, did some cooking in his spare time, shopped for local
produce at the Pike Place Market and ate at Ray's Boathouse when he
could afford a good meal.
</P>
<P>
   He is now one of the hottest chefs in Texas. He started his own
cafe, Mestana, in San Antonio and it has been so successful he has
plans for another.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never regretted the career change for a minute,''
McCarthy commented when we crossed paths a couple of months ago.
``Every day is a challenge. And believe me, there are as many
details you have to deal with in the restaurant business as in
aerospace engineering. And I once ran a machine shop and turned out
probes for the Martian atmosphere.''
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm. I once cooked bouillabaisse for 35 people in a strange
kitchen on two electric burners. And they all wanted to eat at
once. From what McCarthy says, there can't be much more pressure
than that in the planning, development and construction of a
booster rocket.
</P>
<P>
   Yet McCarthy's enthusiasm is barely dimmed by the facts of his
profession. He admitted under questioning that his work day begins
sometime between 6 and 8 a.m. and rarely ends before 11:30 p.m.,
six days a week. If he were working at Boeing, the company would
owe him two 737s, just in overtime pay.
</P>
<P>
   Here is one of McCarthy's favorite recipes:
</P>
<P>
   Beef Tostada
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup beef cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup diced tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup corn kernels
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup black beans, drained
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup Monterey jack cheese, shredded
</P>
<P>
   Peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Flour tortillas or fry bread
</P>
<P>
   Multiply the above ingredients by the total number of guests.
</P>
<P>
   Use a good grade of top round or tenderloin beef and cut into
small cubes, no bigger than one-half inch.
</P>
<P>
   Just so this recipe doesn't get as simple as rocket science,
McCarthy prefers to serve each tostada portion over a freshly
cooked, five-inch circle of Indian fry bread rather than the
traditional warmed tortilla. (I know, you flunked physics, so you
are going to opt for the tortilla rather than the more complicated
fry bread. Me too.)
</P>
<P>
   Heat a skillet over medium high heat. Add a bit of peanut oil
and sear beef cubes. Add the garlic and saute 3 to 4 minutes more.
Add the tomatoes, corn and black beans and heat through. Place a
tortilla or a round of fry bread on each plate. Add cheese on top
and heat each dish in a 200-degree oven until melted.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy was born in New York and raised in Jamaica, but he has
cooked in all parts of the country and specializes in what he terms
``Caribbean Rim Cuisine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Intermediate Eater specializes in Three Alarm Chili, spicy
chicken wings, tuna casseroles and Son of a Gun Stew, but sometimes
I will spread my wings and fly with something like this Asian
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese Lemon Chicken
</P>
<P>
   Canola oil
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon sherry
</P>
<P>
   Salt, freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   4 boned chicken breasts
</P>
<P>
   Cornstarch
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons catsup
</P>
<P>
   Juice of one large lemon
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup sliced green onions
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup carrots, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds cup snow peas
</P>
<P>
   One-half cup sliced water chestnuts
</P>
<P>
   One-and-one-half cups fresh mushrooms
</P>
<P>
   Pound the chicken breasts (skinned or unskinned) with a Ming
dynasty baseball bat until one-half inch thick.
</P>
<P>
   OK, moosh together 1 tablespoon of canola oil, 2 teaspoons of
soy sauce, the sherry and some freshly ground pepper. Rub this into
the chicken, then lightly coat the breasts with cornstarch.
Refrigerate at least 30 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Then you are supposed to construct some lemon sauce, combining
in a saucepan } cup water, the sugar, catsup, lemon juice, 1
teaspoon oil and a dash of salt. Bring to a boil, stirring. Mix 2
teaspoons of cornstarch with a bit of water and stir this paste
into the sauce. Stir until thickened, then keep sauce over a low
heat.
</P>
<P>
   Coat a skillet with enough canola oil to cover the bottom and
brown the chicken breasts on both sides. Remove to a board and cut
the chicken into strips, three-quarters inch wide. Keep warm.
</P>
<P>
   To the same oiled skillet add the vegetables and stir-fry until
tender but still crisp. Dump this mess on a warm platter. Top with
the chicken, then spoon the sauce over all. If you want to go first
class, scatter toasted almond slices over the top. This will serve
four with rice, and if that doesn't taste better than NASA rations,
then John Glenn is a rickshaw driver in El Paso.

 &HT;    Braves Notebook: Bumped umpires will hand over decision to NL
president
 &HT;    by Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Though his office may not address the issue until
after the All-Star break, the conclusion of Sunday's Braves-Mets
game is headed for the desk of National League president Len
Coleman, who is certain to discipline the New York Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Both crew chief Randy Marsh and plate umpire Angel Hernandez
were bumped in what became a Mets team meeting around the crew
after Hernandez's game-ending call Sunday. Manager Bobby Valentine
and reliever John Franco both face suspensions and Franco, who had
contact with both umpires, could face a week or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we do is file a report with Len Coleman with the league,''
said Marsh, who spoke on behalf of the crew. ``We do not recommend
fines. We have no say-so in that. I'm sure he'll review the tapes.
There was contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Marsh backed up Hernandez's call, which the crew was able to
review on tape immediately afterwards. Hernandez declined to speak
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if there was a bobble there, but looking at the
tape, it looked like (Mike) Piazza was bending over, trying to
smother it,'' said Marsh. ``But the bottom line is, (Michael
Tucker) got his foot down in there before he was even doing that,
before he put the tag on him.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost....
</P>
<P>
   Missed it by that much. Braves starter Denny Neagle gave up the
two Mets runs in the sixth that tied the game and did not play into
the decision. That left Neagle at 9-6 and just one win shy of some
history. With Greg Maddux (12-2), Tom Glavine (12-3) and Kevin
Millwood (10-4) all with double-digit victories, Neagle could have
comprised the first rotation in 21 years with 10 or more each at
the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   No NL team since the 1977 Los Angeles Dodgers had four starters
with 10 or more wins at the break. Said manager Bobby Cox,
``Neagle's going to get over-looked. He's had a great first-half.
His numbers are just as close. For me, he's popping the ball
super.''
</P>
<P>
   The '77 Dodgers reached the break with Doug Rau at 11-1, Tommy
John at 10-4, Rick Rhoden at 10-6 and Don Sutton at 10-4. ``I'd
forgotten about that,'' Sutton said. ``Maybe because it's because I
went 4-4 in the second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching plans
</P>
<P>
   The match-ups for the Florida series and note both All-Stars
Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine will have eight days between starts:
(Thursday) John Smoltz (5-2) vs. Livan Hernandez (7-4); (Friday)
Denny Neagle (9-6) vs. Jesus Sanchez (3-6); (Saturday) Maddux
(12-2) vs. Ryan Dempster (1-3); (Sunday) Glavine (12-3) vs. Brian
Meadows (6-6).
</P>
<P>
   Etc.
</P>
<P>
   When Neagle was called for a balk when throwing over to first in
the sixth inning, it marked the club's first balk of the year,
coming in the 782nd inning of the season. The Braves hold the NL
record for fewest balks in a season (0), set in 1948 in Boston and
then tied in 1957 in Milwaukee. . . Surprisingly, Piazza was back
in the lineup after taking a bat to the head Saturday night on a
swing by Gerald Williams. Piazza was groggy when he returned to the
Mets clubhouse late from tests at Piedmont Hospital but was back
out on the field 13 hours later, but equipped with the helmet-style
catcher's mask. . . . Sunday's attendance of 40,430 extended to 13
straight games the string of 40,000-plus crowds (home and road) to
see the Braves play. The last such attendance streak was 16 games
and came before the last players' strike (June 13-29, 1994). . . .
Pedro Borbon, 0-2 with a 5.54 ERA on a re-han assignment with Class
AA Greenville, has that assignment extended another 15 days through
July 18. A team may extend re-hab assignments indefinitely, as long
as both parties agree to the extension. Borbon has allowed eight
earned runs on 14 hits in 13 innings, walking 12 and striking out
four.

 &HT;    18-hole playoff will decide U.S. Women's Open winner
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ After four days watching the field being battered
and windblown by Blackwolf Run Golf Course, what could be more
fitting as a conclusion for the U.S. Women's Open?
</P>
<P>
   Overtime, of course. No reason to stop the torture. Surely,
there are more bogeys out there amongst the wild fescue, even on a
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The tournament was handed a sudden change of plans Sunday
afternoon. Just when it appeared that Korea's Se Ri Pak had a firm
grip on a second major championship, Duke University junior Jenny
Chuasiriporn decided to provide a dramatic reminder of the United
States Golf Association's antiquated playoff system.
</P>
<P>
   Getting the line from her brother and caddie, Mike, Chuasiriporn
aimed a foot to the left, made solid contact and watched bug-eyed
as a 45-foot putt found the center of the cup at the 18th hole
Sunday for birdie. When Pak, who had taken a two-shot lead to the
17th tee, bogeyed the hole and then missed a 10-foot birdie putt at
18, the two players wound up tied at 6-over-par 290, forcing an
18-hole playoff beginning today at 11 a.m. (CDT).
</P>
<P>
   ''It was on line for about 10 feet,'' said Chuasiriporn, a
Baltimore, Md., native whose parents are from Thailand, ''and I
thought, 'My God, it might be going in.' The last 15 feet, my eyes
probably popped out. I really didn't expect it to go in. I was
thinking 2-putt.''
</P>
<P>
   The two 20-year-olds would have just as soon headed to a sudden
death playoff, but the USGA remains the only golf organization that
decides its championships by an 18-hole playoff. Which, history has
proven, often is sudden death for TV ratings.
</P>
<P>
   As an added problem, there is rain in the forecast for today.
</P>
<P>
   The 72-hole score of 6-over posted by the two players was the
highest since Jan Stephenson won the tournament in 1983. The last
Women's Open playoff came in 1992, when Patti Sheehan defeated Juli
Inkster.
</P>
<P>
   One already settled issue is the money. With Chuasiriporn an
amateur, the winner's check of $267,000 will go to Pak.
</P>
<P>
   Pak, who bogeyed the 17th hole by missing the green and then a
4-foot putt, shot a 76. She was still smiling, seemed not the least
bit disappointed and envisioned a playoff that will ''feel like a
practice round.''
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn actually was unaware of Pak's bogey at the 17th and
thought the Korean could two-putt for the win.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm just going out to have fun,'' the amateur said of the
playoff. ''I have nothing to lose from here on out.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweden's Liselotte Neumann, a shot off the lead after 54 holes,
finished third at 291 on a 76. Scotland's Mhairi McKay slipped to a
78 and tied for seventh.

ANALYSIS: IN SEARCH OF CHINA'S GORBACHEV 
</HEADLINE>
  (jw) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, on his trip to China, seemed to
think that he had found his Gorbachev in President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, Jiang is more likely to be China's Brezhnev _
one of the last leaders of the old Communist regime, far more
interested in shoring up the party's monopoly over political power
than in dismantling it.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign policy analysts and even many of Clinton's Republican
opponents consider this to have been a very successful trip, even
though Clinton, in his characteristic effort to empathize with
whomever he meets, had some extraordinary words of praise for Jiang
that cut against the grain of the Chinese leader's record and
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   But many of these analysts say that Clinton went too far, even
with the usual discount for courtesies allowed a president
operating on foreign soil. They say that neither Jiang nor the
Chinese Communist Party give any indication of a willingness to
change the late Deng Xiaoping's mantra of economic reform as
necessarily preceding political reform. Nor was there any deviation
from the imperative of single-party government.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called China's course of economic reform and modest
increases in personal liberty ``morally right.'' And in his closing
press conference in Hong Kong on Friday, Clinton lauded Jiang, a
71-year-old, Soviet-trained engineer and apparatchik, as a man of
``imagination,'' ``extraordinary intellect'' and ``very high
energy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Profoundly important at this moment in our history when there
is so much change going on, he has a good imagination _ he has
vision,'' Clinton said. ``He can imagine a future that is different
from the present.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also praised Prime Minister Zhu Rongji, an economic
reformer, saying: ``There's a very good chance that China has the
right leadership at the right time.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are less convinced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe Jiang has whispered some great secret into Clinton's
ears,'' said Peter Rodman, a former Nixon and Reagan administration
official now at the Nixon Center. ``But I think he's wildly
overstating how far this regime is willing to go. Something is
opening up in China, and there is more political ferment, but Jiang
is a transitional figure. Jiang does not intend the future outcome
for which Clinton is already praising him.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Kagan, a critic of Clinton's China policy at the Carnegie
Endowment, says there is too much wishful thinking in Clinton's
words. ``Clinton declaring Jiang as a reformer and a democrat
doesn't make it so,'' Kagan said. ``Have we gone back to believing
in reform Communism? The Chinese don't believe in it; why should
we?''
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese world view, Kagan and Rodman agree, has been shaped
by events of 1989 _ within China, with the military crackdown on
democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, and in the Soviet
Union, where President Mikhail Gorbachev destroyed the Communist
Party by trying to reform it and, in the process, lost the Soviet
empire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jiang and the whole party have gone to school on Gorbachev''
as an object lesson, said Rodman. ``Gorbachev's delusion was that a
benign form of Communism would be popular in a more pluralist
system, and he took away the coercion. But when you take away the
coercion, people want the real thing, which is freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Haass, foreign-policy director of the Brookings
Institution, gives Clinton good marks for coating his message in
honey.
</P>
<P>
   ``His personal support for Jiang is consistent with the posture
of encouraging reform, of saying not, `Tear down this wall, Mr.
Gorbachev,' as Reagan did, but very much, `We are with you, not
against you,' '' Haass said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Clinton's words, the Chinese model is clear: ``economic
reform first, then political reform as it comes,'' Haass said. So
when Clinton eloquently recites the American position, that
political reform needs to precede economic reform and is required
for that reform to take root, ``the Chinese just smile politely and
will continue to go their way.''
</P>
<P>
   The important moment, Haass said, is still some time off in the
future, ``when economic reform requires more political loosening
than the political leadership is prepared to provide or to give
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Jendrzejczyk, Washington director for Human Rights Watch,
said that Clinton ``undermined a successful trip at the end by
overselling.'' In Jendrzejczyk's view, ``neither side budged an
inch, especially on human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a degree of wishful thinking upsetting to those who
want a good relationship with China,'' Jendrzejczyk said. ``Clinton
was there to negotiate as well as communicate, and whether the
results justify the praise of Jiang and the endorsement of him as
the man who will bring democracy to China is another question.
There doesn't seem to be anything to base it on.''
</P>
<P>
   The real import of the trip is domestic, said Haass. ``Clinton
made an effort to win back control of the domestic debate on
China,'' he said. ``This will buy him some time. But the real test
for the future is less what happens in China than what happens
here. A lot of the praise for him is temporary, and grudging.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is already being accused of a form of moral relativism.
While no one expects him to adopt the simple moral shorthand of
President Reagan, who called the Soviet Union an ``evil empire,''
Clinton's tactic of listing American shortcomings while criticizing
Chinese human-rights violations grated on numerous ears, Rodman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton does it whether he's in a town meeting in Detroit or
Beijing,'' Haass said. ``But done in China, there is a degree of
equivalence in that message that I find borderline offensive.
Whatever our offenses, they are tiny in comparison.''

 &HT;    Georgia, Florida National Guards combine to battle fires
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL, Fla. _ The Blackhawk UH-60s crews dive toward the
flames and empty 660-gallon buckets of water about 30 feet above
the trees, trying to slow a blaze burning relentlessly Sunday
toward subdivisions in Flagler County, where thousands of people
have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The two helicopters then circle around to Crescent Lake and dip
out another load. It's a task they repeat again and again, making
up to 40 fire attacks an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say this is about as hazardous as it gets,'' said Staff
Sgt. Timothy Loveless, a Georgia National Guard crew chief who
hangs out of the helicopter on approach to eyeball the water drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tree exploded under me and all I could see was fire. I
thought my feet were on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveless and 26 fellow Georgians are members of the Guard's
171st Aviation Battalion, which is made up of Georgia and Florida
units. They've been flying out of St. Augustine since June 27,
fighting the wildfires ravaging Florida, after fighting fires in
Waycross, Ga., for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the National Guard is all about,'' said Brig.
Gen. Tom McCullough of metro Atlanta, who toured the devastated
stretch of northeast Florida by air Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a mission like this, they go home and morale is high
because they feel like they've helped people.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard officials have informally named the helicopter mission
``Operation Wetdown.'' Acres of blackened landscape are visible
from the air, but for the most part, the burned land is surrounded
by oceans of green where the flames haven't penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   An east wind had given the firefighters an advantage by slowing
the fires' advance and allowed crews to contain them. Yet black
smoke billowed from a hot fire 13 miles west of Bunnell while white
smoke rose from smoldering pine needles and palmetto, and a shift
in the wind or a pickup in gusts could easily turn the
``contained'' acres into another firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a bed of pine needles built up over the years and it's
just like gasoline,'' said Staff Sgt. Nicholas Cox, a crew chief
from Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Brock Gaston of Marietta, Ga. pointed to areas where the
helicopter crews had been dumping loads over Flagler County, which
Gov. Lawton Chiles ordered evacuated Friday when authorities feared
three fires would converge, creating a firestorm that might make it
impossible for the county's 40,000 residents to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we've been working,'' Gaston told the general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as a small fire and we were able to keep it off
of the houses. Then two days later we lost all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The crews refill their huge buckets _ which dangle on 15-foot
cables below the choppers _ from the St. Johns River and the lakes
and ponds dotting the region. They use the closest body of water
because time is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few ponds over here we just emptied out getting
water to throw on those fires,'' Gaston said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crews rarely manage to put out a fire _ ground
crews have to extinguish them _ but aim to control the fast-moving
wildfires. Each day brings a new threat that a lightning strike or
spark will generate a new fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to slow it down so that the tractors and
bulldozers can cut a fire break through the trees,'' said Sgt.
Phillip Banzhof, a crew chief from Cumming, just north of Atlanta.
``Some of the areas you can't get in because it's so hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said putting a bucket on these fires is like spitting
on a campfire,'' said Staff Sgt. Michael Callanan, also of Cumming.
</P>
<P>
   The crew chiefs guide the pilots over the fires, and the
Blackhawks disappear into the smoke as they aim to dump the loads
of water and foam 30 feet above the trees. Sometimes the smoke is
so thick that it forces them higher because of the risk of getting
tangled in trees and power lines, and that decreases their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to see the fire _ if we hang a bucket up in
those trees it could be disastrous,'' said Chief Warrant Officer
Kevin Zemetis of Marietta, a helicopter pilot. ``Besides snagging
power lines or trees, the next biggest hazard is dropping 5,600
pounds of water on firefighters on the ground. Three tons of water
landing on somebody could hurt them pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the helicopter crews have been hurt and the
firefighters on the ground have suffered only minor injuries _
except for one who was seriously injured Sunday when a tree fell on
his bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   The crews take their orders from the Florida Division of
Forestry in Tallahassee, which has expertise in fighting fires, and
from a ranger in an observation helicopter. Sometimes the experts
make mistakes. In one instance last week, the guardsmen spotted a
plume of smoke and radioed to ask if they should water it and were
told it didn't pose a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one that turned into an inferno,'' Loveless said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gaston's crew spotted a plume of smoke in St. Johns
County during a mop-up mission and radioed for instructions, they
were given the go-ahead to extinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to kill it before it got started,'' Gaston said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the one silver lining in the dark clouds of smoke over
Florida is that the disaster provides excellent _ and federally
financed _ training for the aviation battalion's wartime mission of
hauling equipment into combat zones, said Col. Art Bruno, who is
director of operation for the battalion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this a high-hazard mission,'' said Bruno, of
Ellenwood, Ga. ``In our wartime mission, we do a lot of
sling-loading. Sling-loading 600 gallons of water is similar to
sling-loading a humvee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida unit has six Blackhawks and the Georgia unit has
five, along with two observation helicopters and a Chinook. The
Blackhawks can be flown only 500 hours before being grounded for
maintenance for 25 days. Florida lost one to maintenance last week
and is about ready to lose another. Georgia has a couple that are
soon to be grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that if you fly them this much, you can't do
the maintenance and so you have to ground them,'' Bruno said.

CROATIA AND ITS FORTUNATE SONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JERE LONGMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST.-JEAN D'ARDIERES, France _ Five hours before Saturday's
stunning 3-0 victory over Germany in the World Cup, the flamboyant
coach of Croatia received a two-page fax here at the team's chateau
in the Beaujolais wine region. Miroslav Blazevic has a fondness for
cigarettes, chocolates, watermelon and astrology. The fax came from
his astrologer in Zagreb, Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I only read to him the most positive sentences,'' said Darko
Tironi, the team's press officer. ``It said Berti Vogts and the
German 11 were going to have big problems.''
</P>
<P>
   That they were. Forty minutes into the game, German defender
Christian Woerns was given a red card and ejected for a late
tackle. Vogts stood helplessly on the bench while his team was
shredded by a Croatian counterattack. Croatia will now try to
outmuscle France in the semifinals on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia gained its independence from Yugoslavia only seven years
ago and is participating in its first World Cup, yet the country
with a mere 4.7 million residents has now joined traditional powers
France, Brazil and the Netherlands as one of the four remaining
teams with a chance to win soccer's world championship. Not since
Portugal in 1966 has a team advanced this far in its first
appearance in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   A perfect sports weekend for Croatia was spoiled Sunday when
Goran Ivanisevic lost to Pete Sampras for the Wimbledon tennis
championship. Still, soccer is alive. Saturday's victory over
Germany ranks among the great athletic achievements in the
fledgling Balkan nation. Those highlights include a gold medal in
team handball at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, a silver
medal in basketball provided by Toni Kukoc and Dino Radja at the
1992 Barcelona Games and the 1997 women's tennis title won by Iva
Majoli at the French Open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four million people is a small town in the United States,''
said the midfielder Aljosa Asanovic, who can be forgiven for his
hyperbole. ``But my country gives a very big result. Small country,
big players, very big players.''
</P>
<P>
   Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia and a huge soccer fan,
had lunch with the team here before Saturday's match 30 miles to
the south in Lyons. ``He put the pressure off,'' defender Slaven
Bilic said. ``He said we're already knights of Croatia.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Tudjman visited the team in its locker room and,
giddy with victory, told the players that they could make it to
next Sunday's championship game. ``He was like a little child,''
Bilic said.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia is a team with great confidence, rough strength, a
compact defense that has allowed only two goals in five matches and
a prideful nationalism forged from its war of independence from
Yugoslavia. Petar Krpan, a substitute forward, fought against
Serbian forces in a conflict that began with intense fighting in
1991 and continued sporadically until 1995 and took 20,000 Croatian
lives. Asanovic said two close friends died. Igor Stimac, a
defender, said his brother served in a triage unit.
</P>
<P>
   The soccer players continued to play their sport during the war,
some inside Croatia, others outside. It was to show the Serbs,
Stimac said, ``that football was still alive, that we were still
alive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are much stronger now on the field after what we've
been through,'' Stimac said. ``There is nothing to be afraid of now
on the green pitch.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Croats are far from soccer rookies. Croats played on the
1948 and 1956 Yugoslav Olympic soccer teams that won silver medals
and the 1960 team that took gold. Five members of the current team
played on Yugoslavia's world champion under-20 team in 1987, and
four members played for Yugoslavia in the 1990 World Cup. Robert
Prosinecki, a midfielder, has the distinction of having scored for
Yugoslavia in 1990 and for Croatia in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Croats now pollinate the top European leagues of Italy, Spain,
Germany and England. Davor Suker, who has four goals in the World
Cup and is one of the world's top forwards, plays for Real Madrid,
the 1998 European Cup champion. Injured forward Alen Boksic helped
Juventus win the Italian League in 1997 and now plays for Lazio.
</P>
<P>
   Zvonimir Boban, now of A.C. Milan, became the spiritual leader
of the Croatian team on May 13, 1990, during a Yugoslav League
match between the Croat-supported Dynamo Zagreb and the
Serb-supported Red Star Belgrade. When fans began fighting, Boban
ran up and kicked a Yugoslav police officer who had raised a
truncheon at a Croatian fan, according to Croatian journalists who
said they had witnessed the incident. Boban lost his chance to
participate in the 1990 World Cup for a united Yugoslavia, but he
became a national hero to the Croats.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had wanted independence for 50 years,'' Bilic said. ``It
was a very important sign. We said, `That's enough.'''
</P>
<P>
   Croatia became independent in 1991, too late for qualifying for
the 1994 World Cup. Yugoslavia was banned from the 1994 World Cup
because of international sanctions related to the Bosnian conflict.
Croatia entered its first major international soccer competition at
the 1996 European Championships, where it lost its cool and its
chance to beat Germany in the quarterfinals. Saturday night, a more
mature Croatian team exacted sweet revenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before, we had just come out of the war and we were like
soldiers on the pitch, making our country recognized,'' said Bilic,
who plays for Everton in the English Premier League and intends to
become an attorney. ``We're still doing that, but thank God now we
are a normal country. It takes the pressure off. It should be down
to pure football.''
</P>
<P>
   Guiding this dark-horse team is its eccentric 63-year-old coach,
Blazevic, who resembles a wizened Dustin Hoffman. He favored
wearing a white scarf when he coached Dynamo Zagreb in the early
1980s, and is now carrying around a gendarme's hat as a sign of
respect for the French police officer who was put into a coma by
German soccer hooligans earlier in the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic previously coached Nantes in the French League, and his
reputation was sullied in 1995 when he was jailed for two weeks
after being implicated in a match-rigging scandal involving the
former European Cup champion, Olympic Marseilles. Blazevic was
released without charges being filed.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the French think, the Croats believe Blazevic is the
perfect coach, a man who knows what to say and what not to say, a
fervent nationalist who has provided the togetherness, the
motivation and resilience.
</P>
<P>
   Blazevic has been telling his players since the 1996 European
Championships that they were the best in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We laughed before, like it was a joke,'' Bilic said. ``Now we
are not laughing. We are not saying we are the best. But we deserve
to be in the last four. We have every reason to say we have a
chance.''

   NEW YORK _ The Boston Globe's investigation of Patricia Smith,
the columnist who resigned last month after it was discovered that
she invented some of the people she described, has produced
evidence that her fabrications might be far more numerous than
originally reported.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the four columns that Ms. Smith acknowledged had
fabrications, 20 columns written since January 1996 mention people
whose identities cannot be documented, The Globe's editor, Matthew
Storin, said in a message to readers published Tuesday in The
Globe, which is owned by The New York Times Co.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith, who was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize this year,
will be asked to help review those columns and 28 columns from 1995
that have also been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Storin said Sunday that Ms. Smith's editors started a review of
her columns in 1995 because of doubts about an interview with a man
from Somerville, Mass., whose words too patly echoed political
commentary about the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little too polished, a little too
Washingtonesque,'' Storin said.
</P>
<P>
   Storin wrote a letter on June 25 to members of the Pulitzer
board explaining why he nominated Ms. Smith's work for the award
despite the red flags. ``In the first week of 1996,'' he wrote, ``I
spoke with Patricia about concerns over some of the people she was
quoting.'' He did not ask whether she was fabricating because ``I
thought it was possible she did not understand the `rules of the
road' for columns like hers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had complete confidence that she got the message,'' he
wrote. ``To the charge of unjustified ignorance or naivete, I plead
guilty,'' he added, apologizing ``for any embarrassment this has
brought the Pulitzer selection process.'' &QL;

<P>
   Ms. Smith, who was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize this year,
will be asked to help review those columns and 28 columns from 1995
that have also been questioned.
</P>
<P>
   Storin said Sunday that Ms. Smith's editors started a review of
her columns in 1995 because of doubts about an interview with a man
from Somerville, Mass., whose words too patly echoed political
commentary about the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were a little too polished, a little too
Washingtonesque,'' Storin said.
</P>
<P>
   Storin wrote a letter on June 25 to members of the Pulitzer
board explaining why he nominated Ms. Smith's work for the award
despite the red flags. ``In the first week of 1996,'' he wrote, ``I
spoke with Patricia about concerns over some of the people she was
quoting.'' He did not ask whether she was fabricating because ``I
thought it was possible she did not understand the `rules of the
road' for columns like hers.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had complete confidence that she got the message,'' he
wrote. ``To the charge of unjustified ignorance or naivete, I plead
guilty,'' he added, apologizing ``for any embarrassment this has
brought the Pulitzer selection process.'' &QL;

TALENTED LOPEZ IS READY AND WAITING
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ It looks like a fight between Felix Trinidad and
Ike Quartey is all but set for later this year.
</P>
<P>
   And every welterweight in the world wants a piece of Oscar De La
Hoya, which means the winner of Trinidad-Quartey could end up in
the ring with De La Hoya next year.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, the fighter who seems to be left out of the
immediate mix might be the best of all: Jose Luis Lopez. For what
it's worth, De La Hoya himself said Lopez would give him his
toughest fight.
</P>
<P>
   If your reaction is ``Jose Luis Who?'' you're not alone. Lopez,
another in a never-ending stream of capable fighters from Mexico,
is the least known of the group.
</P>
<P>
   In part, that can be attributed to the fact he began fighting in
the U.S. less than two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   However, he won't be overlooked for long.
</P>
<P>
   One, his performances have established him as a legitimate _
perhaps (begin ital)the(end ital) legitimate _ heir to Julio Cesar
Chavez.
</P>
<P>
   And, two, he recently signed a promotional contract with Main
Events. He now has a powerful machine behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm not the most recognized fighter. I think I have the
qualities to be a (great fighter), though,'' he said through an
interpreter.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez, 25, has a solid technical background. He was raised in
the gym: His father and trainer, Jose Luis Lopez Sr., was a
bantamweight contender in the 1960s and '70s.
</P>
<P>
   And he has an innate fighting spirit that is frightening. He has
the will and ferocity of a young Chavez but can punch harder. Like
a missile with gloves on, he locks onto his target and just keeps
coming, an endearing quality to action-starved fans.
</P>
<P>
   If Lopez proves to be as durable as Chavez _ and so far, he has
_ he might emerge as one of the great fighters of his era.
</P>
<P>
   In his best performance, he drew with WBA welterweight champion
Quartey last October.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez (41-3-2, 32 knockouts) had some trouble with Quartey's
speed but ultimately did what some believed no one could: He made
the Ghanan look human, knocking him down and forever altering his
imposing image.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez has his problems. He has a wild side.
</P>
<P>
   After annihilating Luis ``Yory Boy'' Campas to retain his NABF
title in 1996, he was stripped of the title after he tested
positive for marijuana. That's an image that doesn't fade away.
</P>
<P>
   And he tends to lose focus. Before the Quartey fight, his
manager sent him all the way to England to train to keep him away
from distractions at home in Durango, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   However, he seems to be determined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be like Julio Cesar Chavez,'' he said. ``I don't
want to have the same (legal) problems he's having now. I just want
to be known as a good fighter, a good champion like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, he wants De La Hoya and the money and fame that goes
along with him.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Lopez, again, it looks as if he'll have to
wait in line and build his reputation in the meantime. He seems
willing to fight anyone to build his name recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Arum, De La Hoya's promoter, said Lopez's relative anonymity
would make it difficult to sell a De La Hoya-Lopez fight, and
there's some truth to that. At the same time, Arum undoubtedly
fears Lopez _ perhaps more than anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Lopez, encouraged by De La Hoya's reference to his
skills, expects to get the fight that could propel him to stardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's mentioned already that he wants to fight the best
welterweights,'' Lopez said. ``That's why I think the fight will
happen. He doesn't need to be fighting some of the people he's
fighting. It's why boxing is going downhill.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight will happen sooner or later.''
</P>
<P>
   Give us a break: Evander Holyfield and Lennox Lewis, with the
help of their handlers, are sabotaging efforts to put together a
title-unification bout.
</P>
<P>
   First, HBO, which has Lewis under contract, makes a $20 million
offer to Holyfield through the media and alienates him and his
attorney, Jim Thomas. Holyfield and Thomas are right: That's no way
to do business.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Holyfield says he wants $25 million for the fight. Very
simply, that's asking too much.
</P>
<P>
   HBO, which reportedly offered Lewis $10 million, would be taking
a significant risk by putting up (begin ital)$30 million(end ital)
for the fighters, given the poor pay-per-view buy rates for recent
fights.
</P>
<P>
   By asking for $5 million more, Holyfield seems to be pricing
himself out of the fight purposely. Once again, he says he wants
the fight, but his actions are out of sync with his words.
</P>
<P>
   The only reasonable conclusion is this: He doesn't want to
jeopardize a potential third fight with Mike Tyson. Lewis, he might
be thinking, could come afterward.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Last week, I stated that Oscar De La Hoya has
not faced a Hall of Fame-level fighter in his prime.
</P>
<P>
   Not true. Genaro Hernandez is in that category. However _ and
this is a big however _ Hernandez came into the fight with a broken
nose and had to move up in weight....
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Goossen, heartbroken when he had to pull out of a big-money
fight with Roberto Duran last year because of a sprained ankle,
will get another opportunity to face a big-name former champion.
</P>
<P>
   The North Hollywood resident is set to fight Hector ``Macho''
Camacho in a junior middleweight bout on Aug. 11 in Miami,
according to Pat Goossen, P.J.'s father and trainer.
</P>
<P>
   The fight will be televised on USA.
</P>
<P>
   P.J. Goossen is expected to make roughly $20,000, his father
said. That would the biggest payday of his career....
</P>
<P>
   Saturday's pay-per-view card in San Antonio is unique in at
least one respect: seven former champions will be fighting. The
matchups: Azumah Nelson-James Leija, Gabriel Ruelas-Troy Dorsey,
Goyo Vargas-Tracy Patterson and Miguel Angel Gonzalez-Alexis Perez.
Perez is the only non-champion....
</P>
<P>
   Don Dunphy, a blow-by-blow announcer whose career spanned from
Joe Louis to Muhammad Ali, turned 90 on Sunday. &QL;

<P>
   MIMS, Fla. _ Ed Callahan, who served all over the world with the
Army Special Forces and has the tattoos to prove it, stood in front
of a pile of melted glass, scorched metal and blackened wood and
talked tough about the wildfire that leaped out of the Florida
palmettos and consumed his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't bother me,'' he said of the once-immaculate,
middle-class house with a pool that he and his wife had filled with
memories and treasures from his postings in Asia and elsewhere.
Like dozens of others in central and northeast Florida last week,
he and his family left their house when the wildfire threatened,
and returned to find it in ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all insured,'' said Callahan, a retired master sergeant.
``We'll re-do it. Make it even better.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, his wife, Setsuko, squatted in the ruin of the
house. A small woman, she had a smudge of soot on her face as she
carefully poked and sifted through a powdery ash, digging up wine
glasses that had melted into misshapen lumps, uncovering shards of
china, then moving on, foot by foot.
</P>
<P>
   She was looking for something in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my wedding ring,'' she said, and kept on digging.
</P>
<P>
   Even as wildfires raged in counties in northeastern and central
Florida, firefighters, blessed with a few scattered rain showers,
less dry wind and a higher humidity over the weekend, began gaining
ground in fire-ravaged areas instead of just grimly holding it. As
the smoke cleared, those here returned to find the result of the
roaring, popping orange flames that had forced evacuations in
scenes that have haunted the state since May.
</P>
<P>
   In Mims, a small town in Brevard County near Florida's east
central coast, hundreds of people returned to their homes this
weekend. A dozen or so, like the Callahans on Golden Shores Drive,
lost everything they could not hurriedly stuff into their car.
Others, like Frank Kirkland in the Hog Valley neighborhood near
Interstate 95, came home to find some yards and outbuildings
burned, but found with relief that firefighters had killed the
blaze just as it touched their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't been standing right there,'' almost with their
backs to his mobile home, ``it wouldn't be here,'' said Kirkland,
who used to work at the Kennedy Space Center and now raises deer
dogs and pot-bellied pigs.
</P>
<P>
   And still others, like the Mayhew family just outside Mims,
defied evacuation orders and fought the wildfire themselves,
pumping water from a nearby pond and saving a cluster of mobile
homes, although, as 21-year-old Donnie Mayhew said, it almost
seemed as if the fire was determined to have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd put it out in one place and it would come at us from
someplace else,'' Mayhew said. ``I've never seen fire like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has, at least here.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said 1,946 fires have
burned 458,288 acres since June 1, causing an estimated $276
million in damage _ the worst disaster since Hurricane Andrew _ and
injuring 95 people, mostly firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   In the area around Mims and nearby Scottsmoor, about 15 miles
south of the Kennedy Space Center, at least 30 houses have been
destroyed, as about 60 fires continued to burn in the surrounding
county.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, in Flagler County, a mandatory evacuation of
30,000 people remained in effect, as people waited in shelters and
wondered what they would find back home.
</P>
<P>
   People here hope for rain, maybe even a tropical storm, but any
heavy rain _ if it comes at all _ is still days away, forecasters
say.
</P>
<P>
   In Mims, a part of Florida where orange groves, dense scrub and
green inlets provide scenery for U.S. Highway 1, retirees,
blue-collar workers and charter boat captains have watched for days
as the flames threatened five-bedroom dream homes and double-wide
trailers, which were dream houses, too, for some here. Black smut
streaked several roofs of the houses still standing, and vinyl
siding hung wrinkled and warped from others.
</P>
<P>
   Bedsheets, tied to fences and mailboxes, flapped softly in the
faint breeze. ``Thank You, Firefighters,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   And here and there are big piles of ash, where the flames either
attacked houses before firefighters could get there, or, in the
case of a few, drove them away when they did. That is what happened
to the Callahan house, where it got so hot firefighters had to
throw down their hoses and run. They returned a while later, to
apologize. But they did not have to.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, who served in Vietnam, said he did not want anyone to
get hurt trying to save things that could be replaced. He and his
wife and daughter, 21-year-old Naomi, were fine. So were their two
dogs, two cats and a bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're luckier than other people,'' said Callahan. Some
material things, of course, could not be replaced. ``All my
medals,'' he said. ``But hell, I know what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hog Valley, a more rural road where acres of palmettos are
now blackened nubs, Donnie Mayhew sat in deep shade and described
the wildfire that left the landscape this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought it ourselves,'' he said, but he wasn't bragging.
``We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   It began, last week, as a glow in the distance. Then, quickly,
it was racing toward the cluster of mobile homes where Mayhew, his
father, Bill, and other family and friends live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear it coming, crackling and roaring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no steadily marching line of flame. It burned
erratically as the wind shifted and swirled, and new fires sprang
up.
</P>
<P>
   His family had a pond, a pump and a generator to run it. The
generator saved them, after the fires burned down the power poles.
</P>
<P>
   They sprayed the houses and then focused on the fire line
itself, but every time it would seem like they had won, ``the wind
would shift, and it would come at us from the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people here, everything they have is contained in
the aluminum walls of those mobile homes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to stay until we couldn't stay no more,'' said
Mayhew.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Frank Kirkland dumped a bucketful of water
over the head of a pot-bellied pig named Little Bit. The fire had
reached up to the wire of the pen she shared with three babies,
and, apparently, just stopped. She snorted gratefully as the cool
water trickled over her ears.
</P>
<P>
   His emotions were mixed. The firefighters saved his mobile home
at the very last minute but the flames destroyed a building he
called ``my pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a TV, five picnic tables, a jukebox,'' he said. He had
planned a big party for the Fourth of July, and had stored two
whole hogs in a refrigerator, planning to barbecue them.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the refrigerator and gazed down at the meat that had
sizzled inside the freezer as the flames roared around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't get good and done,'' he said, as the stench of rotting
meat filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   For others, there were no mixed blessings, only a feeling that
something terrible had passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   In the shade of a tree near U.S. 1, three firefighters from
Okeechobee _ part of the hundreds who have come here from around
the state and country _ rested between emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   A man they had never seen walked up and thanked them. ``You guys
saved my house, twice,'' said Chet Richards, shaking their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters, Steve Weeks, Jim Fusco and Herb Smith, said it
is something that happens a lot to the firefighters here.
</P>
<P>
   A woman drove up and asked them if they were hungry, and left
them with bags of food and a giant tub of chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk around the corner without somebody bringing you
food,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   It makes it worthwhile, the men said, when it seems like the
ground underneath is about to melt their feet.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ We can only be virtually certain of this, but
Holland will defeat France 6-4 in the World Cup final next Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, tweak the controls on Electronic Arts' wildly
popular ``FIFA World Cup '98'' computer video game, and even the
United States can navigate through the Ronaldos and Bebetos of the
world and come home with that giant blob of a gold trophy.
</P>
<P>
   On the market since spring and lauded as the hottest sports
video game out there by even the most ardent non-soccer fans,
``FIFA World Cup '98'' ($59.95 for the Nintendo 64 version, $39.95
for PC and Sony PlayStation) could be the secret to generating
future American viewing interest in the international game.
</P>
<P>
   How close is it to watching a real game on TV? Better, in this
case, because the MotionBlending technology provides a mesmerizing
re-creation for players or those just watching. Plus, the crowds
are louder, you can make the contests as long or as short as you
care to see, and there are fewer replays (unless you want more).
</P>
<P>
   Using motion-captured data from U.S. players Preki, Roy
Lassiter, Cle Kooiman and goalie Mark Dodd, the EA game has managed
to fulfill its mission ``to recreate every nuance of the World Cup
from delivering the world's most technically advanced soccer game
ever,'' according to Bruce McMillan, the game's executive producer.
</P>
<P>
   Any of the five modes of competition will suit the gamer's level
of ability, from a training area all the way to World Cup Classics,
which replay eight of the all-time greatest matches in Cup history.
</P>
<P>
   In the World Cup mode, players grab onto a team and see if they
can steer it through both stage 1 and 2 of the tournament to claim
the title, just as it's been played for the last few weeks in
France.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, ``FIFA World Cup '98'' seems to reduce to
arcade-game status any competing soccer games like Fox's new ``Fox
Sports Soccer'' and even Konami's ``International Superstar Soccer
64,'' which was voted best console sports game of '97 by the
Academy of Interactive Arts and Sciences at the E3 show this past
May and plans for a new, improved version in the coming months. &QL;

 &HT;    Georgia, Florida National Guards combine to battle fires
 &HT;    (EDS: Updates slug from FLA-FIRES-HELP.)
 &HT;    By Steve Visser
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUNNELL, Fla. _ The Blackhawk UH-60s crews dive toward the
flames and empty 660-gallon buckets of water about 30 feet above
the trees, trying to slow a blaze burning relentlessly Sunday
toward subdivisions in Flagler County, where thousands of people
have fled their homes.
</P>
<P>
   The two helicopters then circle around to Crescent Lake and dip
out another load. It's a task they repeat again and again, making
up to 40 fire attacks an hour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd say this is about as hazardous as it gets,'' said Staff
Sgt. Timothy Loveless, a Georgia National Guard crew chief who
hangs out of the helicopter on approach to eyeball the water drop.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tree exploded under me and all I could see was fire. I
thought my feet were on fire.''
</P>
<P>
   Loveless and 26 fellow Georgians are members of the Guard's
171st Aviation Battalion, which is made up of Georgia and Florida
units. They've been flying out of St. Augustine since June 27,
fighting the wildfires ravaging Florida, after fighting fires in
Waycross, Ga., for a week.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what the National Guard is all about,'' said Brig.
Gen. Tom McCullough of metro Atlanta, who toured the devastated
stretch of northeast Florida by air Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``After a mission like this, they go home and morale is high
because they feel like they've helped people.''
</P>
<P>
   Guard officials have informally named the helicopter mission
``Operation Wetdown.'' Acres of blackened landscape are visible
from the air, but for the most part, the burned land is surrounded
by oceans of green where the flames haven't penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   An east wind had given the firefighters an advantage by slowing
the fires' advance and allowed crews to contain them. Yet black
smoke billowed from a hot fire 13 miles west of Bunnell while white
smoke rose from smoldering pine needles and palmetto, and a shift
in the wind or a pickup in gusts could easily turn the
``contained'' acres into another firestorm.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a bed of pine needles built up over the years and it's
just like gasoline,'' said Staff Sgt. Nicholas Cox, a crew chief
from Lakeland, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Brock Gaston of Marietta, Ga. pointed to areas where the
helicopter crews had been dumping loads over Flagler County, which
Gov. Lawton Chiles ordered evacuated Friday when authorities feared
three fires would converge, creating a firestorm that might make it
impossible for the county's 40,000 residents to escape.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's where we've been working,'' Gaston told the general.
</P>
<P>
   ``It started out as a small fire and we were able to keep it off
of the houses. Then two days later we lost all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The crews refill their huge buckets _ which dangle on 15-foot
cables below the choppers _ from the St. Johns River and the lakes
and ponds dotting the region. They use the closest body of water
because time is crucial.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a few ponds over here we just emptied out getting
water to throw on those fires,'' Gaston said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopter crews rarely manage to put out a fire _ ground
crews have to extinguish them _ but aim to control the fast-moving
wildfires. Each day brings a new threat that a lightning strike or
spark will generate a new fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just trying to slow it down so that the tractors and
bulldozers can cut a fire break through the trees,'' said Sgt.
Phillip Banzhof, a crew chief from Cumming, just north of Atlanta.
``Some of the areas you can't get in because it's so hot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody said putting a bucket on these fires is like spitting
on a campfire,'' said Staff Sgt. Michael Callanan, also of Cumming.
</P>
<P>
   The crew chiefs guide the pilots over the fires, and the
Blackhawks disappear into the smoke as they aim to dump the loads
of water and foam 30 feet above the trees. Sometimes the smoke is
so thick that it forces them higher because of the risk of getting
tangled in trees and power lines, and that decreases their
effectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be able to see the fire _ if we hang a bucket up in
those trees it could be disastrous,'' said Chief Warrant Officer
Kevin Zemetis of Marietta, a helicopter pilot. ``Besides snagging
power lines or trees, the next biggest hazard is dropping 5,600
pounds of water on firefighters on the ground. Three tons of water
landing on somebody could hurt them pretty bad.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, none of the helicopter crews have been hurt and the
firefighters on the ground have suffered only minor injuries _
except for one who was seriously injured Sunday when a tree fell on
his bulldozer.
</P>
<P>
   The crews take their orders from the Florida Division of
Forestry in Tallahassee, which has expertise in fighting fires, and
from a ranger in an observation helicopter. Sometimes the experts
make mistakes. In one instance last week, the guardsmen spotted a
plume of smoke and radioed to ask if they should water it and were
told it didn't pose a risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one that turned into an inferno,'' Loveless said.
</P>
<P>
   But when Gaston's crew spotted a plume of smoke in St. Johns
County during a mop-up mission and radioed for instructions, they
were given the go-ahead to extinguish it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got to kill it before it got started,'' Gaston said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the one silver lining in the dark clouds of smoke over
Florida is that the disaster provides excellent _ and federally
financed _ training for the aviation battalion's wartime mission of
hauling equipment into combat zones, said Col. Art Bruno, who is
director of operation for the battalion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call this a high-hazard mission,'' said Bruno, of
Ellenwood, Ga. ``In our wartime mission, we do a lot of
sling-loading. Sling-loading 600 gallons of water is similar to
sling-loading a humvee.''
</P>
<P>
   The Florida unit has six Blackhawks and the Georgia unit has
five, along with two observation helicopters and a Chinook. The
Blackhawks can be flown only 500 hours before being grounded for
maintenance for 25 days. Florida lost one to maintenance last week
and is about ready to lose another. Georgia has a couple that are
soon to be grounded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that if you fly them this much, you can't do
the maintenance and so you have to ground them,'' Bruno said.

WHEN YOUR BOSS IS A CONSTANT MICRO-MANAGER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 Q:  My boss constantly micro-manages me. He's always checking up on
me and telling me how to do things that I can do perfectly well on
my own. It's gotten to a point where I feel like punching him. What
can I do?
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; Refraining from punching him is a good start. Then, do a
little informal research to find out whether your boss tends to
micro-manage all his employees _ or whether you've been singled
out.
</P>
<P>
   If you're the only one, that should raise a warning flag about
your performance and career prospects, according to Russell Wild,
author of the book, ``Games Bosses Play.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There's probably something wrong (with your work), but he
lacks the time or guts to sit down and talk to you about it,'' Wild
said. ``You need to sit down with him and see what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, if he micro-manages everyone, you can relax a
little. It may be frustrating to deal with, but at least it's not a
sign that your job is in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   You can try to head off this kind of micro-management by asking
your boss in advance how he wants particular tasks done. Or try
setting up a time line of progress reports: If the boss knows that
he's going to get an update from you every day at 4:30, maybe he
won't come by your desk each hour to ask how things are going.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such efforts, your boss still may feel a compulsion to
meddle. You may have to accept that this is part of his
personality, built up over a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stop taking it so personally, and keep your cool,'' Wild said.
``You're not likely to change him unless you get him into therapy
for 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; My wife works part time as a sales clerk and is paid on an
hourly basis. The company often asks her to attend functions
outside her normal work hours, such as evening receptions for
customers. But the company refuses to pay her for this time. My
wife has decided not to go to any more of these functions unless
they pay her. Can they fire her or penalize her for not attending
these events?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; California law says that nonexempt employees must be paid
for every hour they work. And after-hours functions are considered
work time if attendance is mandatory, according to Sharon Grodin,
an attorney with Crosby Heafey Roach &AMP; May in Oakland.
</P>
<P>
   So your wife is right. She should be paid for attending these
events if the company says they're part of her job. If she's not
paid _ or if she's fired for refusing to work without pay _ she can
file a complaint with the California Labor Commissioner at (415)
557-7878.
</P>
<P>
   But reality often is more complicated than the letter of the
law. Company officials may decide to penalize your wife in ways too
subtle to be covered by the Labor Commissioner, who primarily
oversees wage disputes. If your wife's supervisors feel that she's
uncooperative, they may quietly put her in the office doghouse _
denying her the best assignments or handing her the least-desirable
shifts.
</P>
<P>
   Grodin suggests that your wife try to remain in the firm's good
graces by offering to help in other ways that don't involve working
for free. For instance, she could volunteer to prepare refreshments
or decorations for these receptions during her regular work hours.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, employers should clearly indicate when attendance at
after-hours events is mandatory _ and when it truly is voluntary.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies can say things like, `We'd be delighted to have you
there, but your time is your own,''' Grodin said. ``If they frame
it that way, they have no obligation to pay.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q:  &LR; I have a friend who works for a straight sales commission,
with no fixed salary. The company holds back 20 percent of her
commissions for one year, ostensibly in case the customer never
pays up. However, the company seems to have a pattern of firing
salespeople within seven to eight months and keeping that 20
percent of their commissions for ``administrative expenses.'' Is
this legal?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A:  &LR; It's completely legal for firms to place conditions on
payment of sales commissions, as long as they have a reasonable
business justification for it, according to Jamie Johnson, an
attorney with Brobeck Phleger &AMP; Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   So there's nothing wrong with this company holding onto some
portion of each commission until it can see whether the account is
paid in full.
</P>
<P>
   ``But holding on to it for a full year may be kind of stretching
it,'' Johnson added. ``The time frame should be tied to their
collection cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   What IS illegal is firing people in order to deprive them of
their wages _ for instance, terminating a longtime employee without
good cause one week before he or she is supposed to get a $10,000
bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Is that what's going on here? It's hard to say without knowing
more of the details of this case.
</P>
<P>
   The rules governing commissions vary from company to company and
contract to contract. If your friend is worried that her company is
ripping off its salespeople, she probably should consult a lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many detailed plans, and they're so fact-specific
that she should have it checked by an attorney,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Have a question about your workplace or career, your boss or an
employee? Send it to Ilana DeBare, Workways, San Francisco
Chronicle, 901 Mission Street, San Francisco 94103. Or send e-mail
to workways &LR; sfgate.com. Or call (415) 764-2815. We can't respond to
each query in person, but we will answer as many in print as we
can.

GOVERNMENT AND ZAPRUDER FAMILY DEBATE THE PRICE OF HISTORY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 
  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The images are burned into the American
consciousness: The motorcycles appear. Then comes the open
limousine. President John F. Kennedy can be recognized. All of a
sudden his head jerks. Jacqueline Kennedy in her pillbox hat is
climbing over the back seat. The car speeds away.
</P>
<P>
   The 26-second silent home movie of the Kennedy assassination,
taken by a Dallas dress manufacturer, Abraham Zapruder, is probably
the most famous historical film clip and the most widely
scrutinized piece of murder evidence ever.
</P>
<P>
   So how much is it worth?
</P>
<P>
   That is now a matter of serious dispute between the government
and the Zapruder family. After months of negotiations between two
of the most prominent lawyers in Washington, they are still
millions of dollars apart.
</P>
<P>
   Zapruder's heirs (he died of cancer in 1970 at age 66) want the
government to pay them $18.5 million for the original film and its
copyright. They are represented by Robert Bennett, the lawyer who
represents President Clinton in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The government originally offered $750,000 and then raised its
offer to $3 million, but it has refused to go higher. The chief
negotiator for the government is Frank Hunger, who is the assistant
attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's civil
division and who is also the brother-in-law of Vice President Al
Gore.
</P>
<P>
   By the middle of this month, regardless of the outcome of the
legal haggling, a digitally enhanced version will be in video
stores across the country, to be rented or bought. Assassination
buffs and conspiracy purveyors will then be free to analyze the
evidence to their hearts' content on their own VCR's.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides want the government to take ownership of the original
8-millimeter film and its copyright from the Zapruders. The
government has actually had possession of the film since 1978, when
the family deposited it for safekeeping in a freezer at the
National Archives. The only problem is the money.
</P>
<P>
   The film has no intrinsic value, because the copies are of much
higher quality than the original. And because the video is about to
be widely available, the copyright is not worth anything, the
lawyers agree. The question is, how much is the film worth to
collectors as a historical relic?
</P>
<P>
   Bennett said that professional appraisers he retained had found
the value to be as high as $70 million. An official at the Justice
Department said that its appraisals were no higher than $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett compares the film to an original manuscript of the
Declaration of Independence. It is, he argues, as if the government
looked at such a manuscript ``and said, how much is the paper
worth, how much is the ink worth?''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department maintains that a more apt analogy is a
piece of computer software that is widely available and can be
reproduced at will.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett says that the last thing the Zapruders want is to
auction the film, which they view as a national treasure, to the
highest bidder. The Justice Department says that it has a
responsibility to protect the taxpayers from being bilked.
</P>
<P>
   Bennett's most recent offer, he said, was to enter binding
arbitration by an impartial judge with the price to be no higher
than $30 million. The Justice Department has not responded, but an
official said that arbitration was a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations were stimulated by a declaration in April 1997
by the Assassination Records Review Board that the film belonged to
the federal government. The board, created by a 1992 law and given
the mandate to amass all relevant evidence in the Kennedy case,
gave the government and the Zapruder family until August to agree
on how to transfer ownership.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the Zapruder family has been careful to avoid
any appearance of profiteering. Copies of the film have been given
without cost to researchers. Bennett estimated that in 35 years,
the family had made less than $1 million selling rights for
commercial use.
</P>
<P>
   The new videos that will be in the stores this month do not look
like a big money-maker either.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the Zapruders entered a partnership with MPI Home Video
in Orland Park, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   The company, which specializes in historical documentaries, made
a digitally enlarged, frame-by-frame copy of the film, and produced
a 45-minute video titled ``Image of an Assassination: A New Look at
the Zapruder Film.'' In addition to the 26 seconds that Zapruder
recorded, the video includes a narrative and interviews with
Zapruder's business associates, photography experts and employees
of the National Archives.
</P>
<P>
   For those interested in studying each frame, the digitalization
allows, for the first time, an examination of the images between
the sprocket holes on the original film.
</P>
<P>
   Waleed B. Ali, the chief executive officer of MPI, said that he
expected about 250,000 videos to be sold. Originally, the retail
price will be $19.98 for a conventional VHS videotape and $24.98
for a DVD compact disk.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bennett nor Ali would discuss the financial
arrangements. But they said that the Zapruder family would receive
no more than about $3 on each video and that the heirs might not
even recapture what they spent to make the video.
</P>
<P>
   The family's main interest in making Abraham Zapruder's home
movie so widely available, Bennett said, is to rid itself of the
administrative burden of having to decide who can have access to
it, when and for how much.

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In less time than it takes to fly from London to New
York, Hong Kong closed down its international airport Monday just
after midnight and moved the contents 19 miles west to a new $20
billion airport in time for the first flight to land at 6:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the first time a city has switched airports in a
one-day move _ Denver and Munich, Germany, did it. But no
municipality has attempted to do it on quite the same scale or with
the same bravado as Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at midnight, when the last plane took off and the
runway lights at Kai Tak Airport were switched off, a convoy of
1,100 vehicles began rumbling out of the airport and onto
residential streets in Kowloon toward Hong Kong International
Airport, which is built on reclaimed land off Lantau Island.
</P>
<P>
   The move marked the end of Kai Tak, a 73-year-old doyenne of
airports that won the hearts of some people here for its in-town
location and stopped the hearts of others with its spectacular,
roof-skimming approaches.
</P>
<P>
   But for the people working on the move, this was no time for
nostalgia. At a dock next to the runway, cranes were busy hauling
baggage loaders, pallet pushers, and other assorted airport
vehicles onto 14 barges, which later steamed through Victoria
Harbor to the new airport. Thirty-one passenger planes transported
still more equipment from the old airport to its giant successor.
</P>
<P>
   And what of the person who was supervising this vast movement of
men and materiel _ an operation the local government has been
promoting for weeks as ``The Night'' and regularly compares to
D-Day?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all in the planning,'' said Police Superintendent Steve
Wordsworth as he monitored the activity on a bank of television and
radar screens from his airport command center. ``Panic doesn't
help.''
</P>
<P>
   A stout, balding 38-year-old with an easy manner, Wordsworth
said he had been planning the move for 18 months. The Airport
Authority recruited a retired British Army colonel with experience
in logistics to advise him. And it held a full dress rehearsal,
with 40 vehicles, on April 29.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wordsworth admitted his ice-water-in-veins demeanor was a
bit of an act. The move posed immense logistical challenges: a
crowded winding route, a tight timetable and sporadic heavy rain.
And the new airport could not open without the equipment from the
old one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'd think I was calm, cool and collected, but look at my
nails,'' he said with a chuckle, offering up a set of well-chewed
cuticles.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's airport hand over has generated more interest here
than any event since the real hand over, when this former British
colony reverted to Chinese rule. Hong Kong marked the first
anniversary of that milestone last week, with back-to-back visits
from President Jiang Zemin of China and President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But the local newspapers still managed to put the visits in the
context of the new airport. They noted that the Chinese leader
became the first passenger to depart from the airport, after a
dedication ceremony on Thursday. Eight hours later, Air Force One
landed at the airport, making the American president the first
passenger to arrive there.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the interest in airports stems from the fact that Kai
Tak holds a special space in the memories and imagination of people
here. The airport is in the middle of town, just across the harbor
from Hong Kong's skyscrapers. Its dramatic approach, in which
pilots veer sharply right to avoid a hill and skim the rooftops and
clothes-lines of Kowloon, is a legend in the airline industry.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Larry Walters, a pilot with United Airlines, landed the
airline's last flight, a 747 from Los Angeles, here on Sunday
evening.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was always fun for us,'' he said, ``We actually got to use
our skills a bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of Hong Kong families turned out with cameras to take
a last tour of Kai Tak's somewhat worn terminal building. Some even
booked rooms at the adjacent Regal Airport Hotel, which offered a
special one-night package of dinner and a room with a view of the
runway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel sad about its closing,'' said Stephen Chu, a
46-year-old university lecturer, as he waited to check in for a
flight to Melbourne, Australia. ``I've been using it since I was a
boy. It's been a part of our lives for so long.''
</P>
<P>
   Chu said he remembered a tearful farewell in the departure
lounge four years ago when he saw off his parents, who were
immigrating to Canada. He now lives in Kowloon Tong, a neighborhood
under the old flight path, so close to the planes, he said, that he
would ``wave to the people in the windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Hong Kong has a new airport with a host of superlatives:
the world's largest terminal, one of the world's largest airport
shopping malls, and one of the biggest hotels. At $20 billion, it
is the second-most-expensive airport, after Kansai International in
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Still, even Clinton expressed regret about the end of Kai Tak _
saying in a speech after he arrived here last week that landing
there on a previous visit ``was one of the most exciting and
uncertain experiences of my lifetime.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saks Fifth Avenue, one of the most venerable names in
retail, said Sunday that it would be acquired for $2.1 billion by
Proffitt's Inc., a Southern retailing company that is all but
unknown to New York shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal would represent the end of an era for Saks,
whose founders, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel, probably never
imagined that the famous store on natty Fifth Avenue would one day
be part of a retail conglomerate based in Alcoa, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saks was founded in 1924, it has undergone several changes
of ownership, managing to escape the fate of many famous New York
stores. It avoided extinction, unlike B. Altman and Gimbel's, and
it was not swallowed up by a giant retail company, as was Macy's
when it was acquired by Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers on Fifth Avenue looking for the latest Gucci shoe,
the change of ownership will not be noticeable, but those living in
the Midwest, where some of Saks' less profitable stores are, may
see a different name above the door. And some of Proffitt's stores
may change their name to Saks. In fact, Proffitt's will rename
itself Saks Inc., seeking some of the glamour of the famous name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just one Saks Fifth Avenue, and the power of the
brand is exactly where retail is going,'' said Robert Bradley
Martin, Proffitt's chief executive, who will be the chairman and
chief executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger serves as a near-exit strategy for the largest
shareholder of Saks Holdings Inc., the Bahrain-based investment
company Investcorp International, which bought the retailer for
$1.6 billion in 1990 and had been hoping in recent years to make a
killing the way it did with other luxury investments like Tiffany &AMP;
Co. and Gucci Group.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bank initially sold 20 percent of Saks to the
public in 1995 for $425 million and followed up with another stock
offering, it now finds itself and its clients not cashing out as
they had hoped, but rather holding 12 percent of Proffitt's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on Thursday's closing stock prices, Investcorp and
other shareholders in Saks now own stock worth about 15 percent
more than last week, assuming shareholders of both companies
approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Proffitts does not seem to be the best match for
Saks. Proffitt's runs 234 stores that serve middle-income shoppers
in the South and Midwest with names like Proffitt's, Younkers,
Carson Pirie Scott, and Herbergers. Most of the stores resemble
Macy's in terms of what they sell _ lots of Tommy Hilfiger, Liz
Claiborne, Nine West and Estee Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   Saks has the opposite strategy at its 95 stores nationwide. Many
of the brands that Proffitt's specializes in were evicted from Saks
two years ago in an effort to give the retailer a tonier image. Its
staples are Gucci, Oscar de la Renta and Yves St. Laurent, all
names not carried even in Proffitt's most upscale store, Parisian.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of merchandise synergies, there are none,'' Martin
admitted. ``But we'll buy telecommunications, transportation, paper
supplies and other things at an enormous cost savings. This deal is
not built on merchandise synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's, which was founded in 1919 with a handful of stores
in Knoxville, Tenn., has built its fortunes on the success of
acquisitions. In the last three years, it has acquired a dizzying
seven names, including Carson Pirie Scott in the Midwest, and has
slowly built up a portfolio, creating $3.5 billion in revenue. As a
result of the acquisitions, sales and profit margins have risen
smartly as expenses have become lower.
</P>
<P>
   While the company was attracted to operational cost savings with
the Saks acquisition, it is also eager to tap into the Saks fashion
savvy that has been lacking at Proffitt's.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will form a product-development unit that will
build up private-label programs for all the divisions. Saks already
has a strong variety of private-label brands, and Proffitt's has
said that it wants 12 percent of its merchandise to be private
label.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the two stores now have access to each other's geographic
regions. Expanding on both coasts, for example, ``would be a good
supplement to what Proffitt's does in the Midwest,'' said Isaac
Lagnado, a retail consultant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans for the new company include greater international
use of the Saks name, an increase in the number of domestic stores,
and an expanded use of the database of Saks credit-card holders and
catalog shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's will keep its headquarters in Tennessee, while Saks
will be run more or less independent of the company's other
divisions, by its current management team out of New York.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Philip B. Miller, the chief executive of Saks, Brian
Kendrick, the retailer's chief operating officer, and Martin sat in
Miller's opulent office across the street from the company's
flagship store, talking of how enthusiastic they were about the
deal. ``Brad has demonstrated that he has the vision and financial
acumen to assemble businesses,'' Miller said of Martin. Martin
added, ``This is a deal I am really excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   But although both are powerful retail executives in their own
right, their backgrounds and manner could not be more dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 60, has been a retailer for his entire career. He began
at Filene's; he has been chairman of Marshall Field's and president
of Neiman Marcus and has held executive positions at Lord &AMP; Taylor
and Bloomingdale's. Martin, 46, fell into retail almost by accident
after serving in the Tennessee House of Representatives for 10
years and dabbling in real estate. In 1984, he bought Proffitt's,
noting that his wife liked to shop there. He took it public in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the epitome of a New York retailer, with custom
chalk-striped suits, burgundy suspenders and matching tie.
</P>
<P>
   His year-round tan suggests time spent at exotic outposts, and
his expensive wing-tipped shoes show that he cares about the sport
of shopping. His eyes light up when he talks about fashion; he
hobnobs with the likes of the designer Isaac Mizrahi, whom he
honored at a charity event he ran last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Martin looks like a high school vice principal. On Sunday he was
wearing a checked shirt, a casual floral tie and the sort of
nondescript plain black shoes that get replaced every two years
when their soles wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous friends are Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican and former governor, with whom Martin once ran a
business, and Bob Keeshan, known to the rest of the world as
Captain Kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   Martin turns a conversation about retail to the area of cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, shareholders of Saks Holdings would
be given 0.82 share of Proffitt's in exchange for each Saks share,
representing a transaction of about $2.1 billion, or a little less
than Saks' annual sales of $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Thursday's closing stock prices, each share of Saks
would be worth about $33.36; the stock closed last week at $29, up
$1.625. That 15 percent premium, however, is likely to change as
Wall Street reacts on Monday to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And shareholders may do better with shares in the new company.
Saks went public at $25 a share and has averaged about $23 this
year. By contrast, Proffitt's shares closed at $40.6875 Thursday, a
48 percent increase since the beginning of the year and far more in
line with Standard &AMP; Poor's retail index, which is up about 30
percent to date.
</P>
<P>
   Saks was represented in the deal by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Proffitt's was represented by Salomon Smith
Barney Inc.

FIRMS HIRING TEEN TECHIES TO SOLVE LABOR CRUNCH 
</HEADLINE>
   By ILANA DEBARE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Morgan McNamara had all the technical skills necessary to land a
job at LineX, an Internet service provider in San Rafael. He also
had more than enough enthusiasm and dedication.
<TEXT>
<P>
   McNamara was lacking just one thing _ a driver's license.
</P>
<P>
   So McNamara, who is 16, had his parents pick him up after school
each day and drive him to LineX. There he would field phone calls
from customers twice his age who were having trouble connecting to
the Internet, sending e-mail or viewing Web pages.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if the customers can tell my age,'' McNamara
said. ``No one has ever asked. And if I can solve problems just the
same as the other reps, then I don't think it should make a
difference.''
</P>
<P>
   LineX is one of a number of Bay Area employers that have found a
novel solution to the tight and pricey high-tech labor market _
teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. labor officials estimate that there are 22,000 16-to
19-year-olds working in the data-processing and computer
industries. That represents 1.4 percent of all employees in those
industries, up from 0.8 percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Many are college students or high school graduates. But some
like McNamara are younger _ high school students with side careers
as Web masters, network technicians or programmers.
</P>
<P>
   Igor Kazakov, 15, was hired last year as a ninth grader to
manage the Web site of a video game retailer in Mill Valley.
</P>
<P>
   And Will Hayes, 17, landed work building a Web site for a small
solar energy company in Richmond while still a junior. This summer,
he's continuing to develop Web sites while also doing computer work
as an intern at MPR Associates, a market research firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I went to work in a law firm or a doctor's office, I'd
probably just be someone who was in the way,'' Hayes said. ``But
when it comes to computers, older people are always asking me
questions about how to do things. Younger people are looked on with
a lot more respect (in technology) than in other fields.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies are hiring teenage techies for several reasons. Some
small, struggling entrepreneurs turn to the son or daughter of a
friend to build them a Web site because they simply can't afford to
hire an adult professional.
</P>
<P>
   Walt Pyle, chief executive of H-Ion Solar Inc., estimates that
it would have cost him $500 or $1,000 for an adult to develop his
Web site. Instead, he hired Hayes, the son of one of the company's
directors, for about $200.
</P>
<P>
   ``It worked a lot better than I thought it would _ as well as if
I hired a 35-year-old professional,'' said Pyle, whose firm makes
equipment such as a hydrogen-powered tabletop grill. ``We were
happy to have the page and got it at a good price. And Will had
something that's in the alley of what he's interested in doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other employers use teens not just to cut costs, but because
they simply can't find enough adult technical experts.
</P>
<P>
   Contra Costa County officials say they have a chronic problem
filling technical vacancies because public-sector salaries and
benefits lag far behind those offered in Silicon Valley.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, Contra Costa hired five high school interns,
initially as a community service. But the students proved so
capable that they became an integral part of the county's computer
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Half of my total networking staff are either contractors,
trainees or in high school,'' said John Forberg, deputy director of
information services for the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``These kids don't understand the term, `You can't do this
because it was tried before and didn't work,' '' said Steven
Steinbrecher, chief information officer for Contra Costa &UR;  &LR; County.
``It forces my regular employees to stand back and look at their
work and say, `Hm, there's competition out there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, there are some places where workplace and
school-age cultures don't exactly match.
</P>
<P>
   Contra Costa intern Rex Fujikawa, 19, kept his ponytail but was
told to remove his green-sparkle nail polish when he started work
for the county last summer.
</P>
<P>
   And Ted Biggs, 18, comes to work at the Contra Costa County
offices in a shirt and tie _ plus four earrings and four bracelets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right about now last year, I'd be over at the skate park,
listening to some punk concert,'' grinned Biggs, who is developing
standard procedures on how to make all the county's desktop
computers Year 2000-compliant. ``I never thought that this summer
I'd be working for `the man.' ''
</P>
<P>
   County officials say the main area where the students need
guidance is not in handling technical problems, but in learning
about office politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to prepare them for the fact that sometimes customers
lie and say things like `I didn't delete those files,' '' Forberg
said. ``It's tough for a younger person when an older person does
that intentionally.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers wonder whether the growing use of teen computer
experts could further undermine the job prospects of older
programmers, who already complain about age bias within the
technology world.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, teens are a lot cheaper than older workers: Contra
Costa pays its interns about $10 an hour for work that would cost
$65 to $200 an hour from an adult.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get tons of e-mail from older programmers, age 40 and up,
who can't find work,'' said Norman Matloff, a computer science
professor at the University of California at Davis. ``There are a
lot of older programmers out there that companies could hire. ...
This is part of a bigger picture where employers want cheap
labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Observers like Matloff also worry that some tech-savvy teens
will find the job market so lucrative and alluring that they forgo
college _ a decision that could severely limit their career options
down the line.
</P>
<P>
   In Contra Costa County, officials make sure that isn't going to
happen. They keep tabs on their interns' grades during the school
year and gear the internship program toward kids who intend to go
to college.
</P>
<P>
   For many teens, money isn't the point _ though it's great to be
paid for doing something they'd be doing as a hobby anyhow.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest thrill is being treated like an adult _ working on
sophisticated equipment they'd never see at school and having carte
blanche to spend hours and hours solving real-world technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I go in to work, I have an attitude of `This is it;
I'm going to blow their mind and show them I know more than they
ever expect,' '' Hayes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd pay THEM to let me be here 12 hours a day!'' said
Fujikawa, who is personally overseeing the launch of a
network-computer system for the county. ``The reality is, 14- or
16-year-olds can make $25 to $40 an hour these days if they have
the right skills. A lot of my college friends do work as
contractors when they're on break ... It's really amazing that what
a bunch of teenagers call fun sells in mainstream America.''

Sampras wins fifth Wimbledon crown
<TEXT>
<P>
   By DALE ROBERTSON &QL; 
WIMBLEDON, England _ Pete Sampras is dead even with Bjorn Borg. And
Goran Ivanisevic, who's catching up with Ken Rosewall in a less
auspicious category, feels dead inside.
</P>
<P>
   The thrill of victory, expressed by a screaming, fist-pumping
Sampras, and the agony of defeat, which turned Ivanisevic
inconsolable, could not be more obviously contrasted than at
Wimbledon on Sunday, where Sampras celebrated his fifth men's
singles title in six years to tie Borg's modern record.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess,'' Sampras said, ``I'm out of my slump. It's hard to
believe. I'm just a little overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic's post-mortem?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst moment of my life the worst thing ever,'' he
said, holding his head in his hands.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras would be aced 32 times by the bearded, bazooka-launching
Croatian, whom he had defeated in straight sets for the 1994
championship. He dropped an early tiebreaker badly and got blown
off the court in the lone break of the fourth set, when Ivanisevic
blasted four return winners by him.
</P>
<P>
   But the top-seeded, still No. 1-ranked American kept his wits
and finished impressively, taking a 6-7 (7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4,
3-6, 6-2 victory that concluded in slightly less than 2{ hours with
Sampras breaking Ivanisevic at love.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody does that to Ivanisevic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit three first serves, and he hit three returns like (it
was) a woman serving,'' Ivanisevic said. ``They were not going
anywhere; no pace, no nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Both men had been struggling through difficult years. Now,
presto, Sampras has fixed his, cementing his top ranking _ which
could have been lost Sunday _ after a long shaky patch dating to an
early exit from the Australian Open. But for Ivanisevic, whose
ranking has plummeted from second to 25th in the four years since
that last Wimbledon final against Sampras, a bad run just became a
lot worse.
</P>
<P>
   He had lost nine first-round matches in 1998 and failed to reach
the second round in four of five majors. Making the final here
should have provided a welcome respite, but he refused to see it
that way in his gloom.
</P>
<P>
   Even Croatia's stunning World Cup victory over Germany the
previous evening was no longer enough to pick him up after three
losses in three Wimbledon finals.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he would go on to France to root for his country's
soccer team this week, Ivanisevic said: ``I cannot cheer anybody
now. I can only kill myself. I am not good for anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Borg had set the 20th-century Wimbledon record with five
consecutive triumphs from 1976 through 1980. William Renshaw holds
the overall record with seven in eight years, but the last of them
came in 1888, when the so-called Challenge Round system was in
place. Then, a standing champion had to win only one match to hold
on to the Cup.
</P>
<P>
   At the other end of the spectrum, just Rosewall, who went 0-4
between 1954 and 1974, has more finals defeats without a victory
than Ivanisevic in this century. Jimmy Connors lost four as well,
but he also won twice.
</P>
<P>
   At least Ivanisevic's travails have lasted the relatively brief
span of seven fortnights, beginning with his defeat by Andre Agassi
in 1992. In that tournament's semifinals, Ivanisevic had eliminated
Sampras, whose match record here since is 39-1, his single loss
coming in the '96 quarterfinals to the eventual champion, Richard
Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras and the lefthanded Ivanisevic, born roughly a month
apart in 1971, are more similar than not, two mammoth servers who
find these slippery lawns to be custom-made for their power games.
But Sampras has won 11 Grand Slam titles, one shy of Roy Emerson's
record; Ivanisevic must live with the fact he's the best player on
the Association of Tennis Professionals Tour without a single Slam
to his name.
</P>
<P>
   Jana Novotna had flung the same monkey off her back in the
women's final Saturday. But the 14th-seeded Ivanisevic, facing a
far more difficult obstacle in Sampras than Novotna had in Nathalie
Tauziat, wasn't up to his challenge.
</P>
<P>
   He came close. He did well, actually, putting Sampras in a quick
hole with a strong first-set tiebreaker and then reaching set point
twice _ against Sampras second serves _ in the second-set breaker.
Sampras admitted feeling the match ``slipping away'' there, saying:
``I thought, `God, this could be Goran's year.'''
</P>
<P>
   But once they reached the fifth set, the champion's resolve in
Sampras and the ingrained also-ran's mentality in Ivanisevic came
to the fore. Sampras never has lost a five-setter at Wimbledon. Nor
a final.
</P>
<P>
   His victims, besides Ivanisevic, have been Jim Courier, Boris
Becker and, last year, Cedric Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to all the finals I've played,'' he said, ``this was
by far the toughest. I didn't think I was quite in control of the
match. Goran was playing huge and, you know, the fifth set that's
anybody's ballgame. You just have to stay patient with Goran. He's
going to pop his aces. There's nothing you can do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a bit lucky out there today. I raised my level just
enough, and before I knew it, I'd won it. It's hard to believe I've
got five. I never thought Borg's (record) would be broken.''
</P>
<P>
   Will he do it?
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' Sampras said, ``but right now I just want to
enjoy this one as much as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   While Sampras celebrated, doing the traditional champion's walk
around the court, raising the cup to the crowd, Ivanisevic put his
head under a towel. You could see he was talking to himself. The
subject matter?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's between me,'' he said, ``and me.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic finally did rise and, without smiling, acknowledge
the fans, who had favored him for most of the afternoon. His mood
hadn't lightened when he surfaced for his news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had too many chances to let this match go,'' Ivanisevic
said. ``Pete didn't play that well. If I go up 2-0, I don't think
he would come back. No chance.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tough. My legs were not there at the end. I gave
everything in that fourth set, and then it was like somebody hit
me. He went up. I went down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic had needed five sets to defeat Krajicek in the
semifinals Friday, and the fifth went 15-13. But Sampras said he
didn't see any fatigue in Ivanisevic's body language.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense it one bit,'' he said. ``I thought his serve
was still coming in real big. In the fifth set of a Wimbledon
final, you just have to suck it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras believes Ivanisevic eventually will win Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, his game is too big, and his serve is too big for him
not to,'' Sampras said. ``It's not really much that separates us.''
</P>
<P>
   Except those 11 Slams.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Take these five sure-fire ways to keep baseball's
post-strike momentum going somewhat forward in the second half of
nineteen-and-uh-ninety-eight to your next town hollerin' meeting
and shove it in the suggestion box with two pennies taped around
it:
</P>
<P>
   1. Allow Mark McGwire to use an aluminum bat against any team
that issues him an intentional walk _ and !ital!then force them to
pitch to him. That chicken-livered strategy will end !ital!really
fast.
</P>
<P>
   2. Bud Selig out, Ben Stein in for permanent commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   3. No more criss-cross mowing on infield or outfield grass. It's
starting to look like some strange crop circle phenomenon, or, in
the Dodgers' case, a subliminal promotion of the ``X Files.''
</P>
<P>
   4. Make Cracker Jacks start giving away good prizes again.
</P>
<P>
   5. Have Tony Danza come to the mound and bring in Bruce Willis
to pitch to Demi Moore at ``Hollywood Stars'' night.
</P>
<P>
   Count 'em: Only 14 players and two coaches remain from the
Dodgers' Opening Day roster....
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Lasorda will announce soon he has officially called off
the search for a non-interim general manager....
</P>
<P>
   Giants manager Dusty Baker said it about the Edison Field rock
formation out in center field when he saw it for the first time
last week: ``You expect to see Fred Flintstone coming out of there.
With Barney.''...
</P>
<P>
   With Steve Duchesne back on the Kings' payroll at almost $4
million a year (a bit more expensive than if he stayed and Wayne
Gretzky hadn't forced them to ship him out seven years ago),
restricted free-agent Rob Blake will likely re-sign for about $6
million a pop. But his agent is awaiting the outcome of Uwe Krupp's
contract talks to get a range on a final figure....
</P>
<P>
   Kings GM Dave Taylor might be more disappointed he couldn't also
sign up Geoff Courtnall instead of Brett Hull in the Blues' garage
sale....
</P>
<P>
   Jeers _ a long, standing one _ to TV Guide's guide-dogs who
today release a sexy ``Special Collectors' Editon'' issue touting
the ranking of ``TV's 50 Greatest Sports Moments.'' They list the
``Miracle On Ice'' !ital!Number 23 and Kirk Gibson '88 World Series
home run !ital!Number 29 after putting Torvill and Dean's perfect
6.0 at the '84 Winter Olympics in the top 10....
</P>
<P>
   In one of those Harris Poll surveys (of 1,000 adults from June
17-22), 74 percent said they've read or heard about the World Cup,
52 percent said they knew it's a soccer event and 25 percent said
they knew it's in France.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if they watched any games on TV, 19 percent said they did.
Of that 19 percent, they were asked how much they enjoyed watching.
``Not much'' came in with 45 percent....
</P>
<P>
   The title of Deion Sanders' harrowing autobiography, due out in
October, is ``Power, Money &AMP; Sex: How Success Almost Ruined My
Life.'' Which manages to include almost every buzzword needed these
days to sell a reputed piece of non-fiction....
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson's talk show just isn't the same without his
patented opening monologue....
</P>
<P>
   NFL decision-makers agree Houston has lapped L.A. in the bid to
get a franchise back....
</P>
<P>
   The ``1998 Best Sports Cities'' list by The Sporting News: 1.
Detroit, 2. Boston, 3. Dallas-Ft. Worth, 4. Chicago, 5. Denver, 6.
Philadelphia, 7. New York, 8. Miami-Fort Lauderdale, 9. San
Francisco-Oakland-San Jose, 10. Baltimore-Washington D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and L.A. is 11th....
</P>
<P>
   Kobe Bryant's agent, Arn Tellem, was included in Ad Age
magazine's ``Marketing 100,'' which lauds those ``visionaries who
latch onto an idea, run with it and achieve their goal of greater
sales or recognition.''
</P>
<P>
   Tellem to Kobe: ``Try dunking more.'' Kobe to Tellem: ``OK.''...
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 folks who list ``actor'' on their income tax
forms auditioned for the role of Michael Jordan in a made-for-cable
bioflick planned for the Fox Family Channel....
</P>
<P>
   Just when Shaquille O'Neal and his pals are being locked out by
their employers, he finds out his deal with Reebok is over after
six years (he's probably going to hook up with Adidas). More
break-ups between athletic endorsers and shoe companies are bound
to happen in the next year or so, say business analysts....
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Reebok CEO Paul Fireman is constructing a new $12
million, 27,000-square-foot home in Brookline, Mass. &QL;

World Cup's Cinderella wears Croatian slipper
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
MARSEILLE, France _ Cinderella is from Zagreb.
</P>
<P>
   She has thick, dark facial hair, smokes non-filters in the
locker room and likes to eat blood sausage and sweetbreads. And we
aren't talking croissants, here.
</P>
<P>
   She is at the World Cup, and the gown she wears is a soccer
jersey that looks like a tablecloth from a Sicilian bistro.
</P>
<P>
   She wears cleats and is not afraid to use them on people's
knees. And if you try to intimidate her, she'll push back and curse
you like a Marine on three-day leave.
</P>
<P>
   She is Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   The little tough guys had their day Saturday at a place called
Stade Gerland in Lyon, where the German stars strutted in like
studs but walked away purring like kittens or whining like an '87
Jetta in need of a new alternator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you believe we beat Germany?'' chain-smoking Croatia coach
Miroslav Blazevic said. ``Nobody beats Germany like we did. Not in
this day.''
</P>
<P>
   Believe it. On an unforgettable Saturday, the Croats stuck one
in the Germans' throats 3-0, sending the World Cup into a tizzy and
rendering every pre-1991 World Atlas useless once and for all.
</P>
<P>
   This tiny, new, previously unidentifiable nation, where the
entire population (4.7 million) numbers less than the number of
registered soccer players in Germany (6.2 million), pulled off the
upset of the World Cup, if not the past four or five World Cups.
</P>
<P>
   And with the victory, which sends Croatia into Wednesday's
semifinal against France, it might have accomplished in one
unforgettable evening what the past seven war-laced years at home
could not.
</P>
<P>
   It made people notice the Croatian flag. It gave the
red-and-white checkerboard-lined Croatia jerseys an indisputable
aura. And it gave the Croatian people something about which to feel
good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we played that game, most of the world didn't know who
we were,'' said Croatia forward Davor Suker, who capped the
extraordinary rout with a goal in the 86th minute. ``Now, everyone
knows. This is the greatest day in the history of Croatian
football.''
</P>
<P>
   The upset indeed figures to be etched into World Cup lore.
Certainly, it brought unprecedented attention to a small strip of a
nation on the Dalmatian coast.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia, which became independent of Yugoslavia in 1991 and made
Zagreb its capital, has warred with Serbia off and on since. It is
a scenic Eastern European nation whose people are known to love to
eat red meat when they're not feasting on soccer and basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But prior to 1991, not only did Croatia not have a history of
soccer, it had little history at all and nothing in the way of
direction. No soccer balls. No federation. No national programs.
There were only remnants of what the Yugoslavian republic had
built.
</P>
<P>
   At USA '94, Croatia did not compete because it still had not
fielded a national team.
</P>
<P>
   It was a nation rich in athletic talent and its passion for
sports, but it was an infant among world powers in terms of
tradition.
</P>
<P>
   Basketball, which is hugely popular in Croatia, provided such
NBA players as Toni Kukoc and Dino Radja.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia also quickly cobbled together an admirable Olympic
program after gaining independence and even won the gold medal in
team handball in 1996. It also competed well in track and field and
other events at Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Croatia also counts tennis among its more popular sports.
Sunday, Goran Ivanisevic battled Pete Sampras for the Wimbledon
crown but lost in five sets.
</P>
<P>
   Like most European nations, however, Croatia considers soccer
its national sport.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this was Germany that Croatia beat. It outbattled,
outsmarted and stood toe-to-toe against a three-time World Cup
champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we are aware of what we have done,'' defender
Slaven Bilic said. ``This is a dream come true, but we are not
afraid of anybody. When coach Blazevic told us two years ago that
we were the best in the world, we all laughed. But we are laughing
less and less now.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory over Germany only proved the kind of serious
contender this team is. It is the first nation to advance this far
in its first World Cup appearance since Portugal made the
semifinals in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   But from the outset of this World Cup, Croatia has proved
Cinderella has learned tough lessons well.
</P>
<P>
   The crucial first-half red card drawn by Croatia's Suker against
Germany's Christian Woerns on Saturday was something most observers
would have expected to occur the other way around.
</P>
<P>
   The World Cup rookies should have been the ones losing their
cool in what was a physical game, not the 12-time quarterfinalists
proudly schooled in prevailing against all odds and instigators.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, the Germans cried foul and complained about the
red card _ ironic, considering Germany benefited from a similar
call in ousting Croatia from the 1996 European Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``The match was billed as a David and Goliath encounter, but we
can now ask the question, `Who was who?''' Suker said. ``We were
better than Germany in every aspect of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the attack against me, we knew how to take control of
the game, and we did. The German players' reactions were not
justified, because last time at Euro 96, we paid the price of a
refereeing decision. Justice was ours in this one.''
</P>
<P>
   Could the ultimate prize be next?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were the best team in the world (Saturday night),''
goalkeeper Drazen Ladic said. ``We will battle anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   It is the style of this team.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps they are such battlers because of the ravages of war
their country has experienced, or perhaps it is a result of
coaching philosophy. But Croatia has gained a reputation for
fighting until the last man falls.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday night, Croatian midfielder Mario Stanic collapsed while
walking off the field after the victory, fainting from exhaustion
and having to be revived by trainers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are tough and do not give up,'' German coach Berti Vogts
said.
</P>
<P>
   Before Croatia gained independence from the Yugoslavian
republic, Suker once was suspended from the national team for going
into the stands and fending off a Serbian police officer who was
beating a Croatian fan.
</P>
<P>
   Forward Goran Vlaovic came back from brain surgery just months
ago to earn a spot on the World Cup team. And Ladic began the World
Cup with a broken bone in his hand, which goalkeepers tend to use
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you beat us, you earned the victory,'' Suker said. ``We
have 10 men who run the entire field. We play with our hearts. We
want to show that not always do the big teams win.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest fell Saturday night. Next come the World Cup
host and 80,000 fans at Stade de France.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never has a country so small come up with a game like we
played against Germany,'' Ladic said. ``Many people in our country
had a bad time in the war. We dedicate this tournament to them. We
hope we can give them some more joy.''
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of millions of people are expected to watch Wednesday's
semifinal. Take notice, world. Cinderella is on a rampage.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to the last four teams, you are no impostor,''
Suker said. ``Before the World Cup we believed that the more games
we played, the better we would become. I think we'll play even
better against France. I think we could go all the way.''

THE DARK SIDE OF WORKING FOR A SMALL BUSINESS 
</HEADLINE>
   By JONATHAN MARSHALL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
Small may be beautiful, but not when it comes to your paycheck _
and maybe not when it comes to your employer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Workers earn significantly lower wages and fewer benefits at
small companies, according to a long line of studies capped by a
controversial new report issued last week by the left-leaning
Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The report challenges America's love affair with small
businesses by asserting that they aren't such great places to work
after all and don't deserve the special breaks they enjoy from
government health, safety and labor regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Already, the report has ticked off the small-business lobby.
``Hogwash,'' said Jim Weidman, a spokesman for the National
Federation of Independent Business in Washington, D.C. ``These
people just drive me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   But economists Dale Belman at the University of Wisconsin and
Erica Groshen at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, authors of
the EPI study, can't be dismissed so quickly. They use a special
1993 supplement to the Census Bureau's Current Population Survey to
match wages and benefits to firm size.
</P>
<P>
   The data show that employees at firms with more than 1,000
workers made an average wage of $13.05 an hour in 1993 _ 39 percent
more than the $9.39 average at firms with fewer than 25 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The gap in benefits was even larger. Among employees of large
firms, 69 percent were covered by a pension plan. At the smallest
companies, the figure was only 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The same story held for health insurance. At big enterprises, 78
percent of workers were covered by health plans at their firm,
compared with 30 percent of workers at small companies.
</P>
<P>
   And perhaps as a result of better pay, workers at large
companies stuck with their employers longer. Average job tenure at
large companies was 8.5 years, nearly twice the 4.4-year average at
small firms.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these differences have nothing to do with the firms as
such; they reflect, for instance, the fact that young adults, who
earn less because of their inexperience, are more likely to work at
small firms.
</P>
<P>
   But when Belman and Groshen controlled for factors such as age,
education and occupation, they found that a large wage gap remained
between large and small firms. And they showed that the gap hasn't
diminished since at least the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Economists still don't understand just why large firms pay more.
Surveys show that large firms train workers more, so one
possibility is that their employees are more productive as a
result. High wages, in turn, encourage workers to stick around
longer with the firm, so the firm enjoys the full fruits of their
training.
</P>
<P>
   Belman argues that researchers should nail down the reason so
smaller businesses could benefit from whatever it is large
businesses are doing right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe there's a combination of training and job security that
supports high productivity and high wages,'' he said. ``Or maybe
it's that large firms invest more capital to make employees more
productive.''
</P>
<P>
   Belman emphasized the need for balance rather than worship in
discussions of small business. ``I'm not saying mom and pop grocery
stores or startups are bad things, but we should know as we
celebrate them that they carry real disadvantages for their
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   Given those disadvantages, Belman also questions whether small
firms should continue to be exempt from minimum-wage laws, the
Toxic Substance Control Act, Occupational Safety and Health
Administration inspections and other government regulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``If these regulations are important to employees, we shouldn't
distinguish by firm size,'' he said. ``Being injured or killed at a
firm with fewer than 20 employees is as serious as being injured at
a large firm which is inspected by OSHA.''
</P>
<P>
   Small-business spokesman Weidman isn't impressed by the data
analyzed by Belman and Groshen. He noted that many workers at small
firms get benefits from spouses or parents who are covered by
larger companies. And he cited an Inc./Gallup poll last year that
found much higher levels of job satisfaction among workers in small
companies than large ones.
</P>
<P>
   ``Apparently, workers at small firms don't understand how bad
off they are,'' Weidman said sarcastically. ``I'm just glad EPI is
there to straighten them out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another point in favor of small business: Every successful big
firm started out small. If you dampen the dynamism of small
business, you won't get as many large firms that pay high wages.
</P>
<P>
   David Birch, head of Cognetics Inc. in Cambridge, Mass., finds
that a disproportionate amount of job growth in America comes from
fewer than 400,000 companies that double in size every four years,
which he calls ``gazelles.'' More than a third of gazelles start
their growth spurt with fewer than 100 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Besides growing far faster than average, gazelles pay more than
average, too. Birch concedes that most small businesses, like the
local barber shop or hardware store, pay less than large firms. But
growing small firms break the mold. From 1992 to 1996, firms with
fewer than 100 employees created 87 percent of new high-wage jobs _
paying about $30,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Such growth won't occur if excessive regulations strangle
emerging businesses, Birch argues. ``I don't know which of the 1.3
million firms that start up every year will become gazelles,'' he
said. ``So you have to keep throwing seeds and hope some will
grow.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIMS, Fla. _ Ed Callahan, who served all over the world with the
Army Special Forces and has the tattoos to prove it, stood in front
of a pile of melted glass, scorched metal and blackened wood and
talked tough about the wildfire that leaped out of the Florida
palmettos and consumed his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't bother me,'' he said of the once-immaculate,
middle-class house with a pool that he and his wife had filled with
memories and treasures from his postings in Asia and elsewhere.
Like dozens of others in central and northeast Florida last week,
he and his family left their house when the wildfire threatened,
and returned to find it in ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all insured,'' said Callahan, a retired master sergeant.
``We'll re-do it. Make it even better.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, his wife, Setsuko, squatted in the ruin of the
house. A small woman, she had a smudge of soot on her face as she
carefully poked and sifted through a powdery ash, digging up wine
glasses that had melted into misshapen lumps, uncovering shards of
china, then moving on, foot by foot.
</P>
<P>
   She was looking for something in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my wedding ring,'' she said, and kept on digging.
</P>
<P>
   Even as wildfires raged in counties in northeastern and central
Florida, firefighters, blessed with a few scattered rain showers,
less dry wind and a higher humidity over the weekend, began gaining
ground in fire-ravaged areas instead of just grimly holding it. As
the smoke cleared, those here returned to find the result of the
roaring, popping orange flames that had forced evacuations in
scenes that have haunted the state since May.
</P>
<P>
   In Mims, a small town in Brevard County near Florida's east
central coast, hundreds of people returned to their homes this
weekend. A dozen or so, like the Callahans on Golden Shores Drive,
lost everything they could not hurriedly stuff into their car.
Others, like Frank Kirkland in the Hog Valley neighborhood near
Interstate 95, came home to find some yards and outbuildings
burned, but found with relief that firefighters had killed the
blaze just as it touched their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't been standing right there,'' almost with their
backs to his mobile home, ``it wouldn't be here,'' said Kirkland,
who used to work at the Kennedy Space Center and now raises deer
dogs and pot-bellied pigs.
</P>
<P>
   And still others, like the Mayhew family just outside Mims,
defied evacuation orders and fought the wildfire themselves,
pumping water from a nearby pond and saving a cluster of mobile
homes, although, as 21-year-old Donnie Mayhew said, it almost
seemed as if the fire was determined to have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd put it out in one place and it would come at us from
someplace else,'' Mayhew said. ``I've never seen fire like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has, at least here.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said 1,946 fires have
burned 458,288 acres since June 1, causing an estimated $276
million in damage _ the worst disaster since Hurricane Andrew _ and
injuring 95 people, mostly firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   In the area around Mims and nearby Scottsmoor, about 15 miles
south of the Kennedy Space Center, at least 30 houses have been
destroyed, as about 60 fires continued to burn in the surrounding
county.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, in Flagler County, a mandatory evacuation of
30,000 people remained in effect, as people waited in shelters and
wondered what they would find back home.
</P>
<P>
   People here hope for rain, maybe even a tropical storm, but any
heavy rain _ if it comes at all _ is still days away, forecasters
say.
</P>
<P>
   In Mims, a part of Florida where orange groves, dense scrub and
green inlets provide scenery for U.S. Highway 1, retirees,
blue-collar workers and charter boat captains have watched for days
as the flames threatened five-bedroom dream homes and double-wide
trailers, which were dream houses, too, for some here. Black smut
streaked several roofs of the houses still standing, and vinyl
siding hung wrinkled and warped from others.
</P>
<P>
   Bedsheets, tied to fences and mailboxes, flapped softly in the
faint breeze. ``Thank You, Firefighters,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   And here and there are big piles of ash, where the flames either
attacked houses before firefighters could get there, or, in the
case of a few, drove them away when they did. That is what happened
to the Callahan house, where it got so hot firefighters had to
throw down their hoses and run. They returned a while later, to
apologize. But they did not have to.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, who served in Vietnam, said he did not want anyone to
get hurt trying to save things that could be replaced. He and his
wife and daughter, 21-year-old Naomi, were fine. So were their two
dogs, two cats and a bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're luckier than other people,'' said Callahan. Some
material things, of course, could not be replaced. ``All my
medals,'' he said. ``But hell, I know what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hog Valley, a more rural road where acres of palmettos are
now blackened nubs, Donnie Mayhew sat in deep shade and described
the wildfire that left the landscape this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought it ourselves,'' he said, but he wasn't bragging.
``We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   It began, last week, as a glow in the distance. Then, quickly,
it was racing toward the cluster of mobile homes where Mayhew, his
father, Bill, and other family and friends live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear it coming, crackling and roaring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no steadily marching line of flame. It burned
erratically as the wind shifted and swirled, and new fires sprang
up.
</P>

   His family had a pond, a pump and a generator to run it. The
generator saved them, after the fires burned down the power poles.

   They sprayed the houses and then focused on the fire line
itself, but every time it would seem like they had won, ``the wind
would shift, and it would come at us from the other end.''

   Like a lot of people here, everything they have is contained in
the aluminum walls of those mobile homes.

   ``We were going to stay until we couldn't stay no more,'' said
Mayhew.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Frank Kirkland dumped a bucketful of water
over the head of a pot-bellied pig named Little Bit. The fire had
reached up to the wire of the pen she shared with three babies,
and, apparently, just stopped. She snorted gratefully as the cool
water trickled over her ears.

   His emotions were mixed. The firefighters saved his mobile home
at the very last minute but the flames destroyed a building he
called ``my pavilion.''

<P>
   ``I had a TV, five picnic tables, a jukebox,'' he said. He had
planned a big party for the Fourth of July, and had stored two
whole hogs in a refrigerator, planning to barbecue them.

<P>
   He opened the refrigerator and gazed down at the meat that had
sizzled inside the freezer as the flames roared around it.

   ``Didn't get good and done,'' he said, as the stench of rotting
meat filled the air.

   For others, there were no mixed blessings, only a feeling that
something terrible had passed them by.

   In the shade of a tree near U.S. 1, three firefighters from
Okeechobee _ part of the hundreds who have come here from around
the state and country _ rested between emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   A man they had never seen walked up and thanked them. ``You guys
saved my house, twice,'' said Chet Richards, shaking their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters, Steve Weeks, Jim Fusco and Herb Smith, said it
is something that happens a lot to the firefighters here.
</P>
<P>
   A woman drove up and asked them if they were hungry, and left
them with bags of food and a giant tub of chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk around the corner without somebody bringing you
food,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   It makes it worthwhile, the men said, when it seems like the
ground underneath is about to melt their feet.

`REDNECK' RESTAURANT HAS POTENTIAL FOR INVESTORS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK VEVERKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
You might be a ``redneck'' if ... you invested in comedian Jeff
Foxworthy's nascent restaurant and barbecue sauce company.
<TEXT>
<P>
   More important, you might be a fool when you consider the fates
of Boston Chicken, Planet Hollywood and Kenny Rogers Roasters, the
latter of which is in Chapter 11. They're all publicly held
restaurant chains that have burned long-term investors. So, the
safe thing would be to take a pass on Redneck Foods of Asheville,
N.C.
</P>
<P>
   But if you still have barbecue on the brain after the holiday
weekend and have a penchant for risk, you might want to take a
flier on Redneck Foods (RDNK). Its 1.9 million public shares are
trading over the counter at just less than $3 after peaking at
around $4.
</P>
<P>
   OK, perhaps I got too close to the fireworks over the weekend or
sampled too much sauce, but Redneck's shares could be a compelling
growth play.
</P>
<P>
   For all of their faults, a bundle of money was made on the
upward trajectory of restaurant companies Boston Chicken and
Rainforest Cafe.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, &UR;  &LR; calling the top of the stock is the name of the
game. Boston Chicken now is running from the farmer's ax, trading
at around $1, and Rainforest is off about 45 percent from its
all-time high of $25.33 in December.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Redneck literally is just getting off the ground. It
only has one store, which opened in April near the entrance of
DisneyWorld in Florida. And early reports on the food and concept
are promising.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's crowded all of the time,'' says regular customer Leonard
Jagnandan, an operations manager for a Miami food distributor.
</P>
<P>
   While a lot can go wrong between now and 450 restaurants,
Redneck has some intriguing possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   The company is a combination play. It's both a celebrity-driven
concept, a la Planet Hollywood, Hard Rock Cafe or All Star Cafe,
and a fast-food chain rolled into one.
</P>
<P>
   The key difference is that its goal is to become a national
chain of fast-food restaurants that sells affordable barbecue ribs,
chicken and pork meals. That's different from its sagging big-box
celebrity cafe rivals that are tourist destinations in major
cities, says Redneck President David Womick.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not be selling $30 T-shirts and $10 burgers, Womick
says.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Redneck plans to keep keep average tabs less than a $8
head so that it can get repeat business from families.
</P>
<P>
   Womick, incidentally, came up with the concept and approached
Foxworthy through his agent. He brings to the table solid
restaurant experience as a director for Arby's International and an
owner of franchised restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Redneck's sells T-shirts and caps because merchandise
margins can be far more lucrative than those of food. So far,
nonfood revenues account for 17 percent of store sales, with
T-shirts starting at $12.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the restaurants, Redneck is rolling out a line of
branded foods. The company already supplies Wal-Mart with its Jeff
Foxworthy-brand barbecue sauces, which will be sold through the
Arkansas discounter's ``super center'' grocery stores.
</P>
<P>
   And if you're wondering if the sauces are any good, two of
Redneck's three sauces took awards at the National Barbecue
Association's annual blind-tasting in February in Arlington, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Redneck has a recognizable brand and spokesman in
Foxworthy. Although his recent TV series recently was canceled, the
affable comedian from Atlanta has an incredibly loyal following.
</P>
<P>
   His comedy CDs and books are top-sellers, and his mug is all
over the tube. He has a current HBO special, and his stand-up act
plays to full houses.
</P>
<P>
   Foxworthy may be the perfect pitchman for Redneck. He is a
self-confessed barbecue addict who insists that the food be fresh
and the sauces be tangy. ``I didn't want (the restaurants) to be
cheesy,'' Foxworthy says.
</P>
<P>
   More than his image is at stake. Although Foxworthy has not
pumped any cash into the deal, he holds a 25 percent equity stake
in Redneck. He has a contract that commits him to only four
personal appearances at stores per year. But Womick says that he
has a verbal commitment from the star to visit every restaurant
until ``there's so many that we make him squeal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are numerous other risks. Redneck is a bulletin board
stock that can't qualify for Nasdaq until its price rises above $4
and the company lists assets of $4 million. As of October,
Redneck's assets were $800,000.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the company expects to grow through acquisition and
franchising. While buying existing chains can be less expensive
than opening new stores from scratch, it also is more difficult to
create a consistent level of quality and service chain-wide.
</P>
<P>
   Womick says an acquisition is in the works and that Redneck will
have 30 restaurants by the end of the year. Eight will be
company-owned, and 22 will be owned by franchisees.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential pitfall with Redneck's strategy is that Womick
plans to simultaneously develop a second concept called
``Smokehouse Grille,'' which will be larger and more upscale.
Launching a nationwide chain of fast-food restaurants is one thing,
but trying to develop steak houses on the side seems like more than
a full plate. Womick, though, believes that he can pull it off. ``I
think I'm right on target,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Between Womick's hubris and Foxworthy's humor, it boils down to
the combined performances of two of the company's largest
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Says Foxworthy:``I don't want this to be another Kenny Rogers
Roasters.''

COMMENTARY: THE ENGINE OF LAW 
</HEADLINE>
  (See related analysis, CLINTON-CHINA-ASSESS) 
(lb) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the agreements reached on President Clinton's China visit
was to move ahead quickly on what he and President Jiang Zemin
called the rule of law initiative. It drew little attention, but it
has the potential to be an engine of change in China.
</P>
<P>
   The initiative calls for cooperation between the two countries
on the training of lawyers and judges, legal aid for the poor and
numerous other subjects. The stated aim is to improve Chinese legal
institutions: the courts, law schools, the bar, the administrative
bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   There are detailed plans. But the whole _ the idea _ is more
important than the sum of its parts. For thinking about law in a
changing China throws interesting light on that society, and on our
own understanding of law as an essential condition of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Law in China? Some Americans will react skeptically to the very
notion. What role can law play, they would ask, in an authoritarian
state whose Communist Party government does not tolerate dissent?
But that is too simple a view of law's present and potential place
in China.
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times correspondent, Elisabeth Rosenthal, described
in an April report how more and more ordinary people in China are
suing those with power over them: employers, state enterprises, the
police. The lawsuits challenge forces that do not usually have to
account for the use of their power.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the plaintiffs quite often win. That encourages more
people to sue, and more lawyers to represent them, even though the
law is frequently unclear and the courts unpredictable. The number
of lawyers in the country has grown from 2,000 in 1979 to 100,000
today. In the same period the number of law schools has gone from
two to more than 100.
</P>
<P>
   Why would the leadership want more meaningful legal institutions
in China, more law and lawyers? The answer must be found, I think,
in the need to which Jiang gave so much emphasis in his joint press
conference with Clinton: the need for stability.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who visits China even briefly senses in all kinds of
people, in the ruling class and outside, a fear of chaos. It is
such a huge and populous country, difficult to hold together under
any system. And it has had a recent example of chaos, the Cultural
Revolution, that is in just about everyone's mind as a horror that
must not be repeated.
</P>
<P>
   Law is the natural antidote to chaos. But arbitrary diktat from
the center _ the Maoist sense of law _ does not fit what China has
become in recent years. It does not fit a society that encourages
the entrepreneurial spirit, that lets people choose where they will
work and how they will live.
</P>
<P>
   It has to be a more diverse, more responsive law. That means law
administered by courts, developing just rules in the course of
deciding individual cases _ as English judges developed the common
law of property, contracts and torts, and American judges the law
of the Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed plans will bring Chinese judges to the United States and
American judges, including Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy,
to China. There will be a symposium on legal protection of human
rights. American law books will be translated into Chinese. Chinese
lawyers will learn about securities regulation and corporate law.
</P>
<P>
   One should not be too romantic about all this. China is not
America. Its rulers will want in the end to assure their own
position.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, law has a way of working into the bloodstream of a
society. It meets the fundamental human desire for both freedom and
order.
</P>
<P>
   At Beijing University, Clinton said: ``Freedom strengthens
stability. ... A greater respect for divergent political and
religious convictions will actually breed stability.'' Yes, but it
took a long time for us to understand that. Only in the middle of
this century did the Supreme Court read the First Amendment to
protect dissent. It was a gradual process, the law slowly changing
in the direction of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   No doubt the Chinese leadership believes that stronger legal
institutions can be confined to economic matters. But professor
Paul Gewirtz of Yale Law School, who led the planning for the rule
of law initiative, said, ``I would bet the other way.''

DVD LEADS RACE FOR MOVIE DISCS, FOR NOW

 By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The companies backing DVD, the CD-size digital disc
that contains a feature-length movie, are boasting a lot these
days, telling anyone who will listen that their product is selling
faster than either compact-disc players or VCRs did at the
corresponding points after they were introduced.
</P>
<P>
   By late June, a little more than a year after the introduction
of DVDs, manufacturers had sold nearly 600,000 DVD players. By
comparison, in March 1985, 16 months after the compact disc was
introduced, only 320,000 players had been sold. For VCRs in
September 1979, the number was 515,000.
</P>
<P>
   As pleased as equipment makers and Hollywood studio executives
are, some acknowledge that in some ways the achievement is hollow
because DVD is in a race for its survival, sprinting to gain a
significant foothold in American homes ahead of two headstrong
rivals. The odds of success are uncertain at best.
</P>
<P>
   One of the competitors is Divx, an upstart hybrid DVD format
that went on sale last month in two test markets, Richmond, Va.,
and San Francisco. A full-scale national introduction is scheduled
for September.
</P>
<P>
   But the other more important adversary is digital cable
television, which is expected to make picture-perfect, digital,
pay-per-view movies a ubiquitous feature in American homes within a
few years, said Warren Lieberfarb, president of Warner Home Video,
the largest distributor of DVDs.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is kind of a horse race, not just against Divx, but
against AT&AMP;T and TCI, against Comcast cable _ and the whole
migration to digital pay per view,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, AT&AMP;T Corp. agreed to buy Tele-Communications Inc.,
the United States' second-largest cable company, for $31.8 billion.
One goal of the merged company is to bring pay-per-view movies on
demand to millions of homes. Comcast Corp. and other cable
companies have similar plans, as do some broadcasters, after
digital broadcasting begins in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Lieberfarb fears that movies on demand will short-circuit the
sale of movies on discs. Why buy a DVD when you can dial up the
same movie on your television set whenever you want? The medium
will fail, he says, unless DVD is already an entrenched part of
family life, as VCRs are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have three years,'' he said. ``Three years from now
we need to be in 10 million homes.''
</P>
<P>
   That is a tall order, given that the industry has sold only
578,604 DVD players in the last 15 months, according to the
Consumer Electronics Manufacturers Association. Initial industry
projections were that 800,000 DVD players would sell in the first
year.
</P>
<P>
   DVD originally stood for digital videodisc. But that name was
abandoned when the designers realized that the discs could be used
for computer files and audio recordings, too, offering seven times
the storage capacity of CD-ROMs and CDs.
</P>
<P>
   Now the format is simply known as DVD. Though DVDs offer
high-resolution pictures and digital surround-sound, the format
faces its own daunting challenge: most Americans still know nothing
about it.
</P>
<P>
   A study commissioned by the Video Software Dealers Association,
which backs the format, found that 62 percent of those surveyed in
May had never heard of DVD. The study did find some improvement; in
a similar survey a year ago, the number was 81 percent. In the
latest survey, Yankelovich Partners interviewed 1,938 people, all
of whom were at least 18 and owned a VCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``Generally I think it shows that we are seeing an uptick in
consumer awareness,'' said Jeffrey Eves, association president.
</P>
<P>
   But Eves, Lieberfarb and many others worry that Divx (pronounced
DIV-ix) may stand in the way of further progress.
</P>
<P>
   Divx, a technology backed by the Circuit City chain of
electronics stores and a Los Angeles law firm, originally stood for
digital video express. But like DVD, the acronym has become the
name.
</P>
<P>
   Divx discs are DVDs with coding that allows them to be played
only once and only in special players. Zenith Corp. is making the
first player, which accommodates both Divx discs and regular DVDs
and sells for $499 _ a little more than the lowest-priced DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Each Divx disc costs $4.49, compared with about $25 for a DVD.
But if a viewer plays the Divx disc after an initial two-day
viewing period, the owner will be charged about $3. The accounting
is done by the Divx central computer, which is connected to the
Divx player by a phone line.
</P>
<P>
   When Circuit City announced the Divx concept last fall, it was
greeted with howls of vitriol from DVD supporters who complained
that the new format would confuse consumers and threaten the
success of DVD. Lieberfarb was among the most vocal critics.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints were so loud that some in the industry predicted
that Divx would never get off the ground _ especially because
Warner Bros. and a few other studios, including Columbia Tri-Star,
have refused to issue movies in the Divx format, fearing it would
undermine the success of DVD.
</P>
<P>
   But on June 7, Divx discs and players went on sale in 45 Circuit
City and Good Guys stores in Richmond and San Francisco. Circuit
City also began advertising Divx on television and in newspapers in
both places.
</P>
<P>
   Warner Home Video countered with a program to encourage video
stores in those two cities and three others to rent DVDs and DVD
players. The Yankelovich survey showed that most people wanted to
be able to rent DVDs just as they do videotapes. But video dealers
have been slow to stock the discs because few people own DVD
players.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Divx and Warner sales programs are so new that neither
company is ready to release results, though Richard Sharp, chief
executive of Circuit City Stores Inc., dismissively said: ``We've
been in some of their stores, and they are offering only about 40
titles'' for rent.
</P>
<P>
   But Sharp is able to do little better. As of Wednesday, only 45
movies were available in the Divx format. Sharp predicts the total
will be 400 by the end of the year. By comparison, 1,400 movies
were available on DVD on July 1; 180 of those were issued in June
alone.
</P>
<P>
   When Divx players go on sale nationally this fall, Circuit City
plans to begin a $100 million advertising campaign. Warner,
meanwhile, says it will offer its DVD rental program nationally in
the fall as well, though Lieberfarb said Warner and allied
companies would spend considerably less than $100 million.
</P>
<P>
   He thinks Divx, like DVD, must gain a foothold before
pay-per-view services proliferate. Sharp agrees but says he has
five years before that happens.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp predicts that Divx will succeed because the concept offers
several advantages that his research indicates consumers
appreciate. Chief among them is that for about the cost of renting
a videotape, a Divx buyer can take a disc home and keep it,
eliminating return trips to the video store and late fees.
</P>
<P>
   But those two attributes have turned out to be liabilities as
well. The nation's video-rental dealers hate Divx. ``It undermines
the entire business'' by reducing traffic in the stores, Eves said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, no video store has agreed to sell Divx discs. They
can be bought only at at Circuit City and Good Guys stores and the
Divx site on the Internet at www.divx.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're facing a kind of chicken-and-egg problem,'' Sharp said.
``In time, I think the power of the Divx format will overpower
this.''

   Playoff or not, pro tour can wait
</P>
<P>
   By Glenn Sheeley
</P>
<P>
   C. 1998 Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   KOHLER, Wis. _ Whatever happens in today's U.S. Women's Open
playoff, Duke's Jenny Chuasiriporn insists there will be no changes
to her amateur status. She might turn away Se Ri Pak today, but she
will not turn pro. Not yet, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really think about turning pro,'' said the 20-year-old
from Baltimore, Md., a senior this fall. ``I'm really looking
forward to my last year at Duke. ... I don't want to turn pro at
all.''
</P>
<P>
   The only amateur to win the U.S. Women's Open was Catherine
Lacoste in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn's original plans today were to join her fellow
Curtis Cup team members for four days of practice in Minnesota. She
had checked out of her Kohler hotel. Her parents, who operate a
restaurant in Baltimore called The Bangkok Palace, were headed
home. Now they will be hanging on every shot in the 18-hole playoff
with another 20-year-old, South Korea's Se Ri Pak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess we probably have the same amount of pressure because
she already has won her major,'' said Chuasiriporn, referring to
the McDonald's LPGA title Pak won in May. ``I never want to put too
many expectations on myself. I'm just out there to have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Pak is attempting to become the first rookie to win two majors
in a season since Juli Inkster in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Chuasiriporn was the 1997 winner of the Eastern Amateur, the
1996 and 1997 winner of the ACC championship and finished fifth in
the 1998 NCAAs. She also won this year's Harder Hall Invitational
and was runner-up in the North &AMP; South Women's Amateur.
</P>
<P>
   As if Sunday's 45-foot birdie putt that tied Pak was not
indication enough, Chuasiriporn's putter has been her most improved
weapon since the NCAAs. ``I was really just trying to get
comfortable with one stroke because I was wavering between
different styles,'' she said. ``I think I've finally kind of
figured it out.''
</P>
<P>
   LPGA courses too easy?
</P>
<P>
   Why was everybody complaining about tough conditions at
Blackwolf Run? Most LPGA players, said Sweden's Helen Alfredsson,
are spoiled with the easier conditions at the average LPGA tour
stop.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it's tough, why is it crazy?'' Alfredsson said. ``Yes,
it's a course where every time you hit a shot, you go, `Phew!' But
in order to get better, sometimes you have to get tougher, not
easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfredsson tied for the day's low round with a 73 during
Saturday's windy, wild conditions and tied for 13th Sunday with a
another 73, finishing at 12-over. She suggested that low scores on
the LPGA ``are not necessarily indicative that we're playing well,
but that courses might be too easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Saying the score is ``all relative,'' Alfredsson had no problem
with a Women's Open champion finishing several shots over par
``unless you (media) guys make us look like idiots by saying we
can't play because we're women.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta's Rosie Jones, who had a relatively strong weekend with
scores of 74-76 and tied for 19th at 298, was not in total
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thursday and Friday they (the USGA) made it so tough,'' she
said, ``it made you a little scared going into the weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lets it slip away
</P>
<P>
   Chris Johnson was at 6-over par with five holes to play and in
good position, but double-bogeyed the 14th and bogeyed the 15th.
Earlier, she doubled the ninth hole. ``I had some chances,'' she
said after tying for fourth at 8-over 292, ``and I didn't make the
most of them.'' ... Danielle Ammaccapane, who closed with a 71,
also finished 8-over after bogeying the 18th, but somehow decided,
``You know what, shooting even par on this golf course, especially
on Sunday, I'm just thrilled.''

<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ The British government used
hundreds of combat-ready army troops and Northern Ireland policemen
Sunday to prevent several thousand Protestants from marching, as
Protestants have since 1807, through a small Roman Catholic enclave
in this town.
</P>
<P>
   The government acted to prevent clashes between the Catholic
minority and the Protestant majority in this predominantly
Protestant British province.
</P>
<P>
   The marchers, members of the patriotic Orange Order wearing
black suits and orange sashes, dispersed after one of their leaders
walked up to a huge concrete roadblock and spoke a message of
protest through a high chain fence, blocking the road to the
Catholic area. But there was no one on the other side to listen.
</P>
<P>
   The government feared that the annual march might lead to
rioting and vandalism, as it did in the last three years.
Widespread violence could endanger the recently approved peace
agreement, which spells out drastic political reforms that will
give Catholics more power in the North.
</P>
<P>
   The government was clearly gambling that this year would be
different, that Protestants, many of whom voted for the peace
agreement in a referendum in May, would be less angry at Catholics
and the government now than in 1996, when the province was racked
in turmoil for four days and night.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a government ban on the march through the Drumcree enclave
was announced several days beforehand, but the decision was
reversed because Protestant rioters wreaked millions of dollars of
property damage. The Protestant violence and the decision to let
them march provoked retaliation by Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the British official in charge of Northern Ireland,
Mo Mowlam, agreed and allowed the march after police forcibly
lifted protesting Catholics, often roughly, from the road. But this
year, approving the ban, she said that the rights of the
Protestants and Catholics had to be balanced.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps 200 marchers remained quietly on the side of a hill
between the Church of Ireland church at Drumcree, where they had
attended an annual service. The Orangemen, and a few women, looked
across a small stream, its banks scooped steeper by British
diggers, at several rows of four-foot-high barbed wire coils and
armed security forces. Many said it looked like a battlefield from
a World War II movie.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only God will save us,'' said the Rev. John Pickering, who
spoke to the church's congregation before it left to confront
British officials. But no officials, not even a soldier or a
policeman, were at the roadblock.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a total disgrace,'' said Harold Gracey, head of the
local Orange Order. ``We'll stay here until we are allowed our
legitimate right to walk on the road.''
</P>
<P>
   An hour after he spoke, most Orangemen had left the area, but
some set up a British Union Jack and a white Ulster flag on the
side of the stream, facing the security forces about 500 yards
away.
</P>
<P>
   Two men not wearing Orange Order regalia were arrested after
they made a brief attempt to cross the barbed wire. Several tents
were put up by people who said they intended to stay all night.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday night, Protestants protesting the ban on the march
created disturbances in Belfast and other towns. Some roads and
streets were blocked, bus service in Belfast was suspended and a
few cars were burned, police said. There also were instances of
youths throwing stones at policemen, but police said there were no
reports of clashes between Protestants and Catholics and no serious
injuries reported.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Catholics in Drumcree, Breandan MacCionnaith,
urged Catholics to be wary of Protestants trying to sneak through
the British lines to demonstrate. His warning seemed intended to
keep the issue alive politically, as the area is ringed with
troops, policemen, armored Land Rovers and Saxon military troop
carriers.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The all-male Protestant Orange Order says that marching is a
matter of freedom of assembly, a basic democratic right. Generally,
the 3,000 Protestant parades held each summer celebrate the victory
at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690, of the Protestant William of
Orange over his father-in-law, King James II. The victory
established the Protestant Ascendancy, and British rule in Ireland.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics feel that the marches, only a handful of which are
contentious, are offensive and triumphalist as the Orangemen strut
stiffly by to the martial music of loud drums. Only one group, the
Edgarstown Drum and Accordion Band, marched up to the roadblock
Sunday, thumping and wheezing its martial airs through the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the marchers Sunday milled around, chatting, even
smiling, looking at the gray sky threatening rain, seeing a single
police helicopter hovering at about 1,000 feet.
</P>
<P>
   One angry man explained why Orangemen refused to negotiate with
Mr. MacConnaith, the Catholic leader, identifying him as ``the one
who blew up the Legion Hall in Thomas Street.'' MacCionnaith served
time in a British prison as an Irish Republican Army operative
convicted for his role in the destruction of the British social
club hall in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   Notably absent Sunday was David Trimble, an Orangeman and leader
of the Ulster Unionist Party, who was chosen last Wednesday as
First Minister of the new Northern Ireland Assembly, the engine of
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
   Trimble, now committed to trying to cooperate with Catholics in
political reforms, was a star of the 1995 Drumcree march when he
raised his arm in triumph after walking past the Catholic homes.

   CHIHUAHUA, Mexico _ Voters in three northern states cast ballots
Sunday in hard-fought gubernatorial elections viewed as a crucial
early test of opposition chances to defeat President Ernesto
Zedillo's governing party in presidential voting two years from
now.
</P>
<P>
   Election officials said hundreds of polling places in those
states _ Chihuahua, Durango and Zacatecas _ did not open until
midmorning because election materials were not delivered by the
scheduled 8 a.m. opening time and some polling booth captains
overslept.
</P>
<P>
   There were no reports at all on early balloting from dozens of
rural communities because downpours knocked out telephone service
across much of the Sierra Madre.
</P>
<P>
   Election authorities reported no major disruptions or disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Official results were not expected until Monday. But there were
signs of a potential upset in Zacatecas, a mining center of 1.3
million people where Zedillo's governing Institutional
Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, has never lost a
gubernatorial election. Ricardo Monreal, the candidate of the
leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, or PRD, was running
ahead of his rivals, according to preliminary results of an exit
poll conducted by the national television network, TV Azteca.
</P>
<P>
   The news director of TV Azteca, Sergio Sarmiento, said the poll
indicated that in Durango the governing party's candidate, Sergio
Guerrero Mier, was leading his rivals by a small margin.
</P>
<P>
   The elections in Chihuahua had the most symbolic importance,
because Gov. Francisco Barrio is from the National Action Party,
known as the PAN, and the president's party had poured national
resources into the state in an attempt to orchestrate a showcase
victory. The Chihuahua elections were the party's only chance
before the presidential vote in two years to recapture an
opposition-controlled statehouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the Chihuahua race the two main candidates were Patricio
Martinez, 50, a congressman from the president's party who was
mayor of the Chihuahua state capital from 1992 to 1995, and Ramon
Galindo, 41, of PAN, who stepped down as mayor of Ciudad Juarez
this year to run for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Sarmiento said TV Azteca's exit polls indicated that Martinez
and Galindo were separated by a tiny figure, within the margin of
error.
</P>
<P>
   In public opinion polls Martinez took a strong lead after his
nomination in March. Although Galindo reduced the margin in the
four-month campaign, he was never able to pull past the his
opponent in the surveys.
</P>
<P>
   The final pre-election poll by a Ciudad Juarez newspaper, Norte,
in the last week of June, said that Martinez was favored by 38
percent of the voters and that Galindo was favored by 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Esther Orozco, 53, an award-winning biologist who
represented the leftist Party of the Democratic Revolution, was
backed by 7 percent of the voters in Chihuahua, according to the
Norte pre-election poll. Some 14 percent of Chihuahua voters were
undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The PRI has controlled the presidency and most state and local
posts since its founding in 1929 by generals who fought in the
revolution from 1910 to 1917. In many elections since, including
the 1976 presidential vote that Jose Lopez Portillo won, the
party's candidates have run unopposed. Many other victories for the
party have resulted from skullduggery or outright fraud.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Since 1991, when President Carlos Salinas de Gortari recognized
the first opposition gubernatorial victory, by a PAN candidate in
Baja California, the opposition has won six statehouses, and
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the leftist party was elected last year to
be mayor of the Mexico City Federal District. The combined votes of
five opposition parties constitute a slim majority in the 500-seat
Chamber of Deputies, although they do not always vote together
against the president's party, which has an outright majority in
the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of the elections in Chihuahua lays partly in the
central role of that state _ which borders west Texas and is
Mexico's largest in terms of territory _ in the opposition's
15-year struggle to end the governing party's domination.
</P>
<P>
   The election in 1983 of Barrio of the National Action Party as
mayor of Ciudad Juarez, the state's largest city, helped to make
the opposition's first broad inroads against the governing party's
power in several northern states. Three years later, in 1986, when
Barrio made his first run for governor, authorities from the
governing party gave the victory to his opponent from their party,
ignoring accusations of fraud lodged by international observers.
</P>
<P>
   Barrio led a hunger strike, and hundreds of followers carried
out months of protests across Chihuahua, at one point shutting down
the international bridge linking Ciudad Juarez and El Paso. When
Barrio ran again in 1992, Salinas recognized his victory.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters credited Barrio Sunday with improving public
administration in Chihuahua in his six-year term, which ends this
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The PAN has carried on a great war against corruption in
Chihuahua,'' said Gonzalo Solis, a mathematics professor at a local
university here, who said he voted for Galindo.
</P>
<P>
   But a civil engineer, Jorge Soto, said he cast his vote for the
governing party, faulting Barrio for allowing crime to run out of
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our main problem here are all the narcotics and the insecurity
that comes from violent crimes, a lot of them even carried out by
teen-agers now,'' Soto said. ``And the PAN hasn't been able to
resolve this.''
</P>
<P>
   The elections open a 12-month season in which 15 states will
choose governors.
</P>
<P>
   ``These elections will give us a much closer reading on the
relative power of the three parties,'' Emilio Zebadua, a political
scientist in Mexico City, said. ``And because they'll have a
psychological influence on the way voters see the parties, they'll
affect the presidential elections in the year 2000.''

SAMPRAS SQUEAKS OUT A 5TH WIMBLEDON TITLE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ Pete Sampras is a historical, not
hysterical, sort of guy. He reacted to his latest triumph on
Wimbledon's Center Court, the garden spot that has now provided
five of his 11 Grand Slam championships and left him one Slam title
shy of equaling Roy Emerson's career record, with consummate
restraint.
</P>
<P>
   First he put a conciliatory arm around the shoulders of
Croatia's despondent Goran Ivanisevic, the combustible serving
machine he outlasted, 6-7 (2-7), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-2, in a
thoroughly tense finale in which the defending champion twice
eluded set points that would have given Ivanisevic a potentially
bulletproof two sets-to-none lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for Goran,'' Sampras said. ``I've lost a couple of
Grand Slam finals, and it's the toughest defeat in tennis. There
was almost nothing that separated Goran and I at this stage of the
tournament. I just managed to squeak this one out.''
</P>
<P>
   Once Ivanisevic settled into his change-over chair and put a
towel over his head like a blindfold, Sampras felt free to step
onto the court that has been kindest to him in his superlative
career and celebrate this Wimbledon title. It was a championship
that tied him with Bjorn Borg not just here at Wimbledon, but on
the career list for men's Grand Slam titles. Martina Navratilova
holds the record in women's Grand Slam events.
</P>
<P>
   Up went Sampras' arms and, for the first time in nearly three
hours, he proved he had teeth in his mouth when he unclenched his
jaw and cast a relieved glance in the direction of his girlfriend,
Kimberly Williams, and coach, Paul Annacone. He finally felt it was
safe to smile.
</P>
<P>
   With this historic 11th Grand Slam title, the 26-year-old
Sampras, who maintains that his Slam career is far from finished,
tied his original role model, Rod Laver, and Borg. Sampras had
always expressed quiet confidence that he would play this game long
enough to break Emerson's record, which could happen as soon as the
1999 Australian Open if he commandeers a fifth U.S. Open title
later this summer. But he seemed genuinely stunned at equaling
Borg's record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to take a little bit of time to sink in; as a kid,
when I saw Borg's five, I never thought I would be in a position to
tie it, and it's a little overwhelming to think about,'' said
Sampras, who had not passed a Slam quarterfinal since his fourth
Wimbledon crown last year _ a minor slump for a player of his
repute.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I guess I'm out of my slump,'' he said, playing down his
reaction to the criticism that accompanied him at this tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't avoid it,'' he said of the comments, some of them
from fellow players, regarding his inauspicious 1998 season and
apparently sagging motivation. ``But my goal here was to try to
win, and I wasn't going to let any wasted emotion overtake that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras termed it a footnote that this title also resolidified
his position as No. 1 in the world. That designation would have
gone to Chile's Marcelo Rios had Ivanisevic imitated Jana Novotna,
Wimbledon's 1998 women's champion, and finally broken through on
his third attempt to win this title.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, whose fifth Wimbledon title arrived on the 18th
anniversary of Borg's record fifth consecutive championship, had
zipped through a dress rehearsal for Sunday's match when he
defeated the Croat here in straight sets for the 1994 title. But
the reprise was not easy.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who likens these duels with Ivanisevic to
roller-coaster rides, had anticipated a rough trip, and he got one:
This was the first time that Sampras, now 11-2 in Grand Slam
finals, was stretched to a fifth set.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Luckily for him, the 14th-seeded Ivanisevic had soldiered
through a 15-13 fifth set in his semifinal upset of Richard
Krajicek, the 1996 Wimbledon champion. Once Sampras and his
challenger ventured into five-set territory Sunday, the fatigued
Croat, who managed to deliver just two of his 32 aces in the
deciding set, all but raised a white flag.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the fifth set, gone; my legs were not there,'' said
Ivanisevic, who traced his miseries to his failure to convert
either of the two match points he held on serve in the fourth set
of his epic against Krajicek. ``That cost me this final today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, I had the chance, because he didn't play well. In
'94, we play two sets, and then the third set, he killed me,'' the
Croat said of his 0-6 no-show in the final set of his 1994
Wimbledon final against Sampras. ``But today was very close, a lot
of everything, it was interesting, but now it's the worst moment of
my life. You know, I've had some bad moments, when you are sick or
when somebody dies, but for me this is the worst thing ever,
because nobody's died yet.''
</P>
<P>
   He then implied that this was the kind of loss that turns
players like him suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can only kill myself, I can't cheer anybody now,'' said
Ivanisevic, referring to his sudden inability to get excited about
Croatia's surge to the World Cup semifinals. After using this Grand
Slam event to cure a slump that was far more debilitating than
Sampras' (coming into this event, Ivanisevic had stumbled in the
opening round of three straight Grand Slam events and seen his
ranking plummet to No. 24, a faux pas overlooked by Wimbledon's
selective seeding committee), Ivanisevic was inconsolable after
falling just short in the final. And Sampras understood why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the match slipping away in the second-set tie
breaker,'' Sampras admitted. ``I thought, `God, this could be
Goran's year.' There was a shot he missed by about an inch, I was
down some set points, he hits some second serves, and if he
converts on one of those, it's two sets to love and I'm digging
myself a big hole.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of making that mistake, Sampras, whose slow start was
evident in his being out-aced by 13-0 in the first set, came up
with service winners to the backhand side on both of Ivanisevic's
set points in the second-set tie breaker and converted his third
set point when the Croat netted a forehand return.
</P>
<P>
   Using that momentum, Sampras broke Ivanisevic with a crosscourt
backhand return to go ahead, 3-2, in the third set and went on to
win it with an ace. But the Croat reasserted himself with three
beautiful running forehand passing shots and took a 4-2 lead in the
fourth set, which he pocketed with an ace of his own to send the
match to the fifth set.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras went up by 5-2 there and, slightly to his surprise,
broke his exhausted opponent at love for the title.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't take these titles for granted,'' Sampras said, ``and
compared to all the finals I've played, this is by far the
toughest. I didn't think I was quite in control of the match, and
Goran was playing huge. In fact, he's going to win this event, I
feel. His game is too big and his serve is too big and I would be
frustrated if I was in his shoes.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Pete Sampras, 16-year-old Serena Williams isn't chasing
history quite yet; instead, she's trying to keep up with her
18-year-old sister, Venus, who already owns a pair of mixed-doubles
Grand Slam titles with Justin Gimelstob. On Sunday the younger
Williams and her new partner, Max Mirnyi of Belarus, defeated
fifth-seeded Mirjana Lucic and Mahesh Bhupathi, 6-4, 6-4, to claim
the mixed doubles title. In the women's doubles final, the
top-seeded partnership of Jana Novotna, this year's singles
champion, and Martina Hingis, last year's singles champion,
defeated second-seeded Lindsay Davenport and Natasha Zvereva, 6-3,
3-6, 8-6.

GENTLE ZEPHYR FORCES CONE TO ALTER STRATEGY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ David Cone played Yankee Stadium Sunday like a golfer
might have. It was as if he lugged a few blades of grass to the top
of the mound, flipped them upward, read the gusting air currents
and adjusted his pitching to honor the whims of Mother Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Realizing that a heavy crosswind would minimize the
effectiveness of three of his primary pitches, Cone changed his
approach and pitched eight innings in the Yankees' 1-0 shutout of
Baltimore, before 52,506, becoming the American League's second
12-game winner. In completing a three-game sweep of the Orioles,
the Yankees improved their record to 61-20, matching the best mark
of the 20th century, previously established by the 1902 Pittsburgh
Pirates and the 1907 Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees already have an 11-game lead in the AL East, ahead
of Boston; they lead the Orioles (38-50), who were thought to be
their biggest challenge, by 26{ games, 30 games in the loss column.
After returning Thursday from the three-day All-Star Game break
that begins Sunday, the Yankees need to win only 39 of their final
81 games to achieve 100 victories.
</P>
<P>
   It does not seem to matter who plays for the Yankees, or who
does not play: so long as they wear pinstripes, they will win.
Already Manager Joe Torre was without Bernie Williams, the injured
center fielder, and Chuck Knoblauch and slugger Darryl Strawberry,
both of whom were nursing sore knees. Nevertheless, Torre decided
to give third baseman Scott Brosius a day off. The Yankees'
starting lineup included Dale Sveum, the seldom-used utility
infielder who has seven hits this season; Luis Sojo, making his
third start at second base this year, and rookie outfielder Ricky
Ledee, who likely will be returned to Class AAA Columbus once
Williams returns.
</P>
<P>
   And yet they found a way to win. The Yankees forced Scott
Erickson, Baltimore's hard-throwing sinkerballer, to throw 29
pitches in the first inning, and with one out in the third, Sojo
bounced a grounder off Erickson's glove for an infield single. Paul
O'Neill lined a single to left-center field, and Sojo took third.
Tino Martinez then battled Erickson for 10 pitches, fouling off
five before striking out, and Tim Raines walked after a 7-pitch
at-bat, filling the bases. Already Erickson had thrown 64 pitches
in two and two-thirds innings, 27 in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Facing Chad Curtis, Erickson threw a slider with his first
pitch, and it was high, far off target, evidence that he was weary
from working so long in the inning. Mike Flanagan, the pitching
coach, went to the mound to give Erickson a breather.
</P>
<P>
   But Erickson's next pitch grazed Curtis' left shoulder,
ricocheting off Curtis' left hand, to force home Sojo. Like a boxer
recovering from an early knockdown, Erickson recovered the next
inning and mowed down the Yankees the rest of the day. ``By the
fourth or fifth inning, I knew that one run might just about be
it,'' Cone said.

<P>
   One would be enough for Cone _ remarkably, catcher Joe Girardi
said later, noting that Cone's stuff was quite ordinary. As he
warmed up before the game, Cone noticed immediately that the wind
was blowing from left to right, from the Yankees' dugout on the
first-base side to the Baltimore dugout on the third-base side, and
it was hampering the movement on his slider, his forkball and his
four-seam fastball. ``He had to do a little inventing,'' Girardi
said.
</P>
<P>
   Cone is used to changing according to weather conditions: he
prefers the heat and loses his grip in extreme cold. Sunday he
changed his arm angle repeatedly, altered the timing of his
delivery from pitch to pitch and threw more sinking fastballs and
different styles of breaking balls, pitches that worked with the
wind currents, rather than against them. And the Yankees'
meteorologist dominated.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed only seven hits, walked none _ he has not walked a
batter in his last three starts, encompassing 24 innings _ and
always overcame challenges. The Orioles were 0-for-6 with runners
in scoring position; over Cone's last eight starts, opponents are
5-for-37 (.132) with runners in scoring position.
</P>
<P>
   It was Girardi who came the closest to knocking out Cone, in the
eighth: as Girardi fired a throw to second base on an attempted
steal, the ball skimmed Cone's right ear. Cone got through the
inning and made a half-hearted attempt to persuade Torre to leave
him in for the ninth. But Mariano Rivera relieved for the ninth,
retired Baltimore in order and Yankees players showered and rushed
out of the clubhouse quickly, off to a well-deserved three days of
rest and relaxation.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees and Orioles, who have had their share of bad blood
and hit batsmen this season, engaged in another tete-a-tete in the
first inning Sunday. David Cone hit Brady Anderson in the leg in
the top of the first, and when the Yankees came to bat, Baltimore's
Scott Erickson threw his first pitch behind the back of Derek
Jeter. Ken Kaiser, the home-plate umpire, spoke sharply with
players from both teams and stemmed the ugliness. ... The Yankees'
rotation for the first five games after the All-Star Game break
will be Andy Pettitte, Hideki Irabu, David Cone, David Wells and
Orlando Hernandez _ which will allow Cone to get an extra day of
rest. ... The April 26 rainout with Detroit will be made up as part
of a twi-night doubleheader on Monday, July 20. The first pitch is
scheduled for 4:05 p.m. at Yankee Stadium.

COMMENTARY: THE REST IS HISTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EASTHAMPTON, N.Y. _ Letters, handwritten notes and the
contemporaneous recollections of yesterday's insiders helped us
understand ``the way it really was'' in America's past. But
technology, fear of prosecution and the blindness of publishers
threaten to deny tomorrow's historians access to this generation's
primary sources.
</P>
<P>
   The revealing personal letter of the past has been engulfed in
today's tide of telephonic chatter, short bursts of e-mail, and
computer revisions that leave no trace of editing's second
thoughts.
</P>
<P>
   ``Keep notes?'' a White House aide asked me incredulously, when
I expressed the hope that he would create the factual basis for a
memoir. ``They'd be subpoenaed in a minute. And your old boss
proved how taping can kill you.''
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the recollections of insiders, set down as soon as
possible after power passes, to show the motivation of leaders and
quirks of fate that shape our lives. Lately, the insiders have been
letting down the side.
</P>
<P>
   Where are the primary sources that gave us Robert E. Sherwood's
``Roosevelt and Hopkins'' or speechwriter Samuel Rosenman's
``Working with Roosevelt'' or ``The Secret Diaries of Harold
Ickes''? (If Ickes' son published a secret diary today, the whole
Chinese connection of the DNC might be marching off to jail.)
</P>
<P>
   What recent diplomats enlivened history with the human element
as did Dean Acheson and Henry Kissinger? Neither Jimmy Carter's
Cyrus Vance nor George Bush's James Baker illuminated the
landscape; Ronald Reagan's George Shultz did a solid job, but hopes
are low for Bill Clinton's Warren Christopher or security spinster
Sandy Berger. Maybe Strobe Talbott, a former Time columnist, will
season friendship with firsthand fact.
</P>
<P>
   President Bush, six years into retirement, is still fumbling
through his own book. Reagan's in-house historian, Edmund Morris,
has been laboring on an opus so magnum it will appear this fall
after more than a decade in preparation.
</P>
<P>
   Speechwriters have a special obligation to observe character,
report anecdote and explicate policy, as Peggy Noonan faithfully
did with Reagan and Bush. But Pat Buchanan, unique in his closeness
to both Nixon and Reagan, has written only about his own life and
ideas. David Gergen was also at the center in two administrations;
where's his inside account?
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps publishers need prodding. The last Nixon insider who
hasn't spilled anything is Ron Ziegler, who escaped the Inquisition
but was on the scene at the most dramatic administration's most
dramatic moments. He has notes, vivid memories, and the sense of
humor necessary for a book tour; maybe he needs an agent.
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Packwood diaries? Now that charges of
transgressions are seen by feminists to have been relatively mild
to the point of quaintness, his two-decade account of Senate
operations _ a book including a searchable compact disc, Pepysian
in its detail, inserted in the back cover _ would be an invaluable
resource for tomorrow's political scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of CDs, triangulator Richard Morris _ whose rushed-out
memoir was too much about himself, but who writes a lively weekly
column for ``the Hill'' _ has an archive on his computer recounting
notes he took of hundreds of meetings with Clinton and White House
aides, as well as drafts of speeches and political commercials.
Some prestigious university press should snap that up.
</P>
<P>
   Even though burdened with the fear of subpoenaed notes, Clinton
insiders should consider history as part of their permanent
campaign. Confidants like Bruce Lindsey and Sidney Blumenthal may
have to delay publication until the statutes of limitation run, but
the rush of voluntary revelations then should settle many questions
resolutely resisted now.
</P>
<P>
   George Stephanopoulos' sympathetic but not sycophantic book will
break the ice. Let's hear from Leon Panetta on the welfare-policy
turnaround, Ira Magaziner on Hillarycare, Mike McCurry or Betty
Currie on life inside the bunker, Charles Ruff on privilege,
Hickman Ewing on Ken Starr, John Huang on changing policy with
contributions, Madeleine Albright on Life With Holbrooke and
William Cohen's Pentagon Poems.
</P>
<P>
   Taken together with congressional reports and the Clintons'
memoirs, the fulfillment of the insiders' obligation to history
will give us a base on which to draw more profound judgments. Can't
wait.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saks Fifth Avenue, one of the most venerable names in
retail, said Sunday that it would be acquired for $2.1 billion by
Proffitt's Inc., a Southern retailing company that is all but
unknown to New York shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal would represent the end of an era for Saks,
whose founders, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel, probably never
imagined that the famous store on natty Fifth Avenue would one day
be part of a retail conglomerate based in Alcoa, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saks was founded in 1924, it has undergone several changes
of ownership, managing to escape the fate of many famous New York
stores. It avoided extinction, unlike B. Altman and Gimbel's, and
it was not swallowed up by a giant retail company, as was Macy's
when it was acquired by Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers on Fifth Avenue looking for the latest Gucci shoe,
the change of ownership will not be noticeable, but those living in
the Midwest, where some of Saks' less profitable stores are, may
see a different name above the door. And some of Proffitt's stores
may change their name to Saks. In fact, Proffitt's will rename
itself Saks Inc., seeking some of the glamour of the famous name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just one Saks Fifth Avenue, and the power of the
brand is exactly where retail is going,'' said Robert Bradley
Martin, Proffitt's chief executive, who will be the chairman and
chief executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger serves as a near-exit strategy for the largest
shareholder of Saks Holdings Inc., the Bahrain-based investment
company Investcorp International, which bought the retailer for
$1.6 billion in 1990 and had been hoping in recent years to make a
killing the way it did with other luxury investments like Tiffany &AMP;
Co. and Gucci Group.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bank initially sold 20 percent of Saks to the
public in 1995 for $425 million and followed up with another stock
offering, it now finds itself and its clients not cashing out as
they had hoped, but rather holding 12 percent of Proffitt's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on Thursday's closing stock prices, Investcorp and
other shareholders in Saks now own stock worth about 15 percent
more than last week, assuming shareholders of both companies
approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Proffitts does not seem to be the best match for
Saks. Proffitt's runs 234 stores that serve middle-income shoppers
in the South and Midwest with names like Proffitt's, Younkers,
Carson Pirie Scott, and Herbergers. Most of the stores resemble
Macy's in terms of what they sell _ lots of Tommy Hilfiger, Liz
Claiborne, Nine West and Estee Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   Saks has the opposite strategy at its 95 stores nationwide. Many
of the brands that Proffitt's specializes in were evicted from Saks
two years ago in an effort to give the retailer a tonier image. Its
staples are Gucci, Oscar de la Renta and Yves St. Laurent, all
names not carried even in Proffitt's most upscale store, Parisian.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of merchandise synergies, there are none,'' Martin
admitted. ``But we'll buy telecommunications, transportation, paper
supplies and other things at an enormous cost savings. This deal is
not built on merchandise synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's, which was founded in 1919 with a handful of stores
in Knoxville, Tenn., has built its fortunes on the success of
acquisitions. In the last three years, it has acquired a dizzying
seven names, including Carson Pirie Scott in the Midwest, and has
slowly built up a portfolio, creating $3.5 billion in revenue. As a
result of the acquisitions, sales and profit margins have risen
smartly as expenses have become lower.
</P>
<P>
   While the company was attracted to operational cost savings with
the Saks acquisition, it is also eager to tap into the Saks fashion
savvy that has been lacking at Proffitt's.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will form a product-development unit that will
build up private-label programs for all the divisions. Saks already
has a strong variety of private-label brands, and Proffitt's has
said that it wants 12 percent of its merchandise to be private
label.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the two stores now have access to each other's geographic
regions. Expanding on both coasts, for example, ``would be a good
supplement to what Proffitt's does in the Midwest,'' said Isaac
Lagnado, a retail consultant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans for the new company include greater international
use of the Saks name, an increase in the number of domestic stores,
and an expanded use of the database of Saks credit-card holders and
catalog shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's will keep its headquarters in Tennessee, while Saks
will be run more or less independent of the company's other
divisions, by its current management team out of New York.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Philip B. Miller, the chief executive of Saks, Brian
Kendrick, the retailer's chief operating officer, and Martin sat in
Miller's opulent office across the street from the company's
flagship store, talking of how enthusiastic they were about the
deal. ``Brad has demonstrated that he has the vision and financial
acumen to assemble businesses,'' Miller said of Martin. Martin
added, ``This is a deal I am really excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   But although both are powerful retail executives in their own
right, their backgrounds and manner could not be more dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 60, has been a retailer for his entire career. He began
at Filene's; he has been chairman of Marshall Field's and president
of Neiman Marcus and has held executive positions at Lord &AMP; Taylor
and Bloomingdale's. Martin, 46, fell into retail almost by accident
after serving in the Tennessee House of Representatives for 10
years and dabbling in real estate. In 1984, he bought Proffitt's,
noting that his wife liked to shop there. He took it public in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the epitome of a New York retailer, with custom
chalk-striped suits, burgundy suspenders and matching tie.
</P>
<P>
   His year-round tan suggests time spent at exotic outposts, and
his expensive wing-tipped shoes show that he cares about the sport
of shopping. His eyes light up when he talks about fashion; he
hobnobs with the likes of the designer Isaac Mizrahi, whom he
honored at a charity event he ran last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Martin looks like a high school vice principal. On Sunday he was
wearing a checked shirt, a casual floral tie and the sort of
nondescript plain black shoes that get replaced every two years
when their soles wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous friends are Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican and former governor, with whom Martin once ran a
business, and Bob Keeshan, known to the rest of the world as
Captain Kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   Martin turns a conversation about retail to the area of cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, shareholders of Saks Holdings would
be given 0.82 share of Proffitt's in exchange for each Saks share,
representing a transaction of about $2.1 billion, or a little less
than Saks' annual sales of $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Thursday's closing stock prices, each share of Saks
would be worth about $33.36; the stock closed last week at $29, up
$1.625. That 15 percent premium, however, is likely to change as
Wall Street reacts on Monday to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And shareholders may do better with shares in the new company.
Saks went public at $25 a share and has averaged about $23 this
year. By contrast, Proffitt's shares closed at $40.6875 Thursday, a
48 percent increase since the beginning of the year and far more in
line with Standard &AMP; Poor's retail index, which is up about 30
percent to date.
</P>
<P>
   Saks was represented in the deal by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Proffitt's was represented by Salomon Smith
Barney Inc.

ARMY FRUSTRATES EFFORT TO MARCH BY ORANGE ORDER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTADOWN, Northern Ireland _ Several thousand Protestants were
stymied Sunday in their efforts to march through a Catholic
neighborhood, leading to a standoff that could last indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Protestant members of the Orange Order, who insist it is their
right to march the route they have followed since 1807, have vowed
to stay here until they are allowed to walk down the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Separating them from their goal are more than 2,000 police
officers and British soldiers, a deep moat, a half-mile of barbed
wire, metal barriers, and a British government apparently
determined to prove that it will respect the concerns of Catholic
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   Catholics say the new political settlement guaranteeing equal
rights for them compels the British government to prevent the
Orangemen, so named for William of Orange, a 17th-century Dutch
king who ruled Britain with Queen Mary, from forcing their way
through the neighborhood. William is a hero to Ulster Protestants.
</P>
<P>
   Under the constant drone of British Army helicopters, the
standoff at Drumcree Church began almost anticlimactically, as a
few hundred Orangemen gathered in a field, surrounded by barbed
wire, and heavily-armed police and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   As dusk settled in this most bitterly divided town in Northern
Ireland, an eerie quiet suggested the intimidation and violence
promised here would manifest themselves elsewhere. Most of the
Orangemen went home, to collect provisions, many of them vowing to
return.
</P>
<P>
   By nightfall, there were no violent confrontations, but
loyalists torched cars and threw gasoline bombs in Sandy Row, a
loyalist enclave just outside Belfast city center, 35 miles
northwest of here. Some sources there suggested the unrest had more
to do with a dispute at a bar than the standoff at Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   The security measures taken by the British Army and the Royal
Ulster Constabulary left the Orangemen unsure of what to do. When
the midday service at Drumcree Chruch ended, the Orangemen walked
down the hill to an ugly steel barrier that prevented them from
proceeding up to the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike two years ago, when the police held the line for five
days before giving in, touching off the worst rioting in Northern
Ireland in years, there were no face-to-face confrontations between
police and the Orangemen. Instead, an Orange Order leader stood in
the shadow of the 20-foot-high barrier, cursing the barbed wire as
he read out a protest to the hundreds of reporters gathered at the
barrier before leading the parade back the other way.
</P>
<P>
   Again, unlike two years ago, when the fields surrounding
Drumcree Church were flooded with Orangemen wearing the sashes that
signify their loyalty to the British crown, there was only a token
presence of Orangemen throughout the day. Some suggested hundreds
or thousands of supporters would flock here over the next few days,
building pressure to let them march the rest of their traditional
route.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about their strategy, Orange leaders were coy. David
Burrows, a leader of the Portadown lodge, said Orangemen from
throughout Northern Ireland would fill the fields.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how long they were prepared to stay, David Jones, a local
Orange leader, said, ``As long as it takes.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Ingram, the British minister in charge of security, said it
was up to the police to decide whether the Orangemen are allowed to
stay there for as long as they want.
</P>
<P>
   On the nationalist side, Breandan Mac Cionnaith, leader of the
Garvaghy Road residents' group, said it was up to the British
government to prove its word by safeguarding the concerns of
nationalists.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Orange Order does not intend to listen to reason from any
quarter,'' said Mac Cionnaith.
</P>
<P>
   Orange Order officials estimated the marchers at 8,000. But a
count of those marching in the parade up to Drumcree Church by The
Boston Globe and The Irish Times placed the figure at about 2,500.
Police did not provide an estimate.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the count, it was considerably larger than the roughly
1,500 members of the Portadown lodge that organizes the annual
march. Orangemen say the march and church service is to commemorate
the thousands of Ulstermen, both Protestant and Catholic, who died
at the Battle of the Somme in 1916.
</P>
<P>
   But Catholic nationalists consider the parade provocative and
offensive and do not want it in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Garvaghy Road residents agreed to let the march proceed
with the understanding that there would be no triumphalist
displays, and with a promise from the local police commander that
any future parades would require the consent of residents. But
after the Ulster Unionist leader David Trimble and the Rev. Ian
Paisley, a fundamentalist preacher who leads the most
uncompromising of unionists, were photographed dancing gleefully
down the road and proclaiming a ``victory'' in getting the parade
through, Mac Cionnaith and the residents dug in their heels.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, after police relented against the loyalist threat and
beat nationalists off the road to let the parade pass, widespread
rioting flared throughout Northern Ireland. Last year, the police
chief, Ronnie Flanagan, decided that letting the parade through was
the ``lesser of two evils.'' Again, residents were beaten off the
road so the parade could pass. Again, rioting flared.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Parades Commission, created by the British
government to arbitrate the issue of contentious parades, ruled
that in the interest of stability throughout Northern Ireland the
march would be routed away from the Garvaghy Road.
</P>
<P>
   Orangemen, who pride themselves on being tough on law and order,
say they do not recognize the legitimacy of the Parades Commission.
</P>
<P>
   Up on the Corcrain Road, Gloria McLaughlin, 55, brought her two
grandchildren to see the Orangemen march up to Drumcree.
</P>
<P>
   ``They won't let them walk back the way they want, pet,'' she
explained to her 7-year-old granddaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Her 4-year-old grandson said he did not understand. ``It's
because of the terrorists, love,'' she told him.
</P>
<P>
   McLaughlin, who is Protestant, said she used to live in the
adjacent Catholic housing project, but had been forced out, and
considered the curtailing of the Orange parade the latest in a
series of humiliations Protestants had suffered in recent years.
She blamed the IRA and its political supporters in Sinn Fein for
isolating Protestant unionists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of my best friends are Catholics,'' McLaughlin said.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, people on and along the Garvaghy Road
relished a quiet first Sunday in July, their first in at least four
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wee bit of quiet will do us good,'' said Mary Murphy,
walking a half-dozen of her grandchildren back from the convenience
store.
</P>
<P>
   But Frankie Hamill saw little reason to be pleased, despite the
buffer zones between his community and Protestant unionists
fashioned by heavily armed police and soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Hamill stood outside St. John the Baptist church as passing
Orangemen stamped up and down on the pavement. It was, he said, an
insult to the memory of his cousin, Robert Hamill, who was stomped
to death by a loyalist mob last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the mindset,'' Hamill said. ``It hasn't changed. No
matter what year it is.''

   (NYT24) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- IMMIGRANT-WELCOME-2, 7-3 --
Julie Horvath-Krol, an actress from Hungary, says: don't wait in
lines Q make an appointment. If Independence Day celebrates America
Q fireworks, parades and cascades of red, white and blue Q then it
also celebrates what it means to be an American. And being an
American usually means being an immigrant or a descendant of
immigrants. (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT23) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- IMMIGRANT-WELCOME-1, 7-3 --
Dame Babou says immigrants need advice on where to learn English.
``I've observed people who ordered the same type of food for six
months, nine months, simply because they didn't know the word for
the other foods,'' says Babou, 45, who emigrated from Senegal 10
years ago and now works as a radio and newspaper correspondent in
Manhattan. (James Estrin/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT22) BOSTON -- July 3, 1998 -- JULY4-BOSTON-POPS, 7-3 --
David Mugar, a millionaire businessman who has sponsored Boston's
Fourth of July concerts since fireworks were added 25 years ago,
reviews preparations at the Hatch Shell, where the concert will be
held on Friday. ``I came up with the idea, just by luck, I guess
now, of having fireworks at the end of it,'' he says. (Ed Quinn/New
York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT21) CIUDAD JUAREZ, Mexico -- July 3, 1998 -- NAFTA-ENVIRON,
7-3 -- The ``black ditch'' in Ciudad Juarez, which serves as a
primitive method of sewage disposal for a city with a population of
1.2 million. Every day the Mexican city across the Rio Grande from
El Paso produces 75 million gallons of raw sewage, much of which
finds its way to the river, the prime source of water for nearly
every community in both Mexico and the United States between here
and the Gulf of Mexico. (Bruce Berman/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT20) TAMAQUA, Pa. -- July 3, 1998 --
MOLLY-MAGUIRES-MEMORIES-2, 7-3 -- Not long ago, the violent era of
the Molly Maguires was a taboo subject around Tamaqua. Now, it is
the stuff of a summer festival. Chilling scenes of the past are
re-enacted, like final blessings for the condemned. (Tim
Shaffer/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT19) TAMAQUA, Pa. -- July 3, 1998 --
MOLLY-MAGUIRES-MEMORIES-1, 7-3 -- Not long ago, the violent era of

the stuff of a summer festival. Chilling scenes of the past are
re-enacted, like this appointment with the gallows. (Tim

   (NYT18) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- NY-AMUSEMENT-PARK, 7-3 --
Megan Gentile aboard a helicopter ride Friday at South Beach
Amusement Park, which is for sale. The park is the heart of the
Staten Island summer, an acre of Americana almost in the shadow of
the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge. It is the final remnant of a
continuous string of amusement parks Q replete with Ferris wheels,
sideshows and tens of thousands of weekend visitors Q that once
rivaled Coney Island. (Edward Keating/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT17) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- SURVEILLANCE, 7-3 -- A
window display for the ``Police Pictures'' show at Grey Art
Gallery. Surveillance is out of hand. Walk into an apartment lobby
and you are on camera. Ride on an elevator and the guards in the
lobby watch you adjusting your pants. Get some money from a cash
machine and you'll be caught on film counting your bills. Busy
intersections are under 24-hour surveillance. There are cameras in
public squares. Don't bother destroying them. They'll only catch
you on tape doing it. (Barbara Alper/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT16) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- CHINA-PEONY, 7-3 -- Chen
Shi-Zheng, director of the magnificent production of the Chinese
opera ``The Peony Pavilion'' by the Shanghai Kunqu Opera Company
that was to have opened the Lincoln Center Festival next Tuesday
evening. But the project ran aground at the last minute on the
stony will of Ma Bomin, the director of the Shanghai Municipal
Bureau of Culture. ``This has been the longest two weeks of my
life,'' says Chen, 35. (Sara Krulwich/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT15) STAMFORD, Ct. -- July 3, 1998 -- CENDANT-FORBES, 7-3 --
Walter Forbes, Cendant's chairman, has kept a low profile since the
company reported the discovery of accounting irregularities in
April. But he says he still intends to take over as chief executive
in 2000. (Susan Farley/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT14) VALLEY FORGE, Pa. -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY
5 -- MUTFUND-VANGUARD, 7-3 -- Discount brokerage services ``are
never going to be a dominant part of what we are,'' says John
Brennan, chairman and chief executive of the Vanguard Group. ``My
job is to keep people focused on what it is that made us successful
in the first place,'' namely, ``a high value, client-first
philosophy.'' (Jonathan Levine/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT13) ANDERSON, Ind. -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5
-- EARN-MEDICAL-SAVINGS, 7-3 -- Julie Griswold of Anderson signed
up for a medical savings account to salt away tax-free money, but
the move didn't work out so well for her. ``If you are healthy or
if you make a lot of money, it's a great plan,'' says Ms. Griswold,
who earns about $26,000 a year and has had to postpone further
tests because of her medical bills. ``But if things start to go
wrong and you don't have a high income, it's not.'' (Tom

<P>
   (NYT12) PALM DESERT, Calif. -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN.,
JULY 5 -- SERIAL-MERGERS-2, 7-3 -- Richard Heckmann is the chief
executive of United States Filter Corp., which has completed more
than 150 acquisitions since 1991. Keeping track of all of the
company's activities is nearly impossible. And the sheer number of
purchases means that most investors do not know how quickly certain
businesses are growing and how profitable they are. (Davis
Barber/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT11) CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5
-- SERIAL-MERGERS-1, 7-3 -- Edward Crutchfield, the chairman of
First Union, which has made more than 70 acquisitions since 1985.
Crutchfield is telling analysts and investors that the bank will no
longer pursue deals in which it must pay a premium. (Nancy
Pierce/New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT10) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5 --
BANK-MERGERS, 7-3 -- At a public hearing in Manhattan last month,
community activists protest the pending Citicorp-Travelers Group
merger by chanting and raising red umbrellas Q Traveler's logo. As
part of their merger application, Citicorp and Travelers, which
will be known as Citigroup, have promised the Federal Reserve that
they will make $115 billion in loans to low-income and minority
communities over the next 10 years. (John Sotomayor/New York Times

   (NYT9) DENVER -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5 --
MUTFUND-QUARTER-3, 7-3 -- Scott Schoelzel found firm ground in a
spongy spring quarter. Big technology bets did the trick for his
Janus 20 portfolio, which, as its name implies, holds just 20
stocks. (Ellen Jaskol/New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT8) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5 --
MUTFUND-QUARTER-2, 7-3 -- Tracy Stouffer, of Federated
International Small Co., looked to Europe. ``We're not getting any
small-cap effect in emerging markets because all the companies are
becoming smaller and smaller, the result of shrinking prices and
currency erosion,'' she says. Her fund, which ended in third place
on the list of diversified international stock funds for the second
quarter, returned 10.5 percent. (Edward Keating/New York Times

</P>
<P>
   (NYT7) ATLANTA -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5 --
MUTFUND-QUARTER-1, 7-3 -- Michael Orkin of Caldwell &AMP; Orkin Market
Opportunity found firm ground in a spongy spring quarter. His fund,
based in Atlanta, landed the No.12 position on the list of
best-performing United States diversified funds in the second
quarter, with a 10.1 percent return. Much of that is attributable
to Orkin's short-selling, which involves betting on a decline,
rather than an increase, in the price of a stock. (Alan S.
Weiner/New York Times Photo) *LITE

<P>
   (NYT6) EDGEWATER, N.J. -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5
-- YEOHLEE-SHOP, 7-3 -- At Yaohan Plaza, the riverfront Japanese
mall in Edgewater, Yeohlee Teng, the Malaysian-born New York
designer, has a field day. Badtz Maru pops up everywhere here. His
pudgy cartoon features glower on miniaturized note pads and canvas
backpacks, and he puffs himself up importantly on a child's lunch
box, where he caught Yeohlee's eye. The mall is a mecca for
homesick Japanese. (David Corio/New York Times Photo) *LITE
</P>
<P>
   (NYT5) ROCKLIN, Calif. -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5
-- FUNDS-WATCH, 7-3 -- Jack Bowers, the editor of Fidelity Monitor
in Rocklin, has devised a system for selecting sector funds. ``If a
sector is cheap and performs well, it tends to continue to
outperform six months past the point at which it is no longer
considered a good value,'' he says. (Don Preisler/New York Times

<P>
   (NYT4) UNDATED -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5 --
ABOUT-CARS-CADILLAC, 7-3 -- The DeVille boasts ``X Files''
engineering, but the container is still all Lawrence Welk. It has
been 20 years since Cadillac had a record sales year. What has
happened to this American icon underscores a marketing adage: Great
brands don't die; they kill themselves. (New York Times Photo)
</P>
<P>
   (NYT3) UNDATED -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5 --
CAR-SMART-CORVETTE, 7-3 -- The new-generation Corvette convertible,
left, and removable-top model, are now on the market. A
million-plus Corvettes have been built in more than four decades,
more than any other single sports car ever. (New York Times Photo)

<P>
   (NYT2) HARTFORD, Conn. -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5
-- SPEND-CAR-LEASE, 7-3 -- Leigh Gold of West Hartford says she
thought she was buying a Volvo station wagon. But after her last
payment, she says, she was told that she had only been leasing it Q
and that she would have to pay an additional $1,000 to buy it
outright. (George Ruhe/New York Times Photo) *LITE

   (NYT1) NEW YORK -- July 3, 1998 -- ADV. FOR SUN., JULY 5 --
KARAOKE-NIGHTLIFE, 7-3 -- Performers at the Lansky Lounge on the
Lower East Side have included David Lee Roth. This truly odd moment
Q a rock star performing a karaoke version of his own recording Q
was part of a reawakened interest among New York hipsters in the
sing-along pastime imported from Japan. (Miles Ladin/New York Times

   (NYT12) NEW YORK -- July 5, 1998 -- NY-MALNOURISHED-CHILD, 7-5
-- Deanna Allston, 31, foster mother of a malnourished child, is
taken into custody. The boy, Dennis Davis, who will be 3 on Sept.
15 weighs only 18 pounds - less than half the normal weight of a
child of 2 years and 9 months - was in stable condition at the
Sisters of Charity Medical Center. He was being fed nutrients
intravenously and was expected to survive. Ms. Allston has been
charged with reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a
child. (William Lopez/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT11) MIMS, Fla. -- July 5, 1998 -- FLA-FIRES, 7-5 -- Like
dozens of families returning home after being evacuated because of
wildfires, the Callahans found their home in Mims, destroyed.
Setsuko Callahan combs the charred remains for signs of something
in particular. ``I lost my wedding ring,'' she says. In other parts
of Florida, people are hoping for rain, maybe even a tropical
storm, but any heavy rain - if it comes at all - is still days
away, forecasters say. (Terry Renna/New York Times Photo)

Yankees manager Joe Torre, left, congratulates first baseman Tino

Sunday. The win moves the Yankees record to 61-20 at the half-way
point in the season, which ties the Major League record for most

1907 Chicago Cubs. (Michelle V. Agins/New York Times Photo)

Miller, left, the chief executive officer of Saks, and Robert
Bradley Martin, the chief executive of Proffitt's, meet to discuss
Proffitt's $2.1 billion acquisition of Saks. The proposed deal
would represent the end of an era for Saks, whose founders Horace
Saks and Bernard Gimbel would likely never have imagined the store
as famous as the avenue on which it sits would one day be part of a
retail conglomerate based in Alcoa, Tenn. (Frances Roberts/New York

   (NYT8) CARMEL, Calif. -- July 5, 1998 -- CALIF-HORSEMEAT-VOTE-2,
7-5 -- In an upcoming referendum, Californians will be asked to
decide whether to make it illegal to participate in the sale or
purchase of a horse pegged for human ingestion. Barbara Clarke,
director of Redwings Horse Sanctuary, a center that rescues horses
from slaughter, also has six resident donkeys in her care that she
says might have become ``donkey jerky'' if they had not ended up
with her. (Peter DaSilva/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT7) CARMEL, Calif. -- July 5, 1998 -- CALIF-HORSEMEAT-VOTE-1,
7-5 -- Californians, who recently weighed in on the fates of
bilingual education and affirmative action, will be asked to decide
the destiny of horses: specifically, whether to make it illegal to
participate in the sale or purchase of a horse pegged for human
ingestion. These adult horses have been rescued from slaughter and
now run free to graze in a large pasture at the Redwings Horse
Sanctuary in Carmel. (Peter DaSilva/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT6) NEW YORK -- July 5, 1998 -- MEDIA-TALK, 7-5 -- To
challenge a cultural trade gap, the German government and a
division of the German Publishers and Booksellers Association have
established a German book office in New York to increase sales of
English-language rights for translated German books. Michael
Naumann, a former German publisher who now heads Henry Holt &AMP; Co.,
declined to join the group's board. ``I don't really see a profound
reason for their presence here,'' he says. (Don Hogan Charles/New

more than a year after the introduction of DVDs, manufacturers had
sold nearly 600,000 DVD players - that's faster than either compact
disk players or VCRs did at the corresponding points after they
were introduced. (Dan Krauss/New York Times Photo)

   (NYT4) SAN FRANCISCO -- July 5, 1998 -- E-MAIL-IGNORE, 7-5 --
Paul Raskin, left, heads a unit that oversees the flow of customer
e-mail at Charles Schwab in San Francisco. The discount brokerage
is actively trying to increase the percentage of customer queries
handled by e-mail rather than by phone. E-mail now accounts for
one-third of customer inquiries to the electronic brokerage
services unit, receiving up to 15,000 electronic messages a week.

-- Nanci Donnellan, the self-described 'Fabulous Sports Babe,' on
the air, left, and with her personalized bus. Knowledgeable and
often irreverent, she is the only female host of a nationally
syndicated sports talk show. About 250,000 sports fans each month
call the Babe's 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. daily call-in show, transmitted
live from New York to 187 stations. It is one of the few radio
programs to generate nearly $1 million in annual revenue. (Marilynn

   (NYT2) TUKWILA, Wash. -- July 5, 1998 -- KINKO-PEOPLE-2, 7-5 --
Kinko's outlets, like this one in Tukwila, offer business travelers
and customers with home offices a mix of fax machines, color
printers and networks of computers equipped with popular software
programs and high-speed Internet connections. As millions more
people join the work-at-home trend each year, Kinko's appears to be
doing what people envisioned cybercafes would do - offer an escape
from the isolation that this abundance of modern technology seems
to have created. (Dan Lamont/New York Times Photo)

The Kinko's outlet in Tukwila, outside Seattle is the largest of
the company's 902 stores worldwide, and the lettering on the door
sums up their business model: ``Your branch office/Open 24 hours.''
Many business people, while traveling, have come to regard Kinko's
as their office away from home, stopping in to check their e-mail
or otherwise make quick use of a computer. (Dan Lamont/New York

taken into custody. The boy, Dennis Davis, who will be 3 on Sept.
15 weighs only 18 pounds - less than half the normal weight of a
child of 2 years and 9 months - was in stable condition at the
Sisters of Charity Medical Center. He was being fed nutrients
intravenously and was expected to survive. Ms. Allston has been
charged with reckless endangerment and endangering the welfare of a
child. (William Lopez/New York Times Photo)

THE MARIS CHASE TOPS AN EXCITING FIRST HALF 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By MURRAY CHASS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The highlight of the All-Star Game festivities could be
the home run contest at Coors Field on Monday night, but it will be
the home run contest that resumes after Tuesday night's All-Star
Game that will command the attention of fans and baseball people
everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The pursuit of Roger Maris' 37-year-old record of 61 home runs
in a single season clearly dominated the first half of the season
and will intensify as the games and weeks go by and the season
approaches September, the 15th round of this heavyweight
championship fight.
</P>
<P>
   Mark McGwire. Ken Griffey Jr. Sammy Sosa. Take your pick, or sit
back and enjoy as these magical hitters chase Maris and each other.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing close,'' Tom Kelly, the Minnesota Twins'
manager, said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's terrific for the game,'' said Andy MacPhail, the
president of the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Not even the election of Bud Selig as commissioner on Thursday
can overshadow the significance of the home run chase for this
season, a development that can forever eradicate the lingering ill
feeling over the 1994-95 labor dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The first half of the season, on the other hand, was not
consumed completely by McGwire and friends. The Yankees' start _
``It's more than a start,'' Kelly said _ has been a mind-boggling
development in itself. Not only are the Yankees threatening to
shatter the Chicago Cubs' 92-year-old record of 116 victories, but
they have also rendered their owner silent. Who can complain about
a 61-20 record?
</P>
<P>
   The Boston Red Sox have also had an impressive first half, but
it's their typical luck that they should have this kind of season
when the Yankees have given new meaning to the musical title ``Damn
Yankees.'' Boston's current winning percentage would compute to 99
victories over an entire season, but that total would get the Red
Sox a wild-card spot at best.
</P>
<P>
   The same division, on the other hand, has produced the most
stunning development on the loss side of the ledger. It would have
been thought impossible for a team with a $69 million payroll, the
highest in the sport's history, to be 26{ games out at the All-Star
Game break, but that is precisely where the Baltimore Orioles find
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As surprisingly bad as the Seattle Mariners have been and as
mysteriously as the Colorado Rockies have lost their lust for
offense, their failures pale in comparison with the collapse of the
Orioles.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, no team has brewed an in-season transformation like
the Los Angeles Dodgers have.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Doing a frighteningly good imitation of the Yankees of other
years, the Dodgers fired their general manager and manager,
jettisoned their best hitter and their best rookie and resurrected
as interim general manager the former manager who insists he bleeds
Dodger blue. They still don't look, smell or feel like a contender.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Marlins weren't a contender from Day 1 of the
season, but they nevertheless continued to decimate their team in
the first half, leaving themselves with not even a skeleton of the
team that won the World Series last year.
</P>
<P>
   The season has produced some scintillating individual
performances besides the Maris matter. David Wells pitched a
perfect game for the Yankees. Kerry Wood, an awe-inspiring rookie,
struck out 20 for the Chicago Cubs at the age of 20, breaking the
National League record and tying the major-league mark. Greg Maddux
of Atlanta leaped halfway to his fifth Cy Young award with a 12-2
record and a 1.54 earned run average. Juan Gonzalez of Texas
entered his final game before the break with 97 runs batted in,
making him a genuine threat to Hack Wilson's 68-year-old record of
190. Rickey Henderson, 39, leads the majors in stolen bases with
37.
</P>
<P>
   The first half was notable, too, for the emergence of two more
members of the Cuban contingent. Rolando Arrojo has a 10-5 record
for Tampa Bay as a rookie, and Orlando Hernandez, technically a
rookie but pitching like some of the best veterans, has a 3-1
record and 2.08 ERA in six starts for the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   But the numbers that were most captivating and compelling
entering Sunday night were 37, 35 and 33, the home run totals,
respectively, of McGwire, Griffey and Sosa. In a late development,
there is also 30, which Greg Vaughn reached with a pair of home
runs Sunday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Griffey led the chase approaching mid-May, having hit 15 home
runs to McGwire's 13. McGwire snatched the lead when he slugged his
16th on May 16 and then created some distance between him and
Griffey with a three-homer flurry at Philadelphia on May 19.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was not a part of the competition for the first eight weeks
of the season, but he leaped in conspicuously by hitting 21 home
runs in 22 games from May 25 through June 21. Griffey, who had
slipped back, produced his own hot streak, hitting seven in nine
recent games.
</P>
<P>
   ``McGwire has always been a threat if he can stay healthy,''
MacPhail said. ``He might have broken the record prior to this year
if he could have played with the frequency he's played with this
year. I think he has to be the favorite if he can stay healthy.
That's the primary question _ not will he hit enough of them, but
will he play enough?''
</P>
<P>
   The home run derby clearly has aroused fans. Batting practice
has become a required part of any fan's attendance at a Cardinals
game. In Cincinnati last Friday night, the Reds' game with St.
Louis drew a crowd of 41,302, including 9,338 who bought their
tickets that day.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly, whose Twins recently entertained McGwire, said: ``I think
it's fun. When McGwire was here last week, there was a big crowd
for batting practice and a big crowd for the game, so obviously
people want to see him.''
</P>
<P>
   In Chicago, Sosa has become a matinee _ and an evening _ idol.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's remarkable, the chanting that goes on,'' MacPhail said.
``The electricity when he comes to the plate has been remarkable.
When he hit the ball across the street onto a porch, there was a
sign the next day saying, `Sammy was here.''' And this weekend, in
a takeoff on July 4 and the patriotic symbol of Uncle Sam, some
Cubs fans proclaimed it ``Uncle Sammy weekend.''
</P>
<P>
   As the challengers reached the All-Star Game break, though,
there was one note of caution. McGwire, Griffey and Sosa hit no
home runs Friday or Saturday, marking the first time since April
18-19 that none of them had hit a home run in two successive games
when they all had played. McGwire furthermore didn't hit any home
runs in his last five games, and Sosa sat out Sunday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it's a sign; maybe it's just a lull before the real home
run storm. Whatever it was, Kelly said he did not believe anything
had come close this season to competing with the Maris pursuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In New York you had the interleague play with the two teams,''
he said. ``That was good for the city, but it hasn't got rave
reviews anywhere else. I'm sure the Yankee record is some sort of
topic in New York, too, but they're not talking about it here.''
</P>
<P>
   Fans in many places, however, are finding baseball the thing to
do this summer. The Dodgers and the Giants drew 98,000 fans for
their first two games in San Francisco this weekend. In southern
California, the Oakland Athletics and the Angels played their first
two games before 83,000, while the Colorado Rockies and the Padres
attracted 102,000 for two games in San Diego, including the majors'
biggest crowd of the season on Saturday night, 61,148.
</P>
<P>
   McGwire, Griffey and Sosa didn't play in any of those games.

YANKEES TIE RECORD FOR MOST WINS IN 81 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to replace ``start'' with ``midseason marks'' in the lede
graf, and to cut several words from the 11th graf; no other
changes)  (mk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The last time a major league baseball team won 61 of
its first 81 games, Theodore Roosevelt was president of the United
States, Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt were newlyweds and a
precocius child named George Herman Ruth, later known as the Babe,
had just left his father's saloon in Baltimore for a school for
wayward boys. The last time until Sunday, that is, when the Yankees
defeated the Baltimore Orioles to make their record 61-20, equaling
the midseason marks of the 1907 Chicago Cubs and the 1902
Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees of 1927 are generally considered to be the greatest
team of all time, its lineup graced by the famed Murderers Row;
that group won 57 of its first 81 games. Whether the Yankees of
1998 will be compared favorably to the '27 Yankees, the 1961
Yankees, the 1976 Cincinnati Reds or any of baseball's other great
teams will depend on whether they win the World Series, and whether
they continue to win at such an astounding rate during the regular
season. They are on a pace to win 122 games, which would shatter
the existing 20th century records.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should be proud,'' said David Cone, who is one of three
Yankee pitchers with 10 or more victories. ``It's a great start.
It's a great accomplishment to be named with the best teams of
all-time.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager, has a lineup stocked with
stars, like right fielder Paul O'Neill, but also capable veteran
role players, like Darryl Strawberry, and a pitching staff that
includes the likes of Cone and David Wells, who pitched a perfect
game May 17.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the obvious talent, however, the Yankees seem to possess
a karma; good things happen for them. Orlando Hernandez, the
defector from Cuba who has been a wild success, was promoted to the
big leagues last month only because a Jack Russell terrier
belonging to David Cone's mother bit Cone on the hand, forcing him
to miss a start. On Sunday, the Yankees scored the only run of the
game when Chad Curtis was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have their own little Truman Show,'' said Scott Erickson,
the Baltimore pitcher, referring to the movie about a man who
doesn't know his life is scripted to perfection. ``Everything goes
right for the Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Branch Rickey, the legendary baseball executive, once said that
luck is the residue of design, and this Yankee team resulted from
the evolution of George Steinbrenner, the team's principal owner.
</P>
<P>
   For years, Steinbrenner invested heavily in free agents and
traded away his organization's top prospects, and through this
approach, the Yankees eventually were left with an aged team and a
barren farm system. But Steinbrenner placed more emphasis on
developing prospects, and his executives, in turn, concentrated on
scouting the personalities of prospective Yankees, as well as their
talents.
</P>
<P>
   The farm system regenerated and now the Yankees are built around
home-grown players, like shortstop Derek Jeter, center fielder
Bernie Williams and reliever Mariano Rivera.
</P>
<P>
   Already they had O'Neill and Tino Martinez, great hitters who
seethe with intensity. Before this season, they added Scott
Brosius, a very likeable and highly respected third baseman, who
Torre says maintains his focus from pitch to pitch as well as
anybody he has ever seen, and Chuck Knoblauch, a leadoff hitter who
engages opposing pitchers in a tireless tug-of-war almost every
time he bats. ``I've never seen a team that is as focused as this
one,'' said Steinbrenner, whose teams have won championships in
1977, 1978 and 1996.

<P>
   ``Sesame Street'' producers might consider using the Yankees as
an example of unselfishness. Joe Girardi, the regular catcher when
the Yankees won the World Series two years ago, tutors Jorge Posada
on a daily basis, even as Posada has assumed Girardi's playing
time. Tim Raines and Strawberry, superstars when they were younger,
are sometimes removed for pinch-hitters and must share playing
time. ``You're talking about real professionalism,'' Cone said
earlier this year. ``Those guys want to play as much as anybody,
but what is most important to them is winning. That's what
everybody is all about here, is winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Brosius: ``The core of the team is the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre said in spring training that to manage this group, he
needed merely to stay out of the way and let them play. He has been
more proactive than that, of course _ he reined in Wells in early
May, pushing him to be more consistent in his approach to
conditioning, and Wells has been nearly unbeatable since.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre has watched the talent, intensity and the
unselfishness translate into success nobody could have envisioned,
despite a myriad of injuries, distractions and odd circumstances.
After opening the season by losing their first three games and four
of their first five, Torre answered questions about whether
Steinbrenner might be inclined to change managers. The Yankees
proceeded to win 22 of their next 24 games, despite losing the
slugger Chili Davis to ankle surgery and their closer, Rivera, for
two weeks with a strained muscle.
</P>
<P>
   Two days after Wells pitched his perfect game, the Yankees
played the Orioles for the first time, and after Baltimore's
Armando Benitez hit Martinez with a pitch, the teams engaged in a
frightening brawl. As Torre decried Benitez's act, it was apparent
he was pleased how his players defended each other during the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' offense carried the team into early June, batting
.300 through the first 59 games and averaging more than 6.5 runs
per game. But just as Jeter and Williams suffered injuries, the
starting pitching, bolstered by the ascendence of Hernandez and the
improvement of Cone and Wells, became dominant. The Yankees'
starters have a 2.73 earned run average over the last 31 games,
with a 19-5 record.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern is always that the pitching is intact,'' said
Torre.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is expected to rejoin the Yankees later this week,
Davis sometime next month, and there is no sign of let-up from the
pitching. The Yankees already are beyond the hardest part of their
schedule, and 42 of their remaining 81 games are at Yankee Stadium,
where they have won 33 of 39 this season. They could approach 120
victories, an almost unimaginable achievement.
</P>
<P>
   But that would only fuel the pressure on the Yankees, as they
pursued their ultimate goal through the playoff land mines and the
World Series. Winning all these games is nice, Girardi said Sunday,
but they would be satisfied winning just one game: The last game
they play, in October.

METS LOSE ON CONTROVERSIAL CALL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ All the frustration of the first half of the season
boiled down to one hotly contested play at home plate Sunday for
the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   When Angel Hernandez called Michael Tucker safe in the bottom of
the 11th inning, it not only gave the Braves a 3-2 victory over the
Mets at Turner Field and a three-game sweep of the teams' first
series this season. It also left the Mets angry, bewildered and, as
General Manager Steve Phillips later said, with a feeling ``as
frustrating as it can possibly be'' going into the All-Star Game
break.
</P>
<P>
   A pair of game-deciding calls this weekend succinctly
illustrated the difference in the Mets' and Yankees' first-half
fortunes. One that was clearly wrong gave the Yankees a victory
Saturday; one that looked wrong Sunday meant another crushing
defeat for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who wants to look at the replay or anyone who saw it
live knows what happened,'' said a furious Bobby Valentine, the
Mets' manager, of the collision between Tucker and catcher Mike
Piazza. ``All I know is I've got more wounds on a catcher that was
already wounded up _ marks 5 inches deep on his leg _ and another
game that we lost. That's all I know. And it's a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   The play sent the Mets (44-39), who now trail the Braves by a
season-high 12{ games in the National League East, into the
three-day break having lost seven of their last nine games. And on
a hot, humid day here, they realized they had lost just when they
thought they had forced a 12th inning.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, the bases loaded and closer John Franco (0-2) in
his third inning of work, Walt Weiss lifted a liner into short left
field. Bernard Gilkey, who was playing in, made the catch and
positioned himself perfectly for the medium throw home.
</P>
<P>
   Gilkey's low, online bullet easily beat Tucker, who had tagged
at third, to the plate. But it short-hopped Piazza, who had caught
all 10-plus innings one day after sustaining a mild concussion when
he was hit in the back of the head by a Gerald Williams backswing.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza made a tremendous play to gather in Gilkey's throw, then
crouched for the imminent collision. Tucker's slide was high enough
to tear a gash inside Piazza's right thigh. And replays appeared to
show that Piazza's tag beat Tucker's foot to the bag. But
Hernandez, who was positioned behind Piazza and just to his left,
did not even hesitate as he called Tucker safe.
</P>
<P>
   That set off Franco, who was backing up the play, and Valentine
as Tucker and the rest of the Braves went into a wild celebration.
Piazza stayed crouched for a moment, head buried in his chest,
before raising the ball with his right hand, thinking that he had
to get ready for a 12th-inning at-bat. When he realized what
Hernandez had ruled, however, Piazza slammed the ball, and then his
catching helmet, into the turf behind home plate. Though he tried,
he could not get into the argument, so many Mets were already
there.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires tried to retreat under the stands through a gate
near the Mets' dugout. A screaming Franco did all he could to get
in the umpire's way, and appeared to bump Hernandez more than once.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the umpires said, it wasn't good enough for the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pathetic,'' Piazza said. ``We were trying to ask him,
and they just walked away. He didn't even ask for help.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza's complaint echoed that of Baltimore Orioles Manager Ray
Miller on Saturday, when Marty Foster did not ask other umpires for
help after calling an Orioles runner out at third base even though
the Yankees' Scott Brosius had dropped the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The umpires also did not allow the Mets to appeal Tucker's
tag-up at third base, something Valentine said he would have done.
Not that Valentine felt it should have come to that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a front-row view,'' he said. ``The throw beat him. He
fell into Mike's lap with a lousy, illegal slide. He cut him up,
never touched the plate, got tagged out, and they boarded the
plane. I saw what everyone else saw. No marks on home plate. A lot
of marks on Mike's leg where the cuts are.''
</P>
<P>
   Piazza said: ``That was the most ridiculous call I've ever seen
in my 10 years of pro baseball, in my 20 years of baseball, period.
It was just beyond belief. I'm completely flabbergasted.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez did not comment on his ruling after the game. But the
crew chief, Randy Marsh, told a pool reporter: ``He ruled the guy's
foot was in before Piazza had control of the ball to tag him. The
bottom line was that his foot hit the plate before he tagged him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tucker agreed. ``He tagged me on the knee,'' he said. ``If the
ball gets there and he tags you on the knee, where's the rest of
your foot?''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That was not how Piazza saw it. ``I was on the plate; he didn't
even reach it,'' he said. ``He hit the ground after he hit me. He
just jumped right into me.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the wild argument that ensued, Marsh said: ``I know there
was contact with Franco and Valentine. It was hard to get Franco to
stop, to be honest with you. He was not only on Angel, but he
pushed me away when I was trying to get him to get control of
himself.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said he never touched anyone. And Franco said: ``I
just gave him an earful. I was standing in his way. A lot of guys
made contact. At first, he said Mike dropped the ball. Then he said
the leg got in there. He didn't even know. It was a hot day, a real
tough game. To lose it like that, especially with the way we've
been struggling lately, is a tough one to swallow.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets _ except for Piazza and pitcher Rick Reed, their
All-Star representatives _ now have three days to think about the
rest of their season, and their coming rematch with the Braves in
New York. On Friday, the Mets lost here when Andruw Jones made a
spectacular throw from center to cut down the tying run at the
plate. On Saturday, they lost Piazza for most of the game to what
could have been a serious injury. And on Sunday, they lost amid a
boiling controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be good to get away,'' Valentine said. ``Maybe that's
bottom. We come in here and play our hearts out and have two games
decided at the plate. I'm proud of my guys. I think they'll come
back.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   MIMS, Fla. _ Ed Callahan, who served all over the world with the
Army Special Forces and has the tattoos to prove it, stood in front
of a pile of melted glass, scorched metal and blackened wood and
talked tough about the wildfire that leaped out of the Florida
palmettos and consumed his house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It don't bother me,'' he said of the once-immaculate,
middle-class house with a pool that he and his wife had filled with
memories and treasures from his postings in Asia and elsewhere.
Like dozens of others in central and northeast Florida last week,
he and his family left their house when the wildfire threatened,
and returned to find it in ashes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all insured,'' said Callahan, a retired master sergeant.
``We'll re-do it. Make it even better.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, his wife, Setsuko, squatted in the ruin of the
house. A small woman, she had a smudge of soot on her face as she
carefully poked and sifted through a powdery ash, digging up wine
glasses that had melted into misshapen lumps, uncovering shards of
china, then moving on, foot by foot.
</P>
<P>
   She was looking for something in particular.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost my wedding ring,'' she said, and kept on digging.
</P>
<P>
   Even as wildfires raged in counties in northeastern and central
Florida, firefighters, blessed with a few scattered rain showers,
less dry wind and a higher humidity over the weekend, began gaining
ground in fire-ravaged areas instead of just grimly holding it. As
the smoke cleared, those here returned to find the result of the
roaring, popping orange flames that had forced evacuations in
scenes that have haunted the state since May.
</P>
<P>
   In Mims, a small town in Brevard County near Florida's east
central coast, hundreds of people returned to their homes this
weekend. A dozen or so, like the Callahans on Golden Shores Drive,
lost everything they could not hurriedly stuff into their car.
Others, like Frank Kirkland in the Hog Valley neighborhood near
Interstate 95, came home to find some yards and outbuildings
burned, but found with relief that firefighters had killed the
blaze just as it touched their homes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't been standing right there,'' almost with their
backs to his mobile home, ``it wouldn't be here,'' said Kirkland,
who used to work at the Kennedy Space Center and now raises deer
dogs and pot-bellied pigs.
</P>
<P>
   And still others, like the Mayhew family just outside Mims,
defied evacuation orders and fought the wildfire themselves,
pumping water from a nearby pond and saving a cluster of mobile
homes, although, as 21-year-old Donnie Mayhew said, it almost
seemed as if the fire was determined to have them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd put it out in one place and it would come at us from
someplace else,'' Mayhew said. ``I've never seen fire like that.''
</P>
<P>
   No one has, at least here.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency said 1,946 fires have
burned 458,288 acres since June 1, causing an estimated $276
million in damage _ the worst disaster since Hurricane Andrew _ and
injuring 95 people, mostly firefighters.
</P>
<P>
   In the area around Mims and nearby Scottsmoor, about 15 miles
south of the Kennedy Space Center, at least 30 houses have been
destroyed, as about 60 fires continued to burn in the surrounding
county.
</P>
<P>
   To the north, in Flagler County, a mandatory evacuation of
30,000 people remained in effect, as people waited in shelters and
wondered what they would find back home.
</P>
<P>
   People here hope for rain, maybe even a tropical storm, but any
heavy rain _ if it comes at all _ is still days away, forecasters
say.
</P>
<P>
   In Mims, a part of Florida where orange groves, dense scrub and
green inlets provide scenery for U.S. Highway 1, retirees,
blue-collar workers and charter boat captains have watched for days
as the flames threatened five-bedroom dream homes and double-wide
trailers, which were dream houses, too, for some here. Black smut
streaked several roofs of the houses still standing, and vinyl
siding hung wrinkled and warped from others.
</P>
<P>
   Bedsheets, tied to fences and mailboxes, flapped softly in the
faint breeze. ``Thank You, Firefighters,'' they say.
</P>
<P>
   And here and there are big piles of ash, where the flames either
attacked houses before firefighters could get there, or, in the
case of a few, drove them away when they did. That is what happened
to the Callahan house, where it got so hot firefighters had to
throw down their hoses and run. They returned a while later, to
apologize. But they did not have to.
</P>
<P>
   Callahan, who served in Vietnam, said he did not want anyone to
get hurt trying to save things that could be replaced. He and his
wife and daughter, 21-year-old Naomi, were fine. So were their two
dogs, two cats and a bird.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're luckier than other people,'' said Callahan. Some
material things, of course, could not be replaced. ``All my
medals,'' he said. ``But hell, I know what I did.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The lesson in it, is not to get attached to material things,''
he said, his eyes hidden behind dark glasses.
</P>
<P>
   His wife called to him, a few minutes later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I found an angel,'' she said, holding up a glass figure that
had once sat on their mantel.
</P>
<P>
   As he plans the rebuilding, he sounds like the old sergeant,
reclaiming an overrun firebase.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to get us a used motor home, and we will establish
ourselves again on this property,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, they will start on a new dream house.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to go through something like this,'' said Callahan.
``It toughens you up.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hog Valley, a more rural road where acres of palmettos are
now blackened nubs, Donnie Mayhew sat in deep shade and described
the wildfire that left the landscape this way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fought it ourselves,'' he said, but he wasn't bragging.
``We were lucky.''
</P>
<P>
   It began, last week, as a glow in the distance. Then, quickly,
it was racing toward the cluster of mobile homes where Mayhew, his
father, Bill, and other family and friends live.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could hear it coming, crackling and roaring,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But this was no steadily marching line of flame. It burned
erratically as the wind shifted and swirled, and new fires sprang
up.
</P>
<P>
   His family had a pond, a pump and a generator to run it. The
generator saved them, after the fires burned down the power poles.
</P>
<P>
   They sprayed the houses and then focused on the fire line
itself, but every time it would seem like they had won, ``the wind
would shift, and it would come at us from the other end.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a lot of people here, everything they have is contained in
the aluminum walls of those mobile homes.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to stay until we couldn't stay no more,'' said
Mayhew.
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, Frank Kirkland dumped a bucketful of water
over the head of a pot-bellied pig named Little Bit. The fire had
reached up to the wire of the pen she shared with three babies,
and, apparently, just stopped. She snorted gratefully as the cool
water trickled over her ears.
</P>
<P>
   His emotions were mixed. The firefighters saved his mobile home
at the very last minute but the flames destroyed a building he
called ``my pavilion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a TV, five picnic tables, a jukebox,'' he said. He had
planned a big party for the Fourth of July, and had stored two
whole hogs in a refrigerator, planning to barbecue them.
</P>
<P>
   He opened the refrigerator and gazed down at the meat that had
sizzled inside the freezer as the flames roared around it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Didn't get good and done,'' he said, as the stench of rotting
meat filled the air.
</P>
<P>
   For others, there were no mixed blessings, only a feeling that
something terrible had passed them by.
</P>
<P>
   In the shade of a tree near U.S. 1, three firefighters from
Okeechobee _ part of the hundreds who have come here from around
the state and country _ rested between emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   A man they had never seen walked up and thanked them. ``You guys
saved my house, twice,'' said Chet Richards, shaking their hands.
</P>
<P>
   The firefighters, Steve Weeks, Jim Fusco and Herb Smith, said it
is something that happens a lot to the firefighters here.
</P>
<P>
   A woman drove up and asked them if they were hungry, and left
them with bags of food and a giant tub of chocolate chip cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't walk around the corner without somebody bringing you
food,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   It makes it worthwhile, the men said, when it seems like the
ground underneath is about to melt their feet.

SPORTS COLUMN: YANKEES' TORRE TAKES NOTHING FOR GRANTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the 61st time this season, the Yankees did Sunday
what they have done with regularity since April: They won.
</P>
<P>
   The 1-0 victory over Baltimore boosted the Yankees' record to
61-20. Now at the major-league All-Star Game break, the Yankees are
being touted as the best team in the history of the game. At this
point in the season.
</P>
<P>
   That little proviso hangs like a banner inside a Yankee locker
room filled with lofty talk of destiny _ mostly from outsiders.
This team, whose whole is not obscured by its individual parts, has
crushed opponents in every conceivable manner: the long ball, the
short ball, a finesse team roaring in like an angry bull in a china
closet. Brawling, playing it straight.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Yankees are 61-20 at the midway point, but now the
challenges intensify. Can the team sustain this pace? Will it let
down? How can the team stay focused?
</P>
<P>
   ``The record means a lot to me,'' Joe Torre, the manager, said
Sunday. ``That means you've had a dominant first half. But you need
to play two halves. So you have to be very cautious and not get
yourself too overconfident and thinking that you don't have to work
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   This is a veteran team, and there are enough terrifying frames
of reference to keep everyone on his toes. Some current team
members were on the roster in 1996 when the Yankees saw a
commanding lead shrink to nearly nothing. ``I'm here to remind
them,'' Torre said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said this team has been as disciplined as any team he
has been around in terms of focus and determination. ``Today is
another example of it,'' he said. ``On a day that the All-Star
break is coming, sometimes people tend to leave a day ahead of
time. But it didn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a deeper frame of reference for Torre on the folly of
arrogance before the deed is done. Torre was 14 when his beloved
New York Giants humbly crept into the 1954 World Series against the
murderous Cleveland Indians, who barreled into the Series with 111
victories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I remember vividly,'' Torre recalled, ``is
Cleveland going in to play the Giants thinking it was going to be
tough and then all of a sudden, boom boom boom. They beat them four
straight.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Girardi was not quite 5 in 1969, in Peoria, Ill., when his
Cubs, much like the Yankees though nothing nearly as dramatic,
bolted out of the blocks and led the National League by a
comfortable margin at the All-Star Game break. They leveled out in
August, then lost eight straight in September while the hot Mets
won 10 straight and wound up winning by eight games. ``That was a
killer,'' Girardi said.
</P>
<P>
   As the Orioles streamed out of the Stadium Sunday afternoon,
Elrod Hendricks, Baltimore's bullpen coach, stood next to the team
bus. Hendricks was in his second season with Baltimore in 1969 when
the Orioles were a slick-fielding, heavy-hitting team with the best
pitching staff in baseball: Jim Palmer, Mike Cuellar and Dave
McNally. The Mets beat them. In five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference between us and the Yankees is that we already
had reached the World Series,'' said Hendricks, who acknowledged
that the Yankees enjoyed the best first half in the history of
baseball _ ``but it is just one half.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are on a breathtaking pace toward posterity. The
players walk the line between living in the moment and looking
toward the next three months of the season. The Yankees are being
compared with the 1906 Chicago Cubs, who won 116 games but didn't
win the World Series. The Yankees' midpoint record is tied for the
best ever with the 1907 Cubs, who went on to sweep Detroit in the
World Series, and the 1902 Pittsburgh Pirates, who finished with a
record 27{-game lead before there was a World Series.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, of course, is that the Yankees are only halfway
through. ``Anything can happen.'' Hendricks said.
</P>
<P>
   Fatigue, injuries, breaks starting to go the other way. This is
all part of the suspense to come: The challenge is not whether the
Yankees will reach the World Series, or even whether they will keep
winning. Will they, can they keep winning at this breakneck pace?
Girardi said the team didn't care about posterity. ``We just want
to reach the World Series,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Cleveland keeps finding its way into this pretty
Yankees picture. The other day, Dwight Gooden, the former Yankee
and Met, won his second game of the season. Some recalled his
no-hitter at Yankee Stadium in 1996 as the culmination of a steep
comeback. Who says he won't have a similar rebirth this fall? Just
in time for the Yankees?
</P>
<P>
   Torre thinks about his Giants' great autumn of 1954 and how his
beloved team started winning at the right time. ``They got hot.
That's what scares you about postseason,'' he said. ``In spite of
what you're supposed to do, you still have to go out there and play
the game.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A day after a severely malnourished 2-year-old boy
was discovered in an apartment on Staten Island, the child's foster
mother was arrested Sunday as she returned home from a long holiday
weekend, and a horrendous picture began to emerge of the life of a
child who had apparently been isolated, neglected and starved.
</P>
<P>
   The boy, Dennis Davis, who will be 3 on Sept. 15 but weighs only
18 pounds (less than half the normal weight of a child his age),
was in stable condition at the Sisters of Charity Medical Center.
He was being fed intravenously and was expected to survive.
</P>
<P>
   The foster mother, Deanna Allston, 31, was charged with reckless
endangerment and endangering the welfare of a child. Police said
she had left Dennis, hidden in a back room, and four other foster
children with her 19-year-old brother on Thursday for what she said
was an overnight trip.
</P>
<P>
   As police and child welfare authorities began investigations,
officials had only sketchy information about the case, leaving
unanswered questions about Ms. Allston, the conditions under which
five children in her care were kept, and why caseworkers had not
detected the obvious problems of an emaciated boy.
</P>
<P>
   The caseworker for the Catholic Home Bureau, which placed Dennis
with Ms. Allston in his infancy under a contract with the city's
Administration for Children's Services, could not be reached
Sunday, and officials said records showed only that a caseworker
who was not the boy's regular monitor had seen him on June 15 and
had said he seemed thin. His last recorded weight _ the date was
unclear _ was 23 pounds, an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors and a sister described Ms. Allston as a secretive
woman who worked for the foster agency that had placed children in
her care, who took good care of four of the children, but
apparently turned Dennis into a kind of infant nonperson who was
hidden away most of the time in a dark, stifling room on a stained
mattress, fed just enough to survive and often left alone on
weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``She used to keep him in a carriage with the door closed,''
Chaniqua Allston, 23, said of her sister, recalling a visit. ``All
the other kids were around the house. I said, `Why is he in that
room?' She was like, `Don't go in there.'''
</P>
<P>
   Chaniqua Allston, whose 4-year-old daughter, Nataysia, was one
of the five children in Deanna Allston's custody, said she had not
seen Dennis for more than a year and had asked her sister last
December what had happened to the boy. ``She said, `Oh, I don't
have him no more.'''
</P>
<P>
   When her sister went out on weekends, Chaniqua Allston said, she
took four of the children, including Nataysia, to the home of a
baby sitter approved by the Catholic Home Bureau. But she never had
the baby sitter in her apartment, and she apparently left Dennis
home alone when she went out, Chaniqua said.
</P>
<P>
   There were no signs that the other children in her care were
mistreated, one official familiar with the case said. The natural
mother of three of them _ Michael Hayton, 5, and his brothers,
Sheron, 6, and Bruce, 1 _ saw them last Wednesday or Thursday, and
found nothing evidently wrong, the official said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The plight of the dehydrated, malnourished boy apparently came
to light only because Deanna Allston did not follow her usual
routine, her sister and welfare officials said. On Thursday, Deanna
Allston told the agency she was going away and that her usual
approved baby sitter would be in charge of the children.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, for reasons that were unexplained Sunday, she enlisted
her brother, Aaron, of Staten Island, as a baby sitter and left him
in charge of the children at her flat on the second floor of a
two-family house in a middle-class neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   According to Chaniqua Allston, Aaron was unaware that Dennis was
still in his sister's custody, and had no idea the child was in a
back room. She said Deanna had told Aaron she would visit an
amusement park in Pennsylvania with a friend, and would be back on
Friday. But Friday passed and she did not return. She had still not
returned by Saturday afternoon, Chaniqua said, when Dennis _ to
Aaron's amazement _ crawled out of the back room.
</P>
<P>
   The child was skeletal.
</P>
<P>
   Chaniqua Allston said her brother called her and said: ``I don't
want to stay here. I'm scared. It feels like somebody died in
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Chaniqua Allston, who also lives on Staten Island, went
immediately to her sister's apartment. She was stunned at Dennis'
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``His legs were like sticks,'' she said. ``His skin color had
changed. The blood, like the dark blood color, was showing through
his skin. He looked like he was about to die. I was scared.''
</P>
<P>
   He had been kept in a dark, airless back room with plastic over
the windows, she said. A mattress stained with urine and vomit was
on the floor. She tried to talk to the boy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Dennis. Dennis.' He was not responding to me, and he
couldn't walk. He couldn't cry. He didn't make a sound. He was
awake, but he was just sitting there. He was just looking around,
rocking his head back and forth.''
</P>
<P>
   She called 911. The police arrived shortly afterward and took
the five children to the hospital. Dennis and Michael Hayton were
admitted and the others were treated and released to child welfare
authorities, who said they would be placed in new foster homes.
</P>
<P>
   Michael was suffering from sickle cell anemia and appeared to be
slightly undernourished, but he was in stable condition and was
even ``up and around,'' talking to hospital workers, officials
said. But Dennis was severely dehydrated and malnourished. He
immediately consumed seven bottles of formula, they said, and was
being given nutritional supplements intravenously.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been to hell and back, that's for sure,'' said
hospital spokesman William McCann.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Saks Fifth Avenue, one of the most venerable names in
retail, said Sunday that it would be acquired for $2.1 billion by
Proffitt's Inc., a Southern retailing company that is all but
unknown to New York shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed deal would represent the end of an era for Saks,
whose founders, Horace Saks and Bernard Gimbel, probably never
imagined that the famous store on natty Fifth Avenue would one day
be part of a retail conglomerate based in Alcoa, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Since Saks was founded in 1924, it has undergone several changes
of ownership, managing to escape the fate of many famous New York
stores. It avoided extinction, unlike B. Altman and Gimbel's, and
it was not swallowed up by a giant retail company, as was Macy's
when it was acquired by Federated Department Stores.
</P>
<P>
   For shoppers on Fifth Avenue looking for the latest Gucci shoe,
the change of ownership will not be noticeable, but those living in
the Midwest, where some of Saks' less profitable stores are, may
see a different name above the door. And some of Proffitt's stores
may change their name to Saks. In fact, Proffitt's will rename
itself Saks Inc., seeking some of the glamour of the famous name.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is just one Saks Fifth Avenue, and the power of the
brand is exactly where retail is going,'' said Robert Bradley
Martin, Proffitt's chief executive, who will be the chairman and
chief executive of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The merger serves as a near-exit strategy for the largest
shareholder of Saks Holdings Inc., the Bahrain-based investment
company Investcorp International, which bought the retailer for
$1.6 billion in 1990 and had been hoping in recent years to make a
killing the way it did with other luxury investments like Tiffany &AMP;
Co. and Gucci Group.
</P>
<P>
   Although the bank initially sold 20 percent of Saks to the
public in 1995 for $425 million and followed up with another stock
offering, it now finds itself and its clients not cashing out as
they had hoped, but rather holding 12 percent of Proffitt's.
</P>
<P>
   Still, based on Thursday's closing stock prices, Investcorp and
other shareholders in Saks now own stock worth about 15 percent
more than last week, assuming shareholders of both companies
approve the deal.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, Proffitts does not seem to be the best match for
Saks. Proffitt's runs 234 stores that serve middle-income shoppers
in the South and Midwest with names like Proffitt's, Younkers,
Carson Pirie Scott, and Herbergers. Most of the stores resemble
Macy's in terms of what they sell _ lots of Tommy Hilfiger, Liz
Claiborne, Nine West and Estee Lauder.
</P>
<P>
   Saks has the opposite strategy at its 96 stores nationwide. Many
of the brands that Proffitt's specializes in were evicted from Saks
two years ago in an effort to give the retailer a tonier image. Its
staples are Gucci, Oscar de la Renta and Yves St. Laurent, all
names not carried even in Proffitt's most upscale store, Parisian.
</P>
<P>
   ``In terms of merchandise synergies, there are none,'' Martin
admitted. ``But we'll buy telecommunications, transportation, paper
supplies and other things at an enormous cost savings. This deal is
not built on merchandise synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Proffitt's, which was founded in 1919 with a handful of stores
in Knoxville, Tenn., has built its fortunes on the success of
acquisitions. In the last three years, it has acquired a dizzying
seven names, including Carson Pirie Scott in the Midwest, and has
slowly built up a portfolio, creating $3.5 billion in revenue. As a
result of the acquisitions, sales and profit margins have risen
smartly as expenses have become lower.
</P>
<P>
   While the company was attracted to operational cost savings with
the Saks acquisition, it is also eager to tap into the Saks fashion
savvy that has been lacking at Proffitt's.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will form a product-development unit that will
build up private-label programs for all the divisions. Saks already
has a strong variety of private-label brands, and Proffitt's has
said that it wants 12 percent of its merchandise to be private
label.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the two stores now have access to each other's geographic
regions. Expanding on both coasts, for example, ``would be a good
supplement to what Proffitt's does in the Midwest,'' said Isaac
Lagnado, a retail consultant in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Other plans for the new company include greater international
use of the Saks name, an increase in the number of domestic stores,
and an expanded use of the database of Saks credit-card holders and
catalog shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   After the merger, the new Saks Inc. will have its headquarters
in Birmingham, Ala., where Proffitt's Inc. recently moved. Saks
Fifth Avenue, meanwhile, will be run _ more or less independently
from the company's other divisions _ by its current management team
out of New York.

</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Philip B. Miller, the chief executive of Saks, Brian
Kendrick, the retailer's chief operating officer, and Martin sat in
Miller's opulent office across the street from the company's
flagship store, talking of how enthusiastic they were about the
deal. ``Brad has demonstrated that he has the vision and financial
acumen to assemble businesses,'' Miller said of Martin. Martin
added, ``This is a deal I am really excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   But although both are powerful retail executives in their own
right, their backgrounds and manner could not be more dissimilar.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, 60, has been a retailer for his entire career. He began
at Filene's; he has been chairman of Marshall Field's and president
of Neiman Marcus and has held executive positions at Lord &AMP; Taylor
and Bloomingdale's. Martin, 46, fell into retail almost by accident
after serving in the Tennessee House of Representatives for 10
years and dabbling in real estate. In 1984, he bought Proffitt's,
noting that his wife liked to shop there. He took it public in
1987.
</P>
<P>
   Miller is the epitome of a New York retailer, with custom
chalk-striped suits, burgundy suspenders and matching tie.
</P>
<P>
   His year-round tan suggests time spent at exotic outposts, and
his expensive wing-tipped shoes show that he cares about the sport
of shopping. His eyes light up when he talks about fashion; he
hobnobs with the likes of the designer Isaac Mizrahi, whom he
honored at a charity event he ran last winter.
</P>
<P>
   Martin looks like a high school vice principal. On Sunday he was
wearing a checked shirt, a casual floral tie and the sort of
nondescript plain black shoes that get replaced every two years
when their soles wear thin.
</P>
<P>
   His most famous friends are Lamar Alexander, the Tennessee
Republican and former governor, with whom Martin once ran a
business, and Bob Keeshan, known to the rest of the world as
Captain Kangaroo.
</P>
<P>
   Martin turns a conversation about retail to the area of cost
savings.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the deal, shareholders of Saks Holdings would
be given 0.82 share of Proffitt's in exchange for each Saks share,
representing a transaction of about $2.1 billion, or a little less
than Saks' annual sales of $2.3 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Thursday's closing stock prices, each share of Saks
would be worth about $33.36; the stock closed last week at $29, up
$1.625. That 15 percent premium, however, is likely to change as
Wall Street reacts on Monday to the deal.
</P>
<P>
   And shareholders may do better with shares in the new company.
Saks went public at $25 a share and has averaged about $23 this
year. By contrast, Proffitt's shares closed at $40.6875 Thursday, a
48 percent increase since the beginning of the year and far more in
line with Standard &AMP; Poor's retail index, which is up about 30
percent to date.
</P>
<P>
   Saks was represented in the deal by Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. and
Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. Proffitt's was represented by Salomon Smith
Barney Inc.

REPORTERS SAY PERU OFFICIALS DIRECT HARASSMENT EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ A leading reporter here, Angel Paez, is no stranger
to trouble. He has received anonymous telephoned death threats for
years. Marxist terrorists have tried to kill him two times. He has
been accused at different points of being a communist and a CIA
spy.
</P>
<P>
   But just when he thought he had seen it all, four newspapers
began subjecting him three months ago to a daily barrage of
articles that questioned his character and patriotism in a campaign
that appears to have been orchestrated by government security
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Day after day, the newspapers, which typically specialize in
soft pornography and blood-curdling crime reports, have been
characterizing Paez, 34, a reporter with La Republica, as a liar
and merchant of state secrets who is on the Ecuadorean military
payroll. The articles about him, and to a lesser extent nine other
newspaper and television journalists who have investigated
government corruption and human rights abuses, include intimate
details of their personal lives, political pasts and finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``If everything they said about me was true, I'd be a
millionaire,'' Paez said in an interview at his desk, which was
heaped with files of documents, a copy of excerpts from the
Pentagon Papers, class graduation lists for the Peruvian military
academy and several works by Agatha Christie. ``In truth, I don't
have a car, not even a personal computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Peruvian journalists have long been subject to arrest, bombings,
wiretaps and other overt forms of censorship. But this new
campaign, ostensibly by competing news organs, has galvanized the
local news media to hold unusual unity protests. The daily articles
have also inspired a solidarity campaign by international press
groups and even drawn the Clinton administration into the fray in
support of the reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This campaign in the yellow press against specific
investigative journalists creates a climate of intolerance,'' said
the U.S ambassador, Dennis Jett, who recently made a highly
publicized visit to the office of La Republica to lend Paez and his
editors moral support. ``It's being orchestrated by someone.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the four newspapers have separate editorial staffs,
many of the articles about the journalists have identical headlines
and texts. The paper that is giving the most prominence to the
articles, El Tio, began publishing this year, shortly before the
campaign began. All the papers have small circulations and cost a
few pennies, and what little advertising they attract comes mostly
from government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   President Alberto Fujimori has promised an investigation,
acknowledging that government officials might be involved but
saying that it is without his authorization. Several Peruvian
journalists say that they take Fujimori at his word and that the
antipress campaign illuminates fissures between him and senior
military and intelligence officials.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign began after articles by Paez about arms
trafficking, bribery and government purchases of armaments that
proved to be shoddy and overpriced.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those interested in obtaining commissions _ bribes _ are
interested in stopping these stories,'' the owner and publisher of
La Republica, Gustavo Mohme Llona, said. ``We are going to continue
publishing the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Mohme, who has been called a communist and ``prophet of the
devil'' in the other papers, said he had considered suing for
libel, ``but we know the court system is controlled by the
government, and we would certainly lose.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   An article on May 25 in El Tio headlined ``The Traitor Paez
Sends Secret Army Documents Abroad'' said, ``The traitor Angel Paez
maintains a permanent disinformation campaign against the armed
forces.'' An article on May 15 in the paper called Paez a
``Judas,'' saying he tried to revive the sinking fortunes of the
Shining Path and Tupac Amaru guerrilla groups.
</P>
<P>
   Paez and other Peruvian journalists say that the newspapers have
little credibility but that their articles nevertheless had
chilling effects. Paez said he feared a common criminal or mentally
ill person could take the articles as a green light to attack him
as traitor. He is beginning, he said, to take security measures
that he learned from studying the tactics of the Shining Path,
including sleeping in different homes on different nights and
traveling to and from work by different routes every day.
</P>
<P>
   Paez is investigating who is behind the campaign and says he has
enlisted an informer in the newsroom of El Tio who sent Paez a copy
of an article that was faxed to El Tio the day before it was
published word for word in the tabloid. At the top of the faxed
article was the name and fax number of a public relations firm
owned by a consultant who has long worked for the Peruvian army
high command, Augusto Bresani.
</P>
<P>
   Bresani has denied any involvement in the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very clear this is a sophisticated campaign, and there's
strong evidence it's government orchestrated,'' Joel Simon, the
Americas program director at the Committee to Protect Journalists,
said here after a meeting with Fujimori. But he said the problem
was particularly hard to combat because his and similar groups were
wary about attacking any news organs.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last week Fujimori said: ``Angel Paez continues
to investigate, and I invite him to continue doing so. Nobody stops
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the two owners of El Tio said they were out of the
country. Cesar Augusto Davila, director of the newspaper El Chino,
another one that is attacking the journalists, refused to discuss
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether government officials were behind the articles,
Davila answered: ``I can't talk to you about this. Have a nice
trip.''

LITTLE PEOPLE KICK OFF CONVENTION WITH CALIFORNIA BEACH PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE CONDON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Southern California plays host to so many kinds
of beach parties _ volleyball beach parties, sand castle-building
beach parties, barbecue beach parties _ that they usually don't
draw much attention.
</P>
<P>
   But the bash held Sunday on Topanga State Beach was just a bit
different.
</P>
<P>
   It was a dwarf beach party. More than 100 self-described
``little people'' took over the beach from the surfer dudes for a
day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like a family reunion,'' Donna Ryan, a Columbus,
Ohio, resident attending the party, said while other partygoers
threw Frisbees and played in the sand nearby. ``Around here you are
not different.''
</P>
<P>
   The celebration was one of many events being held this week as
part of the Little People of America's 1998 National Conference.
About 1,500 people from around the world at or under 4 feet, 10
inches in height, and their families, descended on the Warner
Center Marriott hotel in the San Fernando Valley.
</P>
<P>
   The conference features a variety of sports events, held at
California State University, Northridge, as well as more than 40
discussion groups and workshops on topics of concern to
participants. The subjects include developmental milestones,
managed care and disabilities in the '90s, parenting, driving
issues, adoption, orthopedic concerns, neurological problems, and
women's sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   There are also seminars about mixed couples, where one person is
short-statured and a spouse is average height. The conference also
includes a dating game event and a fashion show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just about letting little people know there are other
little people out there,'' said Roy Rudd, a 46-year-old Wal-Mart
management executive in from Bentonville, Ark., to attend the
conference. ``We're just a little bit shorter than everybody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Little People of America was founded in 1957 by 3-foot-9-inch
actor Billy Barty as a way for short-statured people to get
together. Today, the organization hosts the annual conference and
provides information on medical, social and discrimination issues
for little people, including youths.
</P>
<P>
   Conference participant Jeff Patterson, a 29-year-old resident of
Tuscon, Ariz., spent Sunday afternoon at the beach bodysurfing with
two friends. He's spending most of his time participating in the
sports events, such as volleyball, power lifting, softball,
basketball, and track and field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It helps a lot athletically to be able to compete with people
my own size,'' Patterson said.
</P>
<P>
   A business account executive with AirTouch Cellular, Patterson
said he was ``flabbergasted'' when he attended his first Little
People of America Conference nine years ago _ the first time he was
ever around so many people like himself. His only regret is that he
didn't start going to the conferences when he was younger.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd said that growing up in rural Arkansas, he didn't meet
another little person until he was in high school. He joined Little
People of America eight years ago when his son, Daniel, was born.
Rudd said it's important to him that Daniel and his 6-year-old
daughter, both of whom are also dwarfs, grow up knowing other
children who are shorter than everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   Ryan said her most difficult struggle has been against job
discrimination. She's a special education teacher, but she had
trouble getting a job because, at 4-foot-5, no one thought she
could keep order in the classroom. But once she was hired, she
proved them wrong, using a big voice to make up for her small
stature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very mouthy,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The best part of the conference, Rudd said, is that once a year
he gets to talk to everyone ``eye-to-eye.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Average people see each other eye-to-eye every day. We're more
at eye-to-butt level,'' he joked.

 &HT;    NAACP aids black farmers
 &HT;    By Peter Scott
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The plight of the nation's black farmers and black
land loss will be featured at the national convention of the NAACP
meeting in Atlanta this week.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of the nation's estimated 18,000 black farmers are
expected for the NAACP convention that begins Saturday, which will
include a ``walk for support'' demonstration in downtown Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are on the verge of extinction and if we lose all of our
land we have lost our heritage,'' said John Boyd, president of the
National Black Farmers Association, founded in 1995. He said he and
other farmers will be seeking the support of the NAACP and other
national civil rights groups in their fight to stem the tide of
loan denials and foreclosures among black farmers.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd will be one of the participants in a panel discussion, ``A
Journey, a Challenge, a Commitment in Support of America's Black
Farmers,'' scheduled for 9 a.m. July 15 at the Georgia World
Congress Center. Other scheduled panelists are Gary Grant,
president of the Black Farmers and Agriculturists Association,
founded in 1997; Ralph Paige of the Federation of Southern
Cooperatives; and a representative of Secretary of Agriculture Dan
Glickman's office.
</P>
<P>
   Glickman acknowledges that current and past administrations have
discriminated against black farmers by denying them loans based on
the color of their skin. About 600 black farmers in Georgia and 14
other states believe the secretary's forthright statements will
help them prevail in the $2.5 billion discrimination suit they have
pending in the U.S. District Court in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed an
agricultural appropriations bill, backed by House Speaker Newt
Gingrich, which was amended to waive the two-year statute of
limitations barring the filing of discrimination complaints.
Attorneys for the Justice Department said the number of black
farmers complaining about discrimination had to be limited based on
the two-year requirement in the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The
waiver opens the door for any black farmers to lodge complaints
with the federal courts including the U.S. Federal Court of Claims,
and the secretary of agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want the public to know that we are talking about the
demise of a large segment of our society,'' Grant said. ``Most of
the black farmers who are part of the pending lawsuit are either on
the verge of being put out of farming or they have been put out.''

Giants' 1st Half 
Ends With Flourish  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO After the Giants lost the last two games of their
interleague series against the A's, manager Dusty Baker gave his
team a manDate.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``We asked to win the last three series before the All-Star
break against Texas, Anaheim and the Dodgers,'' Baker said. ``Two
out of three, two out of three and two out of three.''
</P>
<P>
   Done, done and done.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point we had 46 victories. We wanted to go into the
break with 52. We did, and that's a good first half,'' Baker said.
``Hopefully we'll be in a position to have a good second half.''
</P>
<P>
   Baker had plenty of reason for optimism as he left for a fishing
trip to Montana. The Giants finalized his mandate Sunday by beating
the Dodgers 3-0 in front of 40,111 at 3Com Park, with Shawn Estes
evening his record to 7-7 on the strength of 62/3 shutout innings.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the Giants finished the first half 51-36 and led the
National League West by six games. This year they went 52-37 but
trail the first-place San Diego Padres by 5 1/2. When asked which
of his two teams was better, Baker said this year's.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give us Jeff Kent the last three weeks, are you going
to tell me we wouldn't have been markedly better?'' Baker said.
``Jeff was hot when he got hurt. If the Chicago Bulls lose Scottie
Pippen, you can't tell me the Bulls aren't going to be a worse
team. They would be a worse team with Michael (Jordan) and without
Scottie. It's the same on this team with Jeff and Barry (Bonds).''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the Giants have been worse without Kent. They were 41-24
when he sprained his right knee against Seattle on June 9 and 11-13
since. But in taking six of their last eight games the Giants
proved to themselves that they could win without him, even against
good teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last week, week and a half we accepted the fact that he's
not around,'' said catcher Brent Mayne, who went 3-for-3 with an
RBI Sunday. ``We had that big winning streak, and then we lost
Jeff, and then we lost all those games to San Diego. That was a big
downer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took us a long time to realize we're not going to have Jeff
in the four hole, and the last week, week and a half we came
together,'' Mayne said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's win was important for the team, but even more so for
Estes. Improving to .500 was an important psychological barrier for
the left-hander after a disappointing first half. Had he lost, he
would have been the only Giants starter to end it with a losing
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I can pretty much go into the second half like it's a new
season and put the first half behind me,'' Estes said. ``My goal in
the second half is to finish strong. Who's to say I can't have a
second half this year like the first half I had last year?''
</P>
<P>
   Estes will get a quick chance to start on that 12-2 run he's
looking for when he starts the Giants' next game Friday night in
Denver.
</P>
<P>
   Estes scattered eight hits in his 6 2/3 innings, getting into
trouble as he often has this year but making great pitches to
escape. Those pitches eluded him when he was torched for four-run
innings in each of his last two starts.
</P>
<P>
   His best Houdini job came in the sixth inning, with the Giants
leading 2-0. Raul Mondesi hit a leadoff single, and with one out
Estes walked Eric Karros and Bobby Bonilla to load the bases. He
had Bonilla 0-2. But Estes settled down and got Charles Johnson to
ground his first pitch to third. Charlie Hayes stepped on the bag
and threw to first for the inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Barry Bonds rewarded Estes by leading off the bottom of the
sixth with a triple and scoring the Giants' third run on J.T.
Snow's sacrifice fly. Baker said Bonds played an ``exhilarating
game'' after managing two hits in his previous 28 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants scored their first two runs off Dodgers starter
Darren Dreifort in the fifth inning on a walk to Snow, a Hayes
single through the left side of the infield, Mayne's RBI hit under
Karros' glove at first and a Rey Sanchez double-play ball that
brought Hayes home.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Reed relieved Estes in the seventh and quieted another
Dodger outburst by getting Mondesi to ground out. He also pitched a
strong eighth, and Robb Nen struck out two of four batters in the
ninth to earn his 25th save, tying him for the major-league lead
with Anaheim's Troy Percival and San Diego's Trevor Hoffman. &QL;

`ARMAGEDDON' HOLIDAY WEEKEND EARNIGNS LESS THAN EARTH-SHATTERING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- The monster asteroid failed to deliver
mega-grosses as ``Armageddon'' fell short of expectations with an
estimated $34 million at 3,127 theaters nationwide during the
Friday-Sunday period and $52.5 million in its first five days,
studio sources said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The initial numbers for the $140 million Disney project came in
well under the past two major Fourth of July holiday openings _
$84.1 million for the first five days of ``Men In Black'' last year
and $85 million for ``Independence Day'' in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't a disaster for Disney, but it's certainly a
disappointment,'' said analyst Arthur Rockwell of Drake Capital
Securities. ``It's not an auspicious beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon,'' starring Bruce Willis as the leader of a band of
oil drillers trying to nuke an asteroid headed for Earth, had been
so heavily hyped that no other films opened against it. But
Paramount's move to roll out a similar movie, ``Deep Impact,''
eight weeks ago clearly cut into ``Armageddon's'' audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep Impact,'' with a comet menacing the planet, opened with
$41.1 million and has grossed $137 million domestically. ``It's
tough having two meteor movies playing at almost the same time,''
Rockwell said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon,'' launched with a $60 million marketing push, also
suffered from an inability to draw significant numbers of families
and children, according to Robert Bucksbaum, president of the Reel
Source tracking service. ``It's only attracting young males and a
little bit of the date crowd,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Armageddon'' opened with $9.7 million Wednesday, followed by
$8.8 million Thursday, $13.6 million Friday, $11.1 million Saturday
and an estimated $9.3 million Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Several other factors hampered ``Armageddon,'' including mostly
negative reviews; its 2-hour, 20-minute length, viewed as excessive
for an action movie; the fact that the Fourth of July fell on a
Saturday, usually the heaviest day for moviegoing; and audiences
losing the appetite for films focused on the possible end of the
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone has seen everything blown up in these big
special-effects films,'' Bucksbaum said. ``You can't top it
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Bucksbaum said ``Armageddon'' will be lucky to wind up grossing
$140 million domestically, although the film should perform well
overseas due to Willis' strong appeal in foreign territories.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell said the key for ``Armageddon'' will be how well it
performs during the coming weekend, when it faces openings from
Warner Bros.' ``Lethal Weapon 4'' and DreamWorks' ``Small
Soldiers.'' He also said the less-than-stellar numbers for
``Armageddon'' doesn't mean studios will stop funding big-budget
projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studios still have to go for home runs, especially during
these key periods, but the picture has to deliver,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The second weekend of 20th Century Fox's ``Dr. Dolittle''
finished a respectable second, with $17.6 million at 2,869 theaters
from Friday to Sunday, giving the Eddie Murphy comedy $62.7 million
after 10 days and a decent shot at the $100 million mark by the end
of summer.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's third weekend of ``Mulan,'' with Murphy as the voice of
a wisecracking dragon, came in third with $10.7 million at 2,953
theaters to push its 17-day take past $76 million. The studio's
36th animated movie should finish above the $100 million grossed by
its ``Hercules'' last summer.
</P>
<P>
   Universal's second weekend of ``Out of Sight'' followed with
$6.3 million at 2,110 sites as the George Clooney comedy-romance
dropped 47 percent from its opening despite strong critical
support. Fox's third weekend of ``The X-Files'' suffered an even
sharper falloff in fifth with $6 million at 2,605 theaters, losing
55 percent of its audience from the previous weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's fifth weekend of ``The Truman Show'' came in sixth
with $5.7 million at 2,756 locations, giving the comedy-fantasy
$109.5 million in 31 days. The Jim Carrey project is now the 122nd
highest domestic grosser in Hollywood history, trailing ``Star Trek
IV's'' $109.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   Disney's fourth weekend of ``Six Days, Seven Nights'' finished
seventh with $4.9 million at 2,479 theaters to go past $55 million
in 17 days, topping Warner's fifth weekend of ``A Perfect Murder,''
with $3.3 million at 2,070 locations for $61 million overall.
</P>
<P>
   Rounding out the top 10 were Fox's sixth weekend of ``Hope
Floats,'' with $1.5 million at 1,264 sites, and Disney's eighth
weekend of ``The Horse Whisperer,'' with $1.2 million at 1,048
theaters.
</P>
<P>
   New Line's second weekend of its revamped ``Gone With the Wind''
continued to perform respectably with $820,000 at 214 theaters. The
cinema classic now has $194.7 million overall and is at 25th place
on the all-time domestic list. ``Deep Impact'' took in $745,000 at
1,116 screens to give it 71st place on the list after ``Platoon''
at $138 million.
</P>
<P>
   Paramount's 29th weekend of ``Titanic'' grossed $575,000 at 618
sites and has now taken in $588.2 million after 192 days.
``Titanic'' leads ``Star Wars'' as best domestic grosser by $127
million.

<P>
   So now baseball's OK again. Cool, even. It's not too
old-fashioned or too slow or too boring. The people who play it
aren't the horrible ingrates they used to be, and now everyone is
rushing to christen baseball's renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   The idea that baseball matters again started with Mark McGwire
and took off from there. It went through Kerry Wood and the New
York Yankees, picked up with Sammy Sosa and grabbed ahold of Juan
Gonzalez. It figures to stay alive with Greg Maddux and Ivan
Rodriguez, and with any luck a decent pennant race will break out
in your neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Baseball is on such a high that it's hard to conceive that the
people running the game could manage to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   And this isn't mere conjecture. There's proof that baseball is
in a hermetically sealed dreamworld, and it comes in the human form
of Albert Belle. He's the worst guy ever, right? The symbol of
everything that made baseball a bloated, self-important relic. He's
one of the reasons people who never paid much attention to baseball
swore it off anyway, just because it sounded good.
</P>
<P>
   But the other day Belle was asked if he wanted to be traded away
from the Chicago White Sox. The amazing thing isn't that Belle
answered the question _ although that ranks high _ but what he
said: ``I told Jerry Manuel I'm going down with the ship, that I
made a choice to play with the White Sox when I signed a contract
and I'm going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Of all the wonderful events of the first half of the season _
McGwire's homers, Wood's 20 strikeouts, Sosa's Byzantine post-homer
celebration _ those few words prove more than anything.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle, saying something the fans would want to hear.
Albert Belle, espousing loyalty and persistence. Albert Belle,
ambassador to the game.
</P>
<P>
   In a strange way, maybe baseball's resurgence is best measured
by calculating the bad things that haven't happened instead of the
good things that have.
</P>
<P>
   While basketball players fight over the right to smoke dope,
baseball has been showcasing great players who seem to be decent
people. It's hard to find fault with the public personas of Tony
Gwynn or Maddux, Ivan or Alex Rodriguez, Andres Galarraga or Curt
Schilling.
</P>
<P>
   The good deeds performed by Pedro and Ramon Martinez in their
Dominican hometown are more impressive than a thousand United Way
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   It's probably just a stroke of blind luck for baseball, but a
deep and solid group of individual players seems to have arrived on
the scene just as people began looking for dynamic individuals to
carry the sport.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't done through marketing or slogan-writers, that's for
sure. Nike hasn't had anything to do with it. It's as close to a
grassroots movement that is possible in a day of electronic
immediacy.
</P>
<P>
   (There's even something charming, in a strictly negative
postmodern sense, about watching big-salaried teams such as the
Orioles and Dodgers dive-bombing their way through the standings.
Just an added bonus to boost the enjoyment of the game.)
</P>
<P>
   Here's a bold statement that can be neither proved nor refuted:
If you created one lineup from Tuesday's All-Star Game, it would be
able to stand up against an All-Star lineup from any other decade.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, let's go another step: The only decade that could
legitimately compete with the players of the '90s would be the
'60s. Everyone else would have to sit in the back seat _ if they
were allowed in the car at all.
</P>
<P>
   Could you imagine thinking along those lines as recently as two
years ago? For the most part, the same players were doing many of
the same things, but the game was mired in the scorched earth of
post-strike. Baseball was an anachronism, too slow and too boring.
Baseball was typified by the grumbling visage of Bobby Cox,
scratching his head and complaining about another strike call.
Baseball was your father and grandfather sitting on the back porch
with a crackly old radio and a bottle of Homemade Hell, telling a
hundred stories about the 1960 Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   So maybe the pertinent question is this: Are these truly the
glory days, or is everyone just now willing to acknowledge it?
</P>
<P>
   Not that long ago, you'd tell someone you were interested in a
baseball game and they'd look at you as if you were going to sit
outside a grammar school with a bag of candy. Now you're considered
hopelessly inept if the Cardinals are in the bottom of the fifth
and you don't know whether McGwire has homered yet.
</P>
<P>
   Someday we'll be talking about Pedro Martinez, McGwire and Sosa,
Gwynn and Maddux. And the sad truth is, we'll have a hundred boring
stories about the '95 Braves.

 &HT;    Fires wreaking havoc with Florida animal population
 &HT;    By John Holland
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ A mother turkey leads her three chicks
through a scorched forrest so hot the birds can barely hobble
forward, Baby deer roam busy streets, apparently lost or orphaned
by the 10-week old blaze. Diamonback rattlesnakes pop up in
nieghborhoods and parking lots.
</P>
<P>
   The raging fires that forced more than 50,000 Central Florida
residents from their homes have left thousands of wild animals dead
or homeless, wildlife experts said.
</P>
<P>
   During the next few days, many more injured birds, racoons,
snakes and skunks are expected to hobble out of the woods in need
of help. ``They are like people who are discombulated by a
traumatic event,'' said Sabrina Keen, a wildlife biologist from
Oregon working for the Bureau of Land Management. ``They are very
stressed and very scared, just like we'd be, so you have to take
that into account and be careful and compassionate.''
</P>
<P>
   Local animal shelters are already picking up injured racoons,
birds and baby deer wandering into yards, and expect many more
phone calls soon. In general, they are telling people to take care
of the animals until the shelter employees arrive.
</P>
<P>
   There are exceptions, however.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday, a firefighter was bitten badly by a river otter who
got trapped in the blaze. When the firefighter tried to pick the
small animal up and take it to water, the scared otter lashed out,
biting through a leather glove and drawing blood.
</P>
<P>
   Snakes, many of them poisonous, are also creating problems.
Firefighters and National Guardsman battling the fire and digging
ditches have been slowed by rattlesnakes and other varieties.
Saturday, a firefighter killed a 4-foot rattlesnake, then bit it
before a live television audience.
</P>
<P>
   Rattlesnakes, dead and alive, are turning up in most
neighborhoods, and one was killed at the main emergency command
post in Ormond Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are no reported bites, officials are very
worried. They also strongly warn residents returning home not to
explore their burned-out backyards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those animals are very confused and they aren't happy campers
right now,'' said Ormond Beach Fire Chief Barry Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Several veterans and licensed wildlife handlers are helping out.
Workers at the Wildlife Refuge near Orlando are caring for a fawn
whose four paws were burned, and will take the animal to their vet
this morning.
</P>
<P>
   In Volusia County, Mary Keller has been doctoring wild birds for
30 years. She's already picked up a wild eagle and received several
calls Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very upsetting because these birds are very frightened
and hurt,'' Keller said. ``In all of these things, everyone forgets
about the little creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been some benefits to the fire. Deer and birds are
ingesting ashes, a great source of pottassium, while the brush
needed for ground nests should grow back quickly. Keen, the
wildlife biologist, said four-legged animals like deer and racoons
probably escaped the flames, while slow-moving tortoises ground
dwelling animals faced longer odds.
</P>
<P>
   A local man with a videocamera filmed a mother turkey and three
younger ones desparately trying to escape the flames in Volusia
County on Thursday, and turkey and tortoise sightings have become
common in the county.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very sad situation, but the reality is that a lot of
animals are going to die because of this fire,'' Keen said.

observed that German was a slippery language, ``elusive to the
grasp,'' and German literature was ``easy enough to read when you
hold them before the looking glass or stand on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   More than a century later, German writers are still struggling
to overcome such ingrained attitudes to attract the attention of
U.S. publishers, who relentlessly export popular American titles to
Germany and stock the best-seller lists with their translations. To
challenge this yawning cultural trade gap, the German government
and the international division of the German Publishers and
Booksellers Association have established a German book office in
New York with the primary purpose of increasing sales of
English-language rights for translated German books.
</P>
<P>
   So far the task has not been particularly easy, even though two
large German media conglomerates, Bertelsmann AG and Verlagsgruppe
Georg von Holtzbrinck, own several top trade publishing houses in
the United States. The nonprofit organization unsuccessfully
approached top executives from both corporations to join its board,
said Kathie von Ankum, the new director of the German Book Office
at the Goethe-Institut on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've seen a reluctance of German publishers to associate with
the German Book Office because they might feel it's a millstone
around their neck,'' Ms. von Ankum said.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Naumann, a former German publisher who now heads Von
Holtzbrinck's Henry Holt &AMP; Co., declined to join the group's board,
although he said he considered its work a valiant effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really see a profound reason for their presence
here,'' he said. ``If there is any chance to sell German books to
the American market, it will be the books of those publishers who
come here twice a year. And beyond that, these publishers have
agents, and I don't think they want to be represented by a
semiofficial office.''
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Leaders Dismiss American Indian Editor
</P>
<P>
   For friends of the printed word, the good news is that American
Indian media continue to grow on the more than 500 reservations
nationwide, financed in part by gambling revenues and land
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news for American Indian journalists is that First
Amendment guarantees rarely apply on the reservation.
</P>
<P>
   From the Hopi and Navajo Nations in the Southwest to the
Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma and the Oneida Nation in Wisconsin,
editors who try to present a balanced picture of their communities
and tribal governments often find themselves at odds with their
publishers. And in nearly all cases, the publishers are the tribal
governments.
</P>
<P>
   The latest case comes from the Lummi Nation, a tribe of 5,000
living 90 miles north of Seattle. Tribal officials closed a
newspaper, Squol Quol, last month, a week after the newspaper's
editor, Fredrick Lane, was dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Henry Cagey, the Lummi tribal chairman, said the reason was that
the newspaper and its editor were not meeting the community's
needs. ``The message we were getting from the community is that
they were not fully informed,'' Cagey said.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was dismissed for printing a letter by Marlene Dawson, a
county councilwoman, to Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., that said
federally financed Lummi schools were ``incubators of racism.''
</P>
<P>
   Cagey said the tribal business council told Lane not to run the
letter because the tribe was trying to build a good relationship
with the county and federal governments. The tribe's main source of
revenue is a $28 million federal grant.
</P>
<P>
   The quick hook is to be expected when government owns the means
of production, said Mark Anthony Rolo, editor of The Circle, an
independent American Indian magazine based in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reservations are basically one big family,'' Rolo said.
``These jobs are handed out by relatives with the promise of
publishing within certain parameters: Not to publish negative
things about the tribe.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishing Industry Has Surge in Book Reviews
</P>
<P>
   Sales of trade books are finally on the rise, and book reviews
are booming. A flurry of start-ups has recently emerged, and
several existing reviews have added issues. Some newspapers have
expanded their coverage of the publishing industry, while others
have added new review sections. Even TV stations are devoting more
time to books.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many books, and people are desperate for
filtering devices,'' said Jeffrey Kittay, editor in chief of the
new Lingua Franca Book Review, a semiannual offshoot of Lingua
Franca magazine that courts the same academic readership.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 68,175 new titles were published last year, compared
with 62,039 in 1996, according to the U.S. Copyright Office. As a
result, ``publishers are desperate to have their products
advertised and circulated,'' said A.O. Scott, a senior editor of
Lingua Franca magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Riding a boom in books for and about blacks, the Black Issues
Book Review will release the first of six issues for the year next
January. Foreword, a monthly magazine that covers independent
publishers and includes reviews, was started in June. Such
publications, which focus on a niche, have a better chance to
succeed than more general magazines, said Nora Rawlinson, editor in
chief of Publishers Weekly. But, she said, ``I don't see the
advertising dollars growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Some publications are turning to the Internet for exposure that
does not rely on advertising. Publishers Weekly has begun a daily
e-mail news service called PW Daily that summarizes reviews from
the mainstream media. Reviews from trade publications like Kirkus
and Booklist routinely appear on the site of Amazon.com, the
Internet bookseller. And The Boston Book Review's Electronic
Gazette sends reviews to 5,000 subscribers every month.
</P>
<P>
   Editors at existing reviews that have added issues think a
demand for more coverage of quirky, literate books is fueling this
expansion. Such reviews include the Voice Literary Supplement
(which went to six issues from four and to national distribution),
Book Forum (to four issues from two) and the New York Press' Books
and Publishing supplement (to monthly from quarterly).
</P>
<P>
   On the broadcast front, starting in September, C-Span will
dedicate 48 hours every weekend to books on ``Book TV.''

Big High Five for Sampras  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WIMBLEDON, England _ There were pleasant memories of Bjorn Borg
in the Centre Court stands Sunday, particularly up in the Royal
Box, where so many tennis greats had arrived to witness history.
There was a bit of Ivan Lendl in the air, too. Seldom has
Wimbledon's postmatch ceremony brought such feelings of doom.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, and for all time, there was Pete Sampras, a 6-7
(7-2), 7-6 (11-9), 6-4, 3-6, 6-3 winner over Goran Ivanisevic and a
five-time Wimbledon champion. That ties him with Borg for the
modern-day record, and with 11 Grand Slam titles, Sampras is just
one short of Roy Emerson's record.
</P>
<P>
   But for an agonizing few minutes, on the fringe of pomp and
circumstance, there was a devastated and inconsolable Ivanisevic.
``I can only kill myself,'' he said later, not altogether jokingly.
``This is the worst moment of my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Generally the ceremony is a festive affair, with dukes and
duchesses and tut-tuts and tally-hos. It's hard to feel terrible on
such an important stage; even Jana Novotna cheered up in '93 after
she had had a good cry. The typical photo shows a beaming victor
and a gracious loser, fashioning a wooden grin.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic was not smiling. He was holding a thin silver plate,
somewhat paltry-looking against the golden winner's trophy, and he
looked like he wanted to Frisbee that thing into the
strawberries-and-cream concession.
</P>
<P>
   Like Lendl, who spent his career in a futile Wimbledon
obsession, Ivanisevic can't win to save his life here. This was his
third final _ the only three he's reached among the Grand Slams _
and his third defeat. It was also the most disappointing, by far.
</P>
<P>
   These are heady times in Croatian sports _ their World Cup team
is through to the semifinals against France _ and when Ivanisevic
glanced toward the Royal Box Sunday, he saw both the prime minister
and ambassador of his country, right along with their wives.
</P>
<P>
   Not only that, this was Ivanisevic's best chance. Blown away by
Sampras in '94, powerless against Andre Agassi's emotional wave in
'92, Ivanisevic was the better player through much of Sunday's
match. He won the first set and had two set points in the second.
To lose _ it was just too much for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, this one hurts the most,'' he said. ``I cannot describe
it. You know, I've had some bad moments, when you are sick or when
somebody dies, but for me this is the worst thing ever.''
</P>
<P>
   If it's any consolation to Ivanisevic _ and of course, it won't
be _ this was the best tennis of Wimbledon '98. There were no great
matches (for the first time in memory) but this had the ebb and
flow of high intrigue.
</P>
<P>
   True, it was another grim display of the men's power game, and
for long stretches, you wanted to put some tiny wooden rackets in
their hands and enjoy the show. ``Can't they do  &LR; anything  &LR; to fix
this?'' cried a London-based American journalist, destitute in his
quest for rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Well, they did something. They invented the tiebreaker.
Otherwise, it's 78-77 in the first set and dawn is upon us. But you
could hardly blame the players. They are merely taking advantage of
today's Big Bertha-style equipment. When at war, you do not use
tanks when nuclear warheads are at your disposal.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic dominated the first tiebreaker, breaking through
Sampras' serve with a couple of tremendous passing shots, and on
each of those nerve-racking occasions in the second-set tiebreaker
_ set point for Ivanisevic on both _ Sampras faced a second serve.
But like every other shot in the book, that's one of his strengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pete's second serve is phenomenal,'' said John McEnroe.
``Maybe the best ever.'' And he got through that set, closing it
out with a first-service winner to Ivanisevic's backhand.
</P>
<P>
   The whole scene was a glimpse of the game's great history:
McEnroe in the broadcast booth; Pancho Segura and Stan Smith in the
stands; Boris Becker, Neale Fraser, Ashley Cooper and Don Budge in
the Royal Box. They are the ones who truly appreciate the
difficulty of Wimbledon and Sampras' ascent to the heights. What
they did not expect, perhaps, was the first five-set match Sampras
has ever played in a Grand Slam final.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is sort of amazing, when you think about it,'' said
Sampras. ``It felt different, too. I felt like there wasn't much
separating myself and Goran today. He was just playing huge.''
</P>
<P>
   He was also playing tired. That is not a good excuse for anyone
at Wimbledon, but Ivanisevic had played an interminable semifinal
against Richard Krajicek (15-13 in the fifth) on Friday, ``and that
cost me today,'' he said. ``My legs were not there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't sense that one bit,'' retorted Sampras. ``I thought
his serve was still coming in real big. I guess he's played a lot
of tennis the last few days, but in the fifth set at Wimbledon, you
have to suck it up.''
</P>
<P>
   The task was just too great _ for anyone who ever played Sampras
in a Wimbledon final. Borg won five straight (1976-80) to Sampras'
five out of six, but Pete is 5-for-5 on the final Sunday. As he
said later, ``Wimbledon is our Super Bowl. To me, it's what the
game's all about. You get that feeling of history, more than
anywhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   The fifth set ended abruptly, Sampras breaking Ivanisevic's
serve at love. There were sensational returns, a double-fault
(Goran's 20th) and finally an Ivanisevic volley into the net. The
clock showed 17.00 exactly _ the stroke of 5 p.m. A time for
history. And time for Ivanisevic to slump in a chair, cover his
head with a towel and tune out the world.
</P>
<P>
   All around him, the scene was vintage Wimbledon. The Duke and
Duchess of Kent made their customary entrance between two rows of
ballboys, occasionally stopping to chat. One imagined it going this
way:
</P>
<P>
   Duchess: ``Splendid, then.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy: ``Captivating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shame about Beckham.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tragic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Carry on, then.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, then.''
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, Ivanisevic slowly went mad. The towel never
left his head. Finally there were awards to present, and it took
the kindly hand of Alan Mills, the tournament chairman, to snap
Goran out of his misery.
</P>
<P>
   He went through the motions, tossing back his head to clear the
stringy, damp hair out of his face. Sampras broke into a canter,
parading around the perimeter in a victory lap, and Ivanisevic
sagged back in the chair _ a veritable electric chair in his mind _
to await further sentencing.
</P>
<P>
   ``They asked me to do one lap with the plate,'' Ivanisevic said
later. ``I just couldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the ill-fated Lendl, Ivanisevic will fade from the memory,
just another athlete who could not quite get it done. For Sampras
and his followers, there are questions of gravity: Is he a player
for the ages? Is he the greatest of all time?
</P>
<P>
   Well, he did not have McEnroe and Jimmy Connors to contend with,
like Borg, but there are infinitely more dangerous players in
today's game. Emerson won half of his 12 Grand Slams at the
Australian, managing just two each in the other three majors.
</P>
<P>
   But Sampras has never won the French. Emerson, strangely, is
seldom mentioned among the Lavers, Tildens, Borgs and Kramers.
Sampras is, with a formidable 11-2 record in Grand Slam finals.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of this is too much for me to talk about right now,'' said
Sampras. ``It's hard to believe that I've actually won five. It's a
little overwhelming to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite so overwhelming, however, as it is to the mere mortals
of tennis.

ZAPATA IN DEALS TO BUY 21 INTERNET PROPERTIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LISA NAPOLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It has been two months since Avram Glazer announced in
advertisements in national newspapers that he wanted to buy World
Wide Web sites. On Monday, Glazer and his Zapata Corp. will
disclose the results of his search: letters of intent to buy 21
properties and aggregate them under one site, www.Zap.com.
</P>
<P>
   The sites range from the search engine, Starting Point, to a
chat network, Chat Planet, to a variety of electronic commerce
offerings, including Bibliofind, Mass Music and Virtual Technology,
which sells computer equipment. Terms are not being disclosed, but
Glazer described them as ``substantial.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the second step of Glazer's plan to make Zapata ``No. 1
or No. 2 on the Internet.'' The first step, taken in April, was
acquiring the online magazines Word and Charged.
</P>
<P>
   Those acquisitions were part of an announced new strategy for
the company, which was founded as an oil business in 1953 by a
young George Bush and more recently had concentrated on processing
protein extracted from fish and other sea life.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Glazer also made a play to purchase the Web search
service Excite, but was rebuffed.
</P>
<P>
   Glazer contends that the user traffic generated by the combined
sites he is acquiring would make Zap, ``among the top 10 largest
Internet sites in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   But Media Metrix, a Web measurement company, said Glazer's
numbers were not realistic. An analysis of the traffic of 15 of the
sites found that of all Web users, 2.1 percent, or just over
900,000 people, visited the sites in May.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Glazer said that once he grouped all the sites
together under the Zap.com domain, the audience for each site would
grow ``exponentially.''
</P>
<P>
   He compared his strategy to the so-called portals that companies
like Excite, Yahoo and Infoseek operate _ doorway services through
which users pass on their way to other Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're kind of a portal plus, though we're different than the
other portal sites,'' he said. ``We plan a network of sites, which
the other portals don't have. It's a cross between a portal and
America Online.''

Mitchell Ends A's Half With a Bang  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ This Kevin Mitchell comeback and this scrappy 1998
Oakland A's team are showing themselves to be a lot more than the
lovable jokes they've seemed to some people.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell finally homered for the A's, sending a ball just over
the right-center field fence at Edison Field Sunday to tie the game
4-4 in the eighth. Then Mitchell came up in the ninth with the
bases loaded and fought off several 95-mph pitches from Angels
closer Troy Percival before drawing a walk to force home the
game-winning run in the A's 5-4 victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just realized the bases were loaded,'' Mitchell said. ``All
I could do was sit there and look for heaters. The first ball he
threw, I didn't even see it. It was like he humped up a little and
threw even harder.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the home run, which ended a career-high homerless streak
of 122 at-bats, Mitchell said: ``I'm getting old, man. I'm no young
stud anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The A's (41-45) swept the first-place Angels in three games to
pull within four games of .500 at the All-Star break, and they
pulled off the sweep even after Anaheim manager Terry Collins gave
his team a kick in the pants by saying they did not show enough
energy the first two games of this series.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great way to finish the half,'' manager Art Howe said
after calling a quick postgame meeting to congratulate the team on
its better-than-expected first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told us, `Good job, good first half,''' Mitchell said. ``He
said, `It puts us into the thick of things. Let's keep playing.'''
</P>
<P>
   The A's won five of six to wrap up the first half. That means
that as much as that other team in the Bay Area gobbles up the
lion's share of attention, the A's are only 21/2 games farther
behind the Angels in the American League West than the Giants are
behind the first-place Padres in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   That does not make the low-payroll A's anyone's pick to win
anything this year, except maybe a prize for Best Showing by a Team
the Year After Losing a Ruthian Slugger, but they are lucky enough
to be in a division without a dominating team. The Angels are a
good team, but they have looked wobbly lately; it's not just that
they have lost five straight, it's  &LR; how  &LR; they have lost five
straight.
</P>
<P>
   People in baseball watch ``SportsCenter'' as compulsively as
White House staffers read the New York Times. So just last Tuesday,
the Angels saw Mike Fetters use the old
fake-to-third-throw-to-first move to pick off hapless Padres
pinch-runner Ruben Rivera to end that day's game. Even so, Fetters
got out of a first-and-third, one-out jam in the seventh Sunday by
picking off pinch-runner Damon Mashore using the very same move.
Some in the Angels dugout felt Fetters balked, but that wasn't the
way the umpires saw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``We told (Mashore) about Fetters' third-and-first move,''
Collins said. ``(But) that was not the ballgame, believe me.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe not, but once Fetters struck out Cecil Fielder to end the
seventh with the Angels failing to pad their 4-3 lead, the A's had
a little extra hop in their steps. Mitchell was the next man to
bat, and he reached out to crank an outside breaking ball from
starter Chuck Finley. Once his homer tied it, the A's were free and
easy, and the Angels were bogged down by thoughts of oh-not-again.
</P>
<P>
   Even when Mike Blowers bobbled Darin Erstad's grounder in the
ninth to give the Angels a leadoff baserunner, Billy Taylor took
care of business for his 18th save. Just the day earlier, Blowers
had helped Taylor with his defense, and the A's veteran closer made
sure to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `I'll pick you up right here,''' Taylor said.
``This sweep is very big for us. I think that gives us a lot of
momentum going into the second half.''

COMMENTARY: SAMPLING THE KINDNESS OF STRANGERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rush hour is not a great time to be trying to get
from Times Square to Columbus Circle on the Nos. 1 or 9 trains. Not
in July. Not if you're pregnant. And certainly not if you are
expecting twins.
</P>
<P>
   But that was the point. Would the spectacle of what looks like _
and indeed is _ considerable discomfort in a fellow traveler
provoke from subway riders a show of sympathy? How long would it
take for pity to kick in and a seat to be offered up?
</P>
<P>
   In the interest of science, this columnist set out to
investigate in a more or less systematic fashion. Over a two-day
period, she and her beach ball-shaped belly made 20 rush-hour trips
on some of the busiest lines in the city, the Lexington Avenue and
the Broadway IRT. She picked out only the most crowded subway cars
and discounted any trips where even a single open seat was
available.
</P>
<P>
   What she discovered through her discomfort was oddly comforting.
</P>
<P>
   The farthest she had to travel before being offered a seat was
two stops on a local train. On 55 percent of her trips, she
received an offer almost immediately. For 25 percent of the time,
it took only one stop.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, empathy, or at least courtesy, appeared to be
universal, cutting across racial, sexual, ethnic and, to the extent
that it is possible to determine such things on the subway, class
distinctions. Seats were readily offered by white, black and
Hispanic riders, by teen-agers in outrageously baggy shorts and by
middle-aged women in business suits.
</P>
<P>
   By rumor, by reputation and even by scientific study, New
Yorkers are widely held to be a tough crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, Robert Levine, chairman of the psychology
department at California State University at Fresno, performed an
elaborate study measuring helpfulness in 36 American cities. The
transplanted Brooklynite surprised no one by discovering that New
Yorkers were the least willing to assist a stranger with a small
act of kindness, like mailing a lost letter or giving change for a
quarter. And when they did help, they were demonstrably the
surliest.
</P>
<P>
   What did Levine think of this columnist's rather more sunny
findings?
</P>
<P>
   He claimed not to be shocked at all. ``It doesn't surprise me
that you are getting treated pretty nicely,'' he said in a
telephone interview.
</P>
<P>
   The subway seat experiment, he pointed out, was framed in such a
way that made it easy for New Yorkers to show their best side.
Giving up a seat is an act of generosity that by its very nature
limits contact: you stay, I leave.
</P>
<P>
   In his study, Levine said, New Yorkers had also been willing to
practice this kind of help-and-run philanthropy. What they had
balked at was entering more open-ended relationships with
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   In other cities, people encountering a researcher posing as a
blind pedestrian on a street corner would often come up alongside
and offer to guide him across. In New York, they were more likely
to start across the street themselves and then call back, ``The
light's green!''
</P>
<P>
   ``When people did help,'' he explained, ``it was always where
there was no commitment for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on Levine's grim interpretation of the data, this
columnist had to agree that he had a point. In all her trips, no
one stopped to chat with her after giving up a seat. In several
cases, even the offer itself was made wordlessly through a kind of
urban pantomime.
</P>
<P>
   At other times, the generous rider accompanied the offer with an
apology. ``I'm sorry, I just noticed,'' one woman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't looking,'' said another, who had been deeply immersed
in her copy of The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   Waiting to be noticed on a subway, one is forced to notice just
how actively people are trying not to notice one another,
retreating behind newspapers, books, catalogs, makeup mirrors or
plain fatigue. At one point, on the uptown No. 1, this columnist
found herself standing in front of three riders, all of whom were
either genuinely asleep or feigning it.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she would like to draw if not exactly a happy conclusion
about the state of civility in the city, then at least not an
ungrateful one. Even if the pregnant-woman-needing-a-subway-seat
experiment didn't test the trickier question of trust and
commitment, it did test for simple fellow-feeling. And it was a
relief, quite literally, to be offered all those seats by so many
well-meaning strangers.

NEW HOTEL, BUS TOURS: TOURISTS FLOCK TO BROOKLYN  
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By THOMAS J. LUECK 
 
c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In Manhattan, sure. But Brooklyn? Still, there they
are, those big red double-decker tourist buses chugging past Fulton
Landing, around Grand Army Plaza and in the shadow of the sleek,
new Marriott that is to open Tuesday as Brooklyn's first large new
hotel in 68 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody has heard something about Brooklyn,'' said Claudia
Pongratz, a tourist from Munich, Germany, who squeezed onto the
upper level of a double decker the other day with other first-time
visitors to New York City's most populous borough, most of them
from Europe. ``It is part of America I have always wanted to see.''
</P>
<P>
   In the latest wrinkle in a buoyant surge of tourism that has
swept New York for more than two years, Brooklyn, that historically
rich, much maligned place that the Dodgers, Barbra Streisand and
Woody Allen left, is suddenly on the itinerary. At least for an
intrepid few.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn business people, and the visitors themselves, offer
several reasons for the borough's new popularity. As in much of the
city, fear of crime has subsided. Many North American visitors can
trace ancestors to Brooklyn, travelers from Europe are attracted by
the elegance and history of the borough's brownstones and churches,
and many tourists come simply for a brief glimpse of traditional,
middle-income residential areas in a city that is normally defined
by the extremes of architecture, finance and human relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to see where we live and get a feeling for our
ethnicity,'' said JoAnne Meyers, manager of the Brooklyn Tourism
Council, a four-year-old group whose Web page
(http://www.brooklynx.org/whoweare/tourism) has been attracting
hits in recent months from across Europe, Argentina, Israel and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are like a human zoo,'' she said. ``Everybody wants to come
and see how we live together because we do it so well.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the attraction, the emergence of Brooklyn as a tourist
destination _ or at least an excursion for visitors to Manhattan _
is evident in the growing popularity of its cultural institutions,
and in large new investments in its tourism and lodging businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Foremost among them is the 376-room Marriott in downtown
Brooklyn next to Metrotech, the huge office and university complex
that was built in the 1980's as one of New York City's most
sweeping urban renewal projects. The hotel fills the lower seven
floors of a 32-story building, where the higher floors _ and
unbroken views of Manhattan _ are claimed by the office of the
Brooklyn District Attorney, an insurance company and other business
tenants.
</P>
<P>
   The hotel is intended mainly as a destination for business
travelers because of its proximity to Metrotech. Its large
underground garage will allow easier access by car than most
Manhattan hotels, and Marriott says its weeknight room rates of
$180 to $230 are at least 20 percent below those at comparable
hotels in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   But Marriott executives said they planned to promote the hotel
aggressively to tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tourism is already catching on in Brooklyn, and we think we
can spur a lot more,'' said Mitchell Heymann, director of marketing
for the hotel, formally the New York Marriott Brooklyn, which has
booked almost all its rooms next weekend for a convention of black
businesswomen. He said that group may provide an example of the
kind of guests who will enhance Brooklyn's reputation as a tourist
stop, since they can be expected to explore neighborhoods elsewhere
in the borough.
</P>
<P>
   Marriott's nearest competitor in Brooklyn is the 150-room Golden
Gate Motor Inn in Sheepshead Bay. Long gone are the opulent hotels
in Brooklyn Heights that rivaled those of Manhattan, like the
towering St. George, completed in 1930 and now a cooperative
apartment house, and the 90-year-old Bossert, which attracted movie
stars in the 1920s, and is now a residential building owned by the
Jehovah's Witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   To fill the lodging void, bed-and-breakfasts have sprung up in
several of the borough's best preserved brownstone neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to come with some trepidation, but now they are
enthralled,'' said Harry Paul, owner of the Baisley House, a
two-year-old Carroll Gardens bed-and-breakfast inn in a
145-year-old brownstone once owned by Susan Hayward. The largest
share of the inn's clientele is made up of European tourists and
American business travelers, he said, and demand is so strong for
the three guest rooms that he is already taking weekend
reservations for 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The growing number of visitors has provided a lift for the
borough's largest cultural institutions, including the Brooklyn
Academy of Music and the Brooklyn Botanic Garden. The borough's
rising cultural star, at least over the last year, has been the
Brooklyn Museum of Art, where attendance has doubled.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we are at a major turning point for tourism in
Brooklyn, and this building is bustling,'' said Sally Williams, a
spokeswoman for the museum, where attendance had declined for years
until it bottomed out at about 255,000 a year _ dismally low for a
major art museum _ through most of the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last year, she said, the combination of heightened
interest among tourists and two hugely popular exhibitions _
paintings by Monet and the museum's current show, ``Jewels of the
Romanovs,'' which ends Sunday _ have created a surge of attendance.
Although attendance figures for the fiscal year that ended June 30
are still being tallied, she said it would easily exceed 500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Still, for all its historic, ethnic and cultural appeal,
Brooklyn remains primarily a residential place, not ideally suited
for oversized buses rumbling down the block or tour groups peering
into people's living rooms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We love the tourists, but they are just going to have to visit
us on foot,'' said Judy Stanton, executive director of the Brooklyn
Heights Association, a homeowners' group that for years has
resisted efforts by tour operators to drive their buses along the
neighborhood's somnolent side streets, or to park at the entrances
to the scenic Brooklyn Heights Promenade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This neighborhood was laid out with dirt lanes in the 19th
century,'' she said. ``There is simply no room for tour buses.''
</P>
<P>
   Such resistance has done much to influence the tours now being
offered in Brooklyn by Manhattan's two biggest double-decker bus
operators, Gray Line Tours and New York Apple Tours.
</P>
<P>
   Gray Line, which for years has offered an excursion to the
promenade on summer nights, agreed this year for the first time to
park its buses at a staging area blocks away. But in response to a
surge in tourist demand, it has also expanded its service from one
to three buses each night, with tour guides speaking French,
German, Italian and Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   By far the largest new tour service is by New York Apple Tours,
which started Brooklyn trips in May and now has buses regularly
making a broad circuit from the waterfront under the Brooklyn
Bridge to the Botanic Garden on Eastern Parkway and back through
Brooklyn's downtown commercial district.

NEW SMOKING TRIAL TESTS INDUSTRY'S RESOLVE 
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds: CORRECTS amount sought in 2nd graf to $100 billion)  (nk) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The resolve of cigarette makers to fight lawsuits following the
collapse of last year's nationwide settlement plan faces its
toughest test Monday with the start of a large class-action case
brought on behalf of smokers in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The case, in which an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 people are
seeking some $100 billion in compensatory and punitive damages, is
the nation's first class-action lawsuit involving smokers to come
to trial. Jury selection will begin Monday and is expected to take
three to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The trial will unfold in stages, with the first one determining
whether producers are liable for tobacco-related health problems
and should face punitive damages.
</P>
<P>
   The case comes at an uncertain point in the course of tobacco
litigation. Last month, in a rare victory for plaintiffs, a Florida
jury ordered Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp. to pay $1 million,
including $500,000 in punitive damages, to the family of a smoker.
But just days later, a Florida appeals court struck down a 1996
jury award of $750,000 against Brown &AMP; Williamson, holding that the
smoker in that case had waited too long to sue and that evidence
had been improperly admitted at the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Sugarman, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley and an expert on tobacco litigation, said he
believed that the trial's first phase would be critical. The
industry will try to knock out the case, he said, and if that
fails, it will move to settle it, despite recent tough talk against
settlements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the plaintiffs must hope that if they can win Round 1
then the industry will come to the bargaining table,'' Sugarman
said.
</P>
<P>
   If jurors hold producers liable, and there is no settlement, the
jury will next hear the cases of six smokers representing the
class. In the third stage, the claim of each class member will be
reviewed to see whether their illness was smoking-related.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Rosenblatt, the Miami lawyer who brought the lawsuit,
estimated the number of class members at 100,000 to 200,000. And
legal experts like Sugarman said that a case-by-case review of
those claims would be so cumbersome that producers would be likely
to settle if the case proved unfavorable.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, no one is talking about settling. Robert C. Heim, a
lawyer for Philip Morris, said that tobacco producers planned to
stake their defense on data showing that the public was aware of
smoking risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are dealing with the issue of personal choice and
responsibility,'' Heim said.
</P>
<P>
   The suit claims that the industry knowingly addicted smokers and
then failed to adequately warn them.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thrust of our case is that the tobacco industry attempted
through diversionary tactics to keep alive a nonexistent scientific
controversy about smoking and health,'' Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   He is no stranger to the tobacco industry. Last year, he and his
wife, Susan, who is also a lawyer, scored a major victory when
producers agreed to pay $300 million to settle a lawsuit brought on
behalf of 60,000 flight attendants who had claimed injury from
secondhand smoke.
</P>
<P>
   But the case also generated some disputes. Alan Morrison, a
lawyer with Public Citizen, an advocacy group, said that his group
objected to the settlement on behalf of some flight attendants
because its financial benefits went to establish a nonprofit
foundation to research smoking-related diseases rather than to
class members. And he described as excessive the $49 million in
fees and expenses paid under the settlement to the Rosenblatts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was obviously able to persuade the tobacco industry to part
with over $350 million and for that I give him great credit,''
Morrison said. ``But our problem is that the money did not go to
the class.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Judge Robert Kaye, who oversaw the flight attendant
case and was assigned to handle the new lawsuit, backed the
settlement. And Rosenblatt, who said he could not discuss the
matter because it was under appeal, said that flight attendants did
not show up at a recent court hearing to object to the settlement
terms.
</P>
<P>
   The lead plaintiff in the current case is Dr. Howard Engle, a
retired pediatrician in Miami Beach who filed suit in 1994.

LOS ANGELES POLITICIANS LOOKING AHEAD TO 21ST CENTURY CONTESTS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY RICK ORLOV 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles -- In the political arena of Los Angeles -- heated
up by charter reform, secession and term limits -- it's already
2001 and the race for mayor is on.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it is in some governmental meeting, a cable talk show or
a news conference, the 2001 campaign has politicians beginning to
position and posture for the right to succeed Mayor Richard
Riordan.
</P>
<P>
   Some examples:
</P>
<P>
   --Los Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky announces plans
for an initiative to block all future rail construction, after a
line is built to North Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   --Councilwoman Laura Chick announces she will hold hearings into
whether police let a terrorist bank robber bleed to death in last
year's North Hollywood shootout.
</P>
<P>
   --City Attorney James Hahn has a series of news conferences
announcing legal action against the proposed Ward Valley nuclear
dump, against the Census Bureau for a potential undercount of
ethnic minorities and against California Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush over auto insurance rates.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't even include folks like Assembly Speaker Antonio
Villaraigosa, county Supervisor Gloria Molina, City Councilman Nate
Holden and Parks Commission President Steve Soboroff, among others,
all of whom have become increasingly active in recent months,
seizing every opportunity to make headlines.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, public interest appears to be peaking in a
city that has become notorious for its voter apathy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have some pretty interesting debate going on in this city
about the nature of government and politics that I haven't seen
since Tom Bradley was elected mayor in 1973,'' political analyst
Sherry Bebitch Jeffe said. ``This is something a political
scientist lives for.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason for the heightened debate is due to Riordan.
He was the force behind term limits that will take him out of
office in 2001 and create the open field. Many of the council
members who would run for mayor or other citywide office also are
termed out of their council seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this era of term limits, none of them are secure in their
jobs,'' Democratic political consultant Joe Cerrell. ``Once they
get elected the first time, they begin looking for what their next
job will be.''
</P>
<P>
   With his election as a citizen-politician and vow to turn L.A.
around in 1993, Riordan also has been the catalyst for many of the
heightened expectations that have heated up the debate.
</P>
<P>
   To head off San Fernando Valley efforts to secede from the city,
Riordan became the driving force behind an elected panel to reform
Los Angeles' Byzantine City Charter, prompting the City Council to
respond by creating its own commission.
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, the City Council has left the comfort of its
chambers at least once a month and routinely drawn hundreds of
people to its meetings, compared to the two dozen or three dozen
who venture downtown. But several meetings have added fuel to the
political fires because their start was delayed for an hour or so
by the lack of a 10-member quorum.
</P>
<P>
   In the current climate, issues that might have created small
ripples have gotten far more attention from the media and
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels very volatile. ... There is a strong feeling of
frustration and anger,'' Chick said. ``Conflict is usually not
easy, and it means you have to work it out. But at least people are
active, interested and involved. Out of that can come good
things.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be the case with the federal civil rights lawsuit filed
against the city by the West Valley Girls Softball League &UR;  &LR; -- a
question of equal access to the city parks' playing fields for boys
and girls that turned into a dispute with repercussions for the
mayoral politics of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Chick, who had been working with the girls softball league to
try to find a solution, wants to develop an overall city policy on
the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Mike Feuer also jumped into the act, holding a
hearing last week to begin collecting information on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffe, however, said she doesn't believe the one issue will have
long-term implications, beyond possibly raising Soboroff's profile.
</P>
<P>
   Soboroff is the least known of all the officials considering a
run for mayor in 2001, despite his high-profile assignments on the
Parks Commission and as Riordan's personal choice to head a citizen
committee to oversee school bond spending.
</P>
<P>
   In those roles, Soboroff has positioned himself as the outside
critic. But the softball suit places him squarely in the middle of
both defending a city agency and finding a solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of positive stuff happening,'' he said. ``People
are coming together and trying to work something out. What I see is
all of us coming together and trying to use this to make Valley
baseball a model for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many political insiders believe Soboroff walked into a political
minefield by calling for hearings on the issue to promote more
playing fields citywide. But it's a gamble that could pay off in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always seen as the mayor's guy, which is not necessarily
bad,'' Jeffe said of Soboroff. ``But if it raises his profile _
particularly in the Valley _ it can only help him.''
</P>
<P>
   The San Fernando Valley almost certainly will be crucial in
2001. The Valley provided Riordan with the margin needed for his
first election, and it was the Valley that made up better than half
the vote in last year's election.

<P>
   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   I was riding home on the No. 3 train during rush hour when a
mother, babe-in-arms, and a little boy with a bag of potato chips
came into the car. The little boy bounced down next to me and
continued working on the chips. The mother was standing.
</P>
<P>
   I am aged and not inhibited about offering gentle criticism. I
asked the boy whether he didn't think his mother would like to sit.
Without missing a chip, he bellowed: ``Ma, do you want to sit?''
</P>
<P>
   She said ``no'' just as he added, ``cause there's a woman here
who wants to give you her seat.''
</P>

   The 60ish man was slightly paunchy but nattily dressed as he
stepped onto the 66th Street crosstown bus. After several tries, he
still couldn't get his Metrocard properly placed in the slot. Trudy
Linfield was sitting behind the driver and enjoyed this exchange:
</P>
<P>
   Driver: ``You have terrible technique.''
</P>
<P>
   Passenger: ``I have to hear that from you, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know New York is a tough town,'' writes Richard Donsky, but
this sign in Soho struck him as extreme: ``Unauthorized Parkers:
License plates will be removed, air will be taken out of tires.''
</P>
<P>
   How do you define a New Yorker? Susan Welsher Jereski was in a
restaurant recently sitting next to two women discussing their
apartments.
</P>
<P>
   One said she had a terrace. The other sniffed: ``I wouldn't want
a terrace. I'm not the outdoorsy type.''

   Dear Diary:
</P>
<P>
   The young businessman, busy at his laptop, smelling faintly of
gin, was sprawled over three seats during the rush hour on the E
train. To his left were reference books; to his right, a briefcase
and papers.
</P>
<P>
   As I indicated I would like a seat, he pointed to an elderly
lady, snoozing and occupying two seats and asked, ``Why don't you
sit over there?''
</P>
<P>
   I told him this was a subway and not his office; he gathered his
things and moved over, muttering, ``You should have some common
courtesy when you see people working.''
</P>
<P>
   After a while, my eyes wandered to his laptop display which
said:
</P>
<P>
   ``The New York subways are full of jackasses. This 40-45 year
old man just disrupted my work by demanding to sit next to me. What
a jerk.''
</P>
<P>
   I took out my notebook and started writing my version of this
encounter.
</P>
<P>
   The man continued typing:
</P>
<P>
   ``The bozo's taken out a notebook and I think he's writing about
me.''
</P>
<P>
   It would have been interesting to see where this would have
gone, but I had to get off. Still, he made my day. I'm 58.

   Dominick Coviello was in a Kmart looking for a good buy in
litter for his ferrets and discovered a brand he had not seen
before. The shape of the bucket was unusual; it held 25 rather than
22 pounds and the price was $1 less than that of the smaller
amount.
</P>
<P>
   He was so pleased with his find that he tried to share it with a
fellow shopper whom he presumed was also in search of a best buy.
Did he get any appreciation? No.
</P>
<P>
   The other litter shopper wasn't interested: ``I'm a little more
concerned with quality,'' he said.

   My mother, a psychoanalyst, received a message on her answering
machine that was intended for someone else.
</P>
<P>
   The caller, thinking he was leaving a message for ``John,''
announced that he was going to be on television that night and
named the time and channel.
</P>
<P>
   My mother was distressed because he did not leave a return phone
number.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so excited about being on television,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, what did you do?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   To which she replied: ``What could I do, I went home and
watched.''

   Madeline Greenberg was waiting her turn at her favorite hot-dog
vendor on First Avenue and 34th Street when the young man in front
of her asked for mayo on his large spicy sausage.
</P>
<P>
   The vendor picked up a plastic bottle and squirted the pale
dressing along the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Greenberg couldn't help it. She looked at the customer and
said: `You're not from New York, are you?''

   The day Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel was on the
East Side of Manhattan, Julia Koenig and Cara Eckert were walking
down Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   They were behind a couple who Ms. Koenig defined as ``clearly
tourists, maps hanging out of their pockets, cameras hung around
their necks and walking much more slowly than the natives.''
</P>
<P>
   The husband said to the wife: ``What do you think all the cement
barriers and wooden horses along the sidewalk are for?''
</P>
<P>
   The wife replied: ``I think they keep the tourists away from the
residences.''

   I was walking my Shetland sheepdog in Greenwich Village when she
suddenly lunged for something on the street and started chomping
away.
</P>
<P>
   In exasperation, I shouted, ``What on earth have you picked up
this time?''
</P>
<P>
   Behind me, I heard a childlike high-pitched voice say, ``I don't
know and I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   I turned around to find a young man with a big grin on his face
who had decided to speak for my dog. We laughed. The dog did not
comment.

   It was intermission at a Sunday afternoon performance of ``The
Beauty Queen of Leenane.'' As usual, there was a long line for the
ladies' room and a much shorter one for the men's room. Four women
decided to join the men's line, and one was finally admitted when a
chivalrous male announced that a stall was free.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Ebert was one of the men who heard her proclaiming loudly
``I'm not looking, I'm not looking,'' as she walked in.
</P>
<P>
   When she emerged, she observed to the one friend still on line,
``I tell you Debby, it's just like I was Ally McBeal.''

   NEW YORK _ A gunman on a bicycle rode up to a barbecue in
Brooklyn early Sunday morning and opened fire, striking a
16-year-old who was apparently his intended target, but also
shooting three other people who were attending a family reunion in
a neighboring back yard, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The shootings occurred just before 1 a.m. Sunday in the back
yard of 1 Miami Court in Prospect Heights, said Officer Leslie
Cardona, a police spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman, who is still being sought, pedaled over and began
shooting at the 16-year-old. The youth, who was not identified, was
struck in the hip and taken to Kings County Hospital Center, where
he was in critical but stable condition, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Several stray bullets hit a family having a reunion in a
neighboring yard about 100 yards away, Cardona said. An 11-year-old
girl, who was not identified, was shot in the leg; Aubry Gonsalves,
64, was struck in the neck, and Ann Gonsalves, 39, had a bullet
graze her elbow, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The reunion had brought members of the Gonsalves family together
from New Jersey and as far away as Texas and Florida. By Sunday
afternoon, the Gonsalveses were released from the hospital, and the
11-year-old was upgraded to stable condition, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just thankful it looks like everyone's going to be all
right,'' said a family member, Dawn Gonsalves.

   NEW YORK _ She lived a long time in Harlem. From its heyday,
when it had swing joints and all-night cocktails, through the
sinewy years, broken glass and rubbled lives, she stayed.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Jean Johnson told her friends that she preferred to stay
uptown, because the rough-and-tumble streets kept her alive.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they killed her.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson, 81, was found dead in her apartment June 26. The
police said she had been strangled with a bicycle chain, raped and
beaten so badly that her body would have to be cremated. She was
left in her bathtub. Detectives surmise that she had let her killer
in. The door was locked from the inside, deadbolted three times. He
probably escaped through a window.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had to be one of them crackheads,'' said Patricia Tanks, a
neighbor. ``She let them in her house. Everybody knew what she had
in there.''
</P>
<P>
   She had furs, boas and mementos from a life well lived, and the
word was that she kept her jewelry in a safe. But after her death,
the police said there was no safe, no matter what she had said.
</P>
<P>
   No one in her neighborhood knew it but Mrs. Johnson had been a
glittering personality of the Harlem Renaissance, her husband a
jazz legend. As Michael McGregor said on the street corner over a
bottle of malt liquor the other day: ``No one around here knows
nothing about jazz. That was another time.'' They did, however, see
the glow of her Tiffany lamps in her apartment, packed with
artifacts
</P>
<P>
   A chocolate-skinned woman with silver hair, Ruby Jean Johnson
appeared as a young woman in black fashion magazines of the 1930s
and early '40s. Among her friends she counted Duke Ellington, Count
Basie and Billie Holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Later in life, she fell in love with Walter Johnson, one of the
top jazz drummers of the '30s and '40s, a member of Fletcher
Henderson's famed orchestra and the man who popularized the use of
the high-hat cymbals as the driving beat in jazz.
</P>
<P>
   In the good times, he kept Mrs. Johnson in furs and limousines,
but when he died in 1977, he left her little more than yellowing
photos. So when the neighborhood was buried in a blizzard of crack
cocaine in the 1980s, she had no place to go. To survive, she
created two lives for herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody lives several lives,'' said her longtime friend,
Vivian Millinder, 72, the widow of Lucky Millinder, the swing band
leader. ``She never told her girlfriends what was going on up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   On the one hand, she remained the urbane socialite, the elegant
woman about town. The other woman was a recluse, a hostage in her
home. Flashy but broke, she was kind to alcoholics and crack
addicts, fed them bread from church. She fed them to feel needed,
her friends supposed, to buy a little dignity in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Ruby Jean Muckleroy was born in the small dust town of
Chattanooga, Okla. In a 1918 photo, the family looks the picture of
American rectitude. Framed by a scraggly tree, her father is in a
dark suit and high starched collar, her mother in petticoats and a
simple linen dress. Soon after the picture was taken, the father
ran off, and the mother, single and alone, put the girl in an
orphanage, said Brooks Kerr, the pianist and a confidant of Mrs.
Johnson in her later years.
</P>
<P>
   She would stay in the institution for eight years, until her
grandmother took her out and brought her to New Rochelle. She left
her grandmother's house at 18 and moved to Greenwich Village in New
York City. To support herself, she racked balls in pool halls,
hustled mugs of beer and lived on the kindness of gentlemen.
</P>
<P>
   Her modeling career began on 132nd Street and Seventh Avenue in
Harlem. It was there that she first saw Walter Johnson. It was also
there that she met a German artist. It was somewhere around 1937.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way she described it, he was like her Professor Higgins
and she was an Eliza Doolittle.'' Kerr said. The German's name is
lost to time, but Mrs. Johnson told her friends that he taught her
how to be beautiful, how to speak. She modeled for him and
magazines.
</P>
<P>
   Their relationship lasted through the war, and then ended.
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1952 that she really became acquainted with Johnson, a
dapper man who spent two hours dressing each morning. He would oil
his hair, examine his face for whiskers before cleaning it with a
soft sponge. He was so slick, even the rain couldn't stick to him,
said Harvard Davis, a jazz trumpeter who played with Ella
Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   She took him in, took his name and they lived for the next
quarter-century at 660 St. Nicholas Ave., a marble-walled building
in the Sugar Hill section, where many famous black personalities
lived.
</P>
<P>
   People say that they were married in 1953 and that they remember
the ceremony at a church with a name they no longer recall. They
say there were flowers and all the famous people attended. But at
the city's Marriage License Bureau, there is no record of their
marriage. Walter Johnson never divorced his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   The couple loved each other, by all accounts. Even when the
music turned sour. Jazz fell out of favor, and Walter Johnson got
less work. He was never interested in money, so more than once,
Ruby Jean had to track down his pay from shady club managers, Mrs.
Millinder said.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1960s, Johnson was working in a bank. His wife still
socialized, and posed nude for struggling painters at the Art
Students League on 57th Street.
</P>
<P>
   But the neighborhood became depressed, and the couple grew old.
Walter Johnson put on his best suit on April 8, 1977, and went to
the hospital for stomach surgery. He never came home.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's first and official wife staked a claim on everything
he owned. Ruby Jean got what was left in her lover's safe deposit
box: two bundles of pictures, wrapped in velvet, of Johnson's
girlfriends.
</P>
<P>
   For the next 20 years, Ruby Jean scraped along, living on a
small Social Security check. She pawned her jewelry and lost the
rest to drug addicts who broke into her apartment countless times.
Last March, she told Kerr of a woman who pushed into her apartment
and threw her to the ground. Ruby Jean, arthritic and struggling
with diabetes, bit half the woman's toe off.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fight keeps me young,'' she told friends. The truth was,
the uptown crowd had always been her crowd. Harlem had given her
everything. And what little she had left, she was killed for.
</P>
<P>
   The police have few suspects despite a $10,000 reward offered by
the mayor. ``The thing that makes me the most sad,'' Mrs. Millinder
said, ``is that of all the beautiful days of her life, the last was
her most horrible day on Earth.''
