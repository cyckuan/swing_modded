<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, Mar 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf Saturday assured U.S. President Bill
Clinton that Pakistan will engage Afghanistan's ruling Taliban on
the issue of terrorism, including the issue of Saudi dissident
Osama bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
Replying to a question during his press conference here
following Clinton's visit, General Musharraf said that Clinton did
raise the issue of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"I totally agree with him on the issue," he said, adding that
Pakistan has always denounced all forms of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He told Clinton that the Osama issue is complicated and no one
has so far succeeded in this regard.
</P>
<P>
However, he said," I assured him to engage Taliban on the issue
of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Osama bin Laden was accused of involvement in the bombings of U.
S. embassies in East Africa in 1998 and Washington has kept
efforts for his extradition from Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Ready for Talks with India: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Chief Executive
General Pervez Musharraf said Saturday that Pakistan is prepared
to engage in talks with India "at anytime, anywhere and at any
level."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a crowded press conference here after holding talks
with visiting U.S. President Bill Clinton, Musharraf said the
dialogue should not deflect from the centrality of the Kashmir
issue.
</P>
<P>
He said, he expected reciprocity from India to his offer of
talks.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said, the U.S. president showed understanding on the
issue of Kashmir and emphasized the need for the resumption of
dialogue and reducing tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
"I certainly made it clear that unilateral action is not
possible by Pakistan; we accepted that there ought to be dialogue
on the issue," Musharraf said.
</P>
<P>
The chief executive said Clinton has assured to use his good
offices to facilitate dialogue between Pakistan and India.
</P>
<P>
"Yes, he did assure to use his good offices in facilitating the
dialogue," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Kashmir issue is a long-running dispute between Pakistan
and India for which the two neighbors fought two of their three
wars during the past 53 years.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton, who visited Pakistan Saturday as the last
leg of his three-nation South Asian tour, had also expressed his
hope for Indo-Pak talks in India but failed to convince New Delhi
of the imperativeness of dialogue.

<HEADLINE> Khatami Calls for Uprooting Political Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
on Sunday called for coordinated efforts to eradicate the root
cause of political violence in his country.
</P>
<P>
The call came in the wake of an assassination attempt against a
leading reformer and his close adviser, Saeed Hajjarian, who was
shot in the face by two unidentified gunmen two week ago.
</P>
<P>
Khatami requested a thorough investigation into the attempt, and
urged security forces to intensify efforts with maximum vigilance
to track down those responsible, according to the official news
agency IRNA.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi, Khatami asked
all government and security agencies to coordinate and cooperate
with the Intelligence Ministry to bring the case to a fair end.
</P>
<P>
The terrorist attempt against Hajjarian was among dangerous
conspiracies which, if successful, will "block the way of freedom,
construction and sovereignty of law and order," he added.
</P>
<P>
Hajjarian, 46, was shot and severely wounded in front of the
Tehran municipal council building on March 12 as tensions ran high
following the landslide victory of reformers over their
conservative opponents in last month's sensitive parliamentary
elections.
</P>
<P>
Serving as Khatami's adviser, Hajjarian is also vice chairman of
the municipal council and head of the reformist daily Sobh-e Emrouz
(This Morning).
</P>
<P>
Yunesi said on Saturday that 10 people had been arrested in
connection with the assassination attempt. But he said the suspects
were not affiliated to any group or institution or foreigners, but
had carried out the terror act on their own and out of personal
feelings and motivations.
</P>
<P>
However, widespread rumors had it that the act was a revenge by
the conservatives, who still dominate the country's most sensitive
organs, because Hajjarian played an important role in reformers'
landslide victory in the parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Doctors treating Hajjarian said on Saturday that he had almost
regained full consciousness after being in a coma for days. He can
now recognize relatives and communicate with people at his bedside
by eye movement and also by nodding.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Backs Balancing Oil Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia on Sunday
reaffirmed its position of supporting actions to balance the world
oil market to safeguard the interests of oil producers and ensure a
continuous growth of the world economy.
</P>
<P>
"The Kingdom is keen on ensuring the stability of oil supplies
and prices at a reasonable levels," said a statement issued after a
meeting of the Saudi Supreme Petroleum and Mineral Affairs Council,
the Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The meeting of the Saudi council, which was held in the western
Saudi city of Jeddah, came just on the eve of the ministerial
meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC)
due in Vienna Monday.
</P>
<P>
Oil ministers of the cartel are to decide whether member states
will raise production to cool off high prices or maintain the
present output cuts policy.
</P>
<P>
Most OPEC producers including the group's heavyweight Saudi
Arabia have hinted at supporting the move to slightly increase
crude supplies.
</P>
<P>
In his remarks earlier this month, Saudi Crown Prince and Deputy
Prime Minister Abdullah Ibn Abdul-Aziz said that "there is
currently an imbalance between supply and demand...and I am
convinced that OPEC members will take appropriate decision that
will restore balance and stability to the market."
</P>
<P>
"We will try through collective action to restore market
stability in a way to guarantee the interests of the producing
countries and not to damage the world economy," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 16 people lost their lives
and another six were injured in a road accident in Iran's western
province of Hamadan, traffic police announced on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The accident happened on the Malayer-Boroujerd road on Saturday
when a minibus heading to Boroujerd hit a trailer on the opposite
traffic lane, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
The collision was caused by the minibus' illegal overtaking,
police said, and the injured were taken to the local hospitals.
</P>
<P>
IRNA reported earlier that a bus collided with a trailer on the
road between the central cities of Qom and Kashan on Saturday
afternoon, killing 13 people and injuring 10 others.
</P>
<P>
The overspeed of the bus caused the tragic incident. The driver
of the bus was among the dead.
</P>
<P>
Iranian traffic police always complain that the rate of traffic
accidents in Iran is some 200 times of the average in the world, a
result of negligence of Iranian drivers.

<HEADLINE> Assad, Clinton End Summit With Results Pending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and U.S. President Bill Clinton ended their five-hour summit
Sunday in Geneva with no word on the outcome of the talks but a
joint statement on the summit devoted to restarting Syria-Israeli
negotiations expected shortly.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held their first talks since 1994 at Geneva's
Hotel Intercontinental under tight security. Also present were
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and U.S. secretary of
state Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the meeting, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said it was unlikely that the two leaders would announce an
immediate renewal of the negotiations, which have been stalled
since January.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected Assad would return to Damascus for
consultations, and that Clinton would talk to Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke off in January after Syria demanded that Israel
commit itself to returning the entire Golan Heights before other
issues could be discussed. But despite the official deadlock,
there has been growing evidence that talks are continuing behind
the scenes, and that a deal could be close.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has emphasized that it is willing to host further
summit meetings, and there are indications that Clinton and Assad
may have been discussing preparations for another meeting in
Geneva, perhaps also attended by Israel and Lebanon, in a matter
of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Berger said one of the main challenges was to increase
confidence between Israel and Syria so that both sides are
prepared to compromise to secure a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"They both have to compromise but they both have to believe
that they are stronger and better positioned as a result of
reaching a peace agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> Kaunda's Retirement from Party Politics Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambian former President and
leader of the biggest opposition party, the United National
Independence Party (UNIP), Kenneth Kaunda has decided to quit
party politics, his son Waza Kaunda confirmed here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview, he told Xinhua that his father made
the decision in order to concentrate his efforts on helping settle
regional conflicts and HIV/AIDS problems.
</P>
<P>
He said that his father also want to give way to younger
generations of UNIP, as late Tanzanian President Julius Nyerere
and former South African President Nelson Mandela and Botswanan
President Ketumile Masire did.
</P>
<P>
Waza, a special assistant of his father, said a lot of UNIP
members do not accept Kaunda's retirement, urging him to continue
to lead UNIP.
</P>
<P>
Waza expressed his confidence that UNIP can win the 2001
general elections even without his father, though it will be a
hard work.
</P>
<P>
He said about six people including UNIP Chairman Malimba
Masheke are eyeing the presidency of the UNIP, which will hold a
national congress next month to elect new party leader.
</P>
<P>
Waza said his father, who returned here Sunday from South
Africa, will hold a press conference next week to announce his
decision to Zambians.
</P>
<P>
On Friday Kaunda, 77 years old, announced in South Africa that
he will retire from active politics.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda ruled Zambia after its independence from British
colonial rule in 1964 until 1991, when he was defeated by
incumbent President Frederick Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 elections Kaunda was barred from contesting the
position because his Malawian parentage.
</P>
<P>
In that year a constitutional amendment was adopted to bar
those whose parents are foreign immigrants from contesting the
country's presidency.
</P>
<P>
However, Kaunda vowed repeatedly to run for the presidency in
the next general elections despite the government utterance that
Kaunda is not qualified for it.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile within his party a number of opponents demand his
stepdown to give way to younger hands.
</P>
<P>
His rival Chiluba has also repeatedly urged him to quit party
politics to be respected as founding father of the country like
Nyerere of Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda resigned from UNIP soon after his party lost in the 1991
 elections but he returned to UNIP in 1994 and was elected UNIP
presidency in 1995.
</P>
<P>
On December 25 of 1997, three days after his return from
overseas trip, Kaunda was arrested for his alleged involvement in
the coup attempt of October 28 of 1997.
</P>
<P>
On June 1, 1998, Kaunda was released and in return for the
release Kaunda announced his retirement from party politics three
days later.
</P>
<P>
However at the end of 1998 Kaunda broke his promise and vowed
not to retire from politics, saying no body can prevent him from
contesting the 2001 elections.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Meets Resigning U.N. Relief Official for Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on
Sunday met Hans von Sponeck, the outgoing U.N. humanitarian
coordinator in Iraq, reported the Iraqi News Agency (INA).
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Sponeck expressed his happiness to meet the
Iraqi president and also his regret for not speaking Arabic, said
INA.
</P>
<P>
Saddam said that it is all right because one can understand
humanitarian language even without words, INA added. "Your stance
is an expressing language," Saddam was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck said he resigned as the U.N. humanitarian program he
heads has proven to be a failure, while the Iraqi president said
that Sponeck has done something great for the Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
As the top U.N. relief official for Iraq, von Sponeck submitted
his resignation to U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan last month.
Annan has accepted his resignation, which is to go into force at
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The outspoken U.N. official has said that he resigned because he
has lost hope of an improvement in Iraq's humanitarian situation.
</P>
<P>
He has criticised that the decade-long U.N. sanctions on Iraq
has resulted in a true humanitarian tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Von Sponeck, who was appointed to the post in October 1998, has
angered the U.S. and Britain by saying that the U.N. Security
Council should treat Iraq's humanitarian needs separately from the
Council's aim to monitor Baghdad's disarmament.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.N. oil-for-food program has not met the minimum
requirements of the 22 million Iraqi people.
</P>
<P>
Under the humanitarian program now in its seventh phase, Iraq is
allowed to export a certain amount of oil in every six months to
buy basic supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq has long argued that this program has failed to
alleviate the sufferings of the Iraqi people who have been reeling
under the crippling U.N. sanctions imposed following Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.

<P>
Amman, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdel Rauf
Rawabdeh on Sunday called for closer and cooperative ties between
Amman and Beijing as part of the efforts to consolidate bilateral
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh made the appeal in a meeting with Beijing Mayor Liu Qi,
who is heading a delegation from the Beijing Municipality on three-
day friendly visit to Jordan at the invitation of his Amman
counterpart Nedal Hadeed.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the prime minister said Amman and Beijing
shared the same aspiration for development and progress, and
further cooperation between the two capitals will help develop
relations between the two countries as a whole.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh briefed Liu on Jordan's efforts led by His Majesty King
Abdullah Bin Hussein to develop its national economy, particularly
on the monarch's interests to build the kingdom into an information
technology and software center in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also thanked China for supporting the just causes of
Arabs.
</P>
<P>
For his part, Liu Qi welcomed the idea of producing a working
strategy to develop ties between the two capitals and affirmed
China's willingness to enhance cooperation with Jordan.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Barak, Clinton Keep Phone Contacts During Geneva Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton on
Sunday called Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak at least two times
during his summit meeting with Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in
Geneva, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The first phone contact took place minutes before Clinton and
Assad began their historic meeting in Geneva's Intercontinental
Hotel, and Barak and Clinton were on line second time during a
recession of the summit later, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Barak's office declined to disclose any more details about the
telephone conversations between the two leaders, however, it is
widely believed that Clinton was consulting with Barak about
Israel's stands on some critical issues in the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which resumed last December after a 45-month break,
broke off again in January over a dispute on the fate of the Golan
Heights, a strategic plateau which Israel seized from Syria in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The Geneva summit, which announced by Clinton last Monday, was
still in progress. It is expected that Clinton and Assad will issue
a joint statement afterwards, but they will stop short of holding a
joint press conference.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Clinton would play as a proxy between Israel
and Syria to ask for Assad's response to Israeli proposals on
issues discussed in previous talks, which is the reason the
American president kept phone contacts with Barak.
</P>
<P>
The control of coastal areas along the Lake Kineret, or Sea of
Galilee, looms as the main stumbling block that the negotiations
are likely to face. Israel wants to retain complete control of the
source of 40 percent of its water, while Syria says that it will
never surrender an inch of its territories.
</P>
<P>
Although the border question seems to have eclipsed all other
matters, there are also many gaps that have to be bridged, such as
in security, water and normalization issues.
</P>
<P>
Most analysts regarded this summit as the last chance for
reviving the peace talks in the next few years, while pointing out
that if there were no deal under way, the two leaders would not
waste time to meet.
</P>
<P>
If the meeting became a flop, Clinton will place his remaining
energies elsewhere as his days in the White House are numbered,
forgetting his ambitious aim to turn his farewell party into a
victory celebration and lay the carpet for the award ceremony of a
Nobel Peace Prize at his feet.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Assad, 69, whose health conditions are in doubt for
a long time, will not bother anymore to travel abroad to make peace
efforts with Israel if this summit with Clinton failed to do so.
</P>
<P>
He will then concentrate his last efforts on the smooth
transition of power in Syria to his favorite son Bashar, according
to Israel media reports.
</P>
<P>
Despite some optimistic predictions from media, both American
and Israeli officials tried to play down expectations by saying
that there is no guarantee that the resumption of Israeli-Syrian
talks will be imminent.
</P>
<P>
Speaking hours before the summit at Israeli cabinet weekly
meeting, Barak said the chances for the continuation of the peace
talks with Syria are only "fifty-to-fifty."

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cannonade Hits Lebanon Red Cross' Car </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli forces bombed south Lebanon
at 6:30 a.m. (local time) on Sunday, hitting a vehicle of the
Lebanon Red Cross in the city of Nabatiye.
</P>
<P>
The cannonade also damaged several civilian cars in the city
while there were no reports of casualties so far.
</P>
<P>
At 11:30 a.m. (local time), Israeli jets raided the region of
Iglem Tufaah.
</P>
<P>
Israel carved out a "security zone" in 1985 in south Lebanon
saying it needed to protect its northern settlements from cross-
border guerrilla attacks.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian- and Syrian-backed Hezbollah guerrillas have been
spearheading a war of attrition to end the Israeli control over
south Lebanon, the last active Arab-Israeli battlefront.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, the Israeli cabinet approved Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's plan to withdraw troops from south Lebanon by July.
But Hezbollah repeatedly announced they will not cease fire until
the completion of the Israeli pullout.

<HEADLINE> Iran Kills 7 Afghan Drug Traffickers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian Army have busted two
Afghan drug rings and killed seven traffickers near Iran's eastern
borders, a military officer said here on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rapid deployment divisions of the infantry also seized nine
kilograms of opium and seven firearms from the drug traffickers in
the encounter on Saturday, the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The infantry divisions have been deployed along 900 kilometers
of Iran's eastern borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan since
September 1998 following the tension mounted between Iran and the
Afghan Taliban militia.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban forces stormed the Iranian consulate general in
Mazari Sharif in August 1998 and killed eight Iranian diplomats and
an IRNA reporter inside it after the militia took over the
stronghold of the anti-Taliban Northern Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Iran is a main transit route for drugs smuggled from
Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and neighboring
Pakistan to Europe and oil-rich Gulf Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, a security force commander said that Iran
had seized 240 tons of various drugs in the last Iranian calendar
year which ended on March 19.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Russian presidential election
held Sunday is declared valid as voter turnout exceeded 50 percent,
the Federal Information Center on Presidential Elections
officially announced Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout reached 57.58 percent at 8 p.m. Moscow time (1600
GMT), Central Election Commission deputy chief Valentin Vlasov
said.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's electoral law, the election is considered valid
if voter turnout is more than 50 percent. Otherwise a new election
will be held within four months.
</P>
<P>
By 7 p.m. Moscow time (1500 GMT), voting in 73 of Russia's 89
administrative regions has been announced valid.
</P>
<P>
Some 107.9 million Russians voters go to the polls Sunday to
choose from 11 candidates a new head of state to succeed former
President Boris Yeltsin who resigned on December 31, 1999. Voters
also have an option to vote against all candidates.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win the
election. Recent opinion polls put him at the runaway first place
with approval ratings at between 50 and 60 percent. At stake,
however, is whether Putin will win an outright victory in the
first round or has to claim victory in a run-off.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov was in a distant second place with support of about 25
percent. Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was in the third
place, followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader
of the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's law, a run-off between the two leading
contestants will be held three weeks later if none of the
contenders wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first
round.
</P>
<P>
Putin Sunday refused to comment on his chances of victory in
the first round, saying his rivals should be respected. Both
Zyuganov and Yavlinsky, however, foresee a second round.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results of the voting are expected Sunday night
through Monday morning.

GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Talks between Syrian President

ATHENS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Greek Foreign Minister George
Papandreou would ask his Turkish counterpart, Ismail Cem, for
explanation concerning the entry ban on nine Greeks, including
Archbishop of Athens and All of Greece Christodoulos, the
Macedonia Press Agency (MPA) reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish newspaper report said that Turkey had barred
Archbishop Christodoulos, seven Greek deputies and a retired Greek
naval commander from entering into the neighboring country for
their anti-Turkish sentiment, including support for Kurdish
autonomy.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the issue, Papandreou said that such actions
were the product of fanatic circles in Turkey which wanted to halt
the Greek-Turkish rapprochement process.
</P>
<P>
If the newspaper report was confirmed, he said, the Greek
government would undertake every necessary action towards Turkey
and the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
For decades, Greece and Turkey, both NATO members, have been
at odds for their territorial dispute in the eastern Aegean Sea
and the Cyprus problem, but the two neighboring countries have
since last June begun to improve their strained relations.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Four more bodies of rafters
who went missing in the flooded Storms River in the Eastern Cape
on Saturday were recovered on Sunday, bringing the death toll to
six.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were still missing and two survivors were spotted
by a helicopter in the canyon section of the river gorge, police
spokeswoman Yvette Jonker said.
</P>
<P>
All the adventurers are believed to be South Africans, and
police say it was one of the worst disasters to hit the adventure
tourism market in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jonker said one of the guides managed to get to safety and
grabbed one of the rafters, who were a little while ago spotted
hanging onto rocks in the canyon section of the river.
</P>
<P>
She said the helicopters were unable to rescue them even though
they could see and hear them. Mountain rescuers were trying to get
to the two survivors.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for organizing Storms River adventure said the
river water levels had been normal and rose suddenly.
</P>
<P>
The surge hit as the party of 24 white water rafters in their
tractor tubes approached their exit point from the canyon on the
river.
</P>
<P>
Nine people scramble to safety, but the rest were catapulted
down rapid currents in the gorge, which is very steep and several
hundred meters high.
</P>
<P>
The adventurers were only wearing wet suits without life
jackets, the spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy rains over the past four days had increased the river's
water levels.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Eyes Closer Ties With China: King Abdullah </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
said Sunday that his kingdom was keen to consolidate cooperation
with China, particularly in the field of economy and information
technologies (IT).
</P>
<P>
Abdullah made the remarks during his meeting with Beijing Mayor
Liu Qi, who is heading a delegation of the Beijing Municipality on
a three-day visit to Jordan at the invitation of his Amman
counterpart Nedal Hadeed.
</P>
<P>
The monarch said the kingdom is striving to become an IT center
in the Middle East, and its cooperation with China will serve the
ambition of the energy-sparse kingdom.
</P>
<P>
Jordan would also encourage its entrepreneurs to learn from the
experiences of their Chinese counterparts as joint ventures were
being established between the two countries, and there had been a
good start for Chinese investments in the desert kingdom, Abdullah
added.
</P>
<P>
He also recalled his first visit to China last year since he
acceded to the throne after King Hussein died of cancer in February
1999.
</P>
<P>
He said his father late King Hussein bore profound emotions for
China and the Jordanian-Chinese ties had always been in a good
shape. During his visit to Beijing at the end of 1999, Abdullah
and Chinese leaders agreed to further promote bilateral trade,
which currently stands at 100 million U.S. dollars annually.

<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Switzerland-based Financial
Stability Forum (FSF) ended its two-day meeting here on Sunday
after endorsing a broad range of concrete policy actions aimed at
reducing global financial risks.
</P>
<P>
The policy actions included recommendations on addressing
concerns related to highly leveraged institutions (HLIs), volatile
capital flows, and offshore financial centers (OFCs).
</P>
<P>
The forum listed a package of measures designed to address both
system risk and market dynamics concerns arising from activities
from HLIs, especially hedge funds.

<P>
The measures stressed, among others, risk management practices
and regulatory efforts to address potential risks of HLIs.

<P>
On capital flows, the forum urged national authorities to set
up a risk management framework for overseeing the risks resulting
from large and volatile capital flows.

taken steps to formulate a set of guidelines for sound practice in
sovereign debt and liquidity management, the forum said.
</P>
<P>

international standards by OFCs, particularly with regards to
regulation and supervision, disclosure and information sharing.

priorities, and proposing incentives aimed to enhance their
adherence to international standards.

the Bank For International Settlements (BIS), told reporters that
the FSF would take measures to ensure the implementation of these
recommendations.

that recommendations forward. That person or body will be
requested to report to the forum at its future meetings on
progress that has been achieved," he said.

<HEADLINE> 6 African Leaders to Attend Burundi Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Former South African
President Nelson Mandela, a mediator in the Burundi conflict, has
succeeded in getting assurances from six African heads of state to
attend Burundi peace talks scheduled for Monday.
</P>
<P>
South African Press Association reported on Sunday that
presidents Benjamin Nkapa of Tanzania, Sam Nujoma of Namibia,
Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Pierre Buyoya of Burundi, Yoweri
Museveni of Uganda and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria had confirmed
they planned to attend the talks in the northern Tanzanian town of
Arusha.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted an official involved in mediating the dispute
as saying that Mandela had also invited Libyan leader Moamer
Kadhafi and President Omar Bongo of Gabon to attend. But there has
been no confirmation so far that the two leaders would attend.
</P>
<P>
Late last year, Mandela became a major mediator in the Burundi
conflict which pits a variety of Hutu rebel groups against the
government and army dominated by the country's Tutsi minority.
</P>
<P>
The talks, aimed at ending Burundi's civil war, began in June
1998, but have made little progress.

GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and U.S. President Bill Clinton are holding talks on Middle East
affairs Sunday in Hotel InterContinental here in Geneva amid mixed
signals.
</P>
<P>
Although previous reports indicated that the U.S.-Syrian summit
would revive the interrupted negotiations on Golan Heights between
Syria and Israel, the U.S. is more cautious.
</P>
<P>
Lowering expectations for the summit, National Security Adviser
Sandy Berger said that he was not certain whether Israel and Syria
would resume peace negotiation which broke off in January.
</P>
<P>
Berger said that Clinton would consult with Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak after the meeting while Assad returns to
Damascus to weigh what he learned from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
On March 22, Israel urged Syria to grasp the last chance of the
summit to make peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The meeting could constitute the last opportunity to reach
peace between Syria, Lebanon, and Israel," Israeli Justice
Minister Yossi Beilin said in a statement at the 56th session of
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights.
</P>
<P>
"Peace agreements in the Middle East in fact could be reached
by the end of year 2000. This is a rare opportunity which should
not be missed," he added.
</P>
<P>
While visiting the Middle East last month, Swiss Foreign
Minister Joseph Deiss offered to host a three-way summit between
the United States, Israel and Syria.

<HEADLINE> Russian Presidential Election in 25 Regions Declared Valid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The presidential polling in 25 of
Russia's 89 administrative regions have been declared valid as the
voter turnout in these regions reached 58.23 percent by 5 p.m.
Moscow time (1300 GMT) on Sunday, according to the "Elections 2000
" information center.
</P>
<P>
The overall turnout stood at 43.15 percent at the same time.
</P>
<P>
Earlier reports erroneously put the overall turnout at 58.23
percent.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout is essential because under Russia's electoral
law, the election would be declared invalid and a new election
would be held within four months if voter turnout is lower than 50
percent.
</P>
<P>
Results of the voting are not allowed to be published before
polling in the whole country has been concluded although voting in
regions but European Russia has ended. Russia covers 11 time zones.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected to pour in from 9 p.m. Moscow
time (1700 GMT) and by 3 to 4 a.m. Monday (2300 GMT Sunday to 0000
GMT), 50 percent of the ballots would have been counted. By 10 a.
m., results of more than 90 percent of the votes are expected to
be known.
</P>
<P>
Some 107.9 million Russians voters will choose from 11
candidates a new head of state to succeed former president Boris
Yeltsin who resigned on December 31, 1999. Voters also have an
option to vote against all candidates.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win the
election. Recent opinion polls put him at the runaway first place
with approval ratings at between 50 and 60 percent. At stake,
however, is whether Putin will win an outright victory in the
first round or has to claim victory in a run-off.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov was in a distant second place with support of about 25
percent. Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was in the third
place, followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader
of the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's law, a run-off between the two leading
contestants will be held three weeks later if none of the
contenders wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first
round.

<HEADLINE> Suspected Assailants of Nagorno-Karabakh Leader Arrested </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Suspects in last week's
assassination attempt against Nagorno-Karabakh leader Arkady
Gukasian have been arrested in the Azerbaijani breakaway region,
the Interfax news agency quoted the Prosecutor's Office as saying
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Those arrested have accepted responsibility for the attack and
detailed the degree of their involvement in the crime, Interfax
said.
</P>
<P>
"Investigators uncovered several other factors that prove that
(the suspects) committed this crime," the office was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The suspects' identities were not disclosed. But Interfax
quoted sources as saying that two people were directly involved in
the attack on Gukasian.
</P>
<P>
Gukasian's car was fired at in Stepanokert, Nagorno-Karabakh,
earlier this week.  Gukasian, his driver and bodyguard were
wounded. Gukasian was transported to the Armenian capital of
Yerevan and operated on there. His life is currently out of
danger.
</P>
<P>
Police in Karabakh Thursday arrested "numerous people"
suspected of involvement in the assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
The arrests came after Wednesday's detention of former
Karabakh defense minister Samvel Babaian and some of his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
Babaian was dismissed last December due to a stand-off with
the Gukasian-led government, which accused Babaian of "defending
personal and clan interests, of resorting to all manner of methods
including provocation aimed at derailing the president's course
and demanding his resignation."
</P>
<P>
Nagorno-Karabakh is an ethnic Armenian-populated enclave
inside Azerbaijan. The two countries have been at odds over the
status of Karabakh after a war between 1988 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> HK to Abandon Paper Trade Declarations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Customs and Excise
Department of Hong Kong Sunday reminded importers and exporters
that the Hong Kong Collection Office for collecting paper import
and export declarations will close on April 15.
</P>
<P>
"This is the final phase for the government's three-year
program to migrate all import and export declarations from paper
to electronic lodgment," a spokesman for the department said.
</P>
<P>
From April 1 onwards, import and export declarations with
shipments effected on or after April 1 will need to be made
electronically and no paper declarations will be accepted.
</P>
<P>
However, for declarations with shipments date on or before
March 31, traders can still submit their paper declarations to
Hong Kong Collection Office from April 1 to 14.
</P>
<P>
"To avoid any inconvenience, importers and exporters are
recommended to switch to electronic lodgment as soon as possible,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Using the authorized service provided by the Tradelink
Electronic Commerce Ltd, importers and exporters could lodge their
declarations to the government directly from their office's
personal computer from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that for those companies which are not yet
ready to move to direct electronic lodgment, Tradelink has set up
27 service centers in Hong Kong to help importers and exporters
convert paper declarations to electronic format.

HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 80 buses running through
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) have been
posted with a message on protecting children to mark the 10th
anniversary of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child.
</P>
<P>
The buses plying different routes are now all decorated with an

<P>
The Convention, adopted by the United Nations in 1989,

<HEADLINE> Arab League Officials to Attend Somali Peace Conference </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid announced on Sunday that the league will send a high
level delegation to a conference on ways of realizing peace in
Somalia, due to be held in Djibouti on April 15-20.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid urged the Somali factions to cooperate during the
conference for the implementation of a Djibouti initiative, which
calls for national reconciliation and a national authority in
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The peace plan proposed by Djiboutian President Ismail Omar
Guelleh in 1999 calls on the Somali warlords to disarm, turn their
factions into political parties, and to submit to the authority of
a formal legal system. The plan is aimed at undermining the power
of the warlords who have been the major impediments to achieving
peace and national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid also urged the seven-member committee of the Arab
League to continue cooperation with various Somali parties and
international and regional organizations concerned for supporting
positive developments in Somalia and help the Somalis achieve
reconciliation and national unity.
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising Algeria, Djibouti, Egypt, Libya,
Sudan, Tunisia and Yemen, is entrusted with following up the somali
situation.
</P>
<P>
Also Sunday, Abdallah Hassan Mahmud, Somali ambassador to Egypt
and permanent delegate to the Arab League, was quoted by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency as saying that the Djibouti conference, in
which 60 representatives of the Somali factions will take part, is
to discuss the situation in Somalia in light of the Djibouti
initiative.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at preparing for a proposed conference to
be held later in April with the participation of 460 people
representing the Somali civil society, Mahmud said.
</P>
<P>
Somalia has been in division since 1991 when former President
Siad Barre was toppled.

WASHINGTON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Ending a week-long visit to a region he has described as the
most dangerous in the world, President Bill Clinton flew to
Pakistan Saturday under extraordinary security and urged the
government to restore democracy, reduce its nuclear arsenal, fight
terrorism and find a peaceful solution to the Kashmir crisis with
India.
</P>
<P>
-- After eight years of false starts, negotiation breakdowns
and inch-by-inch progress, President Clinton may be looking at his
last best chance to make peace between Israel and Syria when he
sits down Sunday in Geneva with Syrian President Hafez Assad for
their first substantive face-to-face meeting since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- Vladimir V. Putin, the acting president and the man who many
Russians believe has the muscle to restore order in the country,
holds a commanding lead in polls as the country votes for
president Saturday.
</P>
<P>
-- Despite unusually public pleas by the Clinton administration
for relief from high oil prices, there were few signs of support
for a big increase in oil production as ministers from petroleum-
exporting countries arrived in Vienna Saturday for crucial
meetings.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Urges Israel's Pro-peace Party to Stay in Coalition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian National Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat urged Israel's pro-peace Meretz party not to
carry out threats to quit the ruling coalition, the Jerusalem Post
daily reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Arafat met with Meretz party leader and Israeli Education
Minister Yossi Sarid in the West Bank city of Ramallah for more
than 90 minutes late Saturday night, the report quoted a Meretz
statement as saying.
</P>
<P>
Arafat expressed deep concern over the possibility that Meretz
would leave the government within a few days and it could hurt the
peace process, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
In response, Sarid said his party would refrain from doing
anything that will jeopardize peace progress between Israel and its
Arab neighbors, whatever the coalition developments may be in the
coming days.
</P>
<P>
"Meretz is committed absolutely to the peace process and won't
do anything to burden the (peace) process or delay it," the
statement said. Sarid, however, stopped short of making any
concrete promise to Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The unusual Arafat-Sarid meeting followed the recent coalition
crisis involving the left-wing Meretz party and the ultra-orthodox
religious Shas party, which was stirred up by Shas spiritual leader
Rabbi Ovadia Yosef's inflammatory remarks against Sarid.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly end-of-Shabbat sermon carried over local radio by
satellite earlier this month, Yosef compared Sarid to Satan and two
other condemned figures in the Bible.
</P>
<P>
He also stated that like Haman, a Persian minister who according
to the Bible was hanged after an abortive plot to kill all
Israelis, Sarid's name should be wiped out of the world forever
because of his constant attacks on the Orthodox way of life.
</P>
<P>
Although the rabbi later wrote a statement clarifying his stands
by saying that he had no intention of physical violence toward
Sarid, the position failed to satisfy Sarid and his angry party
members, who are asking for a full and clear apology from Yosef.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein had been
called up to examine whether Yosef's remarks contained a clear
element of incitement to violence and whether a police
investigation against the remarks should be launched.
</P>
<P>
Rubinstein said Saturday that he had made up his mind about the
case but he didn't plan to make the decision known until Monday,
hoping Yosef would make further apology for his outburst during the
period.
</P>
<P>
His good wish, however, had been damped by Yosef, who went
further Saturday night to accuse Sarid of "sowing seeds of racist
hatred" during his traditional Torah lecture to his followers in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Not mentioning the name of Haman, the stubborn Shas spiritual
leader this time compared Sarid to an Egyptian Pharaoh who
persecuted the Jews according to the Bible, an analogy in keeping
with next month's Passover, which commemorates the Hebrews'
scriptural liberation from slavery in Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Far from apologizing, Yosef noted he would not take back what he
said previously.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Shas leader, Labor and Social Affairs Minister Eli
Yishai accused Meretz and other left-wing forces of "blatant
racism" in their attacks on religious Jews.
</P>
<P>
Shas had threatened that if Rubinstein finally issued orders to
launch criminal probe against Yosef, it would quit the coalition
and join the anti-Barak forces.
</P>
<P>
Although Meretz's Knesset faction voted Friday to support
Sarid's idea that the party would remain in the coalition for a few
months to help Barak throughout peace talks with Arab countries,
its ministers in the cabinet would resign rather than give in to
Shas' demands.
</P>
<P>
This incident was not the first conflict between the two
parties, who set respectively the opposite end of the political
spectrum in the Knesset (parliament) and in the whole Israeli
political arena.
</P>
<P>
Last December, Shas blamed Sarid for refusing to allocate enough
funds from the Education Ministry to cover Shas' financial deficit
in its ailing educational system, while the education minister
argued that the system management was corrupt and should take
reform measures first.
</P>
<P>
At the last minute before the Knesset's voting of government's
state budget, Prime Minister Ehud Barak forced Sarid to cave in to
nearly all of Shas' budget demands for its educational system. Shas
then withdrew its letter of quitting the coalition.
</P>
<P>
More recently, Shas was angry with Sarid again in the past few
weeks because he continues refusing to hand over the control of the
ultra-orthodox education system to his deputy Meshulam Nahari, who
is a Shas member.
</P>
<P>
Shas also severely blasted Sarid's decision to introduce the
works of Mahmoud Darwish, a controversial Palestinian writers, into
Israel's school curriculum.
</P>
<P>
Some analysts had pointed out that Barak couldn't afford to lose
either side of the conflict in such a critical time when he
desperately needs solidarity in his ruling coalition and Knesset's
majority support for the upcoming peace deals he negotiates with
Syria, the Palestinians and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Shas, the third largest party in the 120-member Knesset with 17
seats, and Meretz, the fourth largest party with 10 seats, are the
largest ruling partners of Barak's One Israel coalition.
</P>
<P>
In case either of them jumped off the boat, the Barak government
would surely lose the simple majority in the Knesset and became
minority.
</P>
<P>
Such a situation would possibly bring an end to the current
administration and lead to an early general election in the near
future, according to these analysts.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Continue Military Aid to Georgia: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Defense Minister Sabahattin
Cakmakoglu, on an official visit to Georgia, said that Ankara will
continue to extend military assistance to Tbilisi within the
framework of the bilateral military cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
The minister made the remarks on Saturday at the opening
ceremony of the Tbilisi Officer's Club, under the auspices of
Georgian President Eduard Shevardnadze, the Anatolia News Agency
reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The club was formed under the initiatives of the Turkish Armed
Forces (TSK), which provide help in training the Georgian officers.
</P>
<P>
Cakmakoglu said Turkey has close relations with its Caucasus
neighbors Azerbaijan and Georgia, for which the best example is the
Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline project that will transport crude oil out
of the Caspian Sea region.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnazde expressed the hope that the assistance of the TSK
to Georgia will continue.
</P>
<P>
Georgian Defense Minister David Tevzadze, who also participated
in the opening ceremony, said his country attributes importance to
Turkey in the military field and appreciated that Turkey continued
to assist Georgia despite the quake disasters it faced.
</P>
<P>
Cakmakoglu and Shevardnadze held talks after the opening
ceremony, during which military relations and a security pact for
the Southern Caucasus, initiated by Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel, were discussed.
</P>
<P>
Shevardnadze said Georgia has been carrying out preparatory
works for the security of the part of the Baku-Ceyhan oil pipeline
which will pass through its territory, hoping that Tbilisi can have
cooperation with Turkey in the future for the security of the
pipelines.
</P>
<P>
He also expected that Turkey can extend necessary support to
Georgia for the protection of Georgia's independence and integrity.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Pilgrims Sacrifice 683,000 Animals During Haj </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A total of 683,000 animals,
mostly sheep, were slaughtered in Saudi Arabia during this year's
Haj season, the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The sacrifices were carried out under a joint project set up by
Saudi government and the Jeddah-based IDB, according to reports
reaching here earlier.
</P>
<P>
Muslims throughout the world celebrate Eid al-Adha, or feast of
sacrifice by slaughtering sheep, cattle and camels at the end of
Haj in memory of Prophet Ibrahim's readiness to sacrifice for God
his son, Ismail before a ram was given by God to take Ismail's
place.
</P>
<P>
A press release issued Sunday by the IDB, which supervised the
implementation of the project, said the frozen animals had been or
would be distributed to the poor and the needy in 27 different
Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
From last Sunday, the third day after Eid al-Adha, shipments by
air, land and sea have been leaving Saudi Arabia for various
Islamic countries.
</P>
<P>
Those who are likely to benefit from the sacrifices are Muslims
in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Azerbaijan, Jordan, Sudan and Chad.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million Muslim pilgrims from around the world
performed the Haj rituals this year in the holy city of Mecca in
Saudi Arabia. Haj is one of the five pillars of Islam and must be
performed at least once by every able Muslim in his or her life.
</P>
<P>
Owing to sufficient preparations and precautions made by the
Saudi government, this year's Haj has ended without security
incidents or epidemics.
</P>
<P>
Tent fires which caused great casualties and material losses
during previous Haj seasons were not reported this time.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt Rules Out Talks in Third Country </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government rejected
Sunday the reported demand of the National Democratic Front (NDF)
to resume peace talks in a third country.
</P>
<P>
Philippine Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado said in a radio
interview that the NDF has no right to make demands because it was
the one that turned its back on the peace process in the first
place.
</P>
<P>
"Before you talk about peace talks done in another country, you
have to make clear first whether you are restarting peace talks.
The problem with that is, it's the NDF that broke away from the
peace talks," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
The NDF abandoned the negotiating table last year to protest
the ratification of the Philippines-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement
(VFA).
</P>
<P>
The VFA paved the way for large-scale military exercises
between the Philippines and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the Philippine government has focused on pursuing
peace talks with rebel groups at the local level.

DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh
Hasina Sunday declared a new war against poverty, expressing her
firm belief in victory of this struggle like that of the War of
Independence.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a grand children and juvenile rally organized by

National Day, the prime minister declared that not a single person
of the country would be left unfed and roofless, and best possible
endeavors would be made to bring smiles on the faces of teeming

Terming poverty as the number one enemy of the nation, Hasina
said her government is pledge-bound to free the country from this
curse through making independence meaningful.

She called upon the children to build themselves as worthy
citizens of the nation attuned to the spirit of the War of
Liberation so that they could courageously face the challenges of
the new century.

<HEADLINE> Manila Rules Out Negotiating With Terrorists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Invoking an existing policy of non-
negotiation with terrorists, Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Sunday the government will continue to go all out against the
extremist group Abu Sayyaf.
</P>
<P>
The president told reporters at the Philippine Military Academy
in the northern city of Baguio that he had given appropriate
instructions to Armed Forces chief of staff Angelo Reyes to hunt
down the terrorists.
</P>
<P>
"I have instructed the chief of staff of the Armed Forces of
the Philippines what to do," he said, even as defense officials
ruled out the possibility of negotiations with the group, at least
at this time.
</P>
<P>
The Abu Sayyaf is blamed for the recent abduction of more than
30 civilians in Basilan province in the southern Philippines early
this week.
</P>
<P>
Secretary Orlando Mercado of the Department of National Defense
said that until the Abu Sayyaf lays down its arms, the chances of
government negotiating with it is nil.
</P>
<P>
"The existing policy is we do not negotiate with terrorist
movements. Any acts of terrorism have to be met with the
appropriate police and military action," Mercado said.
</P>
<P>
He added the Abu Sayyaf's actions cannot be considered as an
instrument of rebellion, saying what it has committed so far are "
acts of terrorism."
</P>
<P>
Mercado stressed that there are mechanisms to secure the safe
release of the hostages.
</P>
<P>
For now, he said, military operations against the Abu Sayyaf
will continue in Basilan and other areas where they are operating.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian Army Intervenes in Clash Near Capital City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian army was called in
Saturday to quell violence in a town near its capital of Abuja,
which had reportedly claimed several people's lives, the Guardian,
a leading Nigerian newspaper, reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The clash was sparked by a long-running dispute over who should
be the Emir, or traditional ruler of Suleja, 48 kilometers from
the capital, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The protesters objected to the reinstatement in January of
Awwal Ibrahim as Emir who had been deposed in 1993.
</P>
<P>
According to local hospital officials, several people died in
the two days of violence during which local youths had set fire to
the government buildings. The authorities imposed a 20-hour
curfew on it.
</P>
<P>
Among the victims, several had been shot dead by the police
when they were attempting to storm the Emir's palace.
</P>
<P>
Local governor and other officials traveled to the town on
Saturday to assess the situation and appeal for calm.
</P>
<P>
Ethnic, religious and communal violence has seemed to be on the
rise recently, which has killed several thousand during the past
half year, said observers.

MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Voting is in full swing in
Chechnya's Nozhai-Yurt district without armed clashes, said First
Deputy Chairman of Russia's Central Electoral Commission (CEC)
Valentin Vlasov on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
During a phone talk, a deputy chairman of the Nozhai-Yurt
district's local electoral commission told Vlasov that the voting
is going on smoothly in the region and no armed clashes have
occurred, according to the Interfax news agency.
</P>
<P>
Observers representing Acting Russian President Vladimir Putin
and Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov are present at the
polling stations.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian Defense Ministry spokesman Anatoly Shatalov
denied the report that Nozhai-Yurt was seized by some 2,000 rebels.
</P>
<P>
Vlasov said the information from Gudermes, where Chechnya's
main voting administration is located, has so far shown that "no
extraordinary situations have been registered in that republic.
The polling is proceeding normally and the situation has remained
in the usual regime."
</P>
<P>
A total of 28 polling stations have been opened in the Nozhai-
Yurt district, he added.

<HEADLINE> Mandelson Warns Hardliners Not to Block Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland Secretary Peter
Mandelson Sunday blamed unionist and republican hardliners for the
deadlock in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson warned he would not allow policing reforms in the
province to be used as political football in the negotiations to
restart a power-sharing executive, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
He said he would be intensifying efforts to find a way out of
the peace process crisis after David Trimble's close victory as
Ulster Unionist leader on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Trimble beat challenger South Belfast MP Martin Smyth with just
56 percent of the his party's ruling council vote and failed to
defeat a motion linking retention of the Royal Ulster Constabulary
(RUC) title to re-entry into a power-sharing government.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson said the Good Friday Agreement remained "the only
show in town" and while there were many legitimate concerns the
only way to move was forward.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the Ulster Unionist vote on the RUC,
reforms of the police force would still being going ahead. "I
don't think anyone wants to align the RUC with any political party.
That would be wrong."
</P>
<P>
He added his aim was transform the RUC into a community-based
force which would work with both sides of the community.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin has said his party could
still work with the Ulster Unionists, but he said the best way of
supporting Trimble was by restoring the suspended institutions.
</P>
<P>
Mandelson is expected to try to organize meetings between the
Ulster Unionist Party and Sinn Fein this week but most observers
say Trimble's negotiating room has been severely curtailed by the
hardening of his party's line.

<HEADLINE> Russian Troops Battling Chechen Rebels in Nozhai-Yurt: Interfax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- An operation is under way against
the rebels who infiltrated into the village of Tsentroi in
Chechnya's Nozhai-Yurt district, the Interfax news agency quoted a
presidential aide as saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some of the leaders of illegal bandit formations are now in
Tsentroi, some 10 kilometers north of Nozhai-Yurt, Kremlin
spokesman for Chechnya Sergei Yastrzhembsky said.
</P>
<P>
However, Yastrzhembsky denied earlier reports that about 2,000
rebels had captured the town of Nozhai-Yurt.
</P>
<P>
Presidential elections are under way in Nozhai-Yurt, as in
many other Chechen districts, he said. As of 2 p.m. Moscow time (
1000 GMT), 44 percent of the local electorate had already voted in
the district, he said.
</P>
<P>
Chechen Election Commission Secretary Tatiana Pashko was also
quoted as saying that voting was conducted "according to plan,
without excesses."
</P>
<P>
"Neither emergency situations nor militant attacks were
registered in the Chechen district of Nozhai-Yurt," Pashko said.
</P>
<P>
However, a significant number of rebels have concentrated near
the village of Tsentroi, the news agency quoted military sources
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Anywhere from a few hundred to 3,000 people" have gathered
there, they said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, small groups of rebels have infiltrated into the
town of Nozhai-Yurt and passed themselves off as peaceful
residents, they said. These rebels have not been active yet.
</P>
<P>
"No intensive military actions have been taken to eliminate
these bandit formations. The federal troops are building up
forces in the Nozhai-Yurt district. Steps are being taken to block
it," they said.
</P>
<P>
"Up to 2,000 paratroops were deployed to assigned positions.
Combat and army aviation have been actively working there and
collecting intelligence from the air," the sources was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> Truancy Link to UK Youth Crime: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 26 (Xinhua) -- British children who do not attend
school are far more likely to commit criminal offenses, according
to a survey released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly three quarters of excluded students admitted offending
in the previous 12 months, the survey by the Youth Justice Board
found.
</P>
<P>
Not only do truants offend far more, the nature of their crimes
is much more serious, according to the survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted on 132 children aged 14 to 18, showed the
most common offenses were fare dodging on buses, tubes or trains,
vandalism and shoplifting.
</P>
<P>
But more than half of the youngsters said they had carried a
weapon and a similar number admitted they had bought drugs for
their own use.
</P>
<P>
Only 43 percent of excluded pupils thought it was always wrong
to carry a knife and only 59 percent thought it was always wrong
to burgle a house.
</P>
<P>
More than two-thirds admitted drinking alcohol at least once a
month, compared with only 38 percent of regular school attenders.
</P>
<P>
More than six out of 10 of the excluded pupils admitted using
cannabis and 17 percent said they had tried cocaine or crack.
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that the fathers of more than 60 percent
of excluded pupils were not in full time employment.
</P>
<P>
The British government has set local education authorities the
target of reducing exclusions and truancy from schools by 33
percent by 2002.
</P>
<P>
But teachers' leaders claim the targets would make it
impossible to maintain discipline.

<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that the candidates must stand firmly in
line with the Iraqi leadership under President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting with foreign parliamentary delegations as well as
local and foreign media here, Ibrahim said that the voters will
elect "in a free, sincere way."
</P>
<P>
"The Iraqi people's choices will be true and free," he said,
claiming that "deep-rooted democracy" is practised in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim promised the foreign delegations that they will be
given "full freedom to investigate deeply and precisely at all the
election centers."
</P>
<P>
"We hope that you will have a wide, comprehensive viewing of the
elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
Parliamentary delegations from Jordan, Egypt, India, Sri Lanka,
France, Belgium and some other Asian, African and European
countries will observe the elections at the invitations of the
Iraqi government.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has also invited the United States in this connection, but
was turned down, Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
Besides the ruling Arab Baath Socialist Party, whose candidates
comprise 27.5 percent of all the candidates nominated for the
elections, many other parties, including the National Progressive
Front, will take part in the elections, said Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
As head of the disciplinary committee supervising the elections,
Ibrahim said there will be 45,000 supervisors nationwide to oversee
the elections.
</P>
<P>
However, elections will not be held in the three northern
provinces where the Kurds live. "This is because they are under the
direct control of the U.S.. People there have no say, no freedom,"
Ibrahim said.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has virtually lost control of the northern Kurds-
populated areas since the 1991 Gulf war which stopped its
occupation of Kuwait. The U.S. and its Western allies set up two
no-fly zones in northern and southern Iraq allegedly to protect the
Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
persecution.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi election laws require that all parliamentary candidates
must defend the constitution and believe in the principles of the
July 17 Revolution of 1958 which established the republic.
</P>
<P>
During the elections on March 27, some 8.5 million eligible
voters will go to 1,574 polling stations to cast their votes. A
total of 512 candidates, including 25 women, will run for 250 seats
in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
Counting of votes will begin immediately after the voting ends,
said Ibrahim.
</P>
<P>
Four parliamentary elections have been organized in Iraq, the
last in March, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Revolutionary Command Council is the supreme organ of state
power which has the authority to dissolve the parliament and issue
laws. The council is headed by President Hussein.

<HEADLINE> Nearly 10,000 Children, Elderly Die Last Month: Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 9,989 Iraqi children and
elderly people died last month due to the crippling sanctions
imposed on Iraq since 1990, Iraq's health ministry said in a report
released on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report said that 6,939 children, under the age of five, and
3,050 elderly people died from various curable diseases.
</P>
<P>
The high death rate was in sharp contrast with February 1989,
when only 356 children and 479 elderly people died, the report
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
This has brought to the number of mortality to 1,290,543, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that such a high mortality was a direct result
of malnutrition and medical shortages caused by the decade-long
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly called on the U.N. to lift the trade
embargo, and has long accused the U.S. and British delegates at the
U.N. Sanctions Committee of impeding the implementation of the U.N.
oil-for-food deal by deliberately blocking the approval of its
contracts for purchasing humanitarian goods.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Health Minister Umid Medhat Mubarak has condemned the
conduct by the U.S. and Britain as " a war of genocide against the
entire population of Iraq and all peace-loving nations."
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food deal, Iraq is allowed to sell a limited
amount of oil every six months and use part of the revenues in
escrow of the U.N. to buy humanitarian supplies such as food,
medicine for its people who have been hardest-hit by the sanctions.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 25 (Xinhua) -- The new Fastskin neck-to ankle
bodysuit help Michael Klim set a new record at the Commonwealth
100 meters freestyle on Sunday at the Sydney Olympic aquatic
center.
</P>
<P>
Klim broke his own Commonwealth mark of 48.73 seconds, clocking
48.72 seconds in a heat at the New South Wales Institute of Sports
meet.
</P>
<P>
He became the second Australian swimmer to test the Speedo-
designed Fastskin in race conditions over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Grant Hackett, world champion at 1,500 meters freestyle, wore
the Fastkin at a meet Saturday on the Gold Coast, in Queensland
state, when he beat dual Olympic gold medalist Keiren Perkins in
the 400 meters.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Olympic Committee has applied for a test case in
the Court of Arbitration for Sport to determine the legality of
the bodysuits, due to concern about the effect of the suits on a
swimmer's performance.
</P>
<P>
FINA, the international swimming federation, has sanctioned the
swimsuits and has refused to participate in the CAS process
because it gave approval for the Speedo suits before they were
launched last week.

<HEADLINE> PLA Joins Local People on HK Tree Planting Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Five hundred officers and
soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) Garrison in
Hong Kong went to Tai Lam Country Park Sunday to plant trees on
the Third Tree Planting Day of the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR).
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that the PLA garrison in the HKSAR
participated in the annual event which falls on the fourth Sunday
of March.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony marking the event, five trees of Bauhinia, the
city flower of Hong Kong, were planted by honorable guests
including Xiong Ziren, commander and political commissar of the
PLA Garrison; Tung Chee Hwa, the Hong Kong SAR chief executive;
and Ma Yuzhen, commissioner of the Office of the Commissioner of
the Chinese Foreign Ministry in the HKSAR.
</P>
<P>
About 1,500 Hong Kong citizens, many of them children and
seniors, joined the Forces in the event.
</P>
<P>
Tse Lik Ching, who volunteered in the work of the Tree Planting
Day Committee, praised the PLA's participation in the event.
</P>
<P>
"PLA's participation helps boost the influence of the greening
campaign to draw more people's involvement and is conducive to
making the event a long-term practice," said Tse.
</P>
<P>
She said the Tree Planting Day, an event launched after Hong
Kong's return to the motherland, is a good opportunity to promote
communication between the garrison and the local people.
</P>
<P>
"We want to do something beneficial for Hong Kong, which had
not been done by the British colonial administration," Tse said.
</P>
<P>
More than 700,000 trees were planted last year in Hong Kong,
according to Tung Chiu Hung Ping, chairman of the committee and
wife of the chief executive.
</P>
<P>
Mrs. Tung appealed to the Hong Kong citizens to make
contributions to greening Hong Kong to improve the living
environment and build Hong Kong into a model city of greening in
Asia.

<HEADLINE> Kuwaitis May Join Arab Team to Visit Iraq on POWs Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Kuwaitis may join an Arab
delegation to visit Iraq on May 1 to seek the release of Kuwaiti
nationals allegedly still held in Iraq, it was reported here
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Association of the Families of Kuwaiti Prisoners of War
(AFPOWs) will decide whether Kuwait will participate or not,
following a visit to Kuwait by Mohammed Saleh Al-Malkawi, chairman
of Jordan's popular committee supporting families of Kuwaiti POWs,
said local Arabic daily Al-Rai Al-Aam published Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Al-Malkawi, who was invited by AFPOWs' board of directors, is
expected to arrive here next week to discuss forming the proposed
Arab delegation to be formed under the umbrella of the Arab League,
AFPOWs' Deputy Chairman Abdullah Al-Fajji told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Al-Malkawi will brief the Kuwaitis on the latest developments
concerning the POWs issue, Al-Fajji said.
</P>
<P>
But he emphasized that his association will only join the
delegation after several conditions are met.
</P>
<P>
The conditions, he said, are that there will be no media
coverage during the visit and no prisons will be visited, there
will be an Iraqi approval in advance to discuss the fate of the
POWs and the discussions are to be held with an effective (Iraqi)
figure.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fajji asserted that the expected visit is not political and
will not affect any international resolution related to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The initiative to form an Arab delegation under the Arab
League's umbrella was first raised two months ago in a letter the
Jordanian committee sent to the Kuwaiti association.
</P>
<P>
Al-Fajji said the Jordanians had informed the Kuwaiti side that
the visit will be only one day without media coverage, and the
discussions will be held with Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait insists that Iraq is still holding more than 600 Kuwaiti
and third country nationals caught by Iraqi troops after Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
As Baghdad denied the Kuwaiti claim, the POWs issue remains to
be the major block to a thaw of ties between the two Arab foes.

<HEADLINE> Putin Vows to Use All Possible Means Against Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russian Acting President Vladimir
Putin on Sunday vowed to use all possible means to fight against
rebel forces in the breakaway republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on why the military operation in Chechnya was not
over before Sunday's presidential elections, Putin said: "The
bandits do not want to lay down their arms, nor do they want to
take the advantage of the amnesty offered by parliament."
</P>
<P>
"We shall apply all forces and means available to us against
those who offer resistance," Putin told reporters when casting his
ballot at a polling station in Gagarinsky, Moscow.
</P>
<P>
Putin said he has not confirmed reports about the rebel capture
of the Nozhai-Yurt district center in Chechnya. "No such
information is available. We have received reports about the
movement of rebels, not about any seizure."
</P>
<P>
He said the fact that voting is held in Chechnya itself is
important.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for us to ensure that Chechnya takes part in
the voting. The voting itself is even more important than the
choice."
</P>
<P>
"This is important for Chechnya, important for Russia. The
winner will know that he is trusted by the people. And the people
will know that they have elected someone who will take
responsibility for them," said Putin.
</P>
<P>
Putin owes part of his popularity to the war in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"There is every reason to assume that we will shortly be able
to announce that the elections have been held in Chechnya," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Putin launched a massive anti-terrorist military campaign in
Chechnya in August last year following Chechen separatists invaded
neighboring Russian republic of Dagestan and allegedly authored a
series of apartment blasts in Moscow and two other cities that
killed at least 300 people.
</P>
<P>
Putin, a runaway favorite in the elections, however, declined
to comment on his own chances of victory in the first round.
</P>
<P>
"I would not comment on this. Opponents must be respected," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm voting for the future of Russia. In an election struggle
one must always be confident in success."
</P>
<P>
Putin said he will spend the rest of the day outside Moscow. "I
will go the banya (Russian sauna) to take steam with birch twigs,"
he said, adding that he will visit his campaign staff later to
learn about the election results. "I will go to bed earlier today
because I have a great deal of work to do tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Putin is widely expected to win the elections. However, at
stake is whether he will claim victory in the first round by
winning over 50 percent of the vote or have to face a run-off in a
second round.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's electoral law, a second round of voting will be
held in three weeks' time if none of the candidates wins more than
50 percent of the vote in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Other major contenders in the elections include Communist Party
leader Gennady Zyuganov, Yabloko leader Grigory Yavlinsky and
ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader of the Liberal
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls in the run-up to the elections, none
of them posed any real challenge to Putin.
</P>
<P>
Preliminary results are expected to pour on Sunday night Moscow
time and up to 90 percent of the ballots would have been counted
by 9-10 a.m. Monday (0500-0600 GMT).

<HEADLINE> Gorbachev Sees Russia Rising Under New President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev said on Sunday that he thinks Russia will "rise" again
regardless of who becomes its next president.
</P>
<P>
"Independent of whoever wins, Russia is gathering its strength
to get back on its feet. It is already rising," Interfax quoted
the former Soviet leader as saying at a polling station after
voting.
</P>
<P>
He said he traveled a great deal around the country as the
leader of the Social Democratic Party, meeting with people and
seeing "how many new faces have appeared."
</P>
<P>
"It's good the elections have taken place and everyone will
make his own choice," Gorbachev said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's First Deputy Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov, a
protege of Acting President Vladimir Putin, said he thinks the
results of Sunday's presidential elections will help the nation
understand the problems facing it and consolidate its efforts in
solving them.
</P>
<P>
Kasyanov told reporters at a polling station after voting that
Russia still faces quite real economic problems. The new president
and government will have to concentrate their efforts on promoting
the positive trends registered in the country's economy since the
end of last year.

5.1 billion pesos (127.5 million U.S. dollars) of investments in
the country's special economic zones during the first two months
of this year, a 39.7 percent increase over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
The Presidential Palace said Sunday in a statement that higher
investments in these zones during the January 1-March 8 period is
an apparent indication of the growing investor confidence in the
country's economy.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Department of Trade and Industry said export
enterprises in the zones would implement projects worth 4.2
billion pesos (105 million dollars), compared with last year's 2.
88 billion pesos (72 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, utilities enterprises and economic zone
developers will be investing 524 million pesos (13.1 million
dollars) and 449 million pesos (11.2 million dollars),
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The latest investments in the country's economic zones only
reinforced forecasts made by various local and foreign groups that
the Philippine economy is in for a strong rebound this year, said
the statement.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Finance has said the country's economic
situation remains fundamentally sound and prospects are positive.
</P>
<P>
The country's gross domestic product grew by 3.2 percent in
1999, much higher than the previous year's 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Other positive indicators include increasing exports, single-
digit interest rates and a low-level inflation rate, said the
statement.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Denies Government's Order on Farm Invasions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe
has refuted allegations that the government ordered the
countrywide invasion of white-owned commercial farms by war
veterans and land-hungry villagers.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the CNN broadcast throughout the world
Saturday night, Mugabe said: "We did not order the war veterans to
occupy the land. They did it entirely on their own but we can talk
to them and we can advise them."
</P>
<P>
He said the issue of land was not only of concern to the war
veterans. " It is our concern together, the people of this
country, the party and government," he said.
</P>
<P>
The government could not forcibly remove the war veterans from
the occupied farms because its hands were tied by the High Court
judgment, which ordered the executive not to be involved in the
evictions, the president said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that any attempts to remove the war veterans from
the commercial farms without involving the executive would bring
chaos. The issue of land will eventually have to be solved and
that will have to involve every concerned party.
</P>
<P>
"We have to settle it together and we will settle it together.
I don't think that there will be that chaos that you are talking
about," said Mugabe in response to a question on whether the farm
invasions had resulted in chaos.
</P>
<P>
However, he said an attempt to get the war veterans off the
commercial farms as ordered by Justice Garwe in a recent High
Court judgment without involving the executive would bring chaos.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the judgment for having ordered the police to
remove war veterans from the commercial farms without involving
the executive.
</P>
<P>
The police act on instructions from the executive and it was
difficult to see how they would carry this order without involving
the executive. The war veterans would resist police action if the
executive was not involved, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The international community need not fear that there would be
chaos. What would bring chaos is an attempt to implement the
decision of the court without the executive, without us ordering
the forces or if the forces are allowed to get onto the land
occupied by the war veterans and try to use the power that they
have," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally that would be very chaotic and it would be resisted
by the war veterans anyway. If the executive has no role to play
as the court has ruled then obviously there would be chaos in the
country," said the president, adding that there would be order
soon.
</P>
<P>
Turning to the land resettlement program, he said the
government did not want to take away all the land from the
whites.
</P>
<P>
The government had only indicated that it would take way half
the land, which is six million hectares out of the 12 million
hectares held by the whites.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. President Bill Clinton and Syrian President Hafez al-
Assad are to meet in Geneva Sunday afternoon for what is called a
last ditch effort to get the peace process between Israel and Syria
back on track.
</P>
<P>
Although predictions of what is to come out of the meeting vary,
the most prevalent belief is that a renewal of talks, stalled since
January, will be announced.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders are to begin their meeting at the
Intercontinental Hotel.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Jerusalem's top Muslim leader said Saturday that the figure
that 6 million Jews were killed in the Holocaust is exaggerated and
is used by Israel to gain international support.
</P>
<P>
"It's not my fault if Hitler hated the Jews, they hate them just
about everywhere," Jerusalem Mufti Sheikh Ikrema was quoted by the
Italian newspaper La Repubblica as saying.
</P>
<P>
In response, Israel's Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert said that such
expressions by the mufti were "not new to Israeli ears."
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Lily Sharon, the wife of the opposition Likud party chairman
Ariel Sharon, passed away Saturday at the age of 63 after a year-
long struggle against lung cancer.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ehud Barak and his wife Nava expressed their deep
sorrow and wished the family comfort at this time. Lily was an "
outstanding figure and loved by the Israeli public," said Barak,
describing her as a "role model" for many people.
</P>
<P>
Likud's Knesset (Parliament) faction leader Reuven Rivlin said
that he believed Sharon would continue to lead the party and that,
in the case of early elections, Sharon would be a leading
candidate.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- When Clinton meets al-Assad in Geneva Sunday, they are
unlikely to discuss bilateral ties or possible U.S. aid for
Damascus to accompany a Syrian-Israeli peace deal, a U.S. State
Department sources said.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. has not ruled out some sort of financial
assistance to Syria, officials in Washington say chances are very
slim that the U.S.-funded part of a package will include any
military aid.
</P>
<P>
The United States, which will be asked to fork up billions of
dollars to Israel to compensate for a Golan withdrawal, is
expecting the Europeans, the Japanese and Saudi Arabia to foot the
bulk of the Syrian bill.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Govt to Continue Patrols in Mindanao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government said
Sunday that government troops will continue to conduct patrols in
Mindanao to protect residents from harassment by Moro Islamic
Liberation Front (MILF) guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Alexander Aguirre made this clear
following reports that government troops engaged the MILF in some
encounters earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
"Our military will continue the patrols. That is their mandate,
" Aguirre said in a radio interview.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the MILF to stop harassing innocent civilians,
especially as it is in the midst of peace efforts with the
government.
</P>
<P>
Recent reports said government soldiers killed at least nine
more Muslim rebels on Thursday as sporadic clashes continued in
the southern Philippines following major battles last week.
</P>
<P>
All these encounters, Aguirre said, took place during routine
military patrols.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Philippine President Joseph Estrada said peace
remained on top of the administration's agenda for Mindanao, which
he wants transformed into the country's new food basket.
</P>
<P>
He also said the military operations in the area were not meant
to harass the people, but to defend them from abuses committed by
armed rebel groups.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has been fighting for an independent state in Mindanao
island for the last two decades.

<HEADLINE> Zambia to Import 10,000 Tons of Sugar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Zambia is to import about 10,000
tons of sugar from Zimbabwe to forestall a looming shortage
nationwide, Sunday Times of Zambia newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The shortfall is believed to have come about after Zambia Sugar
Company clinched an export quota of about 13,000 tons of sugar to
the European Union (EU) market in mid 1999, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It quoted the company's marketing services manager Marsha Moyo
as saying the importation was meant to satisfy local market.
</P>
<P>
He said the company had installed machinery at the mill capable
of producing 205,000 tons of sugar per season, adding that this
would adequately cater for the EU quota.
</P>
<P>
The sugar has been flowing into the country by road in trucks
for the past three weeks, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Minister of the Commerce, Trade and Industry Jazzman
Chikwakwa said he was concerned about the development as Zambia
had always been self- sufficient in sugar production and believed
such an importation of the commodity was a setback.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Ex-President's Retirement Confirmed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Former Zambian President Kenneth
Kaunda's family is certain that the president's retirement from
active politics is final, Zambian Sunday Mail newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a South African Broadcasting Corporation report
that his father has retired from politics, Waza Kaunda, the son of
Kaunda, said that the news was true and there would be no turning
back on the decision this time around.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to confirm that we, as a family, have welcomed
the old man' s decision to retire from active politics. The
announcement on South African radio is true. We are very happy and
this is the last time he is retiring," the paper quoted Waza as
saying.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Kaunda, leader of the opposition United
National Independence Party (UNIP), is retiring from active
politics. He first retired soon after losing the presidency in
1991, but he returned to active politics two years later. He said
last October that he would kick off the 2001 presidential election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Kaunda's resignation, UNIP Chairman Malimba
Masheke said: " Kaunda's retirement is a very good development for
the party. I welcome the developments with happiness. I always
felt that the old man was not going to contest because time had
come for him to go."

<HEADLINE> Over 1,200 Tanzanians Killed for Beliefs in Witchcraft </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,200 people were
brutally killed throughout Tanzania between 1994 and 1998 for
being associated with witchcraft beliefs, the Sunday Observer
newspaper reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a survey report issued recently by the
Community Development and Humanitarian Association, a newly formed
non-governmental organization, as saying that a total of 1,233
Tanzanians became victims of witchcraft practices in the four
years.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total victims, almost 25 percent or 399 were from
Tanzania's north Shinyanga Region. And more than 1,000 of the
victims, or about 90 percent of those killed were women, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Old women in Tanzania's rural areas are frequently branded as
witches, and killed or abandoned by local communities, because of
their red eyes, which are caused by cooking in poorly ventilated
houses.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the widespread of beliefs in
witchcraft has had significant effects on the social-economic
standards and health related issues.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows the witchcraft followers spend 10-times of
resources in terms of material wealth, money, time and energy in
either counteracting or enlisting the forces of charm in the
region than taking the challenges of development seriously.
</P>
<P>
Because of deep-rooted beliefs in witchcraft and fatalism, the
report said, a lot of people hesitate to work hard for fear of
being seen as accumulating wealth and becoming targets of
witchcraft or attracting witchcraft.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- About 2,000 rebels have seized the
district center of the Chechen town of Nozhai-Yurt, not far from
Chechnya's administrative border with Dagestan, the Interfax news
agency quoted the federal military authorities in Chechnya as
saying on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rebel move was made when the presidential elections were
going on across Russia.
</P>
<P>
"An operation to encircle the rebels is underway. Large federal
units are being drawn to the place," Interfax quoted a source in
the headquarters of the combined federal grouping as saying.

The rebels have been moving into the Nozhai-Yurt district in
small groups for the past few days. They announced Saturday
evening that the district center was in their hands, the
headquarters said.
</P>
<P>
In the northeast, Nozhai-Yurt is protected by the Yamansu River,
which throws up additional obstacles before the forces engaged in
surrounding the rebels, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
"For this reason the troops need to be supported by troops
specialized in mountain combat," the military said, adding that
airborne forces may be required for this operation.
</P>
<P>
The rebels based in Nozhai-Yurt are under the command of
warlord Khattab, the headquarters said.

<HEADLINE> East China City Introduces Foreign Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The city of Qufu, birthplace of
Confucius in east China's Shandong Province, has been introducing
foreign talents to help develop its local economy.
</P>
<P>
Relevant statistics show that 133 foreign experts have so far
been invited to work in the small city.
</P>
<P>
Foreign talents have added an accumulated sum of 220 million
yuan (26.5 million US dollars) in the city's output value, sources
said.
</P>
<P>
A case in point is the Japanese fruit experts who were invited
to Qufu, where they helped train more than 7,500 local farmers. As
a result, the city's combined output of high-quality fruit rose by
40 percent over the days when the city did not have any help of
foreign experts years ago.

<HEADLINE> Drinking Water No Longer Salty, but Sweet in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The drinking water for four
million residents of this north China port city is no longer
bitter and salty but up to the national standard and among the
best in the country's big cities.
</P>
<P>
 Local city officials attributed the change that has taken
place to years of hard efforts made by the municipal government.
The city had suffered from an acute shortage of water from the
late 1970s to the early 1980s, and saline tap water, and the only
solution was to divert water from the Luanhe River in neighboring
Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Tianjin municipal government introduced a ban on
fish farming in reservoirs and along the river, sources of
drinking water for the city's four million residents, and
initiated tough restrictions on industrial projects, fish farming
and tourism in surrounding areas to save water.
</P>
<P>
It also set up water quality monitoring teams in areas around
the sources of water so as to protect it better still and prevent
from pollution.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate Continues to Rise in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- India's inflation rate went up
to 3.5 percent for the week that ended on March 11, the highest in
the last 40 weeks, due to a sharp increase in prices of various
primary articles and imported crude petroleum.
</P>
<P>
According to figures provided by the Reserve Bank of India, the
central bank of India, the 0.76 jump in the annual rate of
inflation to 3.5 percent from 2.74 percent in the previous week
was on account of the escalation in prices of primary articles
brought about by various Railway and General budget proposals.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate, however, was much higher at 5.14 percent
during the corresponding week of last year.

<HEADLINE> India Sees Departures of Nuances in Indo-U.S.Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, March 26 (Xinhua) -- India External Affairs Minister
Jaswant Singh said in an interview published Sunday that there was
a "departure of nuances" in New Delhi-Washington relations as the
United States had realized India's standing in the world.
</P>
<P>
"There is a departure of nuances (in the Indo-U.S. relations...
It is significant," Singh told Star Television Saturday night at
the end of U.S. President Bill Clinton's five-day visit, the first
by a U.S. president in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
According to Singh, there was a reassessment (by the U.S.) of
the whole standing of India, that "India is on the move not only
in terms of South Asia, but the whole Asia."
</P>
<P>
However, the Indian minister refused to make a comparison
between its relations with Washington and its relations with
Russia, its traditional ally.
</P>
<P>
New Delhi has "extremely good" relations with Moscow even after
the collapse of the former Soviet Union, Singh said, adding that
there was even a strategic partnership between India and Russia.
</P>
<P>
On terrorism, Singh said Washington and New Delhi had already
established a joint working group to fight the menace.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with U.S. officials, Singh said, he told
American leaders that terrorism was troubling the U.S. and
directly affecting its interests, and that the scourge could not
be eliminated by an individual country's attention.
</P>
<P>
On the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT) which the U.S. has
urged India to sign and linked it with Washington's lifting of
sanctions imposed after India's nuclear tests in May 1998, Singh
said India's move would be governed by parliament which was "not
yet seized of the matter."

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW Delhi, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister Atal
Bihari Vajpayee was planning to visit the United States in early
September, probably around September 6 and 7, his national
security advisor Brajesh Mishra disclosed in an interview with a
local television Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Indian Express daily reported on Sunday that Vajpayee was
expected to attend the United Nations millennium summit during his
planned visit as Indian prime minister to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Vajpayee accepted Washington's invitation in his talks last
Tuesday with U.S. President Bill Clinton, who just wound up his
five-day state visit to the South Asian country, the first by a U.
S. president in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
On the latest offers by Pakistani chief executive Pervez
Musharraf for talks with India, Mishra told the Zen News Channel
that no dialogue was possible unless Pakistan stops aiding
terrorism in Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
Mishra also said that Clinton supported India's claim for a
permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council during his
talks with Vajpayee.

<HEADLINE> Voter Turnout Exceeds 50 Percent in Russia's Far East Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Voter turnout was over 50 percent
in Primorye region in Russia's Far East by 4 p.m. local time (0100
GMT) on Sunday, Itar-Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Polling stations will be open until 8 p.m. (0500 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Many voters in the region came to polling stations in the
afternoon following a small turnout in the morning, Tass quoted
the local election commission as saying.
</P>
<P>
Voter turnout is crucial for the presidential elections as
Russia's electoral law stipulates that the election would be
invalidated if voter turnout is below 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
Voter apathy has been a matter of concern for Acting President
Vladimir Putin's camp. It is feared that voters may stay away from
polling stations as Putin's approval rating is so high that his
victory seems assured.
</P>
<P>
Recent opinion polls put Putin at the runaway first place with
approval ratings between 50 and 60 percent. Gennady Zyuganov, the
Communist leader, was in a distant second place with about 25
percent.
</P>
<P>
At this hour, Russians in all 11 time zones are casting their
ballots to elect a new head of state to succeed former president
Boris Yeltsin who resigned on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Some 107.9 million voters are expected to choose from 11
candidates a new president. Voters also have an option to vote
against all the candidates.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's new electoral law, a candidate can claim victory
in the first round if he/she wins over 50 percent of the vote.
Otherwise, a second round will be held between the two leading
candidates.
</P>
<P>
Alongside the presidential elections, the State Duma (lower
house of the parliament) deputies will also be elected in eight
one-seat constituencies where the polls were pronounced invalid in
December's parliamentary elections. Seven administrative regions
will choose their leaders and four regions will elect deputies to
legislative assemblies.
</P>
<P>
In Udmurtia Republic, a referendum will be held on amendments
to its constitution in connection with introducing the
presidential post in the republic while Karelia will hold a
referendum on the number of chambers in the local legislature and
on the title of the republic's chief executive.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Casts Ballot, Says Reform Will Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Russia's former president Boris
Yeltsin said Sunday that he believes reforms will continue in
Russia following the election of a new president.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone is waiting for change. Of course, changes will take
place. But the most important thing is that the course of reforms
must be preserved. And it will be preserved, I'm sure," Interfax
quoted Yeltsin as saying after casting his ballot on Sunday
morning.
</P>
<P>
He wished success to the Russian citizens and to the new
president, and said that Russia must continue to move forward. "We
are pinning great hopes on this," he said.
</P>
<P>
The former president, whose resignation on the New Year's Eve
shocked the world, said he is "in good mood and in good health."
</P>
<P>
"I think you can guess for whom I have cast my ballot. But I
don't think I should give his name or talk about him -- just not
to let anyone down," Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin hand-picked Vladimir Putin as prime minister in last
August, and propelled Putin to the Kremlin as acting president
after his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Putin is widely expected to win the election.

<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Communist Party leader and
presidential candidate Gennady Zyuganov predicted that he and
Acting President Vladimir Putin will enter the second round in the
presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
"I think there will be a second round," he told reporters after
casting his ballot Sunday morning at a polling station in Moscow's
Tverskoi District.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's electoral law, a second round of voting will be
held in three weeks if none of the candidates wins over 50 percent
of the votes in the first round.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov urged journalists not to ask him any "provocative"
questions about whether he will be removed from the post of the
Communist Party leader if he is defeated.
</P>
<P>
"You are talking about the resignation of one of the most
authoritative politicians and a State Duma deputy, for whom
millions of people will cast their votes."
</P>
<P>
He said his chances were good.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls in the run-up to the elections put Zyuganov at a
distant second place with approval ratings between 20 and 25
percent. Putin was the undisputed favorite with approval ratings
between 50 and 60 percent.

MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Presidential candidate Grigory
Yavlinsky has urged Russian electorate to cast their ballots to
determine Russia's future.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to tell everyone, do come to polling stations.
Every vote counts," Interfax quoted him as saying after he cast
his ballot at a polling station in Moscow's Krylatskoye District
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"All those who care for the future of our country, all those
who care for what Russia will be like in the next century, must
come and vote."
</P>
<P>
"This is the first voting in the 21st century. Russia's future
depends on it," he said.
</P>
<P>
In answer to the question about what future is in store for
Russia, Yavlinsky said, "Today is the day of St. Gregory, so you
may guess what future is in store for Russia."
</P>
<P>
Like Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov, he also foresees a
second round of voting.

Yavlinsky, a Westernized economist who leads the Yabloko
movement, was put in the third place in opinion polls in the run-

CANBERRA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Olympic flame will travel
underwater on Australia's Great Barrier Reef during the torch
relay later this year, the Sydney Organizing Committee for the
Olympic Games (SOCOG) confirmed Sunday following a successful
trial.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG and Quicksilver Connections, which will transport the
Olympic flame in Australia's Queensland state from Palm Cove to
Agincourt Reef on a catamaran later this year, gave the innovative
torch a trial run last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
SOCOG said Port Douglas marine biologist Wendy Craig Duncan
would carry the torch underwater at Agincourt Reef on June 27,
creating Olympic history.
</P>
<P>
"Carrying the torch underwater at the reef will be like a dream
come true," Ms. Craig Duncan said.
</P>
<P>
It would be the first time the Olympic flame had travelled
underwater on a torch relay, SOCOG said.
</P>

The flare technology that will make the underwater journey
possible has been developed by Melbourne-based company Pains
Wessex Australia.

<HEADLINE> Preparatory Work Begins on West-East Gas Pipeline Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Preparatory work has officially
started on the west-east gas pipeline project, China's second-
largest infrastructure project next to the Three Gorges Dam
Project.
</P>
<P>
At an on-going national conference on this topic that ends here
today, Minister of the State Development Planning Commission (SDPC)
Zeng Peiyan announced the formation of a leading group for the
project, under SDPC Vice-Minister Zhang Guobao.
</P>
<P>
The conference signified the commencement of a drive to develop
the relatively-backward western part of the country.
</P>
<P>
Relevant areas and departments are required to complete the
project's planning and designing work within a year, and launched
construction in the first half of 2001 for the trunk pipeline as
well as for gas utilization facilities, according to conference
sources.
</P>
<P>
Governments at all levels should adopt policies to direct and
channel public investment into the gigantic project, meanwhile
encouraging entrepreneurs from overseas to take part.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 419 billion cubic meters of proven natural
gas reserves in the vast Tarim Basin in northwest China's Xinjiang
Uygur Autonomous Region. Further exploration in the next five
years there might increase this figure to one trillion cu m,
experts say.
</P>
<P>
China boasts an estimated 8.4 trillion cubic meters of natural
gas resources.
</P>
<P>
An estimated approximately 120 billion yuan (14.5 billion U.S.
dollars) will be injected into the first stage of the pipeline
project, which is aimed at restructuring the country's industrial
structure and energy consumption patterns, and at raising economic
efficiency in the provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities
along the pipeline.
</P>
<P>
The people of Xinjiang will greatly benefit from the project,
as it will tap the country's largest natural gas reserves there,
Zeng said.
</P>
<P>
During the first stage of the project, the 4,200-km pipeline is
expected to provide some 12 billion cu m of gas annually for
industrial and domestic use to Shanghai Municipality, Jiangsu,
Anhui, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi and Gansu provinces, and the Ningxia
Hui Autonomous Region.

<HEADLINE> U.N. to Help Rwanda Counter AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations will
provide Rwanda with one-million-U.S. dollar fund this month to
help it set up a national commission to fight against the spread
of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The commission will coordinate the country's national policy
against the epidemic and assist its government's efforts to
develop a social mobilization program, according to a press
release issued by the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Some 400,000 U.S. dollars of the total funding for the program
will support civil society including non-governmental
organizations (NGOs), community-based organizations, testing and
counseling centers to promote the knowledge of the killer disease
and improve the techniques of prevention and examination.
</P>
<P>
It will also support initiatives to sensitize members of the
armed forces. More than 370,000 Rwandans, more than one in every
10 adults, are estimated to be living with HIV, and almost half
the total (about 180,000) have already developed AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Key underlying causes of the epidemic in Rwanda include the
economic crisis, early onset of sexual activity, and resistance to
talking about sex and to the use of condoms.
</P>
<P>
The extent of HIV and AIDS-related illnesses and death in
Africa is seriously depleting the region's human capital.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that the number of active health practitioners
and educators in the most seriously affected countries could be
reduced by more than one-third in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> China's Fast Food Operations Booming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- China's fast food sector,
challenging foreign rivals of McDonald's and Kentucky Fried
Chicken, has witnessed a two-digit growth rate since 1998.
</P>
<P>
Fast food restaurants proliferated in China last year. The
industry's turnover rose by more than 20 percent to 75 billion
yuan (9 billion U.S. dollars), according to the State Internal
Trade Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The turnover of fast food sector now accounts for one third of
that of China's fast-growing food and beverage industry, said
China Daily Business Weekly today.
</P>
<P>
The use of new marketing strategies such as takeaway food
outlets, franchises and food courts have emerged in China over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
"China's fast food restaurant sector grew rapidly last year
despite the fact that food and beverage industry growth slowed,"
said the BW report.
</P>
<P>
With a quicker rhythm of life, people in China appreciate now
lunch on fast foods. And many government and enterprise employees
now lunch on fast foods.
</P>
<P>
The use of fast food restaurants makes it possible for
employees to take more time off compared to traditional family
shops.
</P>
<P>
Fast food restaurants have a huge market potential in China.
</P>
<P>
An official from the State Internal Trade Bureau was quoted as
saying that fast food restaurants should pay more attention to the
nutritional value and flavor of their offerings.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Beijing Youth Daily story underlined that a lack
of standardization is a major drawback in Chinese fast food chain
shops, for example, random pricing a noodle store that draws
customers' ire.

<HEADLINE> February Manufacturing Output Expands in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Singapore's manufacturing
output grew by 9.4 percent year-on-year in February with the
cumulative output increasing by 19.0 percent in the first two
months of this year compared with a year ago, Singapore's Economic
Development Board said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The board attributed the expansion in February to higher growth
in the two of the major clusters-- electronics and engineering.
</P>
<P>
The electronics cluster grew by 32.7 percent compared with the
same period a year ago and the higher output came from all major
segments, especially semiconductors, computer peripherals and
telecommunication equipment.
</P>
<P>
The output of the engineering cluster gained 8.9 percent over
the same month of last year, contributed by a hefty growth in
precision engineering and a moderate growth in process engineering.
</P>
<P>
The chemicals cluster declined by 22.3 percent in February
compared with last February due to lower output in the
pharmaceuticals and petroleum segments.

<HEADLINE> Corruption to Dominate Bangladesh's Donors' Meeting Agenda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Corruption in judiciary and police
service will dominate the discussion at the upcoming Paris meeting
of the Bangladesh development partners to be held on April 13-14,
The Independent newspaper reported here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
High on the agenda of the Paris meeting will be governance,
corruption and poverty alleviation on which donors would appraise
the government's views and progress of reforms now stuck in
different stages.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank is also going to hold a civil society forum
meeting in Dhaka on March 28 to hear the views of the civil
society leaders on major development issues.
</P>
<P>
Sources said three keynote papers will be presented at the
meeting with a focus on poverty alleviation and a strategy to
achieve it. The civil society forum meeting will be the first of
its kind in the country as part of preparations for the Paris
review meeting of the Bangladesh development partners.
</P>
<P>
There are indications that the donors might use the views of
the civil society leaders at the meeting to exert pressure on the
government on important policy issues in areas where they might
have substantive differences with the government delegation.
</P>
<P>
However, a World Bank official ruled out such a possibility at
a meeting recently.

<HEADLINE> Voting Starts in Moscow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Voting started in Moscow to elect
a second Russian president after polling stations opened at 8 a.m.
Moscow time (0400 GMT) Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kamchatka, Chukotka and Koryak regions in the Far East were the
first to kick off the elections. Voting in these regions started
at 10 p.m. Moscow time (1900 GMT) Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the largest country in the world, covers 11 time zones.
The voting day coincides with Russia's transition to summer time.
At 2 a.m. local time, clocks were set one hour forward. Moscow
time is four hours later than GMT instead of three hours.
</P>
<P>
Voters will choose from 11 candidates a new head of state to
succeed former president Boris Yeltsin who resigned on December 31,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Russia's 107.9 million registered voters are expected to cast
their ballots in 94,500 polling stations across the country. In
the breakaway republic of Chechnya where an anti-terrorist
campaign is still under way, 460,000 voters will be able to vote
in 12 of the 15 districts. Some 850,000 Russians working or
traveling abroad will also participate in the elections.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 international observers from more than 50 countries
and some 80 international organizations together with 500,000
Russian observers sent by presidential candidates will be deployed
to monitor the voting and ballot counting processes.
</P>
<P>
Acting President Vladimir Putin is widely expected to win the
election. Recent opinion polls put him at the runaway first place
with approval ratings between 50 and 60 percent. It is hard to
predict, however, whether Putin will win an outright victory in
the first round or have to claim victory in a run-off.
</P>
<P>
According to opinion polls, Communist Party leader Gennady
Zyuganov was in a distant second place with support of about 25
percent. Liberal economist Grigory Yavlinsky was in the third
place, followed by ultra-nationalist Vladimir Zhirinovsky, leader
of the Liberal Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Under Russia's law, a run-off between the two leading
contestants will be held three weeks later if none of the
contenders wins more than 50 percent of the vote in the first
round. If the voter turnout is lower than 50 percent, or the
number of voters who voted against all candidates surpasses the
number of voters who voted for the leading candidate, the election
will be invalidated and a new election will be held within four
months.
</P>
<P>
Results are not allowed to be made public until balloting has
been concluded across the country. Preliminary results are
expected to come on Sunday night Moscow time and by 9-10 a.m.
Monday (0500 GMT-0600 GMT), 90 percent of the ballots would have
been counted.

resigned on December 31, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Chechnya is prepared for the presidential elections and all

officials as saying. Mobile polling stations will be used in the
mountainous populated areas.
</P>
<P>
The nine polling stations in Grozny are ready to receive 27,000
voters, said Interfax.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Prime Minister and Envoy to Chechnya Nikolai
Koshman said that in Chechnya the presidential elections will be

necessary security measures will be taken, Koshman said.

<P>
Elections will be held in 12 of the 15 districts in Chechnya.

<HEADLINE> Thomas Cup a Checkpoint For Olympics, Says Indonesian Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Badminton Association of
Indonesia (PBSI) Vice Chairman Agus Wirahadikusumah said that the
Thomas Cup could be a leverage point for Indonesian male shuttlers
to reach victory in the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"If our shuttlers can retain the Thomas Cup in Kuala Lumpur in
May, I believe their way to reach victory in the Olympics in
Sydney in September is wide open," he was quoted by the Jakarta
Post Sunday as saying.
</P>
<P>
"On the contrary, if we fail in the Thomas Cup, it will be
really difficult to raise athletes' motivation to fight their best
in the Olympics," he added.
</P>
<P>
Agus was optimistic that national shuttlers would be able to
retain the Thomas Cup. However, he was doubtful on the Uber Cup
team's chances in the event in Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
He said PBSI still had time to create a conducive atmosphere
prior to the Thomas and Uber Cups and the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"It's not too late to build unity among shuttlers, coaches and
officials in order to reach our goals. The three parties must
trust each other as it's really important to create synergy in
motivation and fighting spirit," he said.
</P>
<P>
Agus, the 1998 Thomas and Uber Cups team manager, said he
experienced the same situation in 1998, but Indonesia managed to
retain the Thomas Cup thanks to athletes' fighting spirit and good
teamwork.

<HEADLINE> FDI in Bangladesh Continues to Fall in 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment (FDI) in
Bangladesh continued to fall in the current fiscal year (1999-2000)
from its earlier low levels, according to statistics compiled by
the Bangladesh Bank, the Financial Express reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
the central bank's statistical department figures showed that
the estimated amount of FDI would stand at 160 million U.S.
dollars during the current fiscal year, a fall of 38 million
dollars from 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
These figures only reflected the cash flow through banking
channel, but included the investments in the form of cash and
equipment under gas and electricity, the central bank said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investments in Bangladesh's export processing zones (
EPZs) were not included in the figures. But the size of
investments in EPZs since 1998-99 was not significant, according
to official sources.
</P>
<P>
The Board of Investment, however, claimed that government's
investment promotion agency registered foreign direct investment
proposals worth 6.42 billion dollars during last three years up to
1999.
</P>
<P>
The central bank figures also estimated that other investments
using medium- and long-term loans would stand at 398 million
dollars in 1999-2000, up from 277 million dollars in 1998-99.

<HEADLINE> Researchers Call for Speeding up Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A group of brain trustors to
China's State Council have urged to accelerate the pace of
urbanization as a way of hasten national economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"A one percent increase in urbanization annually usually adds
three percentage points to economic growth," Liu Yong, an expert
with the Department of Development Strategy and Regional Economy
under the State Council's Development Research Center, was quoted
by today's China Daily Business Weekly as saying.
</P>
<P>
Liu and his colleagues have been working on the urbanization
topic for nearly two years before they came to a conclusion that
China's economic growth now largely depends on expansion of
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Although the central government has used active fiscal policies
to stimulate domestic demand, it has remained sluggish, and has
become the largest bottleneck to economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Liu cited the low consumption level of rural residents, who
make about 80 percent of China's approximately 1.25 billion
population, as a primary factor affecting sluggish demand.
</P>
<P>
To stimulate demand within this huge population is loaded with
potential, Liu said. But despite decades of rapid growth, surplus
labor and overproduction of some key farm products such as grain
and cotton, have retarded growth in rural incomes and consumption.
</P>
<P>
"Accelerating urbanization could play a decisive role in
stimulating domestic demand," he said, adding that urbanization
helps reduce rural population growth rate while increasing incomes
and consumption rates.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that a 30 percent reduction in the rural
population could along enhance rural per capital incomes by 30
percent in the next 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Urbanization will require a large investment in infrastructural
construction, including water supplies, communications and waste
handling facilities. Undertaking these projects would stimulate
domestic demand and hasten urbanization.
</P>
<P>
"Urbanization would spur the country's inert tertiary sector.
More rural residents would live in more highly urbanized cities
and towns and their living standards would be improved," he said.
</P>
<P>
The tertiary sector, including service industries, accounts for
only 32 percent of China's GDP, compared with 60 percent to 70
percent in the developed countries.
</P>
<P>
The country's sustainable development strategy will
significantly benefit from urbanization, Liu said.

Technology Import and Export Corporation (CATIC) has seen a new
wave of exports represented by Egypt's purchase of 80 K-8 aircraft
made in China.
</P>
<P>
CATIC, a major foreign trade company under China Aviation
Industry Corporation II, has accepted a contract with the Egyptian
Defense Department for the purchase of the two-seat trainer
aircraft and a production line worth 347.4 million U.S. dollars at
the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
"The contract is significant, because Egypt is the dragon head
of the Arab countries," Wu Fanghui of the Hongdu Aviation Industry
Group, which produces the aircraft, according to today's Business
Weekly published by China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Hongdu sources noted that buyers in several Arab countries have
already expressed a strong interest in the K-8, as have other
buyers in Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Hongdu was expected to sign some contracts in coming
months.
</P>
<P>
The K-8 is designed for training missions such as takeoffs,
landing, acrobatics, night and spin flights and armament training.
It has been exported to several countries, including Pakistan,
Myanmar and Zambia.
</P>
<P>
Hongdu promised to maintain close contact with the K-8 users to
ensure quality post-sale services, and to make it a best seller.
An automated production line is planned to be put into use.
</P>
<P>
Hongdu plans to issue A shares to raise about 500 million yuan
(about 60.2 million U.S. dollars) to upgrade its technologies and
to develop new aircraft models within this year.
</P>
<P>
Hongdu, founded in 1951 and previously known as the State-run
Hongdu Machine-building Factory, later the Nanchang Aircraft
Manufacturing Company, is a strong enterprise under the China
Aviation Industry Corporation II.

<HEADLINE> Bank Support Helps China's Shipbuilder Bounce Back </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Policy-oriented financial aid has
played a crucial role in helping China's shipbuilding industry
recover from the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The policy-oriented preference from the Export-Import Bank of
China (Eximbank) "played a critical part" in winning orders for
China's shipbuilders and helped them out of trouble, Eximbank
President Yang Zilin was quoted as saying by today's China Daily
Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The Eximbank signed its largest lending deal, worth 370 million
U.S. dollars, with the China Shipbuilding Industry Corporation and
China Shipbuilding Trading Company Ltd. to finance the export of
five giant oil tankers to Iran, earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
China ranked the third in the ship exports in the world in 1999.
Regional financial turmoil, which erupted in 1997, pummeled the
world's shipbuilding industry and caused an abrupt fall in ship
prices on the international market, creating unprecedented
problems for China's shipbuilders.
</P>
<P>
Eximbank, since its establishment in 1994, had approved expert
seller's credits worth 29 billion yuan (3.5 billion U.S. dollars)
to finance ship exports and has provided export insurance worth
176 million U.S. dollars, according to the bank's statistics.
</P>
<P>
The share of loans went to the shipbuilding industry soared to
32 percent of the Eximbank's total lending last year. The loans
have supported exports of 480 ships rated at a total of 11.5
million tons, to countries including the United States, Germany,
Singapore and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Financial services have helped China's shipbuilders reduce
production costs, improve technological levels and market profits,
said Yang.
</P>
<P>
The shipbuilding business, on the other hand, has helped
alleviate pressures of unemployment and has helped strengthen
social stability.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that for every 10,000 tons of ships produced, 5,
000 jobs are created in the industry and more than related 50
sectors such as in the metallurgical, chemical and light
industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Using a mix of financial instruments such as export credits,
export credit insurance and foreign exchange guarantees, the
Eximbank has provided 148 million U.S. dollars of guarantees for
syndicated foreign loans made in connection with a giant ship
export contract, and helped exporters reduce borrowing costs.
</P>
<P>
A vigorous shipbuilding industry has resulted in the issuance
of more purchase orders at home, and Yang promised to provide
stronger, streamlined financial support for the shipbuilders so
that they can compete in the international market.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Wants Reduced Dependence on U.S. Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Abdurrahman
Wahid said he wanted to reduce Indonesia's dependence on arms
procurement from the United States or any single foreign country,
the Jakarta Post reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Wahid said such dependence not only created a great financial
burden but also hurt the country's security interests.
</P>
<P>
"They (the United States) also need us. Without us, security in
this region is not guaranteed," he was quoted by the Jakarta Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Indonesia's dependence on America is evident in the planes
being used by AURI (Air Force) squadrons... Who do they think
Indonesia is? If they really do not consider us as important then
why should we bother with American F-16s when we could always buy
(French) Mirages or (Russian) Migs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Talking to 1,200 soldiers of the Air Force's Special Troops at
its headquarters in Bandung, about 180 kilometers southeast of
Jakarta on Saturday, the president said Indonesia should learn
from China and India in their success in developing their own
military industries.
</P>
<P>
He said China's People's Liberation Army had become a
formidable force because they refused to become dependent on
another party. India had likewise developed its defense industry
to the extent that it was now able to make Mig-23 fighters with a
license from Russia.
</P>
<P>
"I have thought for a long time about reducing our acquiescence
to the U.S. and depending more on our own capability," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said Indonesia already had at least three state companies
producing military equipment.
</P>
<P>
"We are a great nation and we must have our own military
industry," he added.
</P>
<P>
While diplomatic relations between Indonesia and the United
States remain on good terms, military relations have continued to
deteriorate in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In May 1997 Indonesia canceled a plan to buy nine F-16s after
the sale was blocked by a U.S. Congress critical of Indonesia's
human rights record.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia then opted to look into purchasing Russia-built
fighter planes. However the plan was suspended due to the
financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In September 1999 the Clinton administration imposed a ban on U.
S. support of the Indonesian Military after the eruption of
violence following the August 30 ballot in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
Wahid indicated that he had turned down U.S. President Bill
Clinton's offer of lifting the ban during their meeting in
Washington in November last year.
</P>
<P>
According to him, with enough money Indonesia could easily buy
military equipment, including jet fighters from other countries
such as France and Russia.
</P>
<P>
"They (the U.S.) do not simply want to help us, they want to
sell (their products) to us," the president added.
</P>
<P>
The vanguard of Indonesia's airforce consists primarily of
about two dozen British-made Hawk fighters, a few F-16s and
several aging F-5s.

counterpart Nawaz Sharif, the Lahore Declaration which called for
peaceful dialogue on Kashmir and other issues.
</P>

However, the dialogue process was interrupted by the Kargil
conflicts in the following summer when intense military actions
were taken on the Line of Control in Kashmir by both sides. (

short jumper gave them a 56-53 lead with 2:47 to play. But the
Boilermakers of Purdue missed several 3-point attempts and
Wisconsin went 8-of-11 from the foul line in the final 1:25.
</P>
<P>
Carson Cunningham drilled an off-balance 3-pointer with 11.5
seconds remaining to bring the Boilermakers within 63-60. But Mike
Kelley made the first of two free throws with 10.6 seconds to play,
sealing the victory.

Midwest's top seed, or second-seeded Iowa State at the RCA Dome in
Indianapolis next Saturday.

<P>
Purdue (24-10) was trying to become the first school since
Duke in 1994 to participate in a Final Four in its home state.But
the Boilermakers allowed Jon Bryant to make five 3-pointers
overall and managed just eight points in the final 5:23.
</P>
<P>
The Badgers are the lowest-seeded team to reach the Final Four
since No. 11 Louisiana State in 1986 and the first eighth seed
since Villanova won the national championship in 1985.

<HEADLINE> Web-based Job Markets Emerging in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Increasing Internet usage has
given rise to numerous web-based job markets in China, which are
expected to be unified into a national market in the foreseeable
future.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that a total of 151 such job markets have been
set up since 1995, when the first web-based job market was
initiated in Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
Web-based job markets provide comprehensive information for
both job-seekers and talent-seekers. Job-seekers may submit their
personal information to be filed in an Internet talent bank, with
categories according to specialization.
</P>
<P>
Experts say that web-based job markets have huge potential in
China, due to the convenient, instant, and user-friendly services
they provide and the possibility they promise of forming a unified
national job market.
</P>
<P>
The prospects for such a market, however, are bright, given the
great importance the Ministry of Personnel attaches to it.

<HEADLINE> Overseas Investors' Profits in Tianjin up 330 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investors in this north
China port city have reported a 330 percent increase in profits
and a 18.9 percent growth in sales revenue for the first two
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics from the Tianjin Municipal Government,
profits earned by overseas investors in January and February
totaled 871 million yuan (105 million US dollars), a rise of 330
percent over the same period of last year, with sales revenues of
15.9 billion yuan (19.2 billion US dollars), up 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the three-digit increase in profits to the
low profit base and the fact that many overseas-funded firms have
begun to enter a period of returns after losses in the initial
stage of investment.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin is home to more than 10,000 overseas-funded firms,
ranking first among the cities in north China, including such
multinationals as Motorola, Otis, Smithkline and French
Laboratories Ltd, NEC, Epson, Samsung and LG.
</P>
<P>
With its sales revenues reaching one billion yuan (120 million
US dollars) last year, lift manufacturer Otis (Tianjin) has earned
an accumulated profit of 2.73 billion yuan (330 million US dollars)
during the past two decades.
</P>
<P>
The value of net assets owned by the Otis is now 100 times more
than the initial investment made by their Chinese and overseas
partners.
</P>
<P>
Printer producer Epson (Tianjin) reported a rise of 29 percent
in total sales revenue, reaching 330 million yuan (40 million US
dollars) last year, while Samsung earned a profit of 900 million
US dollars in 1999, compared with a loss of one million US dollars
in the previous year.

<HEADLINE> Steel Giant Resumes Full Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 26 (Xinhua) -- The Baoshan Steel Company in
Shanghai, one of China's leading steel complexes, announced that
its first iron-making system, which had suspended operation
because of a fire on February 28, has resumed all-round production
at the normal level.
</P>
<P>
The second converter began operation Friday for the first time
since production was halted on February 28; the second converter
resumed operation on March 8.
</P>
<P>
According to production practice, usually only two of the
three converters in a system are in operation simultaneously;
therefore, the resumption of the first and second converters means
a full recovery of the system's producing capacity.
</P>
<P>
An investigation has found out that the fire was caused by a
wiring fault under the third converter.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the plant said the profit for this year should
be 15 percent more than last year's 1.5 billion yuan (182 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The first converter produces 8,880 tons of steel each day.
</P>
<P>
The company has pledged that the interests of clients both at
home and abroad will be guaranteed, all contracts will be carried
out on time and goods delivered as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
It has been learned that since the fire, Baoshan has upgraded
its systems which produce hot-rolled and cold-rolled steel, steel
tubes and high-speed steel.

<HEADLINE> Brazil to Repay Huge Debts in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Brazil will have to repay
3.392 billion dollars of foreign debts in April this year, the
Interamerican Express Bank said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Of the debts due in April, 1.236 billion dollars will be repaid
by the private sector with the rest by the public sector, the
bank's Department of Economy said.
</P>
<P>
"The Brazilian government has already obtained funds in advance
in the international market and is ready to face the drastic drop
in the country's foreign exchange reserves next month," said
Marcelo Allain, chief economist of the Brazilian Bank.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that Brazil's foreign debts due in the first two
months this year were 1.3 billion dollars and 680 million dollars
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The considerable drop in the country's foreign exchange
reserves may affect the exchange rate of the real, the Brazilian
currency, against the U.S. dollar in the last week of April, and
the subsequent devaluation of the real will damage the country's
exports this year, according to local economists.

on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Bayern, who twice fought back from one goal down, kept top
spot on goal difference.
</P>
<P>
Second-placed Bayer Leverkusen also picked up only one point
by drawing 1-1 with SC Freiburg.
</P>
<P>
Kaiserslautern's goals came from French attacking midfielder
Youri Djorkaeff in the 20th minute and striker Marco Reich 10
minutes later. Elber levelled from close range just 90 seconds
after Djorkaeff scored and scored his second from outside the
penalty area in the 61st minute.
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen, who had recorded a club record 9-1 win over SSV
Ulm last weekend, were far less inspired against a brave Freiburg
side.
</P>
<P>
The visitors opened the scoring through Georgian midfielder
Levan Kobiaschwili after just three minutes.
</P>
<P>
Leverkusen then wasted numerous opportunities, failing to
surprise Freiburg's excellent 'keeper Richard Golz until Brazilian
playmaker Emerson equalised in the 53rd minute.
</P>
<P>
Germany striker Ulf Kirsten narrowly missed a goal which would
had lifted Leverkusen to the top of the table in the closing
stages. His header from a perfect Thomas Brdaric cross flew just
wide.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Report on Proposing OPEC Output Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Iranian Oil Ministry on Sunday
denied a report that Iran had proposed to raise the output ceiling
of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a statement that the reported hike in OPEC
output was not the policy of the Iranian Oil Ministry, the Islamic
Republic News Agency (IRNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous official from Iranian Oil Ministry was quoted by
Reuters on Saturday as saying that Iran expected OPEC to boost the
output ceiling by between 700,000 barrels and 1 million barrels per
day in a bid to drive down the surging oil prices on the world
markets.
</P>
<P>
The official also predicted that OPEC members, in their meeting
in Vienna on Monday, would possibly agree to the above-mentioned
range of output increase and no more than that was expected.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, IRNA also said that President Mohammad Khatami on
Sunday held phone talks with Saudi crown prince, Libyan leader and
Venezuelan president on oil issues ahead of the OPEC ministerial
meeting. But no details of the talks were disclosed.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that OPEC will boost oil supplies from
April 1 after the expiration of the year-long supply cuts which
have trebled oil prices, under strong international pressure,
mainly from big oil consumers such as the United States.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the second largest producer after Saudi Arabia within the
oil cartel, has strongly resisted a hefty output increase sought by
the United States, fearing that it may cause the collapse of the
prices.
</P>
<P>
Iran suffered an economic slump last year mainly due to the low
prices of oil, the country's main foreign currency earner.

<HEADLINE> Assad, Clinton Fail to Reach Accord on Resuming Syria-Israel Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
and U.S. President Bill Clinton have failed to reach agreement on
the resumption of Syria-Israel peace negotiations suspended in
January.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters at a news
briefing here Sunday evening at the end of the summit that
differences between Syrian and Israel were too great to warrant
the immediate resumption of talks.
</P>
<P>
He said that the U.S. had a better understanding of Syria's
positions following the useful and serious meeting and urged Syria
and Israel to narrow their differences as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held their first talks since 1994 at Geneva's
Hotel Intercontinental under tight security. Also present were
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara and U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of the meeting, U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy
Berger said it was unlikely that the two leaders would announce an
immediate renewal of the negotiations, which have been stalled
since January.
</P>
<P>
He said he expected Assad would return to Damascus for
consultations, and that Clinton would talk to Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
The talks broke off in January after Syria demanded that Israel
commit itself to returning the entire Golan Heights before other
issues could be discussed. But despite the official deadlock,
there has been growing evidence that talks are continuing behind
the scenes, and that a deal could be close.
</P>
<P>
Switzerland has emphasized that it is willing to host further
summit meetings, and there are indications that Clinton and Assad
may have been discussing preparations for another meeting in
Geneva, perhaps also attended by Israel and Lebanon, in a matter
of weeks.
</P>
<P>
Berger said one of the main challenges was to increase
confidence between Israel and Syria so that both sides are
prepared to compromise to secure a peace deal.
</P>
<P>
"They both have to compromise but they both have to believe
that they are stronger and better positioned as a result of
reaching a peace agreement," he said.

<HEADLINE> S.African President Meets Acting Rwandan President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 26 (Xinhua) -- South African President
Thabo Mbeki held talks with acting Rwandan President Paul Kagame
in Pretoria to discuss the situation in the Great Lake Region,
Mbeki's office confirmed on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Presidential spokeswoman Tasneem Carrim said the meeting lasted
for about an hour on Saturday in Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
"It was a confidential discussion, and I cannot divulge any
details," she said.
</P>
<P>
Government sources were earlier quoted as saying that Mbeki
initiated the talks to seek Kagame's support for the peace process
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).
</P>
<P>
Mbeki reportedly needed such a commitment to be able to
reassure DRC President Laurent Kabila that he would not be alone
if he adhered to the Lusaka peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda has been backing one of the main rebel groups fighting
to oust Kabila.
</P>
<P>
Kagame was at the weekend confirmed as acting president
following the resignation of President Pasteur Bizimungu last
week.
</P>
<P>
Kabila is expected to hold talks with Mbeki within the next
week or two. He requested the meeting during a visit by Foreign
Minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma to the DRC last week.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka peace accord, signed last year by all the parties
involved in the DRC conflict, provided for a ceasefire, a
withdrawal of foreign troops, and a series of steps leading to
democratic elections.
</P>
<P>
But clashes between DRC troops and rebel forces have been
continuing in the past months.
</P>
<P>
Kabila last month voiced strong suspicions about South
Africa's role in the conflict, and accused the country of selling
arms to the African countries supporting the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Dlamani-Zuma last week again denied this allegation in her
talks with Kabila in Lubumbashi, DRC, and reiterated that South
Africa was acting as an honest peace broker.
</P>
<P>
On her return, she reported that much had been achieved to
clear the air between South Africa and the DRC.
</P>
<P>
The upcoming talks between Mbeki and Kabila would continue the
progress that had been made, she said.

<HEADLINE> Rail Strikes Causes Chaos in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 26 (Xinhua) -- A 24-hour strike by rail workers in
Italy ended Sunday evening, having wreaked havoc on rail services
across the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike began Saturday at 9:00 p.m. and was called by five
independent rail union organizations to protest clauses in the
national contract signed and sealed by the State Railways (FS) and
the big three union confederations, and other problems in the
sector including safety concerns.
</P>
<P>
According to the FS, only 31 percent of train drivers took part
in the strike and 44 percent of trains were running as normal,
although it admitted that services in the northeast in particular,
along the Milan-Bologna line and the Adriatic coast, suffered
severe disruption.
</P>
<P>
In Milan and Rome, trains were at a complete standstill, while
at the railway station in Naples, frustration among travelers was
such that scuffles broke out at information and ticket points.
</P>
<P>
The strike followed Friday's four-hour wildcat walkout by
flight controllers, which forced the cancellation of hundreds of
domestic and international flights and grounded an estimated 150,
000 furious passengers at Milan and Rome airports.
