<HEADLINE> African Trade Ministers Endorse Algiers Declaration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALGIERS, September 23 (Xinhua) -- Winding up their second
ordinary session here Friday, the African trade ministers endorsed
the Algiers Declaration on the upcoming multi-lateral talks with
the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
The document ensures a common African position for the first
time in the third WTO ministerial meeting, to be held in Seattle,
the United States between November 30 and December 3, 1999, the
Algerian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The African ministers highlighted in the document the
importance of working out a "balanced agenda" for the WTO meeting
that could take into account the interests of all the African
countries and concerns of the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
They called for rectifying the imbalances resulting from the
Uruguay Round and meeting the funding and trade needs of the
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The coming talks of the WTO should seek to promote a regulatory
order that ensures equal sharing of benefits and special treatment
of developing and underdeveloped economies, the declaration said.
</P>
<P>
The talks should also deal with the African economic problems
in the crucial areas such as agriculture, services, and health.
</P>
<P>
The talks should develop an international trade order that
could support the ongoing economic reforms in the African
countries, the declaration added.
</P>
<P>
It underlined the necessity of extending the WTO interim period
for the intellectual property rights (IPR) and other customs,
trade and investment measures to redress the economic difficulties
effectively.
</P>
<P>
The document also urged for adding more low- and mid-income
African countries to the list of countries enjoying compensations
and favorable treatment.
</P>
<P>
On the WTO membership, the African ministers called for
simplifying and easing the measures and controls imposed on
applicant countries.

<HEADLINE> Iraq on "Humanitarian Intervention" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The so-called
"humanitarian intervention"implies an organized onslaught on the
most fundamental rules of the present international order, such as
sovereignty and political independence, Iraq said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Iraqi Minister of Foreign Affairs Said
Al-Sahaf said the basis of the onslaught was that the said
principles cannot be constitute a protective shield to the grave
violation of human rights, and consequently, intervention, even
with the use of force, should be allowed, in order to protect
those rights.
</P>
<P>
No one should be deceived by this doctrine as being the frame
of the modern picture of colonialism with the logic of power as
its base, Said Al-Sahaf said.
</P>
<P>
"Before anything else, we should realize that there is no
situation in relation to which this doctrine is thrusted which is
free from the external political interference which led to its
existence, and accordingly, it could not be claimed that the
international responsibility for the situation rests exclusively
on the targetted government, " he said.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, we should also realize that the purpose and
the principles of the Charter of the United Nations and the
mechanisms of the organization are not devoid of modalities to
deal with any situation of the type advanced to justify the
doctrine," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it is not unjustified to consider the role of the United
Nations as marginalized after it has become subject to the views
of the controlling powers in international relations and their
selfish interests regardless of what the Charter provides in terms
of rights and duties and procedures, we are convinced that the
doctrine of humanitarian intervention represents a dangerous
destructive tool to all the gains that have been achieved through
joint efforts in favor of the general international interest as
evidenced by the record of this Organization," the Foreign
Minister added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cloud over Next Zambian Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Both Zambia's opposition and
ruling parties expressed their concerns over who will contest for
the coming presidential elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
It is still uncertain whether Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba and its former President Kenneth Kaunda will be rivals in
the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, head of the Zambia's opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), said his party has no objection to
President Chiluba to stand for a third term if he is adopted by
his Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Basil Kabwe, administrative secretary of the UNIP, said, "we
would like to see him (Chiluba) stand so that we can have a
rematch between Dr. Kaunda and Mr. Chiluba."
</P>
<P>
In return, the ruling MMD has also given Kaunda a green light
to the political arena by saying that it would not stop Kaunda
from contesting for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
MMD National Secretary Michael Sata said: "There equally should
not be any trouble if the MMD field Chiluba for the polls."
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem whom UNIP fields because it's not our
business to stop other parties from putting up candidates of their
choice," Sata said.
</P>
<P>
All political parties are free to choose their presidential
candidates and field them without any problems from other parties,
Sata added.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda ruled the country from its independence in 1964 until
1991, when he was defeated by Chiluba in the multi-party elections
of that year.
</P>
<P>
He was barred from running for the presidency in the elections
held in 1996 because constitutional amendments adopted that year
do not allow those with foreign parentage and those who have
already served two terms of the presidency to stand for elections
any more.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, born of Malawian parents, and his party have been
opposed to the constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
The opposition urged the ruling MMD to remove the clauses in
the constitution to allow the two leaders to contest in the next
elections.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba has repeatedly stated that he will not
violate the constitution that limits a president to two five-year
terms but recently some MMD officials, especially MMD youth wing,
urged Chiluba to run for a third term and called for a
constitutional amendment to allow Chiluba to do so.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked if he is considering running for the third
term, the president said: "I'm not saying that leaders must not
stay too long but they must justify why they want to stay longer,"
describing the calls for his third term as democracy.
</P>
<P>
Recently some MMD officials, especially MMD youth wing, urged
Chiluba to run and called for a constitutional amendment to allow
him for a third term.
</P>
<P>
MMD youth on the Copperbelt Province held a rally, demanding
Chiluba to stay on, describing him as "a national asset".
</P>
<P>
Copperbelt Province youth Chairman Josiah Mutisa said that
"President Chiluba is a national asset who cannot be allowed to
retire just like that. The MMD and the constitution are not enough
to warrant his departure."
</P>
<P>
The chairman said his members will soon petition other
provinces for a national youth conference so that the idea of
floating President Chiluba in the 2001 elections can be tabled.
</P>
<P>
Copperbelt Deputy Minister Mathew Mulanda said the MMD
leadership is in full support of the youths because there are a
number of things not yet accomplished by Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
On Monday MMD youths in Lusaka Province joined their colleagues
in other provinces calling on Chiluba to stand for another term of
office.  They urged the government to amend the constitution
so as to allow Chiluba to contest the presidency again.
</P>
<P>
Provincial youth chairman Stephen Bwalya said at the gathering
that "the economic situation in our country needs a person of the
current president's calibre for it to forge ahead."
</P>
<P>
Sonny Mulenga, MMD chairman of the Lusaka Province told the
gathering that there is nothing wrong with changing the
constitution as long as the majority of the people favor the
proposed amendments.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga, who is also Lusaka Province Deputy Minister, said that
it has been difficult to find a successor and that Chiluba's
achievements have attracted international support.
</P>
<P>
But chief government spokesman, Information Minister Newstead
Zimba said early this month that the government is not going to
amend the constitution to suit any political party or particular
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda accused early this month Chiluba of being behind "the
growing mild campaign for his third term in office".
</P>
<P>
The UPND and National Citizens Coalition (NCC) are opposed to
the calls for Chiluba's third term of office.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Officials Expect Kosovo Independence: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Senior U.S. officials have
privately dropped their opposition to Kosovo's independence from
Yugoslavia and say the Clinton administration increasingly sees
the province's secession as inevitable, a leading U.S. newspaper
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post reported from Pristina, Yugoslavia, that
officials say the emerging consensus, which amounts to a major
shift for the U.S., is already having a significant impact on the
international peacekeeping operation in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The report came one day after NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana said the independence of Kosovo is unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
"The United States has become a leading advocate for the
creation of independent institutions and legal structures that
tend to isolate the fledging United Nations protectorate from
Yugoslavia's manifold economic problems and political troubles,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. officials deny that the administration's
approach is meant to engineer the further breakup of Yugoslavia,
as the Belgrade government claims.
</P>
<P>
The officials added that sovereignty issues should not be
allowed to stand in the way of Kosvo's progress because it will
likely gain its independence anyway.
</P>
<P>
"Nobody in Washington expects this not happen," said a U.S.
official who spoke on condition he not be identified. "Our
attitude before the war was, it's better if it doesn't happen.
Now, we know it's clearly on the way...It's the mostly unspoken
assumption" of all U.S. policy makers.
</P>
<P>
But the newspaper continues to say that Washington declared
that the administration has not altered its policy. The U.S. is
opposed to the independence of Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"We support the creation of democratic institutions and a
market economy, and that's the focus of our effort," said a White
House spokesman.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman James Rubin said, "We have always
said we do not support independence for Kosovo, and we do not
support independence for Kosovo now."
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Solana, NATO's top diplomat said that the goal of
Kosovo's ethnic Albanians to gain independence from Yugoslavia is
unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
Solana told a group of American defense reporters that ethnic
Albanians must abandon hope of gaining independence from
Yugoslavia in order to achieve a lasting peace in the divided Serb
province.
</P>
<P>
If the international community allows a shifting of borders in
southern Serbia, it will be hard to stop a momentum toward
political fragmentation elsewhere in the Balkans and perhaps even
in the vast territories of Russia.

<HEADLINE> Floods Force to Evacuate 100,000 Hondurans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran government
Friday ordered the evacuation of more than 100,000 residents of
the north and center of the country because of the overflow of
several rivers in those sectors.
</P>
<P>
The Contingences Permanent Committee (Copeco) ordered the
controlled discharge of the Francisco Morazan hidroelectric plant
reservoir in the center of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Copeco said that the water reservoir threatens to overflow
after reaching its top capacity of 288.5 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
This situation has forced also the dislodgement of the
residents of that sector to prevent the dangers of discharge.
</P>
<P>
The Electric Energy National Company of Honduras warned Friday
morning that energy will be rationed because of the interruption
of the central turbines during the discharge.
</P>
<P>
Honduras is being lashed by rains that have caused eight
deaths, 4,675 victims, thousands of stranded people, the partial
or total destruction of 650 houses, and flooded some 1,000
hectares of banana, sugarcane and basic grains.

WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Defense Secretary William
Cohen will start his Asia-Pacific trip next week to Indonesia,
Australia, Thailand, Singapore and the Philippines, the Pentagon
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. officials said Cohen will make his first stop in
Australia, where he will visit the embarkation point for a
peacekeeping force to East Timor in Darwin Wednesday. A great part
of 200 U.S. peacekeeping force are now stationed at the Australian
port.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Cohen will be in Jakarta where he will meet with
Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie and military leader Gen.
Wiranto as well as political opposition leaders.
</P>
<P>
"In Jakarta, the secretary will press for military reforms as
well as continuing movement toward fair and democratic elections,"
one senior Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
Cohen has no plan to visit East Timor, but the U.S. officials

WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State

<HEADLINE> African Development Forum to Be Held in Addis Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The African Development
Forum '99 is due to be held in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa from
October 24 to 28, the United Nations Economic Commission for
Africa (ECA) announced here Friday.
</P>
<P>
The ECA-sponsored forum, which meets annually on different
development issues, is an initiative to position an African-driven
development agenda that reflects consensus among major partners
and leads to specific programs for implementation.
</P>
<P>
The theme of this year's forum is "The Challenge to Africa of
Globalization and the Information Age."
</P>
<P>
Because of the importance of defining African strategies to
engage with the global information economy, this topic has been
chosen for the inaugural African Development Forum, an ECA press
release said.
</P>
<P>
Organizers told reporters that the aim of the forthcoming forum
is to present the key stakeholders in African development with the
results of current research and opinion on key development issues
in order to formulate shared goals and priorities, draft action
programs and define the environment that will enable African
countries to implement these programs.
</P>
<P>
The forum is expected to result in the adoption of country
action plans for the utilization of information and communication
technologies to accelerate social and economic growth, and
recommendations regarding the impact on Africa of globalization
and the information age.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the forum, ECA will organize a post-forum summit
dialog convening selected heads of state and government to ensure
their full support for the country action plans, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
State leaders and government ministers from all African
countries have been invited to attend the five-day meeting.

<HEADLINE> China Backs Angola's Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China is willing to develop
the fraternal relations with Angola and supports the efforts of
the Angolan people to restore peace and stability in the country,
Chinese Ambassador in Angola said here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Yuande made the statement in an interview with the
official newspaper Jornal de Angola on the eve of a grand banquet
in honor of the 50th anniversary of the People's Republic of
China, hailing the "fraternal" Sino-Angolan relations and the
existence of good cooperation and traditional friendship between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that the visit by the Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos to China last year has promoted the bilateral relations
and laid solid foundation for the development of the cooperation
and friendship in the coming 21th century.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said China hopes the war could end as soon as
possible and China will continue to help the Angolan people
reconstruct their homeland.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said that China has been abiding by the
decisions made by the United Nations and the U.N. sanctions
imposed on the Angola's rebel National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
He said that the Chinese contact with UNITA and other movements
in Angola, established at the suggestion of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU) during the fight against the Portuguese
colonists, has been ended since the former colony gained
independence from Portugal.
</P>
<P>
As for the humanitarian aid for Angola, Jiang said that in
October, dozens of containers of humanitarian goods offered by
China, including rice, soy and daily necessities, worth more than
600,000 U.S. dollars, will arrive in Angola.
</P>
<P>
China has also provided with an interest-free loan of 11
million U.S. dollars in a housing program for the displaced
Angolan people, which has been started in Viana, a satellite city
of Luanda. In 1999, the Chinese Red Cross provided the Angolan
ministry of social assistance with 20,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
A program on the construction of a modernized 100-bed hospital
in the capital city is under consideration, according to the
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
As for the development of the Chinese economy, Jiang said that
due to the efficient leadership of the Chinese Communist Party,
Chinese economic construction has entered upon a new phase at the
turn of century.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Appreciates Egypt's Support in Health Field </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Iraqi minister of health on
Friday expressed appreciation for Egypt's support for his country,
especially in the health domain.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has supplied Iraq with medicines and medical equipment it
needed urgently, under the Iraq-United Nations oil-for-food
program, Omed Medhat Mubarak told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks before leaving Cairo for home after
attending the two-day 46th session of the regional office of the
World Health Organization, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has been under economic sanctions imposed by the U.N. in
1990 after its invasion of Kuwait. It was allowed to export
limited amount of oil to buy food and medicine under a
oil-for-food deal with the U.N..
</P>
<P>
During his stay in Cairo, the Iraqi minister discussed with his
Egyptian counterpart Ismail Sallam steps to implement the joint
minutes agreed upon in Iraq last year.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has responded positively to Iraq's demands for more
medicines and medical equipment for its hospitals, the Iraqi
minister added.
</P>
<P>
He said Sallam agreed to send an Egyptian medical team soon to
Iraq to operate on patients for heart diseases, he said.
</P>
<P>
The English-language Egyptian Gazette newspaper reported
recently that Egypt will sign with Iraq a deal on the export of 15
million Egyptian pounds (4.41 million U.S. dollars) worth of
medicines and medical equipment.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has sold to Iraq medicines and medical equipment worth
100 million pounds (29.41 million dollars) since the end of 1996
when the oil-for-food program began to be implemented.
</P>
<P>
It has also set up a permanent center for Egyptian medications
in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad help meet the needs of the Iraqi
people.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus to Receive TOR-M1 Missile Systems: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus' National Guard will
in the coming days be receiving an unspecified number of TOR-M1
missile systems, coming from the 21 ordered by Greece from Moscow,
local media reported on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the National Guard's tank arsenal was likely
to be reinforced both by the American-made M48A5 MOLF and by the
well-known Russian-made T-80.
</P>
<P>
The reports also said the National Guard will be buying from
Russian an additional 43 BMP-3 armored vehicles, two 155 mm
artillery batteries, and 12 long-range multiple rocket launching
systems.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island in the wake of a failed coup seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus had planned to buy S-300 missiles from Russia to cement
its air defense capability. But following intense international
pressure and war threats from Turkey, President Glafcos Clerides
had to decide to divert the surface-to-air missiles to Greece's
Crete island last December.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government has since been striving to find
alternatives to shore up its air-defense umbrella.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus' Defense Minister Socrates Hasikos Thursday ordered an
investigation into leaks to the media about the impending
arrivals of new hi-tech weapons systems for the National Guard.
</P>
<P>
A press release of Cyprus' Defense Ministry said the decision
to investigate the matter is in no way aimed at press freedom;
Rather it adheres to the ministry's policy of protecting important
information vital to national security and defense.

ABU DHABI -- A new condensate refinery with an investment of
320 million U.S. dollars has started exports of processed
downstream hydrocarbons to global markets, the Dubai-based Gulf
News daily reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Enoc Processing Co. LLC, located at Dubai's Jebel Ali Free
Zone, is 100 percent owned by the United Arab Emirates National
Oil Co. (Enoc). It is designed to produce 120,000 barrels per day
of diesel oil, fuel, jet fuel, naphtha and liquefied petroleum
gas, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"The refinery is producing to its full capacity and we have
started exports mainly to buyers in the Far East and other places
globally," Hussain Sultan, Enoc chief executive officer, was
quoted as saying. He did not specify the volume of exports.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- There could be a sizable demand for computer
peripherals, especially printers, in the Middle East markets
during the last quarter of 1999 and in the first two months of
2000, said the Gulf News daily on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The region's information technology industry forecasts a 20-25
percent growth during the period over the comparable one last
year, industry sources were quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Part of the growth is related to the Y2K compliance issue, but
companies and organizations are also upgrading their peripherals
to match the advances made to their computer systems, they said.
</P>
<P>
According to the paper, the Middle East is also facing an
acute shortage of computer components, such as memory chips,
motherboards and even processors, which has caused a sharp gain
in component prices.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The United Arab Emirates continues to be
Thailand's top trade partner in the Middle East, with bilateral
trade last year totaling more than 1.26 billion dollars, and value
in the first seven months of this year reaching 741.7 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Following current trends, the total bilateral trade volume of
1999 is expected to be 5 percent higher than last year, Samroeng
Sampantharak, Middle East director of Thai Trade Center, told Gulf
News on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Thailand sources a major portion of its crude oil needs from
the UAE, with shipments in 1998 totaling 665.5 million dollars,
and those in the first seven months of this year at 367.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil factor has consistently tipped the balance of trade in
the UAE's favor.
</P>
<P>
BEIRUT -- The total assets of Lebanese commercial banks rose to
38.5 billion dollars last month from 34.1 billion dollars in
August 1998, an increase of 12.9 percent, the Daily Star reported

<P>
Bank deposits at the end of August stood at 32.4 billion
dollars, 13 percent higher than August 1998, the paper quoted a
Central Bank's report as saying.
</P>
<P>
Total bank loans to the private sector at the end of August

The aid is the fourth of its kind from the EU to Tunisia,
according to the Tunisia-Africa News Agency.
</P>

The assistance, to be delivered on two stages, will be given
soon after the start of economic reforms that cover the banking
sector and the privatization program in education.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Home Sales Fall for Second Straight Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.S. sales of existing
homes dropped in August for the second straight month after
hitting a record high in June, the National Association of
Realtors said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The association reported that sales of existing single-family
homes fell by 2.8 percent in August to a seasonally adjusted
annual rate of 5.25 million units.
</P>
<P>
Economists said that mortgage rates rising steadily over the
last six months was probably the major factor.
</P>
<P>
The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 7.94
percent in August, up from 7.63 percent in July and 6.92 percent
in August of 1998, the association said, citing figures from
Freddie Mac, the mortgage company.
</P>
<P>
Last month's sales level was the lowest since May when 5
million units were sold. The decline in August followed a 4
percent drop in sales in July. In June, sales hit an all-time high
of 5.63 million units sold.
</P>
<P>
Despite August's decrease, association officials said they
expect existing homes sales to post another record year in 1999.
Last year's record was 4.97 million units.
</P>
<P>
The 5.25 million level of existing home sales in August are
running about 9.2 percent higher than the sales level in August
1998.
</P>
<P>
The association said that the Northeast was the only part of
the country reporting a gain in sales in August. Sales there rose
7.6 percent to an annual rate of 710,000 units.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the national median sales price for existing homes
rose 5.3 percent to a record 137,700 dollars in August over the
same month a year ago, the association said.
</P>
<P>
The association officials attributed the increase in the median
home price to strong demand, a healthy economy and a 29-year-low
unemployment rate.

<HEADLINE> Iran Criticizes Cold War Mentality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran on Friday
criticized the practice of dividing the countries into "coalition
members" and "others" while denying "others" the rights to
development.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly,
Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said "persistence of Cold War
mentality" serves "certain interests".
</P>
<P>
"During this century, exclusion often surfaced as paradigm of
global interaction. It views the world in terms of modes of
loyalty and belonging into +coalition members+ and +others+, and
divides rewards and blames accordingly," the Minister said.
</P>
<P>
He said the mentality reigning in the 20th century has brought
bloodshed and devastation to human society, suppressed many
potentials, wasted much human capabilities and natural resources
and given rise to "domination, autocracy, violence and
confrontation".
</P>
<P>
A dangerous tendency of this approach in the era of
globalization "is the unilateral application of coercive economic
measures and extraterritorial application of domestic legislation
which have been pursued by the United States in spite of unanimous
global opposition," Kharrazi said.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. "has an indispensable pivotal role in shaping the new
world of the next millennium", and its enhancement requires
strengthening General Assembly's role by focusing its agenda on
contemporary challenges facing the world, he added.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Calls for Greater Effort to Curb Illicit  Small Arms Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday adopted a presidential statement, calling upon
Member States to make greater efforts to curb the illicit trade of
small arms in order to safeguard the world peace and security.
</P>
<P>
The statement voiced grave concern of the 15-member Security
Council that "the destabilizing accumulation of small arms has
contributed to the intensity and duration of armed conflicts."
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council is deeply concerned that countries
involved in, emerging from, or close to protracted armed conflicts
are particularly vulnerable to violence resulting from the
indiscriminate use of small arms in armed conflict," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"The easy availability of small arms can be a contributing
factor to undermining peace agreements, complicating
peace-building efforts and impeding political, economic and social
development," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council underlined the vital importance of
effective national regulations and controls on small arms
transfers because of considerable volume in the small arms trade,
said the statement.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council emphasizes that the prevention of illicit
trafficking is of immediate concern in the global search for ways
and means to curb the wrongful use of small arms, including their
use by terrorists," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Security Council emphasizes the importance of regional
cooperation in tackling the issue of illicit trafficking in small
arms," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council also called for measures to discourage
arms flows to countries or regions in or emerging from armed
conflicts, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Small arms were defined as weapons designed for personal use,
such as revolvers, rifles, carbines, sub-machine guns, assault
rifles and light machine guns.
</P>
<P>
A U.N. report said in early August that the world is awash in
more than 500 million small arms and light weapons, the weapons of
choice in many contemporary conflicts.

</P>
<P>
Tunisian Minister of International Cooperation and Foreign
Investment Mohamed Al-Ghannouchi and visiting Chief of the
European Commission Roubar Holystone signed an accord to this

enhance the banking sector and increase national income.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Holystone expressed the EU desire to continue
supporting the economic reforms in Tunisia and ensuring the
success of the EU-Tunisian partnership.
</P>
<P>
The EU-Tunisian Partnership Agreement was put into force in
1998, which envisages that EU will extend financial assistance to
Tunisia to bolster its economic competitiveness and privatization
program.

<HEADLINE> Security Council Holds Open Session on Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday held an open meeting on small arms, which, though
small in size and light in weapons, have created big casualties in
the world today.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan opened the meeting, which is
held at ministerial level at the initiative of the president of
the 15-nation Security Council, Arnold Peter van Walsum of the
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Council meeting, Annan said, "The proliferation
of small arms, ammunition and explosives has also aggravated the
violence associated with terrorism and organized crime."
</P>
<P>
"Even in societies not beset by civil war, the easy
availability of small arms has in many cases contributed to
violence and political instability," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Council met in a closed-door session Thursday in
preparation of the formal meeting.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations said in an early August report that the
world is awash in more than 500 million small arms and light
weapons, the weapon of choice in many contemporary conflicts.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, long focused on nuclear weapons and
conventional disarmament, has become increasingly concerned over
the role of small arms, particularly in internal conflicts and in
the hands of insurgents, criminals and terrorist groups. The world
body plans to hold an international conference on the illicit arms
trade by 2001.

Kennedy said he knew a number of people had been warned about
their safety.
</P>
<P>
"I understand over recent days the police have called on a
number of individuals in Bessbrook warning them that they have
received information that their lives may well be in danger from a
republican group which is allegedly anti-drugs," he said.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the threat was contained in a letter sent to the
Northern Ireland public housing body, the Housing Executive.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA, dismissed the letter
threatening the nine as "mischief-making" at a critical point in
the peace process.
</P>
<P>
DAAD first came to public attention in April 1995, during the
first IRA ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
But the organisation has been relatively inactive since
carrying out a three-year campaign against alleged drug dealers in
which nine men were shot dead.
</P>
<P>
The latest threats followed a number of killings in which
alleged drug dealers were the targets.

<HEADLINE> Scotland to Win Independence by 2007, Says Nationalists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The leader of the
pro-independence Scottish National Party (SNP) predicted on Friday
that Scotland will have gained its independence and broken up
Britain by 2007 -- its 300th birthday.
</P>
<P>
SNP leader Alex Salmond told his party's annual conference,
held in the Scotish city of Inverness, that the death of Britain
-- born in 1707 from the Act of Union between Scotland and England
-- was at hand, the Reuters reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Salmond has never before made a prediction about
when Scotland would gain its independence.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Salmond made three key pledges to the people of
Scotland and said independence remains the ultimate goal.
</P>
<P>
He said the nationalists were now established as the main
opposition party in the Scottish Parliament and would ultimately
become Scotland's government.
</P>
<P>
"Our key task as a national party is to make the case for this
parliament becoming a real parliament -- an independent parliament
-- with full powers," he said.
</P>
<P>
Salmond also made a renewed commitment to "fair tax" during his
speech and accused Chancellor Gordon Brown of creating a
multi-billion war chest to offer tax cuts before the next
election.
</P>
<P>
"Our position is different. Spend the resources on the things
that really matter - health education and housing," he said.
</P>
<P>
If Salmond's prediction is to come true, that means the SNP
would have to win the next election for the Edinburgh parliament
in 2003.
</P>
<P>
The party has promised not to hold a referendum on independence
until near the end of a four-year term in charge -- placing the
date for a referendum just before 2007.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak Urges Joint Efforts to Promote Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak called Friday on the people to join efforts to make
overall reforms materialized.
</P>
<P>
In a nationwide televised speech, Mubarak urged the Egyptians
to work together to make sure that the democratic practices are
guaranteed and promoted, freedom of expression entrenched and
concept of social justice will take root.
</P>
<P>
Ever since the Egyptian people entrusted him with the
leadership responsibility in October 1981, he and the Egyptian
people have pledged to undertake the duties for national
development, the Egyptian president said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, who was re-elected in 1987 and 1993, delivered the
speech ahead of the referendum due on Sunday to endorse parliament
nomination for him to be in power for another six years.
</P>
<P>
He called on the 20 million tangible voters to participate in
the referendum, which he said "is not on the choice of a person
but on a program of overall revival of Egypt."
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian people should concentrate their efforts on
realizing the goal of developing the nation, Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
After the economic reforms that was kicked off in 1991 have
achieved the targeted goals, Egypt should move towards social and
cultural development in a bid to make tangible progress in the
people's overall living standard, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"We, standing on the threshold of the 21st century, must take
the necessary steps for a comprehensive national program aimed at
realizing a strong technological advancement, providing free and
democratic climate and strengthening the role of governmental and
non-governmental institutions," Mubarak said.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Cloud over Next Zambian Presidential </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Both Zambia's opposition and
ruling parties expressed their concerns over who will contest for
the coming presidential elections in 2001.
</P>
<P>
It is still uncertain whether Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba and its former President Kenneth Kaunda will be rivals in
the election campaign.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, head of the Zambia's opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP), said his party has no objection to
President Chiluba to stand for a third term if he is adopted by
his Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD).
</P>
<P>
Basil Kabwe, administrative secretary of the UNIP, said, "we
would like to see him (Chiluba) stand so that we can have a
rematch between Dr. Kaunda and Mr. Chiluba."
</P>
<P>
In return, the ruling MMD has also given Kaunda a green light
to the political arena by saying that it would not stop Kaunda
from contesting for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
MMD National Secretary Michael Sata said: "There equally should
not be any trouble if the MMD field Chiluba for the polls."
</P>
<P>
"We have no problem whom UNIP fields because it's not our
business to stop other parties from putting up candidates of their
choice," Sata said.
</P>
<P>
All political parties are free to choose their presidential
candidates and field them without any problems from other parties,
Sata added.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda ruled the country from its independence in 1964 until
1991, when he was defeated by Chiluba in the multi-party elections
of that year.
</P>
<P>
He was barred from running for the presidency in the elections
held in 1996 because constitutional amendments adopted that year
do not allow those with foreign parentage and those who have
already served two terms of the presidency to stand for elections
any more.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda, born of Malawian parents, and his party have been
opposed to the constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
The opposition urged the ruling MMD to remove the clauses in
the constitution to allow the two leaders to contest in the next
elections.
</P>
<P>
President Chiluba has repeatedly stated that he will not
violate the constitution that limits a president to two five-year
terms but recently some MMD officials, especially MMD youth wing,
urged Chiluba to run for a third term and called for a
constitutional amendment to allow Chiluba to do so.
</P>
<P>
However, when asked if he is considering running for the third
term, the president said: "I'm not saying that leaders must not
stay too long but they must justify why they want to stay longer,"
describing the calls for his third term as democracy.
</P>
<P>
Recently some MMD officials, especially MMD youth wing, urged
Chiluba to run and called for a constitutional amendment to allow
him for a third term.
</P>
<P>
MMD youth on the Copperbelt Province held a rally, demanding
Chiluba to stay on, describing him as "a national asset".
</P>
<P>
Copperbelt Province youth Chairman Josiah Mutisa said that
"President Chiluba is a national asset who cannot be allowed to
retire just like that. The MMD and the constitution are not enough
to warrant his departure."
</P>
<P>
The chairman said his members will soon petition other
provinces for a national youth conference so that the idea of
floating President Chiluba in the 2001 elections can be tabled.
</P>
<P>
Copperbelt Deputy Minister Mathew Mulanda said the MMD
leadership is in full support of the youths because there are a
number of things not yet accomplished by Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
On Monday MMD youths in Lusaka Province joined their colleagues
in other provinces calling on Chiluba to stand for another term of
office.  They urged the government to amend the constitution
so as to allow Chiluba to contest the presidency again.
</P>
<P>
Provincial youth chairman Stephen Bwalya said at the gathering
that "the economic situation in our country needs a person of the
current president's calibre for it to forge ahead."
</P>
<P>
Sonny Mulenga, MMD chairman of the Lusaka Province told the
gathering that there is nothing wrong with changing the
constitution as long as the majority of the people favor the
proposed amendments.
</P>
<P>
Mulenga, who is also Lusaka Province Deputy Minister, said that
it has been difficult to find a successor and that Chiluba's
achievements have attracted international support.
</P>
<P>
But chief government spokesman, Information Minister Newstead
Zimba said early this month that the government is not going to
amend the constitution to suit any political party or particular
presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
Kaunda accused early this month Chiluba of being behind "the
growing mild campaign for his third term in office".
</P>
<P>
The UPND and National Citizens Coalition (NCC) are opposed to
the calls for Chiluba's third term of office.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Air Raids on Chechnya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Federal fighter jets continued
their bombing raids over the breakaway republic of Chechnya
Friday, hitting oil tanks, refineries and radio and television
transmission facilities near Grozny, the regional capital, Russian
medial reports said.
</P>
<P>
Air force commander Anatoly Kornukov said federal aircraft will
strike at Chechen guerrillas wherever they may be.
</P>
<P>
"The actions of Russia's air force are in compliance with a
program approved by the General Staff of the Russian armed
forces," the Interfax news agency quoted Kornukov as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Our main task is to rule out the possibility of new
provocations on the (Chechnya's) administrative border with
Daghestan, Ingushetia, and the Stavropol and Krasnodar
territories. We must not allow aggression to repeat," he said.
</P>
<P>
Islamic militants from Chechnya launched two waves of assaults
on Daghestan since August. Federal troops drove out the rebels at
both times.
</P>
<P>
The rebel incursions and several terrorist explosions that
claimed the lives of more than 300 people in several major Russian
cities, including Moscow, have steeled the authorities' resolve to
deal heavy blows to the militants in Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
"Strikes were inflicted on several oil refineries to disrupt
the separatists' oil supplies and hamper their maneuvers in and
outside Chechnya," Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
Federal aircraft destroyed an An-2 plane and a radar station
near Grozny's airport on Thursday. The station "controlled
airspace over Chechnya and was a source of increased danger for
federal aviation," Kornukov said.
</P>
<P>
"We are resolutely minded and will be fulfilling the tasks
facing us until we eliminate the guerrillas," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Aslan Maskhadov, president of the Chechen republic,
has urged Moscow to stop the bombing raids and go to the
negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
"A pending catastrophe in the North Caucasus can be averted and
thousands of Russians and Chechens can be saved if Russia's
leadership consents to resolve problems at the negotiating table
by political methods," Interfax quoted Maskhadov as saying Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the intensified air strikes against Chechnya are "a
waste of effort, means and time" and that "it will all boil down
to negotiations anyway."
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who was visiting Kazakhstan,
said the federal bomb attacks would be made solely on terrorist
bases.
</P>
<P>
"We will be after them everywhere. If we track them in a
lavatory, forgive me for saying so, we will do them in there,"
Interfax quoted Putin as saying.

<HEADLINE> Bank Of Scotland Bids For Natwest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) - The Bank of Scotland launched a
surprise 20.85 billion pounds bid Friday for NatWest in what would
be the biggest takeover in the history of British banking.
</P>
<P>
The proposed deal would create the UK's biggest banking group
by value after HSBC and LloydsTSB, overtaking Barclays which is
currently the third largest.
</P>
<P>
Under the Bank of Scotland proposal, NatWest shareholders would
end up holding approximately 68 percent of the total issued Bank
of Scotland shares.
</P>
<P>
NatWest has a market capitalisation of 17.7 billion pounds,
more than twice as big as Bank of Scotland's 8.9 billion, based on
Thursday's close.
</P>
<P>
The Bank of Scotland's offer would be conditional on NatWest's
proposed 10.7 billion pounds takeover of insurance group Legal and
General Plc not proceeding.
</P>
<P>
However, the Bank of Scotland said NatWest would remain a
separate unit, retaining its name.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Involved in Evolution of Dictionary (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Work on the new dictionary started in Shanghai in September,
1958. Numerous experts and scholars joined the comprehensive
effort, producing a "Cihai" that included 100 subjects, such as
politics, economics, culture, military affairs, diplomacy and
religion.
</P>
<P>
The first draft of the new dictionary was completed in March
1960, and in 1965 a draft edition was published. After reading it,
Mao offered his suggestions for changes of some items that
appeared in the publication.
</P>
<P>
The project was suspended at the start of the Cultural
Revolution (1966-1976), but in March, 1971, late Premier Zhou
Enlai announced at a national publication conference that the work
should be renewed.
</P>
<P>
In 1974, leader Deng Xiaoping also urged military departments
to provide written materials and documents detailing battles and
military affairs to be included as references in the dictionary. (

<HEADLINE> Chinese Leaders Involved in Evolution of Dictionary (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Since the founding of New
China in 1949, generations of Party and government leaders have
been involved in the publishing of the country's largest and most
prestigious dictionary, the "Word Ocean."
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin, Chinese president and the general secretary of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee, recently completed a
calligraphic representation of the dictionary's Chinese name "
Cihai" for its 1999 edition.
</P>
<P>
In 1957, Chairman Mao Zedong, the founder of New China, decided
the existing "Cihai" should be re-edited. Mao consulted Shu
Xincheng, a famous Shanghai-based Chinese literature expert who
had compiled a previous edition of the dictionary in 1936 as the
publication's editor-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
"I have been with the dictionary for 20 years, even in battles,
" Mao said, realizing, however, that the old edition contained too
many archaic entries. "It's vital that we publish a new dictionary
for new people, new things and new words in new China," he said.
</P>
<P>
After a few months, Mao again spoke with Shu, who suggested
that when editing of the new "Cihai" was finished, encyclopedia
should be added to the list of China's needed publications.
</P>
<P>
The "Cihai" provides a foundation for the encyclopedia, Mao
said, adding that the entire project would be long-term and
involve Chinese scholars from generation to generation.

In 1979, the three-part "Word Ocean" was published to mark the
30th anniversary of the founding of New China. At that time, the
country launched the plan to update the dictionary every ten years.
</P>
<P>
The 1989 and 1999 editions have attracted the attention of
President Jiang Zemin, who has encouraged the editors to put
together dictionaries that will be more useful to readers.
</P>
<P>
In his term as Shanghai mayor ten years ago, Jiang produced a
calligraphic representation for the dictionary's 1989 edition to
praise the editors' hard work and outstanding literary skill.
</P>
<P>
Xia Zhengnong, chief editor of the dictionary, said that over
the past 50 years, Chinese leaders as well as dozens of central
governmental departments have shown their interest in and made
considerable contributions to the editing of the "Cihai."

<HEADLINE> Annan Sees Illicit Small Arms Trade Bad to World Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan Friday said that the illicit small arms trafficking not
only aggravates the violence associated with terrorism and
organized crime, but also damages development prospects and
imperils human security in every way.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. chief made the statement at the Security Council's
open ministerial meeting on small arms, which total some 500
million across the world.
</P>
<P>
"The proliferation of small arms, ammunition and explosives has
also aggravated the violence associated with terrorism and
organized crime," he said. "Even in societies not beset by civil
war, the easy availability of small arms has in many cases
contributed to violence and political instability."
</P>
<P>
"These, in turn, have damaged development prospects and
imperiled security in every way," he said. "Indeed, there is
probably no single tool of conflict so widespread, so easily
available, and so difficult to restrict, as small arms."
</P>
<P>
"Not only are they the primary instrument of the murder of
civilians who are increasingly targeted in the wars of our era,"
he said. "Unlike their victims, small arms survive from conflict
to conflict, perpetuating the cycle of violence by their mere
structures," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also called on the U.N. Security Council, which
has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of world peace
and security, to devote greater attention to the conflict
prevention and provide effective leadership in this area.
</P>
<P>
"While great challenges still await us, we should take note of
a number of positive development in the struggle against small
arms proliferation, and particularly illicit arms trafficking," he
said.
</P>
<P>
In Africa, through an initiative by Mali, the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) declared a moratorium on
the production and transfer of small arms, covering 16 countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations Development Program (UNDP) is assisting
ECOWAS in implementing that moratorium, he said.
</P>
<P>
In Europe, joint action by the European Union in preventing
and combatting illicit trafficking in conventional arms is
another promising step, Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"More specifically, in Albania, the UNDP, in close
collaboration with the Department for Disarmament Affairs, has
been engaged in a 'Weapons for Development' project," he said.
"The success of that pilot project has encouraged the Albanian
Government to invite similar projects in other parts of Albania."
</P>
<P>
And in America, the Organization of American States adopted in
November 1997 the Inter-American Convention against the Illicit
Manufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition,
Explosives and Other Related Materials.
</P>
<P>
"The momentum for combatting small arms proliferation has also
come from civil society, which has been increasingly active on
this issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The establishment early this year of the International Action
Network on Small Arms helped to sharpen public focus on small
arms, which has helped us gain the public support necessary for
success," he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to develop the international consensus on the small
arms, the United Nations plans to convene an international
conference on illicit small arms trade in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"The international community must seize the opportunity by the
international conference in the year 2001 to demonstrate its
political will and its commitment to reversing the global
proliferation of small arms," he added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Scholar On Social Development in 21st Century </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua)-- The international society will
enter an age of knowledge-based economy in the 21st century, which
is called the "second modernization progress," a Chinese scholar
told a seminar today on social development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
"If the progress from the farming age to the industrial age is
the 'first modernization progress,' the advancement from the
industrial era to the knowledge era can be named the 'second
modernization progress'," said He Chuanqi, a research fellow with
the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
He said that the second modernization progress will be marked
by knowledge, computers and international cooperation, while the
characteristics of the first are industrialization, urbanization
and democratization.
</P>
<P>
"In a word, the first one is conquering the nature and the
second one is returning to the nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also presented his tentative plan on China's second
modernization progress, saying that the latest knowledge
renovation has given China new developing opportunities and
challenges, which demands the country accomplish the modernization
progress in the next 50 years.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of scholars from academic units such as the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, Beijing University and Qinghua
University attended the seminar. They affirmed that He's new
theory is rational and creative though it still needs some
revision.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Ministers to Discuss Tariff Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers of member
countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
will meet next week to discuss tariff reductions, a senior
official from Thailand's Commerce Ministry said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Karun Kittisataporn, director-general of the Department of
Business Economics, said that the issue of accelerating tariff
cuts of products among ASEAN members to zero to five percent by
the year 2000 would be on the top agenda of the 31st Meeting of
ASEAN Economic Ministers, to be held between September 27 to
October 2 in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
According to the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) starting from
January 1, 2000, ASEAN members will reduce tariff rates on 85
percent of their goods to between zero and five percent.
</P>
<P>
In Thailand, 85 percent of its good amount to 7,777 items,
Karun said.
</P>
<P>
"At the meeting, Thailand will also submit an additional list
of 1,190 items of products that are subject to tariff reductions
to the zero to five percent by next year," he said.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN members had also agreed to begin reducing import tariffs
of non-processed agricultural products in the sensitive and
highly-sensitive groups to zero to five percent between 2001 and
2003 so that the products would be fully liberalized by January 1,
2010, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tariff reduction for rice, which is a highly-sensitive
non-processed farm product, would be begun between 2001 and 2005
so that it would be fully liberalized by January 1, 2010, he
noted.

<HEADLINE> China Reaffirms Willingness to Provide Aid to Taiwan Compatriots ( RECAST) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China today reaffirmed its
willingness to provide any necessary aid to its Taiwan compatriots
to help reduce the losses caused by the strong quake that hit the
island Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jincheng, vice-president and secretary-general of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS),said
that after knowing the quake rocked Taiwan, a rescue team,
comprised of noted seismologists, disaster relief experts, and a
medical team of the mainland were formed and were ready to leave
for Taiwan. He expressed the wish that the Taiwan side would allow
them to enter Taiwan as soon as possible so that they could render
their help.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that shortly after the quake on Tuesday morning,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent his condolence to the Taiwan
compatriots and expressed the mainland's willingness to provide
all necessary aid.
</P>
<P>
He said the ARATS, authorized by the mainland, on Tuesday sent
a letter to Taiwan's Foundation for Exchange Across the Taiwan
Strait regarding aid to the quake-struck areas.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the State Council also issued a circular, asking local
departments to facilitate those Taiwan compatriots who wish to go
back to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
But Taiwan's response on Thursday evening made it clear that
the mainland's relief plan would not be carried out as planned,
Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
Sun Aimin, secretary-general of the Red Cross Society of China,
said his society is deeply concerned about the situation in Taiwan
and is looking forward to starting its rescue work in Taiwan in
accordance with the Red Cross's spirit of humanism and neutrality.
</P>
<P>
Though the Taiwan Red Cross has said that no aid in the forms
of personnel or materials is needed at present, Sun said his
organization would continue to closely monitor the situation in
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Red Cross Society of China will also work closely with its
international counterparts to support relief efforts for Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
He Yongnian, head of the Across-Straits Seismological Exchange
Center, said seismologists on the mainland are looking forward to
join their Taiwan counterparts in monitoring the aftershocks and
providing technical support.
</P>
<P>
Li Bengong, head of the China Disaster Mitigation and Relief
Association, said his association and all disaster relief
organizations across the country are also ready to render
humanitarian aid to the quake-struck areas.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Troops In Congo Expected to Go Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean troops deployed
in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) can be expected to
go home at anytime as peace in the war-torn central African
country is at hand.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Defense Minister Moven Mahachi made these remarks
on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi said: "As soon as the United Nations peace-keepers
arrive in the DRC, a timetable would be drawn for the withdrawal
of the allied forces."
</P>
<P>
But, "we cannot withdraw immediately because the enemy is still
in position," the Zimbabwe News Agency quoted the defense minister
as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the United Nations had already started to deploy
military liaison officers in Zambian capital Lusaka and Rwandan
capital Kigali to monitor the cease-fire agreement for the DRC.
</P>
<P>
So far, the cease-fire had been holding as only isolated
movements of rebels had been reported and the allied forces was
monitoring the situation closely, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi also called for the private sector to take advantage of
the goodwill fostered by the Zimbabwean Defense Forces during the
intervention in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
He said that the defence forces had formed a civilian company
which, with a sister company in the DRC, would act as facilitators
for potential investors in the DRC.
</P>
<P>
This was in line with efforts by the defense forces to try to
find income-generating projects to boost its strained funds, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean business people can explore business opportunities
in such areas as tourism, transport and mining, he said.

<HEADLINE> 48% Russians See Brezhnev Epoch as Golden Era </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Nearly half of all Russians
recently polled regard Leonid Brezhnev's epoch as "a golden era"
when "ordinary people" lived best of all, the Interfax news agency
reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The idea was held by 48 percent of respondents to the poll
conducted by the Public Opinion fund among 1500 urban and rural
areas on September 4.
</P>
<P>
The respondents were asked to choose the Russian leaders in the
20th century under whom "ordinary people live best of all." They
were given nine names, from Tsar Nicholas II to incumbent
President Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
The pollsters also posed another question related to elections:
if any 20th century Russian leader or eminent contemporary Russian
politician (18 were listed) ran for president today, for whom
would you vote for?
</P>
<P>
Brezhnev and his successor, Yuri Andropov, enjoyed the highest
support with 12 percent. Among the current politicians, most
respondents' support would be given to ex- Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov (10 percent) and Russian Communist Party Leader Gennady
Zyuganov (7 percent). Joseph Stalin was also favored by 7 percent.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Accused of Insisting on Anti-Cuba Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuba on Friday accused
the United States of continuing to act against the international
call for ending the U.S. imposed economic blockade targeting the
republic in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the 54th Session of the U.N. General Assembly,
Foreign Minister Felipe Perez Roque said the 40-year sanctions
have dealt a savage blow to his country's major source of
employment and revenue and depriving it of essential funds for
acquiring food, medicine, fuel and raw materials.
</P>
<P>
The blockade has gone as far as to prevent Cuba from importing
even a U.S.-made aspirin or exporting to the U.S. a single flower
cultivated in Cuba, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1992 the U.N. General Assembly has consistently adopted a
resolution on the necessity of ending the blockage, amid
international condemnation of the U.S. "genocidal policy", he
added.
</P>
<P>
The support for Cuba has grown from year to year with the
resolution receiving votes from 59 in 1992 to 157 in 1998 while
the U.S. has managed to obtain only 3 or 2 votes over the years,
the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Based on the 1948 U.N. Convention on the Prevention and
Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, Cuba's parliament decided 11
days ago that the Cuban courts have the right to try and punish
the parties guilty of "genocidal" activities against Cuba, Perez
Roque said.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.N. Increases Concerns on Small Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security
Council Friday convened an open meeting on the proliferation of
small arms, which, though small in size and light in weight, have
created big casualties in the world today.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, held at the ministerial meeting during the general
debate of the 54th General Assembly session, shows the growing
concerns of the United Nations on small arms.
</P>
<P>
More than tanks, missiles and mortars, one half billion small
arms and light weapons are circulating in the world today. They
are responsible for killing three million people in the last
decade alone. No fewer than 8 of every 10 people killed were
children and women.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations, long focused on nuclear weapons and
conventional disarmament, has become increasingly concerned over
the role of small arms, particularly in internal conflicts and in
the hands of insurgents, criminals and terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
From the Balkans to East Asia and to Africa, small arms have
become the instrument of choice for the killers in the current
world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Security Council, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said, "The proliferation of small arms, ammunition and
explosives has also aggravated the violence associated with
terrorism and organized crime. Even in societies not beset by
civil war, the easy availability of small arms has in many cases
contributed to violence and political instability."
</P>
<P>
These, in turn, have damaged development prospects and
imperiled human security in every way. "Indeed, there is probably
no single tool of conflict so widespread, so easily available, and
so difficult to restrict, as small arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
In his latest report to the Security Council, Annan said,
"Small arms are widely used in conflicts in which a high
proportion of the casualties are civilians, and in which violence
has been perpetrated in gross violation of international
humanitarian law."
</P>
<P>
"This has led to millions of deaths and injuries, the
displacement of populations, and suffering and insecurity around
the world," he said. "While regions such as Africa and the
Americas have been affected more than others, the proliferation of
small arms and light weapons knows no boundaries."
</P>
<P>
Small arms were defined as weapons designed for personal use,
such as revolvers, rifles, carbines, sub-machine guns, assault
rifles and light machine guns.
</P>
<P>
Light weapons, designed for use by a crew of several persons,
range from heavy machine guns and portable anti-aircraft and
anti-tank guns and missile launchers, to mortars of less than 100
millimeter calibre.
</P>
<P>
Globally, it has been estimated that more than 500 million
small arms and light weapons are in existence, a U.N. report said,
adding that "they continue to be produced in large numbers: mostly
in developed countries, though they are now manufactured on an
industrial scale in more than 70 countries and in numerous
countries as a craft industry."
</P>
<P>
Early this year, the major U.S. newspaper "Washington Post"
reported the U.S. efforts to export small arms to the outside
world through various kinds of ways and means, thus becoming a
dominant force on the world small arms market.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has played a leading role in raising
awareness and understanding of the excessive and destabilizing
accumulation and transfer of small arms and light weapons, and in
promoting international efforts to address this problem.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the General Assembly requested the Secretary-General
to prepare a report with the assistance of a panel of experts on
the nature and causes of such accumulation and transfers and on
ways and means to prevent and reduce them.
</P>
<P>
This report acted as a catalyst to place the issue of small
arms and light weapons firmly on the international agenda, and the
United Nations has continued to encourage and support all efforts
to address the wide-ranging problems posed by such weapons.
</P>
<P>
U.N. experts made some new recommendations, some of which
fairly obvious, ranged from urging states to "exercise the
utmost restraint in transfers" of small arms and ammunition to
areas of conflict, to ensuring weapons carry markings to
identify their country of origin and the manufacturer.
</P>
<P>
Another proposal was that "practical disarmament measures
should be developed and adopted in Kosovo related to small arms
and light weapons collection."
</P>
<P>
An earlier recommendation was for the United Nations to help
convene an inter-Afghan forum aimed at retrieving and destroying
small arms left unaccounted for in that civil war-ravaged country
once national reconciliation is reached.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations plans to hold an international conference on
the illicit arms trade by 2001 in order to develop international
consensus on ways and means to effectively combat and prevent
illicit arms trafficking and transfers of small arms and light
weapons.

<HEADLINE> China Sees Sovereignty Over Efforts to Solve Small  Arms Problems </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China said here Friday
that the international community, when trying to solve the
problems caused by small arms, should fully respect the
sovereignty of countries concerned and refrain from interfering in
the internal affairs of countries in conflict.
</P>
<P>
The statement came as Wang Guangya, assistant foreign minister
of China, was addressing an open meeting at the Security Council on
small arms.
</P>
<P>
"In trying to solve the problems caused by small arms, the
international community should fully respect the sovereignty of
countries concerned and refrain from interfering in the internal
affairs of countries in conflict regions so as to avoid further
complicating the matter," he said.
</P>
<P>
"While efforts are being stepped up to eliminate the adverse
impact of small arms, full consideration should be given to the
rightful self-defense an security needs of countries and guarantee
their legitimate right to possess, manufacture and transfer small
arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the United Nations peackeeping and post-conflict
peace-building process, weapons confiscation and disposal measures
should be carried out strictly within given mandate with due
respect to and compliance of the agreement and arrangement reached
voluntarily among parties concerned," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The issue of small arms arises from rather complex roots and
covers wide and diversing areas," he said. "It is imperative to
treat both the root cause and the symptom of the problem and carry
out incisive analysis of the cause."
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the excessive accumulation and illegal
transfer of small arms have intensified the conflict in some
regions and caused civilian casualties.
</P>
<P>
"The international community, including the United Nations, has
taken various measures to reduce and ultimately eliminate the
negative impact of small arms," he said.
</P>
<P>
"China exercises strict control on the manufacturing and export
of small arms," he said. The Chinese Government promulgated laws
on gun control and mangement of military material export in 1996
and 1998 respectively.
</P>
<P>
"China has scored outstanding achievement in cracking down on
the illegal manufacturing and smuggling of guns," he said. "It is
willing to join the international efforts in solving the problem
of small arms at an early date."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 24 (Xinhua) -- China today reaffirmed its
willingness to provide any necessary aid to its Taiwan compatriots
to help reduce the losses caused by the strong quake that hit the
island Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Jincheng, vice-president and secretary-general of the
Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS), made
the comment at a press conference attended by officials of the Red
Cross Society of China, the Across Straits Seismological Exchange
Center and the China Disaster Mitigation and Relief Association.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the priority now is to reduce the life and property
losses of Taiwan compatriots -- which has nothing to do with
politics.
</P>
<P>
He said China welcomes any form of humanitarian aid to Taiwan
by the international society through non-government channels.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that shortly after the quake on Tuesday morning,
Chinese President Jiang Zemin sent his condolence to the Taiwan
compatriots and expressed the mainland's willingness to provide
all necessary aid.
</P>
<P>
He said the ARATS, authorized by the mainland, on Thursday sent

</P>
<P>
But Taiwan's response on Thursday evening made it clear that

Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
As the mainland's rescue team, comprised of noted seismologists,
disaster relief experts, and a medical team were ready to leave
for Taiwan, the ARATS official expressed the wish that the Taiwan
side would allow them to enter Taiwan as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Zhang denied reports that China had refused to open its airways
to airplanes carrying foreign aid to Taiwan, calling them "pure
rumors."
</P>
<P>
He added that it was through the mainland's air corridor that
an airplane carrying aid to Taiwan from the Red Cross Society of
Russia had flown to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Sun Aimin, secretary-general of the Red Cross Society of China,
said his society is deeply concerned about the situation in Taiwan
and is looking forward to starting its rescue work in Taiwan in

UNITED NATIONS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Friday urged the joint efforts from both the
developed and developing countries in reducing and eliminating
absolute poverty in the world.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Ministerial Meeting of the Group of 77, Annan
said the central challenges facing the Group of 77 and its
development partners could be summarized in two words, development
and peace.
</P>
<P>
Annan said the violence and social tensions which afflicted so
many developing countries were caused, in part at least, by
deprivation and inequality.
</P>
<P>
The key decisions had to be taken by national government, in
both developed and developing countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"It is they who must focus their energies on implementing the
measures to which they had already agreed, on both the national
and international levels," Annan said.
</P>
<P>
"At the national level, governments must give priority to
job-creation strategies, in the countryside as well as the cities,
while carrying out structural reforms and promoting private sector
development," he said,
</P>
<P>
"The developed countries must take the actions needed to
provide higher levels of development assistance, debt relief, and
improved market access to the developing countries." the U.N.
chief said.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations would continue to focus it energies and
resources on the task of reducing and eliminating the absolute
which had condemned so many millions of the people to a life of
misery and degradation, he added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Doctors Urged to Return to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe Friday asked the country's junior doctors to end the strike
they have undertaken since Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe told a press conference in Harare that he was aware of
the doctors' demand for raising salary but opposed to strike.
</P>
<P>
"The strike is a sad development and one obviously regrets that
the doctors resorted to such an action. Their argument cannot be
flowed but their action cannot be condoned. I demand that they go
back to work," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of junior doctors, the backbone of the country's
medical system for the majority poor, went on strike demanding a
review of their salaries, an increase in allowances and
improvement of their working conditions.
</P>
<P>
The strike which entered into the fourth day on Friday had
spread to all parts of the country, paralyzing major hospitals'
operation.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Health and Child Welfare Minister Timothy
Stamps also called on striking junior doctors to return to work
and save lives of sick people.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he sympathized with the grievances of junior
doctors but they should call off the industrial action because
people were dying in hospitals.
</P>
<P>
Stamps could not be drawn to say what his ministry was doing to
stop the strike.

<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- European stock markets closed
lower Friday after a losing start on Wall Street deepened the
gloom.
</P>
<P>
The UK's FTSE-100 index ended 0.5 percent lower despite
powerful gains in the heavyweight bank sector following the
surprise 20.85 bn pound bid by Bank of Scotland for NatWest.
</P>
<P>
The rest of the market was hit by worries Wall Street was
poised to extend its downward run of three straight daily losses
in which it has lost some 500 points or 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The banking rally helped cushion the FTSE-100 from heavier
losses as it closed 32 points lower at 5,937.6. The blue chips
have lost 1.7 percent of their value since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Xetra Dax was the biggest loser in Europe on the day
as it tumbled 2.1 percent to 5,186.53, a fall of 113 points.
Another negative session brought the week's losses to 2.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bayer AG, down 5.4 percent at 36.45 euros, led the chemical
sector down after management board chairman Manfred Schneider was
reported to say that the third quarter of 1999 had not fully lived
up to his expectations.
</P>
<P>
The CAC 40 in Paris was more resilient but still fell 60
points, or 1.3 percent, to end at 4,540.87. The blue chips have
lost 2.2 percent over the last five trading days.

WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The United States is

Timor, in addition to 243 already deployed in the area, a senior
U.S. military official said on Friday.

"We will provide these additional forces" as Australia asked,
Blair said. But he did not estimate how many more might be sent.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Develops New Strategy For Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank has
announced a new strategy to address the environmental challenges
facing the developing countries.
</P>
<P>
The strategy will build on the bank's mission to fight
poverty, according to the Annual Review of the Environment
released by the bank here Friday.
</P>
<P>
More emphasis will be placed on addressing the environmental
factors that cause health problems such as air and water
pollution, the review said.
</P>
<P>
There will be greater attention to the management of natural
resources such as soil, forests, water and fish -- the life
support systems on which people's livelihoods depend.
</P>
<P>
In addition the strategy will focus on the increasing
vulnerability to natural disasters -- especially of poor
communities -- provoked by flooding and other extreme weather
phenomena.
</P>
<P>
"A great deal has been accomplished over the past decade but
the time has come to recast the challenge," said Ian Johnson,
vice-president for environmentally and socially sustainable
development.
</P>
<P>
"We must both broaden and deepen our approach. Broaden by
working more effectively to address degradation of our natural
resource base, integrating environmental concerns into
macroeconomic policy, and dealing better with the challenges
posed to poor people by the global problems of climate change
and loss of biodiversity," Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
"Deepen by doing a lot more on the basic problems of air
pollution and the lack of access to safe water and sanitation that
continue to dog the lives of poor people the world over," he
added.
</P>
<P>
The new approach reflects the growing consensus that the
environmental agenda should be more closely linked to the
overall development objectives of the developing world with a
focus on impacts and outcomes rather than inputs and processes.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 Annual Review documented the evolution of the bank's
environmental agenda which began with a "do no harm" approach
through the development of safeguard policies on environmental
assessment.
</P>
<P>
In many cases, according to the review, environmental
assessments and compliance with other so-called safeguard policies
had led to better project design and environmental management.
</P>
<P>
To reinforce efforts in this domain, the bank has just
established a new Quality Assurance and Social Safeguard Unit to
ensure that all projects meet its environmental and social
safeguard policies.
</P>
<P>
During the 1990s the bank developed a portfolio of projects
with clear environmental objectives which now amounts to some 15
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Over the past fiscal year, 23 projects with environmental
objectives were approved, amounting to 2 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
"The bank's environmental agenda has shifted over the year
since the Rio Earth Summit in response to the stubborn fact that
poor people continue to bear the brunt of environmental
degradation through ill health, exposure to natural catastrophes
and the destruction of their life-support systems," said Robert
Watson, World Bank director for environment.
</P>
<P>
"We and many others have worked hard to address these
problems over the past decade. But it has not been enough. We
are now focusing our efforts to have maximum impact where there
is maximum need," Watson said.

SANTIAGO, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Chile said Friday that the
case of lifetime senator Augusto Pinochet will not affect the
country's economic relations with Spain.
</P>
<P>
Hector Casanueva, Foreign Ministry Commercial Office director,
said that even if Pinochet's extradition to Spain is approved, the

Augusto Pinochet, charged with crimes against humanity
committed during the 1973-1990 military regime, has been detained

<HEADLINE> Former Italian Premier Acquitted of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Former Italian Premier Giulio
Andreotti and five co-defendants were acquitted Monday evening of
the charge of murdering an investigative reporter in Rome in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The verdict was handed down in the central Italian city of
Perugia at the end of a trial which opened here on April 11, 1996,
and five days of deliberations on the prosecution and defense
arguments in chambers by two professional judges and six jury
members from the general public.
</P>
<P>
Andreotti, 79, the nation's leading Christian Democratic
politician and Italian premier for seven times when the Catholic
party dominated the national political scene until 1994, was
indicted in July 1995 on the charge of complicity in the murder of
Carmine (Mino) Pecorelli on March 20, 1979, with a former
magistrate and cabinet minister, Claudio Vitalone.
</P>
<P>
Four others -- two Mafia bosses and the two alleged murderers
-- were also told in November 1995 to stand trial.
</P>
<P>
The Mafia dons named were Gaetano Badalamenti, in prison in the
United States, and Giuseppe Calo, killed in 1981.
</P>
<P>
Those charged with carrying out the shooting were the hit-man
reportedly preferred by Bontade, Michelangelo La Barbera, and
Massimo Carminati.
</P>
<P>
The prosecution had asked for Italy's stiffest sentence, life
imprisonment, for all six.
</P>
<P>
According to the prosecution, the most famous and reputedly
most reliable of the Mafia informants, Tommaso Buscetta, said that
Pecorelli was killed because he was about to publish revelations
that could hurt Andreotti's political career.
</P>
<P>
In initial testimony to Palermo prosecutors in 1993, Buscetta
said Andreotti had asked old-guard Mafia bosses Bontade and
Badalamenti to get rid of the journalist who was bothering him. He
said he had learned this from the bosses.
</P>
<P>
Buscetta subsequently modified his testimony to say that both
Bontade in 1980 and Badalamenti two years later told him the
murder was performed "in the interests" of Andreotti.
</P>
<P>
After the delivery of the verdict, he said, "I'm a bureaucrat
and, basically, the commitments I had I maintained."

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Republicans, Unionists Review Strategies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland's pro-British
unionist and pro-Irish republican parties met separately in
Scotland and Ireland Saturday to review their strategy ahead of a
new round of peace talks set for next week.
</P>
<P>
Members of Sinn Fein, the political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, gathered in the west of the Republic of Ireland
this weekend for a think-tank on the state of the peace process
and the peace talks chaired by former U.S. senator George Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
Mitchell left Belfast for the United States Thursday after the
latest round of talks but plans to return next Wednesday. Mitchell
said before his departure that he was confident his initiative
would succeed.
</P>
<P>
David Trimble, leader of the Ulster Unionists, also took
members of his party to Glasgow, Scotland, for a weekend
conference to plan their participation in Mitchell's talks and
discuss whether the deadlock -- over IRA disarmament -- can be
broken.
</P>
<P>
The meeting comes days after Trimble was accused of giving
"mixed signals" by supporting a legal challenge to Northern
Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlem's ruling that the IRA ceasefire is
intact, and then subsequently meeting Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary in any sort of situation to be able to step
back and have a think about the situation and consider one's
overall strategy. It's something we do from time to time," said
Trimble, who is Northern Ireland's first-minister designate under
structures set up by the Good Friday accord signed in April last
year.
</P>
<P>
But Trimble's deputy party leader, John Taylor, who is
boycotting the Mitchell talks, did not attend the conference.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein says Trimble's refusal to share power with it in a
planned coalition government unless the IRA disarms is a breach of
the Good Friday accord. Trimble says the IRA must disarm as proof
that it has ended its long war against British rule.

<HEADLINE> DPRK: 21st Century Should Be One of Independence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The 21st century
should be a century of independence in which dominationism and
high-handedness are eliminated and sovereignty of all states
equally respected, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
(DPRK) stressed here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the general debate of the 54th session of the United
Nations General Assembly, DPRK Minister for Foreign Affairs Paek
Nam Sun said that in order to bring about a new century of
independence and durable peace, a just international order never
tolerating high-handness and arbitrariness should be established.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the principles of respect for sovereignty should
be strictly adhered to as the supreme principle in international
relations, and the assertion that disarmament, human rights and
humanitarian issues should be placed above sovereignty should be
firmly denounced as a dangerous attempt to justify high-handness
and arbitrariness, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
"Disputes cannot be settleed properly by means of high-handness
and arbitrariness such as sanctions and the use of force. They
should be resolved through dialogues and negotiations on all
accounts," Paek Nam Sun said.
</P>
<P>
"What is important in establishing a just international order
is to ensure fairness in the formulation and application of
international treaties relating to disarmament, human rights and
so forth. In particular, the double standard of abusing
international law as a pretext for interference in the internal
affairs of and use of force against sovereign states should be
strictly rejected," he added.

<HEADLINE> EU Education Ministers Meet in Finland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HELSINKI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Finland hosted a ministerial
conference on education cooperation between EU members Friday,
official sources said.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting between EU ministers of education was a
prelude for a formal ministerial conference scheduled late in
November.
</P>
<P>
The ministers attending the meeting agreed that reforms for
educational systems are needed to strengthen educational
cooperation between EU countries, and to enhance the quality of
education.
</P>
<P>
The ministers discussed the "rolling agenda" proposed by
Finland, an approach to arranging educational policy that exceeds
EU presidential requirements. The ministers welcomed it as an
approach that could effectively promote exchanges of educational
experience and information among EU member countries, and lead to
decisions on long-term educational policy.
</P>
<P>
In the outline for EU Education 2000-2004, Viviane Reding,
recently elected EU commissioner of education, stressed the
importance of foreign language study for children under the age of
four.
</P>
<P>
"Foreign language education for children is of crucial
importance for the future of the EU," said Reding, who speaks
seven languages.
</P>
<P>
The issue of education is the focus of the month: Finland
hosted ministerial conferences on lifetime education, on the job
training, and higher education in September.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Fourteen people were
killed in a bus crash Friday night near Kokstad in the southeast
region of KwaZulu- Natal, South Africa, according to a local

He was quoted by South African Press Association as saying that
 the bus, while traveling on the N2 highway from Durban to

collision.
</P>
<P>
This is the fourth bus crash since Wednesday. The previous

</P>
<P>
The Saturday Star reported that Transport Minister Dullah Omar
was to meet a number of bus company representatives to discuss the

<HEADLINE> China Beats Thailand at Asian Women's Volleyball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 25 (Xinhua) -- World and Olympic runners-
up China met strong resistance from their Thai peers, fighting
back from one set down to win at 3-1 on Saturday in the finals
round at the 10th Asian Women's Volleyball Championship.
</P>
<P>
Low-rated Thailand, finished fourth in the Asian Games in
Bangkok in 1998, never lost their fighting spirit, leading all the
way in the first set and winning the set at 25-19.
</P>
<P>
The Thais continued to press powerhouse China, leading 16-15 in
the second set. But later they found they still had a lot to
improve.
</P>
<P>
Local crowd favorites China then dominated the match throughout
with their tight blocking, powerful smashing and effective team
combination, winning the following three sets at 25-20, 25-19 and
25-12.
</P>
<P>
"Thailand has nothing to lose, they performed very well today.
But our defense is not so good that let Thais take the first set,
" said Chinese head coach Hu Jin.
</P>
<P>
Though Japan had a good teamwork, sound defense and fighting
character, South Korea, who lost to China 3-2 on Wednesday,
resorted to varied tactics with a string of changes and delicate
spikes, keeping their dominance on the court as they encouraged
themselves not to surrender a single point without exerting every
effort.
</P>
<P>
South Korea outclassed Japan with a score of 25-16, 25-23 and
25-22.
</P>
<P>
"We still have chance to win the title but it depends on the
match between China and Japan," said South Korean head coach Kim
Cheol Yong.
</P>
<P>
He added that he was confident of Japanese team because Japan
had played well against China in the World Grand Prix in August.
</P>
<P>
"We do have chance to beat China, but it's distant and
indistinct," Japanese head coach Kuzuwa Nobuchika.
</P>
<P>
China, which beat Japan eight times in a row this year, will
take on the East Asian opponent on Sunday while South Korea meet
Thailand.

<HEADLINE> "Oriental Rugby" Fantastic in China's National Minorities Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Players of the Red Team were
scattering to make another attack towards the goal area of the
Blue side, with every player seemingly holding something near his
stomach.
</P>
<P>
Before the Blues managed to find out the "Huapao", the one who
carried it has reached the goal area and scored.
</P>
<P>
This is a fantastic scene of a game called "Qiang Huapao", or "
Grab Firecracker". Nick-named Oriental Rugby, it is one of the
fantabulous sports at the on-going Chinese National Games for
Traditional Sports of Minority Nationalities in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"Huapao" is the ball of the game. Made of rubber in the shape
of a disc, it is 14 centimeters in diameter, 2.5 to three
centimeters thick and weighs about 220-240 grams. It is blasted
to mid-air by a throwing machine at the start of each game and
after each goal.
</P>
<P>
The playing field is 60 meters long and 50 meters wide, with
two teams of eight players each competing in two halves, 20
minutes each.
</P>
<P>
A goal is counted for a team when any of its players carrying
the "Huapao" passes the central section of the touch line or puts
it into a basket behind the line. A bamboo fence vertical to the
touch line is installed at each end of the section to prevent
players from entering the goal area other than doing so from
inside the field. The team with more goals at the end of the game
is declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
"Qiang Huapao" was initiated in tribes of the Zhuang and Dong
Nationalities in south China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
"Huapao" was blasted to mid-air by a powder explosion for the
popular game usually played by scores of people at an annual
festival on March 3 in lunar Chinese calendar. The one who
finally obtained the "Huapao" would present it to the chief of the
tribe to be rewarded.
</P>
<P>
The game was later transformed and was introduced as a medal
sport at the National Minorities Games in 1986. The firecracker
has been replaced by the rubber disc, for safety reasons.
</P>
<P>
The competitions at the Beijing Games have attracted a field of
11 teams from various Chinese provinces, municipalities,
autonomous regions and units of Chinese army PLA.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Warn Against Collapse of Mideast Peace Drive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League on Saturday
warned that the Middle East peace process would collapse unless
Jerusalem restores its status and its islamic feature.
</P>
<P>
The league issued the warning in a statement released by its
general secretariat one day ahead of the Jerusalem Day.
</P>
<P>
The Arab nation has opted for peace as a strategic goal, said
the 22-nation pan-Arab forum. But the cherished objective will not
be realized until an independent Palestinian state is established
with Jerusalem as its capital, the league said.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Day marks Israel's digging of a tunnel under Al
Aqsa Mosque in the city four years ago which sparked violent
protests and demonstrations by the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Israel's attempts to Judaize the holy city are "null and void"
and "could not change the status of Jerusalem" as Muslim's third
holiest site, it stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli practices are unilateral moves that are aimed at
imposing a fait accompli and pre-judging the final-status
negotiations between the Palestinians and Israel, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
Israel has never ceased perpetrations in Jerusalem since its
occupation, which are marked by violations of the relevant United
Nations resolutions on the status of the holy city and oppressions
against Palestinian residents and lands.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. resolutions stipulate that Jerusalem is under control
of the world organization. But Israel occupied the whole of the
city in two Arab-Israeli wars and declared in 1980 that it is "the
eternal and undivided" capital of Israel. The Palestinians want
traditional Arab East Jerusalem as capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians and Israel began negotiations for a final
peace agreement on issues including the status of Jerusalem and
Palestinian statehood on September 13.

<HEADLINE> Eastern China's Tide-Watching Festival Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The festival has been held annually since 1994 and has
attracted millions of tourists to Haining on the northern bank of
river, and Xiaoshan on the southern bank.
</P>
<P>
The tide of the Qiantang River near Haining is one of China's
most amazing phenomena. Scientists say that the bell-shaped mouth
of the Qiantang River near the city helps form the not-to-be-
missed "Haining Tide," which has a crest of as high as 3.5 meters.
</P>
<P>
In the past, only the Mid-Autumn Festival, which falls on
September 24 this year, was considered a good time for tide-
watching, but scientists say that the spring tide on Qiantang
River is also worth a look.
</P>
<P>
Numerous activities have been arranged in conjunction with the
tide-watching, organizers said.

</P>
<P>
On the eve of the convocation of the Fortune Global Forum here

arrive in Shanghai to attend the Fortune Global Forum on Sunday.

Rudolph Shlais, vice-president of GM, said here today that the
SGM is the highest-level strategic project in General Motors
outside North America. He said that the joint-venture is also
expected to be the most successful project of GM around the world.
</P>
<P>
"As the largest auto company in the world, General Motors
believes that in order to maintain our global leadership, we must
also be a leader in China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Many economists predict that in the next 20 to 25 years, the
Chinese auto market will grow to be one of the largest auto
markets in the world--we have every confidence that it will," he
told more than 600 Chinese and international guests attending the
10,000-car celebration ceremony this afternoon.

<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton delivered a warm greeting Friday to Chinese Americans
throughout the United States as they prepare to mark the 50th
anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Chinese Americans in Southern California,
the president praised the contributions made to the world by the
people and culture of China.
</P>
<P>
This special occasion -- celebration of the Chinese National
Day-- "reminds us of how much the people and culture of China have
contributed to the world and how, as vital members of the global
community, the Chinese people continue to build on their rich past
to contribute to a brighter future," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said American life has been continually renewed and
enriched by the many different people, including the Chinese, who
have chosen to make the U.S. their country and home and become "
our fellow citizens."
</P>
<P>
"Each (of them) has brought a part of his or her own heritage,
which over time has become part of our common heritage," he
explained. "As we seek to become a more united people, we must not
forget our roots, for they remind us of who we are and of what we
have to share with others."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president praised in particular the Chinese Americans
who have made contributions to the United States.

"You can be proud of your roots and of the many contributions
Chinese Americans have made to our national life. This anniversary
observance offers a welcome opportunity to rejoice in the
diversity that is America's greatest strength and to celebrate the
spirit of community that binds us together as one nation," he said.
</P>
<P>
This is the second letter from the White House to Chinese
Americans in Southern California, who are engaged in a variety of
activities, celebrating the 50th Chinese National Day on October 1.
The first letter came earlier this month to wish success for a
grand gathering in Pasadena Civil Auditorium, where Chinese
artists were giving performances to a local Chinese community in
advance of the Chinese National Day.
</P>
<P>
Several congressmen and senators, as well as California
Governor Gray Davis, and Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riodan, also
wrote to the Chinese Americans in Southern California to mark the
memorable occasion.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Former President Says Modern China in Shape (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- In the eyes of former
Tanzanian president Ali Hassan Mwinyi, China is historically a
civilized nation as well as a modern country gradually taking
shape.
</P>
<P>
"China had held a prominent position in world affairs even
before the creation of modern China 50 years ago. Civilization has
existed for a long time in China as evidenced by the presence of
the ancient monuments such as the Great Wall, as well as the
numerous fortifications and temples," Mwinyi told Xinhua during a
recent interview at his residence.
</P>
<P>
The former president's residence is a three-story white
building located in a garden-like courtyard in the northern
outskirts of the Tanzanian capital Dar es Salaam. The 74-year-old
statesman was sitting barefooted in a parlor with a marble floor.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi said he expects to see more changes in the Asian giant
when he visits Beijing to attend the 50th anniversary of the
People's Republic of China on October 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
"Trade, industry and cultivation were far ahead in China many
years ago before some of the Western industrialized countries were
formed," said Mwinyi. "China was the envy of the world, prompting
Western explorers and travelers like Marco Polo to brave the seas
and oceans in a bid to discover its riches and mysteries."
</P>
<P>
China's tempo of development has completely changed thanks to a
revolution led by late leader Mao Zedong and other eminent
personalities like late Prime Minister Zhou Enlai 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
In the last 50 years, China has become stronger as a united
country under one strong administration. "During the past 50
years China has been able to acquire modern technology in all
fields comparable to other advanced states in the world," he said.
"These include advances in atomic energy, jet technology,
computers and automation.
</P>
<P>
"It is significant that China has become modernized without
losing its cultural heritage and knowledge. In other words,
Chinese characteristics have not changed as a result of
modernization."
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi, who was the president of Tanzania between 1985 and 1995,
said it is also significant that China has been able to adopt
principles of establishing private enterprises in the economy
without losing the main tenets of national unity, and equality of
opportunity for all its people.
</P>
<P>
"Due to China's economic development, the country with 1.2
billion people is now the largest market in the world that no
serious business person can afford to ignore."
</P>
<P>
Despite its achievements, he said, China still has challenges
both at home and abroad.

<TEXT>
<P>
Domestically, he said, China needs to keep up the pace of
economic restructuring and modernization, while maintaining high
efficiency and productivity as well as low levels of inflation and
unemployment.
</P>
<P>
"China will also need to keep on improving the quality of both
urban and rural life," said Mwinyi.
</P>
<P>
On the Taiwan issue, he said that Tanzania and many other
African states do understand the sensitivity and truth about it,
and are therefore ardent supporters of the "one China policy."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that some countries are hypocritical on the
issue: on one hand they support divisive elements in other
countries, and on the other they do not want the same thing to
happen within their own territory.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi said people in Taiwan would eventually abandon the
divisive elements and demand reunion with their brothers and
sisters on the mainland.
</P>
<P>
"After all, the current trend in the world today is to unite,
not otherwise," he said.
</P>
<P>
"I think everyone recognizes the regional and international role
of China after it became the bedrock of stabilization efforts
following the financial crisis last year in the Far East," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwinyi said China is destined to grow stronger in the next
millennium and will be indeed a power to be reckoned with. He
dismissed fears that a strong China would pose threats to the
world, he said.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral relationship, he said, Tanzania and China have had
excellent political and social relations that have been translated
into economic ties.
</P>
<P>
He said Tanzania's projects built with the aid of China, like
Mahonda Sugar Factory, Urafiki Textiles, and UFI-Farm Implements,
should be transformed into joint ventures between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
In addition, he said, private companies and individuals from
both sides should be encouraged to forge joint ventures for mutual
benefit. The former president also invited Chinese businessmen to
invest in Tanzania's agriculture sector, which he said has a vast
potential.

<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Afghanistan's opposition
Saturday said the ruling Taliban militia have launched a major
assault on two districts of the northern province of Kunduz.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the opposition said Taliban forces mounted an
attack with some 6,000 troops backed up by fighter jets on
Dasht-i-archi and Imam Sahib districts, according to news reaching
here.
</P>
<P>
He said heavy casualties have resulted from the fierce fighting
but the Islamic militia have not made any advance toward
opposition positions.
</P>
<P>
There was no independent confirmation so far of the
opposition's claim.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Saturday, a Taliban spokesman rejected speculation that
the militia were preparing for a major offensive against the
opposition in the north.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban control over 80 percent of the war-ravaged country
and have been fighting the opposition for the control of the rest.

<HEADLINE> Lawer Seeks to Bail Out Detained Hamas Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The chief lawer of 21 detained
members of the militant Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement
(Hamas) in Jordan is seeking the release on bail of two of the
Hamas leaders.
</P>
<P>
Saleh Armouti, who heads a 60-man team defending the 21 Hamas
members arrested during a government crackdown on the radical
group, said he is seeking to bail out Hamas poliburo chief Khalid
Mishaal and spokesman Ibrahim Ghosheh.
</P>
<P>
The two men had undergone eight hours of interrogation after
they were arrested Wednesday upon their arrival in Amman from Iran.
</P>
<P>
Armouti said the Hamas members were being interrogated by
state security court Prosecutor General Mahmoud Obeidat, who
would decide whether they would be tried in a court.
</P>
<P>
Police had charged them with engaging in illegal political
activities, possession of weapons and holding military training as
part of their campaigns against Israel.
</P>
<P>
Hamas is known as a radical and militant Palestinian
organization that opposes the peace process between Israel and the
Palestinians, and it has carried out several deadly attacks on
Israeli civilians in recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Hamas is still standing for a holy war "to liberate all
Palestinian territories" to establish an Islamic state.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's crackdown on Hamas came at a time when the peace
process on Israeli-Palestinian track is back on track following
the smooth implementation of revised agreement for the Wye Accord
and the start of the long-overdue final status talks.
</P>
<P>
The start of the final status talks, the most touchy point in
the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, rekindled the hope of
finally achieving peace in the region. Under the new deal, a
permanent peace agreement should be concluded by September 20,
2000.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the only two Arab states that sign peace
treaty with Israel. It is a firm supporter for the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The roundup of Hamas members were apparently preemptive
measures to pave the way, to some extent, for the critical and yet
vulnerable peace process between Israel and the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> EDS-Updates with details Hatoyama Elected New Leader of Japan's Largest Opposition Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Yukio Hatoyama was elected
Saturday as new president of Japan's main opposition Democratic
Party of Japan (DPJ), beating incumbent leader Naoto Kan in a
runoff ballot.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama, the current deputy secretary general of the DPJ,
received 182 of the 314 votes cast in the runoff, while Kan got
130. Two votes were invalid.
</P>
<P>
The runoff was held as none of the three candidates in the DPJ
presidential contest won a majority in the first ballot.
</P>
<P>
In the first ballot, Hatoyama captured 154 votes out of 321
votes cast, seven votes short of the 161-vote majority needed for
a first-ballot victory. Kan got 109 while DPJ Executive Council
Chairman Takahiro Yokomichi, another candidate in the race, gained
57 votes.
</P>
<P>
A total of 321 people, 146 party lawmakers, 81 non-incumbent
DPJ candidates in the next general election and 94 representatives
of local DPJ branches, were eligible voters in the election.
</P>
<P>
Hatoyama, 52, comes from a wealthy political dynasty sometimes
dubbed Japan's version of the Kennedy family. His grandfather
Ichiro Hatoyama was Japan's prime minister from 1954 to 1956, and
his father Iichiro Hatoyama once served as Japan's foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
As new leader of the DPJ, Hatoyama will face the task of
uniting and invigorating the party to counter a new tripartite
coalition that Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, as president
of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), plans to launch with
the Liberal Party (LP) and the New Komeito party.
</P>
<P>
The proposed coalition would give the ruling bloc a majority in
the opposition-controlled House of Councilors, the upper house of
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Kan and Hatoyama co-headed the DPJ after launching the party in
September 1996. Kan became the party's sole leader in September
1997.
</P>
<P>
In April 1998, the party merged with three other opposition
parties under the DPJ banner, becoming Japan's largest opposition
party.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone Rebel Leaders Expected to Return Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leone's rebel leader
Foday Sankoh and its ally former junta's ruler Johnny Koroma are
expected to return to the country's capital Freetown by October 1.
</P>
<P>
A report reaching here from the city quoted a Sierra Leone
presidential aide as saying on Friday that President Tejan Kabbah
is to flag off a new government on or before October 1 which will
include the two in line with a peace accord signed on July 7 in
Togo's capital Lome.
</P>
<P>
The two rebel leaders' continued absence from Sierra Leone has
caused great concern for the governments of its West African
neighbors who helped broker the Lome peace accord.
</P>
<P>
"What we don't know is whether Sankoh and Koroma will be
arriving from Monrovia (the Liberian capital) together. But both
men will be in Freetown before October 1," the aide said.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh's will is to get the position of chairman of a national
minerals commission with the rank of vice-president, while
Koroma, who launched a military coup and ousted the elected Kabbah
for nine months from May 1997 will take charge of a national
commission overseeing the implementation of the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Aides to Sankoh said in Ivory Coast on Friday that his leader
will leave there for Liberia Sunday on his way home to help
implement the peace accord.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last month, Sankoh started his tour of "visiting old
friends" on his way back to Freetown which is proved to be very
long despite the international community's repeated calling for
him to return to step up the peace process.
</P>
<P>
The rebels, who had fought the government since 1991, remain
armed despite the related stipulations in Lome peace accord that
they should be demilitarized in mid August.

<HEADLINE> Former U.N. Secretary General Signs "Peace Scroll" by Chinese Boy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua)-- Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
visiting former secretary-general of the United Nations, signed
here on Friday a long "scroll for peace," or rather a Chinese boy'
s proposal for halting production of all toy weapons.
</P>
<P>
In May of 1995, the five-year-old Tao Yuan in the northernmost
Chinese province of Heilongjiang, wrote to Ghali, then U.N.
secretary-general, proposing to halt the production of all toy
weapons.
</P>
<P>
Ghali replied his letter and appreciated and expressed his
support to the Chinese boy's proposal. Since then, a total of 133
foreign ambassadors to China and representatives from 15 Beijing-
based U.N. organizations have signed the proposal, which has
become 10 meters long and is named as a "Peace Scroll".
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Ghali said he remembered very well
he wrote a reply to Tao Yuan. And he once again paid his attention
to and expressed his concern over the issue of children
development worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Ghali is currently on a visit to China at the invitation of the
United Nations Association of China.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Processing Zones Increase Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Export Processing
Zones recorded an all-time high export of 2.4 billion shillings
(around 40 million U.S. dollars) during the 1998 financial year
(from July 1998 to June 1999) , the East African Standard
newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Peter Muthoka, chief executive of the Export Promotion Council,
was quoted as saying that the 1998 exports increased by 30 percent
against that of the previous year standing at 1.9 billion
shillings.
</P>
<P>
He said the export processing zones are potential growth areas,
 especially for agro-based industries.
</P>
<P>
While outlining the country's prospects for future export, the
chief executive said that 50 percent of the exports from the zones
are destined to the market of the United States, considering that
a quota restriction has been imposed on textile goods from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
About 34 percent of the zones' exports head to the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Muthoka noted that following the success of Kenya's export
processing zones, several other African countries have started
similar zones.
</P>
<P>
He urged the government to take such measures as reviewing the
agriculture policies if Kenya is to maintain its competitive edge
on its exports.
</P>
<P>
Those outdated agriculture policies should be discarded to
ensure Kenya to keep its competitiveness in horticulture and other
agro-based exports, Muthoka said.

<HEADLINE> "Blood Bank" Set Up In Case of Need for Air Accident Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 100 staffers at Tianhe
Airport of Wuhan, the capital of central China's Hubei province,
have signed contracts on donating blood in case of need for
victims at any possible air accident.
</P>
<P>
The voluntary program, the first of its kind launched in the
country, was organized by the first-aid center of the airport,
based on the idea that victims suffering from blood loss in any
air accident will face danger due to the failure of blood supply
caused by the long distance between blood bank and venue.
</P>
<P>
The airport is often quite distant from the urban area. An
official from the station said that 90 percent of air disasters
occur near the airport within 10 minutes after an aircraft takes
off or lands.
</P>
<P>
The contracts also ensure that once needed, the volunteers can
go somewhere in the city to donate bloods to accident victims.

<HEADLINE> Study Shows Obesity Rates Soar in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A new study released
Friday shows that most California residents are choosing fast-food
over more nutritious choices -- and are paying for it with soaring
rates of obesity.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics accumulated by the California
Department of Health Services, nearly half of Californians who ate
out on an average day chose a fast-food restaurant, up from one-
third in 1989. And the number of Californians who are overweight
or obese jumped 50 percent between 1984 and 1997. What's more,
the rate of diabetes rose 25 percent during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Obesity is a known risk factor for adult-onset diabetes, heart
disease, and some types of cancer.
</P>
<P>
"In California, it's expected that approximately 35,000 people
will die this year from illnesses related to poor diet and
physical inactivity," Dr. James W. Stratton, a state health
officer, predicted
</P>
<P>
Most Californians polled blame aggressive television
advertising for their poor food choices, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The new study is based on two surveys. Dietary habits were
assessed by telephone surveys conducted every other year starting
in 1989, while information on weight and physical activity came
from a separate yearly report conducted every year since 1984.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Cattle Farmers Urged to Minimize </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni has urged cattle farmers to minimize the cost of
production through cost- effective farming.
</P>
<P>
The president made the appeal while launching the country's
Beef Producers Association at the Uganda Manufacturers Association
show grounds here Friday, a press release from the President's
Office said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the function, the president announced the lifting of the ban
on the importation of semen, stressing that breeding experts
should work hard to develop local capacity in semen production.
</P>
<P>
Farmers should be encouraged to have their cattle vaccinated to
reduce incidence of cattle mortality and de-worm cows at least
twice a year, he said, adding that the provision of mineral salts
is crucial for successful ranching in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said private entrepreneurs are encouraged to do beef
processing and marketing and the government is ready to co-invest
with them to help solve the problem of financing.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the Beef Producers Association is hailed as a
good move because it could help make important follow-up
procedures on issues crucial for the development of the beef
industry in the country.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Leader Calls Economy Stable Amid Peso Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada said here Saturday that the economic situation in his
country remains stable despite the depreciation of the peso along
with other currencies in the Asian region in recent trading
sessions.
</P>
<P>
In a weekly radio-TV program here, Estrada said the peso is far
better than other Asian currencies, particularly the baht of
Thailand.
</P>
<P>
"There is no reason for concern. That's the way business goes.
But, I am sure our economy is more stable," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the Central Bank of the Philippines and
other concerned government agencies are helping him keep watch on
the peso's situation.
</P>
<P>
During the trading session Friday, the peso dropped to a low of
40.9 to the U.S. dollar, its lowest in more than 10 months.
</P>
<P>
"The peso depreciation doesn't stem from government control. It
is due to external forces," Estrada said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio
interview here Saturday that the central bank remains confident
the peso will bounce back soon and the economy will "recover" some
ground it has lost.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A team of the United Nations
military observers has arrived in Kampala, capital of Uganda, to
observe the cease- fire in the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(DRC).
</P>
<P>
The team is said to be part of the 400-plus U.N. troops to be
deployed in the capitals of the five countries involved in the DRC
conflict, the Monitor newspaper reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan Minister of Defense Steven Kavuma reportedly confirmed
that the team was already in Kampala, but he did not give the
exact number of the cease-fire observers although a security
source put the number at 100.

<HEADLINE> Underground Fire at U.S. Toxic Landfill Burns out of Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, September 24 (Xinhua) -- An underground fire at a
landfill about 100 miles east of Atlanta, the United States,
burned out of control Friday, environmental authorities said.
</P>
<P>
The 120-acre site consists of hundreds of underground trenches
filled with hazardous waste and toxic materials dumped for nearly
50 years. The authorities said they do not know exactly how
dangerous the fumes generated by the fire are to human life.
</P>
<P>
The landfill, which opened in the early 1940s, was closed in
1991 under court order because of the tremendous amount of toxic
waste that had been stored there over the years.
</P>
<P>
The trenches over the years were covered with layers of topsoil
while new trenches were dug on top of the old ones so that more
materials could be stored at the site, said Vince Dollard, of the
Georgia Environmental Protection Division.
</P>
<P>
The result has been that as the underground fire burns, it
releases fumes through pockets that have developed between the
crisscrossed trenches.
</P>
<P>
The fire, discovered on September 9, intensified earlier this
week. A residential neighborhood runs along the perimeter of the
landfill site, so the environmental agency has installed monitors
to measure toxicity.
</P>
<P>
Dollard said the state agency has contacted companies that
dumped materials at the site, and they have agreed to pay for
firefighting expenses, estimated at 20,000 U.S. dollars a day.

<P>
SINGAPORE, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The 31st ASEAN Economic
Ministers Meeting (AEM) and a series of related meetings will be
held here from September 27 to October 2, the Singaporean Ministry
of Trade and Industry (MTI) announced in a press release Saturday.
</P>
<P>
MTI said Singapore Minister for Trade and Industry George Yeo

and Industry, MTI said.
</P>
<P>
According to MTI, the ministers are expected to discuss the
deepening of member countries' commitment to the Common Effective
Preferential Tariff (CEPT) Scheme for the AFTA such as the
reduction of tariffs to zero percent and accelerating the transfer
of products which are currently not included in the tariff
reduction schedule into the CEPT Scheme.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Philippines' Key Sectors 70 pct Y2K ready: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' seven
mission-critical sectors are more than 70 percent Y2K-ready, the
National Security Council (NSC) said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the NSC, the seven sectors are utilities,
telecommunications, transportation, finance, health care,
manufacturing and government.
</P>
<P>
In a report published here, the NSC said that the finance
sector is 95 percent ready for the Y2K; telecommunications, 81
percent; utilities and manufacturing, both 80 percent;
transportation, 79 percent; government, 77 percent; and health
care, 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
Among those institutions with 100 percent Y2K readiness are the
Central Bank of the Philippines and private banks in the country,
as well as the Manila Electric Co. and the oil sector, while the
National Power Corp. is 95 percent ready, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The NSC said that government agencies, such as the Government
Service Insurance System (GSIS), Social Security System (SSS),
Bureau of Internal Revenue, Bureau of Customs and Bureau of
Treasury are in the final stages of their preparations.
</P>
<P>
The Y2K problem, also known as the millennium bug, is a
computer glitch resulting from the use of two digits, instead of
four, to represent the year, which could lead to computer systems
mistaking the year 2000 for 1900, hence jeopardizing operations of
computer-dependent industries.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has set September 30 as the deadline
for all the seven mission-critical sectors to submit their Y2K
readiness reports to the Presidential Commission On Year 2000
Compliance.

<HEADLINE> China Publishes Administrative Districts Encyclopedia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua)-- An inauguration ceremony for
the publication of an encyclopedia on China's administrative
districts was held in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedia, the first of its kind in China, has been
compiled by the Ministry of Civil Administration and published by
the People's Publishing House of Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Li Peng, a member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
and chairman of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing
Committee, wrote a preface for the encyclopedia.
</P>
<P>
The encyclopedia systematically introduces China's current
administration system, evolution in history, geographic locations,
economic situation and cultural characteristics, scenic spots and
sites of historical interest in these regions, ranging from
provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions, special
administrative regions, to 300-plus prefectures, 2,800-strong
counties and over 50,000 townships.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people have joined in the three-year compiling and
editing work of the encyclopedia, which is composed of more than
14 million Chinese characters and divided into five volumes.
</P>
<P>
China is one of the earliest nations in setting up a rather
complete administrative system, which was introduced some 4,000
years ago in the Xia Dynasty (B.C. 21th century - B.C. 16th
century).

<HEADLINE> Australian PM's Doctrine Criticized </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 25 (Xinhua) --Australian prime minister
John Howard's newly produced doctrine has been criticized sharply
in his own country.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with local media earlier this week, John Howard
announced his doctrine, which seeks for Australia a status of the
United State's "deputy" in the region and a more important role in
dealing with the regional affairs, while pushing Australia's value
in Asia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Weekend Australian daily Saturday, Australian
National University security expert Alan Dupont said that "this
deputy sheriff notion is absolute nonsense. It would be totally
counter-productive. It sends all the wrong messages to the region
and reinforces the idea that we are just proxies of the U.S."
</P>
<P>
David Mcgibbon, a former Liberal senator and chairman of the
Joint Parliament Foreign Affairs Committee, said that "the real
danger we face in all this is being seen as a pot-colonial relic,
isolated from Asia in a corner of the Pacific. It's very easy to
run the campaign against Australia that we are isolated in
Asia...."
</P>
<P>
Successive Australian governments had adopted a regional policy
to try to close, melt into and finally become an Asian country and
they established special relationships with Asia. But Prime
minister John Howard plays down any special ties with Asia and
Asian countries, saying that Australia possesses too many special
relations which he believed are not based on the national interest
of Australia.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister had said after taking office in 1996 that
identifying the country's station geographically is "meaningless"
and the native ties with the West is a "wealth" for Australia. He
made clear that his policy in this area is "to stand along with
the West to deal with Asia."

<HEADLINE> French Life Insurer Keen on Chinese Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Patrice Forget, member of the
Executive Board of CNP Assurances S.A., the No.1 life insurer in
France, has described China as one of the most important emerging
life insurance markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
Forget, who visited Beijing as a member of a French trade
delegation, made the comment in an interview with Xinhua during
his Beijing stay.
</P>
<P>
He said his company is very interested in the Chinese market
and wishes to explore it together with Chinese insurers in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1850, CNP is the leading one among France's 130 life
insurance companies. It reported a turnover of 18.1 billion U.S.
dollars and a net profit of 315 million dollars in 1998, with a
market share of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Forget said his company has chosen China as its foothold into
the Asia market, because it has a huge population, but its life
insurance market is only one eighth of the French market, which
means the market has a great potential.
</P>
<P>
Christian Bisschop, chief representative in Beijing for both
CNP and the French Federation of Insurance Companies, said that
life insurance is just beginning in China, but the country's
housing and medical reforms would create a huge market space.
</P>
<P>
He said French life insurers have advantages in experience,
technology, management and development of new products, and are
willing to share such advantages with their Chinese counterparts.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports Up, Deficit Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's trade deficit is
expected to narrow by 54 percent to 23 million U.S. dollars in the
first nine months of 1999 thanks to a rebound in exports and
stationary imports, English daily Vietnam News reported here
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The country's value of exports in the first nine months is
expected to grow 17.2 percent to 8.186 billion U.S. dollars or
81.9 percent of the government's annual target.
</P>
<P>
The rebound of Vietnam's export is because of a recovery in
shipments of footwear products and an increase of the oil prices
in the world, according to Vietnam's General Statistical Office
(GSO).
</P>
<P>
Footwear exports grew 34.5 percent to 1.014 billion U.S.
dollars while garment exports grew 11.9 percent to 1.248 billion
U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Crude oil, Vietnam's No.3 export earner, rose 27.3 percent in
volume to 10.888 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Rice exports, at the fourth place, grew in volume by 22.4
percent to 3.823 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The country's value of imports for the period is expected to
fall 4.8 percent from the same period last year to 8.209 billion
U.S. dollars, representing 71.4 percent of the annual target,
narrowing the gap between imports and exports for the sixth
straight year.
</P>
<P>
According to the GSO, complete vehicles and spare parts imports
dropped most, down 27.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Machine and equipment imports fell nine percents while
pharmaceutical imports dropped by eight percent.
</P>
<P>
Cement clinker imports registered a 63 percent decline to
245,000 tons.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Spends Over 1.5 Billion Dollars in Defending Currency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of
Colombia has spent 1.545 billion U.S. dollars in one year and a
half in defending its exchange band from speculators' inroads,
official sources said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said in the last weeks it was forced to sell
210 million dollars from its international reserves to maintain
the dollar exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
The dollar closed Thursday for a third consecutive day at a
historic low of 1,993.97 pesos per dollar, which forced the
central bank to pull out 142.5 million dollars to stop the
speculators.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, it intervened in the market with more than 1 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry said that speculative outbreaks must be
controlled, warning that those who promote speculation "must be
very careful, because they can suffer a big surprise."
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said it will be impossible to continue
maintaining the exchange bands, because such attempts have taken
place for many times without positive results.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Eel Producers to Open Up More Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China, the world's largest
producer of eels, is expecting the tasty fish to swim into more
streams across domestic and European markets.
</P>
<P>
China has produced 70 percent of the eels sold in the world
last year, and exported 48,000 tons of roast eels to Japan,
occupying 91 percent of its market, according to Lin Meijiao,
deputy director of the National Aquatic Technology Extension
Centre, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
Small eels are a lucrative sector for China, noted Lin. China
produced 163,000 tons of eels in 1998, constituting a meagre 0.4
percent of China's total aquaculture production. While the
turnover reached 26 billion yuan (3.1 billion US dollars),
accounting for 10.3 percent of the total value generated by the
aquatic industry last year, statistics from the Ministry of
Agriculture indicate.
</P>
<P>
Eel exports exceeded 900 million US dollars in 1996, or 30
percent of the total foreign currency brought in by the
aquaculture sector.
</P>
<P>
However, lax control on the eel raising industry and heavy
dependence on the Japanese market have resulted in a host of
problems, Lin told a news conference yesterday.
</P>
<P>
Most of the enterprises marketing eel fries and medicated food
for eels are located in the coastal regions, while eel raisers are
scattered in remote areas, she said.
</P>
<P>
Also too many firms are engaged in importing eel fries. Some
even resort to smuggling the product, causing a huge gap between
procurement and purchase prices, the official said.
</P>
<P>
The worst thing, since Japan is the world's largest eel
consumer, is that a multitude of Chinese enterprises have in the
past been involved in a price-cutting spree. This, coupled with
the fluctuation of the Japanese yen, has resulted in significant
losses to Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
For example, in 1995, China exported 36,200 tons of roast eels
to Japan, valued at 860 million US dollars. However, when the
country's export surged to 53,000 tons in 1998, it only chalked up
620 million US dollars in foreign currency. This represented a 50.
8 percent slash in the price per kilogram, Lin said.
</P>
<P>
"Between 1997 and 1998, China's eel production was maintained
between 140,000 and 160,000 tons, while the Japanese market can
only consume a maximum of 120,000 tons," she said.
</P>
<P>
Experts and officials attending yesterday's press conference
said they believe market potential is huge in China. This optimism
calls for massive efforts.
</P>
<P>
At present, Chinese people consume only 40,000 tons of live
eels, and almost never eat roast eels, according to Liu Zaojun, a
fishery expert from Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The China Eel Industrial Association, which was founded last
year, should help discipline the eel market by curbing blind
import of eel fries and export of eels at low prices, and
promoting eel consumption among Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, training in eel raising and disease prevention is
also needed, noted Zhang Guosheng, deputy director of the Fujian
Provincial Fisheries Department.

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan Economy to Shrink 6.8 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan economy could
shrink 6.8 percent at the end of this year, as a result of the oil
sector crisis, the Finance Ministry said on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The report, "A Pessimistic Scenario for Economic Activity"
released by the ministry, said the country' gross domestic product
(GDP) would drop 12 percent and that of the non-oil sector 4.8
percent.
</P>
<P>
The Venezuelan oil sector closed in 1998 with a one percent
drop and the non-oil sector 0.85 percent, respectively, which
resulted in a GDP drop of 0.7 percent, according to the annual
report from the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV).
</P>
<P>
Figures released by the BCV showed that the Venezuelan economy
dropped 9.5 percent in the first half of 1999, compared to the
same period of 1998.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry's study said that the government of
President Chavez has reduced its expenditures this year by 10
percent to 23 billion dollars. One of the most important
expenditures is the payment of foreign public debt service, which
according to government estimations will be 1.626 billion dollars
in the second half of the year.
</P>
<P>
The government expects that the increase of more than nine
dollars per barrel of oil will be reflected in a reduction of the
budget deficit of 3.6 percent of the GDP against an estimation of
6 percent at the beginning of the year, an approximate cut of 4.4
billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan Discontented With Status Quo of CIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Kazakh President Nursultan
Nazarbayev voiced discontent Friday with the status quo of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) in the Kazakh capital of
Astana, criticizing it for failing to promote regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
"The CIS is losing its sense as a cooperative organization," he
was quoted as saying by the Interfax News Agency. "The CIS is not
heading for integration but rather disintegration," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president made the statement to reporters after
talking with government heads from Russia, Belarus, Kyrgyzstan and
Tajikistan, who met in Astana and signed a series of accords on
economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The four countries plus Kazakhstan set up a customs union last
February in Moscow in an effort to survive the severe economic
aftermath incurred by Russia's financial crisis in addition to the
financial crises in Asia and Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the CIS integration should be an economic
integration in the first place, Nazarbayev said that however the
trade among CIS countries had shrunk 70 percent since 1991.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, he added, transcaucasian
countries saw their trade with CIS members down by 40 percent and
that with Kazakhstan 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he complained, CIS members have signed thousands of
documents, but only 5 to 10 percent of them had been implemented.
</P>
<P>
The Kazakh president hoped that with concrete actions and
measures, the five-nation customs union will be able to set an
example for CIS integration.

NANNING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Former film star Huang Wanqiu
has become so ordinary she can now get lost in a crowd.
</P>
<P>
But over 30 years ago, she had thousands of fans in China and
overseas who loved her in her popular role as the village girl who
sang like a lark in the film "Third Sister Liu."
</P>
<P>
"A good actor should always present the most beautiful and
moving things and will be remembered by the audience no matter how
much time passes," said Huang, now 56, and mother of a grown-up
son and daughter.
</P>
<P>
During the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966-1976),
Huang was persecuted and maltreated, but her life improved in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Huang says that the performing artists' political and economic
status has greatly improved and are respected by society since the
founding of New China in October 1949. In old China, however,
artists were scorned, she recalled.
</P>
<P>
The policies of reform and opening to the world over the past
two decades has revitalized China's artistic community. And
business has been brisk for investors involved in film, television,
calligraphy, the fine arts, and publishing.
</P>
<P>
With the help of local Party organizations and local
governments, Huang set up a range of businesses, and in the mid-
1980s started an art troupe funded with investment from overseas.
She heads the troupe, which has performed across the country and
toured overseas to spread Chinese culture.
</P>
<P>
Huang, currently a member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, pledged that
she would devote the remaining years of her life to teaching and
training more young Chinese performers.

<HEADLINE> China to Play Greater Role in World: Cyprus' Top Lawmaker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The fast-growing China market
is helping the country to play an important role in the post-Cold
War world's new political and economic order, Spyros Kyprianou,
president of the house of representatives of Cyprus, said.
</P>
<P>
In a recent interview with Xinhua, Kyprianou said the People's
Republic of China has gained great achievements in various fields
since its founding 50 years ago, which attracted worldwide
attention.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou, once president and foreign minister of Cyprus, said
that he has been following with interest the development in China.
During the U.N. General Assembly in 1971, Kyprianou, who was then
Cyprus' foreign minister, signed the agreement to establish
diplomatic relations with China. He visited China in 1984 as
president of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Kyprianou said China's political, economic, social and cultural
realities could not be experienced and judged better by anyone
else than its own people. China's ambitious economic reform
program launched in 1978 is certainly of great inspiration, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He said that late senior Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping's broad
vision of a giant state closer and more accessible to the world
and the policy that he introduced and is followed by his
successors not only benefited the country itself, but also
prepared China to meet the post-Cold War challenges with an
unparalleled stable growth averaging 7 to 10 percent since 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said the increasingly important role China is called upon to
play in the world and the regional economy, the country's
performance with regard to financial issues as well as its
potential to become a leading figure even under the most
unfavorable conditions have added to the country's promising
profile of an emerging economic power in modern times.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the recent visit to China by Cyprus' President
Glafcos Clerides, Kyprianou stressed the excellent relations which
"have always existed between Cyprus and China," and have since
gained a new impetus.
</P>
<P>
As parliament speaker, Kyprianou pointed out that at the
parliamentary level, the two countries have consolidated
harmonious relations and cooperation over the year through regular
exchange of visits.

strategic reserves and exports.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bank of Cuba (BCC)
announced Friday the resumption of relations with the British
Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGB), which were interrupted
more than a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
Both institutions signed in London a document that "opens the
way" for the British agency to offer fresh credits to Cuba that
will encourage the export of British capital goods to the island,
said the ECGB in a communique.
</P>
<P>
The ECGB, which is answerable to the Secretary of State for
Commerce and Industry, grants credits for the foreign acquisition
of goods or services from Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
According to the document, Cuba will reimburse the ECGB short
term debts for 8.5 million sterling pounds (14 million U.S.
dollars) in exchange for new credits for the same amount.
</P>
<P>
The ECGB condoned Cuban delays in the payment of interests on
overdue debts, said the Central Bank of Cuba.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Opens Oil Prospection, Exploitation to Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso Friday signed concession contracts for 10
multinational firms to prospect and exploit oil and gas in 12
maritime zones of the country.
</P>
<P>
This ends almost half a century of monopoly by the state firm
Petroleos Brasilenos (Petrobras) in the prospection and
exploitation of oil and gas fields in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
Cardoso signed the documents in the Pequena Gavea Palace in Rio
de Janeiro, saying that the participation of private interests
would permit the country to be self-sufficient in energy by the
year 2005.
</P>
<P>
Brazil needs 1.6 million barrels of oil every day, of which 500,
000 barrels must be imported.
</P>
<P>
The 10 multinational oil companies includes Yacimientos
Petroliferos Fiscales of Argentina, which is controlled by the
Spanish firm Repsol, Agip, Esso, Texaco, Unocal, British Petroleum,
British Borneo, Amarada Hess, Kerr-McGee and Shell.
</P>
<P>
The firms submitted their bids in a contest called last June by
the National Petroleum Agency (ANP) for activities in 27 zones in
the marine watersheds of Campos and Santos, and in the Amazonian
watershed.
</P>
<P>
The ANP will call a second bidding by the end of this year for
private interests in oil exploration. It has obtained 178 million
dollars from the bidding licenses for the 10 multinational firms.
</P>
<P>
Some of the prospection and exploitation projects will be
jointly implemented by Petrobras and multinational companies.

<HEADLINE> Businessmen Urge End to Brazil-Argentina Trade Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 24 (Xinhua) -- A Brazilian businessmen
organization has demanded the end of a trade dispute between
Brazil and Argentina, which it says weakens the Southern Common
Market (Mercosur) in its negotiations with other blocs.
</P>
<P>
"We are spending energy internally that should be directed to
combat protectionism abroad," Sao Paulo State Industrial
Federation Foreign Trade (FIESP) director Luiz Fernando Furlan was
quoted as saying by the local press on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Brazil and Argentina recently raised barriers to their
reciprocal exports. The two countries are the biggest trade
partners of Mercosur, the largest regional trade bloc in South
America which also includes Paraguay and Uruguay.
</P>
<P>
The protectionist measures mutually applied by the two Mercosur
partners are detrimental to the bloc, since they weaken it in its
strategic negotiations, Furlan said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, FIESP president Horacio Lafer also asked to end the
controversy because of the pending Mercosur-European Union
negotiations and the creation of the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA).

<HEADLINE> Chongqing: From Local City To China's Fourth Municipality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Eighty-year-old Zhou
Yonglin is a native of the city of Chongqing but he often
complains that he can get lost whenever he goes out shopping or
just to have a walk.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's complaint is a reflection of the changes that have taken
place in this massive urban area over the past five decades.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing was referred to as the war-time capital by the
Kuomintang Government in 1940, and it made a great contribution to
the War of Resistance to Japan (1937-1945) as a political and
economic center. In the downtown area there is a monument to
victory in that war. For a long time it was the tallest building
in Chongqing, but it's now overshadowed by high-rises or taller
buildings.
</P>
<P>
After New China was founded, Chongqing became a political and
economic center in the southwest. In 1953, the central government
designated it a municipality directly under its jurisdiction. At
that time, the country's first jeep and first seamless steel
tubing and heavy rails were produced here and it was one of China'
s six largest industrial bases.
</P>
<P>
A year later, Chongqing became a city in Sichuan Province and,
by the 1960s and 1970s, large military-industry enterprises had
been moved to Chongqing as part of the State's strategic policies.
</P>
<P>
In 1983, Chongqing took the lead in an overall reform of the
economic system and had a kind of provincial status in managing
its economic affairs. Motor vehicles, metallurgy, and pharmacy
became its three pillar industries.
</P>
<P>
Then, in 1997, Chongqing again became a municipality, China's
fourth, after Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, as an urban area
with a political status similar to that of a province. It covers
an area of 82,300 sq km. and has a population of 30 million, with
40 counties under its administrative control.
</P>
<P>
Changes in Chongqing can in fact be said to epitomize the
country's tremendous changes, according to Prof. Zhou Yong, who
has studied the city for more than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Since 1997, Chongqing has built seven bridges across the
Yangtze and Jiangling rivers and five expressways and has spent 43
billion yuan (5.18 billion U.S. dollars) on some 4,000 km of
highways.
</P>
<P>
With improved infrastructure, Chongqing has become more
attractive to foreign investors. It approved more than 230
overseas-funded enterprises in 1997, with a total of 940 million U.
S. dollars worth of foreign funds. By the next year, 26 of the
world's top 500 enterprises were involved in projects here.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Chongqing is now one of China's major motor vehicle
producers.

<HEADLINE> Watson Wins Legal Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 24 (Xinhua) -- British boxer Michael Watson,
who suffered brain damages during a fight in a world title bout in
1991, won a historic legal battle but his one million pound
damages claim against the British Boxing Board of Control is set
to throw the sport into turmoil.
</P>
<P>
After Justice Ian Kennedy ruled at the High Court in London
that the Board was liable for the boxer's damage incurred in the
fight against Chris Eubank, BBBC's QC, Ronald Walker, said it was
a"landmark decision".
</P>
<P>
"It is the first case in which a regulatory authority has been
held liable for the negligent failure to regulate, resulting in
damages."
</P>
<P>
But 34-year-old Watson's hopes of securing compensation for the
loss of his health and career could be threatened by the
revelation that the Board was uninsured against liability to its
members.
</P>
<P>
The Board's general secretary, John Morris, would not comment
on the suggestion that its finances were in a bad way.
</P>
<P>
He said: "I am not going to go into that. We are a non-profit
making organization, which was set up in 1929 by the will of the
people in boxing to conduct the sport."
</P>
<P>
"If we are not there to do it, then obviously it has to be
controlled.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious matter which will have to be given very
serious consideration."
</P>
<P>
He said that the Board would pursue an appeal even though the
judge refused leave.
</P>
<P>
He added: "The Board has always had considerable sympathy for
Michael Watson following the injuries he sustained in his contest
against Chris Eubank."

<HEADLINE> Opening to World Brings Economic Progress to North China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Shanxi Province in north
China has now actually put to use a total of 2.76 billion U.S.
dollars of foreign funds, about 9 percent of the province's fixed
assets, according to Liu Zhenhua, acting provincial governor.
</P>
<P>
These foreign funds are a major component of the province's
fixed assets investment, and the accumulated foreign investment
from 1992 to 1998 was many times that of the 1978-1988 period.
</P>
<P>
"Great changes have taken place in the province for the past
two decades since the implementation of the country's reform and
opening policy," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Shanxi's gross domestic product (GDP) last
year exceeded 160 billion yuan (19.2 billion U.S. dollars), some
27 times that of 1952, in spite of price rise, and the annual
growth rate of its GDP has remained at an average of 9.8 percent
since 1978.
</P>
<P>
"The opening and reform policy has also provided us an
opportunity to attract foreign investment," he said, adding that
the first regulation issued by the central government on setting
up joint ventures in 1979 offered legal protection to foreign
businesses during their expansion in China.
</P>
<P>
Up to now, the province has approved 1,982 foreign-funded
ventures, offering job opportunities to some 120,000 local people,
and export volume now accounts for 8 percent of the province's
total.
</P>
<P>
Some 42 countries and regions including the United States,
Japan, Singapore, the Republic of Korea (ROK), and Hong Kong and
Taiwan, have invested mainly in quality highway construction, the
electric power industry, and large water conservancy projects,
said Liu.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, agriculture has become another hot area for
investment, with total overseas investment in the last six years
reaching as much as 600 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Eighteen countries and regions, along with a number of
international organizations, have shown their keen interest in the
province's agriculture over the past two years, and investment in
this area now amounts to 960 million yuan (11.52 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Liu went on to say that Shanxi will intensify cooperation with
foreign investors in infrastructure, hi-tech industries,
environmental projects, and agricultural development, and they
will also be encouraged to become involved in the reform of large-
and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, the central government's special attention to
economic growth in the mid-western China in these past few years
has also brought us great opportunities for further development,"
added Liu.
</P>
<P>
Shanxi Province, located in north China, is a typical inland
province hemmed in by mountains. Though rich in mineral resources,
coal in particular, the lack of communication with the outside
hindered it from further development in the past.

MEXICO CITY, September 24 (Xinhua) -- Some 300,000 Mexicans
emigrated to the United States in the last three years, seeking
better opportunities, Mexico's National Migration Institute (INM)
commissioner Alejandro Carrillo Castro said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Mexicans' emigration to the United States dated back decades,
but increased considerably in the last 20 years, Carrillo told the
press in the port city of Veracruz, in the state of the same name,
300 kilometers east of Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
He said that better paid jobs in the United States are the main
attraction for the low-income Mexican labor force.
</P>
<P>
The director of the INM, a branch of the Interior Ministry,
went to Veracruz to take part in the Fifth National Meeting of
Public Administration Institutes.
</P>
<P>
The states which register the biggest exodus of Mexicans to the
United States are, according to Carrillo, Michoacan, Jalisco,
Durango, Zacatecas, and San Luis Potosi.
</P>
<P>
The United States deports thousands of undocumented foreigners,
most of them Mexicans, followed by nationals from Central American
countries.
