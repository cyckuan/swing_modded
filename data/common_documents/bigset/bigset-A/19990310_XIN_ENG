<HEADLINE> Arafat Returns to Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat
returned to Gaza Strip on Tuesday after winding up his two-day
visit to Cairo for consultations with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters upon his arrival, Arafat described his
talks with Mubarak as "positive, important and productive,"
reported the Voice of Palestine (VOP).
</P>
<P>
"I held discussions with President Mubarak on the dangerous
issues concerning the peace process, the declaration of an
independent Palestinian state in May this year and those issues
topped our agenda," Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat did not say that he will definitely declare an
independent Palestinian state in May, but indicated he will
continue consultations with Egypt, the United States and other
Arab nations on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Declaration of an independent Palestinian state is the
Palestinian national rights and only the Palestinian leadership
could make a final decision on this, he said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has insisted that he will declare an independent
Palestinian state on May 4 when the transitional period under the
Oslo accords expires, with or without Israeli consent.
</P>
<P>
But Israel strongly opposed this idea. Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu threatened to stop implementing the signed agreements
with the Palestinians and annex parts of the West Bank if an
independent Palestinian state is declared unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
Nabil Abu Rdeineh, advisor to Arafat, told the VOP that Arafat
received on Monday an important letter from U.S. President Bill
Clinton regarding the latest political developments in the process
and the issue of declaring the Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Rdeineh did not disclose further about the letter, saying the
Palestinian leadership will hold further consultations over this
issue.

<HEADLINE> One-Fourth of Companies Worldwide Unprepared For Millennium Bug </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- One-fourth of all companies worldwide
have so far taken few or no steps to update their computer systems
for coping with the millennium bug, or Y2K problem, a German
research institute affiliated with the computer industry said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Institute of German Economy in Hamburg quoted the
consulting company Cap Gemini as saying that companies throughout
the world will pay 860 billion U.S. dollars to have their computer
system adapted to compensate for the Y2K problem, a software date-
recognition problem prevalent in existing business computer
systems.
</P>
<P>
German companies accounted for about one-tenth of the
unprepared companies, the institute said. Small and medium size
companies without their own computer experts were found to be the
most ill-prepared.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, about half of the small companies
interviewed said they were uncertain about how to prepare the
computer systems against the millennium bug, while only 20 percent
of the companies said they knew how to ensure that their computer
systems would recognize the change from the year 1999 to 2000.
</P>
<P>
In Germany the situation was similar, the institute said.

<P>
TOKYO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Stock prices moved sharply higher in
Tokyo Tuesday, with the key Nikkei index closing above 15,000 for
the first time in more than 13 weeks.
</P>
<P>
The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues on the First
Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange jumped 317.65 points, or 2.15
percent, from Monday's close to end at the day's high of 15,096.70.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time the index closed above 15,000 since

</P>
<P>
The broader-based Tokyo Stock Price Index (TOPIX), covering all
First Section issues rose 14.76 points or 1.29 percent to 1,162.51.
</P>
<P>
Turnover on the major section decreased to 594.84 million

<P>
High-tech issues drove overall stock prices higher, while banks
remained stable after 15 major banks on Monday announced their
restructuring plans, traders said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Still Waits For Libyan Decision on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has not
changed its position on the issue of Lockerbie and "is still
waiting for the Libyan authorities to make a decision" on the
handover of two suspects of the 1988 bombing of an American
airliner, a U.N. Spokesman said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman, told a press conference that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is still contacting relevant parties
to seek a proper solution to the issue.
</P>
<P>
Annan has said that Libya should be given a period of time to
think over, and he did not specify the time into days and months,
Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman made the remarks after Libyan leader Muammar
Gaddafi has said last week that "a final agreement is expected" on
arrangements for the trial of two suspects, Al-Amin Khalifa Fahima
and Abdel Basset al-Megrahi.
</P>
<P>
At issue is the surrender of the two suspects to the Scottish
court in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Annan said that he has given "all explanations and
clarifications" to Tripoli, and the next step is up to the Libyan
authorities to make an official decision on the Lockerbie trial.
</P>
<P>
The two Libyans were accused of involvement in the December
1988 bombing of a Pan Am airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland, which
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The United States and Britain gave Tripoli an informal 30-day
deadline on February 26 to surrounder them to the Scottish court
in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
In last August, Libya has accepted a U.S.-UK offer to have the
two suspects tried before a Scottish court under the Scottish law
in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
Libya has asked the United Nations for a series of guarantees,
including a U.N. pledge that the sanctions, imposed in 1992 for
the Libyan failure to hand over the two suspects, be lifted,
rather than being simply suspended.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Blast Damages Nazi Crime Exhibition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A bomb exploded Tuesday in the city
of Saarbruecken, damaging a controversial exhibition on war crimes
of the Nazi armed force.
</P>
<P>
No one died or injured in the explosion, which took place at
4:40 a.m. (0340 GMT), but windows and window frames of the
exhibition building and an adult training school were blown out.
</P>
<P>
Windows of a nearby church were also shattered by the blast,
and the damages were estimated at several hundred thousand
Deutsche marks (over 100,000 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The organizers closed the exhibition after the explosion while
police bomb experts sifted through the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
Local police said in a statement the attack was apparently the
work of extremist opponents of the show, and the bomb appeared to
have been set professionally on a rear wall of the building.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, titled "War of Extermination: Crimes of the
Wehrmacht from 1941 to 1944," has aroused strong protest from
German neo-Nazis and World War II veterans.
</P>
<P>
Opponents say the exhibition is one-sided and tars all 20
million German World War II soldiers as war criminals.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, concentrating on brutal crimes of the German
armed force Wehrmacht in Belarus, Ukraine and Serbia, was funded
by a Hamburg businessman.

SOFIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- NATO is transporting its military
supplies and gear to Macedonia via Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Defense
Ministry confirmed on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The NATO supplies, which are coming from Hungary, do not
include weapons, or the transportation would have to be authorized
by parliament, the 24 Hours newspaper quoted the ministry as
saying.

<P>
Residents in the northwest of the country have recently seen
NATO trucks "secretly passing by" at night, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian customs officials also found some NATO trucks
transporting tents and other supplies over the Bulgarian-
Macedonian border a week ago, it added.
</P>
<P>
On February 25, the Bulgarian government agreed to provide a
ground corridor and logistical aid to NATO troops. The final
validation should be approved by the Bulgarian parliament.

<HEADLINE> No Breakthrough for N.Irish Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The talks between Northern
Ireland's First Minister David Trimble and Sinn Fein President
Gerry Adams ended Tuesday with no breakthrough in the deadlocked
peace process in the province.
</P>
<P>
But after the meeting in Belfast, Trimble said he was
"confident" the Good Friday peace agreement would go ahead,
according to BBC reports from the provincial capital.
</P>
<P>
"I'm also confident about what will ultimately happen, namely
that this process will succeed," said Trimble, also the leader of
the pro-British Ulster Unionist Party.
</P>
<P>
Adams said both sides would nonetheless meet again. "The delay
has not been helpful and unless people assert themselves to
fulfill the agreement then the people who voted on this island for
changes on this island are going to be the people who are sorely
disappointed."
</P>
<P>
The failure to overcome the obstacle of decommissioning of
paramilitary weapons has forced the British government to postpone
the creation of a ruling executive for the assembly for three
weeks until March 29.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein has consistently blamed unionists for the delay,
saying that they are deliberately using decommissioning to hold up
the implementation of the Good Friday agreement.
</P>
<P>
Unionists counter that they will not sit on an executive while
republican paramilitaries still retain the threat of force and
have made no effort to hand over even a token quantity of weapons.
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam also met Sinn Fein Tuesday
morning in a fresh attempt to break the deadlock in the peace
process, but it was inconclusive.

<HEADLINE> EU to Improve Relations With Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said here
Tuesday that it intends to make a qualitative improvement in its
relations with Latin America (LA) and give a fresh impetus to
political, economic and trade cooperation between the two regions.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the EU's executive body, has finalized
a policy document on this subject. The commission said in a
statement that the document aims to set out the main themes for
reflection relating to future EU-LA relations before a summit in
Rio de Janeiro on June 28-29.
</P>
<P>
The summit will for the first time bring together the heads of
state and government of the EU, LA and the Caribbean countries,
the commission said.
</P>
<P>
The policy document defines the converging lines of action
centered around three main pillars of EU-LA relations: political,
economic and commercial cooperation, said a commission
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
EU-LA relations have developed through three stages: priority
on development cooperation, moves to foster economic partnership,
and the present stage, which is rooted in a regional approach and
observance of democratic principles and human rights.
</P>
<P>
The 15-nation EU adopted a strategy in 1995 to strengthen this
partnership in the period 1996-2000 in a way that took account of
the diversity of LA. The EU has devised a partnership system based
on dialogue with the various regional subgroups and a range of
instruments geared to the political and socio-economic
circumstances of each, said the commission, the EU's law proposing
and enforcing arm.

<HEADLINE> EU Says No Unilateral Action in Banana War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) said
Tuesday that it will not take unilateral action in the banana row
with the United States and will do everything within the World
Trade Organization system.
</P>
<P>
When asked if the EU is preparing to take counter measures
against U.S. exports to Europe, European Commission spokesman
Nigel Gardner told reporters that the EU will play entirely by
international rules.
</P>
<P>
"There is no question of us going down this route to illegal
unilateral sanctions such as United States has done," Gardner said
at a news briefing. "But what we will do is to use every possible
route within the World Trade Organization to try to get a solution.
"
</P>
<P>
Gardner's comments came after WTO members gathered Monday to
discuss the escalation of the EU-U.S. trade war over bananas.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting of the 134-member WTO in Geneva, the EU called
for a denunciation of the United States for unilaterally imposing
520 million U.S. dollars in imports duties on European products.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move is reportedly designed to compensate for losses
allegedly suffered by American banana-marketing companies as a
result of the EU's revised banana import policy.
</P>
<P>
Gardner said the EU is trying to resolve the dispute amicably,
and "we are trying to make an effort with the United States to
make some kind of solution, because we don't believe the present
situation is in anybody's interests."
</P>
<P>
"The problem is what the United States has done with the
unilateral action has actually made it harder to solve this matter,
" he said.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to win a WTO panel, we will be in the position to
seek authorized compensation, that is the legal compensation, not
the illegal action in the way the United States behaved last week,
" the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
"If we were to lose, we would change our system, and bring it
to comply with whatever the WTO asks us to do," Gardner said,
adding that he believed the revised EU banana regime is entirely
in line with the bloc's international obligations.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls on Washington to Pay U.N. Dues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday called upon the U.S. government to pay its back
dues, saying that "only Washington can solve it."
</P>
<P>
In an address to the national convention of the United Nations
Association (UNA) of the United States of America, Annan said the
issue of the U.S. arrears "is not with the citizens, but with the
leaders -- not with the people, but with politicians."
</P>
<P>
"I have spent too much time with ordinary Americans -- in UNA
chapters and elsewhere -- to blame them for their government's
inability to honor its obligations to the United Nations," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The problem is in Washington, and only Washington can solve
it," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Over the last two years, I have sought to convince Washington
of the need to put the issue of the U.S. arrears behind us, once
and for all -- above all, for Washington's own sake," he said.
</P>
<P>
"But ultimately, it is not for me or any United Nations
Secretary-General to convince a Member State to fulfill its
obligations under the (U.N.) Charter," he said. "It is for each
Member State's government, citizens and civil society to make this
happen."
</P>
<P>
Since he became the first black to head the world body in 1997,
Annan has paid several visits to Washington, persuading the U.S.
government and congressional leaders into paying the back dues,
which currently totals some 1.7 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Annan also, in an open and repeated manner, lashed out at the
U.S. for its reluctance to solve the problem by honoring its
obligations.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. long-standing unwillingness to pay up its arrears has
plunged the 185-member organization into financial crisis and
limited the U.N. ability to meet the challenges in the maintenance
of peace and security in the world at large.
</P>
<P>
The UNA has over the past years strengthened its partnership
ties with the United Nations by raising public awareness in the
U.S. of the importance of the United Nations in today's world, and
made painstaking efforts to urge the U.S. government to pay its
back dues.
</P>
<P>
"What you can do, and have done effectively and energetically
over the years, is to inform, educate and enlighten your fellow
Americans about the promise and performance of the United
Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever you speak up and speak out for the United Nations,
you are ensuring that America's role in the United Nations of
the next century will be as vital as it has been in the century
we are about to leave," Annan added.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- About 4,000 children in the
refugee camps in central Angola's Huambo City are in urgent need
of food, the official Angolan News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The children, in bad sanitary condition and urgent need of food
and clothing, are part of the nearly 100,000 refugees who flocked
into the city after the re-eruption of the war by the end of last
year, Abel Chico, official in charge of the refugee camps in
Huambo said.
</P>
<P>
Though battles around Huambo have come to an end, the
government forces are still engaged in war against the rebel
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) in the
northern part of the Huambo Province, so many people are still
living in the refugee camps around the city.
</P>
<P>
Most of the refugees are malnourished, with only one meal a day
and most of them are suffering from malaria and dysentery, Chico
said.
</P>
<P>
With the coming of winter, many of the children, without enough
to wear, may find it hard to survive the cold days, the official
said.
</P>
<P>
It is said that there are more than two million refugees in
the country since the re-eruption of war in the southern African
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) has airlifted medical supplies and a medical team to an area
in Afghanistan hit by an influenza-like illness, reported the
Associated Press of Pakistan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The disease outbreaking in January has affected a large
proportion of the people of Darwaz District in Northern Afghan
province of Badakhshan and claimed more than 300 lives.
</P>
<P>
The WHO has sent their medicines to the village of Jamarche
Bala where 61 deaths occurred last month among a population of
about 5400 affected by the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
According to the organization, the medical supplies consist of
antibiotics for children and adults to treat the secondary
complications which are causing the excess mortality in this
outbreak.
</P>
<P>
Health personnel are accompanying the supplies distributed to
the affected area and will stay about four weeks because there are
currently no basic health facilities in the whole district of
Darwaz, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Medical and investigation teams have also been sent by road by
the Tajikistan Ministry of Health and the Red Cross/Crescent and a
number of Non-Governmental Organizations.
</P>
<P>
Two epidemiologist from WHO investigated the outbreak in Darwaz
District on February 26-28 and reported their clinical impression
that it is an influenza-Like illness that has secondary
complications, mainly pneumonia, with high excess mortality due to
of lack of treatment and overall poor living and nutritional
conditions, said the report.

<HEADLINE> UN Agency Warns of Possible World Recession </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Another round of financial
instability like that in Asia and Brazil could push an already
fragile world economy into recession, said the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
This is the conclusion of a UNCTAD-sponsored report on global
economic conditions and prospects, which was recently presented to
the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN).
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that avoiding such an outcome required
"vigilance on the part of policy makers in the industrial
countries where there remains considerable scope and freedom for
expansionary policy actions."
</P>
<P>
"Just when developing countries are becoming increasingly
vulnerable to international pressures originating in the North,
there remains a general reluctance to accommodate their concerns
and interests," the UNCTAD complained.
</P>
<P>
The UNCTAD called on the developed countries to take a more
imaginative approach such as writing off debt owed by the
developing countries, carrying out regional aid plans, and
injecting liquidity directly to developing countries and
transition economies.
</P>
<P>
"Global economic performance in 1999 will depend, to a large
extent, on the willingness of capital markets to place funds at
risk in emerging markets as well as on the extent of risk aversion
and instability in capital markets within developed economies, in
particular the United States and Japan," said the report.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Election Commission of Nepal
decided Tuesday to hold the election to the House of
Representatives in two phases respectively on May 3 and May 17,
Nepali Television said.
</P>
<P>
Voting will be first held in 36 districts and then in the
remaining 39 districts, the state-run television said.
</P>
<P>
Vote counting will be conducted only after the conclusion of
the second phase voting, it said.
</P>
<P>
The army will be mobilized to man the ballot boxes as the
police force is inadequate, the Election Commission said.
</P>
<P>
It said the number of political parties registered with it has
reached 96.
</P>
<P>
All the political parties except the ruling Nepali Congress
oppose phase-wise polls. They favor polls in one single day on May
3 as announced by King Birendra when he dissolved the house on
January 15.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxism-Leninism, CPN-UML)
and the Nepal Sadbhavana Party, the ruling partners of the Nepali
Congress, have ruled out the possibility of boycotting the polls.
</P>
<P>
But the Communist Party of Nepal (Marxism-Leninism, CPN-ML) has
threatened to do so.

<HEADLINE> EU Clears Leisure Travel Joint Venture in UK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission said here
Tuesday that it has given a green light to a new joint venture in
Britain's leisure travel sector which will combine the package
holiday activities of the Thomas Cook Group and of Carlson Leisure
Group Ltd (UK).
</P>
<P>
The commission, the European Union's executive body, said the
new company, Thomas Cook Holdings Ltd, will be under the joint
control of the German credit institution Westdeutsche Landesbank,
the German conglomerate Preussag and the privately owned U.S.
travel company Carlson.
</P>
<P>
Thomas Cook Holdings Ltd will be a vertically integrated
leisure travel company, supplying foreign package holidays to
British consumers using its own chain of travel agencies.
</P>
<P>
The new joint venture's shares of the tour operator, travel
agency, and charter airline markets in Britain are not such as to
cause competition concerns and would be smaller than those of some
of its competitors. Therefore the commission, the watchdog for
enforcing EU legislation, said it decided not to oppose the
concentration.

<HEADLINE> Uganda, Rwanda to Cooperate in Electricity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Rwanda and Uganda are exploring
the possibility of cooperation in the energy sector, by way of
exchanging electric power supplies.
</P>
<P>
This cooperation was announced Monday by the Rwandan Minister
of Public Works and Communication, Vincent Biruta, following a
meeting with the Ugandan Minister of Energy Richard Kaijuka, the
Rwanda News Agency reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
It is said that Rwanda will put up a new power transmission
line connecting it to Uganda, and will easy power export between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Kaijuka said that Rwanda and Uganda have agreed on setting up a
"joint technical committee" to make a survey about requirements
for putting up the power inter-connectivity to Uganda's power
grid.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan official declared Uganda produces a lot of
electricity, but at present, it is experiencing much deficits. But
beginning with the year 2, 000, a new dam extension at Jinja will
have a capacity to produce 200 mega watts, which will add to its
2,000 mega watts originally produced.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that an American company is constructing a power
dam at Bujagali falls, 11 kms north of Jinja on Nile River, which
will have a capacity of producing 250 mega watts.
</P>
<P>
For Kayijuka, the inter-connection of power is to ensure a firm
 partnership of power supply in the future to curb power shortages
between the two countries.

<HEADLINE> Progress made in Africa's Economic Management: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Senior World Bank official Alan
Gelb said here Tuesday that it is heartening to note that Africans
are making significant changes in terms of economic management.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Zimbabwe News Agency, Gelb said that
a lot of progress has been made by Africans in macro-economic
management between 1992 and 1997 with deficits falling from about
six percent of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to two percent
including grants.
</P>
<P>
About 31 countries realized economic growth rates of between
four and five percent from 1995 to 1997 due to sound economic
management, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gelb, the World Bank's chief economist for Africa, said that
African economies had become much more open.
</P>
<P>
They should maintain a five percent growth rate in revenue to
reduce poverty which has been worsened by population increase, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Africa's population growth rate stands at 2.8 percent per
annum.
</P>
<P>
Gelb also said governments must improve effectiveness in
economic management by supplying more information and presenting
opportunities to the civic society.
</P>
<P>
He, however, said most African countries had realized minimal
economic growth to due wars and unfavorable business environments
which scared off investors.
</P>
<P>
He said that over 20 countries on the continent were engaged in
war or experienced some disturbances.
</P>
<P>
"The environment is still not favorable that businesses see
high risks in investing in Africa and regulation costs are too
high. It is costly and time consuming to establish a business
here," said Gelb.
</P>
<P>
Geld said the killer AIDS was also causing untold economic
problems to Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The cost of caring for an AIDS patient is about the same as
educating 10 children in primary school," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has become the 44th
African country to join the Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).
</P>
<P>
This was announced here Tuesday by International Banks
Communication Vice-President of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia,
Eshetu Fantaye. He said eight Ethiopian banks have become
beneficiaries of SWIFT as of March 7, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Eshetu said efforts to join SWIFT started in 1993. "Thanks to
the liberalization of the economy and the deregulation in the
communication and tax regime of the economy, the actual planning
of the implementation of SWIFT began in Ethiopia in 1998 with the
establishment of an interbank SWIFT committee," he added.
</P>
<P>
SWIFT, which is a huge knowledge based Interbank Financial
Message Network, gives services to over 6,500 financial
institutions in 178 countries.

<HEADLINE> Eritrea Reiterates Committment to Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Woldensae said hereTuesday evening that his government is ready to
hold negotiations with Ethiopia without any conditions.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to hold negotiation with Ethiopia at any time, in
any place and at any level," Haile told diplomats in Asmara.
</P>
<P>
In response to Ethiopia's doubts of Eritrea's acceptance of the
 framework agreement by the Organization of African Unity (OAU),
Haile said that the Eritrean government is committed to an
immediate cease-fire, cessation of hostilities and the
implementation of the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Eritrean government has set up a high-level
body fully mandated to initiate and finalize the implementation of
the provisions of the OAU framework agreement.
</P>
<P>
Haile said that Eritrea has withdrawn its troops from the
disputed town of Badme and the areas around the town as required
by the 11-pointed framework put forward by the OAU, he added.
</P>
<P>
However, Ethiopia demanded that Eritrean troops withdraw from
all the " occupied areas" other than Badme and its environs.
</P>
<P>
Eritrea accepted the OAU plan on February 27 when the
Ethiopians celebrated a "total victory" in Badme, a rocky
390-square-kilometer patch of land southwest of Eritrean capital
Asmara.
</P>
<P>
The Ethiopia News Agency quoted Prime Minister Meles Zenawi as
saying Monday that Eritrean forces are still making efforts to
reinforce their trenches along the Ethiopian territories they
occupied by force in May last year and dispatching additional
troops to these areas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Eritrean foreign minister said : "Fighting is
still going on in Mereb-Setit all the time." He asked the OAU,
the United Nations Security Council, the European Union and the
United States to urge Ethiopia to stop fighting and implement the
peace agreement.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Optimistic on EU Accession Course </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot government spokesman
Christos Stylianides on Tuesday said that Cyprus' accession to
the European Union (EU) is on a good course.
</P>
<P>
He described as "very constructive" the talks with German envoy
to Cyprus Detlev Graf Rantzau, who arrived here on Sunday for a
five-day visit, on Cyprus' EU accession and the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus submitted an application for EU membership in July 1990
and the accession process was launched in Brussels on March 30,
1998.
</P>
<P>
Rantzau, whose country is holding a six-month rotating EU
presidency, said earlier that he did not bring any ideas or
proposals on the Cyprus issue and noted there is no planned
initiative on confidence building measures, as far as he knew.
</P>
<P>
But diplomatic source here said that Germany intends to
involve directly in the efforts to solve the Cyprus issue.
</P>
<P>
The source also said that Germany will present a concrete
formula to the two communities in Cyprus regarding the Cyprus
issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
in the wake of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has been trying for decades to reunite the island but
so far no tangible results have been achieved.

<HEADLINE> Britain Cuts Company Tax To All-Time Low </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- British Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown cut corporation tax from 31 percent to 30 percent
from 1 April in an effort to boost UK business -- the lowest rate
in history.
</P>
<P>
Making his annual budget proposals to parliament Tuesday, Brown
also cut the rate of tax for small companies from 23 percent to 20
percent. A total of 350,000 companies will benefit.
</P>
<P>
"This is a budget built on the central idea that our future
depends on enterprise and fairness together," Brown told
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Companies will also receive research and development support.
The government will underwrite almost a third of research and
development costs for small businesses.
</P>
<P>
The chancellor said that a Small Business Service, devoted to
helping small companies, will be established.
</P>
<P>
The service will offer loan guarantees, support innovation,
advise on electronic commerce and provide an automated payroll
service to help new small companies starting out.
</P>
<P>
As far as income tax is concerned, Brown said he would
introduce a long-promised 10 percent starting rate of income tax.
</P>
<P>
The tax rate would also be introduced in April, and apply to
the first 1,500 pounds (2,418 U.S. dollars) of taxable income, he
added.
</P>
<P>
"The tax cuts I have made today are tax cuts for a purpose, tax
cuts that encourage work and make work pay, that help all middle
and lower income families," he said.

<HEADLINE> UN Okays Additional 4 Deals on Iraq's Oil Spare Parts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
Sanctions Committee had approved an additional four contracts for
Iraq's oil industry spare parts and equipment in the past week,
the U.N. Office of the Iraq Program (OIP) said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The OIP said two of these had earlier been placed on hold, and
the total number of contracts approved so far is 386 worth of
229,490,496 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The OIP said the number of contracts received last week is six
for a total of 1,694,129 dollars, and two more contracts were put
on hold.
</P>
<P>
The OIP said there are 93 contracts on hold worth 27,958,439
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The oil-for-food program which went into effect in December
1996, has increased the amount of oil Iraq is allowed to export
from 2 billion dollars to 5.2 billion dollars in every six months.
</P>
<P>
But with a dilapidated oil industry and low oil prices, Iraq
could only export no more than 3 billion dollars worth of oil
every six months.
</P>
<P>
Under the current phase, Iraq is allowed to import 300 million
dollars worth of spare parts and equipment to improve its oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has accused the United States and Britain of blocking
contracts for spare parts and equipment.

<HEADLINE> Annan Hails Congo (K) Decision to Stop Fighting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan Tuesday hailed a decision by warring Congo (K) parties to
stop fighting to pave the way for the U.N. efforts to carry out an
urgently needed polio immunization campaign in the Central African
country.
</P>
<P>
A statement, issued here through his spokesman, said, "The
Secretary-General welcomes the assurances by the parties to the
conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to stop
fighting and allow the World Health Organization and the United
Nations Children's Fund to carry out an urgently needed polio
immunization campaign in that Central African country."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General also extends his full support to the
initiative, which the heads of the two agencies described in a
joint letter to him as the single highest priority for global
polio eradication," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In order to immunize some 10 million children under the age of
five throughout the DRC, a respite in fighting or a series of
truces called `days of tranquillity' will need to be negotiated,"
said the statement. "The campaign is slated for later this year."
</P>
<P>
"The Secretary-General was heartened by President Laurent
Kabila's public commitment to support polio eradication. He is
also encouraged by the commitment of the Chairman of the Congolese
Rally for Democracy to facilitate the implementation of the
so-called National Immunization Days in rebel-held territory," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
"He trusts that both parties and their allies will do all that
is necessary to provide the peaceful and secure environment needed
for this campaign," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Sergio
Vieira de Mello has been designated to coordinate the support that
this vital initiative requires, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebels are fighting the government troops in a
bid to topple President Kabila, who came to power after the defeat
of former ruler Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Also drawn into the current Congo (K) conflict are Zimbabwe,
Angola and Namibia on the government side, with Sudan and Chad
joining in some fighting for the government.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Rwanda and Uganda support Congolese rebels,
many of whom are ethnic Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Accuses U.S., Britain of Impeding Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Tuesday accused the
U.S. and British governments of impeding the approval of
electricity and drinking water contracts it signed with foreign
companies.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. and British administrations are going on, using all
means, with committing genocide against Iraq's children, women
and the elderly," said an Iraqi Trade Ministry source, requesting
anonymity.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and British administrations started their
anti-Iraq policy from 1990 by imposing harsh embargoes on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"They are continuing their policy accompanied by ceaseless
military aggressions, by impeding the approval of electricity and
drinking water contracts, with the objective of expanding the
effective influence of shortages of drinking water and
electricity," he added.
</P>
<P>
The source said most of the electricity and water contracts of
the fourth and fifth phases of the oil-for-food program had not
been approved.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. and British representatives in the
U.N. Sanctions Committee also blocked the approval of
prerequisites of storing grain and production of flour and
vehicles of tranferring the foodstuff to all provinces of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The source said the total recorded contracts in the fifth phase
of the oil-for-food deal which started last November amounted to
904 million dollars, of which 340 million U.S. dollars worth of
contracts had not been approved yet.
</P>
<P>
Some 122 million dollars worth of eletricity contracts have
not been approved in the fourth and fifth phases, said the
source, adding the 39 contracts of water and sewage that
were blocked in the two said phases are worth of 67 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
He added that 142 contracts concerning education, agriculture,
medicine, irrigation and foodstuff have not been approved.
</P>
<P>
The aim behind blocking the approval of those contracts by the
U.S. and British representatives was to hamper the procurement of
materials and requirement capable of meeting the Iraqis' virtual
needs, he added.
</P>
<P>
The source stressed that Iraq condemned such hostile policy
which was inconsistent with human rights, saying the oil-for-food
program had failed to alleviate the Iraqis' suffering due to the
harsh U.N. sanctions imposed on Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Slashes Prices of Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- International computer software
giant Microsoft Tuesday said it has slashed the prices of all its
products in Zimbabwe, Zambia and Malawi by 35 percent to offset
the effects of devalued currencies in the respective countries.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft Zimbabwe business development manager Rodwell Zvarayi
Tuesday told the Zimbabwe News Agency that the move had been
authorized by the parent company in the United States and became
effective on March 1, applying to all products on sale.
</P>
<P>
"Our partners in the sales channel, made up of distributors and
 resellers, are being informed of this decision and we expect them
to pass on the price reduction to end users," he said.
</P>
<P>
Currencies in southern African countries have fallen
significantly against the greenback in the past two years, causing
prices of imported goods including computer software to rise.
</P>
<P>
"This gesture is meant to help users in Zimbabwe, Zambia and
Malawi to remain up to date in software installed on their
computers despite the effects of local inflation and rising cost
of living," he said.
</P>
<P>
Last month the computer software company reported that more
than 100,000 counterfeit Microsoft software units had been shipped
to southern Africa and were expected to be sold on the black
market at very cheap rates.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the move to reduced prices is likely meant to
counter the growing use of pirated software in the region.

BAGHDAD, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. and British warplanes
bombed some military sites and civilian facilities in northern
Iraq on Tuesday, an Iraqi military spokesman announced.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi News Agency INA quoted the spokesman as saying
that 10 formations of enemy planes coming from a Turkish
military base violated northern Iraqi airspace at 11:10 a.m.
local time (0810 GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman added these enemy planes made 20 sorties over
the provinces of Dohuk, Erbil and Mosul.
</P>
<P>
He said those planes bombed some military sites and civilian
facilities in Neineva province, adding Iraqi air defenses
repulsed the enemy planes and forced them to flee to their base
in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman did not say whether the U.S. and British
bombing led to casualties or not.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between Iraqi air defenses and U.S. and British jets
patrolling the no-fly zones have almost become a daily occurrence
since the U.S.-British air strikes on Iraq in mid-December.
</P>
<P>
The no-fly zones were imposed by the U.S.-led western
allies following the 1991 Gulf War with a claimed aim of
protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite Muslims in
the south from what they called "Baghdad's suppression."

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean President Consults with Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah Tuesday held talks here with Nigerian leaders on the future
of the west African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG in that country.
</P>
<P>
The visit to Nigeria by the Sierra Leonean president who
arrived here Monday night was reportedly aimed at consulting on
the best way forward for his country embroiled in conflicts
between the Kabbah government and the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Before Kabbah's arrival, Nigerian President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo said during his presidential campaign that his
administration would not hesitate to pull out Nigeria's troops
from Sierra Leone, who form the bulk of the ECOMOG force in that
country.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar also said
that his government planned to withdraw the Nigerian troops
serving in the ECOMOG force in Sierra Leone before May 29
hand-over of power to a democratically- elected government.
</P>
<P>
During the talks between Kabbah and General Abubakar, the
Nigerian government was believed to explain its new position to
President Kabbah and encourage him to hold immediate dialog with
rebel leader Foday Sankoh with a view to find a lasting solution
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
President Kabbah is expected to hold talks with President-elect
Obasanjo before his departure for home.
</P>
<P>
Before flying to Nigeria, Kabbah met with Togolese President
Gnassingbe Eyadema, chairman of the Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS), in the northern town of Lamakara which
may serve as a neutral ground for the proposed talks between
Kabbah and the rebels led by Sankoh.
</P>
<P>
Rebel leader Sankoh Tuesday gave orders to his forces to
observe a ceasefire within 72 hours and to release all hostages
held by the rebels in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Sankoh told reporters that he would soon be leaving for Togo to
meet his rebel commanders and discuss an agenda for peace talks
with President Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Last week, President Kabbah announced that the rebel leader
could travel to Togo to meet other commanders of his forces.
</P>
<P>
The president gave his permission for Sankoh to travel after
the rebels said they would observe a ceasefire if they were
allowed a meeting with their leader.

<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Qatari Foreign Minister Hamad
Bin Jassim Bin Jabir al-Thani on Tuesday called for an end to the
U.S. and British air strikes on Iraq, the official Qatari News
Agency (QNA) said.
</P>
<P>
The Qatari minister said at a joint news conference with
visiting U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen after their talks in
Doha that his country opposed such military action.
</P>
<P>
"We do not wish to see Iraq being bombed daily in the two
no-fly zones," Hamad said.
</P>
<P>
He said Qatar was concerned about the sufferings of the Iraq
people, and expressed hope that these sufferings would end as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he stressed that Iraq must abide by the United
Nations resolutions.
</P>
<P>
The minister admitted Qatar's difference with the United States
on the Iraq issue, but added the main issue is how to bring peace
and stability in this region.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who had visited Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman and the
United Arab Emirates before arriving in Qatar, emphasized
U.S. stance that the strikes would continue as long as Iraq
threatens U.S. planes patrolling the no-fly zones.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and its western allies imposed two no-fly zones in
Iraq after the 1991 Gulf War claimedly to protect the Kurds in the
north and the Shiite Muslims in the south from Baghdad's
suppression.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad refused to recognize the restricted zones and vowed to
fire at any war planes violating its airspace. Clashes between
Iraqi air defense and U.S. and British planes occurred nearly
everyday.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, who is on a Gulf tour on defense affairs, left Qatar for
Kuwait later Tuesday, where he visited U.S. pilots at a desert
air-base, reports said.

However, the leading index was still short of the 78.5 points

LUANDA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Angolan government has accepted
Zambia's proposal to entrust the U.S. experts to investigate the
bombing of Angolan embassy in Lusaka at the end of last month,
state radio reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Angola's term for the investigations is to send a delegation to
oversee the whole investigation process, which Zambia has agreed,
the radio quoted a source at Angolan foreign ministry as saying.

Describing the nature of a series of explosions in Zambian
capital Lusaka on February 28 as very complex, Zambia has

incident, the source said.

One of the explosions took place in the Angolan embassy in
Lusaka, killing one security guard and damaged embassy buildings.
Angola made strong reactions to the bombing incident demanding
Zambia to promptly give explanations.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the relationship between Angola and Zambia has
worsened as the Angolan government time and again accused Zambia
of supplying weapons and logistical support to the National Union
for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), an anti-government
force. The Zambian government has flatly denied the allegations.

The two officials also discussed, during a banquet hosted by

<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Coordinator for Cyprus
Thomas Miller hinted here Tuesday that Washington is putting
pressure on Greece to compromise with Turkey on the Kurdish issue.
</P>
<P>
Following his talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem
and other senior officials, Miller said that "There is absolutely
no doubt that we consider the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party
(PKK) to be a terrorist group and we consider the PKK leader
Abdullah Ocalan to be a terrorist."
</P>
<P>
The tension between Turkey and Greece escalated after Ocalan
was captured by Turkish special agents after he left the residence
of Greek ambassador in Nairobi in mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was then brought to a jail on Imrali Island in Marmara
Sea near Turkey's western province of Bursa and is formally
charged with treason.
</P>
<P>
His guerrilla group has been fighting since 1984 a war for an
independent Kurdish state in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Turkey, accusing Greece and Cyprus of supporting and sheltering
the PKK, has demanded them to cut all links with its and to
publicly condemn it as a terrorist organization.
</P>
<P>
Miller affirmed that the PKK issue would be on his agenda at
his next stops in Athens and Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
"The PKK is an extremely important issue and in any
conversation I am in, wherever I am, it comes up," he said.

could take military action against Greece if it continues to

ASMARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile
Woldensae said here Tuesday evening that his government respects
the Organization of African Unity (OAU).
</P>
<P>
"We did not say that the OAU could not resolve problems,"
Woldensae told foreign diplomats in Asmara, in response to some
reports.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, one diplomat noted there were reports claiming that
Eritrea had said the OAU was not a strong body.
</P>
<P>
Woldensae pointed out that his country wants the OAU to be
"effective and efficient."
</P>
<P>
He added that Eritrea has only expressed its concern and its
view as many countries would do the same watching on the reform of
the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the Eritrean government has
accepted the 11-point framework agreement put forward by the OAU,
based in Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.
</P>
<P>
If it doesn't respect the OAU, Eritrea would not joint the
body, Woldensae said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU, together with the United Nations, the European Union
and some countries, welcomed Eritrea's acceptance of the peace
plan.
</P>
<P>
Woldensae also expressed his government's commitment to an
immediate cease-fire, cessation of hostilities and the
implementation of the peace plan as called by the OAU and the
United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Eritrea has unilaterally withdrawn its troops
from the disputed town of Badme and the areas around the town as
required by the 11- pointed framework put forward by the OAU.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that the Eritrean government has also
 established a high-level body fully mandated to initiate and
finalize the implementation of the provisions of the OAU framework
agreement.

<HEADLINE> S. African Politicians Condemn Pre-Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- South African political
leaders on Tuesday condemned the latest spate of politically
motivated killings in Cape Town and called for tolerance ahead of
the general elections in June.
</P>
<P>
A member of the opposition United Democratic Movement (UDM) was
shot dead Tuesday in Nyanga, Cape Town. He was the fourth UDM
member who has been killed in the area since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The area has been tense since the murder on Sunday of a city
councillor of the ruling African National Congress (ANC) and a UDM
politician. Another two UDM members died in a hail of bullets
Monday in the Nyanga/KTC area.
</P>
<P>
Although Tuesday's killing was witnessed by several residents
in Nyanga, they were reluctant to talk to police for fear of
reprisal, South African state television reported.
</P>
<P>
Malizole Diko, the UDM secretary in the Western Cape Province,
where Cape Town is located, said some ANC members attacked him
earlier Tuesday in his house in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
He said the ANC people would have killed him if his bodyguards
had not been present.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the killings, UDM deputy leader Roelf Meyer Tuesday
called for political tolerance ahead of the second democratic
election in June.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said as his party had made significant inroads into some
of the ANC's power bases and tensions in these areas were growing,
the current incidents were not totally unexpected.
</P>
<P>
But he said he is confident this is not going to be the
pattern, and the situation would be brought under control if all
political parties join hands in curbing the violence.
</P>
<P>
UDM provincial chairman Johan Slabbert, in an open letter to
the provincial leaders of the ANC, the National Party and several
other opposition parties, said his party leaders have been the
targets of assassins since January.
</P>
<P>
A prominent UDM politician was gunned down in January in the
KwaZulu- Natal Province, and 13 ANC members were murdered the
following day in the same area in what was believed to be a
revenge attack.
</P>
<P>
Slabbert said this "systematic campaign" was reminiscent of a
similar campaign to eliminate Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leaders
in KwaZulu-Natal prior to the 1994 elections.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign Ministers of
Indonesia and Portugal will hold talks as scheduled in New York on
Wednesday on East Timor, it was announced here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
But senior officials from the two countries, who had been
scheduled to meet Tuesday, will postpone their discussions till
Wednesday morning, United Nations spokesman Manoel de Almeida e
Silva told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's U.N. mission asked for the delay as its delegation
is due to arrive Tuesday afternoon, Almeida e Silva said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have been engaged in U.N. sponsored talks on
a wide-ranging autonomy of East Timor for quite a long time.
</P>
<P>
The autonomy package had been expected to be announced at this
week's meetings, but analysts say they still wait and see what
would happen.
</P>
<P>
The two countries will tackle the issue of the autonomy package
and "the methodology for ascertaining the views of the Timorese on
the autonomy package" at this week's talks, said U.N. spokesman
Fred Eckhard.
</P>
<P>
Previous reports said Indonesia would let East Timor enjoy
autonomy except for defense, foreign affairs and finance. It said
if the people on the island prefer independence, Indonesia would
not object, ruling out a referendum for fear of leading to
violence.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000 and an area of
15,000 square kilometers, had been a Portuguese colony until 1975.
It became an Indonesian province in 1976.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Exports Skilled Labors to Ease Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government will send
more skilled labors to work overseas this year to help alleviate
the deteriorating unemployment problems at home, Labor and Social
Welfare Minister Sompong Amornvivat said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Sompong said that his ministry was laying out plans to promote
employment of skilled Thai workers in the United States, Japan and
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The ministry planned to send some 200,000 skilled workers this
year, up from 10,000 workers last year.
</P>
<P>
The plan of export skilled workers abroad is part of the
ministry's promotion campaign, which is expected to cut the number
of jobless by more than 1.5 million.
</P>
<P>
As many as 2.68 million people are believed to be out of work
in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Sompong said the ministry has asked the United States, during
Secretary of State Madeline Albright's recent visit, to employ
more skilled workers such as computer programmers and accountants
from Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Each year, the United States offers up to 120,000 job vacancies
for overseas workers.
</P>
<P>
In Japan, labor promotion plans will focus on 16 occupations,
including journalists and engineers, while those for Israel would
focus on skilled construction workers, the minister said.

MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Manila will not allow investigator
Reiner Jacobi to go treasure hunting for the alleged ill-gotten
wealth of late president Ferdinand Marcos at the government's
expense, a senior government official said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora made this clear as he said
"Jacobi did this before, and the government would be stupid to
fall for it again."

<P>
Jacobi, an Australian investigator hired by the government to
help recover the alleged ill-gotten Marcos wealth, earlier claimed
to have information on a 13.2-billion-U.S. dollar account of Irene
Marcos Araneta, Marcos' youngest daughter.
</P>
<P>
He accused the Presidential Commission on Good Government of
blocking efforts to recover the money allegedly stashed in a Swiss
bank.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said that Jacobi is now trying to make a big issue out
of the Marcos wealth by "peddling" the story of the account.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Two Palestinians were shot dead
 and three others injured in Gaza Strip Wednesday during clashes
with Palestinian police and security forces, the Voice of
Palestine said.
</P>
<P>
The clashes erupted in Rafah, south of Gaza Strip, after a
military court Wednesday convicted three members of Palestinian
Preventive Forces (former members of the Islamic militant group
Hamas) of killing Capt. Rafat Joudeh in early February.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five-year-old Raed Attar was sentenced to death, while
his two accomplices were given 15 years in prison each.
</P>
<P>
The three killed Joudeh during a shootout for unknown reasons.
</P>
<P>
Following the court decision, hundreds of Palestinians started
to stone members of police and security forces who responded by
opening fire, killing Ala Jumah Humsi and Khamis Salameh, both 17.
</P>
<P>
Among the injured was a 10-year-old Palestinian child.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said that many Palestinian demonstrators also carry
weapons during the clashes and some of them opened fire at police,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat cut short his trip to Jordan
and returned to Gaza after the incident. Security forces have
imposed a curfew on the area.

<HEADLINE> Study Finds No Link Between Breast Cancer, Fat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A new study, published
Wednesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association,
finds no evidence that a high-fat diet promotes breast cancer or
that a low-fat diet protects against it.
</P>
<P>
However, researchers note that a low-fat diet is still good for
the heart and other aspects of health.
</P>
<P>
The finding contradicts current medical theories. Doctors have
theorized that eating lots of fat increases breast-cancer risk.
This view is based on animal studies, international comparisons
and studies of women who developed breast cancer and women who
didn't.
</P>
<P>
The 14-year new study tracked 88,795 women in the continuing
Nurses' Health Study. The women, ages 30 to 55, completed detailed
questionnaires about their eating habits every four years from
1980 to 1994. Researchers compared the diets of the women without
breast cancer and the 2,956 women whose breast cancer was
discovered during the course of the study.
</P>
<P>
Breast cancer was found to be no more common among women who
ate lots of fat, or among those who ate a large proportion of
animal fat, polyunsaturated fat (vegetable fat) or
trans-unsaturated fat. Nor was breast cancer any less common in
women who got a high proportion of their fats from fish oil or who
got less than 20 percent of their total calories from fat.
</P>
<P>
The study notes that the key is the type of fat consumed,
rather than the amount; that fish oil offers some protection from
breast cancer; or that contaminants stored in fat trigger breast
cancer.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that further study is needed to look more
carefully at how diet may affect the risk of breast cancer.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Orders Japanese Encephalitis Vaccination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian government
Wednesday directed that immediate vaccination be conducted on
residents and hogs in areas confirmed to be infected by the
Japanese Encephalitis (JE) disease.
</P>
<P>
A sum of 35.5 million ringgit (9.342 million U.S. dollars) has
been allocated for the vaccination, one of five immediate measures
taken by the government to prevent an outbreak of the disease, the
Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
The vaccination will be conducted by the Veterinary Services
Department which will provide the vaccine and logistics, Bernama
quoted Chief Secretary to the Government Abdul Halim Ali as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Some 30,000 pig farmers, their workers and family members in
the affected areas, and 262,500 other residents aged between one
year and 15 years who are staying within a two-kilometer radius of
the affected areas will go for the exercise, he said.
</P>
<P>
Local authorities have been instructed to fog the affected
areas once a week for at least the next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
The cabinet has also banned the movement of pigs except to
abattoirs.
</P>
<P>
The Information Ministry has been required to disseminate
information on ways to control and prevent the spread of the
disease.
</P>
<P>
Radio and television will also be used to inform the public
that the disease is spread by mosquitoes and not by eating pork.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that 45 people have allegedly died of the JE
disease, which first spread in Ipoh, the northern state of Perak
and currently in the southern state of Negeri Sembilan.
</P>
<P>
So far some 3,000 pigs have reportedly been destroyed and
almost 4,000 abandoned in affected farms.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Palace Museum, the
imperial palace for two Chinese dynasties in power for over 500
years, has announced plans to build a two-level underground
exhibition center.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Curator Pei Huanlu said the 19,000-sq.m. center will
exhibit a large number of precious cultural relics.
</P>
<P>
According to him, lower level will feature exhibits of gold
ornaments, jewelry, diamonds and jade, with the upper floor
dedicated to paintings, calligraphy and bronze ware
</P>
<P>
The Palace Museum, also known as Forbidden City, was
constructed in 1420 and is the largest and best preserved ancient
complex in China. The museum, which houses well over 930,000
cultural relics in nine categories, exhibits some 8,000 relics
annually.
</P>
<P>
"A mere one percent of the relics inventory is currently
exhibited," said Pei, adding that "the new exhibition center will
improve the protection of relics and enable the museum to maximize
the use of underground space."
</P>
<P>
He said the center, which will feature the same architectural
style as the existing structure, will be equipped with fire
prevention, air conditioning and various other systems designed to
protect cultural relics.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Shelves Hike in Telephone Tariffs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government on
Wednesday shelves the increases of telephone rentals and local
call charges announced Tuesday by the Telecom Regulatory Authority
of India (TRAI).
</P>
<P>
"Government has decided to issue a policy direction to TRAI to
keep its order of March 9, 1999, in abeyance till the entire issue
is considered by the government," Communications Minister Jagmohan
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed stiff opposition by several parties
including a major ally of the coalition led by the Bharatiya
Janata Party (BJP), Trinamool Congress, whose members staged a
walkout and decided to boycott the on-going parliament proceedings
till the hike was withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
TRAI announced here Tuesday that basic telephone rentals in
urban areas would go up by 30 percent, or from 190 rupees (4.49
U.S. dollars) to 250 rupees (5.91 dollars) per month.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, cellular monthly rentals would be increased
from the current 156 rupees (3.69 dollars) to 600 rupees (14.18
dollars), a hike of 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
TRAI also announced that domestic long distance charges would
be reduced by 45 percent while international call charges will be
cut by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The hike in basic telephone rentals and reduction in domestic
long distance and international call charges was planned to
implemented over a three-year period beginning April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
TRAI said that the adjustment is aimed at rationalizing the
tariff regime by streamlining the different user groups by taking
into account usage pattern, size of the exchange and the
teledensity.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Defense Secretary Visits Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen arrived here Wednesday as part of his nine-nation Middle
East tour to rally support for the U.S.-British air strikes on
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Cohen is expected to meet Jordanian King Abdullah Bin Hussein
to explain the U.S. policy on Iraq, and diplomatic sources here
said he was also trying to drum up support for a plan to topple
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah and Cohen are also expected to review bilateral
military cooperation and the U.S. military aid to the desert
kingdom, which U.S. President Bill Clinton regarded as a staunch
ally in the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
However, since acceding to the Jordanian throne on February 7,
Abdullah has on several occasions said that he would not allow any
force to use Jordan as a "spring board" for interference in the
internal affairs of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
The Jordanian government reiterated that it would follow a
policy of peace and develop friendly relations with all
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials also expressed support for the territorial
integrity of Iraq, calling for an end to the sufferings of the
Iraqi people, under crippling U.N. economic sanctions since Iraq's
invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Amman was sympathetic with Baghdad during the Gulf Crisis, for
which it paid a heavy price politically. To break its isolation,
it switched to a pro-Western policy thereafter, but still depends
on Iraq for cheap oil to fuel the resource-barren country.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is the seventh leg of Cohen's Middle East tour, which
had also taken him to Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates, Bahrain and Saudi Arabia.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Calls For Global Package for Asia Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a key-note speech at the seventh session of the Committee
for Regional Economic Cooperation, Supachai said that such a
package could be complemented by promotion of intra-regional
trade.
</P>
<P>
"Groupings like the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) have been successful in expanding regional trade but even
this is not enough because all of Asia has plunged into crisis,"
he said at the session held by the United Nations Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) from Wednesday
to Friday.
</P>
<P>
Despite the crisis and pressure from domestic lobbies, Supachai
urged all nations to keep expanding trade by keeping their markets
open because, he said, the process of globalization could not be
reversed.
</P>
<P>
He also recommended that nations facilitate the flow of
good-quality foreign direct investment funds by practicing
good-quality macroeconomic policies.
</P>
<P>
Adrianus Mooy, executive secretary of ESCAP, said that the
pursuit of outward-oriented policies will continue to be critical
in the coming years, but only innovation can create an expanding
"pie" which would allow both developing and developed countries to
capture economic and social opportunities.
</P>
<P>
On trade front, Mooy endorsed the European Union's call for a
concerted effort to complete membership negotiations with more
than 30 developing countries seeking to join the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
"In Asia, the proposed initiative should cover China and the
Russian Federation, as well as countries such as Cambodia, the Lao
People's Democratic Republic, Nepal and Vietnam," he said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from over 25 member countries of the ESCAP
region and representatives from U.N. bodies and specialized
agencies are attending the three-day meeting.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is being held to discuss ways of harnessing the
vast potential that exists for economic growth and capitalizing on
the new opportunities to enhance intra-regional trade, investment
and technology flows.

<HEADLINE> Chen Hong Fails to Advance in All England Open Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chen Hong of China failed to
advance at the centennial All England Open Badminton Championships
after he lost to Malaysian veteran Rashid Sidek in the men's
singles event here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese player, after winning the first set 15-0, did not
control his pace in the following two sets, losing the match at 17-
14 and 15-7.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Chen Hong was also ousted by the Malaysian
rival at the quater-finals of the Taipei Open earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
After taking the first set, Chen Hong managed to hold Sidek to
12-all and 13-all in the second set. With a 14-13 and service
advantage, the obviously nervous Chen Hong did not show a strong
hand at the moment, which gave Sidek a chance to take back the
service and level the score before winning the second set.
</P>
<P>
The third set had been a lop-sided one, which witnessed a 15-7
win for Sidek, who is 12 years older than Chen.
</P>
<P>
"I simply could not concentrate in the last set," Chen Hong
said after the match.
</P>
<P>
Chinese team head coach Li Yongbo pointed out that Chen's
failure was due to his ability to control the court. "Sidek is a
very experienced player, but his strength and stamina is not a
match to Chen, who should have played a fater game in the match."

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Shines With Help of Gold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Stronger commodity prices and
gold helped the Australian dollar to shine Wednesday, at one stage
helping it up by half a U.S. cent.
</P>
<P>
The local currency finished stronger at 63.50 U.S. cents from
63.16 previously after trading to a high of 63.70 during the
session.
</P>
<P>
Deutsche Bank currency strategist Tim Moloney said the
Australian dollar gained most of its ground on offshore markets
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"It had been struggling for a few days to get above 63.20 U.S.
cents and last night did," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It was helped by a combination of factors, the Commodity
Research Bureau (CRB) Index was up again and gold - gold couldn't
carry on with it but it has been looking a bit healthier in recent
days."
</P>
<P>
The CRB index closed at 188.15 points, up 0.51 and off a high
of 188.97.
</P>
<P>
Gold for current delivery closed at 292.40 U.S. dollars per
ounce, up 70 U.S. cents from Tuesday's close.
</P>
<P>
Moloney also said the U.S. dollar had been weakening over the
past few days in line with receding rate hike expectations.
</P>
<P>
"The receding tightening expectations in the United States are
a key factor here because they have been one thing putting the
commodity currencies like the Aussie (Australian dollar), Canadian
dollar and the New Zealand dollar under a fair bit of pressure in
recent weeks," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar was also buying 76.85 Japanese yen from
76.21 and 0.5831 euro from 0.5784.

<HEADLINE> 260-Million-Year-Old Animal Fossil Found in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A 260-million-year-old
fossil animal species has been discovered in western South Africa,
a research team said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fossil, a skull of a sheep-sized animal, was found near
Williston, Northern Cape, South African Press Association
reported.
</P>
<P>
The discoverers, a group of paleontologists from the
Witwatersrand University, said the finding reinforced the idea
that the distant ancestors of mammal actually came from South
Africa.
</P>
<P>
The fossil animal was believed to be the most primitive member
yet found of a group of plant-eaters, known as anomodonts, which
dominated the land during the Permian Period more than 250 million
years ago - prior to the dinosaur era.
</P>
<P>
Before the discovery, it was thought that anomodonts and some
other primitive creatures originated in Russia.
</P>
<P>
The new find enabled researchers to re-evaluate the family
relationships of the anomodonts, and to show that South Africa was
actually an evolutionary hot spot 260 million years ago, the team
said.

<HEADLINE> China Studying Specific Questions on Rights Covenant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Standing Committee of China's
National People's Congress (NPC) needs to study some specific
questions relating to the International Covenant on Economic,
Social and Cultural Rights before its ratification by China, and
this reflects a responsible attitude and is also a normal
international practice.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, a deputy director of the Legislative Affairs
Commission under the NPC Standing Committee, made the remarks
while answering a question about why China has not ratified the
international covenant one year after the Chinese government
signed it.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government signed the United Nations' International
Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in October, 1997
and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, in
October, 1998, according to Qiao.
</P>
<P>
The first covenant has been submitted to the NPC Standing
Committee for examination and ratification last year, while the
second one is still with the State Council and has not been
submitted to the NPC Standing Committee for examination and
ratification, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
China's lawful seat in the United Nations was not resumed at
the time when the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights was adopted by the General Assembly of the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
Because China did not participate in the deliberating and
drafting of the covenant, the NPC Standing Committee feels there
are many specific questions that need to be studied, Qiao noted.
</P>
<P>
Taking the United States as an example, Qiao said that it took
15 years for the U.S. Congress to ratify the International
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights after the U.S. government
signed it in 1977, and that the U.S. Congress still has not
ratified the International Covenant on Economic, Social and
Cultural Rights 22 years after the U.S. government signed it.
</P>
<P>
Less than one year has passed since the State Council submitted
the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights
to the NPC Standing Committee for examination and study. "It is
not really such a long time," he noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Visit Tibet Culture Show </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, visited an exhibition on Tibetan culture
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The show, entitled "Snowland Pearl -- Culture Exhibition of
China's Tibet," was inaugurated at the Beijing Exhibition Center
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is the largest of its kind in China. On display
are exhibits showing development and achievements in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, more than 190 historical relics, archives and
documents, art works of various kinds, costumes and decorations of
Tibetans, and the life-style and work-style of Tibetan people
working for a better life today.
</P>
<P>
According to an exhibition sponsor, all the historical relics
and archives on show are hard evidence for the historical fact
that Tibet has been an alienable part of China and the more than
190 historical relics on display show the historical changes and
the intimate relations between Tibet and the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 official documents and letters, many of them are
original copies, illustrate the relations between the Tibet local
government and the central government since the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
The objects and pictures also show how the Tibetan people were
cruelly oppressed and exploited under the feudal slave system and
the rapid economic and social development and the big improvement
of their life in the past four decades after the democratic reform
following the abolishing of the feudal slave system.
</P>
<P>
"This exhibition really can enable its visitors to have a
better understanding of Tibet's history and culture," a female
legislator from east China's Shanghai commented.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is jointly sponsored by the State Council Press
Office and the regional government of Tibet, with assistance from
several other government and non-government bodies.

<P>
DHAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bangladeshi Finance Minister A.M.S.
Kabria Wednesday urged Indian entrepreneurs to take part in joint
venture projects in his country with buy-back arrangement for
mutual interests, an official handout said.
</P>
<P>
Trade-generating joint-venture investments in Bangladesh would
help reduce the existing huge trade gap between the two
neighboring countries, Kabria said during a meeting with Indian
Commerce Minister Ramakrishna Hegde, who arrived here Tuesday on a
three-day visit to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladesh's imports from India stood at 755 million U.S.
dollars during the 1997-98 fiscal year, while its exports to the
latter were only 50 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also discussed other ways and means to remove
the widening trade imbalance between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Bangladesh' various facilities offered to foreign
investors in the country, Kabria said there is immense room for
increasing trade cooperation with the eastern part of India if
joint ventures are set up in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The Indian commerce minister assured Kabria that he would look
into the proposals of joint venture initiatives and expressed his
keen interest in major investment in Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Legislators Visit Tibet Culture Show (Recast) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers attending the
ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress,
China's top legislature, visited an exhibition on Tibetan culture
here this evening.
</P>
<P>
The show, entitled "Snowland Pearl -- Culture Exhibition of
China's Tibet," was inaugurated at the Beijing Exhibition Center
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is the largest of its kind in China. On display
are exhibits showing development and achievements in the Tibet
Autonomous Region, more than 190 historical relics, archives and
documents, art works of various kinds, costumes and decorations of
Tibetans, and the life-style and work-style of Tibetan people
working for a better life today.
</P>
<P>
According to an exhibition sponsor, all the historical relics
and archives on show are hard evidence for the historical fact
that Tibet has been an inalienable part of China and the more than
190 historical relics on display show the historical changes and
the intimate relations between Tibet and the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 official documents and letters, many of them are
original copies, illustrate the relations between the Tibet local
government and the central government since the 13th century.
</P>
<P>
The objects and pictures also show how the Tibetan people were
cruelly oppressed and exploited under the feudal slave system and
the rapid economic and social development and the big improvement
of their life in the past four decades after the democratic reform
following the abolishing of the feudal slave system.
</P>
<P>
"This exhibition really can enable its visitors to have a
better understanding of Tibet's history and culture," a female
legislator from east China's Shanghai commented.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is jointly sponsored by the State Council Press
Office and the regional government of Tibet, with assistance from
several other government and non-government bodies.

<TEXT>
<P>
Accompanied by first lady Graca Machel and Foreign Minister
Alfred Nzo, Mandela will tour the Netherlands, Finland, Denmark,
Norway and Sweden, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
These countries are among the strongest European supporters of
the anti- Apartheid movement in South Africa, and they have been
engaged in development cooperation with the democratic South
African government since 1994.
</P>
<P>
The visit is mainly ceremonial, with Mandela bidding farewell
to the leaders of the countries ahead of the June election, and
expressing South Africa's gratitude for these countries' help.
</P>
<P>
The issue of a key trade agreement between the European Union
(EU) and South Africa is expected to be raised during the trip.
</P>
<P>
The draft deal, hammered out in January after four years of
negotiations, is yet to be approved by the EU Council of
Ministers.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's first stop will be Amsterdam, the Netherlands, where
he is expected to receive honors from the city and a local
university.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Legislature Beefs up Legislation, Supervision: Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A legislative official said here
today that China's National People's Congress has been making
steady progress in legislation and exercising supervision over law
enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Xiaoyang, a deputy director of the Legislation Affairs
Commission under the NPC Standing Committee, made the comment here
today at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the functions of the NPC, Qiao
said that, as the nation's supreme organ of power, the NPC has the
right to enact laws, exercise supervision over law enforcement,
appoint or remove state leaders, and decide on major issues.
</P>
<P>
In implementing the principle of the rule of law, he said,
there must be enough laws to go by. And that is why the NPC and
its Standing Committee need to strengthen legislation and step up
supervision over law enforcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past twenty years of reform and opening up, the NPC has
been making progress in doing legislative and supervisory work
year by year," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Zhang Chunsheng, another deputy director of the
Legislative Affairs Commission, to ensure the authority of the
Constitution and laws, the NPC Standing Committee introduced last
year a put-on-the-record system for the review of local laws,
regulations and ordinances.
</P>
<P>
"Local laws, regulations and ordinances found to have
contravened national laws have been revoked by relevant local
authorities at the notice of the NPC Standing Committee," he said.
</P>
<P>
The NPC Standing Committee is also mulling a law of supervision,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Currency Accounts Won't be Defrozen: Pak FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Although stressing its
achievement in stabilizing foreign currency market, the Pakistani
government Wednesday announced it has no intention to defreeze
foreign currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
There is no possibility that foreign currency accounts will be
defrozen, Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar said clearly at a
news conference here.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan congealed foreign currency accounts after last May's
nuclear tests in a bid to prevent substantial outflow of foreign
currency and support the status of Pakistani rupee in the market.
</P>
<P>
The finance minister, meanwhile, emphasized that the government
had made great achievements in reviving economy and maintain
stability of rupee.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange reserves stood at 1.66 billion U.S.
dollars on March 9, more than trifold of an all-time low of less
than 500 million dollars last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Significant increases in imports and exports were recorded in
February, he added, which is a good signal suggesting that
economic activity is picking up.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's exports in February amounted to 603 million dollars,
10.2 percent higher than in January, and imports rose 11 percent
to 770 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Dar also noted that the gap between free market and composite
rate is narrowing. The rate of the rupee against the U.S. dollar
was 49.20 in the interbank market and the composite rate was 48.62
on Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Eases Foreign Exchange Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- With economic activity picking
up and further improvement in the country's exchange rate regime,
the Pakistani government decided Wednesday to allow exporters to
sell more of their export proceeds in the interbank market.
</P>
<P>
From Thursday, exporters will be able to sell 95 percent of
their export proceeds in the market while only 5 percent is
required to be surrendered to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP).
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Pakistani Finance Minister Ishaq Dar at a
news conference here with a view to further facilitating business
activities in the country.
</P>
<P>
Until Wednesday exporters are required to sell 20 percent of
their export proceeds to the SBP while the proportion allowed to
be sold in the market is 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Similarly, importers can now purchase 95 percent of their
foreign exchange under the new arrangement.
</P>
<P>
"It was only possible because of surging stability in the local
unit, leading to a downward slide in the composite rate and
narrowing of the gap between the official and the open market
rate," Dar said.
</P>
<P>
The interbank floating rate of the Pakistani rupee against the
U.S. dollar was 49.20:1 while the composite rate was 48.67:1 on
Wednesday, which was all time low.
</P>
<P>
Dar described the stability in the exchange rate as vital for a
viable balance of payments, adding that "we have succeeded in
maintaining a stable exchange rate regime through our judicious
policy."
</P>
<P>
The minister revealed that the foreign exchange reserves of
Pakistan stood at 1.66 billion dollars as of March 9.

<HEADLINE> No Dramatic Changes Expected in Cape Verde's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the ruling Democratic
Movement party (MPD) of Cape Verde, Carlos Veiga, has said in
capital Praia that his party does not favor a dramatic change in
the country's constitution.
</P>
<P>
Veiga, who is also acting prime minister of the country, made
the remarks Tuesday at a press conference. He said that the the
on-going discussion on amendment will only mean perfection and
supplement to the constitution.
</P>
<P>
The MPD chairman said that the constitutional amendment will
focus on strengthening the basic and human rights of the people,
the perfecting of mild parliamentary system and that of cabinet
responsibility, and also outlining the organization modality of
market economy.
</P>
<P>
Veiga said that the new constitution will give the national
language Crioulo the same status as the official Portuguese
language, create a special legislative institution for human right
protection, raise the social status of women and guarantee
children's rights and fair competition in political and social
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The new law will strengthen the transparency in management and
grant central bank with more autonomy, delete such content as the
limit on the cooperation between foreign investors and national
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The president will also be granted the right to disband
parliament after he gets permission from the Council of the
Republic, thus enhancing the right of the president.
</P>
<P>
The new constitution will also give parliament more
flexibility, enabling it to maintain a mild parliament system.
</P>
<P>
The ruling MDP is taking 50 of the 72 seats in parliament, so
the constitutional amendment proposals raised by the MDP will
likely to be passed at the parliament debate scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
The current constitution, which was passed in 1992, stipulates
that Cape Verde is a democratic legislative sovereign country,
with a mild parliament system.

<HEADLINE> Zhu Rongji on Straightening Out China's Economic Order </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji said
here today that China would further intensify its efforts of law
enforcement this year so as to straighten out and standardize the
country's economic order.
</P>
<P>
"We must deal a quick and heavy blow on various economic crimes
according to law with no lenience, and take a resolute stand in
punishing the criminals severely," Zhu, also a Standing Committee
member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
Central Committee, told deputies to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top legislature in session here since last
Friday, from Guangdong and Sichuan Provinces during panel
discussions this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
A severe crackdown on economic crimes is an important component
of the strategy of governing the country according to law, as well
as a major guarantee for the smooth development of the reform,
opening-up and modernization drive and for maintaining social
stability, said the premier.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, governments at all levels did a lot of work
in straightening out and standardizing the financial order,
cracking down on smuggling and foreign exchange infractions and
levying taxes according to law, and achieved marked successes.
</P>
<P>
"However, economic order remains in serious chaos in quite a
few places at present," Zhu said, adding that effective measures
must be taken to safeguard the authority and dignity of national
laws and the order of the socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He also called on people in both provinces to make unswerving
efforts to further promote reform and opening-up and achieve
greater successes.
</P>
<P>
Some Guangdong and Sichuan deputies also voiced their opinions
on issues ranging from the crackdown on smuggling to the reform of
state-owned enterprises during the panel discussions.

<HEADLINE> Japan Says Asian Monetary Fund Scheme Not Called Off </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Japan has never called off
the Asian Monetary Fund (AMF) scheme, which was proposed when the
regional crisis erupted and opposed by the United States, a
Japanese official said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Throughout 1998, Japan did not disavow the scheme nor accepted
the Manila Framework as the last word as it was considered a step
towards the AMF's establishment, Hajime Shinohara, managing
director of Japan's Institute for International Monetary Affairs,
told the 21st joint conference of Malaysia-Japan Economic
Associations here.
</P>
<P>
"It seems that after the Russian crisis in the summer of 1998,
the United States withdrew its antagonism towards this scheme and
we are now at a stage where we should give earnest study to it,"
the Malaysian national news agency Bernama quoted the official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Shinohara said the AMF should be an independent
institutionalized body with its members comprising Asian countries
that have relatively well developed monetary markets such as the
ASEAN nations, the newly industrialized Asian economies, Oceanic
countries, China and Japan.
</P>
<P>
He said one of the AMF's functions is crisis management which
must be backed by the capability to mobilize funds.
</P>
<P>
Another function of the AMF is to become the core of various
structures that are aimed at preventing the resurgence of a
monetary crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said a mechanism must be devised to raise funds in the
market, backed by the foreign reserves of member countries as
collateral, or by guarantee contracts or some form of callable
subscriptions to its capital by members.
</P>
<P>
Shinohara suggested the formation of a forum for the monetary
authorities of members to co-ordinate their policies, the
establishment of a settlement system for the countries' currencies
and the setting up of an economic research institute.
</P>
<P>
He said part of the "basic thinking" behind the AMF is to
achieve effective mutual utilization of savings in the region.
</P>
<P>
The AMF had been expected to kick off with 100 billion U.S.
dollars but was watered down with the formation of the regional
surveillance group, the Manila Framework.
</P>
<P>
The Manila Framework is primarily a regional surveillance group
formed in Manila in November 1997 in response to the East Asian
financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Stresses Rule of Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing stressed
here today the importance of running the country according to law.
</P>
<P>
"We should mainly do two things in this regard," he said. "One
is to speed up the establishment of a well-functioning legal
system; and the other is to pay attention to the training and
fostering of a large contingent of highly qualified legislative
and law-enforcement personnel."
</P>
<P>
The vice premier, who is also a member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee, expressed the view at a group discussion
attended by Hubei deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress,
in session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Li said amendments to the Constitution being deliberated by
the NPC, when adopted, will have a far-reaching positive influence
on political, economic and social development in China.
</P>
<P>
Problems that may arise in the process of establishing a
socialist market economy and contradictions in social life need to
be resolved through legislation and law enforcement, he said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the view that China has made great progress in
improving the moral standard and competence of law-enforcement
personnel and strengthening supervision over law-enforcement.
</P>
<P>
Some pending problems, such as the levying of illegal charges,
have resulted from the lack of a legal awareness on the part of
violators and have to be resolved through legal means including
the substitution of charges by a tax, he said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian President Asks All Parties to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President B.J. Habibie
Wednesday asked all political parties to support the June 7
general election.
</P>
<P>
The president likened it to a sports event where the winners
and the losers have to accept the result nobly.
</P>
<P>
"I ask the country's youth to help prepare the general election
to make it fair and just so that it would address the people's
aspirations and uphold the people's sovereignty," he told
participants of a national coordinating meeting of youth and
sports at the state palace here.
</P>
<P>
The June general election will elect a new House of
Representatives, whose members will be part of the 700-strong
People's Consultative Assembly, the nation's highest legislative
body, which will select the next president.
</P>
<P>
A total of 48 political parties will contest the election. The
multi-party elections are one of the political reforms launched by
Habibie's Administration.
</P>
<P>
The head of state said there is a tendency for state idealism
to lose ground, whereas it is necessary for immediate change and
dynamic living.
</P>
<P>
"Many kinds of violence (break out) from inter-group rifts...
as a result of a decline in (state) idealism", he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said the Indonesian society's complexity should
not become an obstacle to unity and integrity. Strong unity and
integrity among all components of the nation, no matter which
ethnic or religious group they come from, is the main basis for
the country to get out of its economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Unity and integrity are necessary to complete reforms and
build the country's future," he added.

<HEADLINE> Manila Remains Firm on Abducted Officers' Release </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government
Wednesday reiterated that it will not negotiate with the New
People's Army (NPA) until the rebels release unharmed the four
officers they abducted and held in hostage.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in an interview that
the rebels should immediately release the abducted officers
without any conditions, instead of warning that time is running
out for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
"They should correct what they did. This means they have to
free the hostages," he said.
</P>
<P>
Philippine President Joseph Estrada earlier indefinitely
suspended formal peace talks with the NPA following the abduction
by NPA guerrillas last month of army general Victor Obillo, his
aide and police inspector Roberto Bernal.
</P>
<P>
Army sergeant Alipio Lozada was kidnapped last weekend by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
The NPA recently invited the government to negotiate for the
release of the hostages, but the proposal was flatly rejected.
</P>
<P>
"Of course, we are concerned about the security of our
personnel, but this should not be used as the reason for returning
to the negotiating table," Zamora said.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Seeking to Remove Threat of War on Peninsula </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 10 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Dae-jung
on Wednesday urged countries, including the United States, to
establish diplomatic ties with Pyongyang and to lift economic and
trade sanctions against the country.
</P>
<P>
In return, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK)
will give up its program of developing weapons of mass destruction,
Kim said at the 47th commencement of the Korea Air Force Academy.
</P>
<P>
If such proposals are accepted by both sides, the threat of war
on the Korean Peninsula could be removed soon, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The president's speech drew much public attention as it came
one day after his talk with visiting U.S. coordinator on the DPRK
policy, William Perry, in Seoul. Perry, former U.S. defense
secretary, agreed to continue support of President Kim's "sunshine
policy" toward the DPRK, which seeks reconciliation, exchange and
cooperation based on separating the economics from politics.
</P>
<P>
"Consequently, I will continue to push the engagement policy
steadily as I am firmly convinced that we will soon be able to
remove the threat of war from the Korean Peninsula." Kim said.
</P>
<P>
The president also said South Korea at the same time should be
ready to embrace any sign of reform and openness in the DPRK.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said, "Military diplomacy and cooperation with
neighboring countries will be actively pursued to settle peace on
the peninsula".
</P>
<P>
Perry will submit his report on to DPRK policy to President
Clinton and the U.S. Congress late this month.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Offers Iran Cooperation on Afghan Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is determined to
cooperate closely with Iran in a bid to restore peace to
Afghanistan, said visiting top Pakistani legislator Illahi Bakhsh
Soomro on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Iranian parliament before winding up his
four-day visit, Soomro, Speaker of the Pakistani National
Assembly, expressed regret that some Afghan groups have turned
their guns against each other instead of engaging in
reconstruction of their war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
He urged Islamabad and Tehran to work together to put an end to
the sufferings of the Afghan people, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Soomro also expressed hope that Afghan factions would stop
their fightings and form a broad-based multi-ethnic government.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan insists on establishing durable peace and
stability in south Asia.
</P>
<P>
Islamabad believes that the peaceful settlement of outstanding
disputes, confidence building and a strategic restraint regime in
nuclear and conventional fields are indispensable conditions for
defusing tensions, safeguarding peace and stability and creating a
climate conducive to regional cooperation, progress and prosperity
in south Asia, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's nuclear tests, he said, the sole purpose of the
tests was to avert the serious threats posed to Pakistan's
security by restoring the strategic balance in the region.
</P>
<P>
Before his departure, he also expressed regret over the
assassinations of Iranian nationals in his country and said that
great efforts have been made to identify and arrest those
responsible for the killings.
</P>
<P>
He said that some suspects have been arrested for alleged
involvement in serial murders of Iranian nationals in Pakistan
during the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Although Pakistani judicial system does not permit execution of
murderers, the most possible severe punishment will be carried out
in this regard, Soomro said.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing Hopes to Join Hands With Shanghai, HK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Municipality of Chongqing in
southwest China is eager to join hands with Shanghai and Hong Kong
to promote economic development in the entire Yangtze River basin,
a senior local official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Our cooperation can be based on Hong Kong's attraction of
international capital, Shanghai's technology and management skills,
and Chongqing's industrial foundation and access to the entire
southwestern market," said Li Deshui, vice mayor of Chongqing who
is here attending the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, China's top legislature, as a deputy.
</P>
<P>
While Shanghai and Hong Kong are world famous metropolises and
China's major economic and financial powerhouses, Chongqing has
only started to gain some fame since it was upgraded to be the
country's fourth municipality directly under the jurisdiction of
the central government two years ago.
</P>
<P>
However, Li stressed that Chongqing has always been a city of
great importance in the southwest and along the upper reaches of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
As one of the few old industrial bases in the region, Chongqing
has become all the more important at a time when the central
government has decided to build the Three Gorges Dam, the world's
largest hydropower and water conservation project on the Yangtze
River, and to help the underdeveloped central and western part of
the country to catch up with the much more prosperous eastern
coastal regions, said the vice mayor.
</P>
<P>
Geographically speaking, he said, Chongqing, Shanghai and Hong
Kong are respectively at the three tips of a triangle, and this
large triangular area boasts rich reserves of natural and human
resources, sufficient capital and skilled personnel, as well as a
solid industrial base and a huge market.
</P>
<P>
"If all cities and regions in this part of China combine their
efforts to seek economic growth, they will be able to cast a
significant and far-reaching impact on the overall development of
the whole country in the 21st century," said Li.
</P>
<P>
Economists note that some 40 percent of China's 1.2 billion
population live in the Yangtze River basin, which, with only 15
percent of the country's total territorial space, contributes more
than 40 percent of the national economic quantity.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that the Yangtze River basin will turn out to be
the most promising economic belt in China in the next century," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Li went on to say that various signs show that Shanghai and
Hong Kong are also considering to increase their cooperation and
exchanges with Chongqing, so as to increase their influence on the
economy of the Yangtze River basin.
</P>
<P>
"Some experts and entrepreneurs from Shanghai and Hong Kong
already paid several visits to our city, and we discussed a number
of projects on which the three sides can develop comprehensive
cooperation," he revealed.

of the Taiwan problem.

<TEXT>
<P>
XINING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Strong winds over the past few
weeks have resulted in heavy property losses in some parts of
northwest China's Qinghai Province.
</P>
<P>
The local meteorological department reported that various parts
of the province have experienced force 7 winds and above over the
past month.
</P>
<P>
Experts point out that persistent strong winds rarely occur in
pastureland areas at 4,000 meters above sea level.
</P>
<P>
The continuing strong winds have destroyed a number of
ramshackle houses in the area. The head of Madoi County disclosed
that windstorms over the past two days have resulted in direct
property losses of well over 450,000 yuan, killed over 18,000
sheep and damaged some 130-odd houses.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that southern and western Qinghai Province, as
well as areas around the Qinghai Lake, will continue to experience
strong winds over the next few days.

<HEADLINE> Cathay Pacific Reports First Full Year Loss in 35 Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Cathay Pacific
Airways today announced a net loss of 542 million HK dollars (70
million U.S. dollars) during 1998, compared with a profit of 1.69
billion HK dollars (217 million U.S. dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the 1998 annual results, Cathay Pacific Chairman
Peter Sutch said the company's turnover fell 12.9 percent to 26.7
billion HK dollars (3.42 billion U.S. dollars). This is the first
time the company has made an annual loss since 1963.
</P>
<P>
Sutch said the disappointing results reflect the full impact of
the Asian economic downturn on the company's operation, the
widespread economic weakness and lower passenger loads and yields.
</P>
<P>
The amount of cargo transported fell, and the airline's related
businesses of catering, ramp-handling and aircraft maintenance
were also adversely affected, Sutch said.
</P>
<P>
"1998 will stand out as one of the most difficult years in the
history of Cathay Pacific, as the severe conditions of the Asian
economies took a heavy toll on many of our key markets," said
Sutch.
</P>
<P>
"Nevertheless, we have taken this opportunity to overhaul many
of our operations and we are confident that we will be stronger
than ever once the anticipated recovery occurs," he said.
</P>
<P>
It was a difficult year for the airline's passenger operations
as the regional downturn, which began in 1997, continued unabated,
Sutch said, adding that almost all routes served by the airline
suffered as a result, particularly those to Japan and Southeast
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Long-haul routes to America and Europe, although better, were
also affected. On a bright note, new services to Istanbul and San
Francisco launched in 1998 have performed credibly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sutch said the disruptions by the start-up difficulties at Hong
Kong's new airport in July cost the airline about 350 to 400
million Hong Kong dollars (45 to 51 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The group's cargo services reported turnover of 7.04 billion (
903 million U.S. dollars), a 9.5 percent decrease over 1997. Cargo
revenue accounted for 26.4 percent of the group's total turnover.
</P>
<P>
Passenger yields fell to 45.2 HK cents (5.8 U.S. cents) per
revenue passenger kilometer, from 55.7 HK cents (7.1 U.S. cents)
the previous year, down by 18.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
To cut its costs, Cathay has asked some of its pilots to take a
pay cut. Cathay has seen a reduction in staff numbers of about 2,
000 in 1998, of which about half were due to retrenchments, and
another half due to natural attrition, said David Turnbull, chief
executive officer at the airline.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific has taken a number of steps to improve its
competitiveness, which include the removal from service of some
old aircraft and putting into operation new planes as well as the
rigorous cost-saving program.
</P>
<P>
Cathay Pacific also positioned itself to meet widening global
competition by becoming a founder member of the new oneworld
alliance along with American Airlines, British Airways, Canadian
Airlines, and Qantas Airways.
</P>
<P>
The year ahead also appeared set to be tough, but with the
airline's investment in Hong Kong's new airport now in place,
Sutch said he looked to the future with confidence.
</P>
<P>
"We anticipate that we are probably bouncing somewhere along
the bottom," he said.

<HEADLINE> Hamas Activist Sentenced to Death for Killing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A Palestinian military court on
Wednesday sentenced a member of the Islamic militant group Hamas
to death for killing a Palestinian security agent in the Gaza
Strip one month ago, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The 25-year-old Raed Attar and two others were convicted of
shooting dead Capt. Rifat Joudeh, a member of the Preventive
Security Service in the Gaza Strip town of Rafah in early
February.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian National Authority said the three were Hamas
fugitives.
</P>
<P>
The two accomplices in the shootout were sentenced to 15 years
in prison each, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Wednesday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
met with Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Public Security
Minister Avigdor Kahalani to discuss the release of Palestinian
prisoners. No details about the meeting were available yet.
</P>
<P>
The move came as Netanyahu was trying to revive the stalled
peace process with the Palestinians by carrying out parts
of the Wye River agreement signed last October, including the
release of Palestinians in Israeli jails.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have rejected the "partial proposal," which
excluded the phased troop withdrawals from the West Bank, the
core of the latest interim accord.
</P>
<P>
Israel released 250 Palestinian prisoners in November, the
first of the three groups to be released under the Wye
agreement. But most of them were common criminals, not political
prisoners as demanded by the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Reaffirms "One China" Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Bulgarian Presidential Office
on Wednesday reaffirmed the country's "One China" policy regarding
its ties with China and denied any official contact with Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian President Petar Stoyanov chose the "One China" policy,
which was also advocated by the European Union and the United
States, during his visit to China in May 1998, said a spokesperson
from the presidential office in a telephone interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The "One China" policy will not change and the President's
Office has not had contact with Taiwan, he noted.
</P>
<P>
According to the 24 Hours newspaper, Taiwan sent Dr. Kvint,
manager of the U.S. Arter Anderson Financial Consultation
Corporation, to Bulgaria last year to seek to exchange economic
aid for Bulgaria's recognition of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Bulgarian president's economic consultant Angarski, who
reportedly met with Kvint in the report, told Xinhua Wednesday, "I'
ve never heard of, seen or met with Dr. Kvint."
</P>
<P>
Last May in his joint statement with Chinese President Jiang
Zemin, Stoyanov reaffirmed that "the Bulgarian Republic will not
establish official ties or contact with Taiwan."

<HEADLINE> U.S., Japan Agree on Comprehensive Approach Toward DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Japan
Wednesday agreed to pursue a "comprehensive approach" toward the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK).
</P>
<P>
Both William Perry, U.S. policy coordinator on the DPRK, and
Japanese officials declined to comment on details of the approach
which was agreed on during separate talks between Perry and
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, Chief Cabinet Secretary
Hiromu Nonaka, Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura, and Defense
Agency chief Hosei Norota.
</P>
<P>
During the meetings, Perry outlined his ongoing policy review
on the DPRK to Japanese leaders and gained support from the
Japanese side, Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Foreign Ministry officials said Obuchi and other
Japanese leaders supported "the ideas" explained by Perry as they
give "sufficient consideration" on concerns Japan conveyed to him
during his first visit last December to coordinate policy on the
DPRK.
</P>
<P>
In December, Perry agreed with the Japanese side that Japan,
South Korea and the United States should continue coordinating
steps under a policy combining engagement and deterrence to
prevent Pyongyang from developing nuclear weapons and missiles.
</P>
<P>
During the Wednesday talks, Perry and Japanese leaders
reaffirmed the importance of continuing close contacts to
coordinate steps among Tokyo, Seoul and Washington.
</P>
<P>
Japan maintains the DPRK on August 31 last year launched a
Taepodong ballistic missile, a part of which flew over Japan into
the Pacific Ocean. Pyongyang said it fired a rocket to send a
satellite into orbit.
</P>
<P>
Perry arrived here Tuesday for a two-day visit on the last leg
of his Northeast Asia tour which also includes China and South
Korea.

<HEADLINE> Legislator Explains Amendments to Constitution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China will not amend clauses in
the Constitution regarding protection for private properties
considering the principle for Constitutional amendments, Qiao
Xiaoyang, deputy director of the Legislative Affairs Commission
under the Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC) said at a press conference here today.
</P>
<P>
Constitution is a fundamental law of a nation, and any
amendments to Constitution should be strictly restricted, said
Qiao.
</P>
<P>
He said the principle for amending the Constitution is to
revise parts of it, amending only clauses which need to be amended
and clauses concerning issues with clear conclusions.
</P>
<P>
"No revision will be made to clauses in which revisions may be
or may not be made," he added.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Constitution adopted in 1982 is a good
Constitution, but amendments are necessary to increase its
authenticity with the deepening of the reform and opening-up and
the changing of the situation. " Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
"The amendments to be made this time is to write into the
Constitution the new experience which was summarized at the 15th
National Congress of the Communist Party of China," he said.
</P>
<P>
A wide-ranging opinions have been considered to make amendments
to the Constitution, excluding views that are already enshrined in
the Constitution and views that do not run counter to the
Constitutional stipulations, Qiao said.
</P>
<P>
Besides, China's Constitution already provides protection for
private properties as is stipulated in the 13th clause, which
offers protection for proprietary rights and inheritance rights
for lawful income, savings, real estate and other lawful
properties of all the citizens of the People's Republic of China.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the NPC deputies who are examining and deliberating
the draft amendments to the Constitution for the present, Qiao
pointed out that these legislators will make the final decision
concerning Constitutional amendments.

<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A grenade attack killed one
ruling People's Alliance (PA) supporter and wounded 24 others,
including a PA provincial candidate, after a rally in the Sri
Lanka's Western Province, the official radio reported Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
It is the first fatal incident since the North Western Province
Council poll early this year which was ridden with election
violence. Five more provincial council elections are due in April,
and election campaign is heating up across the country.
</P>
<P>
The grenade attack occurred Wednesday morning after the rally
at Kurunduwatte town near Gampaha, 34 kilometers northeast of the
capital, the radio said.
</P>
<P>
The PA Media Coordinating Unit said the dead was identified as
Wimlasuriya. Mahinda Aluthgama, the PA provincial council
candidate and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party organizer for
Nawalapitiya, was among the wounded.
</P>
<P>
The radio alleged that two grenades was apparently tossed at
the crowd by the opposition United National Party (UNP)
supporters.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that a convoy of 30 vehicles carrying UNP
provincial council candidate Rambukwella and Kandy Mayor Herendra
Dunuwila was driving by the rally at the time.
</P>

Police are conducting investigations.

<HEADLINE> French Bank Attempts Mega Take Over to Become No.1 in Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The mega-merger, if realized, would be the first in the history
of finance in its scale.
</P>
<P>
The new group to be created by the take over will be
temporarily called SBP and will be the world's number one in terms
of assets, which are expected to reach 850 billion euros (935
billion U.S. dollars) and 54 billion euros in market shares.
</P>
<P>
The BNP plans to acquire all the existing shares of Paribas and
Societe Generale through an exchange of shares.
</P>
<P>
The bank said in a statement that the take over will not result
in massive lay-offs of employees, or a reduction in the sales
network. A BNP spokesman said the new banking group will have 4,
700 agencies in France with about 130,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The Paribas and Societe Generale have reacted negatively to the
hostile bid, which they called "rash" and "unfriendly."
</P>
<P>
The merger is yet to be approved by the authorities in charge
of anti-trust and competition in the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The BNP estimated that the bidding would provide "the best
procedure for the French banking industry in response to similar
operations which have already been realized, or which will
eventually come to our neighbors in the euro zone."
</P>
<P>
The BNP's statement was apparently in reference to an expected
merger between the Deutsche Bank and U.S. Bankers Trust, which
would make the German bank the world's largest in terms of assets.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange of Paris said that the BNP was offering 15
new shares for seven shares of Societe Generale, and 11 for those
of Paribas.

<HEADLINE> Trimble "Disappointed" at Postponement of N.Irish Deadline </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland First Minister
David Trimble said on Wednesday he was "intensely disappointed"
that the original deadline to hand over home-rule powers had been
postponed due to a dispute on decommissioning.
</P>
<P>
Trimble has insisted that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) must
hand over its arms before its political wing Sinn Fein could join
the provincial assembly's cabinet, thus delaying the establishment
of the local government.
</P>
<P>
"I am intensely disappointed about the way this week has turned
out," Trimble, who leads the Ulster Unionist Party, told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
"As far as we are concerned...we have now carried everything as
far as we can. Now it is up to Sinn Fein and the other
paramilitaries to move," Trimble said.
</P>
<P>
The deadline to transfer home-rule powers to the province was
first set on Wednesday but postponed two days ago by the British
government for three weeks so that the parties could have more
time and space to sort out the dispute of disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said his own side had done all it could to enable the
March 10 deadline to be met and it was now up to the IRA and Sinn
Fein to move on the arms issue.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The number of illegal foreigners in
South Korea stood at 105,574 last month, up by a monthly average
of 2,000 since last September, said the Ministry of Justice on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials attribute the rise to the country's slow
economic recovery. Officials say those illegal residents will be
fined up to 10 million won (some 8,000 U.S. dollars) each when
caught and will be deported. Their employers will also be punished.
</P>
<P>
The number of illegal foreigners in South Korea dropped by 37
percent after the country suffered a financial crisis in late 1997,
which was caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The number dropped from 148,048 in December 1997 to 92,686 in
August 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, since last September, the number of illegal foreigners
has been increasing and hit 100,000 in January this year.

<HEADLINE> Excessive Rainfall Last Year Caused Severe Floods in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Excessive rainfall made 1998 a
year of severe floods and blizzards for many areas of China, while
drought-hit regions were quenched as a result, according to the
China Meteorological Administration.
</P>
<P>
Most parts of the country last year recorded greater
precipitation than normal, as amounts in parts of northeastern
China, the Huaihe River Basin, Inner Mongolia and Jiangxi Province
were 20 to 50 percent higher than normal, the administration said
in its newly released '98 China Climate Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Eastern and southeastern parts of China also experienced
unusual winter floods due to excessive rainfall, while blizzards
hit Qinghai Province and the Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Devastating floods caused great damage along the Yangtze,
Nenjiang and Songhua rivers last summer where precipitation was
close to or equaled the heaviest rains in 50 years.
</P>
<P>
However, plentiful rain in north China last spring brought a
great advantage to agricultural production since a persistent
drought was relieved, the bulletin said.

<HEADLINE> China's Maritime Industry Sees Rapid Growth in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's maritime industry
generated a total output value of 335 billion yuan (40 billion U.S.
dollars) last year, an increase of 11.6 percent in 1998, despite
of negative impact of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
According to industrial sources here today, the maritime
industry has become a new economic growth point for coastal
Chinese provinces and regions including Shandong, Liaoning,
Zhejiang, Fujian, Guangdong and Guangxi. The maritime sector in
nearly all these places had a growth rate exceeding 10 percent in
1998.
</P>
<P>
The year 1998 was designated by the United Nations as the
International Ocean Year. The State Oceanic Administration
completed the paper "The Development of China's Maritime Industry"
in the year, which the State Council issued as a white paper on
the development of China's maritime programs on May 29, 1998.
</P>
<P>
This shows that the China attaches great importance to marine
development and protection, as a major developing country with a
long coastline.
</P>
<P>
Achievements have also been made in revitalizing the maritime
industry through science and technology. China has established 16
demonstration bases and eight technology-transfer centers
nationwide to boost development of the maritime sector.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a Chinese expedition to the South Pole reached 4,000
meters above sea level, the highest point of the Antarctica ice
cap, and reports say that China is planning to send teams of
explorers to the North Pole.

<HEADLINE> International Name-Brand Products Cutting Prices in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Many international name-brand
products including Omega, Rolex, and Hugo Boss showed great
interest in cutting their usually high prices during the Chinese
lunar New Year known as Spring Festival in order to attract more
Chinese customers.
</P>
<P>
Both Omega and Rolex watches were sold as a discount rate
ranging from 20 to 30 percent, and Boss ties, which ordinarily
sell for 1,000 yuan (about 120 U.S. dollars) or above, could be
bought for around 350 yuan at sales counter in major Beijing
stores.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that prices for these products are too
expensive for common salary earners, but retailers have been
unwilling to cut their prices in Beijing stores. However, they
have now tasted the sweet success of the Spring Festival sales.
</P>
<P>
The consumer-products price wars still continue in Beijing
after the Spring Festival, and experts say these wars must be
cooled down and unjustified competition must be stopped.

MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will

<TEXT>
<P>
ASMARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Captured or surrendered Ethiopian
soldiers have revealed that there were forced conscripts in the
Ethiopian army, the official Eritrean News Agency Erina reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The captured Ethiopian soldiers said the Ethiopian officials
forced young school students to the front with a promise of
regular salaries and an assurance that they would not have to
fight.
</P>
<P>
The prisoners of war (POWs), many of whom were forced
conscripts, said they had been promised a monthly salary of 600
birr (about 86 U.S. dollars) each, but had received little or no
money at all.
</P>
<P>
The Eritrean News Agency said Eritrean forces even discovered
the body of a 13-year-old boy among the corpses of Ethiopian
soldiers, whose pockets revealed a letter from his mother and his
entry paper into the 7th grade.
</P>
<P>
It also quoted a Sudanese student, James Lual Mokacha, as
saying that he and his friends were forcibly taken from their town
inside Sudan along the border by Ethiopian officials.
</P>
<P>
At a briefing to the diplomatic community in Asmara Tuesday
evening, Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae cllaimed there
were more than 200 foreign mercenaries in the Ethiopian army.
</P>
<P>
The minister said he was worried about an impending offensive
Ethiopia would launch against Eritrea 10 days after Eritrea
accepted the framework agreement of the Organization of African
Unity (OAU), and requested the international community to condemn
Addis Ababa and stop its venture.
</P>
<P>
Referring to this, Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi
expressed his "scepticism" at Eritrea's acceptance of the peace
plan put forward by the OAU.
</P>
<P>
Addis Ababa insists that theOAU peace plan demands Eritrea's
withdrawal from all contested zones, but Asmara maintains that it
refers only to Badme and its environs.

<HEADLINE> Opportunities for Foreign Investors in China's Offshore Oil Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An oil official of China says a
great deal more foreign cooperation is needed to explore for
offshore oil and gas reserves, though the country has already had
over 130 contracts with 18 countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Wei Liucheng, president of the China National Offshore Oil Corp
(CNOOC), told Xinhua here today that analysts believe that China
has huge offshore oil and gas resources, which is estimated at 25
billion tons and 14 trillion cu m, respectively.
</P>
<P>
However, the proven offshore oil and gas reserves in China
account for only five percent of the country's total estimated
resources, said Wei.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that only by dramatically increasing Sino-foreign
cooperation in the sector, can China speed up its offshore oil and
gas development, which will at the same time provide huge
opportunities for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
According to Wei, foreign oil giants have shown intense
interest in investing in China's offshore oil and gas exploration.
To date, through Sino-foreign joint effort, China has sunk more
than 400 exploratory wells and verified nearly 100 oil and gas-
bearing structures.
</P>
<P>
The oil boss said that China gave priority to offshore oil
exploration last year amid declining oil prices and production
both at home and abroad, and it invited wide-ranging foreign
cooperation in oil and gas exploration in the South China Sea, the
East China Sea, and the Yellow Sea.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the CNOOC pumped 16.31 million tons of crude oil and 3.
8 billion cu m of natural gas.

SHENZHEN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Bill Gates, chairman of the
Microsoft Corp., today unveiled his grand plan, named "Venus", to
give Chinese users of regular TV sets access to on-line games,
software and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in Shenzhen, a special economic zone, Gates said, "By
delivering this technology in a low-cost and easy to use format,
we hope to increase access to educational software and ultimately
the Internet for Chinese consumers."
</P>
<P>
In the coming decade, according to Gates, most adults will be
able to use e-mail and be part of the network. Chinese people
cannot live without the Web as they cannot live without the
telephone and the television.
</P>
<P>
The "Venus" project is the best way to increase China's
integration into the networking era, an executive of Microsoft (
China) Co., Ltd. said.
</P>
<P>
The device in the project will be manufactured by Microsoft in
cooperation with partners in China including the Legend Group,
Stone Ginbin Co., Yuxing Electronics Group, Haier Group, Acer Inc.,
BBK Electronics Co., Ltd., Integrated Technology Express Inc., and
Philips Ltd.
</P>
<P>
China lags behind the world's current level of networking and
by the end of 1998 it had 2.1 million Internet users, which is an
equivalent of the size of a medium Internet service provider (ISP)
in the U.S. Global Internet users had reached 153 million by 1998.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, China is the largest market for household
electric appliances. It has 317 million TV sets, covering 90
percent of households and 40 million video compact disk players.
The national telephone coverage has reached 25 percent and in
cities is as high as 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The low costs and easy usage of Internet access provided by
the "Venus" project will create more markets for China's software
and Web service industries and help expand their business scale,"
said Sean Zhang, general manager of Microsoft China R&AMP;D Center.

<HEADLINE> Tens of Houses Set on Fire in Ambon, Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tens of houses in Benteng Atas
Village in Ambon, capital of Indonesia's Maluku Province, were set
on fire Wednesday morning following an attack from residents of
Taman Makmur Village.
</P>
<P>
Tens of families had to seek refugee at a church, but no
casualties have been reported.
</P>
<P>
According to Antara News Agency, most of the fire victims did
not have time to save their belongings.
</P>
<P>
Located about 2,300 kilometers east of Jakarta, Ambon has been
rocked by religious unrest that has killed more than 200 people
this year and forced thousands to flee.
</P>
<P>
Authorities said more than 400 others were injured since
religious clashes erupted in the province in mid-January.
</P>
<P>
In Ambon, about 60 percent of the residents are Christian while
most of the rest are Muslims, many of them immigrants from other
islands.
</P>
<P>
Calls mounted on Tuesday for hostile religious groups in Ambon
to keep cool as more lives were lost from the weeks of clashes.
</P>
<P>
"We call on people from both sides to put down their weapons
and work together to restore peace and order in Ambon," Ambon
Bishop Mandagi was quoted by The Jakarta Post Wednesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandagi represented a group of local religious leaders and
intellectuals from state Pattimura University who met earlier in
the day with Maj. Gen. Suaidy Marasabessy. The latter heads a
19-member special military task force assigned by Armed Forces
Commander Gen. Wiranto to stop the bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
Head of Maluku's Indonesian Council of Ulemas chapter Hasanussy
and Rev. Sammy Titalei of the Maluku Protestant Church also
attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Sudan Denies Involvement in Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Sudanese Foreign Minister
Mustafa Osman Ismail has said that the United States was wrong in
accusing Sudan of harboring terrorists.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the Turkish Daily News
published on Wednesday, Ismail said that Sudan would like to ask
the U.S. administration to send a fact-finding team to Khartoum to
investigate the allegations and the Sudanese government would
accept its verdict.
</P>
<P>
The minister also called on the international community to work
together to combat terrorism, which he described as a global
problem.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. launched a missile attack on a pharmaceutical factory
in Khartoum in retaliation for the bombings of its embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania on August 7, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Washington, which has been accusing Khartoum of sponsoring
international terrorism, alleged that the factory was
manufacturing chemical weapons that could be used by Islamic
militants to attack U.S. targets.
</P>
<P>
But the Sudanese government has repeatedly insisted that the
factory, which opened in 1996, produced about half of the
country's medicines, mainly antibiotics and drugs to treat malaria
and tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister arrived here on Monday for a three-day
official visit to Turkey in a bid to promote bilateral ties.

<P>
PARIS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading French newspapers on Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The acquittal of former French Prime Minister Laurent Fabius
and Minister of Social Affairs Georgina Dufoix by the Court of
Justice on Tuesday in the 1985 case of blood contamination by AIDS
has been strongly criticized by the victims of the contamination,
the political class and jurists. The decision by the court, which
is specialized in dealing with accusations against government
officials, was considered to have a highly political character.
</P>
<P>
-- From now on, all the pressure is exerted on the Yugoslav
authorities to make them accept the autonomous plan for Kosovo, a
few days from the resumption on March 15 of the conference on
Kosovo issue in Paris. The U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke was
once again sent to Belgrade to persuade Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic to accept the international peace plan while
warning him of "a tragedy" if he rejects it.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The verdict of the Court of Justice of France on three
former Socialist ministers charged with homicide in the 1985 blood
contamination by AIDS was strongly criticized by the association
of the victims of the contamination. Both the left-wing and right-
wing political camps have also raised their voice for a reform of
the court, which is in charge of trying government ministers
charged with crimes.
</P>
<P>
-- French police on Wednesday arrested in Paris several members
of the military wing of the Spanish Basque separatist group ETA,
including its chief Javier Arizeuren-Ruiz, also called "Kantauri",
who was accused of staging an assassination attempt on Spanish
King Carlos in 1995.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia May Formally Join ASEAN Next Month: Thai FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan said here Wednesday that it was likely that Cambodia
would be admitted into the Association of Southeast Asian Nations
(ASEAN) by the end of next month.
</P>
<P>
Surin, who chairs the ASEAN's Standing Committee, said
Cambodia's admission into the regional body should take place by
late April after Phnom Penh sets up the senate.
</P>
<P>
Other major problems would also have to be cleared, including
top Khmer Rouge leader Ta Mok, who was arrested by the Cambodian
government on Saturday, before the country would be given a seat
in the ASEAN, the Thai minister said.
</P>
<P>
The ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia is the only Southeast Asian country without ASEAN
membership.
</P>
<P>
The country should have joined the ASEAN in 1997 had not
political turmoil in July that year blocked its entry.
</P>
<P>
A 10-nation great ASEAN has always been the dream of the
regional organization. With Cambodia's admission, the ambitious
dream will become a reality.

<HEADLINE> U.S., Kuwait to Cooperate for Regional Security: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Visiting U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen said here Wednesday that the U.S. will
continue to cooperate with Kuwait to make the Gulf region secure.
</P>
<P>
"As long as Iraqi President Saddam Hussein chooses to threaten
its neighbors, the U.S. and Kuwait must continue to work together
closely to make the region secure," Cohen told a press conference
at the Kuwait Airport before concluding his two-day visit to the
Gulf emirate.
</P>
<P>
Referring to specific steps of the U.S.-Kuwaiti cooperation,
Cohen said that a direct telephone line will be opened between
him and his Kuwaiti counterpart Salem Al-Sabah Al-Salem Al-Sabah
to facilitate communications.
</P>
<P>
He said that Washington will share with Kuwait information on
chemical and biological weapons and others with the aim of
properly detecting and defending against the weapons.
</P>
<P>
"We also intend to share early-warning information from our
satellites on cruise missile testing in the region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. defense chief also reiterated the U.S. containment
policy on Iraq, saying "our policy in the region is clear, we are
working to contain Saddam Hussein from attacking its neighbors."
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the present international sanctions against
Iraq be maintained. It is "no time to ease up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Qatar expressed, during his visit in Doha Tuesday,
reservations about U.S.-led air strikes against Iraq, Cohen said
"we have a support from all Gulf countries."
</P>
<P>
Cohen is on his nine-nation Mideast tour to explain U.S. policy
on the region, especially on Iraq, and rally support.
</P>
<P>
He has visited Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Oman, the United Arab
Emirates (UAE), Qatar before coming to Kuwait. His tour also includes
stops in Egypt, Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
During his visit in the Gulf region, Cohen has announced
Washington's approval to sell the AMRAAM air-to-air missiles to
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the confrontations between Iraq's air defenses
and the U.S.-British warplanes enforcing the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq, Cohen stressed Sunday in Saudi
capital of Riyadh that the air strikes against Iraq "must
continue as long as Baghdad defies the no-fly zones."
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led Western allies imposed the no-fly zones following
the 1991 Gulf War triggered by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.

<HEADLINE> China's Private Firms Flex Muscle at Trade Fair (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's private firms have
eventually become direct players in foreign trade as their
representatives participated in an important trade fair for the
first time in their own names this week in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Jiangxi Liquid Industrial Chemicals Company, a private
enterprise from east Jiangxi Province, clinched a deal of nearly
800,000 US dollars with LG of the Republic of Korea at the '99
East China Fair, which will end on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"This is the first time that I have directly signed an order
with a foreign buyer since my company was established 14 years ago,
" Company Chairman Hu Zhengwu told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
For years private firms in China were officially barred from
direct involvement in foreign trade and were barely able to
participate in various trade activities in collaboration with
specialized foreign trade companies or other authorized
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
However, China granted the right to import and export to two
select groups of 61 private firms earlier this year in an effort
to boost exports.
</P>
<P>
"China's reforms and opening-up have enabled private firms to
spring up and grow and today the government has allowed us to flex
our muscles in the world market," Hu said. "The path for private
firms is getting wider and wider."
</P>
<P>
Wang Qunbin, General Manager of Shanghai Fortune Industrial Co.
Ltd., another private firm present at the fair, said "The granting
of import and export rights provides us with a passport to a
market a dozen times the size of the China's."
</P>
<P>
"So long as qualifications are met, China's door of foreign
trade will remain open to private firms forever," said Lu Jianhua,
Deputy Director of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic
Cooperation's Department of Economic and Foreign Trade Policy and
Development.
</P>
<P>
"We want to encourage well-positioned private firms to enter
the world market directly to pump new vitality into the foreign
trade sector and the entire national economy," Lu said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that China currently has more than 960,
000 private enterprises, which have 13.49 million employees and
reported 392.3 billion yuan in output value last year.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers of the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) will meet in Malaysia in
May to discuss cooperative growth strategies for supporting early
and sustained economic recovery in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Sixth APEC Finance Ministers Meeting to be held at
Langkawi, a resort island in the northern state of Kedah, on May
15 and 16 will focus on three priority areas -- strengthening
financial systems, promoting capital market development and
strengthening social safety nets, according to a press release
issued by Malaysia's Ministry of Finance here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the ministers will be considering various
proposals and recommendations and will exchange views among
themselves and with the heads of the International Monetary Fund,
the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank on global
developments and their implications for the region, it said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers will review efforts made thus far to strengthen
prudential regulation of financial institutions in industrialized
economies to promote safe and sustainable capital flows.
</P>
<P>
They will also review the progress of efforts to improve
standards of transparency and disclosure for private sector
financial institutions involved in international capital flows,
such as investment banks, hedge funds and other international
investors, it said.
</P>
<P>
"As host of the APEC Finance Ministers Meeting, Malaysia looks
forward to concrete and practical outcomes on key aspects relating
to reforms of the international financial architecture," it said.

<HEADLINE> China's Private Firms Flex Muscle at Trade Fair (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
China's private sector is most developed in the east and south.
In east Zhejiang Province, private firms had 1.2 billion US
dollars in "indirect" exports, which were done through foreign
trade companies, last year.
</P>
<P>
China's foreign trade needs the participation of not only its
20,000-plus state or collectively-owned specialized foreign trade
companies and 150,000 overseas-funded enterprises, but also the
participation of private firms, according to Wang Yaotian,
professor of the Shanghai Research Center of the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
"In the face of this year's tight international trade situation,
private firms will play a positive role in boosting China's
exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We were not able to meet the world market directly last year,
so many business opportunities were lost," said Hu of the Jiangxi
company.
</P>
<P>
"We plan to double our exports this year to five million US
dollars to make a greater contribution to our country," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
Many state-owned foreign trade companies at the fair reacted
calmly and positively to the direct involvement in trade by
private firms, considering it the "trend of development."
</P>
<P>
"Challenges from private firms will force us to deepen reform
and increase efficiency," said Yu Qiping, an experienced trader of
the Shanghai Oriental International Group, a state-owned foreign
trade company.
</P>
<P>
In recognition of the role of private firms, the National
People's Congress, China's legislature, is amending the
Constitution to define the non-public sector, including self-
employed and private businesses, as "an important component of the
country's socialist market economy". The private sector has been
up to now described as "a complement to the socialist economy of
public ownership".
</P>
<P>
Partly due to the Asian financial crisis, China's export growth
plunged to 0.5 percent last year, compared with 20.9 percent in
1997.
</P>
<P>
Premier Zhu Rongji last week called for "all possible means" to
boost exports to stimulate economic growth. China has set this
year's economic growth rate at around seven percent, down from 7.8
percent last year and 8.8 percent in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Gradually Withdraw Troops from S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria will gradually withdraw its
troops from Sierra Leone as peace is achieved in that country,
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalami Abubakar has said.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held Tuesday in capital Abuja with
visiting British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook and Sierra Leonean
President Tejan Kabbah, Abubakar said total withdrawal would
depend on how much peace is achieved in that country.
</P>
<P>
He assured Nigeria would not withdraw its troops serving in the
 west African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG in Sierra Leone before
 peace is restored.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar departed his earlier promises on many occasions to
withdraw Nigerian troops from Sierra leone before the hand-over of
power to a democratically-elected president on May 29.
</P>
<P>
The British foreign secretary who is on a four-day visit to
Nigeria told the press conference that Britain is strongly
committed to doing all it can as a nation to bring stability in
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah who arrived in Nigeria Monday night said he would
continue to pursue the option of dialog and negotiations, adding
he had signed an agreement with the rebel leaders and would do all
he could to implement it.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting in Abuja with Kabbah Tuesday, Nigerian
president-elect Olusegun Obasanjo restated that Nigerian soldiers
would not stay a day longer than necessary in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
However, the president-elect said: "we will not be
irresponsible and just withdraw Nigerian soldiers without making
sure that the situation in Sierra Leone is reasonably under
control."
</P>
<P>
He noted that "the solution to the Sierra Leonean problems will
 essentially be found by Sierra leoneans. But we want to give all
the helping hands that we can, particularly on the second track
which is the peace and reconciliation track."
</P>
<P>
According to him, the Sierra Leonean leader "has given us
assurance that this track will move at maximum speed."

<HEADLINE> China Strengthens Management of Trade in Endangered Species </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen the
management of the import and export of wild animals and plants to
better protect these species, according to China's Convention on
International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES) Authority.
</P>
<P>
China is now formulating regulations in this respect which are
expected to become effective this year, Zhen Rende, head of the
Authority, said.
</P>
<P>
The Authority also plans to join customs and public security
departments to crack down on the smuggling of wild animals and
plants in border areas such as Guangdong and Yunnan provinces and
the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Since 1981 when China signed the CITES, great efforts have been
made to strengthen control of the trade of wild animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Authority and the General Administration of
Customs jointly released a list of import and export wild animals
and plants, increasing varieties from five to more than 300.
</P>
<P>
Zhen admitted that though efforts have been made, the current
situation is not completely satisfactory, and noted that large
amount of domestic resources have been squandered.
</P>
<P>
"Excessive international trade is one element affecting the
country's ecological environment," said Zhen.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China now has 29,000 varieties of plants
and more than 400 varieties of animals covered in the CITES list
of endangered species.

<P>
CAIRO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
from Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Finance Ministry said Wednesday that the
state's revenue from December 1998 to February 1999 reached 7.625
billion U.S. dollars, a 3.2 percent increase in real terms over
the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Of the revenue, 4.125 billion U.S. dollars are from income and
property taxes and 3.3 billion dollars from value added taxes and
customs duties.
</P>
<P>
But collection from bonds declined by 6 percent compared with the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israeli Finance Ministry announced Tuesday its
plans to cancel the existing property tax as of January 1, 2000,
and to replace it with a 2.5 percent sales tax on land and
commercial buildings.
</P>
<P>
Under the plans, a 0.8 percent sales tax will be assessed on
the value of new residential apartments and the seller may offset
the earnings from his income, thus reducing the actual rate to
0.5 percent. Sales tax brackets for residential apartments will
begin at 3.5 percent, and at 5 percent for purchase of more than
one apartment.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- The Israel Manufacture Association Tuesday called
on 23 political parties campaigning in the May elections to
include an 18-point program to encourage economic growth in their
platforms.
</P>
<P>
The program includes setting economic goals on growth,
employment and price stability, operating appropriate economic,
fiscal and monetary policies, setting technological education as a
key goal and transferring real resources to support high-tech
industries
</P>
<P>
MANAMA -- The net profits of the Bahraini-Saudi Bank hit 3.5
million dinars (some 9.3 million dollars) last year, an increase
of 300,000 dollars over 1997, the Egyptian Al-Alam Al-Youm daily
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the increase to a higher interest rate
service, which went up 4 percent to reach 5.7 million dinars (12.2
million dollars).
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Iran will import 1.2 million tonnes of various iron
wares in the new Iranian calendar year starting on March 21, local
daily Tehran Times reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of National Iranian Steel Company Mostafa
Moazenzadeh said on Tuesday the imports will offset Iran's
insufficient iron production.

<HEADLINE> Study: Lower In-take of Fruits Causes Bad Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A low in-take of vegetables and
fruit before sleep may lead to bad health in spring, according to
Professor Witolt Zatonski from the Health Promotion Foundation of
Poland.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zatonski warned Tuesday that a person should eat at
least one kilogram of vegetables and fruit every day, taken in
five portions. He explained that this is because vitamin C cannot
be stored in the body and its density will decrease several hours
after people eat fruit.
</P>
<P>
The professor said that death rates fell by 10 percent from
1991 to 1998 in Poland because people ate more vegetables and
fruit.
</P>
<P>
He said that in Poland, a person drinks 20 liters of fruit
juice on average each year now, compared to almost nothing 10
years ago.
</P>
<P>
But this is far from enough, because only half of the
population eats raw fruit while vegetables are often regarded as
mere decorations on steaks, he added.
</P>
<P>
Professor Zatonski advised people not to be afraid of chemicals
on vegetables and fruit because he said chemicals, when used
properly, are harmless.

<HEADLINE> Two Giant Pandas Set for Hong Kong Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- "Jiajia" and "An'an", the two
giant pandas the Central Chinese Government will present as a gift
to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), were put
into cages at the China Research Center for Protection of Giant
Pandas, some 100 km away from Chengdu, capital of Sichuan Province,
today.
</P>
<P>
The two giant pandas will be flown to Hong Kong from Chengdu by
a cargo plane at midday of tomorrow and will settle down there. "
An'an", the male giant panda, is 13 years old. He lived a half
year in a Singaporean zoo as a friendly emissary in 1990 and
stayed another five years in Shenzhen Wildlife Park, Guangdong
Province.
</P>
<P>
According to Keeper Zhou Minghua, An'an, with a weight of over
130 kg, needs to eat more than 20 kg of bamboo shoots, two kg of
buns and a half kg of apples and carrots each day.
</P>
<P>
"The male giant panda is very docile and friendly to human
beings," said Zhou, who added that An'an is also a good performer
and never refuses to have his photos taken with visitors.
</P>
<P>
The 21-year-old Jiajia, on the other part, is hailed as an
heroic mother. She has lived in captivity for 18 years and has
given birth to six cubs, of which, four are still alive.
</P>
<P>
It is learned that the new homes for the two giant pandas in HK
cover an area of about 2,000 sq m and are akin to the usual
ecological environment for giant pandas living in wild conditions.
Construction of the dwellings cost 84 million Hong Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with reporters today, Zhang Guiquan, a giant
panda expert and also a senior vet, said the two giant pandas'
health would not be affected because of a change in their living
habitat.
</P>
<P>
The China Research Center for the Protection of Giant Pandas
was established inside the Wolong Giant Panda Reserve of Sichuan
Province in 1980, and funded by the Chinese Government and World
Wildlife Fund. It has so far successfully bred 24 giant pandas in
16 births through artificial means, of which 15 are still alive.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are one of the most famous endangered species and
it is estimated that there are about 1,000 left in the world, most
of them living in the mountains around the Sichuan Basin of
southwest China.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chevron, the US oil giant, is to
commit 60 million US dollars in its China upstream operations of
oil and gas exploration and development over the next two years.
</P>
<P>
The company plans to drill six wildcats in 1999, three in the
Bohai Sea, one in Zhanhuadong off the Shengli oilfield, one in
Yacheng and the last in the Huizhou oilfield, said Rob Lagaay,
managing director of the Asia Business Unit of Chevron Overseas
Petroleum Inc.
</P>
<P>
Discussing the development of the petrochemical sector in China,
he said that Chevron has already invested 90 million US dollars in
a polystyrene plant with an annual capacity of 100,000 tons. The
plant, currently under construction in Zhangjiagang, east China's
Jiangsu province, is scheduled to become operational in the first
quarter of 2000.
</P>
<P>
In evaluating the China market, Mr. Lagaay said that the steady
development of China's economy has provided a favorable investment
environment and Chevron has great confidence in this market and
its opening up policy. "Chevron certainly has no plans to change
its 20-25-year long term development plan in China." he added.
</P>

Chevron is now one of the biggest foreign investors in China's
oil and gas exploration and development.

<HEADLINE> Japan Asked to Open Market for Economic Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's central bank
governor Wednesday asked Japan to open its market to cheaper
imports from Southeast Asia to help Asian economies' recovery.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese yen's depreciation could indirectly aid Asian
economies' recovery but Japan could contribute more effectively to
the recovery in Asia by allowing access to its market, Bank Negara
Malaysia Governor Ali Abul Hassan said at the 21st joint
conference of Malaysian-Japan Economic Associations here
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the yen would improve Japan's export
competitiveness and contribute to its economic recovery, Ali said,
adding that this would indirectly help Asian economies which look
upon Japan as the anchor economy.
</P>
<P>
But, it would be likely that Asian countries' trade deficit
with Japan would grow, he said.
</P>
<P>
A more effective approach in aiding Asian economies' recovery
would be that Japan opens its market to cheaper imports from
Southeast Asia, Ali said.
</P>
<P>
The governor said that while the Miyazawa initiative provides
financing for recovery, a more liberal trade and economic regime
in Japan would ensure that these funds contribute to long-term
sustainable growth in Asian economies.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Historical Human Rights Record (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The head of Tibet's historical
archives Suonam Geleik has revealed that before the democratic
reform in 1959, the three major feudal groupings of old Tibet --
the grand living Buddha, higher government officials and the
nobility -- often used human body parts in religious activities.
</P>
<P>
Even as late as the end of the 1940s, the old Tibetan local
government of Kasha issued a decree to administrative bodies
advising them that the Dalai Lama would celebrate his birthday at
the end of a 12-year cycle of the Chinese zodiac. He ordered them
to send gifts of human skulls, fresh human blood and complete
human skins as well as internal organs to celebrate the Dalai's
birthday and that they should also recite the scriptures on that
auspicious day.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, this decree is still proscribed to this day in the
archives of Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
And among the great number of historical records stored in the
archives are documents recording the use of live human beings as
sacrifices in religious activities, which were apparently common
occurrences, Suonam went on.
</P>
<P>
Tibet's historical archives were gathered together in the 1960s
and located in a library in the western suburbs of Lhasa, the
regional capital. The library covers two hectares and has a floor
space of 9,000 sq m.
</P>
<P>
It houses more than three million books recording historical
events dating back as early as the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)
through to the 1950s. It is one of the most well-stocked library
archives in the country.
</P>
<P>
An example of the outdated practices was noted by reporters who
recently visited the library who read about one particular "
Contract on the Transfer of Slaves" which was actually dated 1948.
It bore the fingerprint of a slave called Zhaxi Toinzhub.

<HEADLINE> Xinjiang to Boost Foreign Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This represents a 4.6 percent increase from last year's figure.
The resource-rich region's foreign trade has been growing steadily,
according to Liu Yi, director of the local Department of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang will expand new markets in Africa, Europe, Americas,
Oceanic, and Russia, while consolidating the traditional markets
in southeast Asia including Hong Kong, Japan and the Republic of
Korea, Liu said.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will be placed on the processing trade of textiles,
crude oil, rubber, non-ferrous metal and chemicals, using the
resources from neighboring countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
And Xinjiang will encourage the export of machinery equipment,
products with a high added-value, and brand-name products, Liu
said, adding that the region is an important exporter of cotton.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, the region welcomes foreign investment in
basic industries such as energy, water control and communications,
and pillar industries such as petro-chemicals and agriculture, Liu
said.

A document from the archives shows that in 1949, three thralpa
(monks), who served as slaves to kanpo (ecclesiastical officials

local prison where their eyes were gouged out, noses cut off and

<P>
But in today's Tibet, young people from such backgrounds are
not discriminated against at all.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, some of them have been elected as deputies to people's
congresses to participate in government affairs or as members of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at
various levels to give advice on government work, fully exercising
their respective democratic rights. Some others have even been
appointed to be leaders of local governments at various levels in
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
For example, Purpu, whose family has made ceremonial Tibetan
daggers through many generations in Lhaze County of Xigaze
Prefecture, said :"There has never been a time in history where
Tibetans enjoyed such full human rights and fundamental freedoms
as they do today, nor was my family as respected by the society."
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Reform in 1959 abolished feudal serfdom and ever
since then the Tibetan people, like people of other nationalities
in China, have become their own masters, and in control of the
state. They have obtained all political rights that the
Constitution and laws freely provides to China's citizens.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans, who now stand up politically proud, have also
witnessed a fast economic expansion. The Central Government has
always looked upon the task of helping the people of Tibet have
enough food and clothing as an important task. It redistributed
all the farmland, pastures, forests, mountains and rivers, as well
as most of the livestock, which used to be owned by the nobles,
the grand living Buddha and higher government officials - which
only accounted for five percent of the total Tibetan population -
to the poor serfs and slaves that made up the remaining 95 percent
of the population.
</P>
<P>
Since 1978 the state has introduced a long-term revival policy,
and has given local farmers and herdsmen exemption from
agricultural and animal husbandry taxes.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that by 1998, the annual income of
Tibetan urban residents was 5,410 yuan, and per capita annual net
income of farmers and herdsmen reached 1,150 yuan. Living space of
urban residents is 14 sq m and that of rural farmers and pastoral
herdsmen is 23.6 sq m.

BELGRADE -- As peace efforts are going on, fresh fighting has
erupted in Kosovo, where Yugoslav forces battled ethnic Albanian
rebels in the Kacanik region on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was in retaliation to attacks launched on Monday
and Tuesday by ethnic Albanian rebels with automatic rifles,
antitank grenades and mortars, according to the Pristina
Information Center. Yugoslavia's official news agency Tanjug
reported that ethnic Albanian rebels on Monday killed two
policemen and wounded three others on patrol duty in Djakovica
region. (Kosovo-Fighting)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary John Hamre on
Tuesday warned Congress of an "electronic Pearl Harbor" by cyber-
terrorists and said the target is more likely to be commercial
than military.
</P>
<P>
Even though its computer network is penetrated by computer
hackers as often as 10 to 15 times a day, the Defense Department
thinks it has done a good job of protecting vital national
security interests, Hamre said. Hamre told the Senate Armed
Services Committee that all the computer intrusions so far have
been against non-sensitive portions of the Pentagon computer
system. (US-Pentagon-Computer Terrorism)

WASHINGTON -- U.S. NASA's star research mission has come to an
end after the failure of the satellite telescope, the Associated
Press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite telescope, called Wide-field Infrared Explorer,
was launched on March 4 with the intention of studying the history
of galaxies and stars. However, shortly after the satellite
entered its second orbit, the ground stations detected it spinning
rather than maintaining a stable orientation. NASA officials said
that they could not save the mission, but would continue their
efforts to bring its satellite under control and determine what
went wrong. (US-Satellite-Failure)

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Formally Accepts Mines Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan has formally accepted
the amended Protocol II on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use
of Mines, Booby-Traps and Other Devices of the Certain
Conventional Weapons (CCW) Convention, an official press release
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan's Notification of Consent to be bound by the protocol
was conveyed to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The formal acceptance by Pakistan of the amended Protocol II
reflects its firm commitment toward the humanitarian cause of
preventing innocent civilians from the scourge of anti-personnel
mines (APMs)," said the press release.
</P>
<P>
Unlike its original version, the amended Protocol II covers the
use of APMs also in internal conflicts and stipulates a complete
ban on the use of mines without detectable, self-destruction and
self-deactivation mechanisms by the year 2007.
</P>
<P>
The indiscriminate use of mines kill or maim an estimated
25,000 innocent civilians every year across the world.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan, one of the current 71 state parties to the CCW
Convention, signed the convention in 1982 and ratified it in April
1985.
</P>
<P>
The amended Protocol II will enter into force for Pakistan on
September 8, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Protocol II, as amended on May 3, 1996, took effect on December
3, 1998, and was amended to further regulate the use of
anti-personnel mines.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Stock Exchange Index Up in February </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Tel Aviv Stock Exchange
(TASE) index rose by 3 percent in February and the bonds index
remained unchanged, compared with January, said the TASE in a
report Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Total daily turnover in stocks averaged 45 million U.S.
dollars, down 20 percent over January, while average daily trade
in bonds rose to 65 million dollars from 32.5 million dollars in
January, it said.
</P>
<P>
There were no public issues of stocks in February, but as part
of the privatization program, 2.5 percent of stakes in the
state-owned Bank Leumi was sold to Lehman Brothers for 52.5
million dollars in a deal outside the stock exchange, it said.
</P>
<P>
Gross government capital raised on the bonds market was 375
million dollars in February, a 40 percent decrease compared with
January, the report added.
</P>
<P>
International investors were showing interest in the
government's privatization, which planned to sell 14 percent of
the Telephone Company Bezeq's stakes at 92.5 million dollars in
April, it said.
</P>
<P>
TASE noted that the privatization of Israel's banks is
continuing, with the government planning to sell another 2
percent of its stakes in Bank Leumi to Lehman Brothers in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
Despite the drop in the number of issues in recent months, the
TASE's allure has not declined and large, high-quality companies
continue to be a source of attraction for foreign and local
investors.

<HEADLINE> Temperatures Abnormally High in China Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Temperatures in most parts of
China were abnormally high last year, and the climate will
continue to turn warmer, according to the China Meteorological
Administration.
</P>
<P>
The average temperatures in major areas, except parts of
northeastern, western and southwestern China, were one to two
degrees centigrade higher than previous years, hitting the highest
or the second highest records in the past 50 years, the
administration said in a newly-released '98 China Climate Bulletin.
</P>
<P>
Last year witnessed the warmest autumn since 1949 and
experienced the twelfth warmest winter since 1987. Due to abnormal
temperatures, three isotherms of 12, 16 and 20 Celsius were found
to have moved northwards for 200 to 300 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
Winter temperatures last year were one to two degrees above
average in the North and 0.5 to one degree above average in the
South.

<HEADLINE> Least Typhoons Attack China Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Only three tropical storms struck

SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's economy has been

sales reached 96.6 percent, according to statistics from the
municipal bureau of statistics.
</P>
<P>
A total of 233 foreign-funded projects were approved by the
city, involving 753 million US dollars in foreign investment, up
42.1 percent.

<HEADLINE> Problems in China's Dairy Industry to be Solved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- An industry expert has pointed
out that China must tackle three dairy-industry problems to fully
tap its potential.
</P>
<P>
As a result of market analysis, he said, the first key to
expanding the market is to nurture the habit of dairy-product
consumption.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey conducted among customers at major department
stores in Shanghai reveals that more than 60 percent of the
customers say they "don't drink milk everyday."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's annual per capita consumption of
milk is 6 kilograms, whereas that of Japan and India is more than
60 kilograms, and the world's average is 103 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Dairy products are gaining popularity in major Chinese cities,
however. In Beijing, Shanghai and Xi'an, milk and yogurt have
become two favorites in summer.
</P>
<P>
Nearly half the people of Shanghai drink milk with breakfast,
and the annual per capita consumption in the city has reached 20
kilograms.
</P>
<P>
However, most people complain that milk "does not taste good,"
the analysis reports. Taste should be included in the quality
standard of dairy products, and this is the second key to the
development of the industry.
</P>
<P>
The third key is to make every effort to improve the quality of
the milk resources, the expert noted.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Urbanites Pay More Attention to Afforestation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A survey conducted by the
National Administration of Forestry (NAF) and the Horizon Market
Research Group shows that 73 percent of China's urban residents
have been paying more attention to ecological and environmental
problems during the past several years.
</P>
<P>
A major reason for this changing attitude is the severe natural
disasters such as last summer's floods, said the survey of more
than 1000 residents of six large and medium-sized cities.
</P>
<P>
These results are in accord with another Horizon survey, said a
Horizon's official, which showed that ecological problems are
listed in the top five issues of general concern among Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Among the choices of indispensable items for an ideal life, 80
percent were concentrated on natural resources such as clean air
and clear water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, only 7.7 percent of those surveyed said that economic
development is most important, while more than 90 percent
preferred a policy of balanced development.
</P>
<P>
The Horizon Group found, however, that many urban residents had
little knowledge in this respect, with nearly one half unaware of
the exact date of the National Tree-Planting Day, the survey said.

<HEADLINE> China Combats Judicial and Procuratorial Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Redoubled efforts from China's
courts and procuratorial bodies to fight against internal
corruption achieved good results last year, according to work
reports delivered by the nation's top prosecutor Han Zhubin and
top judge Xiao Yang today.
</P>
<P>
Massive education and rectification programs were launched last
year among judicial and procuratorial officials, in response to
suggestions and criticisms the nation's legislators made last
March regarding work by courts and procuratorial bodies.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, said that a
total of 28 leading officials at local courts were punished last
year, with three of them prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
Han Zhubin, head of the Supreme People's Procuratorate (SPP),
said that his institution has inspected and examined all
procuratorial and anti-corruption officials at prefecture and
county levels last year as part of a reshuffle program, which aims
to reinforce procuratorial and anti-corruption forces.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China's courts dealt with a total of 2,512
law-breaking or discipline-breaching judges and court officials
last year, with 221 of them prosecuted. And another 4,221
unqualified officials were fired.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorial bodies investigated a total of 1,641 prosecutors
suspected of having broken laws and breached disciplines. Of the
total, 116 were prosecuted and 1,285 disciplined.
</P>
<P>
The highest-ranking procuratorial official investigated and
penalized last year was Luo Ji, director of the Anti-Corruption
Bureau under the SPP before his removal. Luo Ji severely breached
disciplines concerning the management of confiscated money and
goods and was removed from office, Han said.
</P>
<P>
Courts and procuratorial bodies also opened their work to
supervision by people, through sponsoring seminars and publicizing
reporting phones, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, they took a series of measures to consolidate their
working systems and improve internal and external supervision
systems.
</P>
<P>
Also, some misjudged cases and questionable cases were re-
examined and the results of them rectified. Courts and
procuratorial bodies also disengaged themselves from business
operations in accordance with a decision by the central
authorities last year.
</P>
<P>
Defects and problems still exist in spite of favorable results
achieved in the anti-corruption program last year, Xiao Yang and
Han Zhubin said in their reports, adding that it still remains a
long-term and arduous task to eliminate corruption by court and
procuratorial officials.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Study Disputes Fat-Breast Cancer Link </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A study released Tuesday shows
that eating less fat does not appear to reduce a woman's risk of
developing breast cancer, contradicting current medical theories.
</P>
<P>
The study tracked 88,795 women in the continuing Nurses' Health
Study. The women, ages 30 to 55, completed detailed questionnaires
about their eating habits every four years from 1980 to 1994.
</P>
<P>
"Our research indicates it is highly unlikely that women who
consume a low-fat diet are protected against breast cancer," said
Michelle Holmes, the leading author of the study who is currently
an instructor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham
and Women's Hospital in Boston.
</P>
<P>
"Women should make decisions about their fat intake based on
preventing other diseases, such as heart disease," Holmes said in
a report published in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
The theory that dietary fat is linked to breast cancer arose
from the observation that breast-cancer rates are far lower in
traditional Asian cultures, where diets are generally low in fat.
</P>
<P>
Compared with women in Western cultures, traditional Asian
women start menstruating later, give birth at a younger age and
gain far less weight in adulthood -- all factors that decrease
breast-cancer risk, Holmes noted.
</P>
<P>
Experts, however, were quick to note that a low-fat diet is
still good for the heart and other aspects of health. They said
the study indicates a need to look more carefully at how diet may
affect the risk of breast cancer.
</P>
<P>
"We should just accept that good scientists can't tell you yet
what to eat to minimize your breast-cancer risk," said Dr. John A.
Glaspy of the University of California at Los Angeles, who was not
involved in the research.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Urged to Ban 7 Antibiotics From Livestock </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-seven health and
consumer groups on Tuesday urged the U.S. government to ban the
use of seven antibiotics in livestock, arguing the practice may
risk human health.
</P>
<P>
The seven antibiotics are penicillin, tetracycline,
erythromycin, tylosin lincomcycin, virginaiamycin and bacitracin,
which are used for humans and animals.
</P>
<P>
The 37 groups, led by the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, petitioned the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to ban the seven antibiotics from agricultural use.
</P>
<P>
U.S. farmers routinely add doses of antibiotics to livestock
feed to help animals grow faster. The health and consumer groups
say some bacteria can eventually outsmart the drugs and become
resistant to them.
</P>
<P>
Humans can then contract infections by eating or handling meat
contaminated with the superbugs, they added.
</P>
<P>
Reports say the FDA is taking public comments on its proposals
for animal drugs and is considering a plan to make animal drug
companies test for resistant bacteria before and after they
approach the agency for approval.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, the agency could decide to remove a drug from
the animal market based on how much resistant bacteria it promoted,
reports added.

A local strategist pointed out that Japan's moves are an
attempt for it to "find alibis to allow itself a bigger military
role. "The pre-emptive attack itself is a serious threat to the
outside world," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that Japan-U.S. security cooperation is a
special bilateral defense arrangement formed in the backdrop of
the Cold War. The revised Japan-U.S. Security Agreement, however,
showed the proneness it had displayed to expand its sphere and
contents. "It is inevitable that the new document will arouse
attention from neighbors," the strategist said.
</P>
<P>
There has been a move recently to attempt to incorporate Taiwan
into the TMD, an act which, according to Chinese Foreign Minister
Tang Jiaxuan, constitutes a violation of China's sovereignty and
territorial integrity, and puts an obstacle in the path of China's
peaceful reunification cause. "Thus it will be strongly opposed by
the whole Chinese people, including the people in Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
During the post-cold war era, characterized by peace and
development, any stubborn insistence of a cold-war mentality, and
any acts like stationing and proliferating strategic weapon
systems will do nothing but destroy the regional security balance,
and arouse universal condemnations from all peace-loving nations.
</P>
<P>
Having suffered from Japan's colonial rule in history, the east
and southeastern Asian nations have therefore kept a close watch
on every step Japan takes.
</P>
<P>
It is the hope of all those nations that Japan will maintain
its peaceful development and adhere to its current defense policy,
thus truly establishing a friendly image that seeks to establish
goodwill with all its neighbors.

<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The defense rhetoric and actions
recently taken by Japan have aroused wide concern and uneasiness
among East and Southeastern countries including China. All
countries concerned have been monitoring Japan's movements, which
could have a profound impact on regional and global security.
</P>
<P>
Hosei Norota, director-general of Japanese Defense Agency,
claimed that Japan could launch preemptive attacks on enemy
targets, saying that constitutional explanation for such moves is
"justified."
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao used the word "
surprised" to describe such remarks. "Such rhetoric not only runs
counter to the current trend of maintaining peace and stability,
but also would lead to new confrontations and tensions in the
region and deepen the disturbed feelings of Japan's neighbors," he
said in an open statement.
</P>
<P>
Cheon Yong-taek, the defense minister of the Republic of Korea,
also "firmly opposed such an idea," labeling it "very, very
dangerous."
</P>
<P>
The irresponsible words also invoked intense response from the
northern part of the Korean peninsula. Rodong Sinmun, the media
mouthpiece of DPRK's ruling Workers' Party, published an editorial
Tuesday, identifying Hosei's remarks as "a tone of warlike
aggression."
</P>
<P>
It is not the first time for neighboring countries to protest
to similar improper remarks made by Japanese senior officials. A
Japanese cabinet member was seriously criticized in January for
wantonly dragging in Russia, the Korean Peninsula, China and China'
s Taiwan into its "neighboring situation". Moreover, the decision
by the Japanese government to launch 4 military satellites before
the year 2002 and to participate in the U.S.'s Theater Missile
Defense (TMD) also met with severe denunciation from neighboring
countries.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees Kenya as Safe for Tourists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The United States Embassy in
Nairobi has told American tourists not to worry about their
security, citing that Kenya is one of the safest countries in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
Information Officer Chris Schaff of the embassy said in Kenya
foreign tourists can enjoy their holiday without hitches, the
Eastern African Standard reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Schaff said last week's attack in Uganda where eight tourists
were killed by Hutu rebels should not be linked to Kenya.
</P>
<P>
"Tourists should not be scared to visit Kenya. We have many
visitors from the States enjoying the country's facilities at the
moment," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he urged tour agencies to inform tourists about the
geographical differences of the east African region, saying many
potential American tourists assume Uganda to be like Kenya.
</P>
<P>
On March 8, officials of the Kenya Tourism Federation said the
Hutu attack at the Bwindi National Park in southwestern Uganda had
led to cancellations of travel arrangements by some tourists
destined for Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Foreigners' Registration Exercise Suspended in Ghana </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Ghana's Immigration authorities
have frozen registration of aliens in the country "until further
notice", citing lack of effective public education.
</P>
<P>
William K. Aboah, director of immigration, who ordered the
immediate suspension of the exercise Tuesday, said some people
have been going round misconstruing the rationale behind the
exercise to the aliens and in some cases extorting money from
them, the Ghana News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
This has created tension and panic among the alien community,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Aboah said from discussions and comments on the exercise from
the public, "it appears that the aims and objectives of the
exercise have not been well understood.''
</P>
<P>
It has, therefore, become necessary to suspend the
registration, to allow ample time for public education to foster a
better understanding of the exercise.
</P>
<P>
"The public education will go a long way to reverse the
misrepresentation and distortions that have been given to the
exercise," said the official.
</P>
<P>
The director warned that any individual arrested for any act
that will bring the activities of the Ghana Immigration Service
into disrepute would be dealt with according to the law.
</P>
<P>
The exercise which started Monday was expected to give
foreigners confidence that they are registered in the west African
country.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Strong Complaint Against U.S. Ban of Satellite Sale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China expressed "strong
displeasure" at the United States administration's rejection of a
satellite sale to a China-Singapore company, Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation (MOFTEC) spokesman Hu Chusheng said
here today.
</P>
<P>
"We lodged a strong complaint against the U.S. administration's
decision to reject an export license for a satellite sale to the
Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications under the excuse of foreign
affairs policy and national security interests," Hu said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman urged the U.S. administration to take an overall
view of Sino-U.S. relations, and correct its erroneous decision,
saying it is "groundless and will have a negative effect on normal
China-U.S. economic and trade exchanges and cooperation."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. administration's policy against exports to China will
not help solve the imbalance in bilateral trade, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific Mobile Telecommunications was jointly
established with investments from China, Singapore, Japan,
Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The company's purchase of a satellite from Hughes Electronics
of the United States is for civilian mobile telecommunications use
in the Asian-Pacific region, and therefore is conducive to
economic development in the region," Hu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Companies in China and the United States have strictly followed
international norms in the trading and launching of civilian-use
satellites for a long time, which, Hu said, is but a normal
international business transaction and is in accord with the
interests of both China and the United States.

<HEADLINE> China Developing Super Space Telescope </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists are working on
a spectrum telescope that can observe about 4,000 celestial bodies
at the same time.
</P>
<P>
"This will be the world's most powerful spectrum space
telescope for multi-target observation," said Su Dingqiang, an
academician with the Chinese Academy of Sciences and a specialist
on astronomical instruments, who is here attending the National
People's Congress, China's highest legislature, that has been in
session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
"It will contribute substantively to the research on the
conditions and changing patterns of galaxies and the universe when
it is built and put in use," he said.
</P>
<P>
The telescope, whose draft design has been completed, has a
four-meter caliber which can cover a vision range 5 degrees in
diameter, Su said.
</P>
<P>
Research and building of the telescope is carried out jointly
by the Beijing Astronomic Observatory and the Nanjing Research and
Manufacturing Center for Astronomic Instruments, with a cost
estimated at about 235 million yuan (about 29 million U.S. dollars)
.
</P>
<P>
It will be completed by the year 2004, said Su, who is the
technical consultant for the project along with the noted
astronomer Wang Shouguan.
</P>
<P>
Currently the most powerful telescope with super-large vision
range in the world was built and put in use by the United States
two years ago. It has a 2.5-meter caliber and can take records of
the spectrums of 660 celestial bodies at a time, according to Su.
</P>
<P>
"China has mastered the core technology for building such
telescopes and has made breakthroughs in several key fields," Su
said, adding that scientists are working to solve problems
centering on instrumental precision and optical fiber technology.
</P>
<P>
Scientists around the world have discovered and recorded
several billions of celestial bodies but have obtained the
spectrum of only one of every 10,000 of them.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia will announce
further measures that will strengthen the central bank's
supervisory role in the banking sector, Bank Negara Malaysia
Governor Ali Abul Hassan Sulaiman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The measures will include empowering Bank Negara to take
preemptive steps in cases where operations of banking institutions
can affect their future solvency and hence, the safety of their
deposits, the governor said at the 21st joint conference of
Malaysian-Japan Economic Associations here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The capital adequacy framework will be further refined to
impose minimum capital adequacy ratio, he said, adding that the
refinement in the framework will depend on the risk profile of
individual banking institutions' assets, including risk
concentration in terms of exposure to single customer and economic
factors.
</P>
<P>
He said the setting up of a deposit insurance scheme will also
be studied and the restructuring of the banking sector is being
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Ali said that with improving consumer and business sentiments,
coupled with prudence in financing and fiscal expansion, the
prospects for sustainable economic growth in 1999 and 2000 are
"bright."
</P>
<P>
The central bank is expected to release its 1998 annual report
at the end of this month, in which its assessment of the economic
outlook for 1999 will be announced.

MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada Tuesday night urged developers and investors of the
country's economic zones to do more in generating job
opportunities, especially for the poor.
</P>
<P>
In his speech during the forth anniversary celebration of the
Philippine Economic Zone Authority, he appealed to the managers of
the economic zones to enhance their employment efforts and skills

</P>
<P>
He cited the fact that despite the Asian economic crisis, the
country's 56 economic zones attracted investments of 2.4 billion
U.S. dollars last year and created thousands of jobs.
</P>
<P>
"An increase in economic zone investment immediately translates
to an increase in economic zone employment," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Economic zone investments also create employment opportunities
in enterprises outside the zone, such as raw materials suppliers,
subcontractors, construction companies and other services
providers," he added.
</P>
<P>
He said the economic zones' strong performance only proves that
they are "eco-shields" against the regional financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Constitutional Amendment on Private Economy Hailed (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen years ago, Chen Huajiao,
who left a state factory and started her own business, labeled her
private firm as a collectively-owned one for fear of prejudice
from the public.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the private businesswoman is examining proposed
amendments to the Constitution with other deputies to the National
People's Congress, in session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
A draft to partially revise the Constitution is being
deliberated by the ongoing session of the NPC. The draft proposes
writing into the Constitution "Self-employed, private and other
non-publicly-owned economies operating within the scope as allowed
by law are important components of a socialist market economy."
</P>
<P>
NPC deputies and members of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, who are
attending their respective annual sessions here, responded
positively to the proposed constitutional amendment regarding the
status of the non-public sector. They agree that the amendment, if
adopted by the NPC, will exert a far-reaching positive influence
over the prospects of the private economy and China's economy as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
The "important components" wording in the draft amendments is
an inevitable result of 20-year-long mind emancipation, economic
restructuring and economic development, according to NPC deputies
and CPPCC members.
</P>
<P>
Professor Xu Chuanglan, a CPPCC member from Lanzhou University,
commented, "The move reflects the spirit of seeking truth from
facts."
</P>
<P>
Another CPPCC member and a well-known farmer-turned animal feed
producer Liu Yonghao termed the proposed amendment as being "in
conformity with realities in China and the will of the people".
</P>
<P>
After the founding of New China, the authorities sought a high
proportion of a publicly-owned economy to the exclusion of
economies of other ownership forms. Since the country's reform
opening-up programs began in late 1978, the central authorities
have adopted a series of new policies to encourage the revival of
non-public economies, including private businesses.

<HEADLINE> Proposed Constitutional Amendment on Private Economy Hailed (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the first half of last year, the number of self-employed
operations and private businesses in the country had reached 28.51
million and 1.04 million, respectively, with a total registered
capital of more than 1,000 billion yuan and a total workforce of
70 million. The non-public economy has become a major source of
employment and tax money. By the year 2010, the non-public
economic sector is expected to account for one third of China's
GDP.
</P>
<P>
In Wenzhou City, a pioneer in developing a private economy in
east China's Zhejiang Province, private businesses have a 80-90
percent dominance of the local economy. In recent years, the
booming private sector, including over 5,200 private firms and
nearly 200,000 self-employed operations, has provided some two
million jobs. The sector has offered jobs to more than 100,000
laid off workers from local state factories.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a CPPCC member and a professor from Beijing
University, said only competition by economies of different
ownership forms can bring vitality to a market economy. "
Legalizing the status of the private sector will be of great
importance for improving and reinvigorating a market economy. And
it will also encourage overseas investors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Dejiang, secretary of Zhejiang's provincial Party
committee, said China is in a primary stage of socialism and its
fundamental task is to develop productive forces. To allow and
protect the existence and development of self-employed and private
economies is an objective, inevitable requirement and conforms
with realities.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC deputies and CPPCC members proposed that once the
amendment is adopted, specific laws and regulations should be
enacted to create a better environment for private businesses to
compete with enterprises of other ownership forms on an equal
footing.
</P>
<P>
As the private sector is entering a new stage of development,
state enterprises have to speed up their restructuring, accelerate
the pace of reform, and increase their own competitiveness, said
Li Guojin, an NPC deputy and general manager of an enterprise
group from Wuhan.
</P>
<P>
Governor Lu Ruihua of south China's Guangdong Province pledged
to further develop a fair, equal and comfortable environment for
enterprises of different ownership forms to develop. Guangdong is
a major reform pioneer and has the largest private economy in the
country.

<HEADLINE> Tibet's Largest Wholesale Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Fascinated by a mixed aroma of
incense and local flavors as well as a variety of elegant
handicrafts such as copper Buddha statues and butter lamps,
visitors to this capital of Tibet Autonomous Region are reluctant
to leave when lingering at the Bargor Fair Street, known as Tibet'
s largest wholesale market, at the foot of the incense-coiling
Johkang Temple.
</P>
<P>
Every day, thousands of tourists and buyers pour in the 3-5
meters wide street. A jewelry peddler said she has enjoyed a
flourishing business in the street for the past ten years as
tourism is booming.
</P>
<P>
Begun more than 1,000 years ago, the market has been shaped by
pilgrims flocking in from all over Tibet to worship the statue of
Sakyamuni, the founder of Buddhism, in the Johkang Temple erected
in the Seventh Century, which is a shrine for Tibetans.
</P>
<P>
However, with a population averaging two people per square
kilometer, transactions at Bargor were falling behind until the
democratic reform was introduced in 1959. There were only less
than 50 stalls in the street and some foreign travelers or
profiteers who used to cheat local people with such unfair barters
as a box of matches for a whole sheepskin, said Pinco, director of
the street's industry and commerce station.
</P>
<P>
Now with goods ranging from tourist souvenirs, religious tokens
and ornaments, cosmetics and books to daily necessities, electric
appliances and cars, the street is not only a tourist attraction
but also a place for local Tibetans to purchase their daily
necessities.
</P>
<P>
Besides locally-manufactured articles, there are goods
transported from other inland places and imports from neighboring
Nepal and India.
</P>
<P>
Burga, a Nepal businessman residing in Tibet, has noticed
intensified competition in the street. "Goods that I brought from
Nepal like electric appliances and cosmetics are not selling as
hot as the previous years, because of increasing numbers of
competitors from China's inland regions," he said.
</P>
<P>
The current daily transactions in the street can average 400,
000 yuan. As Pinco said, the street is a window reflecting the
changes of life in Tibet.

<HEADLINE> Pig Farming Declines in Zambia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Pig farming has declined and
forced Zambia Pork Products (ZAPP) to drastically reduce
slaughtering capacity from 250 to less than 100 pigs a day.
</P>
<P>
ZAPP chief executive Webster Musukwa said in an interview in
Lusaka Tuesday that his company had been adversely affected by the
shortage of pigs which has resulted in the animals fetching very
high prices.
</P>
<P>
Musukwa attributed the fall in the population of pigs to the
high cost of stock-feed which had made pig rearing an expensive
venture in the country, Times of Zambia newspaper reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"The pig population is very low and usually we end up with high
prices for pigs. We are only able to slaughter at the most 150
pigs because there are not enough pigs to slaughter," Musuka
complained.
</P>
<P>
He said ZAPP which was privatized in 1996 was determined to
regain its place as a major dealer in pork products and had
started an expansion program.
</P>
<P>
ZAPP was working on improving the packaging of its products to
beat the heavy competition from imported pork products that had
flooded the market. ZPAA only bought local pigs, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Mayor's Post Vacant After Imprisonment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The mayoral seat of Kampala,
Uganda's capital city, has fallen vacant following imprisonment of
Mayor Nasser Sebaggala in the United States, a senior official has
said.
</P>
<P>
Bidandi Ssali, the local government minister, was quoted by
Wednesday's New Vision daily as saying Tuesday that the Attorney
General had written to the Electoral Commission informing them the
seat is now vacant so that they can organize a by-election.
</P>
<P>
The local government minister, however, did not give details
about the Attorney General's communication to the commission, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
Officials both at the commission and Kampala City Council said
they did not know about the matter.
</P>
<P>
Alex Nkonge, the commission's legal officer, said under the
Local Government Act, it is the Clerk to Council who writes to the
commission whenever there is a vacancy in the council.
</P>
<P>
John SSebaana Kizito, former chairman of Sebaggala's campaign
team, said they would have to study the law before they could
decide on what to do if the post should be declared vacant.
</P>
<P>
Sebaggala, arrested in the United States in mid-June of 1998
for eight counts of bank fraud and lying to customs officers, was
convicted on December 4 and sentenced to 15 months' imrisonment
on Februa 24 of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's Constitution has not had a specific clause determining
the fate of a mayor sentenced abroad. It is up to the Attorney
General and Solicitor General to interpret the relevant laws.

KAMPALA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-two tourists from Norway
have arrived in Uganda to see the country's national beauty spots
in spite of the recent massacre of eight gorilla trackers and a
game official by the Rwandan Interahamwe rebels.
</P>
<P>
The group of tourists, comprising both men and women from the
Norwegian Forestry Society, arrived here Tuesday, the New Vision
daily reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Norwegian Ambassador to Uganda Arild Oyen was quoted as saying
that the group had not cancelled their trip as previously
reported.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the group, instead of going to the
national parks in western Uganda where the massacre took place on
March 1, would visit the Murchison Falls in Masindi district in
central Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The tour, planned a year ago, will also take them to other
natural forests in the country.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's tourism industry has been steadily growing despite
inadequate infrastructure, government officials fear the bad
publicity the country attracted after the death of the eight
foreign tourists may hurt the fledgling industry more.
</P>
<P>
Now most foreign tourists who had planned trips to Uganda have
made cancellations and therefore, tour operators and agencies
became quite idle.

NAIROBI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's Attorney-General Amos
Wako has called on all relevant institutions to take stern and
decisive actions on anti-corruption, all major newspapers based
here reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The time has come "to move from rhetoric to action to tame the
cancer that has invaded all institutions in the country," Wako
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The cancer of corruption has invaded institutions in the
administration of justice... We know that corruption exists in the
various registries, like companies registry or lands registry,"
Wako said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the launch of the Legal Sector Reform
Coordination Committee here, the Attorney General urged police
and key government institutions such as the Kenya Revenue
Authority to lay clear strategies on anti-graft if they have not
yet done so.
</P>
<P>
Wako admitted that the country's laws were in dire need of
reform to enhance the protection of human rights, efficient
justice and good governance.
</P>
<P>
He also urged lawyers and judicial officers to shun corrupt
dealings, saying the much-touted excuse that they are part of the
society which accepts corruption no longer holds water.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- Former Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who left the
Likud to lead the Center Party, said on Tuesday that he would
consider forming a coalition with the Likud after the elections.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for Dan Meridor, who is the No. 3 in the Center
Party, clarified later that under no circumstances would the party
join a coalition led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu. However, if Mordechai wins the elections, all parties
will be invited to join him.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- A State Comptroller's report has cleared Labor Party leader
Ehud Barak of charges that he failed to help soldiers wounded in a
training accident in October 1992. Barak, then chief of staff, was
on the scene when the accident, in which five soldiers were killed
and six others wounded, ocurred. In the years since, the issue has
become a political grindstone used by Barak's opponents,
particularly Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The allegations leveled against Labor Party leader Ehud
Barak that he abandoned injured soldiers in the 1992 training
accident were never credible. The State Comptroller's report,
released to a selected group of people Tuesday, exonerates him
from any wrongdoing.

<HEADLINE> World's Oldest Irrigation System Unearthed in Central China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Experts say the system can date back to 6,300 years ago and
they believe it is the most ancient irrigation work in the world.
</P>
<P>
The whole structure was consisted of pits and ditches and it
was probably used to save rainwater to irrigate the paddy field in
time of drought, according to He Jiejun, director of the
provincial archeological research center.
</P>
<P>
He said that members of a Chinese archeological team have
excavated three pits all in shape of cauldron and measured at 1.2
meters in diameter and 1.3 meters in depth. Each of the pits is
believed to link to three ditches.
</P>
<P>
Only three furrows have been partly unearthed so far and they
all lead to the direction of an ancient rice field, which was
listed among China's top ten archeological finds in 1997.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, a lot of primitive farming tools have been
unearthed in and near the 100-sq-m field.
</P>
<P>
Some Japanese archeologists are using start-of-the-art know-how
to analyze how frequent the local drought seasons could be several
thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
"Sample analysis suggests that some 200 people lived near the
irrigation system at that time," said He.
</P>
<P>
"Since the ditches are partially excavated, it is now hard to
say from where local primitives channeled water into the fidlds."
</P>
<P>
The find of the irrigation system further proves that the Lake
Dongting area is one of the world's oldest rice production base
and one of the most important rice granaries in China, He added.
</P>
<P>
China boasts the world's two lots of rice fields that date back
to the Neolithic Age (10,000-4,000 years ago). The other one
dating back to 6,100 years ago is in Wuxian County in east China's
Jiangsu Province.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Police Probe Americans' Arms Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean police have widened
investigations into the discovery of arms of war possessed by
three U.S. citizens at Harare International Airport Sunday, the
daily Herald reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Minister of State Security Sydney Sekeramayi said
Tuesday the issue was "very sensitive" and that investigations had
been widened to establish the exact motive behind the trio's
mission in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We are carrying out very thorough investigations, as we would
want to establish their motive. Once we are through with the
investigations, we will be able to issue a comprehensive
statement. Issues such as this one are very complicated by their
very nature," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not going to sit idle and see things happen just like
that. We have broadened our investigations to get to the bottom
of it all," he added.
</P>
<P>
The Herald newspaper quoted security sources as saying that the
seizure of the highly sophisticated weapons and the subsequent
arrest of the three men could have been part of a much broader
covert operation to destabilize Zimbabwe and the region as a
whole.
</P>
<P>
Local security agencies said Tuesday that the three suspected
saboteurs appear to have been part of a mercenary force operating
in the region, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
One of the force's major missions in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (DRC) was to topple President Laurent Kabila's government
and replace it with a puppet one, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Intelligence sources said if they had succeeded in their DRC
assignment, Zimbabwe was possibly next in line.
</P>
<P>
A team of investigators was sent to the DRC Tuesday to
establish the authenticity of the trio's story that their mission
had been to destabilize Congo and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that the heavily armed Americans have been
shuttling between Zimbabwe, Zambia and the war-torn DRC
reconnaissance missions since April last year.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the paper also reported that the three were
arrested after their luggage was found with the arms of war at the
Harare Airport. Minutes after their arrest, some people claiming
to be Americans called some high-ranking police officers, trying
to solicit for their release.
</P>
<P>
"What is baffling is how the callers knew of the arrest. The
suspects had not been allowed access to a telephone and the U.S.
Embassy had not been informed," said an investigating officer.
</P>
<P>
The three are aged 34, 35 and 37 and were still being held at
Harare Central Police Station. They gave warned and cautioned
statements to police and are expected to appear in court
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Investigations are continuing.

<HEADLINE> SOE Reform Goal in Concrete Terms Spelt Out (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- In spite of mounting external and
internal constraints on economic growth and various problems
triggered by its reform package, the Chinese government has vowed
not to slow its pace in reforming state-owned enterprises (SOE).
</P>
<P>
A leading official in charge of SOE reform pledged at the
ongoing session of the nation's legislature here that two thirds
of the country's money-losing state-owned large- and medium-sized
enterprises will become profitable within two years.
</P>
<P>
With about one-third of such firms expected to stop losing
money each year, the number of enterprises in the red will be
reduced to less than 15 percent of all state-owned big and medium-
sized enterprises by the turn of this century, according to Sheng
Huaren, minister in charge of the State Economic and Trade
Commission (SETC).
</P>
<P>
Economists hail this as "a much clearer goal" after the
government's 1997 plan of "helping most large- and medium-sized
SOEs get out of difficulties", which indicated the government's
determination to meet the target.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 7,680 large- and medium-sized SOEs and SOEs of
great significance in the country, those operating in the red
exceed 2,300, accounting for about 30 percent of the total,
according to the latest statistics from the SETC.
</P>
<P>
Years after SOE reform was initiated, which was intended to
help the sector shake off losses incurred under a planned economy
and play by market rules, the Chinese government already has in
mind a clear blueprint for the reform.
</P>
<P>
"The most important thing for us now is to continue unifying
our thinking and unswervingly carrying out principles and policies
that have been formulated," Premier Zhu Rongji stressed in a
government work report last Friday.

<HEADLINE> Improved Living Standard In SW China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The living standard of both urban
and rural people in southwest China's Sichuan Province has
improved steadily over the past 20 years thanks to local economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Per capita income of farmers was 1,790 yuan in 1998, a 109-yuan
increase from 1997, while urban income was 5,127 yuan, or 362 yuan
more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Per capita expenditures amounted to 4,383 yuan, an increase of
288 yuan from 1997, and urbanites' savings totalled 200.2 billion
yuan last year, a 33.92 billion yuan increase from the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
Per capita living space of urbanites increased from 8.3 sq.m.
in 1997 to 9.1 sq.m. last year.
</P>
<P>
The rapid industrial and agricultural development and an
increasing GDP over the past two decades are given as the main
reason for the improved standard of living. In 1998, Sichuan had a
GDP of 8.03 billion yuan, 9.3 percent more than for 1997, and one
percentage point higher than the national level.
</P>
<P>
Its agricultural output value was 144.84 billion yuan, up 4.3
percent, and grain output exceeded 36 million tons, a net increase
of 500,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The province's industrial value-added output was up 11 percent

<HEADLINE> SOE Reform Goal in Concrete Terms Spelt Out (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Reform is not all plain sailing, however. The most thorny
problems for the present include a glut of goods, a bloated staff
in SOE, and lack of competent managers with the know-how of
running a firm under market economic conditions, according to
Zheng Silin, vice-minister in charge of SETC.
</P>
<P>
To solve these problems, the government is moving to
restructure major industries and reduce industrial capacity:
backward spindles are destroyed, illegal small mines shut down,
coal output reduced, and petrol, petrochemical and metallurgical
industries restructured.
</P>
<P>
Also, enterprises are urged to downsize. The government has
also sponsored massive training programs for managers, who will be
warned if their firms could not eliminate loss in one year and
removed from their jobs if their firms continue to operate in the
red two years later.
</P>
<P>
Problems triggered by reform of SOE reform should not be
neglected. The laying off of workers has become a serious problem.
With SOE reform to deepen, a lot more workers will be laid off
this year, according to officials from SETC.
</P>
<P>
Other matching reforms are expected to lessen the pains. With
re-training and re-employment centers burgeoning all over the
country, a total of 6.09 million laid-off workers found new jobs
last year alone. The building of a social security system is well
underway.
</P>
<P>
Promising signs also showed up in some areas. Thanks to a full
implementation of central government policies, the leading
industrial center of Shanghai reduced the proportion of money-
losing state enterprises to 24 percent from 34 percent in 1994.
Sales turnover of the sector soared 80 percent from five years ago,
and problems such as the high debt-to-assets ratio, bloated staff,
and heavy welfare burdens have also been effectively dealt with.
</P>
<P>
The announcement of a time table for achieving the SOE reform
goal in concrete terms indicates that the government is confident
of attaining the goal within the prescribed time limit.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up River-Harnessing after Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The catastrophic summer flooding
of 1998 served as a dose of stimulant to China, increasing its
awareness of the importance of flood prevention and making flood
control a most-discussed and most-concerned topic at the ongoing
session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the nation'
s highest legislature.
</P>
<P>
Describing lessons from the flooding as "costly", governor of
Hubei province Jiang Zhuping said, "Although China was able to
overcome the flooding last year with water control facilities
built after the founding of New China, weakness was also exposed
in the facilities." Hubei is one of the most severely-affected
provinces during the 1998 flooding.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shenglian, a water control expert from Hubei said
embankments in China are not high enough to stand against severe
floods. "People will have to risk their lives to fight floods in
flood seasons. Still, spring and seepage are common in the dikes
which are made higher hurriedly in urgent situations, as happened
last summer along the Nengjiang and Songhua rivers in northeastern
China's Heilongjiang province." he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict severe flooding could hit China this year.
Xiong Jiazhen, a farmer NPC deputy and also a frequent victim of
Yangtze flooding, said the 1998 flooding has sounded an alarm and
urgent measures should be immediately taken.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Jiangxi, another affected province along the
Yangtze River, said, "The more efforts we put into dike building
in dry seasons, the less worries we will have in rainy seasons."
</P>
<P>
Cai Lifeng from Hunan province pointed out that increasing
occurrences of flooding in recent years have resulted from
population growth, environment pollution and soil erosion. "It is
necessary to make comprehensive improvements in a host of related
fields to have long-term, effective flood control," he said.
</P>
<P>
A water control expert to the NPC session said the family
planning policy should be strictly carried out along with river-
harnessing. "Over-population makes flood control more difficult
since it results in excessive land reclamation and excessive
logging, and hampers flood diversion," he said.
</P>
<P>
To the relief of the deputies, Premier Zhu Rongji pledged
greater efforts for flood prevention in his government work report
last Friday, for repairing water control projects, reinforcing
dikes along major rivers, and banning logging and land-reclamation
which destroy forest land and lakes.
</P>
<P>
China is moving to reinforce major dikes along big rivers in
two or three years till they can stand against the most severe
flooding since 1949. It injected a record 14.345 billion yuan (
about 1.732 billion US dollars) into such projects last year alone.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governments also learned a bitter lesson from the
1998 flooding, putting forward measures and pledging heavy
investment to shore up dikes and protect ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
To increase the rivers' floodwater storage capacity, the
central government has started a massive emigration project in
areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. A
total of 940,000 local residents will be relocated, almost the
same as the number to be relocated for the building of the Three
Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu province stood the test of last year's Yangtze flooding
with the flood-control projects it had built after a severe
flooding in 1991. Chen Huanyou, chairman of the Jiangsu Provincial
People's Congress Standing Commitee, said Jiangsu will take ten
years to build a complete system of water-control facilities.

<HEADLINE> China Encourages Public Offerings of High-Tech Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China will give priority to
initial public offerings of high-tech firms to foster the nation's
high-tech industry, according to China's securities regulatory
authority.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities Regulatory
Commission (CSRC), said that qualified high-tech firms will be
given access to public offerings regardless of their scale and
ownership.
</P>
<P>
He noted that initial public offerings of companies are subject
to scrutiny by the CSRC, and some 60 companies failed this
examination last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that 11 high-tech companies were listed last year,
raising funds totaling 3.9 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also said that securities companies are entitled to the
same money-raising rights as other financial institutions, and
added that securities firms are expected to be given access to the
inter-bank lending and borrowing market and the bond repurchasing
market.
</P>
<P>
According to China's first Securities Law promulgated last
December, securities firms will be classified into two groups.
Companies with registered capital above 500 million yuan may have
access to businesses ranging from underwriting of new stocks to
brokerage, while companies with registered capital between 50-500
million yuan will be confined to brokerage business.
</P>
<P>
Securities companies are also required to separate their own
accounts from those of their clients under the new rules, which
will take effect on July 1 this year.
</P>
<P>
The new rules will not reduce the capital flow into China's
stock market, commented Zhou. The fledgling stock market has a
large potential to tap, and securities firms under the new
regulation will enjoy a healthier growth, he explained.
</P>
<P>
Zhou also expressed confidence in the future of China's stock
market. An improvement in the economic situation at home and
abroad may help bring about better returns for manufacturers, and
the steady increase in personal savings can provide adequate funds
for the market, he said.

MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
taken measures to help local governments safeguard their computer
systems from effects of the year 2000 (Y2K) problem.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said Wednesday that the Development Bank

A portion of the fund will be used to prepare local governments

</P>
<P>
They added that the government has also appealed to the private
sector "to lend their expertise" to the local governments to
upgrade the skills of their information technology personnel in
girding for the millennium bug.
</P>
<P>
The local governments face a severe lack of technical personnel
capable of coming up with a comprehensive solution to the Y2K
problem, they said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has launched an all-out
campaign against reckless driving to curb road accidents, the
Daily Star reported on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Motorists, who jeopardized the lives of themselves and others,

<HEADLINE> NPC Session Holds Fourth Plenary Meeting (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The ongoing Second Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), China's top legislature,
held its fourth plenary meeting here this morning to hear reports
on the work of the Supreme People's Court and the Supreme People's
Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
Top Party and state leaders, including Jiang Zemin, Li Peng,
Zhu Rongji, Hu Jintao, Wei Jianxing and Li Lanqing were present at
the meeting, which was presided over by Cheng Siyuan, an executive
chairman of the session and an executive member of its Presidium.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Yang, president of the Supreme People's Court, first
delivered a report on the work of the court over the past year to
the legislators.
</P>
<P>
"The supreme court has focused on the central tasks of the
Party and the state, attached great importance to safeguarding
judicial justice, earnestly performed its duty defined by the
Constitution and laws, made intensified efforts to improve its
trial work in various aspects, and contributed to maintaining
social stability, safeguarding reform and promoting development,"
said the top Chinese judge.
</P>
<P>
Last year, he said, the Supreme People's Court handled 4,673
cases of second-instance, retrial and death penalty examination,
among which 4,535 were concluded.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, local courts across China in 1998 handled a
total of 5.41 million first-instance cases, 2.31 percent more than
in the previous year. Among these cases, more than 482,000, or 10.
36 percent of the total, were criminal cases, and the rest 4.929
million cases involved civil, economic, administrative and marine
disputes, accounting for 89.64 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The top judge said that last year Chinese courts concluded more
than 5.39 million cases, 2.77 percent more than in 1997 and
representing a case conclusion rate of 94.23 percent. The total
amount of money involved in all concluded cases exceeded 595.8
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Courts across China in 1998 also handled some 2.2 million cases
in which the involved parties had applied for the enforcement of
court verdicts. More than 2.07 million such cases involving a
total of over 158.3 billion yuan were concluded according to law,
said Xiao.

<TEXT>
<P>
However, the top judge also conceded that the general public
still have "quite a few dissatisfactions" with the court's work.
</P>
<P>
These dissatisfactions were mainly caused by a lack of
awareness to safeguard the overall interests of the Party and the
state among a few court officials and judges, poor handling of and
unfair judgment for some cases, a dilatory style of work of some
judges which has led to delayed conclusion of a few cases, a cold,
indifferent and crude attitude toward the litigants of some judges,
the practice of local protectionism in trials and verdict
enforcement by some courts out of considerations of their own
interests, as well as the persistent difficulty for the timely
enforcement of court verdicts, Xiao noted.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, some courts, especially those in the poor
regions, still suffer from a serious lack of case-handling funds,
poor work conditions and out-of-date equipment and facilities,
which have affected timely trials and verdict enforcement.
</P>
<P>
The top judge went on to say that the people's courts are faced
with extremely arduous tasks in 1999, a year of "particular
significance in the history of both the Party and the state".
</P>
<P>
What the Chinese courts will do this year includes implementing
the principle of "governing the country according to law",
promoting the strict enforcement of the law with a sense of
justice, efficiency and honesty, deepening court reforms so as to
promote the trial work and ensure judicial justice, and providing
a strong judicial guarantee for the maintenance of social
stability and the all-round advancement of the cause of reform,
opening-up and socialist modernization into the next century, he
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
In his report on the procuratorial work to the NPC session, Han
Zhubin, procurator-general of the Supreme People's Procuratorate,
said that the past year has witnessed procuratorial bodies across
the country earnestly fulfill their duties and achieve new
progress in their work.
</P>
<P>
"Last year procuratorial bodies across China investigated 35,
084 cases of power abuse, including embezzlement, bribery and
dereliction of duty, which involved a total of 40,162 persons,"
said the top Chinese prosecutor, adding that investigation had
been concluded in 34,081 cases involving 38,883 persons, with
legal proceedings taken against 26,834 persons involved in 22,700
such cases.
</P>
<P>
Through these investigations, the procuratorial bodies helped
retrieve direct economic losses worth 4.38 billion yuan for the
state, he added.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that in 1998, China's procuratorial bodies
issued warrants for arresting 582,120 of the 689,025 criminal
suspects transferred for examination by the public and state
security organs, and instituted legal proceedings against 557,929
of the 668,425 criminal suspects turned over for prosecution.
</P>
<P>
However, the procurator-general conceded that there remain
quite a few problems in the country's procuratorial organs and in
their work.
</P>
<P>
The development of the education and rectification efforts in
procuratorial bodies across the country has been uneven and the
overall quality of the country's current contingent of procurators
still falls short of the demands of the new situation and various
new tasks, he said, adding that there are also many weak points in
the functioning of the procuratorial organs.
</P>
<P>
"Moreover, procuratorial bodies at the higher levels haven't
done enough to effectively strengthen their guidance for the work
of procuratorial bodies at the lower levels, and disobedience to
orders and prohibitions of the higher authorities can still be
seen on some occasions," he added.
</P>
<P>
Calling 1999 a year of "critical importance" for the cross-
century development of China's procuratorial work, Han said that
this year procuratorial organs across the country will earnestly
perform their duty of judicial supervision, further improve the
quality of the procurators, actively promote internal reforms and
strive to create a fine environment based on the principle of the
rule of law for the country's reform, opening-up and economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2,737 NPC deputies participated in today's plenary
meeting. Members of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference, China's top advisory
body also in session here since last week, attended the meeting as
observers.

SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- After a few flicks here and
there, Andrew Henry turned all the table-tennis-ball sized
footballs and baseballs hanging from his neck into micro-
telescopes.
</P>
<P>
Henry is no magician. He is a British businessman participating
in the '99 East China Fair here, which opened on March 5.
</P>
<P>
"These little things are beautiful, interesting, creative and
inexpensive," Henry said of the Chinese products.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't expect to find so many good products while attending
a fair in Shanghai for the first time," Henry told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
Henry, chairman of Alan Salter Ltd., ordered 2,000 ball-shaped
telescopes without bargaining for a price, and told a dealer with
the Zhejiang Provincial Commercial Group that he will order
several containers of the product if it sells well.
</P>
<P>
Henry is among the 5,000 business people from more than 90
countries and regions participating in the fair, an annual event
that presents the latest and best products from Shanghai and six
East China provinces.
</P>
<P>
Initial statistics show that the turnover at the fair totaled
567 million U.S. dollars in the first five days, 10 percent more
than the comparable figure last year.
</P>
<P>
"It's inspiring that Chinese products are well received by
overseas traders and this indicates our export situation this year
is likely to be better than last year," said Xu Bingjin, assistant
minister of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation.

Walking between lines of exhibition booths, Xu said that the
Asian financial crisis has brought to China both tremendous export
difficulties and a good opportunity to accelerate foreign trade
reforms and achieve a shift from quantitative expansion to
continuous quality improvement.
</P>
<P>
At one booth, Shanghai Worldbest Kama Machinery Co. Ltd.,
which has issued B-shares for overseas investors, broadcast an
English-language program on more than 200 types of farming
machinery produced by its six controlling firms for export to
Africa, Southeast Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
A trader from Southeast Asia who declined to give his name
said he was interested in placing an order and planned to refit
the farming tools and re-export them to Europe.
</P>
<P>
"It's hard to imagine that a Chinese company produces such a
large number of different types of farm equipment for customers in
so many countries," said Du Gongpu, senior economist of the
Shanghai Municipal Economic and Trade Commission, who has been to
all seven previous fairs.
</P>
<P>
"Why are these products based on the latest technical
innovations so welcome?" he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese products overall are still not internationally
well-known, their quality and technical content are rising rapidly
and more and more products now rival the similar products from
developed nations, according to Hideyuki Hoshiya, chief
representative of Japan's Mitsui &AMP; Co. Ltd..
</P>
<P>
"You may not know that many foreign business people have made
fortunes by trading in Chinese products," Hoshiya told Xinhua.

<HEADLINE> China's Top Judge Briefs NPC Deputies On Court Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The people's courts across China
handled some 5.41 million cases and passed sentences to more than
530,000 criminals in 1998, representing rises of 2.31 percent and
30.76 percent, respectively, over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released by Xiao Yang, president of China's
Supreme People's Court, this morning when he reported the work of
his court to the National People's Congress, China's highest
lawmaking body, which has been in session here since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
Xiao said that the supreme court handled 4,673 cases last year
for second instance hearings, final appeals and death sentence
approvals, and concluded a total of 4,535 cases.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, local courts throughout the country also
concluded more than 5.39 million civil, economic, administrative
and marine cases involving over 595.8 billion yuan, Xiao said.
</P>
<P>
Last year, China continued its crackdown on crimes, the cases
of violence in particular. Cases of murder, robbery and drug
ranked the first, second and third places in the total capital
punishments approved by the Supreme People's Court last year, Xiao
said.
</P>
<P>
Crimes of graft, bribery and misappropriation of public funds
were also severely dealt with in accordance with law. Courts
across the country handled 18,468 cases of economic crimes and
handed down sentences to 15,670 offenders. Three officials at the
ministerial level including former Beijing mayor Chen Xitong, 54
people holding posts at the prefecture or department level
government and 434 people holding posts at the county or division
level received sentences for their misconduct, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the top judge, the people's courts have paid
special attention to solving financial-related cases, preventing
financial risks and safeguarding economic security, according to
the plan of the central government. Altogether 1,431 cases of
state compensation were handled and concluded last year.
</P>
<P>
The courts also made efforts to promote open trial in a bid to
guarantee judicial justice. Open trial was conducted in all first
instance cases, except those defined by law as not appropriate for
public hearing. And for some second instance cases, courts also
have adopted open trial but all verdicts or rulings of the second
instance cases were publicly announced. Trial of some major cases
of public concern were televised or broadcast live, said Xiao.
</P>
<P>
The role of the collegiate bench and the independent judge have
been strengthened and the reform on the system of people's jury
began to unveil in light of the principles in the Constitution and
relevant laws.
</P>
<P>
Xiao briefed NPC deputies on court work for 1999, saying that
this year is of special significance in China and the people's
court faces arduous tasks.
</P>
<P>
The top judge pledged continued efforts to maintain social
stability and ensure the smooth development of reform, opening up
and socialist modernization drive.

<HEADLINE> Dementia Threatens China's Senior Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Dementia threatens China's old
people almost as seriously as in industrialized countries,
according to research carried out in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
It showed that 4.61 percent of Shanghai citizens who are older
than 65 suffer from dementia, now known as Alzheimer's, while the
incidence climbed to 12.2 percent among the population older than
75, which "has approached the level in developed countries," said
a report in today's Wenhui Daily.
</P>
<P>
Researchers with the Shanghai Center of Mental Health
attributed the epidemic mainly to the rapid growth of the aging
population. Shanghai has 2.7 million people aged 60 and older.
</P>
<P>
They also discovered ties between dementia and genetic,
psychological and social factors.
</P>
<P>
People whose parents, brothers or sisters suffered dementia run
a four-fold risk of catching the disease than others, the report
quoted the researchers as saying, who have now set up a gene bank
in a bid to find dementia-related genes.
</P>
<P>
Poorly educated people, single senior citizens and those who
lack work or do no recreation are likely to be affected seven to
ten years earlier than others.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's quality certification for
foreign trade has gained international recognition, according to
an Entry-Exit Inspection and Quarantine Administration official.
</P>
<P>
A national certification committee for import-export trade
companies obtained international approval in 1998. By the end of
last year, according to the administration, 41 certification
institutions had been approved by the administration for quality
certification of imports and exports.
</P>
<P>
China began quality certification work in 1991, when the ISO

</P>
<P>
China plans to hold an exhibition of developments in this field
in early October.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Even though an increasing number
of Chinese urbanites dream of owning a car and a house of their
own, a recent survey has found that what they really want is a
healthy environment.
</P>
<P>
As many as 30 percent of those responding to a survey by the
State Forestry Administration and a Beijing company chose 'clean
air' as the most indispensable thing for an ideal living
environment, compared to 2.2 percent favoring an automobile, 1.4
percent, an apartment, 2.1 percent, more expressways, and 0.5
percent, a modern factory.
</P>
<P>
In answer to a question about "the relation between economic
development and environmental protection", 62.4 percent said that
priority should be given to long-term economic development, but
that it shouldn't damage the environment for future generations.
</P>
<P>
About 30 percent said that even if economic development is
affected, priority should be given to environmental protection,
because damage to the environment will eventually affect the
future.
</P>
<P>
Only 7.7 percent thought that the primary task is economic
development, with environmental protection subordinate.

<HEADLINE> China's Hotels Need Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Chinese hotels face an oversupply
and debt repayment pressures and need to be restructured, China
Business reports.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quotes Yang Yuanping, general manager of the five-
star Shanghai Jinjiang Tower, as saying that international
investors always try to recoup investment through operation
profits and an increase in the value of assets. But, Chinese
hotels tended to neglect increased assets value and get profit
from a shortage of supply.
</P>
<P>
So, when hotels become less profitable because of an oversupply,
an increase in asset value can no longer be neglected, he points
out. Many hotels have to spend the bulk of their profits on debt
repayment and this can seriously weaken their ability to improve
and become more competitive.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, real estate prices have been rising, and the
lack of liquidity has affected the ability to increase assets.
</P>
<P>
Yang is calling for immediate attention to the importance of
assets and suggests a restructuring of assets through acquisitions
and mergers to help hotels get out from heavy debt burdens.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's Reinstatement to MSCI Indices Possible: Bank Governor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 10 (Xinhua) -- There are signs that
Malaysia will be reinstated to the global benchmark of the Morgan
Stanley Capital International (MSCI) Indices, Bank Negara Malaysia
Governor Ali Abul Hassan bin Sulaiman said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia was dropped from the MSCI Indices after it imposed
selective exchange controls last September.
</P>
<P>
Though they have not indicated the intention for the
reinstatement but the signs are there, Ali told reporters after
addressing the 21st joint conference of Malaysian-Japan Economic
Associations here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Ali made the remarks when referring to Malaysia's re-inclusion
to the International Finance Corporation's (IFC) indices.
</P>
<P>
The IFC announced on March 8 that Malaysia would be added back
to its IFC Investable Composite Index and IFC Investable Asia
Index as a result of "gradual repeal of capital controls."
</P>
<P>
The governor said that for foreign funds, the recent
introduction of a graduated levy on foreign portfolio investments
meant the "re-opening" of the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange to them.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia had been in discussions with these fund
managers and they supported the levy system.

<HEADLINE> China's Anti-Corruption Drive Intensified, Han (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Procurator-General Han Zhubin
said here today that procuratorates in China have intensified an
anti-corruption campaign and stepped up efforts to deal with major
cases.
</P>
<P>
 In 1998, procuratorial bodies dealt with graft, bribery and
malfeasance cases involving a large number of government officials,
including three officials at the provincial-level, 103 at the
prefecture-level and 1,714 at the county-level. Meanwhile, another
1,773 graft, embezzlement and malfeasance cases each valued at 500,
000 yuan and more have also been handled.
</P>
<P>
 Han announced the results in a report on the work of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate he delivered today at the ongoing
Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
 Last year procuratorial departments handled a total of 35,084
graft, bribery and malfeasance cases involving 40,162 people, and
brought formal charges on 22,700 cases involving 26,834 people.
Their work recovered 4.38 billion yuan in lost public money, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Crimes committed by government workers involved the draining
of state-owned assets, the abuse of power for personal gains,
dereliction of duty in major engineering projects, and
infringement on citizens' rights and interests, according to Han.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates exercised the functions of approving arrests
and bringing charges according to law, cracking down on criminal
activities, he said.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, procuratorial bodies approved the arrest of 582,120
suspects out of close to 690,000, whose arrest was requested by
public and state security departments. They filed formal charges
against 557,929 suspects, out of 668,425, whose cases they handled.
</P>
<P>
In playing their supervisory role on litigious activities,
last year procuratorates focused on tackling the problems of
failure to file criminal cases, failure to bring charges against
suspects of criminal offences, and substitution of criminal
punishment by fines, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Liuba County in northwest China's
Shaanxi Province has discovered its first giant panda.
</P>
<P>
The 75-kg panda had been treed by three dogs for an entire
night last week before it fell to the ground in the morning and
was injured. Wei Chaozhong, a farmer, saved the animal's life and
immediately reported this to the local wildlife management center,
which sent the panda to the Shaanxi Rare Animal Rescue Center for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
A veterinarian described it as an 8-year-old female suffering
from intestinal bleeding.
</P>
<P>
Liuba County is in a damp subtropical part of the southern
Qinling Mountains that is considered ideal for the giant panda,
but people here say they've never seen pandas in these parts
before, even though they've seen evidence of them.
</P>
<P>
There are about 1,000 giant pandas living in the wild in
southern and northwestern parts of China. They are considered one
of world's most endangered species.

Procuratorates made decisions against the arrest of 93,218
people and the prosecution of 11,225 people; they also decided to
pursue for the arrest of 6,957 people and the prosecution of 3,094
people, he said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, Han said, procurators challenged 3,791 criminal
judgments which they believed to be incorrect, and raised views on
1,211 cases for the correction of irregularities in the judicial
process and on 9,672 cases for the correction of irregularities by
relevant departments involving matters including commutation,
parole, temporary serving a sentence outside prison under
surveillance and release on bail for medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
Procuratorates also examined 26,158 appeals on civil, economic,
administrative judgments and rulings, and challenged court
verdicts for 8,438 cases, Han noted.
</P>
<P>
Last year's procuratorial work was featured by: working
according to the work plan of the central authorities, improving
the quality of procuratorial work, attaching greater importance to
protecting citizens' rights, making greater efforts to prevent
official job-related crimes, and trying hard to improve the
professional competence of procurators.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, procuratorates will further carry out the anti-
corruption campaign, carry out their procuratorial
responsibilities in an all-round way, push ahead with reform of
procuratorial work, step up professional training for procurators,
fight corruption in procuratorial departments, and make new
contributions to safeguarding social and political stability and
improving procuratorial work comprehensively, according to the
procurator-general.

<HEADLINE> Telephone Rentals Up, Call Charges Down in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Basic telephone rentals will be
increased but charges for domestic and international long distance
calls will be drastically reduced in India.
</P>
<P>
The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) announced here
Tuesday that basic telephone rentals in urban areas will go up by
30 percent, or from 190 rupees (according to current official
rate, one U.S. dollar is roughly for 42.3 rupees) to 250 rupees
per month.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, cellular monthly rentals will be increased
from the current 156 rupees to 600 rupees, a hike of 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
TRAI also announced that domestic long distance charges will be
reduced by 45 percent while international call charges will be cut
by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
The hike in basic telephone rentals and reduction in domestic
long distance and international call charges will be implemented
over a three-year period beginning April 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
TRAI has also rationalized the airtime charges by fixing a
ceiling rate of 6 rupees per minute during standard hours (11
hours) and a concessional rate to be fixed by the service provider
for the balance 13 hours of the day effective from April.
</P>
<P>
The present structure has three rates of 16, 8 and 4 rupees for
peak, standard and off-peak hours.
</P>
<P>
In another major change, incoming calls on cellular phones will
be free of charge from August 1, 1999, with the caller bearing the
entire charge for a call both from a cellular phone as well as a
fixed phone.
</P>
<P>
Internet leased circuits charges, tariffs for all other
value-added services including electronic mail, voice mail, video
conference and closed users have also been adjusted.
</P>
<P>
TRAI said that the adjustment is aimed at rationalizing the
tariff regime by streamlining the different user groups by taking
into account usage pattern, size of the exchange and the
teledensity.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's table tennis world
champion Liu Guoliang and Asian Games champion swimmer Shan Ying
were among the top ten athletes named here on Wednesday by the
People's Liberation Army (PLA).
</P>
<P>
Liu contributed to China's victories last year in the men's
team and doubles events at both Asian table tennis championships
and Asian Games. He is now the world's top-ranked singles player.
</P>
<P>
Shan Ying from PLA's Guangzhou Units won three gold medals at
the Asian Games last December in Bangkok.
</P>
<P>
But the most consistent athlete among the ten elite PLA
athletes named on Wednesday was Wang Lianying, whose three gold
medals helped her to a fifth consecutive individual all-around
title at the 46th International Military Sports Council's
pentathlon championships. She was named into PLA's top ten
athletes for a fifth straight time.
</P>
<P>
Women took seven spots out of the ten selected from 20
candidates. And 13 of the candidates were women.
</P>
<P>
Among others honored on Wednesday were Wang Zhizhi, China's top
men's basketball player, Asian Games champion woman shooter Shan
Hong, Asian Games gold medal-winning woman weightlifter Wang
Xianbo and Wu Yongmei, member of the country's famed women's
volleyball team.

<HEADLINE> Kafelnikov, Rafter Lose Chance to Topple Sampras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A day before world number one
Pete Sampras was scheduled for his first match at the Newsweek
Champions Cup in Indian Wells, two of the four contenders who had
a chance to replace him lost their opening matches Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Second seed Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia was upset by former
French Open winner Gustavo Kuerten of Brazil 0-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3
and fifth seed Patrick Rafter of Australia was beaten 7-6 (7-2), 3-
6, 7-5 by German upstart Nicolas Kiefer in second-round matches.
</P>
<P>
Kafelnikov, who was only 70 points behind Sampras in the
rankings, blew a 3-1 third-set lead against Kuerten, completely
melting down in the last few games.
</P>
<P>
"I can't explain what happened," said Kafelnikov, the 1999
Australian Open champion. "I lost focus for a little while and
then boom, it was over. I was trying as hard as I could because
there are not many times you have the opportunity to win a
tournament and become number one."
</P>
<P>
Only third seed Alex Corretja and fourth seed Carlos Moya who
haven't played here yet have a shot to replace Sampras at number
one this week.
</P>
<P>
The up-and-comers, including Americans Justin Gimelstob and
Jan-Michael Gambill, as well as Aussie Lleyton Hewitt, who beat 33-
year-old fellow Mark Woodforde 4-6, 6-2, 6-4 reached third round.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Opens New Course to Upgrade Workers in Computer Storage Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Singapore launched Wednesday a
new course, the Certificate of Competence in (Computer) Storage
Technology, to upgrade its workforce with a view to enhance its
competitiveness in the hard disk industry.
</P>
<P>
Jointly offered by Singapore Polytechnic and the International
Disk Drive Equipment &AMP; Materials Association (IDEMA), the course
imparts broad-based, structured and fundamental knowledge required
by the disk drive industry, Minister without Portfolio and
Secretary General of the National Trades Union Congress Lim Boon
Heng said in his opening address.
</P>
<P>
"Our workers must keep up with the continuous upgrading of
technology. They must remain relevant and it is training that
makes the difference. Skills upgrading will ensure that all
employees will be fully able to take advantage of the constant
stream of new technologies and new customer requirements in
today's markets," Lim said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to a total of 130 classes to be held this year to
train 3,250 students in all, Lim said, "IDEMA is confident that up
to 1,500 training places will be taken up and workers will benefit
from this training course in the very first year."
</P>
<P>
The program is under the Skills Redevelopment Program (SRP), a
220-million-Singapore-dollar (128 million U.S. dollars) effort to
upgrade skills and enhance employability of the country's
workforce. Since its inception in December 1996, 175 companies
have been involved in reskilling about 9,400 workers.
</P>
<P>
Leading disk drive makers, Seagate and Western Digital, and
suppliers, 3M and Lighthouse Worldwide Solutions, have endorsed
the course. IDEMA'S industry partners have contributed internal
training materials, disk drive prototypes and even equipment to
the program.
</P>
<P>
Although the output of Singapore's data storage industry
declined in 1998 by about two percent to 19.5 billion Singapore
dollars (11.34 billion U.S. dollars) and total headcount dropped
by 16 percent to about 31,700, the data storage industry continues
to be the major contributor of Singapore's key electronics
industry's output, accounting for 32 percent last year, said Lim.

<HEADLINE> Terrorist Bomb Attack Kills One, Injures 11 in Sri Lanka </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- A suspected terrorist bomb ripped
through a bus in the Sri Lankan capital, killing a passenger and
wounding at least 11 others, police and hospital sources said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Police earlier said four of the wounded were in serious
condition, and the Colombo National Hospital sources confirmed
later that one of them had died overnight.
</P>
<P>
The bomb exploded in the bus at the Central Bus Station at
Pettah around 11:30 p.m. Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Police said the bomb had been placed under a seat in the bus
with 22 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
The blast was the second of the three to hit the city, the
first of which was on a train at a railway yard in Maradana. No
one was wounded but a train compartment was badly damaged. The
third explosion damaged a transformer near the bus terminal,
police said.
</P>
<P>
Police are conducting investigations. They suspect that the
Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) had sent bomb squads to
disrupt civilian life.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE has been fighting for an independent state for
minority Tamils in the north and east of the country since 1983.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Productivity Up 4.6 Percent in Fourth Quarter of 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Labor Department said
on Tuesday that the productivity of U.S. workers rose by 4.6
percent on an annual basis during the fourth quarter of last year,
the strongest in six years.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally-adjusted increase in output per hour of work at
non-farm businesses was the best gain since the final quarter of
1992. The preliminary estimate of the productivity for February
was 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Thus, productivity for the entire 1998 rose by a healthy 2.2
percent, a significant improvement on the 1.2-percent gain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Productivity, after growing at nearly a three-percent rate in
the 1960s and early 1970s, slowed to an anemic one-percent rate
from 1974 through 1995. Since then, it's been growing at nearly
two percent, leading some economists to speculate that the economy
has embarked on a new era of productivity growth, spurred by
computers and other high-tech innovations.
</P>
<P>
Since economists consider healthy productivity gains as the key
to prosperity and rising living standards, sizable gains mean
companies can pay employees more, hold the line on prices and
still deliver increased profits to shareholders.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, for instance, inflation-adjusted hourly wages and
benefits jumped by 2.6 percent, the largest gain in 12 years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, growth in unit labor costs, a key barometer of
underlying inflation pressures, slowed. They rose by 1.9 percent
in 1998, compared with 2.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Analysts believe last year's robust productivity growth bodes
well for the economy's ability to extend the longest peacetime
expansion in U.S. history while keeping inflation under control.
</P>
<P>
Although many factories suffered from shrinking export to Asia
and other parts of the world due to the global financial turmoil,
their productivity still increased by a strong 4.2 percent in 1998,
down from a five-year high of 4.9 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Productivity for businesses manufacturing durable goods --
items from cars to computers, surged by 6.8 percent, the biggest
advance since 1971.
</P>
<P>
The ability of manufacturers to maintain, and in many cases
improve, productivity reflects their determination to operate
efficiently in the face of slipping sales abroad. That, in turn,
has led to the loss of more than 300,000 jobs in the sector since
last March.

<HEADLINE> Ad Industry in Thailand Severely Hit by Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The advertisement industry in
Thailand has been hard hit by the economic crisis, with at least
500 people losing their jobs last year, the Advertisement
Association of Thailand (AAT) said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Due to the crisis and lower budget of customers, some 60 Thai
advertising agencies, or 20 percent of the total, were shut down
last year, leading to the layoffs, the AAT said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the industry employs about 10,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The AAT, which has more than 100 member firms, revealed that
the industry last year experienced an eight percent drop in media
spending to 38 billion baht (1.05 billion U.S. dollars) from 41.6
billion baht (1.15 billion dollars) a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
The association estimated that ad spending this year may
optimistically reach the same level as 1998, if not deteriorate
further.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that ad spending in January and February this
year continued to drop by 10 to 15 percent compared with the same
months last year.
</P>
<P>
Print media -- newspapers and magazines -- showed the highest
decline in ad spending last year by 34 and 30 percent
respectively.
</P>
<P>
TV commercials still accounted for a major share of total media
spending last year, but the proportion has dropped from 70 to 80
percent three years ago to only 60 percent today, being replaced
by cheaper media such as radio spots.
</P>
<P>
However, Thailand still maintained its great potential as a hub
for advertising creativity as well as production and
post-production activities at a world-class level, AAT said.
</P>
<P>
The association said many ad agencies have used Thailand as
their production base in order to take advantage of the cheaper
costs here.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Pentagon Officials Warn of "Electronic Pearl Harbor" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Deputy Defense Secretary
John Hamre on Tuesday warned Congress of an "electronic Pearl
Harbor" by cyber-terrorists and said the target is more likely to
be commercial than military.
</P>
<P>
Even though its computer network is penetrated by computer
hackers as often as 10 to 15 times a day, the Defense Department
thinks it has done a good job of protecting vital national
security interests, Hamre said.
</P>
<P>
Hamre told the Senate Armed Services Committee that all the
computer intrusions so far have been against non-sensitive
portions of the Pentagon computer system.
</P>
<P>
"To our knowledge, we have never been penetrated on our
classified networks," Hamre said. "We can protect the Department
of Defense, and I think we've done a great deal."
</P>
<P>
But he said he was increasingly worried about the vulnerability
of commercial and financial interests.
</P>
<P>
"And this Pearl Harbor's going to be different," Hamre said. "
It's not going to be against Navy ships sitting in a Navy shipyard.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Complete Road Development Plans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka aims to complete all
district level road development plans except in the north and east
by August in a bid to implement the National Road Development
Master Plan (NRDMP) by year 2000, the official Daily News reported
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Transport and Highways Ministry is expected to implement
the plan in collaboration with provincial councils and the local
authorities, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The NRDMP will encompass all districts and provincial road
development plans and also the roads which come under the purview
of local authorities, said the report.
</P>
<P>
By 1997, Sri Lanka had a road network of 11,147 kilometers.
Road congestion and shortage have adversely affect the country's
development and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Three committees, comprising district secretaries, divisional
secretaries and local authorities of each district, will maintain
and upgrade roads.
</P>
<P>
They will also keep contact with the Urban Development
Authority to avert clashes between road development plans and
urban development plans, the report said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the NRDMP will exclude the north and east of the
country where there is an ongoing war between government troops
and rebels of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam who have been
fighting for a separate Tamil state.

<HEADLINE> NASA Satellite's Star Research Mission Fails </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- U.S. NASA's star research
mission has come to an end after the failure of the satellite
telescope, the Associated Press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The satellite telescope, called Wide-field Infrared Explorer,
was launched on March 4 with the intention of studying the history
of galaxies and stars.
</P>
<P>
However, shortly after the satellite entered its second orbit,
the ground stations detected it spinning rather than maintaining a
stable orientation, and that the container for the hydrogen was
warmer than expected.
</P>
<P>
The hydrogen on the telescope was supposed to last four months
and used to keep the telescope below minus-430 degrees so the
instrument's own heat would not obscure infrared light from space.
</P>
<P>
But a cover over the telescope came off prematurely and allowed
sunlight to fall on the instrument, melting the hydrogen, which in
turn caused the spin.
</P>
<P>
NASA officials said that they could not save the mission, but
would continue their efforts to bring its satellite under control
and determine what went wrong.

<HEADLINE> Study: Fish Oil Reduces Death Rate Among Heart Attack Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A study released Tuesday shows
that people who start taking fish oil supplements after a heart
attack may be able to reduce their risk of dying from heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
The study of more than 11,000 heart attack victims found that
fish oil could reduce the risk by 15 percent if they all took fish
oil, said Dr. Gianni Tognoni at a meeting of the American College
of Cardiology in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
Tognoni and colleagues across Italy divided their 11,500
volunteers into four groups. One control group got dummy pills,
another got one gram of fish oil a day, a third group got vitamin
E and a fourth group got fish oil and vitamin E.
</P>
<P>
The two fish oil groups saw their risk of dying of heart
disease over three and half years reduced by 15 percent, the
researchers reported to the meeting Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Tognoni said it was not fully understood how fish oil worked.
It contains omega-three fatty acids, which are essential for cell
function.
</P>
<P>
He said there was some evidence that fish oil worked on the
inside lining of blood vessels, which become clogged with fatty
plaques causing heart disease.

<HEADLINE> Personal Computer: Demand Seen Healthy While Prices Weakening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A leading U.S. research firm
said Tuesday it expects healthy demand and weakening prices for
personal computers in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
International Data Corp., a division of privately-held media,
research and conference firm, expects the number of PCs shipped
worldwide in the first quarter to grow 14.1 percent over the same
period of 1998, because the Asia-Pacific market, excluding Japan,
continues to rebound.
</P>
<P>
It also expects 103.2 million PCs to be shipped from factories
in 1999, up 14.3 percent from 1998.
</P>
<P>
As for the outlook for growth in the U.S. dollar value of PC
shipment, the research firm sees just a 4.8-percent rise in 1999,
to 178.4 billion U.S. dollars because PC prices are expected to
continue to weaken during the year.
</P>
<P>
The first quarter growth worldwide is being led by strong
consumer markets in the United States, western Europe, the Asia-
Pacific region and Japan. In the United States, consumer interest
in inexpensive PCs has extended beyond the holiday shopping season
as low-cost vendors look to sell sizable numbers of machines.
</P>
<P>
The research firm expects the U.S. market to account for around
40 percent of first quarter PC shipments. Western Europe should
take around 26 percent of shipments while the Asia-Pacific region
will have 11 percent and Japan about 9 percent.

<HEADLINE> China Working on New Methods to Tackle Urban Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 10 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Labor is
working on a feasibility study to launch small personal loans to
help urban laid-off people start new businesses in an attempt to
cut the jobless figures.
</P>
<P>
An international symposium sponsored by the Ministry of Labor
and Social Security was recently held on the subject in this
capital of south China's Guangdong Province, which invited
financial advisors from the Asia Development Bank and experts from
Hong Kong, Taiwan, Germany and Peru to give their views.
</P>
<P>
Such personal loans have been used quite often in other parts
of the world to help finance impoverished regions. However, rarely
in China has this sort of measure been used to solve the
unemployment problem although small scale experiments have been
carried out in Shanghai, Tianjin and Kunming.
</P>
<P>
Financial experts at the meeting declared that such methods
have good prospects in China and reached a consensus that
Guangzhou City could be a suitable place to pilot the practice
because of its comparatively mature financial service system and
better public awareness of self-employment.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Of the registered jobless population of 150,000 of
the city, some 88,000 people found jobs, bringing down the city's
unemployed rate to 2.2 percent, lower than the country's average.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to tackle the issue, the city has used over 60 million
yuan to organize training courses for laid-off people and launched
low-interest loans as an encouragement to companies and
institutions to assimilate those unemployed workers. But, the
final hope of solving unemployment overall is believed to lie in
creating more jobs, and by making more use of the growing private
sector.
</P>
<P>
There are over 200,000 private businesses in Guangzhou
employing 350,000 people with registered total capital of three
billion yuan last year, up 12 percent on an annual basis.
</P>
<P>
These private businesses reported total retail sales of 21.9
billion yuan in 1998, which for the first time surpassed that of
the collectively-owned firms. The government is helping the sector
to find ways to avoid clashes with bigger firms, and is expected
to incorporate some of them into specific groups to explore the
private sector potential.

<HEADLINE> Kosovo Fighting Rages as Peace Efforts Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- As peace efforts are going on,
fresh fighting has erupted in Kosovo, where Yugoslav forces
battled ethnic Albanian rebels in the Kacanik region on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The fighting was in retaliation to attacks launched on Monday
and Tuesday by ethnic Albanian rebels with automatic rifles,
antitank grenades and mortars, according to the Pristina
Information Center.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia's official news agency Tanjug reported that ethnic
Albanian rebels on Monday killed two policemen and wounded three
others on patrol duty in Djakovica region.
</P>
<P>
Scattered violence in this and other parts of the war-torn
Serbian province has continued while both sides in the conflict
are deliberating on a standing peace offer, a plan that would give
Kosovo broad autonomy. Ethnic Albanians form an overwhelming
majority of the province and demand independence.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Yugoslav Deputy Prime Minister Zoran Lilic on
Tuesday indicated that Yugoslavia is opposed to the stationing of
NATO peacekeeping forces in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Military intervention would only lead to large-scale fighting
and instability in southeast Europe, Lilic warned.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 people have been killed and hundreds of
thousands displaced in a year of fighting between Yugoslav troops
and ethnic Albanian rebels in Kosovo, a province in Yugoslavia's
Republic of Serbia.

BANGKOK, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved a
1.9-billion-U.S. dollar stimulus package financed by foreign funds
to help spur the economy and alleviate the social impact of the
Asian crisis, a government house news release available here
Wednesday said.
</P>
<P>
The news release said the funds will come from the so-called
Miyazawa Initiative, launched by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi
Miyazawa last year and offering more than 30 billion dollars in
aid to crisis-hit Asian economies, and also from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
The first 850-million-dollar tranche of the package would be
channeled through five ministries -- Interior, Agriculture,
Industry, Education and Defense.
</P>
<P>
Earlier on Monday, Finance Minister Tarrin Nimmanhaeminda said
the funds will be used to jump-start domestic demand, create jobs
and increase the public's purchasing power.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai said that the money would have to
be spent this year with nothing left over for the next fiscal
year.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the funds had been set aside to create an
auditing team to ensure the money was properly and promptly
disbursed.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has received billions of dollars in foreign loans from
various sources, including 17.2 billion dollars from the
International Monetary Fund's rescue package, since its economy
collapsed in 1997, triggering the regional financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> China Pledges to Enhance Sino-Ukrainian Economic Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China is ready to further develop its
ties with Ukraine, especially in trade and economic sectors,
visiting Chinese state councilor Wu Yi said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Ukrainian and Chinese business people here, Wu, who
arrived Monday for a four-day visit, said that Ukraine is one of
China's important trading partners among the Commonwealth of
Independent States.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that both countries are exploring ways to expand
cooperation in the sectors of metallurgy, spaceflight materials,
electronics, telecommunications and textile.
</P>
<P>
These efforts are bound to give a new impetus to the
development of the economic and trade cooperation between the two
countries, she said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese official noted that the current Sino-
Ukrainian cooperation is still at a low level and has a great
potential to be tapped.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed the hope that Chinese and Ukrainian business
people will seek new areas to increase bilateral trade, develop
various forms of trade and economic cooperation, and standardize
and internationalize their practices in future cooperation.
</P>
<P>
She encouraged Ukrainian business people to invest in China.
</P>
<P>
Wu arrived here after a visit to Belarus.

<P>
BUCHAREST, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Serious landslides are causing
havoc in eastern and central Romania, where they have destroyed
houses and cut off nine roads.
</P>
<P>
In a village in the northeast county of Iasi, a landslide
shattered many houses and severed power and road connections.
</P>
<P>
A landslide in the northern county of Bistrita-Nasaud continued
to threaten some 30 households after razing a newly-built three-
story priory there.
</P>
<P>
A landslide in a resort in Ramnicu-Valcea county stranded
around 600 tourists for three days. Although the tourists were
later rescued, road links have not been restored yet.
</P>
<P>
Experts said the landslides were caused by flooding after heavy
rain. Since late February, thawed snow, coupled with excessive
rainfall, have led to floods that ravaged 11 counties.
</P>
<P>
Meteorological sources predicted that more areas will be hit by
floods as the rain continues.

<P>
BUCHAREST, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Moldovan President Petru
Lucinschi on Tuesday nominated caretaker Prime Minister Ion Sturza
for the second time as candidate for the premiership and called on
the parliament to approve him.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the parliament rejected his first nomination by 101
to 51 votes.
</P>
<P>
The Moldovan president asked the parliament to make compromise
to pave the way for the forming of the government, Moldovan state
television reported.
</P>
<P>
He threatened to dismiss the parliament and hold early
elections if the new government is vetoed again, the television
reported.
</P>
<P>
Under the country's constitution, a nominee for premier needs
15 days to form his cabinet.
</P>
<P>
But this time the president insisted that Sturza should present
the cabinet list together with his administrative programs to the
parliament for approval in only two days.
</P>
<P>
A former businessman, Sturza is an advocate of closer ties with
Europe and international financial institutions and wants to speed
up economic liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Former premier Ion Ciubuc resigned last month amid differences
with his ministers on the pace and degree of economic reforms.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar, Thailand Vow to Jointly Fight Narcotics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar and Thai governments have
vowed to further enhance their cooperation in the fight against
narcotic drugs, aimed at turning the common border of the two
countries into a border of friendship, harmony and prosperity.
</P>
<P>
A joint statement issued Tuesday night at the end of the
two-day visit to Thailand of Senior-General Than Shwe, chairman
of the Myanmar State Peace and Development Council and prime
minister, said the two prime ministers reaffirmed the commitment
of their two governments, as expressed in the last joint
communique in Yangon on May 17, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Than Shwe visited Thailand Monday and Tuesday at the invitation
of Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai.
</P>
<P>
The two prime ministers noted with satisfaction the existing
excellent cooperation during the past two years between the law
enforcement authorities of the two countries to coordinate and
expand their cooperative anti-narcotic efforts.
</P>
<P>
They welcomed the significant progress achieved so far by their
respective countries: the arrest of amphetamine producers and
traffickers, along with the destruction of more than 20 million
such tablets by Thailand in 1997-98; the seizure of more than
28,000 kilos of opium and over 4,000 kilos of heroin as well as
over 26 million amphetamine tablets by Myanmar in 1988-98, the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
They stressed the need for regional and international
cooperation in the fight against narcotic drugs and in this regard
noted with satisfaction the positive contribution of the 4th
International Heroin Conference held in Yangon last month, the
statement added.
</P>
<P>
They agreed to intensify the cooperation and the coordination
of law enforcement efforts with the aim of achieving the total
eradication of illicit drug production, processing, trafficking
and use in ASEAN by the year 2020 in accordance with the Joint
Declaration for a Drug-Free ASEAN as announced in Manila on July
25, 1998, the statement said.

<HEADLINE> Uzbek President Emphasizes Voluntariness of CIS Security Pact </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Uzbek President Islam Karimov
said Tuesday that renewal of the collective security treaty of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) is absolutely voluntary,
Interfax news agency reported from the Uzbek capital of Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Referring to his country's pullout from the CIS treaty on
February 5, Karimov said the move had nothing to do with the
country's joining the CIS and or with developing military
cooperation with Russia.
</P>
<P>
He blamed some Russian mass media for accusing Uzbekistan of "
showing an unhealthy interest" when it announced quit from the CIS
security pact.
</P>
<P>
The president said his country is willing to develop political
and military ties with Russia. However, Russia should regard
Uzbekistan as an equal partner, he added.
</P>
<P>
The only way to consolidate the CIS is to develop economic
integration, the president noted.
</P>
<P>
Only after economic integration is in progress, can higher
level integration be possible, Karimov said.
</P>
<P>
The 12-member CIS was set up after the breakup of the Soviet
Union in 1991 to coordinate security and economic policy among
former Soviet republics.
</P>
<P>
The bloc has come under increasing strain this year, with some
members saying they may quit its collective security agreement,
which was signed in Tashkent in May 1992 and will expire in May
this year.

<HEADLINE> Canada Says No to France's Invitation to Ministerial Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government announced
Tuesday that it has decided not to accept the invitation of the
French government to attend a ministerial meeting on development
and culture, scheduled for March 10 in Paris on the margins of the
annual meeting of the Inter-American Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Canada has taken this decision with regret due to the fact that
France, without consultation, issued a direct invitation to the
Government of Quebec to attend such a meeting of ministers of
sovereign states, said a release issued here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Only the Government of Canada has the right to decide on the
presence and representation of Canada and its constituent parts in
relations with other sovereign states, said the release.
</P>
<P>
It also said the decision does not put in question the rules
governing La Francophonie -- the French-speaking region in the
world, or the direct and privileged relations that have been
established over the years between France and Quebec with the
agreement of the government of Canada.
</P>
<P>
However, this practice cannot be extended to any other
international context without the express consent of the
Government of Canada.
</P>
<P>
It would be regrettable if the balance in the relationship
among Paris, Ottawa and Quebec should be jeopardized by a lack of
consultation, said the release.

<HEADLINE> German FM Urges Ethnic Albanians, Serbs to Sign Peace Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Visiting German Foreign Minister
Joschka Fischer and his Albanian counterpart Paskal Milo on
Tuesday called on both Serbs and ethnic Albanians in the Serbian
province of Kosovo to sign the Rambouillet peace agreement as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
"I appeal to both sides to sign the peace agreement. It is the
only way to peace. The other alternative is war and we cannot
accept it," Fischer told a press conference held jointly with Milo
at the end of his brief visit to Albania.
</P>
<P>
He made a special appeal to ethnic Albanian leaders to sign the
agreement, saying failure to do so would be "a historic mistake"
for them.
</P>
<P>
"If possible, they should put their signature on the agreement
even before March 16," he added, noting that this would open the
way for the West to increase pressure on Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
The international community would exert no pressure on Yugoslav
President Slobodan Milosevic unless the ethnic Albanians signed
the agreement, he argued.
</P>
<P>
Echoing Fischer's appeal, Milo said: "In the name of the
Albanian government, I call on Kosovo Albanian leaders, and
particularly, on leaders of the KLA (Kosovo Liberation Army) to
sign the draft agreement as soon as possible, even today or
tomorrow."
</P>
<P>
Milo reiterated that Albania stood for a peaceful settlement of
the Kosovo crisis. He said the Albanian government had been going
all out and would continue to do so to bring the Rambouillet peace
deal into effect.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, who came to Tirana after visits to Belgrade, Pristina -
- the provincial capital of Kosovo, and the Macedonian capital
city of Skopje, said the signing of the peace agreement was the
only way to restore peace in Kosovo. He called for a full
implementation of both its military and political requirements.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday morning, Fischer said in Skopje that the realization
of peace in the Balkan region was the prerequisite for accelerated
development there.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Evander Holyfield of the United
States said he would win the heavyweight title fight with a knock-
out victory over Lennox Lewis of Britain.
</P>
<P>
"I'm still holding to the truth," Holyfield said. "The truth is
I'm going to knock him out in the third round."
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old IBF-WBA champion is the 6-5 favorite to keep
his title and grab Lewis' WBC crown at Madison Square Garden in
New York on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"I'm not asking anybody here to believe that," Holyfield said
of his boast after training Tuesday. "I'm not asking anybody to
write that, but you can write it now or write it later."
</P>
<P>
"Preposterous," Lewis said of Holyfield's prediction.
</P>
<P>
Lewis, who trained Tuesday afternoon at The Theater in the
Garden complex, replied. "Yes, I'm predicting he will not knock me
out in the third round."
</P>
<P>
Holyfield, in his last fight, went the 12-round distance in
outpointing Vaughn Bean on September 19, and Lewis has said
Holyfield looked very ordinary.
</P>
<P>
"Bean's goal was just to survive and not win," Holyfield said.
"Lennox is coming to win, and because Lennox is coming to win that
makes it a great fight, but a short fight."
</P>
<P>
Lewis, however, said:"He should have knocked Vaughn Bean out in
the third round and not predicting he will knock me out."

<HEADLINE> China Steps up River-Harnessing after Flooding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The catastrophic summer flooding
of 1998 served as a dose of stimulant to China, increasing its
awareness of the importance of flood prevention and making flood
control a most-discussed and most-concerned topic at the ongoing
session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the nation'
s highest legislature.
</P>
<P>
Describing lessons from the flooding as "costly", governor of
Hubei province Jiang Zhuping said, "Although China was able to
overcome the flooding last year with water control facilities
built after the founding of New China, weakness was also exposed
in the facilities." Hubei is one of the most severely-affected
provinces during the 1998 flooding.
</P>
<P>
Guo Shenglian, a water control expert from Hubei said
embankments in China are not high enough to stand against severe
floods. "People will have to risk their lives to fight floods in
flood seasons. Still, spring and seepage are common in the dikes
which are made higher hurriedly in urgent situations, as happened
last summer along the Nengjiang and Songhua rivers in northeastern
China's Heilongjiang province." he said.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict severe flooding could hit China this year.
Xiong Jiazhen, a farmer NPC deputy and also a frequent victim of
Yangtze flooding, said the 1998 flooding has sounded an alarm and
urgent measures should be immediately taken.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from Jiangxi, another affected province along the
Yangtze River, said, "The more efforts we put into dike building
in dry seasons, the less worries we will have in rainy seasons."
</P>
<P>
Cai Lifeng from Hunan province pointed out that increasing
occurrences of flooding in recent years have resulted from
population growth, environment pollution and soil erosion. "It is
necessary to make comprehensive improvements in a host of related
fields to have long-term, effective flood control," he said.
</P>
<P>
A water control expert to the NPC session said the family
planning policy should be strictly carried out along with river-
harnessing. "Over-population makes flood control more difficult
since it results in excessive land reclamation and excessive
logging, and hampers flood diversion," he said.
</P>
<P>
To the relief of the deputies, Premier Zhu Rongji pledged
greater efforts for flood prevention in his government work report
last Friday, for repairing water control projects, reinforcing
dikes along major rivers, and banning logging and land-reclamation
which destroy forest land and lakes.
</P>
<P>
China is moving to reinforce major dikes along big rivers in
two or three years till they can stand against the most severe
flooding since 1949. It injected a record 14.345 billion yuan (
about 1.732 billion US dollars) into such projects last year alone.
</P>
<P>
Provincial governments also learned a bitter lesson from the
1998 flooding, putting forward measures and pledging heavy
investment to shore up dikes and protect ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
To increase the rivers' floodwater storage capacity, the
central government has started a massive emigration project in
areas along the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. A
total of 940,000 local residents will be relocated, almost the
same as the number to be relocated for the building of the Three
Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
Jiangsu province stood the test of last year's Yangtze flooding
with the flood-control projects it had built after a severe
flooding in 1991. Its governor Chen Huanyou said Jiangsu will take
ten years to build a complete system of water-control facilities.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles Pays Homage to Argentinean Soldiers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The heir to the British
throne, Prince Charles, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day
visit, paid homage to the Argentinean soldiers killed in the
Falklands War.
</P>
<P>
Charles walked silently on a red carpet spread out in San
Martin square in Buenos Aires and placed a wreath of flowers in
front of the monument to the Argentineans who fell in the 1982 war
between Argentina and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Before the ceremony, the prince met with Argentinean President
Carlos Menem in the government house.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles said that relations between Britain and
Argentina had been strengthened in various fields over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
He described Menem's visit to Britain last October as an
important milestone in the history of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Argentinean Foreign Minister Guido de Tella said during his
welcome that the Prince's visit was a sign of reconciliation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain have long disputed the sovereignty of the
Falklands, known as the Malvinas in Argentina, which culminated in
a 74-day war in April 1982.
</P>
<P>
The two former foes restored diplomatic links in 1990 after
Menem came to power. Trade relations are now flourishing.
</P>
<P>
Menem's visit to London last year secured a partial end to the
arms embargo imposed on Argentina by Britain since the war.

<TEXT>
<P>
BUENOS AIRES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's gross domestic
product grew by 4.2 percent in 1998, despite a 0.5-percent fall in
the last quarter of the year, according to official statistics
released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The government said there would be no modification of the

In the last quarter, the Argentinean economy appeared affected

<P>
BERLIN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless people in
Germany rose by nearly 10,000 in February to 4.46 million, up 0.1
percent from January's 11.5 percent, the Federal Labor Office said
in Nuremberg on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
However, the jobless figure was 344,500 less than the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
As usual, the west of the country offered better employment
opportunities than the east. A total of 3.02 million people there
were unemployed in February, accounting for 9.5 percent of the
work force and 2,200 less than in January, the labor office said.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, 12,000 more people were thrown out of work in the
east of the country, leaving the total unemployed at 1.44 million,
or 19.1 percent of the total work force
</P>
<P>
The labor office attributed the increased unemployment in
February to seasonal factors.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Rebel Group Asks for Demilitarized Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTA FE DE BOGOTA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Colombia's second-
largest rebel group Tuesday asked the government to demilitarize a
zone in the northeast of the country before the renewal of the
peace talks.
</P>
<P>
The withdrawal of troops from part of the Caribbean area of
Bolivar, proposed last month, would guarantee the reopening of the
peace talks, said the National Liberation Army's (ELN) leader
Nicolas Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the ELN met last month on two occasions with the
Presidential High Commissioner for Peace, Victor Ricardo, in
Caracas, but failed to reach an agreement on a date or place for
the National Convention agreed last year.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government demilitarized an area of 42,000 square
kilometers last November in the areas of Caqueta and Meta to allow
negotiations with the main rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed
Forces of Columbia (FARC).
</P>
<P>
However, it opposes giving the same treatment to the ELN, which
is asking for a zone of expansion of 18,000 square kilometers in
Bolivar, an area fought over by the guerrillas and the private
paramilitary squads.
</P>
<P>
Nicolas Rodriguez added that the new contacts with the
presidential delegates must take place within the country, given
the failure of the meetings outside the country.
</P>
<P>
The ELN, founded in 1965, has about 5,000 members and used to
threaten to blow up oil pipelines in protest at petroleum policies,
based on contracts of association with multinational companies.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Deal With IMF Spreads Fear in Sao Paulo Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAO PAULO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The new agreement between Brazil
and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) led to a wave of
investor doubt in the Sao Paulo stock market, which fell by 3.8
percent at close Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced on Monday it would recommend official
approval for 4.9 billion U.S. dollars' worth of credit to Brazil
to support the country's revised economic program for 1999-2001.
</P>
<P>
According to the operatives of the Sao Paulo stock market --
the largest in Latin America, although the agreement with the IMF
showed its confidence in the Brazilian economy, it would cause a
great recession in the next few months.
</P>
<P>
The IMF also agreed to provide another 41.5-billion-dollar
international rescue package for Brazil, as arranged by the IMF
last November.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian economists have predicted an upturn in the economy by
the end of the year, but they expect the inflation rate to soar to
17 percent and the economic growth to be as low as four percent.
</P>
<P>
The forecast triggered panic in the Sao Paulo market on Tuesday,
with a volume of 257 million dollars traded, dropping about 50
percent compared with the previous trading day.
</P>
<P>
In Rio, stocks were down by 1.6 percent on the day, with only
51.5 million dollars traded.

<HEADLINE> Tibet Strives for GDP of Ten Billion Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tibet will strive for self-
sufficiency in grain, edible oil and meat, and achieve an annual
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of ten billion yuan by the year 2000,
chairman of the People's Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region
Legqog said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
Attending the annual session of the National People's Congress,
the nation's highest legislature, Legqog said Tibet has achieved
great success in political, economic, cultural and social fields
since it overthrew the rule of feudalist serf masters 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetans have become masters of the region since then:
Tibetan officials in governments of all levels in the region
accounted for 74.9 percent of the total in 1998, and all leading
positions in governments and committees of the NPC at all levels
are held by Tibetans at present, said Legqog.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan economy has also expanded. The region's grain output
reached 850,000 tons in 1998, 5.6 times that in 1959. Industrial
output has also expanded from zero to a projected value of 1.365
billion yuan last year.
</P>
<P>
Improved education reduced the rate of illiteracy by 47 percent,
and a total of 4,365 schools of all kinds have been set up in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan's lives have also bettered to a large extent: average
annual income of Tibetan farmers and herdsmen reached 1,150 yuan
in 1998, and average life expectancy increased to 65 years from 35
years in the past.
</P>
<P>
Raidi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the Tibetan
Regional People's Congress, said, "The history of Tibet during the
past 40 years proves that socialism is the only way to progress
and prosperity in Tibet. All the achievements in Tibet are based
on support from the central government, assistance from people
from the rest of the country, and hard work by the Tibetans."
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the central government allocated a total
of more than 40 billion yuan to Tibet between 1950 and 1997.

MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Vehicle sales in the Philippines
dipped by 39.7 percent to 7,250 units in February from 12,043 a

</P>

The report said that passenger car sales fell 49.7 percent to

<P>
Sales of trucks and other commercial vehicles went down 20
percent to just 3,223 units, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the continued drop in vehicle sales once
again highlighted the difficulties being encountered by the auto
industry as a crisis-induced tight credit situation continues to
turn off prospective vehicle buyers.

<P>
BEIJING, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's Industrial and
Commercial Bureau handled 10,004 consumer complaints last year,
involving compensation of 21 million yuan (2.5 million US dollars),
according to Industrial and Commercial Times.
</P>
<P>
On March 15 last year, a day dedicated to consumer's rights and
interests in China, the bureau opened a special hotline for
consumers to complain about bad services or commodity quality.
</P>
<P>
In the first ten months after the line was opened, the bureau
received 10,171 phone calls with complaints ranging from problems
with a box of cosmetics to cars and houses.
</P>
<P>
An official with the bureau told reporters that nowadays
consumers are becoming more aware of ways to use the law to
protect their interests, and the number and manner of consumer
complaints have changed dramatically in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said that five years ago, consumers complained mostly about
the quality of household electric appliances, shoes, food and
drinks.
</P>
<P>
But now the focus has shifted to the service sector, including
the beauty industry, tourism, finance and insurance, medical care
and post and telecommunications services, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to him, another change is the increasing number of
complaints that are handled expeditiously, as consumers become
more conscious of their rights in all transactions, great or small.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- In order to minimize the refereeing
errors, FIFA has planed to test the two-referee setup in the
professional leagues throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
FIFA said it plans to test the system in games starting in July
and running through the 1999-2000 season with each referee
covering half the pitch.
</P>
<P>
There was "lively debate" at the meeting of the technical
committee in Geneva, FIFA said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Eduardo Farah, president of the Paulista League in Brazil that
already has carried out experiments in about 200 lower-division
matches, said actual playing time was increased to more than 65
minutes and that there were fewer fouls.
</P>
<P>
The quality of the officiating has been improved because the
two referees kept an eye on one another.
</P>
<P>
"Better to use four eyes than four video cameras," said
Tahitian member Reynald Temarii, arguing that a human improvement
was better than the use of video.
</P>
<P>
UEFA also said Tuesday it expects to be involved in the trial.

HAVANA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Salvadoran man accused of
carrying out a bombing campaign last year against hotels in the
Cuban capital city of Havana on Tuesday asked for forgiveness from
the Cuban people and the family of a man who died in one explosion.
</P>

China set up the "Mediation Committee for Economic Contract

This effort has been proven very useful as disputes are likely

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Serf Becomes High-ranking Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Fifty seven year old Puncog, also the Party secretary of the
Xigaze Prefecture, was born to a serf family in a county of the
region. He is an eyewitness to the former misery and the
happiness which followed in the region after the Democratic Reform
started in 1959 in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In that year, the then 17 year old Puncog joined in the fight
against the armed rebellion instigated by the Dalai clique, when
the latter tore up the 17-Article Agreement for the Peaceful
Liberation of Tibet signed in 1951 between the Central Government
and the local government of Tibet.
</P>
<P>
In the old days, he recalled, serfs accounted for 95 percent of
the total Tibetan population and were at the mercy of serf-owners.
</P>
<P>
"Breath-taking changes have taken place since the Democratic
Reform. And beginning in the late 1970s, the Central Government
has enacted many preferential and flexible policies for Tibet to
help local people adapt to the market economy and improve their
lives," the serf-turned official said.
</P>
<P>
Puncog believes passionately in the sayings of the late Mao
Zedong and Deng Xiaoping, such as: the masses are the genuine
heroes; and development is the absolute principle.
</P>
<P>
"Our principle is to never let Tibet be split from the
motherland and at the same time never let Tibet remain
impoverished in the long term. So, the CPPCC committees at all
levels in Tibet will implement to the letter the Party's policies
on ethnic groups and religions, strengthen national unity, and
drive forward a well-off and civilized new Tibet into the 21st
century," he said.
</P>
<P>
Puncog and his wife now live together with their four children
and his 82 year old mother-in-law. He has been devoting much of
his spare time to self-education on the Tibetan and Chinese
languages. "I didn't receive as much schooling as my younger
brothers and sisters, which is my greatest regret," he said.

Government of the Tibet Autonomous Region, in southwest China, who
is here attending the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan leader made the statement Tuesday in an interview
with a group of Chinese and overseas correspondents.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan culture is an inseparable part of the cultural
treasure house of the motherland and has always been given top
priority by central and local governments at different levels.
</P>
<P>
Recent 20 years have witnessed a unprecedented development and
prosperity of the Tibetan culture, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the Tibetan language is a major course in local
schools of different kinds in Tibet and the autonomous region has
completed the translation and publishing of 500 kinds of textbooks
for primary and middle schools, according to the Tibetan official.
</P>
<P>
Tibetan language is the only one used for teachers working in
schools in counties, townships and villages in the autonomous
region, and Tibetan language and Mandarin are both working
languages in local governments of all levels and local news media.
</P>
<P>
Legqog said that over 50 research institutions on Tibetology
have been set up throughout the country, employing more than 2,000
people. These research bodies have held over 60 seminars and
published more than 400 academic works in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To this day, Tibet has completed a survey on local cultural
relics and discovered cultural relics in 1,768 places, the
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The central government has allocated huge sum of money for
renovating the Potala Palace, while the Tibet Museum which cost
nearly 100 million yuan has been completed and is open to the
public, according to Legqog.

BUENOS AIRES, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The heir to the British
throne, Prince Charles, who arrived here Tuesday on a three-day
visit, paid homage to the Argentinean soldiers killed in the
Falklands War.
</P>
<P>
Charles walked silently on a red carpet spread out in San
Martin square in Buenos Aires and placed a wreath of flowers in
front of the monument to the Argentineans who fell in the 1982 war
between Argentina and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Before the ceremony, the prince met with Argentinean President
Carlos Menem in the government house.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles said that relations between Britain and
Argentina had been strengthened in various fields over the past
two years.
</P>
<P>
He described Menem's visit to Britain last October as an
important milestone in the history of relations between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Argentinean Foreign Minister Guido de Tella said during his
welcome that the Prince's visit was a sign of reconciliation
between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Argentina and Britain have long disputed the sovereignty of the
Falklands, known as the Malvinas in Argentina, which culminated in
a 74-day war in April 1982.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Romania Hopes for Early Entry Into NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua)-- Romanian Foreign Minister Andrei
Plesu said here Tuesday he hoped that Romania would be admitted to
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in the next round of the
military alliance's expansion.
</P>
<P>
"I hope Romania can be a member of NATO in the next round of
its enlargement, better during (U.S.) President (Bill) Clinton's
second term, or perhaps before 2003," Plesu told a press
conference here during the "NATO at Fifty" Conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana told the
conference that the Czech Republic, Hungary and Poland would
become members "in three days' time". The three countries are
scheduled to be officially granted membership at NATO's Washington
Summit this week.
</P>
<P>
Romania had sought to join the military alliance for years. It
had expected to be included in the first wave to be accepted by
NATO.
</P>
<P>
Plesu said Romania would continue its efforts to seek
membership.
</P>
<P>
The "NATO at Fifty" conference is being held to mark the 50th
anniversary of the military bloc which was established shortly
after the Second World War.

LHASA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- Tibet managed to reduce epidemic
disease related deaths by 46.42 percent in 1998 from the previous
year.
</P>

A local medical administration official attributes this to
greater local government attention and steps taken by medical
establishments.
</P>
<P>
Tibet witnessed snowstorms in the winter of 1998 and heavy
floods in the summer and epidemic disease incidence increased 6.63
percent as a result, so the regional medical department sent 12
teams to assist relief efforts and distributed more than one
million yuan (120,000 U.S. dollars) worth of drugs. The medical
teams also held training classes on prevention and treatment of
tuberculosis and leprosy for the local people.

Tibet had 12,472 cases of infectious disease reported last year,

<HEADLINE> Philippines Drops Money Swap With Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 10 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has formally
dropped a proposed currency swap with Japan involving 800 million
U.S. dollars after the country successfully tapped official and
commercial creditors recently.
</P>
<P>
The Journal reported Wednesday that the proposed swap was
intended to raise interim financing and help cover the projected
deficit of more than 68 billion pesos (1.7 billion U.S. dollars)
this year.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, Manila would sell Tokyo pesos for the
equivalent amount of yen in U.S. dollar terms and reverse the
process after a pre-determined period of time.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson as
saying that the series of bond issues since the final quarter of
1998 up to present plus successful negotiations with multilateral
financial institutions for more loans allowed the government to
fully fund its financial requirements.
</P>
<P>
"There is no need for the proposed swap anymore," Singson said,
noting that negotiations with multilateral financial institutions
have kept the projected loan disbursement schedules on track.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the government was able to raise an initial
1.2 billion dollars worth of global bonds since the start of the
year up to present.
</P>
<P>
"I think the government has already raised sufficient funds
through recent bond issuance and has finalized concessional loans
(from multilateral financial institutions)," the governor said.

<HEADLINE> BASF And Bayer See Higher Profits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Germany's two giant chemicals concern,
BASF and Bayer, Tuesday reported healthy pre-tax profits for 1998
although profits were no longer in the double-digit range as in the
years 1997.
</P>
<P>
BASF said its posted a record profit for the third successive year
in 1998. Its pre-tax profit rose 1.7 per cent to a record 3.06 billion
dollars in 1998 from 3.01 billion dollars in the year 1997.
</P>
<P>
The chemical and pharmaceutical concern Bayer AG said its pre-tax
profit rose 4.5 per cent to 3 billion dollars last year on 0.2 per
cent lower sales of 31.02 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Following a supervisory board meeting at its headquarters in
Leverkusen, Bayer said it wanted to increase its dividend by 5.65
dollars-cent to 1.13 dollar per nominal share for 1998. Dividend
payments would again reach a record of nearly 0.85 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
BASF said it planned to increase its dividend by 10 per cent to
1.24 dollar per nominal share.
</P>
<P>
BASF said the profit rise came despite drastic price cuts of its
products in the second half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
However, the concern said it does not expect the positive trend to
continue this year. Group turnover already shrank to 30.57 billion
dollars last year from 31.53 billion dollars the year before.
</P>
<P>
"As a result of the continued pressure to cut prices the chemical
industry and BASF expect 1999 to be a difficult year," BASF said in a
statement.

<HEADLINE> Montenegro Abolishes Visa Requirement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Montenegro, one of the two
constituent republics of Yugoslavia, is dropping its visa
requirement for foreign travelers.
</P>
<P>
Velibor Zolak, the managing director of Montenegro's national
tourist organization, annouced this move.
</P>
<P>
But tourists wanting to visit the other constituent republic,
Serbia, will still have to apply for a visa.
</P>
<P>
A Serbina official in Germany talked of "Liberalizing tourist
regulations", but he refused to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia has been finding it difficult to attract tourists in
recent years because of sanctions and the Bosnian war.

<HEADLINE> All England Open Plagued by Withdrawls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BIRMINGHAM, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The All England Open Badminton
Championships, due to open here tomorrow, has been overshadowed by
withdrawls of several world top names.
</P>
<P>
Men's singles defending champion Sun Jun of China, who won the
Grand Prix Finals in Brunei last month, was forced to quit the
tournament due to back injury sustained in Beijing Open last week
while Chinese women's double shuttlers Ge Fei and Gu Jun, also
gold medalists in last year's All England Open, have to pull out
of the event after Ge Fei had an ankle injury in the Beijing Open.
</P>
<P>
Sun Jun was seeded fifth in the tournament and was scheduled to
meet Jean-Frederic Massias of France in the first round on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese players are not the only ones to give up the
championships. Darren Hall, England number one men's singles
player and 10 times national champion, was plagued by ankle injury,
Ong Ewe Hock of Malaysia, who was seeded 9th, had to withdraw from
the competition due to reaction to insect bite at the World Grand
Prix Finals in February. The Malaysian player finished runner-up
to Sun Jun last year.
</P>
<P>
While in the women's singles, English hopes for the title was
virtually demolished following three withdrawls. Julia Mann, four
times national champion, pulled out by ankle injur, Jo Muggeridge
quit the tournament due to illness and unconfirmed injury, Alison
Reed is still suffering from continuing injury and is not able to
appear in the court.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the individual withdrawls, the United States, which
had confirmed their participation in the championships, pulled the
whole team out because of financial constraints.

<HEADLINE> Ocalan's Brother Vows to Continue War for Kurdish State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) - Osman Ocalan, the brother of captured
Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah Ocalan, intends to continue the armed
struggle in Turkey, he said to German Press.
</P>
<P>
"We are now forced to rely on a violent solution," Osman Ocalan
told the magazine, which is due on the newsstands on Thursday,
according to a report of the German Press Agency.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah Ocalan, leader of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), was
seized in Kenya on February 16 and flown to Turkey in an undercover
operation that sparked a wave of protests by Kurds across Europe.
</P>
<P>
Osman Ocalan said that a political dialogue would only be
considered if Ankara released Abdullah Ocalan and recognised him as
the representative of the Kurdish people.
</P>
<P>
"Popular revolts" would take place in Turkish cities and suicide
attacks would be launched against military targets, Osman Ocalan said.
The 43-year-old is in hiding in the mountains of northern Iraq near
the border with Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But he said that the PKK would not wage war again in European
capitals and neither would it kill tourists.
</P>
<P>
The Marxist-Leninist PKK has for 14 years been fighting a war
against the Turkish government in an effort to set up a Kurdish state
of Kurdistan. Between 35,000 and 40,000 people have died in the
hostilities.

NEW YORK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Dow Jones industrial average fell
Tuesday for the second day in a row after sparkling gains last
week.
</P>

At the close of trading, the dow declined 33.85 at 9,693.76.
During the widely swinging session, the index gained as much as 71

The technology heavy Nasdaq index was down 4.68 at 2,392.94.
The decline was caused by rumors that Intel would report
disappointing first-quarter results.

The expectation by microchip maker Advanced Micro Devices on a
"significant" first-quarter loss late Monday also pushed the
Nasdaq down. The index finished up 60.51 at 2,397.62 Monday.
</P>
<P>
Broader stock indicators were also lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index fell 2.89 to 1,279.84 and the NYSE index fell 1.17 at
602.93.

<HEADLINE> Iranian President Visits Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Italian President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro Tuesday hailed his visiting Iranian counterpart, Mohammed
Khatami, as the driving force behind democratic progress and a
greater openness to the west in the Middle Eastern country.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the welcome dinner for Khatami, Scalfaro said "We
express great pleasure over the stamp you have imposed on politics
in your country and on the relations that Iran intends to have
with other nations."
</P>
<P>
Khatami, who arrived here Tuesday morning for his four-day
visit to Italy, is the first Iranian leader to visit a western
nation since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with Khtami, Scalfaro expressed satisfaction
over Khatami's view of Italy as a point of contact between his
country and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Italy is a bridge between Islam and Christianity and had an
important role in the European Union, Khatami said.
</P>
<P>
Khatami said Iran would do its utmost to bring about
"constructive dialogue and to spread the concept of dialogue among
civilizations and cultures."
</P>
<P>
However, he also said that "peace and liberty cannot be
achieved without dialogue in which each side respects the other
and recognizes their equality."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United States asked Italy to convey to the
Iranian president "international" concern over Tehran's stance on
terrorism and lethal weapons.
</P>
<P>
"Washington supports Iran's reintegration into the
international community", said the U.S. State Department spokesman
James Rubin.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The 9-day 1999 Special Olympics
World Summer Games will be held in North Carolina, U.S., and it is
expected to be the biggest world sports event of the year,
organizers said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The games, scheduled for June 26-July 4 will host 7,000
athletes from 150 countries and regions, President and CEO of
Special Olympics, Inc. Timothy Shriver told reporters at the U.S.
Foreign Press Center in New York.
</P>
<P>
They will compete in 19 sports including athletics, badminton,
basketball, cycling, gymnastics, power-lifting and volleyball.
</P>
<P>
Since 1968 when the first Special Olympics was held, the number
of athletes has been growing and there are now about one million
people with mental retardation participating in year-around
Olympic type of training and competition.
</P>
<P>
Shriver said such activities have helped these people to
enhance self-confidence and exchange with people in other parts of
the world.
</P>
<P>
Some 150 million people or nearly 3 percent of the world
population have mental retardation, according to World Health
Organization.

<HEADLINE> IMF Urges Kenya to Further Combat Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) said Tuesday that Kenya has adopted a "prudent" fiscal
policy but urged its further progress in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
On completion of an IMF mission's work visit to Kenya, the IMF
did not set a date for the resumption of talks on a stalled loan
package.
</P>
<P>
The IMF said in a statement it has noticed some progress in
civil service reform but it wants Kenya to increase its public
sector efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The mission said that among the four promises it has demanded
from Kenya, only one still remains to appoint a new director and
deputy directors for the Kenya Anti-Corruption Authority.
</P>
<P>
The Fund gave Kenya good marks for its prudent fiscal policy in
the first half of the current fiscal year, but demanded more
action to combat graft.
</P>
<P>
"The mission and the government are of the view that the
further strengthening of measures to improve governance in the
administration of public resources and to reduce corruption faced
by the private sector is critical to help enhance the growth
prospects of the country," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has launched budgetary reforms designed to balance the
budget in the fiscal year ending June 30, and regain a budget
surplus in three years.
</P>
<P>
In July 1997 the IMF suspended a 205 million U.S. dollars
three-year loan package to show its dissatisfaction with poor
governance and corruption in Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Again Denies Gun-Running to UNITA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambia Tuesday once again denied
the allegation of gun-running from Zambia to the rebel National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) as a group of
local and foreign correspondents visited Zambia's North-Western
Province adjacent to Angola.
</P>
<P>
Acting Director of Zambia Civil Aviation, Cris Lakah, told the
visiting correspondents that the airdrome in Zambezi, 90
kilometers from the Zambian- Angola border, was abandoned in
January 1997 and has no business since then.
</P>
<P>
He also said that the airport has no capacity to accommodate
heavy planes, which are allegedly used to supply arms to UNITA.
</P>
<P>
Recently Angola has repeatedly accused Zambia of supplying arms
to UNITA rebels and threatened to take military actions against
those countries backing the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government arranged the flight to Zambezi and
ground transport to facilitate the investigation by the
correspondents.

to Central America.
</P>
<P>

"Mitch", the hurricane caused 15,000 deaths and missed, destroyed
80,000 dwellings and caused economic losses of 4 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had a private talk with President Carlos Flores,
guarded by the U.S. military.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Crude Oil Retreats from Gains on London Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 9 (Xinhua) -- World oil prices surrendered earlier
gains to end lower on Tuesday, after a sharp rise driven by hopes of
further OPEC action to support markets led traders to cash out and
flee their positions.
</P>
<P>
London April futures for North Sea Brent last traded 19 cents
lower at $11.57 a barrel, having risen as high as $11.99 earlier in
the day.
</P>
<P>
The afternoon gains followed news of an accord between Gulf OPEC
rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran which could pave the way for more
supply curbs by members of the Organization of the Petroleum
Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia will present to other Gulf Arab OPEC ministers later
this week a compromise agreement over Iran's baseline for oil output
cuts, a Gulf source was quoted by Reuters as saying.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) oil ministers
scheduled for Wednesday in Saudi Arabia would examine the accord
and also study prospects for additional supply cuts by the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries.
</P>
<P>
If ratified, the agreement means Iran would make any further cuts
from its current output of about 3.6 million bpd, rather than the
3.318 million bpd quota it was assigned last year.
</P>
<P>
Iranian foreign minister Kamal Kharrazi will visit fellow OPEC
member Venezuela on March 17 for two days to discuss the oil
cartel's coming meeting on March 23 in Vienna.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela's Deputy Oil Minister Alvaro Silva said on Tuesday
his country would not propose further limits at the Vienna meeting
but would impress on other countries the need to comply fully with
last year's OPEC agreement to cut 2.6 million bpd.
</P>
<P>
Analysts have said the oil group needs to slice at least
another million barrels per day (bpd) to lift prices from last
year's 22-year lows. Non-OPEC producers like Mexico and Norway
are likely to be asked to chip in again.
</P>
<P>
Oil prices at about $11 a barrel on average so far this year
are running even lower than last year's $13.30, itself a six
dollar decline from prices in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Over 4,000 Congo (K) Refugees Cross into Zambia, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) reports that more than 4,000
refugees, fleeing intensive fighting in the Democratic Republic of
Congo (K) in the southeastern part of the country, have crossed
into northern Zambia since Friday, a U.N. spokesman said on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The arrivals say that more Congolese are on the way to Zambia
as anti-government troops are reportedly attacking targets near
towns of Lake Tanganyika, Fred Eckhard, U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Fierce fighting is raging on in the southeastern province of
Shaba in the Central African country.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman told a press conference here that "The refugees
area scattered along the border, near two towns of a distance of
60 kilometers."
</P>
<P>
"Some have found shelters in schools, churches and villages,
but many are sleeping in the open," he said.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR plans to put up makeshift shelters as soon as
suitable sites were found for the arrivals, said the spokesman,
adding that "already, there are 12,000 refugees from the DRC in
Zambia."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the United Nations has re-established a humanitarian
presence in Goma, east of the DRC, and the office is under the
leadership of the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and
includes a representative from the Office of the United Nations
High Commissioner for Human Rights, Eckhard said.
</P>
<P>
"The U.N. agencies will address the immediate needs of victims
of conflict in that country, priority will be given to providing
health care and food aid to some 68,000 internally displaced
people in the vicinity of Goma," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Tutsi-led rebellion rose up in eastern DRC with an
intention to topple President Laurent Kabila, who came to power in
1997 after defeating former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko.
</P>
<P>
Also drawn into the Congo (K) conflict were Zimbabwe, Angola
and Namibia on the government side, with Sudan and Chad joining
in some fighting for the government.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rwanda and Uganda support Congolese rebels, many
of whom are ethnic Tutsis.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Campaign for Nigeria's Readmission to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin Cook
Tuesday said that his country would be in a position to campaign
for Nigeria's readmission to the Commonwealth as a "fitting
recognition of the country's remarkable progress in
democratization."
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon held by his counterpart Nigerian Foreign Minister
Ignatius Olisemeka, Cook, who is on a four-day visit to Nigeria,
applauded the progress made by Nigeria under its transition
program.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria was suspended as a member of the Commonwealth in 1995
over its human rights violations and slow pace of democratization
and after the hanging of eight Ogonis including writer Ken Saro
Wiwa over the killing of four of their kinsmen.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, Nigerian Foreign Minister Olisemeka said that
Nigeria was on the threshold of a "new beginning" after the
successful conclusion of its presidential election on February 27.
</P>
<P>
"The past has gone and this is a wonderful opportunity to start
again," the minister said of Nigeria's relations with Britain.
</P>
<P>
During the past eight months, he noted, "Our country has become
more relaxed, human rights restored and we have set the basis for
the country's economic restoration."
</P>
<P>
The visiting British foreign secretary who held meetings with
Nigerian Head of State General Abdulsalam Abubakar said that his
visit to Nigeria was to enable both countries to look at ways of
restoring the warm bilateral relations after years of a chill
during the regime of late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Cook, who arrived here Monday, has held talks with the visiting
Sierra Leonean President Tejan Kabbah who pledged that his
government would continue to work for stability and the protection
of the legitimate government in that country.
</P>
<P>
The British government last week announced an additional
support of 10 million pounds for the peace-keeping efforts of the
west African peace- keeping force of ECOMOG in Sierra Leone.
