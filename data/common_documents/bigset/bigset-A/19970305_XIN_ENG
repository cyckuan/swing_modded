<HEADLINE> Small Businesses Face Big Problems in Ukraine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KIEV, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Corruption and red tape are now
strangling small-scale private enterprises that could help pull
Ukraine out of its economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"To open a small business, you must hand out nearly 2,000
U.S. dollars in bribes," Deputy Prime Minister Victor Pinzenkik
said in a press conference recently. "Or you won't get the
opportunity to work."
</P>
<P>
Corrupt bureaucrats are not the only expense imposed on
businessmen. Legitimate permits cost nearly another 1,000 dollars,
of which 185 dollars go for registration and 730 dollars for a
business license and other approvals.
</P>
<P>
So if a new businessman hopes to work legally, he must pay up
to 3,000 dollars, a large sum at a time when entrepreneurs face a
severe shortage of start-up capital.
</P>
<P>
The results are self-evident. Natalia Rozhevina, head of the
Association of Small Enterprises in Ukraine, said only 13 percent
of the 10,000 such firms registered in Kiev are viable. "The
majority of survivors are hardly flourishing -- taxes and
bureaucrats get in the way," she said.
</P>
<P>
A study by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) at the
end of last year found that small businesses account for a
declining proportion of Ukraine's legally registered
enterprises. Small firms accounted for 49 percent of all companies
in 1992, 37 percent in 1994 and just 31 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Andreas Nils, chief of the IFC's privatization project, said
small private enterprises employ just 5 percent of Ukraine's
workforce, compared with 20 percent in Russia and 70 percent in
Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
Government statistics confirm the IFC's studies. Deputy
Economic Minister Valeri Marinin said Ukraine's economy is still
dominated by large enterprises. The 150,000 small businesses in
the country report revenues amounting to just 3.7 percent of gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
Although the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
has offered Ukraine 121 million dollars in loans to support small
businesses, experts say that credits will not remove the greatest
obstacle to the development of private enterprise. The main brake
is a clumsy government policy toward small businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Small enterprises are having a hard time because it's
difficult to rid mid-level officials of Soviet ideas that cannot
grasp the concept of private ownership," said Alexander Paschver,
economics adviser to President Leonid Kuchma.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Quake Hits Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An earthquake measuring 4.7 on the
open-ended Richter scale hit Bingol province in eastern Turkey
today, the semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency quoted officials of Istanbul's Kandilli Seimological
Center as saying that the quake occurred in Bingol at 14:23
GMT and so far no immediate reports of casualties.
</P>

The officials said that the tremor also affected the
provinces of Erzurum and Tunceli.
</P>
<P>
The epicenter of the quake was reported to be Karliova
town of Bingol.
</P>
<P>
Earthquakes measuring between 4 and 5 on the Richter scale
are described as powerful enough to cause casualties in a
populated area.
</P>
<P>
Local press reported that 92 percent of Turkish land faces
the risk of earthquake, 95 percent of the population and 96
percent of Turkish industry are located at the earthquake zone.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier Warns against Relaxation on Farming </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng cautioned
here today that agriculture must not be neglected following a
record harvest last year.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion with Henan deputies to the Eighth
National People's Congress in session here, Li said that China's
record grain output of 480 billion kg last year should not be
regarded as an entirely true indication of the level of China's
agricultural production, as the weather last year was favorable
for crops.
</P>
<P>
"After a big harvest, we must not relax with regard to
agriculture and grain production," the premier said. "We must be
sober-minded."
</P>
<P>
He said that Henan, a major wheat producer with a population of
90 million, must not neglect the production of wheat, though it
reported a good harvest last year.
</P>
<P>
"We must keep in mind that there are bumper years and lean
years in our country's agricultural production," Li said, quoting
a Chinese maxim "get prepared for danger in times of peace."
</P>
<P>
"We have established a grain reserve system in recent
years," he said. "Though at some costs, we have had to do so to
ensure an ample grain supply in case natural disasters strike."
</P>
<P>
China has established a household-based farming system since it
launched the economic reform and opening-up drive in the late
1970s and today it is still a good policy able to arouse the
enthusiasm of farmers, the premier said,
</P>
<P>
"The policy should be further improved and developed," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that efforts should be made to develop the social
service sector and rural enterprises.
</P>
<P>
In many places, rural enterprises processing farm produce have
helped raise the income of farmers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the long-term, rural enterprises have a good prospect for
development," Li said.
</P>
<P>
On harnessing the Yellow River, China's second longest running
through Henan, Li said that the river was a cradle of the Chinese
nation but its floods pose serious trouble and danger.
</P>
<P>
Safety along the river has been the result of construction of a
number of water conservancy facilities, now eight at the upper
reach, he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for accelerating the construction of the Xiaolangdi
Project, which is expected to greatly increase safety along the
middle and lower reaches of the river.
</P>
<P>
"The problem of the Yellow River is not yet resolved and needs
comprehensive harnessing," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said China's economic development is not balanced and an
earnest effort must be made to reduce poverty, pledging that
existing funds and preferential policies for poverty relief will
be maintained in a period of time to come.
</P>
<P>
He added that as the national economy grows and the country
becomes financially more powerful, the government will increase
spending on poverty relief.
</P>
<P>
He called on the deputies to work hard and practice thrift in
order to get rid of backwardness.

<HEADLINE> SADC Free Trade Pact Still To be Finalised </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Trade officials from the
Southern African Development Community (SADC) have yet to reach
agreement on details of a plan to liberalise trade among the
12-nation trading bloc, said a source here today.
</P>
<P>
The Free Trade Pact, approved by SADC heads of state in
Maseru, Lesotho, last August, envisaged the creation of an
eight-year free trade area in the region.
</P>
<P>
The protocol also called for a linkage between trade
liberalisation to region-wide industrial restructuring and
promotion of new investment as well as cooperation in trade
facilitation, promotion and rehabilitation of port facilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the source quoted SADC spokesman Kgosi Moesi as saying
that only Mauritius had so far ratified the pact, more than five
months after political leaders gave their nod to the program.
</P>
<P>
However, Moesi indicated that a majority of members states were in
the process of ratifying the trade protocol, while some wanted to see
results of technical studies being done to establish which sectors and
product lines had to be covered by the free trade area.
</P>
<P>
He believed the delay was, in part, caused by the need of
governments to assess the sensitive sectors and to prioritise their
needs, but stressing that the political commitment to implement the
protocol was strong.
</P>
<P>
Last week, South Africa, which is currently chairing the SADC, gave
strong signals that it intended using the trade protocol to open its
markets faster to its SADC partners in a bid to rectify the long
running deficit the region had suffered in its trade with Pretoria.
</P>
<P>
The SADC comprises Angola, Botswana, Lesotho, Malawi, Mauritius,
Mozambique, Namibia, South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Zambia and
Zimbabwe. enditem

<HEADLINE> Clinton Imposes Ban on Federal Funds for Human Cloning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today imposed a ban on federal funds for any human cloning
experiments, saying the recent breakthrough in animal cloning
could raise troubling prospect.
</P>
<P>
"Today I am issuing a directive that bans the use of any
federal funds for any cloning of human beings. Effective
immediately, no federal agency may support, fund or undertake such
activity." Clinton stressed.
</P>
<P>
Because the privately funded scientists are not covered by the
directive, Clinton also asked for a voluntary moratorium on human
cloning experiments anywhere in the United States -- at least
until the legal and ethical issues can be sorted out by the whole
nation.
</P>
<P>
"I am urging the entire scientific and medical community, every
foundation, every university, every industry that supports work in
this area, to heed the federal government's example." Clinton
said.
</P>
<P>
Last week President Clinton asked National Bioethics Advisory
Commission to conduct a thorough review of the legal and ethical
issues raised by the successful cloning of an adult sheep in
Scotland, and to recommend possible actions to prevent its abuse
and to report back to him in May.
</P>
<P>
Previously, Clinton approved a ban on federal funding for
research on human embryos, experiments which might hold promise
for the treatment of disease.

<HEADLINE> EU Trade Surplus Rises for Fourth Successive Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's trade
surplus with the rest of the world totalled 28.52 billion
U.S. dollars in the first three quarters of 1996, up slightly on
the 27.83 billion dollars recorded for the whole of 1995 and more
than three times the combined trade surpluses for 1993 and 1994.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus was 7.13 billion dollars in 1994 and 1.38
billion dollars in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The trade surplus in the third quarter of last year rose to an
estimated 16.56 billion dollars, compared with 1.38 billion
dollars in the first quarter and 10.58 billion dollars in the
second quarter, EU's statistical office Eurostat reported today.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that the EU's external trade has been in
surplus for 10 successive quarters.
</P>
<P>
Eurostat attributed the rise in the surplus to the 12.2 percent
growth of exports in the quarter over the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
In the third quarter of 1996, EU exports to the rest of the
world were 174.80 billion dollars while imports were 158.24
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Germany had the biggest surplus of 44.62 billion dollars in the
first nine months, followed by Italy, the Netherlands and Sweden.
</P>
<P>
At the opposite end of the scale, in the red, were the United
Kingdom with a deficit of 25.76 billion dollars, Greece, Spain,
Portugal and Austria.

<HEADLINE> US New Home Sales Up Sharply in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- New home sales in the U.S.
increased to nearly an 11-year high in January because of
unseasonably warm weather in the Northeast and South.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department reported today that sales of new,
single-family homes reached a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
870,000, the highest level since March 1986. It was a sharp
increase of 8.6 percent comparing with the sales in December.
</P>
<P>
The gain in new home sales was also propelled by relatively low
mortgage rates and moderate economic growth.
</P>
<P>
The increase followed advances of 0.5 percent in December and
12.9 percent in November. For all of 1996, 758,000 homes were sold
in U.S., the largest number since 1978.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, the sales increased by 63.4 percent in January, the
largest percentage gain since April 1993. Sales also jumped by
11.9 percent in the South. However, they fell 10.3 percent in the
Midwest and 5.9 percent in the West.
</P>
<P>
The strong sales overall reduced the inventory of completed but
unsold homes to a 4.5-month supply, down from 5 months in December
and 6.3 months a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Housing was one of the key sources of strength in the U.S.
economy last year. Analysts are expecting another good year for
housing but not quite as strong as last year.
</P>
<P>
Sales of existing homes in the U.S. have been strong as well.
The sales rose by 2.1 percent in January to a rate of 3.94
million, according to the National Association of Realtors last
week.

<HEADLINE> Hun Sen: CPP to Continue Cooperation With Funcinpec </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Second Prime Minister
Hun Sen said here today that his Cambodian People's Party (CPP)
will act with the cooperation pact with the Funcinpec Party.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen, who also serves as vice chairman of the CPP, said that
he did not read the monthly bulletin in which King Norodom
Sihanouk expressed his intention to abdicate his throne, noting
the king is the head of state for ever according to the current
constitution.
</P>
<P>
The second prime minister made the remarks today at the signing
ceremony for officially forming a political alliance between the
CPP and the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen said the relations between the CPP and the Funcinpec
will be put to track as defined in the 1991 pact between the two
parties.
</P>
<P>
The two parties became partners in the coalition of the Royal
Government following the 1993 national elections. But the
relations between them became tense in the past months, climaxing
at bloodshed clashes in Battambang province last month between
soldiers loyal to the two parties.
</P>
<P>
Hun Sen confirmed that at the High Command meeting last week,
First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh and himself,
co-commanders-in-chief of the armed forces, agreed to give
additional mandate to a eight-member committee solving the
partisan armed conflicts in Battambang.

<HEADLINE> Senior Leader Calls for Assistance to Laid-off Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A ranking Chinese official today
calls on governments at all levels to try their best to guarantee
the basic needs of the laid-off workers from the state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Both long-term measures that address the root cause of
unemployment and some emergency ones are required to help those in
want, said Li Ruihuan, member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
With China's ongoing efforts to reshuffle its failing
state-owned sector, a growing number of people have lost their
jobs and found it increasingly difficult to make both ends meet.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), called
for establishing special bodies to deal with the problem in an
all-round way, while attending a panel discussion of the Tianjin
deputies to the ongoing session of the National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The head of China's top advisory body suggested specific
measures to be taken for tackling the problem. "We should rather
cut back the number of new projects and slow down the growth
speed, to ensure that people will have enough to eat."
</P>
<P>
Some public welfare projects should be launched to create more
jobs opportunities, and people should be encouraged to carry on
the traditional virtue of helping the needy and establish charity
funds, he suggested.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Li noted, some funds should be raised among those
people on jobs, individual income taxes should be adjusted and
other methods used to help the laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
More work should be done, education enhanced and new concepts
on jobs selection should be fostered, Li said. "If there is a job
but you rejects it, and then the government is not to blame."
</P>
<P>
A growing number of the unemployed is an unavoidable phenomenon
during the course of establishing a socialist market economy,
since the market competition necessitates the elimination of those
poorly managed, he explains.
</P>
<P>
However, he noted, since the problem concerns the livelihood of
some people, which will have a direct bearing on social stability,
and reform and opening-up, it must be handled properly.
</P>
<P>
"The basic purpose of the Communist Party and the People's
government is to serve the people whole-heartedly, and the problem
must be addressed," Li affirmed.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, Li Ruihuan also expressed his approval
of Premier Li Peng's government work report to the current NPC
session, and shared views with NPC deputies from Tianjin on topics
ranging from promotion of science and technology, acceleration of
the reform pace of state-owned enterprises, to the role of Tianjin
municipalities (one of China's three existing municipalities) to
be played in national economy.

KAMPALA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has

A statement by Ugandan Minister of State for Regional

Uganda has always strictly adhered to the stipulations of the

<P>
The statement further said that the false allegations in the

are reminiscent of the repeated baseless propaganda by the Sudan.

<P>
The gain in the Index of Leading Economic Indicators, released
today by the New York based Conference Board, follows a 0.1
percent rise in December and a revised 0.1 percent increase in
November. Wall Street had been expecting a similar gain in
January.
</P>
<P>
The leading index itself is designed to forecast economic
activity six to nine months in advance. Thus, its January gain
suggests the economy will continue to expand at least through the
Summer.
</P>
<P>
Other recent economic news supports that belief.
</P>
<P>
Of its 10 components of the index, six rose for the month. The
biggest help came from rising manufacturers' orders for consumer
goods and falling weekly unemployment claims. Components hurting
the index most were retail vendor performance and the average
factory workweek.
</P>
<P>
The index's January reading of 103.0 compares with a revised
102.7 in December and a revised November level of 102.6. The index
operates from a base of 100, set in 1987.

<HEADLINE> Athlete Admitted Taking EPO During Olympic Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAUSANNE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- A male athlete was drove out of
the Atlanta Olympics after admitting taking the killer drug
erythropoietin (EP0), according to local reports on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The athlete from Eastern Europe admitted to the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) that he was taking the drug, a leading
IOC official said.
</P>
<P>
"An athlete was expelled from the Olympic village after he
confessed to the medical commission that he had used EPO," IOC
medical commission vice-president Jacques Rogge said in an
interview with Danish television on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The IOC has not taken any further action against the athlete
involved. In the past, athletes such as former German sprinter
Katrin Krabbe have been banned for unsportsmanlike conduct after
admitting to taking banned substances.
</P>
<P>
EPO, which was first introduced in the mid-1980s to treat
kidney disease, is one of the most dangerous drugs used by
athletes and is suspected to have killed 18 cyclists in Europe in
the last 10 years.

<HEADLINE> Nambia Promotes Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Nambia has launched a
community-based tourism project in a bid to benefit all
Namibians, the Southern African Broadcasting Association (SABA)
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Namibian Minister of Tourism and Environment Gert Hanekom
described the Damaraland Camp Project as a significant step
toward the country's socio-economic development.
</P>
<P>
The scheme, located on the Huab River in northwestern Namibia,
is a joint venture between the privately-owned Wilderness Safaris
and the Bergsig-De-Riet people.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement on the joint venture, the camp and its
assets will ultimately be the property of the Bergsig-De Riet
people, one of Namibia's poor minorities, living alongside the
Huab River.
</P>
<P>
The community-private sector project is designed to raise
national income, increase employment in the formal and informal
sectors, reduce income disparities between the rich and the poor,
and alleviate poverty, Hanekom said.
</P>
<P>
More than 200,000 U.S. Dollars have been allocated to the
project, which will benefit 11 communities along the Huab River,
SABA said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Direct Talks in Cyprus Expected Soon, UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations hopes that
direct negotiations between Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash will be in the cards in
the first half of 1997, a U.N. official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Gustave Feissel, resident representative for Cyprus of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan, was telling reporters after an
hour-long meeting with Clerides at the Presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
He said "our objective is to get the two leaders together
soon, and everybody is talking about the first half of 1997 and
hopefully that will be the case."
</P>
<P>
Feissel said he briefed the Cypriot president on his recent
discussions in New York with the U.N. chief and reiterated U.N.
determination to move things forward so that the two leaders can
meet as soon as possible in the middle of this year.
</P>
<P>
"We are working very hard to make such a meeting possible,"
he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Asked if the talks could take place in Cyprus, Feissel said
"that remains to be seen, but obviously there are advantages in
doing it elsewhere."
</P>
<P>
However, the U.N. representative said the venue for the talks
was not discussed with Clerides.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Kofi Annan sent letters to Clerides and Denktash,
Greece and Turkey in which he expressed his determination to move
things forward.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
occupied the northern third of the island in the wake of an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. and international community have intensified their
efforts since this year to try to bring an early solution to the
protracted Cyprus problem.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Pledges to Continue Mideast Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat said on Tuesday his People will carry on with the peace
process in the Middle East in spite of all difficulties made by
the Israel's current Likud government on their road toward the
goal set by him and late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin.
</P>
<P>
"We have no other alternative. And in spite all of the
difficulties, which we are taking, we have one alternative, to
carry on with the peace process," Arafat told reporters at a news
conference at the National Press Club in Washington D.C..
</P>
<P>
"That is our strategic target, and we are insisting to carry on
with it," he repeated his emphasis on his continued job in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government approved a plan last Wednesday to
establish 6,500 Jewish homes in Abu Ghenaim, east Jerusalem, which
was captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli decision on housing project has drawn world wide
criticism and U.S. President Bill Clinton accused Israel of
building "mistrust" on Monday when he met visiting Arafat at the
White House for talks over the controversial Israeli housing plan.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he had a "very constructive, positive, warm talks"
with Clinton, who gave the Palestinians the support by denouncing
Israel's decision on the Jewish settlement in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say and I haven't the right to say what he (Clinton)
is going to do, but I am sure he will push forward with all his
capability, with all his capacity, to save the peace process," the
Palestinian leader said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat stressed that Israel's decision to establish new Jewish
homes in east Jerusalem was violating an agreement between him and
Rabin, which stipulates that no demographic change to be done
during the transitional period, including settlements, including
the situation of Jerusalem....
</P>
<P>
"The last decision to build a new settlement in Abu Ghehaim
Mountain is a real challenge to the peace process because it
will isolate Jerusalem more and more and more and more, and to
separate between Jerusalem and Bethlehem," he said.

<HEADLINE> US Fed Chairman Says Inflation Overstated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan said today that inflation in the U.S. is
overstated and renewed his call to fix the inflation gauge.
</P>
<P>
Testifying before the Budget Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives, Greenspan said, "The best available evidence
suggests that there is almost a 100 percent probability that we
are overcompensating the average Social Security recipient for
increases in the cost of living."
</P>
<P>
He said that because the CPI is also used to adjust individual
income taxes, the upward bias also means that there is a "100
percent probability that we are causing the inflation-adjusted
burden of the income tax system to decline more rapidly than I
presume Congress intends."
</P>
<P>
The Fed Chairman suggested the U.S. Congress adopt a two-track
approach to revise the Consumer Price Index (CPI) so that it will
provide a better yardstick for adjusting benefits and the income
tax system to compensate for inflation.
</P>
<P>
A five-member Congressional advisory commission headed by
Stanford economist Michael Boskin has said the current CPI
overstated the U.S. inflation by 1.1 percentage points annually.
</P>
<P>
The panel said if this bias is not corrected it will cost the
government 1 trillion dollars in overly generous pension payments
and incorrect adjustments to tax returns over the next decade.
</P>
<P>
Supporting the conclusions, Greenspan said there was a "very
high probability" that the exaggeration in the CPI ranges between
0.5 percentage point and 1.5 percentage points per year.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan's suggestion for an independent group of experts
received support in the past week from both Republicans in the
U.S. Senate and the White House.
</P>
<P>
However, the American Association of Retired Persons argues
that any changes affecting the CPI should be made only by the
experts at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the agency that
produces the inflation gauge.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 million Americans are receiving Social Security
and other government benefits and their benefits will be reduced
if the inflation gauge is revised down. Enitem

<HEADLINE> Tourism Starts Recovering in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- After the conclusion of the
Hebron Agreement between Israel and the Palestinians in January,
signs are pointing to a recovery of the tourism in this country,
Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Avraham Rosental, director-general of the
Israeli Hotel Association, as saying that reservations in local
hotels have been up since the implementation of the Hebron
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rosental said that after six months of decline in the number of
tourists coming to Israel, tourist operators are suggesting that
the recovery they have been waiting for has finally started.
</P>
<P>
After a series of suicide bombing attacks in February and March
last year, and later a serious armed confrontation between Israeli
soldiers and Palestinian police in September, which left dozens of
death respectively, Israel's tourism industry had suffered a huge
set back in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Rosental said that the Israeli government and private tourist
operators, as well as the Hotel Association, are carrying out
market promotions in Europe and the United States to attract
tourists.
</P>
<P>
Rosental stressed the importance of the continuation of Middle
East peace process in helping further develop the tourism industry
in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel and together with the whole Middle
East is a very attractive market for visitors, but, "only a
right peaceful environment will bring more tourists to an
area."

<HEADLINE> No BSE Risk from Cows Milk: EU Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- EU scientists said in a report
issued today that there is no risk of transmission of the
BSE(Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy) disease from cows' milk.
</P>
<P>
"The report concludes that bovine milk from clinically healthy
cows and products made from it can be safely consumed," European
Commission agriculture spokesman Gerard Kiely told a press
briefing.
</P>
<P>
The EU's scientific Veterinary Committee nonetheless said in
the report that current controls which prohibit the consumption of
milk from clinically suspect cattle should be maintained.
</P>
<P>
The Committee also concluded that the controls should be
extended to include colostrum from cattle suspected to have BSE.
Colostrum is secreted from cows to feed calves after giving birth.
</P>
<P>
But it added that exceptions can be made for colostrum or milk
from such cattle used to feed the cow's own calf.
</P>
<P>
The EU scientific committee had been examining the interim
results of a British study that suggested that cows could transmit
BSE to their calves.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission said in August 1996 that pending
further scientific research that there was no scientific evidence
that milk carries BSE or mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a worldwide ban in March 1996 on all exports of
British beef and derived products in order to protect public
health.
</P>
<P>
The ban followed a British government admission of a probable
link between BSE and a deadly human equivalent Creutzfeldt-Jakob
Disease.

<HEADLINE> Food Security Threatened in SADC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Recent political and economic
changes in the Southern African Development Community (SADC) have
weakened the region's original aim of having a sound food
security policy, a SADC official claimed here today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates to a three-day conference on new food
strategies, SADC Deputy Executive Secretary Lengolo Monyane said
the change in regional governments' approaches to economic
management meant that the objective of food security could no
longer be achieved as was originally anticipated.
</P>
<P>
If improvements in food security were to be realised, he said,
there should be broad participation of all stakeholders in the
reduction of malnutrition in the region.
</P>
<P>
He said given the new economic and political setting in which
it was now operating, SADC as an economic grouping was now facing
enormous challenges.
</P>
<P>
He said some countries in SADC had a great potential for
agriculture, but required investment in infrastructure to realise
this asset.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which ends on Thursday, is part of a process
to appraise the functions of the SADC food, agriculture and
natural resources sub-sector and see how it can contribute to
food security in the region.
</P>
<P>
European Union representative to Zimbabwe Michael Laidler
stressed southern African countries should start thinking new
ways of ensuring permanent food security in a region prone to
recurrent droughts.
</P>
<P>
He said a regional food security financing facility should be
arranged.
</P>
<P>
He added the EU was funding a six million US Dollars regional
food security training project aimed at building up the regional
training capacity by strengthening existing training
institutions. enditem

LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Four billion pounds (6.4 billion US
dollars) will be invested in London's leisure industries before
2000, business campaign group London First announced here today.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Relative Calm Returns to South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Following a week of tension, a
relative calm returned to south Lebanon today except sporadic
shellings by Israeli forces at suspected guerrillas targets.
</P>
<P>
Security sources reported several 155mm artillery shells fired
by the Israeli occupation forces in the Israeli self-proclaimed
"security zone" hitting vicinities of the south Lebanese market
town of Nabatiyeh without causing casualties.
</P>
<P>
Israeli warplanes hovered at low altitude over Western Beqaa
in southeast Lebanon over the night and during the daytime.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters also carried out reconnaissance flights
over the area of Sour in the western sector of south Lebanon,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
In a relative development, a five-nation committee monitoring
a limited truce on the Lebanese-Israeli border called today on
all the fighting parties in south Lebanon to comply with a
cease-fire understanding which Lebanon and Israel reached in
April, 1996.
</P>
<P>
The cease-fire monitoring committee comprising representatives
of France, Israel, Lebanon, Syria and the United States ended a
20-hour meeting at the south Lebanese border town of Naqoura this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Delegates of the five countries held the meeting in the
headquarters of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) to
discuss an Israeli complaint over an alleged breach of the
ceasefire understanding by the Lebanese resistance fighters last
week.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued at the end of the meeting, the monitoring
group "unanimously reiterates the necessity that all the fighters
should completely comply with the April understanding (1996) which
barres attacks from and on civilian areas."
</P>
<P>
"The group demands all the parties to avoid directly or
indirectly using ways of military operations which could expose
civilians to risks, and it calls for an observance of
self-restraint," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Lebanese foreign ministry sources said that during the
meeting, the Lebanese delegation rejected the Israeli claims that
the resistance had violated the April truce by mounting an attack
from a civilian area last Friday.
</P>
<P>
One Israeli soldier was killed and three others were wounded in
the Ambush inside the Israeli buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said
that the Lebanese team presented photographs of damage the Israeli
retribution caused in a string of village facing the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Seven Lebanese civilians have been killed in Israeli
bombardment in south Lebanon since the end of a 17-day Israeli
blitz in south Lebanon last April, in which some 200 Lebanese,
mainly civilians, were killed.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up the 1,100-square-kilometer "security zone" in
1985 in a bid to protect northern Israel from cross-border
attacks.

<HEADLINE> OAU Welcomes Ban on Anti-Personnel Landmines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) today welcomed the recent
decisions of the South African and Mozambican governments to ban
anti-personnel landmines.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the OAU said the South African government
on February 19 decided to ban the use, development, production and
stockpiling of anti-personnel landmines with immediate effect.
</P>
<P>
The government of Mozambique on February 25
also decided with immediate effect to prohibit in its territory the
production of, trade in as well as the use and non-authorized
transportation of anti-personnel landmines, the release added.
</P>
<P>
It pointed out that the secretary general stressed the value of
these exemplary decisions of the two governments, which are fully in
accordance with a number of OAU resolutions on this issue and
strengthens the momentum generated by the Ottawa Conference held
in October 1996.
</P>
<P>
''Only such decisive acts by states and other
organizations can put an end to the terrible consequences caused
by the generalized and indiscriminats use of landmines,'' the release
stressed.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general, however, deplored the severe negative
long-term impact which the use of anti-personnel landmines had on
the social, economic and environmental circumstances of millions of
Africans and their countries long after the end of the conflicts in
which these weapons were deployed, the release said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary general also appealed to the international
community to increase its assistance to the affected countries of
Africa in their attempts to rid themselves of this plague, according

<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 4 (Xinhua) - The Sierra Leone government on Tuesday
reacted to growing opposition against giving monthly pension benefits
worth 900 US Dollars to former President Joseph Momoh.
</P>
<P>
The government said in a statement that it reached the
decision in line with a 1986 act passed by the Sierra Leone
parliament.
</P>
<P>
''The governent had to streamline the benefits because the
original act called for many more benefits'', the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Under the 1986 act, Momoh was entitled to five office and two
household staff, four vehicles and 36 security personnel
including 30 personal guards.
</P>
<P>
The statement explained that the economic situation in Sierra
Leone cannot meet the demands and Momoh was offered instead
the 900,000 Leones pension, a house, two security personnel and a
car.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the leaders of all political
parties represented in parliament supported the pension benefits.
</P>
<P>
The pension, however, probibits Momoh from ''taking part in
active politics permanently'' and ''cannot be a leader of any
political party''. enditem

<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Zairean Foreign Minister Gerard
Kamanda Wa Kamanda today asked France and the United Nations to
take necessary measures to make a U.N. five-point peace plan for
Zaire "operational."
</P>
<P>
Kamanda, who is on a visit here, said in a declaration to the
press that Zairean rebels led by Laurent-Desire Kabila have
"categorically rejected all ceasing of hostilities."
</P>
<P>
He asked the United Nations Security Council to "enact
practical ways of control over the withdrawal and disarmament of
foreign troops, including mercenaries and militias, from Zairean
territory."
</P>
<P>
The French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt said
today that it is essential for all Zairean parties to "show
without ambiguity their adhesion to the five-point peace plan of
the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
He also said that "the continuation of fightings (in Zaire)
should be firmly discouraged by all those who can exercise their
influence in the region," and that France "asks its partners to
exert all the possible pressures to that end."
</P>
<P>
The United States Monday indirectly called on Zairean rebels to
stop their military actions, saying that "the pursuit of
fightings risks to harm" the mediation effort being launched by
the United Nations, the European Union, the United States and
South Africa.
</P>
<P>
The five-point peace plan, written by U.N. special envoy for
the Great Lakes region Mohamed Sahnoun, calls for an immediate
ending of hostilities, the withdrawal of foreign forces from
Zaire, respect of national territorial integrity, protection of
refugees, and a solution for the crisis through dialogue.

<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) - Tap water in England is increasingly
threatened with contamination by parasite which causes sickness as
water companies try to maintain supplies after two years of
drought, experts warn.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of families have been told to boil their water before
using it after a warning that they risk sickness and severe
diarrhoea.
</P>
<P>
The advice was issued by public health officials after 32
people became unwell due to a water-borne micro-organism,
cryptosporidium, which causes serious and prolonged stomach upset.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Three Valleys Water said it did not know how
the parasite, cryptosporidium had entered its water.
</P>
<P>
The decision to issue an instruction to boil water was taken
after an emergency meeting of public health officials with the
water company on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
More cases were confirmed soon after 300,000 notices had been
delivered advising people not to use unboiled tap water "until
further notice".
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Brent and Harrow said that of 12 confirmed
cases, 10 were children. West Hertfordshire health authority said
it had had three times the usual level of cases.
</P>
<P>
The parasite cryptosporidium is resistant to most
disinfectants, including bleach and water companies' chief
treatment is filtration.
</P>
<P>
The organism reproduces inside the gut and can be passed
easily from person to person, experts warn.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Rejects International Pressure on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu today brushed aside increasing international
pressure on Israel's decision to build a settlement in eastern
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with visiting French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette, Netanyahu said Israel was determined to go
ahead with the controversial building plan in Har Homa in
southeastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the Israeli leader announced the delay of the
construction work for a few days due to technical and legal
reasons. He denied that this was connected to his upcoming visit
to Egypt Wednesday, during which the Har Homa issue is expected
to top the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu rejected the mounting international pressure on him
to revoke the building plan. He said that, if not for technical
difficulties, Israel would begin surveys in Har Homa today. He
added that the surveys would be conducted in a few days and
bulldozers would be sent to break the ground within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
According to the Har Homa plan, Israel will build 2,500 of the
total 6,500 housing units in the first stage of the project
within three years.
</P>
<P>
On the further Israeli troop pullouts on West Bank which
should be completed by Friday under the Hebron agreement,
Netanyahu promised that the first stage of the three-phase
redeployments would be carried out immediately after the cabinet
made a decision Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television Channel I quoted Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai as saying that the pullouts could be completed within
14 hours after the cabinet decision. Israel is expected to hand
over 6 to 10 percent of the West Bank now under its control to
the Palestinian National Authority.
</P>
<P>
De Charette today also held talks with his Israeli
counterpart David Levy, during which they agreed to set up a
committee under their direct supervision to seek ways to improve
relations in areas of politics, economy, and culture.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister's three-day trip here is aimed at
mending ties soured by the stormy visit last October by French
President Jacques Chirac, who angered many Israelis by clashing
with Israeli guards during a tour to the Jerusalem's Old
City. Despite Israel's opposition, Chirac also urged it to
accept the concept of a Palestinian state, which he said would be
the only way to bring security to Israel.
</P>
<P>
France, which maintains traditional strong ties with Middle
Eastern Arab countries, has been trying hard to play a greater
role in the Israeli-Arab peace process to break the monopoly by
the United States. But Israel has rejected this demand, citing
what it called France's pro-Arab stance.
</P>
<P>
De Charette today deliberately denied that his country was
taking a pro-Arab stance, saying Paris had an open heart for
many friends. Perhaps in a good-will gesture to Israel, de
Charette avoided this time visiting the Orient House, the PNA's
de facto representative office in eastern Jerusalem.

Bosnia the expectation has been created that NATO controls just
about everything. NATO can not be transformed into a world
police."

It was reported that the Albanian government has imposed a
state of emergency in the country after repeated riots broke out.

General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the minister added, efforts to introduce
the program in all hospitals will be intensified in order to
cover all women living in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"Our goal is for every Cypriot woman to undergo an examination
every other year," Christofides stressed.

Christofides said check-ups in remote rural areas will be
carried out by a mobile unit.

against Lebanon to ensure a peaceful life for his people.
</P>
<P>
He made the call in a speech to Kuwaiti National Assembly
(Kuwaiti Parliament) this afternoon on the occasion of the
Israeli aggression agaisnt Lebanon 18 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Berri said, "it is the anniversary of the Israeli occupation
of dear parts of Lebanon, which are still occupied despite the
U.N. resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
He said Israel should implement all U.N. Security Council
resolutions related to its aggression against his country,
especially resolution 425, which calls for an immediate and
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel's 1978 invasion of Lebanon resulted in the
establishment of what later became the so-called "security zone"
to curb cross-border guerrillas activities against northern
Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese speaker also stressed that the Middle East peace
process was threatened by "Israeli attempts to judaize Jerusalem
and its repeated aggression against Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the recent Israeli decision to expand the
Jewish settlement in Har Homa of East Jerusalem by building 6,500
new houses for the Jews.
</P>
<P>
Berri arrived here Sunday heading a parliamentary delegation
on a three-day visit.
</P>
<P>
During his stay here, he met with Kuwaiti Amir Sheikh Jaber
al-Ahmad al-Sabah, Crown Prince and Prime Minister Sheikh Saad
al-Abdullah al-Salem al-Sabah, Speaker Ahmed Abdul Aziz al
Sadoun and other senior Kuwaiti officials.
</P>
<P>
He said upon his arrival in Kuwait that he was here to express
his gratitude for the assistance extended by Kuwait to his country.
</P>
<P>
He renewed Lebanon's support to Kuwait in its struggle against
foreign invasion and praised the role of Kuwait in supporting
Lebanon in its reconstruction process.

<HEADLINE> Paris Club, Nigeria Differ on Debt Figure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Paris Club of creditors is
pressing Nigeria to pay up its external debt, which according to
it, now amounts to 48 billion U.S. Dollars, instead of the 28
billion Dollars as claimed by Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The "Vanguard", a major Nigerian newspaper reported today that
the total debt is broken into 32.58 billion Dollars as capital,
and another 16 billion in unpaid arrears plus interest, according
to the Paris Club.
</P>
<P>
Also according to the club, Nigeria now owes 21.67 billion
Dollars to it, 4.41 billion to multilateral creditors, 3.15
billion in promissory notes, 2.05 billion to London Club and 1.31
billion in non-Paris bilateral debts, all excluding arrears and
interest.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's Finance Minister Anthony Ani announced in his 1997
budget breakdown that his country owes a total of 28.06 billion
Dollars to external creditors by the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
This includes 16.94 billion Dollars in arrears and 11.12
billion in interest, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, excluding penalties, Nigeria owes a
total of 19.09 billion Dollars to the 17 members of the Paris
Club as at November 30, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has paid more than 10 billion Dollars in payments to
private creditors in Europe in the last five years, the newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
To prevent its debt from further increasing, Nigeria has
stopped borrowing from the World Bank in 1996.

<HEADLINE> Egypt Slams at Israeli Settlement Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of Israeli Prime Minister
Binyamin Netanyahu's visit to Cairo, Egypt today criticized the
Jewish state's settlement practices, the Egyptian MENA news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Foreign Minister for Legal Affairs and International
Agreements Hussein Hassouna said Israel's policy of Judaization
and settlement in the occupied East Jerusalem is a violation of
international law and U.N. Security Council resolutions.
</P>
<P>
On the Israeli government's insistence on building Jewish homes
in East Jerusalem, the Egyptian senior official said that the Arab
stand on occupied Palestinian lands is based on legal principles.
</P>
<P>
He spoke of U.N. resolutions 242 and 338 and other U.N. terms
banning the seizure of land by force, adding that any change in
the demographic structure of Jerusalem is illegal.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mofid Shihab, chairman of the Shura Council
(consultative conference) Committee of Arab and Foreign Affairs
and National Security denounced the Israeli settlement plan as a
frank violation of Oslo agreements.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem and settlements issues top the list of final phase
negotiations, and none of the two parties (of Israel and
Palestine) is allowed to unilaterally undertake measures that
might affect those negotiations," Shihab said.
</P>
<P>
He said the decision reveals Israel's attempt to impose fait
accompli on the lands it has occupied prior to the negotiations,
to hinder the negotiating process and to pressure the
Palestinians and to determine results of negotiations in advance.
</P>
<P>
Shihab called upon the United States, co-sponsor of the peace
process, to take necessary measures to halt Israeli practices
which will obstruct the peace march.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's visit here Wednesday comes exactly a week after
Israel decided to build 6,500 housing units for Jewish settlers
in Har Homa (Gabal Abu Ghoneim), a tree-covered hill in East
Jerusalem seized by Israel from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast War.
</P>
<P>
Arabs regard it as an Israeli attempt to tighten grip on
Jerusalem, which the Palestinians want to have as the capital of
their future state.

<HEADLINE> AL Chief Calls on Asia to Support Arab Cause </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid today called upon Asian countries to increase their
diplomatic support for the Arab and the Palestinian cause,
according to the Egyptian Middle East News Agency.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting today with ambassadors from eight Asian
countries accredited to Egypt, Meguid said outside help is
especially important when Israel tries to intensify its
settlement schemes in Eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Israeli government continues its settlement
practices, thus violating the Madrid peace conference resolutions
and agreements concluded with the Palestinians, especially those
connected with Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"Israel, through these practices, aims to change Jerusalem's
demographic character in order to strike a new reality in this
holy city prior to the final phase negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the Arab leader said Israel should realize that the
Arab countries are not joining the peace negotiations because
they are weak.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, our belief in peace as the strategic option is out
of strength and confidence in the importance of peace to all
parties," he said, adding Israel cannot impose long-lasting peace
by force.
</P>
<P>
He said that Asian countries, especially China, Japan and
India, enjoy strong ties with the Arab states and consistently
support the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
The ambassadors, in their turn, reiterated their countries'
support for all U.N. Security Council resolutions on the
Palestinian issue, especially 242 and 338. They stressed the
importance of enhancing Arab-Asian relations.
</P>
<P>
Their countries do not recognize Israel's annexation of
Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War, said the ambassadors from
China, India, Japan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, the Philippines, Sri
Lanka and Pakistan.

<HEADLINE> American Expert Commends Tanzania's Efforts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 4 (Xinhua) -- An American expert today
commended Tanzania's efforts in fighting graft and called for
strengthening of the Prevention of Corruption Bureau by providing
it with adequate working tools and well trained staff.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference here today, Deputy Commissioner
of Investigations at the city of New York, USA, Kevin Ford, said
that he was highly impressed with the government's efforts in the
on-going anti-corruption drive in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that more efforts should be made to mobilize
the people to take part in the campaign. He also said that the
Prevention of Corruption Bureau must be strengthened to enable it
to cope with modern criminals using sophisticated tricks.
</P>
<P>
The American expert, who is on a two-week tour of Tanzania,
said he had met several government officials at the Prevention
of Corruption Bureau and the Leadership Ethics Commission, where
he shared with them ideas and experiences in fighting corruption.
</P>
<P>
Ford said that he was of the opinion that low wages in the
civil service, bureaucracy and existence of complicated
regulatory mechanism are among factors that fan corruption.
</P>
<P>
He held that revision of salary structures so as to provide
wages that will enable people to afford essential living expenses
is effective in controlling petty corruption.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the American expert said grand corruption could be
curbed by having a transparent system, where procedures for
awarding contracts and tenders should be known.
</P>
<P>
He, therefore, called for a campaign that will make all
countries pass legislation against foreign corrupt practices. He
said in some countries firms are allowed to bribe foreign
governments while in pursuit of contracts.
</P>
<P>
"Some governments waive tax for expenses incurred on bribery
abroad," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The American expert had some reservations of the leadership
ethics law, saying that much as disclosure of assets is a step in
the right direction in prevention of corruption at public
offices, more transparency is still desirable.
</P>
<P>
He said the public should have access to that information when
there is need.
</P>
<P>
Ford also called for closer co-operation between the
Prevention of Corruption Bureau, the Directorate of Criminal
Investigations and the Attorney General's Chambers in handling
cases.
</P>
<P>
The American expert said at the city of New York, prosecutors
work very closely with detectives and investigation officials, a
factor that has contributed to 90 percent success to all
prosecutions done.

LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Secretary-General of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) Javier Solana said here today
that he was confident of forging a partnership between Russia and
the 16-nation Alliance.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Royal Institute of International Affairs today,
Solana said: "I do not want to minimize the difficulties but I
believe they (the Russians) are interested in partnership with
NATO and we will conclude one."
</P>
<P>
The NATO chief, who is on a brief visit to Britain, noted that
there was "movement and momentum" in the talks between NATO and
the Russian government.
</P>
<P>
"I really am eager to have this mechanism in place as soon as
possible," he said. adding that "There is no question of buying
Russia off or compensating them for (NATO) enlargement."
</P>
<P>
"I believe that Russia will ultimately come to the conclusion
that a privileged relationship with an enlarged NATO is far
preferable to any other alternative," he added.
</P>
<P>
Solana also held separate talks with British Prime Minister
John Major and Defense Secretary Michael Portillo earlier today to
exchange views on NATO expansion and other issues of common
concern.

<HEADLINE> UN Team Accuses UNITA Radio of False Reporting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Angola
Verification Mission today issued a communique, accusing the
UNITA of unfounded reporting by its radio.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that the UNITA controlled radio has
released a series of untrue reports recently, saying that it is
not helpful to the peace process in Angola.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time the UN inspection team has criticized
the UNITA's radio for its unfounded reports.
</P>
<P>
In the communique, the UN mission urged the staff of the radio
to have a good knowledge of resolutions approved by the UN
Security Council and the Joint Commission of the Angolan Peace
Process in order to issue true reports and promote national
reconciliation in the country.
</P>
<P>
On February 28, the UNITA radio reported that Deputy Commander
of the UN peacekeeping troops based in Angola General Saksena
inspected central Angola city Andulo for having a grasp of the
military situation in that area.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that the government troops had occupied
some areas near Andulo and were ready to capture the city, adding
that the news had been confirmed by the deputy commander.
</P>
<P>
But the communique noted that the aim of Saksena's inspection
was to resolve the contradictions between local UNITA leaders and
UN peacekeepers there.
</P>
<P>
It also declared that the report was totally unfounded and
Saksena had never confirmed this news and did not mention the
matter at all when meeting UNITA leaders.
</P>
<P>
According to the communique, the UNITA radio also issued
distorted report on the Angolan peace process yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Organization Considers Suing Le Pen Over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The world's oldest international
Jewish organization B'nai Brith is considering suing the president
of the French far-right National Front (FN) party, Jean-Marie Le
Pen, over defamation.
</P>
<P>
Le Pen claimed in an interview in a newly published book that
French President Jacques Chirac was "taken hostage" by B'nai Brith
and other Jewish organizations by agreeing to lose in the 1988
presidential election "in exchange for enormous sums of money and
exceptional international support."
</P>
<P>
The Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted Tommy Baer, president of
the U.S.-based Jewish organization, as saying in Jerusalem that
his organization is now looking into the laws of France to see if
the declarations of Le Pen make up a defamation against B'nai
Brith.
</P>
<P>
In the book "The Novel of a President," a biography of Chirac
written by journalists Nicolas Domenach and Maurice Szafran, Le
Pen said that Chirac also had promised B'nai Brith that his
gaullist RPR party would never ally with the FN, even though it
needed the latter to form a majority.
</P>
<P>
Baer told AFP that B'nai Brith is "formally non-political" and
"has specific relations neither with Chirac, nor with any other
man of politics, no matter where he is."
</P>
<P>
Calling the remarks by Le Pen as "scandalously and classically
anti-Semitic," Baer said that B'nai Brith will tell France and
French people that the FN is a danger not only for Jews, but also
for all French people.
</P>
<P>
He said that FN does not "incarnate the better part in the
French tradition but represents the return to the time of
fascism."
</P>
<P>
"It is time that the French people reject Le Pen and realize
that he is a dangerous mishigge (meaning fool in Yiddish)," he
said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Islamist-Led Coalition Survives </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's coalition government led
by pro-Islamic Welfare Party (RP) Chairman Necmettin Erbakan this
evening survived a no-confidence vote in the face of a military
challenge which has strained the unity of the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The government won the vote 272 to 265 in the 550-seat
legislative. The motion was filed to censure the government for
granting high-rate pay hikes to army personnel and police
forces while ignoring other branches of the civil servants.
</P>
<P>
Erbakan's coalition has faced mounting pressure after a
warning from the military about increasing "fundamentalist"
activities and signs of discontent from the conservative wing of
the alliance led by Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister
Tansu Ciller.
</P>
<P>
Addressing his RP deputies, Erbakan said: "Parliament gives
the job of serving the nation to the government and the
government is responsible only to parliament."
</P>
<P>
Erbakan made clear he would disregard most of the commitments
the military wanted him to sign. He played down the deep
division which cast doubt on the strength of Turkey's democracy
and the chances of survival for the troubled coalition.
</P>
<P>
The National Security Council Friday presented Erbakan with
an ultimatum, demanding him to agree to a 22-point code of
conduct.
</P>
<P>
These included a return to ban on conspicuously traditional
Muslim garb, the limitation of clerical education, a
reintroduced ban on religion-based political parties, the
outlawing of recently-prolific Muslim sects and orders which
assail secular laws adopted from the West.
</P>
<P>
The government cleared another hurdle later today when the
parliament voted 274 to 258 against launching an inquiry into
Justice Minister Sevket Kazan, a main aide of Erbkan, over his
"anti-secular" activities.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Turkish President Suleymen Demirel,
Ciller said the coalition government would go on.
</P>
<P>
She dismissed accusations that the RP-led coalition government
had violated the state's constitutional secularism and her True
Path Party's (DYP) presence in the coalition was an insurance
for secularism.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: German Nuclear Waste Convoy on Its Last Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Against all resistance from
anti-nuclear protesters, a convoy of six lorries carring nuclear
waste from Germany and France today finally started on its final
stage of the journey to the storage depot at northern German town
of Gorleben, about six hours behind schedule.
</P>
<P>
The controversial shipment of nuclear waste from two German
power plants and a reprocessing plant in France, first began its
journey on railway from southwestern Germany last Friday,
accompanied by tens of thousands of anti-nuclear protesters and
guarded by 30,000 police officers in postwar Germany's biggest
security operation.
</P>
<P>
On Monday the altogether six containers of nuclear waste,
weighing 750 tons, arrived at the northern German town of
Dannenberg where they were reloaded onto trucks.
</P>
<P>
At 11:40 a.m. Wednesday, the nuclear waste convoy along with
police vehicles left the heavily-guarded Dannenberg railway
station for the final, snail's-pace stage of their journey to the
storage facilities at Gorleben, some 20 kilometers away in the
east.
</P>
<P>
About 10 kilometers from Dannenberg, at the village of
Quickborn, militant protesters were earlier in skirmishes with
police. Petrol bombs were thrown. Police later also discovered and
defused a home-made bomb along the road to be possibly used by
the convoy.
</P>
<P>
Overnight, several thousands of demonstrators trying to block
the shipment staged peaceful sit-in near the exit road at the
Dannenberg railway station. But they were forcibly dispersed
Wednesday morning by police using water cannons. More than 100
people were injured in the operations, and 38 people were
temporarily detained.
</P>
<P>
One bank employee was quoted by the media as saying after the
dispersal that "This is a power play. This is about principles.
The government has decided to act and it wants to have its way,
regardless of what people say."
</P>
<P>
Another demonstrator who was in a similar protest last year
said the police were having more difficulty this time because the
protest was better organized than last year and also have more
support from the locals.
</P>
<P>
The anti-nuclear protest has grown in volume every year since
the transport of nuclear waste to Gorleben started three years
ago. One critic described the event as "an annual nuclear
pilgrimage that has become part magnet for anarchic defiance of
the authorities and part token of Germans' deep concern over the
perils of atomic power".
</P>
<P>
Police officials and some politicians maintain that alongside
peaceful demonstrators, the protest has also drawn in others who
see the occasion as a pretext for violent confrontation.
</P>
<P>
Against that argument, the Greens Party, which is in opposition
in Bonn, maintains that the issue is not so much the transport of
nuclear waste as the use of nuclear power in general.
</P>
<P>
"There is only one alternative, to abolish nuclear power in the
face of popular protest," Gunda Roestel, a leader of the Greens,
said earlier.
</P>
<P>
That notion might prove to be unpractical, because nuclear
power covered 34 percent of energy supply in Germany last year,
the largest single contributor to the energy needs in the country.
</P>
<P>
But as anti-nuclear protest gathering momentum and turning more
violent, the security costs soared. Authorities say security for
the transport this time will cost German taxpayers some 100
million German marks (60 million U.S. dollars). A similar
transport in 1996 ran up a 46 million mark bill, compared with 25
million marks for a 1995 shipment.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Calls for Solution to New Problems (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today calls for the whole Party and the whole nation to seek
solutions to new problems at a time when China is pushing ahead
with its reform, opening-up and modernization programs.
</P>
<P>
Jiang, who is also the General Secretary of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and Chairman of
the Central Military Commission, made the remark when he joined
deputies to the National People's Congress (NPC) from Hunan and
Guangdong in discussing Premier Li Peng's government work report.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, "Problems encountered in practice can only be
further understood in practice, and correct solutions to problems
can only be sought in practice."
</P>
<P>
At the discussion with Hunan deputies, Jiang said that Hunan is
an agricultural province, and great efforts should continue to
boost its agriculture and rural economy.
</P>
<P>
He listed aspects that merit special efforts, including
improvement of basic farming facilities, diversification of rural
operations, development of rural enterprises, industrialization of
production processes, and use of science and technology in
boosting agricultural production, "so that Hunan will develop its
agriculture and rural economy to a higher level," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This is also a realistic way for agricultural provinces to
develop themselves into economic powerhouses," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that water conservancy facilities are among
the most important for farming.
</P>
<P>
Hunan has been hit by severe floods in recent years, he
pointed out, which resulted from both natural causes and
inadequate facilities.
</P>
<P>
"The first thing to do is to harness the Dongting Lake, which
is also an important part of the effort to harness the Yangtze
River," he said.
</P>
<P>
The president said reform, restructuring and renovation of the
province's industry should continue, and efforts should be made to
rejuvenate state-owned enterprises.

<TEXT>
<P>
The key to overcoming difficulties faced by state-owned
enterprises lies in boosting people's confidence and in deepening
reform, Jiang pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He called on the provincial government to focus on improvement
of pillar industries and enterprise groups that enjoy remarkable
advantages and development potential and whose products conform
with the state industrial policy and are needed on the market so
that they can promote the development of the entire provincial
economy.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on the province to open wider to the outside
world, improve the quality of opening up, and actively develop
economic and technological cooperation with overseas partners.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Hunan to develop economic cooperation with
western and eastern China, for common development and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He urged the provincial authorities to help people in
flood-stricken areas to rebuild their homes and resume work,
guarantee the basic livelihood of employees of poorly run
enterprises, and help the 3.5 million rural poor to have enough to
eat and wear.
</P>
<P>
In the discussion with deputies from Guangdong, Jiang said
Guangdong has made new progresses in reform and development,
as reflected by its smooth economic performance and the
effectiveness of macroeconomic control measures there.
</P>
<P>
He said that the late Deng Xiaoping had shown great concern for
reform and development in Guangdong and in its three special
economic zones (SEZ) of Shenzhen, Zhuhai and Shantou, and that his
inspection of south China in 1992 fueled reform and development
there.
</P>
<P>
"In accordance with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions,
Guangdong should try to achieve basic modernization by the year
2010," he said, noting that ethical and cultural progress in the
province should keep pace with its economic development.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the provincial authorities would "do
a better job of reform and development in Guangdong and in its
three SEZs" so that the province will continue to lead the country
in this regard and meet what Deng Xiaoping expected of it and the
Party Central Committee expects of it.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that acceleration of economic development in the
eastern part of the country, including Guangdong, will promote
development in the central and western parts and the country.
</P>
<P>
"It is a significant decision made by Deng Xiaoping and the
Party Central Committee that the eastern region should get
developed first to bring along and advance the eventual
development of the whole country to achieve common prosperity," he
said.

<P>
And eastern China, he noted, while speeding up its development,
should assist central and western China to achieve common
progress.
</P>
<P>
He said attention should be paid to properly handling the
relationship between economic growth and overall social progress.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed his approval of Guangdong's policy to establish
the three systems of a socialist market economy, democracy and a
legal system, and clean government and supervision, to improve the
three bases of agriculture, transportation-energy-information,and
education-science-technology, and to optimize its industrial
structure, its ecological environment and the quality of its
population.
</P>
<P>
The policy will be of great significance for maintaining a
sustained, rapid and healthy economic development, changing the
economic structure and economic growth modes, and promoting a
coordinated development of both economy and culture, and should be
carried out, said the president.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed the hope that Guangdong would continue to play
a pioneering role in reform and development, creating and
providing more new methods and experience for solving problems
encountered in the course of progress.
</P>
<P>
So long as Guangdong holds high the great banner of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics, unswervingly adheres to the basic line of the
Party, and pays equal attention to economic development and
ethical progress, Guangdong is bound to make new achievements in
all fields, he said.
</P>
<P>
On Hong Kong's impending return to China, Jiang said it is a
grand event for the Chinese nation.
</P>
<P>
He said the task at present is to make good preparations in
various fields to ensure Hong Kong's smooth transition.
</P>
<P>
The president also mentioned Macao's return in 1999, saying
economic exchanges and cooperation between Guangdong and Hong
Kong, and between Guangdong and Macao, have been increasing over
the years, promoting Guangdong's economic expansion, the
prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao, and economic development of the
whole country.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Guangdong would continue to open
wider to Hong Kong and Macao, increase cooperation with them in
economic, trade and financial fields, so as to promote common
development and contribute more to maintaining long-range
prosperity and stability in Hong Kong and Macao.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's top lawmaker Qiao Shi said
here today that with increasing support from the central
government, central and western provinces and regions should work
still harder and depend themselves for the economic development.

Guizhou Delegation of the Fifth Session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) to deliberate the government work report delivered
by Premier Li Peng on March 1.
</P>
<P>
He said that central and western areas are less prosperous
than the coastal provinces and cities due to geological and
historical reasons.

continued efforts of the central authorities to subsidize and
assist the central and western areas.

<HEADLINE> China Forecast to See Fastest Air Traffic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will experience the
world's fastest air travel growth over the next 20 years,
forecast the top aircraft producer Boeing Commercial Airplane
Group.
</P>
<P>
The air traffic in China is expected to grow at 8.7 percent
annually in the next two decades, according to Boeing's 1997
edition of "Current Market Outlook", which was released today. The
 air travel within the country is predicted to grow at 10.3
percent every year while the international traffic to and from
China, at six percent.
</P>
<P>
China will purchase one out of every ten airplanes to be
assembled in the next 20 years, according to the 1997
Outlook. China will add 1,900 new jets worth of 124 billion US
dollars till 2016, while the world as a whole will add 16,160
jetliners worth of 1.1 trillion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Boeing report said that the Asia-Pacific region will
outpace other parts of the world in air travel growth, with an
annual forecast of 6.6 percent. The worldwide air travel is likely
 to increase 4.9 percent per year between now and 2016.
</P>
<P>
"The industry continues on the upswing, with airlines ordering
airplanes to meet increasing traffic and accommodate higher
passenger load levels," said Bruce Dennis, vice president of the
Marketing Department of Boeing. He noted that Boeing would produce
 40 airplanes per month in the fourth quarter of 1997, the highest
 ever monthly output.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's vast regions inhabited by
ethnic groups are called upon to further promote economic progress
by tapping their potentials and bringing force their advantages,
said Xiao Shi, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National
People's Congress (NPC), today.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion with NPC deputies from Inner Mongolia
Autonomous Region, Qiao, who is also a Standing Committee member
of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC)
Central Committee, said most ethnics are located in remote areas
where economic conditions are poor. However, with the hard efforts
of the national minority people there, great changes have taken
place and much progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
He noted that further efforts should be made to create
conditions for tapping local resources and developing industries
that have local characteristics. In those trades apparent with
strong edges, it is necessary to introduce up-to-date technology
to improve product quality according to international standard.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi expressed his belief that with the support of the
government and joint efforts of all nationalities in the country,
the economy and other undertakings in ethnic regions will score
much greater achievements.

Qiao expressed his belief that Inner Mongolia and other ethnic
areas will make further progress in economic development,

of farmers, said Jiang Chunyun, vice premier of the State Council,
today.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion with deputies from east China's Jiangxi
Province to the National People's Congress which has been in
session since last Saturday, Jiang said the key to raising
farmers' income is to stabilize sown areas of major crops,
especially grain areas, and work for higher per unit output and
better quality of farm products.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Chunyun, who is also a member of the Communist Party
Central Committee Political Bureau, called for greater efforts to
purchase, process, store and market farm produce.
</P>
<P>
To relieve the financial burden of farmers is an important way
to protect the interests of the farmers and arouse their work
enthusiasm, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called for joint efforts by local governments at various
levels to work for a reduction of farmers' financial burden.

<HEADLINE> Sculptures of Zhou Enlai and Dong Biwu Completed in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Life-size sculptures of China's
late Premier Zhou Enlai and late Vice-President Dong Biwu, were
completed in the eastern city of Nanjing today to mark the
anniversary of their birthdays.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 99th anniversary of Zhou's birth and the 111th
anniversary of Dong's birth.
</P>
<P>
The sculptures were based on a photo of the two, taken in the
city in 1946, where they were negotiating with the Kuomintang as
representatives of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
The sculptures are made of a special kind of plastic that
reproduces the features of the two great revolutionaries quite
remarkably. They are being put in the Meiyuan Xincun Museum, which
was built on the site where the picture was taken.
</P>
<P>
City government officials and more than 300 teachers and
students attended the unveiling of the sculptures.

<HEADLINE> Sichuan Urged to Accelerate Economic Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The key for Sichuan province,
southwest China, is to achieve economic development in a faster
and better way through persevered efforts to center on economic
construction.
</P>
<P>
The remark was made by Hu Jintao, member of the Standing
Committee of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) Central Committee in a panel discussion with Sichuan
deputies in the annual session of the National People's Congress
(NPC), which has been in session since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Hu lauded Sichuan for the great achievements it scored last
year in reform, opening-up and modernization drive, agricultural
production, retooling of state enterprises and infrastructure
construction, in particular.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan is confronted with an excellent opportunity in economic
development, and the sustained, fast and healthy economy across
China has provided it with a good environment, he acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
The current NPC session will deliberated on the establishment
of centrally-administered Chongqing municipality, and this, too,
will grant the province with a rare chance for development, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he listed a series of policies formulated by the
Party Central Committee and the State Council to enhance economic
development in the central and western areas, and the construction
of the Three Gorges Project.
</P>
<P>
The ranking Party official called on Sichuan officials to
promote local economic development by consolidating the basis of
agriculture, and enhancing reform of the state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The theory of building socialism with Chinese characteristics
set forth by Deng Xiaoping, and the mature and strong leadership
by the party central committee with Jiang Zemin at its core are a
guarantee to maintain the stability of the party and the state,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu urged Sichuan, where late Leader Deng Xiaoping was born, to
carry forward at Deng's behest to build up the province.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean President Reshuffles Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 5 (Xinhua) -- South Korean President Kim Young-sam
today replaced 10 out of 28 cabinet ministers in a wide-ranging
government shake-up following Tuesday's appointment of Koh Kun as
the new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The reshuffle comes as the president tries to overcome the
country's serious economic problems and in the wake of the Hanbo
Steel loans scandal.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Han Seung-soo was
replaced by veteran politician and former finance minister,
60-year-old Kang Kyong-shik who is a lawmaker from the ruling New
Korea Party.
</P>
<P>
Lim Chang-yuel replaces Ahn Kwang-kwoo as international trade
and industry minister, Choe Sang-yup takes over from Ahn Woo-mahn
as justice minister and Song Tae-ho replaces Ah Byung-young as
education minister.
</P>
<P>
Kwun Sook-il was appointed minister of science and technology,
Kang Oon-tae as the home affairs minister, and Lee Hwan-gyun as
the construction and transportation minister.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Lee Soo-song, who together with his cabinet
resigned Tuesday morning, was appointed by the president as
advisor of the ruling New Korean Party.
</P>
<P>
President Kim apologized on February 25 for the Hanbo Steel
scandal. The company collapsed in January under six billion
U.S. dollars of debt, much of which had been amassed allegedly by
paying kickbacks to influential people. Three of Kim's closest
associates have been arrested in connection with the scandal.
</P>
<P>
Kim had already replaced his chief secretary and three top
presidential aides before today's reshuffle.
</P>
<P>
The nomination on Tuesday of Koh Kun, former Seoul mayor and
Myongji University president, made Koh the fifth prime minister
since Kim took office in February 1993.
</P>
<P>
Kim's term will end after the presidential election at the end
of this year. He is barred by the constitution from seeking
reelection.

<HEADLINE> Police Disperse Protesters by Water Cannons for Nuclear </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thousands of anti-nuclear protesters
were dispersed by police water cannons in northern Germany this
morning as they were trying to block the transport of nuclear
waste to a nearby storage depot.
</P>
<P>
The water cannons were sprayed as the demonstrators were
staging a peaceful overnight sit-in near the exit road from the
Dannenberg railway station, where nuclear waste from several
German power plants and a re-processing plant in France, was being
reloaded onto trucks to make its final journey to an interim
storage depot in Gorleben, some 19 kilometers away.
</P>
<P>
Police said they had to use the cannons to clear the road.
</P>
<P>
At another site along the route to Gorleben, 29 protesters were
arrested earlier Wednesday in clashes with the police.
</P>
<P>
Five policemen and three protesters were injured, police
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Militant protesters on the road near the village of Quickborn
threw petrol bombs at a police vehicle, setting it ablaze.
</P>
<P>
Later, a home-made bomb was reportedly discovered by police
along the road and was defused shortly before the first of six
lorries carring nuclear waste containers moved out of the
Dannenberg railway station on their journey to Gorleben.
</P>
<P>
Police suspect the bomb was the work of a militant group of
anarchists called Autonomen.
</P>
<P>
The road through Quickborn was believed to be the route the
convoy will take because the alternative southern route had
already been blocked by local farmers with tractors and other
heavy equipment. Protesters had also dug deep holes into the road.
</P>
<P>
With violence growing, it was uncertain if the nuclear waste
could reach Gorleben by Wednesday evening as originally planned.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng Confers with Legislators from Shaanxi (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng today confered
with legislators from northwest China's Shaanxi Province on a wide
range of topics, which covered agriculture, state-owned
enterprises, aid to the needy, and social security system.
</P>
<P>
The legislators, who are here attending the Fifth Session of
the Eighth National People's Congress (NPC), China's legislature,
were also joined by Vice-Premier Wu Bangguo and senior Party
official Ding Guangen.
</P>
<P>
After several legislators talked about Shaanxi's achievements
and problems in agricultural development, retooling of state-owned
enterprises, and establishment of the social security system,
vice-premier Wu made some explanations to the existing problems of
state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Describing difficulties faced by some of these enterprises an
inevitable outcome of the shift in economic structure and of
market changes, Wu noted that practice has proved that state
enterprises are fully capable of adapting themselves to the
socialist market economic structure well.
</P>
<P>
"A large number of state-owned enterprises have developed and
grown in strength through reforms and market competition, and we
are confident that the situation of the enterprises this year will
be better than in 1996," he said.
</P>
<P>
Giving consent to Wu's words, Premier Li said that it is a
major task for Shaanxi, one of the country's old industrial bases
specialized in the machine-building industry to invigorate
state-owned enterprises.

"A responsibility system for governments at all levels should
be introduced to the aid-poor work, and relatively less-developed
counties should be encouraged to shake off poverty by measures
like maintaining the preferential policies for them for a period
of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that varied circumstances should be
analysed and given differing treatment, and the aid-poor work
should be carried out in view of specific conditions.
</P>
<P>
When asked by Shaanxi deputies on the development of central
and western regions, he said, it has become China's major national
policy to give special attention and preferencies to these
regions, and the central government has adopted many measures in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
"We should first concentrate on accomplishing the
infrastructural and basic projects the central government has
already listed on the agenda," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that efforts should be made to accelerate the
establishment of a social security system that is compatible with
China's specific situation, with an emphasis on the minimum life
guarantee system and re-employment project, so as to promote
retooling state-owned enterprises and help establish a competitive
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's leading provinces outstanding in agriculture,
industry, energy, and science and technology, Shaanxi has its own
advantages and superiorities, the premier said. "The central
government is full of confidence in Shaanxi's bright future."

"The government work report has put forth six major measures
for revitalizing state-owned enterprises, and every state-owned
enterprise across the country must take effective measures in
accordance with their own specific conditions," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Besides essential aid and support from the state, he said, it
is also of critical importance for a state-owned enterprise in its
revitalizing process to have a good contingent of leaders, rely on
scientific and technological development, and gear its products to
the market demand.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Shaanxi, a major agricultural province,
has good conditions for farm production with a vast expanse of
fertile arable land and favorable weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Although we reaped good harvests in grain production last
year, we should continue to make every effort to achieve further
growth of agriculture," he said, adding that central and western
parts of the country should boost the construction of water
conservancy projects, and develop a water-saving agriculture.
</P>
<P>
He said that the central government would require relevant
departments to find out water-saving methods that suit China's
specific situation, and support the development of agricultural
science and technology with determination.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the aid program to the needy in the outlying
mountainous areas, he noted, Shaanxi has an arduous task of
poverty alleviation, and should first manage to provide adequate
food and clothing for people throughout the province.

<HEADLINE> Europe Needs Common Approach to Asylum Seekers: EC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- European Union countries should
work out a common approach to the issue of providing temporary
asylum to refugees, the European Commission (EC) said today.
</P>
<P>
The commission says the bloc needs to be better prepared for
the next possible mass influx of refugees into the EU and a common
approach in terms of time limits, social welfare and housing
should to be agreed in advance.
</P>
<P>
The EC, the executive body of the EU, says its new proposal
published today -- Joint Action on the Temporary Protection of
Displaced Persons -- aims at creating a framework for common
decision making between the member states regarding the opening
up, prolongation and phasing out of temporary asylum regimes.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also seeks to establish a minimum threshold as
regards rights and benefits for temporary refugees, including
access to the labour market, education, social welfare, housing
and conditions for family reunification.
</P>
<P>
There is currently no common approach among EU member states in
this area, and time limits as well as the status, rights and
benefits of those under temporary protection vary greatly from one
member state to another.
</P>
<P>
The conflict in former Yugoslavia resulted in unprecedented
numbers of displaced persons. Approximately two million people
fled from Bosnia, of which some 800,000 asked for asylum in the EU.
</P>
<P>
"There was no real co-operation between member states when the
mass influx from Bosnia occurred...Next time we are faced with
such a situation, we have to make sure that a fair and dignified
reception can be offered in all our member states," said Anita
Gradin, Home and Justice Affairs Commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The commission also pointed out that the proposed joint action,
which is intended for future situations, has no bearing on people
already under temporary protection, for example those who fled the
conflict in Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition to Vote Against Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Lawmakers of Nepal's main
opposition party will vote against a motion to be tabled Thursday
in the lower house by Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba to seek a
vote of confidence for his coalition government, a party leader
said today.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML), which is the largest party in the country's parliament,
decided at a meeting here today to order its MPs to vote against
the prime minister's confidence motion, Chief Whip of the CPN-UML
Devi Ojha said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting also condemned the government's earlier decision to
postpone local elections, according to Ojha.
</P>
<P>
The three-party coalition, led by Deuba's Nepali Congress (NC)
party, last month decided to postpone the local elections till
after the introduction of new decentralization acts, which are
expected to give more autonomy to local administration bodies.
</P>
<P>
The on-going winter session of the lower house is also expected
to discuss and approve some important bills including those on
decentralization.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Deuba is scheduled to table a confidence motion
for his government Thursday at the house session as the coalition
had been reduced to a minority status by an opposition challenge
last December.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the government would obtain the vote of
confidence with a not-so-comfortable majority in the 205-seat
lower house where the opposition party holds 90 seats.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Speed up State-owned Enterprise Equitization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The government should speed up the
process of selling shares in state-owned enterprises to raise more
money for investment and improve the profits of the companies
involved, a senior official of the Communist Party of Vietnam
(CPV) said today.
</P>
<P>
The process, known as equitization in Vietnam, remains a
crucial task in the country's current "renovation," Nguyen Tan
Dung, a member of the Standing Board of the CPV Politburo and
chief of the Economic Commission of the CPV Central Committee,
said in an article in the Communist Review magazine.
</P>
<P>
He said equitization would increase the efficiency of the
public sector and ensure its leading role in Vietnam's economy.
</P>
<P>
Two or three businesses should be equitized under each
ministry, in each sector or region in 1997-98 to pave the way for
vigorous equitization in subsequent years, Dung said in the
article.
</P>
<P>
But he said equitization did not mean privatization. The
process is aimed at mobilizing more money for investment and
helping businesses raise profits for the government - rather than
for individuals.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam decided to equitize a number of state-owned enterprises
after the country embarked on its economic reform program, known
as "renovation," to create a market economy.
</P>
<P>
In the past three years, 10 state-owned enterprises have been
equitized, with the state retaining a stake of between 18 and 30
percent, employees holding 33-50 percent, and others, 20-40
percent.
</P>
<P>
Dung said since they were equitized, these businesses have
improved their overall performance and employees have particularly
benefited.
</P>
<P>
In addition, state control over these enterprises has improved,
more employment has been created and the role of employees in
management and inspection has been increased, Dung said.
</P>
<P>
But he said there were still too few companies lining up for
equitization, a lack of legal documentation and procedures about
equitization. The government should rectify this and give
preferential treatment to newly-equitized enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Promotes Software Industry Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Board of Investment (BOI) of
Thailand today announced that the government will give promotional
privileges to the development of the software industry.
</P>
<P>
Staporn Kavitanon, secretary general of the BOI, which is
chaired by Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh, said the BOI
considered that the software industry is of strategic importance
to the future of Thailand's economy due to its role in supporting

<P>
The privileges will include exemption from import duty on
machinery and an eight-year corporate income tax holiday,
regardless of location, according to a BOI press release today.

increase the industry's competitiveness with neighboring
countries, to prepare for the rapid growth of the domestic market,
and to facilitate production for export.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's software market is projected to triple to 9 billion
baht, or 270 million US dollars, by 1999,
</P>
<P>
Software projects, such as software development, software
production, software adjustment and maintenance systems,
multimedia software production and data entry services (including
accounting, graphics, photographs, voice data, or software
documentation excluding printing.)
</P>
<P>
Software industrial parks will also be eligible for special
privileges if they use high-speed fiber optic main communications
system for the entire park, and high-speed lines for domestic and
international communications.

<HEADLINE> CPP, Funcinpec Patching up Strained Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's co-prime ministers
today had an informal luncheon together in a sign of patching up
the deteriorating relations between the two partners in the
current coalition.
</P>
<P>
Second Prime Minister Hun Sen told reporters after their
luncheon just outside the capital that "both prime ministers have
committed themselves to returning to the past," referring to the
years from 1993 to 1995 when his Cambodian People's Party and the
Funcinpec Party led by First Prime Minister Norodom Ranariddh
cooperated in the drive for national reconciliation and
reconstruction following the U.N.-monitored elections.
</P>
<P>
The luncheon, following a meeting of the council of ministers
and attended by all its participants, seemed to be designed to
create good atmosphere favorable to restoring the partnership
between the two parties.
</P>
<P>
The relationship between the two parties began to deteriorate
early last year when the Funcinpec voiced at their congress the
demand for power-sharing at all government levels and the
worsening of their relations climaxed at the bloodshed conflict
last month in Battambang province between soldiers loyal to the
two parties respectively.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached at the High command meeting last week on
a joint commission solving the Battambang conflict and reviewing
the commune elections law have stepped up the momentum to improve
relations between the two parties.

<HEADLINE> Philippine PC Sales Increase in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The total value of personal
computer sales in the Philippines grew by 35 percent last year to
314.28 million U.S. dollars from 232.69 million dollars in 1995,
according to a latest study by the International Data Corp. (IDC)
Phils.
</P>
<P>
The study by the information technology market research firm
showed that unit sales were up slightly, with 187,768 personal
computers of all types sold last year.
</P>
<P>
IDC Phils. General Manager Rommel Carlos said in the study that
the country's PC sales growth rate was the highest among the ASEAN
members.
</P>
<P>
However, the country was placed last (excluding Brunei) in
terms of real sales value.
</P>
<P>
PCs based on Intel Pentium processors also took the lion's
share of PCs sold last year, amounting to 140,098 units.
</P>
<P>
Most of the PCs sold were also desktops as 165,608 desktop PCs
valued at 251.7 million dollars were sold last year, the study
said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, up to 16,357 portable or notebook PCs were
shipped and they were valued at 37.79 million dollars, it said.
</P>
<P>
The brisk sale of notebooks could be attributed to the adoption
of portable PCs as mainstream business computing machines.
</P>
<P>
PC server sales were valued at 24.79 million dollars, with
5,803 units sold.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Map Up Better Tool in Analyzing Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government is
mapping up a better tool that will enable economic planners to
project more accurately the impact particularly of wage and oil
price adjustments in the overall inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
The new "input-output" table will be based on the new structure
of the economy, Socioeconomic Planning Secretary Cielito Habito
said today in an interview with the Philippine News Agency.
</P>
<P>
The current paradigm the country used is based on the 1988
structure of the economy. Under such a scheme, economic planners
tend to overestimate the impact of adjustments, particularly wage
and oil prices, Habito said.
</P>
<P>
He said liberalization had resulted in substantial reform in
the economy and the impact of petroleum was no longer as strong as
the old structure would have provided.
</P>
<P>
Since 1988 when more structural change in the economy
transpired, the psychological impact of such adjustments has been
severely moderated.
</P>
<P>
The National Statistical Coordination Board is now devising a
more updated input-output table based on the country's current
economic structure and incorporate all the economic programs and
policies being undertaken by the government, according to Habito.

<HEADLINE> Qian Stresses Tibet's Role in Anti-Separatism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said in Beijing today that Tibet has a significant
status in protecting national security and fighting against
separatism.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of all deputies from the Tibet Autonomous Region
to the Eighth National People's Congress, which is in its fifth
session in Beijing, Qian said that the region has scored marked
achievements in economic development, reforms, and opening to the
outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional culture has been well protected in Tibet, which
also enjoys social stability. The attacks and slanders hurled by
some Western media are completely groundless," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that recently some Western newspapers alleged that
culture and traditions in Tibet had been sabotaged, and that
industrial development had disturbed Tibetan people's peaceful
life.
</P>
<P>
"Those who made such allegations should come to Tibet for a
look by themselves," he suggested.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tibetan culture, including religious belief,
spoken and written language, culture, arts and literature, and
cultural relics and historic sites, is under good protection,
while the autonomous region enjoys economic prosperity and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
"International anti-China forces often used the Tibet issue and
Dalai Lama as their tools," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore Tibet, as an important frontier defence in the
southwestern part of our country, has a significant role in the
struggle of safeguarding the motherland and opposing separatism,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, he noted, China has maintained peace and stability
in its relations with neighboring countries, and trade is active
in quite a number of border areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have also improved relations with India, which is not only
in the interest of both countries, but also conducive to the
reform and opening up in Tibet," he added.
</P>
<P>
He finally expressed his conviction that with powerful backing
of the central authorities, Tibet will make greater progress in
the maintenance of stability and unity, economic development, and
reform and opening-up.

</P>
<P>
Tanzania and Japan have agreed to strengthen their cooperation
in such key areas as agriculture, small-scale industries, basic

</P>
<P>
Japan has been offering aid to Tanzania in the form of loans,

<TEXT>

<HEADLINE> College Grads in China Face Unbalanced Job Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Some 900,000 college students will
have to deal with a topsy-turvy market when they try to find jobs
in July.
</P>
<P>
This year, Chinese enterprises will face the largest number of
college graduates since the founding of New China in 1949,
said an official with the State Education Commission.
</P>
<P>
Some 50,000 of them are graduate students working on master's
or doctor's degrees, and the rest are graduates of two- or
four-year college courses, he said.
</P>
<P>
The supply of graduate students falls short of demand, but the
supply of two-year graduates exceeds demand, while the number of
four- or five-year graduates seems to be in balance.
</P>
<P>
College students who majored in engineering, medicine, or
teaching face a fairly easy future, but those who studied
agriculture, history, finance, and some natural sciences will have
a harder time getting jobs.
</P>
<P>
This year, the State Education Commission did not hold a
national conference to supply information on jobs to college
students. Instead, some colleges have held direct talks with
enterprises to try to help their students find jobs.
</P>
<P>
Some 860,000 college students graduated last year, about 35,000
fewer than in 1995. Most Chinese students find jobs by the end of
June, and then graduate in July with job offers at the
enterprises or institutions.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu, Mubarak Start Talks in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu held talks here today on
the peace process, particularly on a new housing project in East
Jerusalem which threatened to block the Middle East peace march.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu came exactly a week after Israel decided to set up
6,500 Jewish homes in Har Homa, a tree-covered hill in East
Jerusalem, taken by Israel in the 1967 Middle East War.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Mubarak is expected to urge Netanyahu to
shun any step on Jerusalem before reaching a relevant agreement
with the Palestinians in the final status talks due to start in
a few weeks, but the Har Homa issue has put it in doubt.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has said he fears violence would flare up because of
Israel's new construction plan in East Jerusalem, which the
Palestinians want to have as the capital of a Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
But the president said he hopes to convince Netanyahu of the
risks involved in the settlement-construction process and its
adverse effect on the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to exchange views and make him aware of what
could happen if the process reached a collapse," he said Monday.
</P>
<P>
"As to what we can do (if we fail to convince him), will we
declare war? No, nobody wants war, we are talking with Israel. So
I will explain what the consequences will be in the near future,"
he affirmed.
</P>
<P>
Viewed as an Israeli bid to tighten grip on the third holiest
city of Islam, the Har Homa plan already sparked wide-spread
Palestinian demonstrations and worldwide criticism.
</P>
<P>
Despite Mubarak's assurances that there is no problem between
Israel and Egypt and he only wants to create dialogue with Israel,
the Palestinian National Authority, Jordan and Egypt have set a
two-week deadline for Israel to cancel the settlement plan.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, who has an different concept of peace with the
Palestinians, has defended the project as a move to alleviate a
shortage of housing for Arabs and Jews in the city.
</P>
<P>
Instead of backing down on Har Homa, the Israeli leader, on the
eve of his visit to Cairo, warned that a Palestinian state at this
stage will destroy the whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
Though Netanyahu might be sensible enough to consult Mubarak on
the issue, a change of mind seems out of the question.
</P>
<P>
Besides Jerusalem, the meeting is also expected to deal with
the Syrian-Israeli peace talks, frozen for 12 months. Syria
insisted on the full return of the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau captured by Israel in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Israel rejected the position and said it is willing to discuss
partial withdrawal with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is expected to urge Netanyahu to come up with a new
formula to persuade Syria to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The meeting with Netanyahu precedes Mubarak's March 10 trip to
Washington, which would also deal with the Mideast peace process,
especially Jerusalem and resumption of the Israeli-Syrian peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the peace process, is the first Arab
country to make peace with Israel, in 1979, but ties remain cool
between them.
</P>
<P>
At a time, Israel accused Egypt of hamstringing the
Palestinians on reaching the Hebron agreement and tried to exclude
Egypt from mediation.

<HEADLINE> Legislator Calls for Preservation of Forests at River Origin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese legislator has called
for utmost attention to be paid to the preservation of forests at the
origin of the Yangtze River, the longest in China.
</P>
<P>
Chen Yaoren, a deputy from Gansu who is attending the ongoing
session of the National People's Congress (NPC), warned that soil
erosion in the Bailongjiang region may turn the Yangtze into a
second Yellow River, China's second longest, whose name derives
from its color as a result of the large amounts of soil it
carries to the sea.
</P>
<P>
The Bailongjiang forest region, at the juncture of the three
provinces of Gansu, Sichuan and Shaanxi and in an area where both
rivers originate, include the nature reserve for the precious
giant panda and the pristine Jiuzhaigou scenic zone.
</P>
<P>
Chen, vice director of the Gansu provincial forestry
department, suggested that the state allocate in the 1997-2000
period ten million yuan annually as a special fund to help
preserve the forests.
</P>
<P>
Chen, who spent 27 years working in this biggest timber
production base in northwest China and one of the eight major
forestry regions in the country, said that, given shrinking forest
resources in the area, according to a State Council decision,
annual amount of logging there has been cut by one third to
200,000 cu m since 1978.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, reduced logging has meant reduced work, and
the life of the 50,000 workers and their dependents has been
affected.
</P>
<P>
Chen suggested that the special fund be used to start new
businesses offering jobs for one fourth of the forest workers. The
function of the area administration, he said, will be shifted to
forest protection, afforestation and forest management.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed that the Bailongjiang forest region be
incorporated into the Yangtze River Shelter-Forest Project to
improve the environment at the upper reaches of the river and
maintain a clean origin for the Yangtze and Yellow rivers.

<HEADLINE> OPEC to Face Challenge From Non-OPEC Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 5 (Xinhua) - The global oil production is
expected to soar from the current 5 million barrels per day (bpd)
to 8 million bpd over the next decade, posing serious challenge
to the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC).
</P>
<P>
During the fifth annual Middle East Petroleum and Gas
Conference which concluded here Tuesday, international oil
industry sources said the increase, which is mainly contributed
by the non-OPEC producers, will impose big pressure on
production-limited OPEC countries.
</P>
<P>
OPEC producers in the Gulf is likely to keep their current
level of some 26 million bpd in the next ten years in order to
sustain their present prices, while non-OPEC countries see no
such limitation and they can increase their production freely,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, non-OPEC production reached some 43 million bpd,
according to recent forecasts by the International Energy
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The forecast also showed non-OPEC production estimated for
1997 will be over 45 million bpd, or about 1.75 times the 26
million bpd of OPEC production for the same period.
</P>
<P>
Driving the increase in non-OPEC production is a greater level
of exploration and production (E&AMP;P) investment in non-OPEC countries,
the sources said.
</P>
<P>
During the past five years, E&AMP;P investment in non-OPEC
countries is estimated to stand at over 200 billion U.S. dollars,
while E&AMP;P investment in OPEC countries was less than 45 billion
dollars for the same period, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Innovations in technology also allowed non-OPEC countries to
increase their oil production through lowering production costs
and expanding their geographic and geologic horizons.
</P>
<P>
Recent innovations such as horizontal drilling, floating
production systems and a host deep water technologies has cut
down costs of exploration, development and production, and in
regions where oil industry has been regarded as unprofitable is
turning profitable now, the sources said.

<HEADLINE> Qian Stresses Tibet's Role in Anti-Separatism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said in Beijing today that Tibet has a significant
status in protecting national security and fighting against
separatism.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting of all deputies from the Tibet Autonomous Region
to the Eighth National People's Congress, which is in its fifth
session in Beijing, Qian said that the region has scored marked
achievements in economic development, reforms, and opening to
the outside world.
</P>
<P>
"Traditional culture has been well protected in Tibet, which
also enjoys social stability. The attacks and slanders hurled some
Western media are completely groundless," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that recently some Western newspapers alleged that
culture and traditions in Tibet had been sabotaged, and that
industrial development had disturbed Tibetan people's peaceful
life.
</P>
<P>
"Those who made such allegations should come to Tibet for a
look by themselves," he suggested.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Tibetan culture, including religious belief,
spoken and written language, culture, arts and literature, and
cultural relics and historic sites, is under good protection,
while the autonomous region enjoys economic prosperity and social
stability.
</P>
<P>
"International anti-China forces often used the Tibet issue
and Dalai Lama as their tools," he pointed out.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore Tibet, as an important frontier defence in the
southwestern part of our country, has a significant role in
the struggle of safeguarding the motherland and opposing
separatism," he added.
</P>
<P>
At present, he noted, China has maintained peace and
stability in its relations with neighboring countries, and trade
is active in quite a number of border areas.
</P>
<P>
"We have also improved relations with India, which is not
only in the interest of both countries, but also conducive to
the reform and opening up in Tibet," he added.
</P>
<P>
He finally expressed his conviction that with powerful backing
of the central authorities, Tibet will make greater progress in
the maintenance of stability and unity, economic development, and
reform and opening-up.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Rice Output Up: FAO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian rice output for 1996/97
is estimated at 3.39 million tons, about 2 percent above the
estimated 1995/96 production and 35 percent higher than the
average for the previous five years, according to the U.N. Food
and Agriculture Organization (FAO) here today.
</P>
<P>
An FAO and World Food Program mission visited Cambodia in
January this year to estimate the 1996/97 wet season rice harvest,
forecast the 1996/97 dry season rice production and evaluate the
national cereal outlook for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia's total availability of rice for 1997 is estimated at
2.12 million tons while its requirement of rice for human
consumption, seed and feed is about 1.933 million tons, thus
leaving a surplus of 127,000 tons, the FAO said in a press
release.
</P>
<P>
1997 is the second consecutive year in which the country will
have a rice surplus after many years.
</P>
<P>
The mission concluded that Cambodia is definitely making
structural progress in food production, although it has not fully
overcome its crucial problem of food shortage.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program estimated that no less than 265 communes
still require food aid, about 19 percent of all communes in the 18
main rice-growing provinces.
</P>
<P>
The mission stressed the country's need for a better irrigation
system and water control and for more investment in
infrastructure, especially rural roads.

<HEADLINE> Farmer Digs Out White Pottery of Tang Dynasty in Backyard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Yinqi, a farmer in a
small village in north China, never expected to dig up a treasure
trove of thousand-year-old white pottery while working in his
backyard.
</P>
<P>
The recent find, in Dongfengsi Village, Zhaoxian County in
Hebei Province, consists of 46 pieces of pottery in white or other
colors. A complete human skeleton was also found in the tomb, some
two meters underground.
</P>
<P>
The tomb was dated around the year 688 during the Tang Dynasty.
</P>
<P>
One-third of the sacrificial objects are pottery figures
dressed as officials, warriors, ethnic people, maids or women
musicians. They range from 40 to 50 cm in height.
</P>
<P>
Included are also animal figures which serve to guard the tomb,
a pottery pig, lion, camel, ox, horse, fish, sheep, dog and
household objects such as a pottery cart, grind and water
container.
</P>
<P>
Experts commented that the most representative of the objects
is a 59-cm tall pottery warrior standing on a oblong base. He is
wearing a helmet, his mouth is open and his eyes are wide, he has
a thick mustache and looks noble. His left arm bends in front of
his chest, and his hand is clenched. His right hand holds a
serpent whose head touchs the ground.
</P>
<P>
The facial expression and posture of the warrior demonstrate
the power of the Tang army, experts said.
</P>
<P>
The author of the pottery was found to be the same artist who
created the sacrificial objects in two tombs found earlier in the
city of Xintai in the province. Several similar one-chamber brick
tombs have been found in the province.

<HEADLINE> Kohl Meets U.S. Defence Secretary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Helmut Kohl met
here today with visiting U.S. Defence Secretary William Cohen,
praising the relations between Germany and the United States as
"outstanding."
</P>
<P>
Cohen is currently on his first trip abroad after becoming U.S.
defence chief. He is due to end his two-day stay in Germany today
after visiting U.S. military bases in southern Germany and meeting
U.S. military commanders in Stuttgart.
</P>
<P>
Cohen held talks Tuesday with his German counterpart Volker
Ruehe. According to him, it was possible that Washington might
eventually give up or share the command of southern NATO forces
with a European officer after several years -- an issue over which
the U.S. and France have been fighting over years.
</P>
<P>
In response to a German tentative, the new U.S. defence chief
said the U.S. was willing to review the matter in five, six or
seven years, while stressing that the command might still remain
in U.S. hands.
</P>
<P>
Cohen on Tuesday also affirmed the withdrawal of
U.S. peacekeeping troops in Bosnia in June, 1998 as planned. He
met on Monday in Pentagon with British Defence Secretary Michael
Portillo, who required the U.S. to remain in Bosnia, sharing with
its NATO allies in Europe the burden of peacekeeping there.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday, Cohen is expected to visit the air force base at
Aviano, Sicily, Tuzla in Bosnia and to meet with Italian Defence
Minister Beniamino Andreatta in Rome. He will end his first
foreign tour Friday after talks with NATO Secretary-General Javier
Solana in Brussels.

<P>
HAIKOU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- An industrial corridor has taken
shape in the west part of Hainan, the largest island province in
China, after a massive construction effort that has lasted for
years.
</P>
<P>
West Hainan was an underdeveloped area until focus was centered
on the development of its abundant natural resources.
</P>
<P>
By taking advantage of offshore natural gas nearby, the Hainan
Natural Gas Chemical Fertilizer Plant has invested 2.5 billion
yuan (about 301 million US dollars) in setting up a fertilizer
plant.
</P>
<P>
The newly-completed plant is capable of producing 300,000 tons
of synthetic ammonia and 520,000 tons of urea annually. The plant,
which is the country's first producer of large granulated urea,
will generate an output value of one billion yuan per year.
</P>
<P>
By processing mangos and 30 other fruits on the island, the
Yefeng (Coconut Wind) company, jointly invested by Chinese and
foreign businessmen, has become a large enterprise group with an
annual output value of three billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The Yangpu Economic Development Zone has invested 5.3 billion
yuan in setting up a 315,500-kw power plant and a power grid,
completing construction of 50 km long highways and underground
facilities, and leveling 18 square kilometers of land.
</P>
<P>
Recently, the zone made a breakthrough in inviting business for
its industrial projects; a group of chemical plants, with an
investment of nearly 10 billion yuan, are to be launched soon.
</P>
<P>
Since the province decided to set up more heavy industries in
the west and build an industrial corridor, the area's economy has
gained strong momentum.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the output value of six counties and cities in the
west and the Yangpu Economic Development Zone grew by 2.4 billion
yuan. The growth rates of Danzhou, Chengmai and Dongfang
respectively hit 13.8 percent, 22.5 percent and 28.4 percent.

<HEADLINE> Official: 3.7 Million Child Laborers in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- There are 3.7 million child
laborers in the Philippines and 60 percent of them are exposed to
hazardous work and activities, a Philippine official said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has worked out strategies to tackle
the issue, Lina Laigo, social welfare and development secretary,
was quoted by the Philippine News Agency today as saying.
</P>
<P>
Laigo attributed the increase in child laborers to the lack of
awareness and tolerance, indifference and cultural attitudes aside
 from poverty.
</P>
<P>
She said the authorities have employed a quick action team for
detecting, monitoring and rescuing children in "bonded labor and
hazardous work" in coordination with a national police team.
</P>
<P>
Other measures taken by the government include the setting up
of child watch hotlines to address the child labor issue, said the
secretary.
</P>
<P>
Laigo also called for regional and international cooperation to
hasten the elimination of the most intolerable forms of child
labor in the Philippines and the rest of the world.

<HEADLINE> Lassa Fever Kills Nine in Eastern Sierra Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Nine people died of lassa
fever in eastern Sierra Leone between December and February, a
Health Ministry official told Xinhua today in a telephone
interview.
</P>
<P>
Alentine Kawa, a health education officer, said 59 people,
admitted at the Kenema Government Hospital, are currently
seriously ill.
</P>
<P>
"There is evidence of more people suffering from the disease,
but they are living in outlying villages," he said.
</P>
<P>
The situation would have worsened, added Kawa.
</P>
<P>
However, the medical authorities in Freetown said the
situation "is not very alarming and it could be contained."
</P>
<P>
"It is important to avoid coming in contact with patients who
display the signs and symptoms because the disease is transmitted
through a patient's vomit or other fluids from his body," said a
bulletin released by the Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
A lassa fever research center is based in Guinea bordering on
Sierra Leone where all related cases are handled in collaboration
with personnel from the World Health Organization and the center
for disease control in Atlantan Georgia in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Lassa fever is a kind of epidemic caused by Lassa virus. The
disease was first found in Lassa Village in Nigeria. enditem

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Superior Council of Magistrature, which was appointed by
President Jacques Chirac to nominate magistrates, said in a report
that half of its proposals presented last year to the president
and the ministry of justice were not accepted. This put into
question the willingness of President Chirac and the Minister of

France.

Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Faced with violent reaction from unions over his social
readjustment program, the president of the Renault automaker Louis
Schweitzer said on Tuesday that although the decision to close
Renault's Vilvoorde assembly plant in Belgium and lay off 2,764
workers in France is "grave and sad," it was examined "carefully
in all its justifications to make sure that it was an
incontestable strategic and economic plan."

<HEADLINE> Peace-keepers Worry About Revenge Killings in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- As life returns to normal in
Liberia and hundreds of displaced and exiled citizens back home
daily after the successful disarmament, revenge killings of
former faction fighters have aroused international concern.
</P>
<P>
According to a report reaching here today, at least six former
fighters were hacked to death by angry villagers who accused them
of mass killings and harassment during the civil war, which
claimed the lives of more than 150,000 people in the West African
country.
</P>
<P>
In Monrovia, capital of Liberia, Commander Major-General
Victor Malu of the West African Peace-Keeping Force (ECOMOG) said
on Tuesday reports reaching ECOMOG had indicated that the said
citizens were going about, armed with cutlasses and sticks in the
name of vigilante groups, waylaying known former fighters and in
some cases inflicting bodily injuries on them.
</P>
<P>
Such incidents occurred especially in areas around Sass Town
and Degbeh village in Bomi and Grand Cape Mount Countries,
northwestern Liberia, the Nigerian general said.
</P>
<P>
The situation has forced the flight of hundreds of ex-fighters
to their surrounding bushes. Some are said to have arrived in
Monrovia from villages they once occupied before the disarmament
exercise.
</P>
<P>
"ECOMOG views this conduct as highly negative and completely
detrimental to its efforts to achieve a lasting reconciliation
and peace for all Liberians," said Malu.
</P>
<P>
"The chasing around and molesting of former fighters who have
been disarmed in the quest for national peace is criminal,
unethical and illegal," he warned.
</P>
<P>
The force commander urged all Liberians to imbibe a spirit of
forgiveness and reconciliation as that is the only way to speed
up the recovery of the Liberian nation from the devastation by
the civil war.
</P>
<P>
"Rather than molest disarmed fighters because of their
horrible acts in the past, such citizens concerned, and indeed
all Liberians should divert their energies into furnishing ECOMOG
with information about hidden arms so that we can recover all
unsurrendered weapons and further make the country safe for all,
especially as we embark on the process," he said.
</P>
<P>
Disarmament and demobilization of Liberia's rival factions
ended in early February this year. During the exercise, more than
30,000, or 91 percent of the factional fighters, were disarmed by
Nigerian-led ECOMOG, while some 14,156 pieces of arms, 1.65
million ammunitions and 4,369 bombs were recovered.
</P>
<P>
Currently preparations are underway for the country's general
elections scheduled for May 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
Three former Liberian rival warlords, Charles Taylor, Alhaji
Kromah and George Boley, have resigned from the ruling Council of
State to contest for the presidency in the forthcoming national
polls.
</P>
<P>
All three were former vice-chairmen of the interim government
and leaders of major warring factions.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Opposes Japan's Security Council Aim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's Republic
of Korea (DPRK) today stressed its opposition to Japan's wish to
become a permanent member of the United Nation's Security Council.
</P>
<P>
An article, published in the official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun,
said Japanese leaders recently advocated their so-called Japanese
"values" and "philosophy," claiming they would guide the world
through the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
If Japan, which had moved from being an economic power to a
military power, became a permanent member of the Security Council,
it would promote its hegemonism and power politics, and extend its
influence to the whole world, the article said.
</P>
<P>
The article also criticized Japan for creating the view of
equality with Germany on becoming a permanent member of the
Security of Council.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Germany couldn't be treated equally because they
treated the war crimes differently, it said.
</P>
<P>
So, Japan should start by admitting and compensating for its
crimes before bidding for a permanent membership in the Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The article was published as Japan launched a promotion for its
aim to become a permanent member.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The British Civil Aviation
Authority (BCAA) has banned aircraft owned by the Nigeria Airways
from flying to London, the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ban came in the wake of alleged
irregularities in the insurance papers of the national carriers
of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
It said the BCAA has earlier asked the Nigeria Airways to seek
clarifications on the insurance cover for its fleet.
</P>
<P>
However, General Manager of Corporate Affairs of the Nigeria
Airway Chris Aligbe said that the airline will still be flying
its Lagos-London routes regularly by leasing aircraft, as the ban
affected only aircraft it owns, not its flying right.
</P>
<P>
He said that the management of the airline is already working with
the National Insurance Corporation of Nigeria (NICON) to resolve the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The report said NICON has last month withdrawn its insurance
cover from the airline over default in premium payment.
</P>
<P>
Managing Director of the airline Peter Gana said at a press
conference two weeks ago that Nigeria Airways has been meeting
its insurance obligations.

<HEADLINE> China's Natural Protection Wins Praise From Overseas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE (Hebei), March 5 (Xinhua) -- Delegates of overseas
environmental protection agencies today praised the achievements
China has scored in the field at the ongoing International
Workshop on Wetlands and Water-Bird Conservation held in coastal
Beidaihe, north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
Douglas Hykle, from the United Nations Environment Program,
said that China has contributed significantly to the global
natural protection work in the past decade, playing an influential
role in shouldering international responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"I've been to China seven times, and find that the country's
public awareness of natural protection has improved," said Faizal
Parish, executive director of Wetlands International Asia Pacific.
</P>
<P>
He said it's amazing that China has increased the number of its
natural reserves to nearly 800 in less than 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Two things have impressed me most," he noted. "One is that
China closed a large number of small-sized paper mills with
serious pollution problems last year, and the other is that so
many government officials in the country attended this symposium."
</P>
<P>
Faizal told Xinhua News Agency that wetlands protection is
still an unfamiliar practice in many countries, but China realized
its importance several years ago.
</P>
<P>
"In this field, China is at the forefront," he said.
</P>
<P>
Delegates from the World Wide Fund For Nature Hong Kong said
that they are encouraged by the fact that China has spent a large
sums on protecting nature, which clearly illustrates the country's
dedication to the work.
</P>
<P>
Chen Jianwei, an official with the Chinese Ministry of
Forestry, said that planting trees and caring for birds are
popular hobbies in the country.
</P>
<P>
China is drafting its first desert law, which will redouble the
country's efforts to protect nature, Chen said.

HONG KONG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's leading bus
companies have placed an 880-million-HK-dollar (113 million US
dollars) order for modern buses and want to see them well into the
next century, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
On a shopping spree were Kowloon Motor Bus CO, Citybus and
China Motor Bus CO, which have ordered a total of 421 double-deck
buses from Trinity Holdings, a British specialist vehicle group
that has supplied many of the buses now operating in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Most of the buses are intended for the new route to the Chek
Lap Kok new airport and are expected to be ready for service in 12
months.
</P>
<P>
Some 180 are three-axle, double-deck buses, but about 241 are
the new Trident "easy access" double-deckers, which would be the
first double-deckers of this type to be used anywhere in the
world.
</P>
<P>
The Tridents will have no steps or ramps, and instead run at
the same level as the curb.

<HEADLINE> R&AMP;D Contribution to GDP Still Low in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Research and Development
(R&AMP;D) contribution to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in Malaysia is
still low, science adviser in the Prime Minister's Department Omar
Abdul Rahman said today.
</P>
<P>
The overall national R&AMP;D effort is only around 0.8 percent of
GDP, against the 1.5 percent targeted under the Sixth Malaysia
Plan (1991- 1995), he said at an R&AMP;D symposium here.
</P>
<P>
He said the targeted 25 percent contribution by the private
sector to the nation's R&AMP;D effort has also not been achieved.
</P>
<P>
Hence, there is an increasing need to create more smart
partnerships between the public and private sectors as well as
local and foreign companies to intensify R&AMP;D efforts towards
promoting the growth of technology-based industries in Malaysia,
he said.
</P>
<P>
He regretted that "the R&AMP;D awareness is also not there despite
the increasing public sector allocation to R&AMP;D -- 400 million
ringgit (about 160 million U.S. dollars) under the 5th Malaysia
Plan (1986-1990), 600 million ringgit (about 240 million dollars)
under the 6th Malaysia Plan and 1 billion ringgit (about 400
million dollars) under the 7th Malaysia Plan (1996-2000)."
</P>

According to the Malaysian Business Trends Survey Report 1996
published by the Malaysian Institute of Management (MIM), 30
percent of 166 respondents had no R&AMP;D activities at all while the
rest spent less than 1.9 percent on R&AMP;D.
</P>
<P>
This is far behind when compared with foreign multi-national
corporations which spend no less than 10 percent of their total
annual company expenditure for R&AMP;D.
</P>
<P>
Omar said through mastery of technology will the country
control its own destiny in the face of the inevitable competitive
forces from globalization.
</P>
<P>
Information technology (IT) could enhance the country's Total
Factor Productivity (TFP), the measure for productivity driven
growth (as opposed to input-driven growth), which reflects
technological content of the productive sectors, he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's TFP was also low at 16 percent of the total GDP
growth during the period 1960-1990 and under the 7th Malaysia Plan
the country has a target TFP of 41 percent, according to the
adviser.
</P>
<P>
Omar said the absorption of technology management by the public
and private sectors and foreign companies could help the promoted
smart partnerships to succeed as it can smoothen technology
transfer and technology co-development.
</P>
<P>
He called on the small- and medium-scale industries (SMIs) to
start their R&AMP;D programs now by sourcing financing from the 1
billion ringgit (400 million dollars) fund under the
Intensification of Research in Priority Areas and Microelectronics
Institute of Malaysia allocations.
</P>
<P>
The related programs involving the public and private sectors
which are being promoted include setting up R&AMP;D companies,
cooperative research centers, industry-specific research
institutes, R&AMP;D syndication and technological universities.

<HEADLINE> Nuclear Power Plant Repaired in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indian scientists claimed to
have developed the technology required to repair nuclear power
plants and increase their life span by 15 years, The Times of
India reported today.
</P>
<P>
Scientists at the Rajasthan Atomic Power Project in India's
Rajasthan State said they have been successful in repairing one of
the power-generating units which was shut down three years ago.
</P>
<P>
They said the unit would start generating power again by April.
</P>
<P>
The first unit of the atomic power station was closed down in
1994 because of a leakage in the coolant tubes of its reactor,
resulting in the leakage of heavy water and helium gas.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear scientists from some Western countries had suggested
that the plant be closed down and "buried" as it was impossible to
repair the tubes.
</P>
<P>
They had claimed that any attempt to repair them would cost
millions of dollars with no guarantee of success.
</P>
<P>
Despite this, the Indian scientists proceeded to change six of
the eight damaged coolant tubes at a cost of about 200 million
rupees (about 5.7 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The scientists assessed the damage caused to the tubes by
inserting a remote-control instrument and studied possible
remedial measures.
</P>
<P>
A specially-designed gasket was inserted into the coolant
chambers using robots, enabling the scientists to plug the leakage
in the tubes.

<P>
MACAO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Macao International Airport
transported 150,772 passengers in February, a record number since
the airport went into operation in November 1995, the Macao
International Airport Company (CAM) said today.
</P>
<P>
A press release from the CAM said the figure was boosted by
holiday traffic and additional chartered flights over the Chinese
Lunar New Year period.
</P>
<P>
In addition, airlines logged extra flights and in many cases
used higher capacity aircraft to meet the demand of increasing
passengers.
</P>
<P>
The airport carried a total of 268,745 passengers between
January and February, compared to 97,050 passengers during the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The total number of passengers who used the airport stood at
1,600,000. That "is well ahead of our expectations and reflects
the growing awareness of the airport and its convenience to
passengers and shippers," said Joao Sousa Moreira, chairman of the
board of directors of the CAM.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cargo shipment of the airport reached 4,700 tons in
the first two months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The airport will make effective its spring flight schedule from
April 1. The new schedule will add 50 weekly flights to previous
flights. The added flights include those between Macao and
Bangkok, Taiwan, and China's mainland.

<HEADLINE> Australia Rejects E.U. Greenhouse Gas Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Australian Foreign Minister
Alexander Downer today criticized a European Union (E.U.) plan to
reduce global greenhouse gas emissions for not treating all
countries equally.
</P>
<P>
Downer said while answering a question in the parliament that
the E.U. plan allows individual European nations flexibility in
meeting the target by 2010 but does not offer the same flexibility
to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Australia is resisting binding targets for reducing greenhouse
gas emissions being pushed by Europe and the United States in
international climate change talks.
</P>
<P>
It argues that it will be asked to bear a disproportionate
share of the cost of combating global warming because it is a
major carbon-based energy exporter.
</P>
<P>
Downer told the parliament that the European plan does offer
flexibility for the development needs of individual countries, but
only in Europe. It allows Portugal to increase greenhouse
emissions by 40 percent, Greece by 30 percent and Spain by 17
percent while Australia would be required to conform to the
15-percent overall target.
</P>
<P>
"The 15-percent target is unrealistic and we see it as more of
a negotiating tactic by the European Union. The proposal is
frankly unworkable because it doesn't provide a sound framework
for long-term cooperative arrangements to address the climate
change issue," he added.

JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia posted an inflation rate
of 1.05 percent in February, the lowest in the same periods of the

with the 1.05 percent inflation rate in February, inflation rate
in the 1996-97 fiscal year reached 5.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Singapore Steps Up Efforts to Become International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Singapore government is
stepping up its efforts to develop the country into an
International Exhibition City by the year 2000, as it is embarking
on a two-year program to strengthen the software component of its
exhibition management services industry.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore Trade Development Board (TDB) said today that
this program was integral to realize the national vision of
developing Singapore as an international exhibition city by the
year 2000.
</P>
<P>
For Singapore to enhance the software element of the exhibition
management services sector, the TDB noted that it will need the
presence of high quality mega trade fairs which can rival other
competing shows in the region and command international
participation.
</P>
<P>
"This aspect is crucial in Singapore's ability to pull in
international trade buyers and sellers to its shores," it said.
</P>
<P>
To this end, the TDB said strategic efforts should be made in
creating a framework for public-private sector partnership,
raising international awareness, setting internationally accepted
performance standards for trade fairs in Singapore, and enhancing
the image of Singapore exhibition management services companies
and trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
It said that it is also important to enhance industry
development and support, and broaden the scope of exhibition
management services companies and trade fairs.
</P>
<P>
Singapore is now host to many international trade shows, as 18
out of the 46 Asian trade shows recognized by the Union des Foires
International (UFI) are currently held in Singapore, the TDB said.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Unacceptably High in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Although serious crime rates
have dropped in nine out of 20 categories last year over 1995,
the crime levels in South Africa remain unacceptably high,
according to a quarterly crime statistics issued today.
</P>
<P>
Categories which saw a decrease included murder, car
hijacking, drug-related offenses and aggravated robbery, while
four kinds of crimes, including rape and serious assault,
increased.
</P>
<P>
Murders in the country fell to 61.1 per 100,000 last year
against 64.6 in 1995 and 66.6 in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi attributed this
decline to the success of police task groups which have targeted
organized political violence.
</P>
<P>
Car hijackings were down by 18.6 percent in Gauteng Province,
where three quarters of the hijackings occurred, and was the only
province in which comparable statistics were available.
</P>
<P>
Robbery with aggravating circumstances dropped from 210.8
cases per 100,000 in 1994 to 159.2 last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, fraud, forgery, embezzlement, mal-appropriation and
other commercial crimes remained virtually stable at 75.3 cases
per 100,000.
</P>
<P>
However, reported rapes were increased from 105.3 per 100,000 in
1994 to 115.2 in 1995 and 119.5 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Presenting the statistics in Pretoria Tuesday night, Mufamadi
said he was pleased with the stabilizing or declining trend in
most serious crime categories, but worried about the unacceptably
high crime rates.

JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Finance Minister
Nangolo Mbumba was expected to focus on the country's medium-term
economic strategy when he unveils the government's 1997/98 budget
today in Windhoek, the capital of Namibia.
</P>
<P>
A local daily Business Day today quoted a senior economist as
saying that Mbumba would keep Namibia on track to achieve its
three percent deficit target by the year of 2000.
</P>
<P>
Emile van Zyl, an economist of Bank Windhoek, said he expected
the budget deficit to reduce to 4.5 percent of gross domestic
product (GDP), compared with an estimated 4.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Van Zyl believed that the Finance Minister would direct most
public expenditure toward education, job creation and poverty
alleviation, major goals in Namibia's first national development
plan.
</P>
<P>
He said the public sector wage bill, one of the largest
expenditure items in the past, presented the government with a
difficult problem.
</P>
<P>
Namibia reportedly achieved an approximately three percent
growth rate in 1996 due to good rains the country had received
last year after long-period drought.

<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Some members of the Eighth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) aired their views on topics of general concern
at the second plenary meeting of its annual session here today.
</P>
<P>
Present at the meeting were CPPCC National Committee
Chairman Li Ruihuan and Vice Premier Wu Bangguo.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Wenshou, vice chairman of the CPPCC National
Committee's Subcommittee for Handling Proposals, reported on the
handling of proposals submitted by members since the last
session of the National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Wang Yuzhao, executive vice chairman of the Subcommittee on
Economy, said the problem of a shortage of capital for state-owned
enterprises must be addressed to help them overcome difficulties.
</P>
<P>
The problem has been caused by an overheated real estate market
which consumes an immense amount of fund, debt entanglements among
enterprises, an increased stockpiling of goods, and non-performing
bank loans.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhengguang, a member of the Standing Committee of the CPPCC
National Committee, suggested that economic cooperation between
Shenzhen and Hong Kong be increased, especially in urban
infrastructure and the connecting of the existing two passages, to
help maintain prosperity and stability in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jin Jian, another Standing Committee member and an executive
vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Nationalities and Religion,
called for attention to problems existing in border trade.
</P>
<P>
Tsui Tsin-tong, a Hong Kong businessman, suggested that Hong
Kong's advantages as an international economic center be preserved

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Arrives in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu arrived here today amid mounting Arab and international
furor over a new Israeli settlement plan in East Jerusalem, which
threatens to stumble the whole peace process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu came exactly a week after Israel decided to set up
6,500 Jewish homes in Gabal Abu Ghoneim, a tree-covered hill in
East Jerusalem, which was seized by Israel in the 1967 Middle East
War.
</P>
<P>
The settlement project, which the former Labor government had
delayed under pressure, has sparked Palestinian demonstrations and
worldwide denouncement.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Netanyahu has caused
anger among the Egyptians to the extent that a visit to Israel
would be wrong, unless these policies could be changed.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks between the two leaders will delve into the peace
prospects in the Middle East region in light of the worsening
conditions as a result of the Israeli housing plan.
</P>
<P>
While Netanyahu could defend the project as a move to alleviate
a shortage of housing for Arabs and Jews in the city, Mubarak is
expected to urge him to shun any step regarding Jerusalem before
reaching a relevant agreement with the Palestinians on a solution
satisfying both parties.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said Monday that he would try his utmost to dissuade
Netanyahu from following through the decision during their meeting
today.
</P>
<P>
The visit is Netanyahu's second to Egypt since he held talks
with Mubarak after assuming office last June. Since then, Mubarak
has said he would not host the Israeli leader unless the
Palestinian-Israeli talks make progress on the long-delayed
Israeli partial pullback from the West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed the Hebron withdrawal after it reached a deal
with the Palestinian national Authority on January 15. It is
committed to starting the first stage of redeployment in the rural
areas of the West Bank before March 7, a date Israel is very
likely to delay.
</P>
<P>
Besides the Palestinian-Israeli track, another topic listed
high on the meeting's agenda is the Israeli-Syrian peace talks,
frozen since last February. The two sides bicker over the fate of
the Golan Heights, a strategic plateau captured by Israel in the
1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
Egypt has blamed Israel for the stalled talks and urged
Netanyahu to come up with a new formula that would persuade Syria
to return to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, a key mediator in the peace talks, signed a peace treaty
with Israel in 1979, but the bilateral ties remain cool.

their stories about advisory activities for the Communist Party
and the government.
</P>
<P>
During the past four years, approximately 10,000 proposals have
been set forth by 92 percent of the members of the Eighth CPPCC
National Committee, which is in its annual session in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
These proposals offer prescriptions for all types of "diseases"
in China, ranging from the strengthening of macro-economic control
to the control of swine cysticercosis.
</P>
<P>
"They have covered a wide-range of topics, and also scored
satisfactory achievements," said Gu Shengzu, a CPPCC National
Committee member the China Democratic National Construction
Association, one of the country's non-Communist parties.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged that each good proposal had gone through a
process of deep pondering and meticulous designing.
</P>
<P>
Usually, proposals of the CPPCC National Committee members have
two major functions. One is to report major social problems with
great public interest and suggest ways of solution, and the other
is to offer the government advices on major issues concerning
national economy and people's livelihood.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC National Committee today commended more than 100
members as "kings of proposals" for their active and effective
involvement in China's government and political affairs.
</P>
<P>
One of them was Ye Weizhen, a member of the non-Communist China
Democratic League, who was cited for two proposals regarding the
transformation of a seriously-polluted park in downtown Beijing
and the reform of China's social pension insurance system
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Before submitting any proposals, Ye said, the CPPCC members
usually study the government work report repeatedly in order to
find an appropriate topic, and then conduct meticulous and
down-to-earth investigations.
</P>
<P>
Gu Shengzu, who heads a population center of the prestigious
Wuhan University in central China'a Hubei Province, conducted a
survey at the cost of 500,000 yuan, before he wrote a proposal on
the administration of migrant population in China's urban areas,
which later drew much attention from the central authorities.
</P>
<P>
To prepare for a motion on the strengthening of quality
education, Wang Fuzhong made trips to different types of schools
and consulted officials with the State Education Commission and
educational experts.

<HEADLINE> Proposal Submission Key Means of Political Consultation (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"A good proposal should have substantial content and a solid
basis, and write well and in good order," said member Wang Junyan
from a Hannan University in the country's southernmost province.
"But what's more important is feasibility. The proposal should
be rational and reasonable, and you can't propose anything that is
impossible to achieve in practical work."
</P>
<P>
But Member Chong Wing-king, chairman of the board of the Hong
Kong-based Yap Chau Holdings Ltd., said that there is also a kind
of "risk-taking proposals", which submitters should consider and
set forth long before others.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago, Chong put forth a proposal to call for
government attention to the reality of widening economic
differences between eastern and western China, and the proposal
won praises today.
</P>
<P>
Most proposals of the CPPCC National Committee members have
drawn due attention from government leaders and the relevant
departments, with problems they reported being solved quickly.
</P>
<P>
Some major Party and government policies and measures, such as
those on the promotion of ethical and cultural progress and the
easing of farmers' economic burden, could also be attributed
partly to proposals of the CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Sometimes, however, the acceptance of a proposal takes time. Ye
Weizhen recalled that it took her a lot of efforts to convince
local officials of the measures Ye had suggested to clean the
polluted man-made lake.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for increased attention to proposals submitted
by the CPPCC members," said Sun Fuling, vice-chairman of the CPPCC
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
Some proposals come from a single member of the CPPCC National
Committee, while some others were jointly submitted by more than
100 members, or even in the name of a party. Nevertheless, most of
the proposals originated from from experts and professors.
</P>
<P>
Member Gao Shipin noted that the reason the CPPCC could set
forth so many proposals is that the government respects the
democratic consultative system and is willing to accept and handle
the proposals. Moreover, the CPPCC members have a strong sense of
responsibility.

<P>
CAIRO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's Ambassador to France Ali

Mubarak's talks with his French counterpart Jacques Chirac, who
has been a strong supporter of the peace process.

The ambassador noted that France backs the Arab stance and
calls for establishing a just and comprehensive peace in the
region.

The European Union (EU), especially France, played a major role
in realizing a U.S.-sponsored cease-fire understanding
last April which ended a 17-day Israeli blitz on Lebanon.

state revenues dropped 0.7 percent in real terms to 25.3 billion
shekels (about 8 billion dollars) compared with the same period a

<HEADLINE> Three Gorges Project Proceeds Smoothly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's giant Three Gorges Project
is an ecology-friendly undertaking and construction of its first
phase is going slightly ahead of schedule with investment below
estimates, official sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The project, the world's largest water conservancy undertaking
on the Yangtze River, China's longest, has both positive and
negative impacts on the environment, Guo Shuyan, vice minister in
charge of the State Planning Commission and deputy director of the
State Council Three Gorges Project Construction Committee, said at
a press conference organized by the Eighth People's National
Congress, China's legislature, which has been in session since
last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"But feasibility studies have shown that advantages overweigh
disadvantages in terms of the environment," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges Project, with an estimated investment of 90
billion yuan at 1993 prices, or 203.4 billion yuan in dynamic
prices when it completes in 2009, will help replace otherwise
polluting energies used in affected areas with a pollution-free,
clean and renewable energy, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
The burning of coal to generate power causes pollution,
and coal shipment puts strains on the transportation system, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The project will also help reduce the threat of floods at the
middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River, cutting the
incidence of serious floods to once in 100 years from once in ten
years, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
"The Three Gorges Project has a very important role to play in
flood control in the Yangtze River valley," he said.
</P>
<P>
Lu Youmei, General Manager of China Yangtze Three Gorges
Project Development Corp., said that construction of the project
will not affect navigation and will instead raise the river's
navigable tonnage by a big margin.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Guo admitted the project could produce
negative effects on animals and plants. Silting may also pose a
problem, he said.
</P>
<P>
"But with proper measures, we can solve or minimize the
problems," Guo said, adding that silting will unlikely pose a
serious problem to the project itself and, taking into
consideration of all factors, the storage capacity of the
reservoir will maintain at 86 percent of its designed capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, the Three Gorges Project can be called an ecology
project... and it will make people there live and work in a safer
and better environment," he said.
</P>
<P>
On protection of cultural sites and relics in the project area,
Guo said that both the central government and local governments
are keen on it.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese central government and local governments have
organized dozens of geological surveys after the launching of the
project in 1993 and special funds have been earmarked for the
protection of sites and objects, he said, adding that finds
include one item of national level and 26 at the provincial
level.
</P>
<P>
He denied a lack of funding for protecting cultural sites and
objects, saying: "As we can afford the project, we can also afford
to protect the sites and objects."
</P>
<P>
He said that China looks forward to cooperating with other
countries with regard to the protection of sites of historical
interest and cultural relics in the project area, adding that
Canada and Japan have already expressed interest in this regard.
</P>
<P>
Guo said that to date a total of 19.1 billion yuan has been
invested in the project, including 5.97 billion yuan for
the resettlement of displaced residents.
</P>
<P>
He said that the first group of generators will begin
operational in 2003, with annual power generation expected to hit
84.7 billion kwh by 2005.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the gigantic project's first phase is slightly
ahead of schedule and investment in the phase is about four billion
yuan less than planned, Guo said.
</P>
<P>
To increase funding, the corporation has issued one billion
yuan in corporate bonds since February 28. Lu dismissed any plan
to issue bonds overseas in the near future.
</P>
<P>
He said that all debts will be repaid by the year 2012.

JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A German consortium led by
Siemens Ltd. (Israel) has won a tender to supply 9 million U.S.
dollars of equipment for the construction of the Gaza
International Airport, today's Jerusalem Post reported.
</P>
<P>
However, Israel has not yet given final approval for the
airport, a criterion that must be met before the Palestinians
can operate flights to and from the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Siemens managing director Ekkehard Koethe said that the
potential political difficulties did not affect the consortium's
decision to bid for the tender.
</P>
<P>
The consortium will supply electrical and communication
technologies for use in the terminals and security systems.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, Siemens said the Gaza Airport will be

</P>
<P>
"The whole idea of the airport is in negotiations," said
Yigal Palmor, a Foreign Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, most of the airport's three-kilometer runway has
been built inside Palestinian controlled territory, and the
terminal, on which work has begun without Israeli permission, is
supposed to straddle the Israel-Palestinian Gaza border so
Israel can control the arrivals and departures of all
passengers.
</P>
<P>
"Business is business, and when we are asked to give an
offer, we place an offer. When we are awarded a contract we take
it," Koethe said. "We cannot say what the next steps will be and
if the project will be realized."

<HEADLINE> Israel Proposing Secret Talks With Syria: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel is proposing secret
talks with Syria in order to break the protracted deadlock on the
Israeli-Syrian track of the peace process, a newspaper report said
today.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting with visiting French Foreign Minister
Herve de Charette Tuesday, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu reportedly asked him to convey a message to Syrian
President Hafez Assad that Israel is willing to hold secret
talks wherever the Syrians like.
</P>
<P>
"You can tell the Syrians that we will meet them in
Washington, Paris, or wherever they like. If they want to
meet secretly, this is fine, too," Netanyahu was quoted by
The Jerusalem Post as telling de Charette.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu urged the Syrians to abandon the view that he
was not serious about peace but only wanted to drag out
the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Arabs said that when we were negotiating on Hebron that we
wanted the talks to drag, but they were wrong. We did a Hebron
deal," Netanyahu added.
</P>
<P>
During separate talks with de Charette, Israeli Foreign
Minister David Levy reportedly mentioned the possibility that, in
order to bridge the gap with Syria, Israel could agree that
the first issue on the agenda is to reach a definition of where
the talks left off a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli-Syrian talks were suspended last March following a
series of suicide bombings in Israel. Although Israel's Likud
government, which came to power last June, has repeatedly called
for the resumption of the talks without preconditions, Syria has
rejected the calls, insisting the talks be only resumed from the
point where they left off a year ago.
</P>
<P>
It means that the talks should be resumed on the basis
of the informal understanding reached between Israel's former
Labor government and Syria, in which Israel pledged to
withdraw fully from the occupied Golan Heights in return for
Syria's agreement to sign a peace deal with Israel.
</P>
<P>
The Likud government has vowed never to relinquish its
self-proclaimed sovereignty over the Golan Heights on grounds of
protecting the safety of its water resources and northern
border. Recently, Israeli officials have indicated the
willingness to agree to a partial withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, whose country maintains good relations with
Syria, is to travel to Damascus tonight. France, seeking a
greater role in the peace process, is trying to bring the
two rivals back to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
But no breakthrough is expected from de Charette's current
mediation tour in view of the hardline message from Syria,
which was conveyed by him to Netanyahu during the Tuesday
meeting. Syria said that Damascus would not budge from
insistence that talks cannot resume unless they begin where
they left off a year ago.
</P>
<P>
The message was issued by Syrian Vice President Abdul Halim
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouk Shara, who visited Paris
last week to discuss the prospects of resuming the Israeli-Syrian
talks.

<HEADLINE> More Farmers in North China Join Old Age Pension Schemes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In north China's Tangshan,
more farmers are getting access to old age pensions, a benefit
previously enjoyed only by urban residents.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 575,300 farmers in the city's suburbs have
participated in the old age insurance system, with premiums
totaling 102.72 million yuan (12.38 million US dollars), taking
the lead in Hebei province.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years, Tangshan, with a population of 1.5
million, has paid more attention to social security in rural
areas, encouraging farmers to buy old-age policies. Many farmers
no longer depend on their children for financial support, but live
on pensions when they are too old to work.
</P>
<P>
Tangshan is about 150 km east of Beijing.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Races Toward Economic Globalization (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China's largest economic center
of Shanghai is increasing its global cooperation, as overseas
capital rushes in and more local companies choose to test the
waters in markets elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
"Shanghai's economic contact with the rest of the world is
increasing, and the city is marching toward the great goal of
becoming an international economic, financial and trade center at
an unprecedented speed," a municipal government official said.
</P>
<P>
"One of Shanghai's priorities is to internationalize its
economy," the official told Xinhua News Agency, adding that the
city's comprehensive opening-up drive in recent years has had
successes in forging an overseas-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the influx of overseas capital, technology and
talent, the overseas-related sector's contribution to Shanghai's
economy has surged to 30 percent, a growth of 13 percent, or 287.7
billion yuan (about 34.6 billion U.S. dollars) since last year,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Annual contractual overseas investment in the city topped 10
billion US dollars for the third consecutive year in 1996 to hit
an all-time high of about 11.1 billion US dollars, with 7.51
billion US dollars actually used, up almost 42 percent from 1995.
</P>
<P>
Official data also showed that Shanghai had approved more than
15,000 overseas-funded projects by the end of last year,
attracting over 80.51 billion US dollars in contractual overseas
direct investment.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Police Crack Down on Illegal Emigration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government has always
opposed illegal emigration and police departments in Fujian, where
illegal emigration was once serious, have clamped down on "snake
heads," said a local government advisor today.
</P>
<P>
You Dexin, a member of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee, said the entry
into the United States of some illegal immigrants from China's
Fujian province resulted from the criminal activities of "snake
heads" based in China and the rest of the world and operating in
collusion with one another.
</P>
<P>
"They deceived Chinese citizens for money," said You, who is
also chairman of the Fujian Provincial Committee of the CPPCC, at
a press conference today organized by the ongoing session of the
CPPCC National Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Illegal emigration has caught the attention of the national
and Fujian provincial governments. Cracking down on illegal
emigration has been an important part of government work in
Changle and Lianjiang counties, where illegal emigration was most
serious," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Races Toward Economic Globalization (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"Overseas investment has helped ease a capital shortage in
Shanghai's economic construction and generated an annual tax
revenue of nearly ten billion yuan," he said. "Moreover, it has
helped bring in advanced technology and management expertise."
</P>
<P>
The Pudong New Area, a de facto special economic zone and an
emerging economic and trade district separated from downtown
Shanghai by the Huangpu River, has become a leader in the city's
race to become a world economic center.
</P>
<P>
Rapid economic development and accelerated opening-up over the
past six years have turned the area into a favorite destination of
overseas investment, the official said, adding that as many as 63
multinationals have landed in the area, with overseas-funded firms
making up 35 percent of the area's gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
And while overseas capital, technology and managers are lured
to the city by its great economic prospects, over 400 companies in
Shanghai have ventured overseas, making handsome investments in
more than 50 countries and regions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co. Ltd, a Pudong-based
producer of cranes for handling containers, has successfully taken
its business to dozens of the world's leading ports and earned 80
million US dollars from exports last year.
</P>
<P>
Already the nation's biggest technology-intensive base for
manufacturing, processing industries and technological
development, Shanghai still seeks to tap its potential in
technology exports, which raked in 400 million US dollars last
year.
</P>
<P>
The city will also load its technology export information onto
the Internet later this year to boost the exporting business,
according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Closer ties with the rest of the world significantly hiked up
the city's foreign trade volume to 22.26 billion US dollars-worth
last year, up 16.8 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Opening yuan-based business to overseas banks in the Pudong New
Area, which was first sanctioned by the central bank late last
year as a major move to open the nation's financial sector, has
pushed Shanghai a substantial step closer toward the goal of going
global financially, experts said.
</P>
<P>
To date, eight overseas branch banks in China, including
Citibank of the United States, the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking
Corp. and the Industrial Bank of Japan, have been given the
green light to deal in the Chinese currency, the Renminbi yuan.
</P>
<P>
A total of 193 overseas financial institutions had opened in
Shanghai by the end of last year, with their assets valued well
over 13.5 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Observers maintain that all aspects of Shanghai's growing
economic exchange with other parts of the world as well as its
past glory as an economic and financial haven in the Far East are
combining to add more international clout to its economy.
</P>
<P>
"The economic globalization of Shanghai is something that is
already riding on a fast track," one analyst said.

<HEADLINE> China Tightens International Co-op in Wetlands Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIDAIHE, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China will enhance its
international cooperation in protecting and reasonably utilizing
the country's wetlands, said a Chinese official, who is attending
an international symposium on wetlands and water birds protection.
</P>
<P>
China will cooperate with the International Wetlands
Organization to evaluate, monitor, and manage the country's
wetlands and make relevant policies, the official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the symposium, which followed the establishment of
China's office of the International Wetlands Organization, shows
that the Chinese government is making further progress in
protecting wetlands.
</P>
<P>
The office, set up in Beijing, will help China to make contact
with other countries and organizations, work out the plan for
wetlands protection and apply for international aid, said Chen
Kelin, who heads the office.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands are a kind of ecosystem, including lakes and
marshlands, with ecological and economic functions such as storing
floodwater for use against drought.
</P>
<P>
China now has 63 million hectares of various kinds of wetlands,
or 6.6 percent of the national total area and ranking first in
Asia, among which some have been listed as "Wetlands of
International Importance."
</P>
<P>
The symposium, which is held in Beidaihe, a sea-side resort in
north China's Hebei Province, is jointly sponsored by the Chinese
Ministry of Forestry, the Japan's Environmental Agency and the
Asia-Pacific Branch of the Wetlands International.

<HEADLINE> China's Biggest Industrial City Deepening Reforms of State Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai, China's largest
industrial city, is moving quickly to deepen reforms in its
state-owned firms and has made remarkable headway in creating a
modern enterprise system.
</P>
<P>
Trial reforms aimed at instituting the system in unprofitable
plants are in place in 250 state-owned firms, which account for 80
percent of the city's total state assets, according to officials
from the municipal economic and trade commission.
</P>
<P>
The modern enterprise system, an option developed by the
central government to pull money-losing firms out of difficulty,
separates the functions of government and businesses, and gives
more leeway to the managers of the firms rather than the
supervisors.
</P>
<P>
Of the 250 large businesses that are implementing the modern
enterprise system on an experimental basis, 120 have restructured
their management plans and are now prepared to enliven their
assets and optimize operations.
</P>
<P>
So far, Shanghai has turned 18 bureaus overseeing state-owned
firms into state-owned shareholding companies or large enterprise
groups.
</P>
<P>
With pillar industries, brand products and well-to-do firms
leading the way, Shanghai has set up quite a few big enterprise
groups through mergers and buy-outs.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the city is speeding up the reorganization of its
small enterprises, while shifting the responsibility of 231 such
firms to districts and counties. Fifty-nine firms that
were no longer competitive on the market have been merged, while
43 unprofitable companies have gone bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
The move has helped bring the debt rate of small state-owned
industrial firms down from 80 percent in 1994 to 67 percent in
1996.

<HEADLINE> Ethnical, Religious Figures Urged to Safeguard Unity, Stability </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A leader from China's religious
circle today called on ethnical and religious figures to assist
the central authorities in safeguarding stability and unity, and
in firmly combating separatist activities.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Puchu, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and chairman of
its Subcommittee of Nationalities and Religion, made the remark on
a meeting of the subcommittee today.
</P>
<P>
Zhao, also president of the Chinese Buddhist Association, said,
"the freedom of religious belief for all ethnical groups should
specially be respected and protected when we are fighting against
separatist activities."
</P>
<P>
When reviewing important expositions set forth by Deng
Xiaoping, the late senior Chinese leader, on the national
minorities and religious affairs, he said, there would be no
all-round restoration and implementation of the Party's policies
on nationalities and religions without Deng's ideological line on
the emancipation of the people's mind and seeking truth from
facts.
</P>
<P>
The work concerning nationalities and religions is of great
importance, which concerns the reunification of the motherland and
prosperity and development in ethnic minority regions, and is
closely related to the overall situation across the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged that CPPCC National Committee members to perform their
duties well and reflect popular feelings of the ethnical and
religious affairs promptly.
</P>
<P>
Although religion is not the basic feature of an ethnic group,
Zhao noted, the two issues are interelated and inseparable, and
improper handling of the religious issue will be detrimental to
ethnical unity and social stability, and consequently hamper
economic and cultural progress in national minority regions.
</P>
<P>
The Subcommittee of Nationalities and Religions, which
comprises more than 150 members, represents various ethnic and
religious groups.
</P>
<P>
In today's meeting, the subcommittee also defined its work this
year, which will focus on promotion of economic, socialist ethical
and cultural progress in ethnic minority areas based on unity,
stability and development.

<HEADLINE> Eastern Airlines, American Airlines Sign Codesharing MOU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Though routes to China are not
yet opened, American Airlines (AA), the largest in the US, will be
able to extend its service to Chinese cities by allowing China's
Eastern Airlines to use its "AA" designator code.
</P>
<P>
This will be possible after a memorandum of understanding of
cooperation signed recently between the two airlines in Dallas is
approved by the Chinese and US governments.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the agreement, the two airlines will use Los
Angeles and San Francisco as the transit points to extend their
routes by exchanging codes.
</P>
<P>
For example, Eastern Airlines will sell the flights operated by
AA between Los Angeles or San Francisco to New York, Chicago,
Washington and Dallas as its own, by putting its "MU" code on AA
flights.
</P>
<P>
And in turn, AA's routes will be extended to Shanghai and
Beijing when flights of the Eastern Airlines from Los Angeles and
San Francisco use AA's designation.
</P>
<P>
"The cooperation, which is a common practice internationally,
will enable the two air companies to increase routes at lower
costs and reduce the transit flight rates of the passengers,"
sources said.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Orders Closure of PNA Offices in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In a move that will fuel the
dispute over eastern Jerusalem, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin
Netanyahu has ordered the closure of four offices run by the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) in the city.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu gave the order late Tuesday night to Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani, who will serve the letters
of closure today. The decision on the closure was reportedly
based on the recommendation of anti-terrorism chief Meir Dagan.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after meeting with visiting presidents of major
U.S. Jewish organizations late Tuesday night, Netanyahu
reiterated that Israel had the sovereign rights over its
self-declared capital of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"We have consistent reports that I received from various
security agencies about the extent of the PNA violations (of the
Oslo accords) in Jerusalem. Under the Oslo, they commit
themselves to not having governmental institutions in Jerusalem
or PNA governmental activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not asking them to shut them down, we are shutting
them down," Netanyahu stressed.
</P>
<P>
Kahalani today will hold consultations with Jerusalem police
on the closures and issued the letters to notify the concerned
PNA offices in the first stage. He warned that if the PNA refused
to cooperate, the police would take necessary steps which he did
not elaborate, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The radio report said, however, that the police were unlikely
to shut down the PNA offices now because of the possibility of
appealing to the High Court of Justice by the PNA.
</P>
<P>
So far the names of the targeted offices have not been
released, but a statement issued by the Prime Minister's Office
said that the security apparatus run by PNA security head Jibril
Rajoub would be expelled from eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The decision to close the PNA offices was take on the eve of
Netanyahu's visit to Egypt today and at a time when Israel came
under increasing international criticism of its plan to build
Jewish settlement in Har Homa in Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
This move is expected to fuel the already high tension
between Israel and the PNA. But Netanyahu's aides sharply denied
that the timing of the closures was political, rather they
insisted it was bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
"I want to make clear that the closure of the offices has
nothing to do with Har Homa, nothing to do with the visit to
Egypt, and nothing to do with the upcoming further
redeployments," Netanyahu's media adviser David Bar-Illan was
quoted by The Jerusalem Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
The move also came as Netanyahu is seeking to galvanize a
majority for a pullback in the West Bank at the Thursday's
cabinet meeting. Under the Hebron agreement, Israel should
complete the first stage of the three-phase redeployments in the
West Bank.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that Netanyahu is seeking to widen the scope
of further troop pullouts in the West Bank in order to silence
the Palestinian protests over the Har Homa project and the
closure of PNA offices.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Continues to Fall in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' year-on-year
inflation dropped to 4.4 percent in February this year compared
with five percent in January as prices of most commodities in the
country fell during that month, the National Statistics Office
said today.
</P>
<P>
The statistics office said in a report that on a month-on-month
basis, consumer prices continued to drop and stood at 0.4 percent
in February as compared with 0.6 percent in January and 0.8
percent last December.
</P>
<P>
"Prices of all the major commodity groups slowed down except in
the housing and repairs index which went up by 0.4 percentage
point to 9.6 percent from 9.2 percent in January," it said.
</P>
<P>
However, the inflation rate in Metro Manila was recorded at 6.6
percent in February and 6.1 percent in January, the office said.
</P>
<P>
The latest inflation data indicates that consumer price
increases this year could be boxed into the government's target of
six to 6.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the country's inflation was recorded at 8.4 percent,
just within the government's target of 7.5-8.5 percent.

<HEADLINE> Mobile Police Unit Set up in Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan police have set up a
Mobile Unit equipped with modern weapons to combat escalating
crimes like armed robberies in the country, the Daily Nation
paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new unit will use specially designed Land Rovers and act
as a special rapid deployment force to preempt car thefts, bank
robberies and other crimes.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-eight new police vehicles will be fully equipped with
modern weapons and communication facilities to enable policemen
to swiftly respond to armed robberies in the eastern African
country, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
Last week, five gangsters, three of them in police uniforms,
raided Trust Bank in the port city of Mombasa and grab about
240,000 Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, about 1.7 million U.S. Dollars were robbed by
gunmen at a branch of the Standard Chartered Bank in the capital
city of Nairobi.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, about one million Dollars was casually stolen from
the Embakasi strongroom of Kenya Handling Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Police Commissioner Duncan Wachira as saying
on Tuesday that the Police Mobile Unit will be deployed in
Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, Nakuru, Eldoret, Kiambu and Thika, and
in bandit-prone areas to help combating cattle-rustling.
</P>
<P>
Wachira noted that as criminals have become sophisticated and
have acquired faster and more powerful cars, the policemen need
better vehicles to cope with the criminals.
</P>
<P>
He said that the purchase of the vehicles by the government
was a first step toward ensuring the total security for everyone
in the country.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Attracts More Investment from Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Fujian, a coastal province which
faces Taiwan across a strait, had approved 4,533 Taiwan-funded
enterprises by the end of last year, involving more than nine
billion US dollars, said a local government advisor here today.
</P>
<P>
In a press conference organized by the Fifth Session of the
Eighth Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
National Committee which has been in session since the end of
February, You Dexin, chairman of the CPPCC Fujian Provincial
Committee expressed his confidence in seeing more Taiwan funds
pouring into Fujian in the near future.
</P>
<P>
You expressed the hope that transportation and business circles
in Taiwan would forge closer ties with related departments in
Fujian to promote direct shipping services between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question from a Voice of America reporter
about members of Taiwan mafia seeking a safe haven in Fujian, You
said this is "possible" given recent crackdowns on mafia
activities in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
"These elements will harm public security in Fujian," he said.
"Police departments in Fujian have been cooperating closely with
local residents in ferreting out any criminals that may have
hidden in Fujian."
</P>
<P>
He called for police in Fujian and Taiwan to exchange related
information and cooperate with each other in cracking down on
crimes.

<HEADLINE> Selected Librettos Collected by Qing Prince Brought To Light </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Librettos selected from a
collection of a prince of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) have been
published by the Beijing Ancient Books Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The collection, most of which has never been published before,
consists of 1,585 pieces of hand-written works, falling into two
categories -- librettos and verses for singing.
</P>
<P>
The newly published selection, which comprises two-thirds of
the collection, is divided into 1,100 columns in 200 boxes.
</P>
<P>
Photomechanically printed on Xuan paper, a high quality paper
made in Xuancheng, Anhui Province especially prized for
traditional Chinese paintings and calligraphy, the selections are
packaged in boxes wrapped in Song (960-1279) style embroideries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts say that the selection rivals, in terms of
academic significance, the canon of Tang (618-907) poetry and the
works of Song Ci, in which poetry written to certain tunes with
strict tonal patterns and rhyme schemes, and fixed numbers of
lines and words, was fully developed in the Song Dynasty.

<HEADLINE> Famine Threatens Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Famine looms in 19 of Uganda's 39
districts and the government has sent a SOS message to relevant
donors, a high-ranking official has said.
</P>
<P>
Paul Etyang, the third deputy prime minister and the minister
of labor and social affairs, said in a statement in Parliament
that 2.1 million Ugandans are likely to be affected.
</P>
<P>
The Uganda government has called on World Food Program (WFP),
U.N. Children's Fund (UNICEF), U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) and the International Committee of Red Cross for
urgent assistance, The New Vision daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The government has taken precaution measures against
starvation, Etyang was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He blamed famine on rebellion in the north and in Kasese
district in the west, indiscriminate sale of food after harvest
in the east and ecological factors.
</P>
<P>
Among the 19 famine-harassed districts are Apac, Gulu, Kitgum
districts in the north, Soroti, Kumi, Moroto, Pallisa, Mbale
districts in the east, Mukono, Rakai districts in the central and
Maindi, Kabale, Kabarole and Kisoro districts in the west.
</P>
<P>
District disaster committees have been established, but their
operation are being constrained due to lack of sufficient funds,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan government has so far allocated 284 million of
Uganda Shillings (some 284,000 U.S. Dollars) from its treasury to
ease the famine, Etyang told the parliament session.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait to Allow Foreign Residents to Deal Shares </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A comprehensive study has been
completed in Kuwait to allow foreign residents to deal in stocks
and shares in the small desert country, according to local press
reports today.
</P>
<P>
An announcement by Kuwait's Ministry of Commerce and Industry,
published today in Kuwaiti newspapers, said that the ministry
recently completed a study permitting expatriates residing in
Kuwait to buy and sell Kuwaiti shares.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti bourse has 47 banks and companies with a
market capitalization of around 10 billion U.S. dollars. Before
1990, there were 54 institutions with a capitalization of 12
billion U.S. dollars and the market was the busiest in the
Middle East due to widespread speculation.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait shut the door for foreign investors just after its
liberation from Iraqi occupation in 1991, and it re-opened the
door for citizens of the other five Gulf Cooperation Council
countries -- Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Oman, Bahrain
 and Qatar in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kuwait signed a pact on a joint formula to link its
stock exchange market with those of Bahrain and Oman to allow
each other to register limited liability companies in any of the
three markets and encourage investment among them.
</P>
<P>
Trading in the Kuwaiti Stock Exchange Market has been very
active since last year.
</P>
<P>
The expected re-opening of Kuwaiti bourse to foreigners other
than only GCC citizens would attract foreign investors and
stop the flow of capital from the country by encouraging
expatriate workers to send less money home, observers here
noted.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to See New Gem-testing Technique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is expected to have a new
testing technique to separate synthetic amethysts from natural
ones, a local newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The new testing technology, which was developed by a laboratory
at the Asian Institute of Gemmological Sciences, will
significantly help the country screen those fakes on the market in
this category of gemstone, the Bangkok Post said.
</P>
<P>
However, the lab did not disclose the details of the technique
as it worried about that producers of synthetic amethysts would
improve their own techniques to foil the new method.
</P>
<P>
During the trial testing period starting last November, the lab
tested a large number of amethyst parcels and did find a single
parcel with 100 percent natural amethysts, the lab management
said.
</P>
<P>
In some parcels, 60 percent were found as synthetics, while
stones in some other parcels were all synthetic, they said.
</P>
<P>
The practice of mixing synthetic gemstones with natural ones
has been widespread on the market, the newspaper said, adding that
the new method with high accuracy will greatly help curb this
practice.
</P>
<P>
The lab currently is expanding the scope of this testing
method. The cost for testing is about 25 baht (about 1 U.S.
dollars) per stone for bulk orders and 60 to 70 baht (about 2.4 to
2.8 dollars) per stone for a single stone.

<HEADLINE> Precious, Ancient Stone Tablet Copied </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A stone tablet from the Tang Dynasty
(618-907), appraised as a national treasure, has been copied in
China's northwest Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
The tablet, built according to imperial verdict, bears
inscriptions of an article written by Wei Zheng, a prominent
minister in the early days of the Tang Dynasty, and handwriting by
Ouyang Xun, one of the most famous calligraphers in Chinese
history.
</P>
<P>
Carved by top craftsmen of the dynasty, the tablet with
inscriptions on Liquan (wine spring) in Jiucheng Palace in Linyou
County, was called "the best example of regular script".
</P>
<P>
Over the past centuries, however, the tablet was seriously damaged
by outdoor exhibition and frequent rubbings in subsequent dynasties.
</P>
<P>
Nineteen characters of the 1,108-character inscription were
missing, 39 characters incomplete, while another 180 characters
have blurred. The entire tablet has lost much of its original
look.
</P>
<P>
To restore the original look of the tablet, Ren Buwu, a
64-year-old calligrapher in Shaanxi, decided to copy the
inscription with support from Chinese archaeological and
calligraphical communities.
</P>
<P>
With a rubbing from the early Song Dynasty (960-1279) as his
model, the earliest of its kind in existence, Ren consulted
six other inscriptions by Ouyang Xun and some 200 stone tablets
from the Northern Wei Dynasty (386-534) to repair the 238 missing,
incomplete or blurred characters.
</P>
<P>
It took two years for Ren to study the characters and more than
another year for him and several famous craftsmen to write and
carve the article on a piece of shallow grey marble.
</P>
<P>
The new tablet is 210 cm high, 35 cm over the original, 110 cm
wide, 15-25 cm wider than the original, with a 110 cm cap, 20 cm
higher than the original cap.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts, who gathered here recently to assess the new
tablet, spoke highly of Ren's work, saying that it has recreated
much of Ouyang Xun's style, and has been a great essay in carrying
on traditional calligraphy.
</P>
<P>
The new tablet is now collected in the Museum of Baoji City.
</P>
<P>
The original, having been covered by a kiosk in Linyou county
in Baoji, has attracted hundreds of thousands of tourists from
both home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> Israel Proposes to Turkey to Modernize Tanks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel has made a proposal for
Turkey to modernize its aged M-60 tanks, local newspaper Daily
News reported here today.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli proposal was officially made early this year
and envisages the modernization of about 300 U.S.-made M-60
tanks in a program to be carried out both in Turkey and
Israel, the paper quoted a Turkish defense source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The source said that Turkish and Israeli sides have not
discussed the cost and length of the program.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli offer foresees the modernization of the Turkish
Ground Forces' M-60 tanks which remain outdated with their
1960s technology, and Israeli experts also proposed to modernize
the first tank free of charge as a test case," said the
source.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Turkey is to produce at least 1,000 third
generation tanks in a 4.5-billion-U.S.-dollar project to meet the
defense needs of the army's 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Turkey and Israel have signed two agreements on military
training and defense industry cooperation between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
The military training agreement, signed in February 1996,
sparked a quarrel in Mideast countries as they believed that
Turkey was aligning itself with Israel against the interests of
Arab countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel's State Revenues Fall 6 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Israel's state revenues fell 6
percent to 8.1 billion shekels (about 2.3 billion U.S. dollars)
last month from 8.6 billion shekels (about 2.5 billion
U.S. dollars) in January.
</P>
<P>
Today's Jerusalem Post said that over the last three months
state revenues dropped 0.7 percent in real terms to 25.3 billion
shekels (about 8 billion dollars) compared with the same period a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
These are the latest of a series of figures showing that the
Israeli Treasury is finding it consistently difficult to meet
its own revenue targets.
</P>
<P>
The treasury placed much of the blame of last year's
large budget deficit, and subsequent need for the budget cut,
on the failure to collect revenues according to the
projections formulated last summer.
</P>
<P>
This continued failure could result in a further budget cut
of up to 2 billion shekels (some 650 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
Israeli Finance Minister Dan Meridor has repeatedly said he
will not countenance further cuts until he has digested all
the budgetary data for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Finance Ministry could face an annual
shortfall of 3 billion to 3.5 billion shekels (around one billion
dollars), according to initial forecasts by economists.
</P>
<P>
However, senior treasury officials are dismissing these figures
as exaggerated.

<HEADLINE> Mine-Shaft Prisons Under Consideration: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Overcrowding in prison has
promoted South African security authorities to consider turning
disused mine shafts into "maximum security prisons", the Citizen
daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to Department of Correctional Services Commissioner
Khulekani Sithole, there are more than 124,000 inmates in South
African jails, which are designed for only 97,000.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to put prisoners into mine-shafts is aimed at
alleviating overcrowding in jails in the country, Sithole said.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the idea of underground prisons is to
prevent increasing escapees, he said.
</P>
<P>
Department of Correctional Services spokesman Rudi Potgieter
said yesterday that the idea of using disused mines also included
making use of existing infrastructures, such as old mine
buildings.
</P>
<P>
However, Potgieter said details on what "super maximum
security prisons" would entail were sketchy at present as the
idea needed thorough investigation.

<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- About 32 women dairy
farmers from Arusha and Kilimanjaro regions in Northern Tanzania,
have begun a two-week course on milk processing at the Livestock
Training Institute in Arusha, Daily News reported today.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the course is part of Overseas Development
Administration (ODA) (of Great Britain) post-Beijing project
aimed at developing the grass-roots women by training them in
different sectors, in an effort to raise their standard of
living.
</P>
<P>
The reports added that another group of 30 dairy keepers from
Tanga and Coast Regions will join the institute for a similar
course beginning March 10.
</P>
<P>
At the same time the third group of women dairy farmers'
course will be held at the Uyole Agricultural Training Center in
Mbeya for Mbeya and Iringa Regions.
</P>
<P>
During the course, the participants learn how to make yoghurt,
cheese, butter and ghee. Processing milk is considered to be a
last solution to destruction of the product due to lack of
equipment to preserve it in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The first post ODA/Beijing course attended by 40 women
handicraft workers last December in Dar es salaam has already
produced the desired fruits as the quality of products produced
by the women have improved tremendously.

<HEADLINE> China Initiating Interprovincial Grain Reserve Transfer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, MARCH 5 (Xinhua) -- When the train from northeast
China, fully loaded with maize, arrived in southwest China a few
days later, the interprovincial grain reserve transfer began.
</P>
<P>
China reaped a record harvest in 1996. Total grain output
reached 480 billion kilograms. Northeast China's Jilin Province, a
major grain production base, yielded 23.2 billion kilograms of
grain, 2.5 billion kilograms beyond their capacity to stock.
</P>
<P>
To ease the storage pressure, the State Council initiated the
large-scale transfer to equalize distribution of grain reserves
and stabilize the grain market.
</P>
<P>
The first batch of 1.5 million tons of maize from Jilin is to
be transported to the most populous Sichuan Province, southwest of
China. More will be shipped out of the three northeastern
provinces and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
All concerned provinces and ministries give the transfer the
green light. The Jilin Province loses no time drying grains of
high moisture content, and the Railway Ministry arranges carriages
while the Bank of Agricultural Development ensures capital.

Jin proposed the following to create more jobs:
</P>
<P>
First, efforts should be made to strengthen a comprehensive
development of agriculture so that as much rural surplus labor can
be absorbed locally as possible.
</P>
<P>
Second, in industrial restructuring, state enterprises should
try their best to find a way out for their own surplus labor.
</P>
<P>
Third, development of service industries should be speeded
up.
</P>
<P>
Fourth, non-public economic sectors should play a greater
role in executing reemployment programs. And
</P>
<P>
Fifth, the government can organize labor export in a planned
way.
</P>
<P>
Jin, who is also chairman of the All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce, called on federation of industry and
commerce organizations at all levels to take an active part in
employment programs launched by the government to make their "due
contributions to reform, opening-up, economic development and
social stability."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Import 20,000 Oxen of Find Breed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican government is
planning to import 20,000 head of cattle of fine breed in the
next five years in attempts to boost the livestock farming.
</P>
<P>
The imported oxen will be distributed to private sectors and
peasant households as the government attaches more importance to
the private sectors which have the basic facilities and
technologies on raising cattle.
</P>
<P>
The government has imported 4,000 oxen of fine breed in the
last three years, according to a document issued by the National
Livestock Husbandry Authority today.
</P>
<P>
However, the beef product in this southern African country
dropped by six percent from 1995's 845 tons to 796 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The number of cattle in Mozambique sharply fell from 1.4
million head in 1974 to only 214,000 in 1993, turning it from a
self-sufficient beef country into a beef-importing nation.
</P>
<P>
The country's pork output stood at 284 tons in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, chicken product in Mozambique rose to 4,938 tons in
1996, 33 percent up compared with 1995's 3,700 tons. enditem

<HEADLINE> PNA Declares Friday Jerusalem Defense Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) has declared Friday as "the Defense of Jerusalem
Day," in a series of protests against Israel's decision to build
a new Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
PNA called on Palestinian residents in the West Bank to attend
a prayer service at the Har Homa (Jabal Abu Ghneim), in the
southeastern outskirts of Jerusalem, where the new Jewish
neighborhood is planned to be built, Israel Radio reported this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Earlier last week, the Israeli government approved the plan to
build 6,500 Jewish homes in Har Homa, of which 2,450 will be
completed in the first three years.
</P>
<P>
In parallel, the government said it would start to build
3,015 units for Palestinians in 10 existing neighborhoods within
the city limits.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials reacted angrily to the building plan,
saying the Israeli government's decision is a violation of law
and its agreements with the Palestinians, and has put the
peace process in danger.
</P>
<P>
PNA President Yasser Arafat, who is currently visiting the
United States, has said that the Israeli government's decision
to go ahead with the construction of Har Homa presented a
"real challenge" to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is due to brief the United Nations Security Council
today shortly before the council, requested by the PNA and
other Arab countries, starts to debate the Har Homa issue.
</P>
<P>
Later in the weekend, the PNA president is also expected
to participate in a massive rally in the Gaza Strip to
protest against the building of Har Homa.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian organizers told Israel Radio that the protests by
the Palestinian people will be "no-violent."
</P>
<P>
However, a senior Israeli police officer warned that if the
construction of Har Homa begins, the Palestinians will response
with rioting on a scale similar to that after the opening
of the Western Wall Tunnel last September.
</P>
<P>
During a violent confrontation between Palestinian police and
Israeli soldiers, triggered off by the opening of the tunnel
by Israel in Jerusalem's Old City, more than 70 people were
killed and hundreds of others wounded.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Har Homa construction, scheduled to start
Tuesday, has been postponed due "technical reasons," but Israel
Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu stressed that Israel will
carry out the project soon.

<HEADLINE> Desert Turns into Tibet's Warehouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Golmud, a city built 34 years ago on
a sparsely-populated desert, has become the largest warehouse for
southwest China's Tibet Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
So far, Golmud in Qinghai Province has set up more than 50
bases in Tibet, providing commercial goods, petroleum, grain,
medicine and farm machinery to the remote Himalayan region. Tibet
also invested more than 30 million yuan in setting up processing
enterprises in Golmud.
</P>
<P>
In 1953, China built the Qinghai-Tibet highway with an
elevation of 4,500 meters, the highest in the world.
</P>
<P>
With the constant improvement of the highway and the expansion
of links between Tibet and other parts of China, Golmud, which is
about 800 km from the provincial capital of Xining, has not only
become the second largest city in Qinghai, but also a storehouse
for goods for Tibet.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 44 years, China has transported 15 million tons
of goods from the landlocked area to Tibet, and large amount of
animal products, minerals, medicine and timber from Tibet back to
the inland.

<HEADLINE> Legislators, Advisors Call for More Educational Input </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators and government
advisors today called for increasing financial input in education.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hu, a noted educationist, appreciated the government for
its efforts to increase its investment in education and but said
that the key to increasing input lies in the maintenance of its
status as the chief investor in education.
</P>
<P>
Laws should be strictly enforced and efforts be made to
guarantee that the proportion of educational investment to
finances at all levels rises along with the growth of the national
economy, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is stipulated in the Education Law," he said.
</P>
<P>
Wang has submitted a proposal in this regard along with 30
other members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), the country's top
advisory body that is in its fifth session here.
</P>
<P>
Chen Xiuli, a deputy to the National People's Congress, said an
prevalent problem is that some local officials have failed to
recognize the strategic importance of developing education, noting
that some financial allocations for education have been increased
and channels of collecting funds for education needs to be
diversified.
</P>
<P>
"To grasp Comrade Deng Xiaoping's thinking of revitalizing the
country through science and technology is still the No.1 task of
officials at various levels," Chen said.
</P>
<P>
Many deputies and members held that educational funds can be
raised through a combination of various channel since the state
treasury is financial strained.
</P>
<P>
NPC Deputy Xu Jialu said that the on-going efforts to merge
financially-weak institutions of higher learning will help amass
limited funds and materials.
</P>
<P>
"Our focus should shift to quality and efficiency," he said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Qi Kang said inadequate funding for education has
something to do with a lack of scientific planning.
</P>
<P>
However, CPPCC National Committee Member Liang Zhiwen said: "If
the state-owned enterprises become more efficient, funding for
education won't be a problem."
</P>
<P>
Qu Shijing of the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, urged
the authorities to improve the structure of educational input.
</P>
<P>
The per-capita educational funding for middle and primary
school students is about 4.7 and 1.8 percent of the average for
students at higher learning institutions, he said, noting that the
figure in other countries stands at more than 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
"This is a reason that China's primary education is large in
size but poor is efficiency," Qu said.
</P>
<P>
The proportion of China's public educational funding to the
gross domestic product reached 3.3 percent in 1980 and 3.6 percent
in 1985. At present, the figure is just over two percent, lower
than the average for developing countries.
</P>
<P>
As the national economy grows, China can increase the figure to
four percent, as stipulated in a program for the country's
educational reform and development, Wang Hu said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya sells 5 Parastatal Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
approved the sale of five parastatal companies under the on-going
privatization program, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted George Mitine, Investment Secretary of the
Parastatal Reform Program Committee, as saying that the committee
had proved the sale of government shares of five firms.
</P>
<P>
The Kenya Tourism Development Corporation shares in the Sunset
Hotel was sold to Piedmont Investment Ltd. at a price of about 20
million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
The committee approved the sale of 550,000 shares owned by the
government in Kenya National Properties to the ICDC Investment
Company at an offer price of four Dollars a share through
preemptive rights.
</P>
<P>
The government shares were also sold in Dawa Pharmaceuticals,
Safari Lodges and Properties, and Polysynthetic E.A.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a second disbursement of 37 million
Dollars from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to Kenya under
a soft-loan program has been delayed for three months because of
what the fund sees as slow progress on privatization.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Kenya agreed on a 220 million Dollars aid plan
under the IMF soft-loan Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility.
</P>
<P>
The first disbursement of 37 million Dollars was issued early
last year and the second one was due in November 1996.
</P>
<P>
An IMF official was quoted as saying that "what we want is to
avoid budgetary funds being used to help out ailing parastatals."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Deputies Call for Enhanced History Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Chinese legislators today called
for increasing Chinese history education among primary and middle
school students to promote socialist ethical and cultural
progress.
</P>
<P>
Ren Jiyu, director of Beijing Library, China's national
library, has forwarded a proposal in this regard to the Eighth
National People's Congress, the country's legislature, that has
been in session since last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese history provides a data bank for promoting ethical
and cultural progress, is an adhesive for unifying the 1.2 billion
people and contains seeds for cultivating patriotism," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If you do not know the dynasties of Xia, Shang and Zhou, the
Opium War, Sun Yat-sen or Japanese aggression against China, you
are not a qualified Chinese," he said.
</P>
<P>
Xia is believed to be the first dynasty in Chinese history,
which span the 21th-16th centuries B.C., followed by Shang (about
16th-11th centuries B.C.) and Zhou (about 11th century B.C.-221
B.C.).
</P>
<P>
"Ideological and moral education based on history will be
more lifelike and will increase people's patriotism," Ren said.
</P>
<P>
Feng Xianzhi, director of Party Literature Research Center of
the CPC Central Committee, said that the promotion of ethical and
cultural progress should be started in kindergartens and primary
schools.
</P>
<P>
"Schools are not only places where knowledge is disseminated,
but also important places for moral education," he said, adding
that such education should be carried out through primary schools,
middle schools and institutions of higher learning.
</P>
<P>
Kuang Peizi, a research fellow of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, said that China's basic education should focus more on
students' overall qualities and moral standards.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Zhongli, president of the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, said that China's ongoing effort to promote ethical
and cultural progress is not a short-term act.
</P>
<P>
He also proposed legislation for the promotion of ethical and
cultural progress.

<HEADLINE> NZ to Try Hidden Speed Cameras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand police will begin
using hidden speed cameras on roads from July this year in central
North Island.
</P>
<P>
If proved successful, the camera will be introduced throughout
the country after a 12-month trial. Roads in central North Island
are considered to carry high risks of accidents.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the trial today, Transport Minister Jenny Shipley
indicated that the aim is to cut the road toll. She pointed out
that 20 more people have been killed on roads this year compared
with the same period in 1996.
</P>
<P>
However, she said hidden cameras will be only used in areas
currently designated for speed cameras.

<HEADLINE> Hainan Health Care Improved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The average life expectancy has
more than doubled since 1949 in Hainan Province, China's largest
special economic zone.
</P>
<P>
Due to the improved health care in the province, the average
life expectancy now reached 73 years old, above the national
average, as opposed to 35 years old before the founding of new
China.
</P>
<P>
Located in the tropical area with a hot and rainy weather,
Hainan Island previously had been a breeding ground for infectious
diseases. In 1987, the incidence of such diseases was double the
national average.
</P>
<P>
Since Hainan Province became China's special economic zone, the
local government made a point of listing medical work in its plan
for economic and social development.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, the province had 1,712 medical
organizations, more than 30,000 medical workers (about four for
every 1,000 people) and more than 20,000 beds in hospitals (about
three for every 1,000 people).
</P>
<P>
Rural medical work and the prevention and cure of infectious
diseases had been major tasks for medical care throughout the 1991-
1996 period.
</P>
<P>
By last year, some 128 million yuan (15.2 million US dollars) of
special funds were injected into the rural medical system. And 4,494
medical workers with college education, employed by the rural
medical organizations, significantly improved the quality of care.
</P>
<P>
The local government educated people to develop better hygiene,
and some fatal infectious diseases were wiped out.
</P>
<P>
The province has basically eliminated the incidence of
filariasis, and no cases of dengue fever were reported in the past
four years. No cases of wild strain polio have been reported in
the last three years.
</P>
<P>
After 1992, the province set up a medical system allowing for
various kinds of ownership to complement the state-owned
hospitals.

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Byron Black of Zimbabwe upset
top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile 6-1, 4-6, 7-6 (7-5) in the

</P>
<P>
Rios was not the only seed eliminated in the tournament.
Spain's Javier Sanchez also ousted No. 5 Andre Agassi of the

</P>
<P>
After Australian Patrick Rafter beat No. 6 Alberto Berasategui

was left with three seeded players who got past the first round.
</P>
<P>
Rios, the world's sixth-ranked player, failed to advance for

1996 Scottsdale final before losing to Wayne Ferreira, this year's
No. 2 seed, who lost Monday.
</P>
<P>
No. 4 Albert Costa and No. 8 Richey Reneberg advanced.
</P>
<P>
Costa, one of six Spanish players involved in the 32-player

WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- American Andre Agassi became
the latest upset victims in the first round of the
328,000-U.S-Dollar Scottsdale Tennis tournament on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Unseeded Javier Sanchez of Spain took just 69 minutes to upset
fifth-seed Agassi 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
"It's a pretty big win for me," said Sanchez, the world's
No. 37 ranked player.
</P>
<P>
Agassi admitted that he failed to take the advantage, still he
showed his surprise about the results.
</P>
<P>
Agassi had not played an ATP Tournament since the U.S. Open in
September until returning in February. He suffered a sprained
left ankle in a first-round loss in Memphis in February.
</P>
<P>
Sanchez took the first set, reeling off the last four games,
including a pair of service breaks.
</P>
<P>
He went up 4-2 in the second with a crucial break in the sixth
game and held on to warp up the victory.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Raises Product Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai Municipality, the
largest manufacturing center in China, is raising product
standards with stronger administration of quality certificates.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the municipality took the lead in the country by
setting up Shanghai Accreditation Center to issue qualification
certificates to firms with good product quality.
</P>
<P>
So far, 108 foreign-funded, state-owned and township
enterprises in the city have obtained certificates for quality.
</P>
<P>
Accreditation can give enterprises incentive to achieve
greater economic efficiency. A survey showed that after the firms
received accreditation 88.8 percent of firms enjoyed increased
sales volume and 70.4 percent saw more profit.
</P>
<P>
This year, the local government will check the quality of 500
products manufactured by the machine, electronics and auto industries.
</P>
<P>
The accreditation center will also continue to encourage firms
to apply for certificates. This year 300 firms are expected to
pass accreditation standards.
</P>
<P>
China now has more than 20 accreditation organizations of
various kinds, which combined have issued more than 1,000 quality
certificates to firms.

<HEADLINE> Italian Minister: Neapolitan Mafia Going North </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Italy's Interior Minister Giorgio
Napolitano confirmed today the mafia in the country's southern
city of Naples has infiltrated northern regions.
</P>
<P>
The Neapolitan mafia has been transformed in recent years since
the judicial system and law enforcement agencies stepped up fight
against organized crime, Napolitano told senators.
</P>
<P>
The old criminal structure of the mafia, known as the Camorra
since the 1820s, has been "shattered," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister noted, main criminal groups in the
southern Italian port city have regrouped to manage "the most
prominent business areas like arms and drug trafficking."
</P>
<P>
The Camorra has also infiltrated the industrial north,
Napolitano said, suggesting that nobody should fool themselves
into thinking that the Mafia operated only in the south.
</P>
<P>
As a result, rival gangs launched turf wars that have led to
more mafia-related murders since 1996. Of the 139 murders in the
year, 87 involved a mafia-related victim.
</P>
<P>
And so far in 1997, there has been 19 mafia-related murders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Napolitano said, smaller gangs had gotten involved
in a wider range of criminal activities, from smuggling to illegal
gambling.

<HEADLINE> NATO Peace Mission in Bosnia to End On Time: U.S. Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
said here today that in any case the NATO peace operation in
Bosnia will end on time in June of 1998 as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
After talking with his German counterpart Volker Ruehe, Cohen
told reporters that U.S. troops will leave Balkan at the end of
the peacekeeping mission in June next year.
</P>
<P>
"If we retreat from Bosnia after 16 months, the NATO forces
will also leave," he added.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe noted on the occasion that Germany will withdraw its
troops from Bosnia following the retreat of the U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
The United States has about 7,900 troops in Bosnia and Croatia
as part of the 30,000-strong allied peacekeeping forces. Germany
has contributed 3,000 to the mission.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ruehe called for maintaining peace and establishing
stronger balance of power among former warring sides in Bosnia in
the next 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Cohen, on his first trip abroad as Pentagon chief, also talked
with Ruehe on the issues of NATO's eastern expansion, strategic
partnership between NATO and Russia, the future frame of NATO, the
differences between the U.S. and France on the command of the
allied troops in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Both Cohen and Ruehe showed optimism on removing Russia's worry
about NATO's eastern expansion.
</P>
<P>
Cohen said that it is possible for NATO and Russia to sign a
specific charter on the expansion issue.
</P>
<P>
However, it is impossible for Russia to have the veto right
on NATO's internal affairs, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ruehe disclosed that a proposal would be raised at
the upcoming NATO summit in Madrid on accepting Hungary, the Czech
Republic and Poland as NATO members.
</P>
<P>
On U.S.-France differences, Cohen reiterated U.S. refusal to
allow France to command the allied troops in southern Europe. But
Ruehe hoped to find a way of compromise.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe said that in any case, the U.S. should be in the leading
position in the headquarters in the next few years, but an
European should act as aide of the top commander with clear-cut
power scope.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to increase the number of European
officers in the headquarters.
</P>
<P>
On bilateral cooperations, Cohen termed Germany as "the most
important partner" to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Ruehe pointed out that there is a big decrease in the number of
U.S. troops stationed in Europe from 320,000 seven years ago to
100,000 now.
</P>
<P>
Germany has become the largest foreign investor of the U.S.
since 1995, he said, adding that both Germany and the U.S. have
invested 15 billion U.S. dollars in each other's market.
</P>
<P>
He held out hope that cooperation between the two countries
will be furthered in the future.

<HEADLINE> Situation in Albania Worsens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- All regions in Albania today set up
contingent commissions headed by their state governors to exercise
local authority under an order of the Albanian State Defense
Committee.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two days, Tirana and its surrounding areas
appeared calm but several towns in the south, including Vlore and
Sarande, were reportedly out of control.
</P>
<P>
It has been officially confirmed that Chief of the General
Staff of the Albanian National Army Sheme Kosova has been sacked
and replaced by General Adem Cobani, a military advisor to
President Sali Berisha.
</P>
<P>
President Berisha today rejected an opposition call for a
broad-based government to end the country's bloody unrest.
</P>
<P>
In a statement read on state television, Berisha accused the
opposition Socialist Party of organizing "armed rebellion" in the
south of the Balkan state.
</P>
<P>
"You decided to overturn the constitutional order and Albanian
democracy through an armed rebellion and created a grave problem
for the country," Berisha said in the statement issued after his
meeting with Socialist leaders, who called on Berisha to establish
a broad-based government to help end the crisis in the nation.
</P>
<P>
"I am against a coalition between the Democratic Party and the
Socialist Party," said Berisha, who was re-elected to a second
five-year term Monday by the Albanian parliament, where his
Democrats hold virtually all the seats.
</P>
<P>
The Socialists, the biggest force in an 11-party opposition
Forum for Democracy, bluntly denied Berisha's allegations that
they have orchestrated the unrest caused by the collapse of
popular, high-risk investment schemes in which nearly every
Albanian family lost money.
</P>
<P>
The parliament Sunday declared a nationwide state of emergency
and then the Berisha government gave security forces orders to
shoot armed rioters on sight and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew
after protesters stormed a police and army weapons depot and went
on a rampage of looting and burning.
</P>
<P>
More than 20 people have been reported killed in the southern
region since last Friday.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Gjirokaster was said to be calm today after
army tanks entered the city Monday and more than 1,000 pieces of
weapons and a lot of ammunition were retaken in the southern city
of Fier, according to the state television today.
</P>
<P>
European states have expressed their grave concern over the
unrest in the nation. They fear the unrest could reignite the
Balkans by drawing in ethnic Albanians in highly sensitive
neighboring countries with unresolved ethnic and minority issues
although the civil war in the former Yugoslav region ended.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Prepays Foreign Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The Colombian government
decided to pay about 250 million U.S. dollars on its foreign debt
ahead of time to contain another drop of the dollar in the country
like the end of last year, official sources confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
The pre-payment was meant to speed up the amortizations of loans
from commercial banks which are due in the second term this year,
said Clemente de Valle, director of public credit for the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
She also announced that the public sector's foreign debt
program this year would cut 500 million dollars "to help lower
the pressure on the exchange rate and in this way, the Banco de la
Republica will not have to intervene as often in the money market
to neutralize the larger increases in the reserves due to Finance
Ministry disbursements."
</P>
<P>
This was good for the currency market as well as for the money
market, said the official.
</P>
<P>
With the decision the net flow of debt from the international
financial community will be lowered to 1.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Actually, about 1 billion dollars that Colombia received two
weeks ago from a sale of bonds have been frozen abroad. These
funds will be used to pay off loans and interest payments on the
country's foreign debt.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian President Unveils New Plan to Wipe Out Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian President Fernando
Henrique Cardoso today announced a new program to bring children
back to school and wipe out child labor in the country.
</P>
<P>
The program, known as "Brazil, Child Citizen," will be kicked
off next month to benefit initially 30,000 children and eventually
50,000, Cardoso told "the President Speaks Out" TV program.
</P>
<P>
"I am asking governors, prefects and businessmen, in
particular, to elevate their vigilance against child and teenage
labor," the president said of the government initiative.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to join forces as well as human and financial
resources to eradicate child labor from the countryside forever
because a child's place is in school," he added.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 3.8 million Brazilian children under the age
of 14 go to workplace instead of school. They account for 25
percent of the rural labor force in this South American country.
</P>
<P>
The new program is part of a national campaign launched by
President Cardoso on September 6, 1996, when he signed three
documents on the eradication of child labor in Brazil.

SOFIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Bulgaria has called on the
international community to take effective and urgent measures to
help solve the Albanian crisis and prevent it from expanding to a
broader area.
</P>
<P>
The statement, issued by Bulgarian Foreign Ministry on Tuesday
night, said the most important thing for easing the dangerous
situation was to supply urgent humanitarian aid to Albania, with
help from international financial associations while the
diplomatic efforts were underway.
</P>
<P>
The statement said Bulgaria regarded peaceful and democratic
means as the only solution to the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian crisis grew out of public rage over the collapse
of popular, pyramid-type investments in which nearly every
Albanian family lost money.
</P>

The worsening situation in this country has forced the
government to order curfews, roadblocks and declare a state of

<HEADLINE> Monaco Upset Newcastle in UEFA Quarter-final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- French league leaders Monaco moved
one step closer to the UEFA title as they edged England's last
survivors Newcastle United 1-0 on Tuesdasy in their away-match at
St James' Park in the quarter-final first-leg match.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian striker Sonny Anderson scored his fourth goal in the
tournament after 19-year-old Thierry Henry outpaced opponents'
defence and cut the ball back. Anderson scored the only goal of
the match in the 60th minute.
</P>
<P>
The French league leaders had won all three of their previous
away legs against Cracow, Hamburg and Borussia Moenchengladbach.
</P>
<P>
It was only the second home defeat in European comeptitions
for the Newcastle team.
</P>
<P>
Without three star strikers Alan Shearer, Les Ferdinand and
Faustino Asprilla, as well as injury-plagued veteran Peter
Beardsley, Newcastle seemed far from powerful as they used to be.
</P>
<P>
In the other matches of the day, favourites Inter Milan of
Italy earned a 1-1 draw in the away match to Anderlecht of
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
Maurizio Ganz scored a late equaliser after Bruno Versavel had
given Anderlecht a first-half lead with a neat half-volley.
</P>
<P>
Tenerife of Spain, which had gone into the match riding high
on last week's 4-0 league win over powerhouse Barcelona, failed
to revive their momentum and lost to the Danish opponent Brondy
0-1.
</P>
<P>
It was a sad day for the Spanish fans. Valencia also was
whitewashed by Germany's Schalke 04 0-2.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Steel companies seeking to raise
funds by issuing stocks publicly has government support, said Wang
Wanbin, vice minister of Metallurgical Industry.
</P>
<P>
A number of steel ventures were already on the waiting list to
place stocks in the near future, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"It will prove to be a wise choice in the end to hold shares in
steel companies," said Wang, adding that the current malaise of
the steel-making industry, common in a market economy, wouldn't
last.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese steel-making industry has bright prospects given
its advantages in equipment and management personnel," he said.
</P>
<P>
The successful overseas placement of stocks by the Ma'anshan
Steel Company in 1993 has demonstrated worldwide confidence in
China's steel industry, said the senior official.
</P>
<P>
Wang said he believes the to-be-listed steel ventures will
follow the steps of Ma'anshan Steel Company and achieve even
greater success.

<P>
MEXICO CITY, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States could sell
between 3.6 and 5.2 billion U.S. dollars worth of arms to Latin
America over the next five years, a report published here today
says.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel Marcella, an analyst from the University of California,
said Latin American countries would be interested in buying
U.S. arms as their arsenals today were obsolete, dangerous to
operate and expensive to maintain.
</P>
<P>
Marcella, also an adviser to the U.S. army's Southern Command
in the Panama Canal zone, said that last May, the then Secretary
of State, Warren Christopher, and a bipartisan group of 40
U.S. senators expressed their opposition to what they called
"extraordinary restrictions on arms sales".
</P>
<P>
In 1994, U.S. arms sales in the region amounted to only three
percent of U.S exports into the area.

GUANGZHOU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- South China's Guangdong Province

bringing the provincial coverage rate up to 55.9 percent, from
27.2 percent within a decade, and taking the lead in China.
</P>
<P>

BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- China is resettling residents in
flood-prone areas on the lower reaches of the Yellow River,
China's second longest river.
</P>
<P>
Floods present a traditional dilemma for local residents --
they rebuild their houses only to see them destroyed again when
the next flood comes. Last year, two floods damaged 430,000 houses
along with roads, bridges, and telecommunication facilities.
</P>
<P>
So, Shandong Province, which straddles much of the flood-prone
region, plans to move over 280,000 people from over 580 villages
in the endangered areas within three years.
</P>
<P>
Since October of last year, Shandong has evacuated more than
160,000 people to newly-built houses farther away from the
endangered areas. Farmers who have moved to new housing have
expressed their gratitude for the government, saying that they can
start making money again, this time without the fear of a sudden
catastrophe.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Budget Surplus Hits 340 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's 1996/97 (April-March)
budget is expected to experience a surplus of 817.9 billion rupiah
(340 million U.S. dollars), Finance Minister Mar'ie Muhammad said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in a hearing before the House of Representatives
Tuesday, the minister said the 1996/97 budget revenue stands at
95.840 trillion rupiah (one U.S. dollar equals 2,340 rupiah) with
expenditure expected to reach 95.022 trillion rupiah.
</P>
<P>
The budget was originally envisaged to balance at 90.6 trillion
(39.39 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
Mar'ie said the higher-than-estimated revenues were due to the
realization of oil revenues estimated to be 40.7 percent higher
than budgeted.
</P>
<P>
The average price of oil until last month stood at 20.67
dollars per barrel, much higher than the 16.5 dollars per barrel
used as a basis for the budget, he said.
</P>
<P>
Other factors contributing to the higher revenue were the block
sales of share in state-owned telecommunication firm Pt. Telkom,
the conversion of funds from the non-treasury reforestation fund
and government shares in the profit of state companies.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, tax revenues and foreign assistance levels
were expected to be 0.3 percent and 11 percent lower respectively
than targeted.
</P>
<P>
Routine government spending rose 9.7 percent, while payment of
debts was at 9.7 billion dollars, 15.8 percent higher than
planned, because of the government's drive to accelerate the
repayment of high-interest foreign debt, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Total exports in 1996/97 are estimated to reach 52.6 billion
U.S. dollars. showing an increase of 10 percent from the previous
fiscal year," he said, adding that the current account deficit
will be 8.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The minister said imports and services will be at 61.4 billion
U.S. dollars in the 1996/97 budget.
</P>
<P>
He also predicted the country's inflation will settle around an
average of 6 percent in the budget.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia's inflation was 6.47 percent in calendar 1996 as
against 8.64 percent in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said government savings are forecast to reach
23.22 trillion rupiah, up from 22.09 trillion rupiah in the
previous fiscal year.

MANILA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government will
speed up the documentation of some 500,000 illegal Filipino
workers in eastern Malaysia in time for the six-month grace period
set by the Malaysian government before it starts a crackdown on
illegal aliens.
</P>
<P>
The Department of Foreign Affairs said Tuesday that it has

<HEADLINE> Thailand Agrees to Join Information Technology Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has announced its
readiness to join the Information Technology Agreement (ITA) and
will scrap import tariffs on most IT products by 2000 and on the
rest by 2005, according to Krirk-krai Jirabhaet, Thai ambassador
to the World Trade Organization (WTO).
</P>
<P>
Krirk-krai said Tuesday Thailand was able to meet the March 1
deadline for submission of its tariff reduction table, earning it
the right to participate in negotiations on product coverage and
application of non-tariff barriers to protect local industries
under the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The negotiation will last through April 1.
</P>
<P>
Krik-krai was quoted by local press as saying Thailand and
Malaysia had submitted the same conditions for joining the ITA,
with the end date for tariff cuts in 2005.
</P>
<P>
The announcement by Thailand and Malaysia brought the volume of
IT products traded among the participants to 91.3 percent of the
total world trade, only 1.3 percent higher than the minimum
requirement stated in the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The ITA was drafted by the United States, the European Union,
Canada and Japan, calling on the participants to gradually reduce
tariffs to zero by 2000. However, many developing countries
including Thailand wanted a more flexible end date for the tariff
reduction and product coverage.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made last year at a meeting of the 18-member
Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum. It was later transferred
for negotiation at the WTO.
</P>
<P>
WTO representatives spent more than a month in Geneva
negotiating the timeframe before agreeing on the 2005 deadline for
tariff cuts.
</P>
<P>
By Monday, 17 countries and regions had submitted their tariff
cut tables to the WTO. The 17 that met the deadline were Thailand,
Malaysia, Macao, India. Costa Rica, Estonia, Canada, the European
Union, the United States, Japan, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Iceland,
South Korea, Norway, Switzerland and Singapore.

SOFIA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- One was killed and many left
homeless today as a tornado swept across a mountainous region in
southwestern Bulgaria, the state-run BTA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The strong wind also uprooted big trees and caused huge
property damage on its way plowing through the region of Pirin,
which is 1,200 meters above the sea level, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The worst hit was a village called Oshava, where the death toll
was reported. There, all roofs of the houses sheltering the 160
families were ripped off, and dozens of residences destroyed.
</P>
<P>
As most residents of the village are retired workers over 50,
they could not afford to rebuild their houses and some reportedly
had to take shelter in crowded basements.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Apologizes to India for "Unfortunate Error" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
apologized to India for an "unfortunate error" made by Vice
President Al Gore when he used in a letter the word "Khalistan" --
a name not recognized by Washington for India's Punjab region.
</P>
<P>
Gore used the word in a reply to a letter from Gurmit Sinngh
Aulakh, self-styled President of the Council of Khalistan based in
the U.S. capital city of Washington.
</P>
<P>
Gore's letter of February 5 went like this: "Dear Dr. Aulakh:
Thank you for writing to me regarding the ongoing civil conflict
in Khalistan...."
</P>
<P>
At a regular State Department news briefing, spokesman Nicholas
Burns said: "there was an unfortunate error in the preparation of
that letter. And I can tell you that the vice president,
obviously, supports the U.S. policy that Punjab is part of India."
</P>
<P>
The United States has "conveyed to India our regret that this
letter was sent," Burns said. "I think this is a closed matter
which we'll put behind us with the Indian government."
</P>
<P>
The embarrassing foreign policy gaffe over Khalistan has caused
an uproar in India as Gore said in the letter that Aulakh's view
"are very important to us as the president and I formulated
policies to advance the cause of peace around the world."
</P>
<P>
Aulakh, after receiving Gore's letter, said in a statement that
by acknowledging a "civil conflict in Khalistan," the United
States "recognizes the Sikh homeland Punjab as sovereign and
independent."

<HEADLINE> Legislators Call for Unemployment Relief Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Legislators from northeast China's
Liaoning Province, who are attending the Fifth Session of the
Eighth National People's Congress (NPC) here, today called for the
prompt formulation of a law on urban unemployment relief to assist
laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
Chen Suzhi, deputy-director of the Standing Committee of the
Liaoning Provincial People's Congress, said that the unemployment
relief law is needed not only for the smooth growth of a market
economy, but also for protecting the workers' legal rights and
interests and maintaining social stability.
</P>
<P>
As one of China's old industrial bases, Liaoning has more than
1,000 state-owned large and medium-sized enterprises above the
township level, or one tenth of the country's total. There are
approximately one million surplus workers in enterprises that are
are operating on a loss or facing serious financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, with the establishment of the market economic
structure and the deepening of reforms in state-owned enterprises,
a growing number of workers had been laid off. Some of them have
found it rather difficult to make ends meet.
</P>
<P>
"Though the system of minimum life guarantee has been set up in
more than 100 cities across the country, a specific law still
needs to be formulated so as to ensure the basic living conditions
of laid-off workers," Chen noted.
</P>
<P>
The delegation of Liaoning deputies to the current NPC session
has submitted a bill asking for the law's enactment.
</P>
<P>
"With experience accumulated in the past practice of various
places, conditions are basically mature for legislation on the
issue of urban unemployment relief," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
She noted that Liaoning has formulated regulations on urban
unemployment insurance, which have been implemented across the
province and achieved remarkable results.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1996, Liaoning had collected 160 million yuan in
unemployment insurance premium, and paid 580 million yuan. The
province also helped 320,000 laid-off workers to find jobs again.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Amends State-Owned Economic Enterprises Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has amended the State-owned
Economic Enterprises Law to pave the way for the reform and
privatization of state-owned economic enterprises (SEE).
</P>
<P>
According to the new law promulgated Tuesday by the Myanmar
State Law and Order Restoration Council, it allows state
employees' organizations to carry on the SEE with their own
investment without subscribing from state finances.
</P>
<P>
The law states these organizations have the right for perpetual
succession.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar announced in January 1995 to privatize 51 SEE in the
first phase and the process of privatization has been underway in
the form of leasing out the SEE or establishing joint ventures
with local or foreign entrepreneurs or operating either on
buy-back or counter-trade systems.

<HEADLINE> EU to Provide Aid to Bulgaria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA,March 4 (Xinhua) -- The European Union will provide an
emergency free economic aid of 20 million ECUs (22.90 million
U.S.dollars) beginning March to help the Bulgarian government
carry out a social relief program.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador of the European Commission to Bulgaria, Tomas
Salivan, told a press conference that about 1.40 million
Bulgarians would benefit from the aid.
</P>
<P>
Salivan said three-fourths of the money would be used to help
half a million poor Bulgarian families maintain minimum life
levels, and one-fourth would be used to buy food and medicine for
orphanages, hospitals, destitute old people's homes, disabled
centers and other social relief institutions.
</P>
<P>
The EU hoped that from its aid, a retired single man would get
2.4 ECUs (2.74 dollars) a month, a family of two retirees would get
3.6 ECUs (more than 4 dollars) and a poor family with children
under 10 years old would get 5.2 ECUs (6 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian Labor and Social Welfare Ministry said Bulgaria
was talking with the EU about the possibility of getting a loan of
60 million ECUs to help it develop its economy and overcome the
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
But Salivan said the loan would depend on negotiations between
Bulgaria and the International Funds Organization.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Cocoa Output to Reach 400,000 Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's cocoa output is
projected to increase to about 400,000 tons a year by 2000 from
about 310,000 tons this year, according to the Indonesian Cocoa
Association.
</P>
<P>
The association's executive director P.S. Siswoputranto said
here Tuesday at an ASEAN Cocoa Club meeting that the positive
outlook was based on a continued increase in Indonesian cocoa
plantation acreage, sources at the meeting said today.
</P>
<P>
This year Indonesian cocoa production is expected to increase
about 5 percent to 310,000 tons from 295,000 tons last year, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The association's data show that of the 295,000 tons of cocoa
produced last year, 210,000 tons were produced by small holders,
44,000 by state plantations and 33,000 by private estates.
</P>
<P>
Indonesia is now the world's third largest cocoa producer after
Ghana and the Ivory Coast. Malaysia is the region's next biggest
producer with 120,000 tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Siswoputranto said by 2000 ASEAN (Association of Southeast
Asian Nations) cocoa production was projected to increase to
500,000 tons from 464,900 tons in 1995.
</P>
<P>
About 50 representatives from the ASEAN countries are attending
the meeting which aims at identifying problems facing cocoa
production and exchanging information about the industry.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will also look at the possibility of establishing a
common contract for their international trade, said the sources.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Holds Export Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 5 (Xinhua) -- East China Export Fair opened
today in Shanghai, China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
The ten-day fair, now running for the sixth year, is the second
largest regional export fair in the country after the Guangzhou
Export Fair.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 firms from 35 provinces, municipalities and
autonomous regions are in attendance this year.
</P>
<P>
The fair, jointly sponsored by nine provinces, municipalities
and cities in East China, covers an area of 60,000 square meters.
</P>
<P>
Experts expect that the trade volume at this year's fair will
increase over last year's 2.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The fair, experts say, has become a bridge linking the firms
in the East China provinces with their overseas counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Anhui province, for example, saw 25 percent of annual growth of
foreign trade in the eighth Five-Year-Plan period (1990-1995),
much higher than its GDP growth rate during that period.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, according to statistics, the nine sponsors of the fair
completed 23 billion US dollars of foreign trade. In 1996, the figure
increased to 100.4 billion. Their export volume now accounts for
42 percent of the nation's total.

<HEADLINE> Canadian FM Criticizes U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Canadian Foreign Minister Lloyd
Axworthy said here today that the controversial anti-Cuba
Helms-Burton law is causing a "real disruption" in the world
trading system.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy made the remarks at a press conference with United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright. The two countries
are still locked in deep disagreement over the U.S.' anti-Cuba law
which continues to affect bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
American State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said later
the two sides had not narrowed differences over Helms-Burton.
Canada would "stick to its policy of engagement. We're going to
stick to our policy of containment," he said.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy was here to arrange a U.S. visit by the Canadian Prime
Minister, Jean Chretien, early next month.
</P>
<P>
Canada, Mexico and the European Union have been at odds with
the United States over the Cuba issue since the U.S. Congress
passed Helms-Burton last March. The law allows naturalized
Americans to sue, in U.S. courts, foreigners deemed to have
benefited from property confiscated by Cuba since 1959.
</P>
<P>
Facing strong opposition from U.S. allies, United States
President Bill Clinton has twice suspended this section of the
law. However, another section is still in effect, which allows the
U.S. to ban executives, shareholders and representatives from
investing in companies which invest in confiscated property.
</P>
<P>
The European Union took the dispute to the World Trade
Organization (WTO) last year. But last month, Washington said it
would not cooperate with the WTO investigative panel in this case.
</P>
<P>
Axworthy said the U.S. refusal to cooperate with a WTO effort
to adjudicate the disputed law "confirms my own anxiety that
Helms-Burton is causing a real disruption in the larger trading
system."
</P>
<P>
Albright dismissed the differences, saying U.S.-Canadian
relations were in excellent shape. "The strength of our
relationship is overwhelming."
</P>
<P>
"I think we made some headway in a couple of crucial areas,"
she said. "The important thing is to recognize the extent to which
we agree on the goals, which is a democracy or the movement
towards democracy in Cuba."

WARSAW, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Danish Prime Minister Poul
Rasmussen, on a visit to Poland, said here today that Poland will
be invited to participate in a forthcoming conference on NATO's

last year. They signed an agreement under which Denmark will
grant financial aid as well as technical assistance to Poland.

Kwasniewski, Speaker of the Sejm (House of Representatives) Jozef
Zych, and Speaker of the Senate Adam Struzik.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced today
it will grant a loan of 125 million U.S. dollars to Brazil to help
its sub-national economic reform.
</P>
<P>
In Brazil, the sub-national public sector is made up of 26
state governments, a federal district, and 4,300 municipalities.
These provincial entities manage their financial affairs
semi-independently from the national government and account for
about half of the nation's total public expenditure.
</P>
<P>
The announcement said the loan, the first in a series of four,
would help the state of Rio Grande do Sul privatize its
telecommunications company, restructure the state power company,
Companhia Estadual de Engergia Eletrica, and support government
action to award concessions for water and sanitation, ports and
roads.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies Air Views on Reform of State-Owned Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Development of more fund sources
and establishment of a social security system will help China's
ailing state-owned enterprises overcome their difficulties.
</P>
<P>
These are among suggestions put forward by some deputies to the
National People's Congress (NPC) in session here since last
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Deputies from east China's Zhejiang, Fujian and south China's
Hainan offered their views on reform and development of
state-owned enterprises in group meetings discussing Premier Li
Peng's government work report to the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
Chen Wenxian, a deputy from Zhejiang, said lack of capital is a
main obstacle to rejuvenating state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that enterprises seek more fund sources by
introducing investment from overseas and issuing shares at home
and abroad, while improving asset management.
</P>
<P>
His opinion was concurred to by Liu Yuping, a deputy from
Fujian who is the chairman of an electronics company in Xiamen.
</P>
<P>
In his view, there is a lack of clear guidelines that banks
follow for making loan decisions. "Loan policies should be
standardized, and so should be bankruptcy proceedings," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for vigilance against the loss of state assets
through fake bankruptcies.
</P>
<P>
Some deputies from Zhejiang and Hainan proposed that special
concern should be shown to laid-off workers.
</P>
<P>
With the influx of migrant workers into cities, Deputy Wang
Yongming said, city governments should arrange an appropriate
proportion between the employment of migrant workers and
reemployment of the city laid-off.
</P>
<P>
Other deputies stressed the importance of establishing a social
security system to guarantee the basic needs of the unemployed and
alleviate the burdens of state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka Extends Deadline For Surrendering Firearms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's Defense Ministry today
</P>
<P>
extended the amnesty to surrender illegal firearms and
explosives till March 15 following representations by political
party leaders and other organizations, according to the ministry
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The original date to surrender firearms expired Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Search operations have been conducted countrywide jointly by
the police and the army during which 170 firearms have been seized
while about 750 have been surrendered under the amnesty, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The sources noted that about 3,300 more weapons have to be
returned.
</P>
<P>
They said that those in possession of unauthorized firearms
will be charged in court. Under Emergency Regulations, they are
liable to jail sentences, the death penalty and forfeiture of
property.
</P>
<P>
The hunt for firearms follows mounting political violence in
the run-up to the local government elections due on March 21.
</P>
<P>
As many as 590 incidents of election-related violence have been
reported since February 11 when government District MP Nalanda
Ellawala was killed in a clash between government supporters and
supporters of the main opposition United National Party.
</P>
<P>
The unauthorized firearms are those issued to politicians for
their protection by the United National Party during the southern
youth uprising, and not returned after the uprising was suppressed
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that these weapons are being used in the
current spate of political violence.

<HEADLINE> Sabotage Linked to Pakistani Train Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's railway authorities
Tuesday expressed fears that Monday's train derailment may have
been deliberately caused, local newspapers reported today.
</P>
<P>
Eleven railway employees have been suspended in connection with
the train accident which happened early Monday in central
Pakistan, leaving 127 people dead and hundreds injured.
</P>
<P>
The train driver and fireman, who escaped the tragedy unhurt,
have been taken into custody, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The other nine workers including the train guard and examiner
have also been suspended.
</P>
<P>
An inquiry report is expected today to be submitted to
Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
Five cars of the train, which was heading for Pakistan's
southern port city of Karachi, skidded off the tracks early Monday
morning outside the rural station of Mirshah near Khanewal,
northeast of Multan in Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
Passengers were enjoying sound sleep when the train derailed,
which could be one of the reasons for the high death toll.
</P>
<P>
The actual cause of the accident has not been determined so
far, but some reports suggested that some problem in the brake
system of the train may have directly led to the derailment.
</P>
<P>
The train reportedly developed some problem in the brake system
just before approaching the Mirshah Station, which made the driver
unable to stop the train, sources at the Khanewal Station were
quoted as saying.

COLOMBO, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan police have ruled out
the possibility of Sunday's grenade blast in the hill capital of
Nuwara Eliya near Queens Cottage, the official residence of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Calls For Refugee Corridors in Zaire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States on Tuesday
called on Zairian rebel leader Laurent Kabila to open corridors
from Zaire to Rwanda so that Rwandan refugees can return to their
homeland.
</P>
<P>
"We are formally calling today for Mr Laurent Kabila to allow
the opening of these corridors so that innocent people can flee
the fighting," Nicholas Burns of the State Department told a
briefing.
</P>
<P>
There were over a million Rwandan Hutu refugees in eastern
Zaire, who fled their homes after the civil war in Rwanda in
1994. Last December, a great portion of the refugees made their
way back to Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
However, there are still more than 200,000 refugees scattered
in eastern Zaire and unable to return home because of fighting
between the Zairian government troops and Tutsi-led rebels.
</P>
<P>
Burns said State Department refugee coordinator Phyllis Oakley
discussed the situation on Tuesday by telephone with Emma Bonino,
the European Union's humanitarian affairs commissioner. They
agreed the corridors should be opened in order to "contribute
humanitarian assistance to these refugees."

<HEADLINE> President Ramos Arrives in Dhaka on State Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 5 (Xinhua) -- A red carpet reception was accorded
to President Fidel Ramos of the Philippines when he arrived here
this morning on a three-day state visit to Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
Bangladeshi President Justice Shahabuddin Ahmed greeted Ramos
amidst a 21-gun salute at Zia International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The visit, the first by a Philippine president since the
independence of Bangladesh, will be featured by a meeting between
President Ramos and Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina Thursday.
</P>
<P>
They will discuss some concrete proposals for bolstering
Dhaka-Manila ties, particularly in the fields of trade and
economic cooperation, said a Foreign Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Currently the volume of trade between the two countries is at a
low level although Bangladesh enjoys a favorable trade surplus by
exporting jute goods and some traditional items.
</P>
<P>
Ramos, coming to Bangladesh on the second leg of his
three-nation trip to the subcontinent, flew here from New Delhi.
He leaves Dhaka for Islamabad Friday.
</P>
<P>
A big delegation, comprising Foreign Minister Domingo Siazon,
three other ministers and some top traders and industrialists from
the Philippines, is accompanying President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Soon after his arrival, President Ramos is expected to fly to
Savar to pay homage to the martyrs of Bangladesh's liberation war
in 1971. The Philippines is one of the first few countries which
recognized Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> Thai Official Calls for Low-cost Medical Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 5 (Xinhua) -- Thailand should pay more attention
to the development of medical technology to overcome local health
problems, especially that with the cost affordable to the public,
a senior Thai health official said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening ceremony of an international medical
exhibition, Vitura Saengsingkaew, permanent secretary of the Thai
Public Health Ministry, called for application and development of
medical technology which would not make patients heavily depend on
them.
</P>
<P>
Medical technology should be directed at problems with low
cost, safety and less side-effects, he was quoted as saying by
local newspapers.
</P>
<P>
He also stressed that the patients have the rights to know
information about both benefits and side-effects of medical
methods.
</P>
<P>
He noted that expensive and highly-sophisticated medical
technology and equipment, such as computerized tomography
scanners, should be made accessible to all.
</P>
<P>
Currently, medical costs are generally high in Thailand as some
hospitals pay more attention to profits instead of the effects of
medical technology used.

<HEADLINE> Nepal's National Airline Urged to Improve Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 5 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has urged
Royal Nepal Airlines (RNA), the country's national flag carrier,
to improve its management for reversing its loss-making
performance, a senior cabinet member said today.
</P>
<P>
A cabinet meeting last month gave three options to the
airline's management with a view to making the RNA able to compete
under free-market conditions with the participation of private
sector, Finance Minister Ram Sharan Mahat was quoted by the
Kathmandu Post as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the options include giving away the RNA's
management to private sector under contract basis, privatization
and setting up a joint venture with a foreign air carrier.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that his ministry will not support a
deal of two wide-bodied jets for the RNA, proposed by the European
aircraft maker Airbus Industrie, due to the depressing performance
of the airline.
</P>
<P>
The Airbus consortium recently proposed a 200 million U.S.
dollar deal to the RNA for two A-330 jets on a hire-purchase basis
with 60 million dollars of down payment.
</P>
<P>
Under the Airbus proposal, the remaining 140 million dollars
for the deal would be paid with soft credits from Airbus
consortium partner countries after the Nepali government provides
the down payment or necessary guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The government "can't keep on pouring money into the RNA when
it continues adding on losses", the finance minister said.
</P>
<P>
The two A-330s, if hire-purchased, would fly on the airline's
European routes, which have made heavy losses during recent years,
according to airline sources.
</P>
<P>
The latest financial report of the RNA's European operation
showed a net loss of 21.6 million dollars for the period of nearly
two years ending in March 1995, they said.

<HEADLINE> Balanced-Budget Amendment Defeated in US Senate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- In a major setback for
Republicans in the U.S. Congress, the balanced-budget amendment to
the U.S. Constitution was defeated today in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
The vote, 66-34, was one shy of the two-thirds needed to
approve a constitutional amendment in the country.
</P>
<P>
It also marked the third year in a row that the Republicans had
failed to muster the support to pass a cornerstone of their
conservative agenda.
</P>
<P>
The proposed amendment would require a balanced budget by 2002
and every year thereafter, unless the House of Representatives and
the Senate vote otherwise. Exceptions could be made in cases of
war or other military conflict.
</P>
<P>
But Democrats had long since made up their minds to defeat it.
They said the amendment would endanger the Social Security system
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Senate Democratic leader Tom Daschle said today, "A
balanced-budget amendment shouldn't force us to break that
historic contract."
</P>
<P>
Passage by a two-thirds majority was needed to send the measure
to the House, where the amendment has stalled. Approval there
would submit it to the states for ratification.
</P>
<P>
The Republicans have sought its approval for years, and made
it a cornerstone of their major objectives when they took control
of Congress two years ago.
</P>
<P>
A similar amendment cleared the House in 1995 but defeated with
a vote of 66-34. The second vote also failed with a 64-34 vote in
June of 1996.

<P>
LONDON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Major stock markets in Europe all
staged a strong rally and ended sharply higher today, with London

The Paris bourse finished a bullish day only slightly lower

<HEADLINE> US Dollar Grows Stronger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar hit a three-year
high against the mark today, rallying mainly on strong U.S.
economic data, new hints of enlarged German unemployment and more
uncertainty over Europe's launching of single currency.
</P>
<P>
The dollar reached an intraday high of 1.7152 marks, the
strongest since April 1994, before settling in New York at 1.7146
marks, up from 1.6980 Monday and up 13 percent so far for the year.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the U.S. dollar will grow stronger, especially
against the mark, based on the likelihood that interest rates will
rise in the United States but remain static or fall in Germany,
which is suffering from a lackluster economy.
</P>
<P>
The dollar settled at its high for the day at 122.16 yen,
up from 121.27 yen Monday and its first close above 122 yen in six
days. For the year, the dollar is up 5.4 percent against the yen.
</P>
<P>
The pound cost 1.6126 dollars, down from 1.6176 dollars.
</P>
<P>
Demand for the dollar increased on new reports showing
unexpectedly strong housing sales in the U.S. in January and a
surprising surge in the Leading Economic Indicators, the main
forecasting gauge prepared by the Conference Board.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also derived strength from a leaked report that the
number of unemployed German workers hit another postwar high in
February, with 4.671 million people jobless.
</P>
<P>
U.S. February employment data, due Friday, are expected to be
strong.
</P>
<P>
The dollar also grew stronger against other major currencies,
except for the Canadian dollar, in New York.

<HEADLINE> US Decides Not to Cut Off Aid to Albania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States said today
that it will not cut off its aid to Albania despite of latest
developments in the country.
</P>
<P>
"This would not be in the self-interests of the United
States," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told
reporters when referring to suggestions that the U.S. cut off
its aid to Albania.
</P>
<P>
"We have a 27 million U.S. dollar assistance program to
Albania in fiscal year 1997," he said, claiming that all of the
money is directed to building a "democracy" in Albania.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the U.S. spokesman expressed deep concern about the
situation in Albania.
</P>
<P>
"We regret very much that the Albanian authorities are using
the state of emergency to intimidate opposition politicians... to
shut down Voice of America," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Western allies are coordinating their
positions on the issue.
</P>
<P>
"We are working very closely with the Italian government and
with the Greek government... to see if there can be some unified
position... to make sure that we're speaking to the Albanian
government, all of us in the West, with one voice," he affirmed.

<HEADLINE> US Army Lowers Recruit Standard </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Army said today it has
lowered the recruit standard and begun to recruit people who have
not finished high school, as the recruit was hurt by sexual
harassment allegations in the Army and the controversy over a
mysterious Gulf War illness.
</P>
<P>
Publicity about a rash of sexual harassment allegations in the
Army, combined with controversy over a mysterious Gulf War illness
syndrome, has hurt recruiting, Lt. Gen. Frederick Vollrath, the
Army's chief personnel officer said.
</P>
<P>
Besides lowering the standard, Vollrath said, the Army is
offering a range of new financial and other incentives to attract
recruits.
</P>
<P>
Defense Secretary William Cohen, when testifying before
Congress last week, blamed the drop-off in recruit quality on
negative publicity.
</P>
<P>
"Every time you have a bad headline, it impacts recruiting,"
Cohen said. "If we can eliminate those headlines, we can solve the
problem in recruiting."
</P>
<P>
Preliminary figures for the first four months of the 1997
budget year (October 1996-January 1997) show the Army has scored
lowest among the services on two of the three major yardsticks by
which recruit quality is measured, an Associated Press report
said.
</P>
<P>
In that four-month period, 90 percent of the Army's recruits
were holders of high school diplomas, compared with 91 percent for
the Navy, 94 percent for the Marines and 99 percent for the Air
Force.
</P>
<P>
The Army has lowered the recruit standard from having no fewer
than 95 percent high school graduates to 90 percent, which is the
minimum required by the Defense Department for all services.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Army needs to recruit more than two years ago
because of higher drop-offs. Though the Army is not growing in
overall numbers, it needs 89,700 inductees this year, up from
63,000 two years ago.

<HEADLINE> US Manufacturers Criticize Unilateral Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. manufacturers today
criticized the government policy of unilateral economic sanctions
against U.S. companies trading with some countries, saying that it
only costs thousands of American jobs.
</P>
<P>
Unveiling a major new study on the scope and impact of
unilateral sanctions on U.S. companies, President of the U.S.
National Association of Manufacturers Jerry Jasinowski said the
U.S. sanctions are a massive patchwork "with bad results."
</P>
<P>
"Unilateral sanctions are little more than postage stamps we
use to send messages to other countries at the cost of thousands
of American jobs," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "It is difficult to argue that any of the 61 measures
authorized over the past four years have changed the behavior of
the 35 targeted countries."
</P>
<P>
Tracy O'Rourke, CEO and Chairman of Varian Associates Inc, said
that the U.S. government policy of unilateral sanctions "simply
don't work."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press luncheon today, he said that cutting off
American trade and investment in a so-called rogue state "is
sure-fire way to diminish American influence there."
</P>
<P>
"If we are serious about competing in the globe marketplace, we
need to be seen a reliable trading partner," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new study unveiled today was titled "A Catalog of New U.S.
Unilateral Economic Sanctions for Foreign Policy Purposes
1993-1996."
</P>
<P>
It showed that 61 U.S. laws and executive actions were enacted
to authorize unilateral economic sanctions for U.S. foreign policy
purposes in the four-year period of 1993-1996.
</P>
<P>
The sanctioned countries represent 2.3 billion potential
consumers of U.S. goods and services and the export markets
worthing 790 billion dollars.

<HEADLINE> Dow Plunges While Tech Shares Rebound </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Leading technology shares
continued to rebound on Wall Street today, but stocks turned
mostly lower late in the session as interest rates rose again in
the bond market.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 66.20 points, or nearly 1
percent, to 6,858.72.
</P>
<P>
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 margin on
the New York Stock Exchange, with the volume reaching 536.22
million shares, up from 432.68 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock list fell 4.36 to 790.95, and
the NYSE composite index fell 1.66 to 415.68.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index rose 6.20 to 1,317.38, and the
American Stock Exchange composite index rose 2.22 to 597.04.
</P>
<P>
Bonds gave up some early gains after the Commerce Department
reported that January's warm weather in the Northeast and South
helped push sales of new homes to a nearly 11-year high. The 8.6
percent increase from December's tally was stronger than predicted
by economists.
</P>
<P>
And in another report, a private research group said its index
of future economic activity rose 0.3 percent in January, beating
expectations of about 0.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
As bond prices rose and declined for the day, the yield on the
30-year Treasury rose from late Monday's 6.83 percent to 6.68
percent, the highest finish since late January.

<HEADLINE> Report: US Ready to Deploy New Nuclear Bomb </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The United States is ready to
deploy a bunker-busting nuclear bomb that could strike targets
hundreds of meters below the ground, the Defense News weekly
reported in its latest edition.
</P>
<P>
The bomb, called B61-11, was designed to replace the B53 bomb,
which nuclear war planners use to target deeply buried Russian
command and control facilities.
</P>
<P>
The B61-11, which was completed in development in December,
directs the bulk of its energy downward, destroying everything
buried beneath it to depth of 700 meters, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Prior to its development, the best U.S. earth-penetrating
nuclear weapon was the B53, a nine megaton bomb with a force equal
to 9 million tons of TNT, penetrates the earth by creating a
massive crater, rather than the more precise blow the B61-11 is
meant to deliver.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the B53 cannot be carried by the B-2 bomber, and
offers less assurance that it will destroy its target than does
the B61-11, arms experts said.
</P>
<P>
The B61-11 not only can be carried by the B-2, but also can
produce explosions ranging from 300 tons of TNT to more than
300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
It was the first new bomb developed by the Department of Energy
since the end of the Cold War. Independent arms control advocates
warned that the B61-11 could undermine U.S. efforts to reduce
tensions with Russia.
</P>
<P>
Bill Arkin, an arms control consultant, was quoted as saying
that developing a bomb to destroy buried Russian command and
control facilities could be destabilizing.
</P>
<P>
"What that signals to the Russians is far more detrimental than
any gains it makes in deterrence," Arkin said.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Proposes Rome Style for Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 4 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser
Arafat suggested today that the final settlement of the issue of
Jerusalem's status could copy the style of Rome, making the Holy
City to be the twin capitals for Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very important example -- Rome. Rome is the capital
of the Vatican, and it is at the same time the capital of the
Italian government," Arafat told reporters at a news conference at
the National Press Club, Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
"Why not we can repeat the same, capital of two states, the
state of Palestine and Israel? If there is a will, there is a
way," he added.
</P>
<P>
East Jerusalem is the traditionally Arab residential area,
which was captured by Israel during the 1967 Middle East war.
Israel has ever since claimed the city as an undivided entity and
declared that it would be its capital, defying U.N. Security
Council resolutions 252 and 465, which condemned completely the
annexation of the Holy City.
</P>
<P>
Its plan approved last Wednesday by the Israeli government to
build Jewish housing in east Jerusalem has drawn worldwide
criticisms, which called it a violation of the U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said Monday before his talks with U.S. President Bill
Clinton at the White House that Israel's housing project was aimed
"to squeeze and to isolate Jerusalem," which would surely
"torpedo" the peace process in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
He kept on with his condemnations of Israel at today's news
conference, saying, "The last decision to build a new settlement
in Abu Ghehaim Mountain (east Jerusalem) is a real challenge to
the peace process because it will isolate Jerusalem more and more
and more and more, and to separate between Jerusalem and
Bethlehem."
</P>
<P>
He, however, told reporters at the National Press Club that he
would continue to take hard job in pursuing the final peace in the
volatile region.
</P>
<P>
"We have to work hard now to carry on with this very difficult
job," he said. "We have no other alternative. And in spite of the
difficulties, which we are taking, we have one alternative: to
carry on with the peace process."
</P>
<P>
He said he had "very constructive, positive, warm talks" with
Clinton, who gave the Palestinians support by denouncing Israel's
housing project as "building mistrust" between the Israelis and
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"I can't say and I haven't the right to say what he (Clinton)
is going to do, but I am sure he will push forward with all his
capability, with all his capacity, to save the peace process,"
Arafat said.
</P>
<P>
At a State Department regular briefing today, spokesman
Nicholas Burns said the United States was very "disappointed" at
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's intention to go ahead
with the housing project in east Jerusalem withing a couple of
weeks.
</P>
<P>
"We wish this decision had not been taken. There's been an
erosion of trust and confidence. What we need to do right now is
try to build that back up between the Palestinians and the
Israelis," he said.

<HEADLINE> Renault's Layoff Plan Meets With Strong Opposition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The plan to lay off 3,100 workers in
Belgium and 2,764 workers in France by the automaker Renault has
met with strong opposition from France's rightwing as well as
leftwing political parties.
</P>
<P>
French unionists said today that Renault plans to lay off 2,764
workers in its assembly plants and managing offices in France in
1997, after it announced that it will close its Vilvoorde plant
near Brussels where 3,100 workers are employed.
</P>
<P>
While Belgium remains under a state of shock and fury over
Renault's decision, French unions and leftist parties have
expressed solidarity with the Belgians and called for the
scrapping of the plan.
</P>
<P>
First Secretary of the French Socialist Party Lionel Jospin
today asked the French government to intervene to stop Renault's
plan to close the Vilvoorde plant and cut its work force in
France.
</P>
<P>
He said that the "brutal plan" to close Vilvoorde is
"financially, industrially and socially aberrant."
</P>
<P>
The president of the Communist Party group in the French
Senate, Helene Luc, has called for a parliamentary debate over
Renault's decision and re-nationalization of Renault, which now
remains half state-owned and half private.
</P>
<P>
The president of the ruling RPR group in the National Assembly,
Michel Pericard, said that there was no reason for Renault to make
things "so brutal," while other rightwing parliamentarians also
called it brutality.
</P>
<P>
Renault reported a 5 billion franc (1 billion U.S. dollar) loss
in 1996, due to globalization of the auto market and fierce
competition from other European automakers. But French unions
estimate the deficit at 6 billion francs (1.2 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The decision by Renault came at a moment when unemployment
stands at 12.7 percent in France and more than 13 percent in
Belgium, while the average unemployment rate in Europe stands
close to the post-war highs of 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
It also came when Europe is worried that globalization of the
world economy will cause more and more European companies to shift
jobs to countries with cheaper labor costs.

<HEADLINE> Toronto Residents Vote Against Mega-City Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, March 4 (Xinhua) -- The majority of residents in
Toronto and its five municipalities have voted against a mega-city
plan by the provincial government.
</P>
<P>
Results in a plebiscite show 73 percent of Toronto city
residents and an average of 78 percent people in the five
municipalities said NO to the proposed amalgamation, said local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Despite today's results, the Ontario provincial government said
it will go ahead with the merger, though a couple of changes might
be made to its original plan.
</P>
<P>
Merger opponents say that combining Canada's largest city and
its five neighbors into one mega-city of 2.4 million people would
impair democracy, destroy neighborhood, raise taxes and cause a
lot of other ills.
</P>
<P>
But the government argued that the merger would eliminate
duplication of services, cut costs and raise efficiency in
particular.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the province, some 350 municipalities are reported
to be considering merging with their neighboring communities.

<HEADLINE> Otis Elevator Expands Asian Share in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jean-Pierre van Rooy, company president, said that Otis
performed well, in Asia in particular, in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We're confident about the future (in the Asian market)," van
Rooy said, "because accelerated urbanization throughout Asia will
continue to increase demand for our products."
</P>
<P>
The president, who will become chairman of the company on April
1, also said that in Asia China is a very promising market, in
which Otis has already set up four joint ventures in Tianjin,
Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, respectively.
</P>
<P>
From 1990 to 1996, the company's compound annual growth rate in
China exceeded 40 percent, faster than any other region in the
world. Its sales last year reached 300 million U.S. dollars, 20
percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Today, he said, Otis revenues in the Pacific Asia account for
1.6 billion U.S. dollars or nearly 30 percent of the company's
annual revenues.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the secret of its success, van Rooy said that the
company invested 100 million U.S. dollars in product innovation
last year.
</P>
<P>
In July 1996, it announced the release of Odyssey, the world's
first elevator which incorporates horizontal and vertical movement
and can stretch up to 1,000 meters. However, the company is still
looking for a buyer, primarily in Pacific Asia, which has had a
construction boom for the past decade.
</P>
<P>
The company president also listed decentralized management and
strong partnership with local companies as their way to success.
</P>
<P>
Now its products are found in the Ocean Park in Hong Kong,
Eiffel Tower in Paris and Petronas Twin-Towers in Kuala Lumpur,
Malaysia.

The company is also studying prospects of exporting medicines

JERUSALEM -- After the conclusion of the Hebron Agreement
between Israel and the Palestinians in January, signs are
pointing to a recovery of the tourism in this country, Israel
Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted Avraham Rosental, director-general of the
Israeli Hotel Association, as saying that reservations in local
hotels have been up since the implementation of the Hebron
Agreement.
</P>
<P>
Rosental said that after six months of decline in the number
of tourists coming to Israel, tourist operators are suggesting
that the recovery they have been waiting for has finally started.
</P>
<P>
Israel's tourism industry suffered a huge set back in 1996,
due to series of suicide bombing attacks in February and March
and a serious armed confrontation between Israeli soldiers and
Palestinian police in September.
</P>
<P>
Rosental said that the Israeli government and private tourist
operators, as well as the Hotel Association, are carrying out
market promotions in Europe and the United States to attract
tourists.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel and together with the whole Middle East
is a very attractive market for visitors, but, "only a right
peaceful environment will bring more tourists to an area."
