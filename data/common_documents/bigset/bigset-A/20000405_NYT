HERSHISER HAS FOND MEMORIES IN MONTREAL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ It's easy to bag on Olympic Stadium as being a
smoke-filled dungeon in which one feels trapped rather than
comfortable watching a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   But Orel Hershiser actually has nice memories of the Concrete
Fortress, and he'll script another chapter today. The Dodgers
right-hander made his major-league debut here, won his 200th career
game here last year with the Mets, and now makes his first
appearance in his who-woulda-thought-it return to the Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ballpark has significance with me even though people
don't like the ballpark around the industry,'' said Hershiser, who
faces the Expos. ``My last start was against Colorado right before
the strike, and I joked about it how it might be my last start as a
Dodger. Everybody joked, `No way. No way.'''
</P>
<P>
   But there it was, Aug. 7, 1994, the last time Hershiser pitched
for the Dodgers. He threw six innings against Colorado, allowed one
run and won.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, Hershiser said if not for the work stoppage, he may
be in his 18th season with the Dodgers, rather than having spent
the last five years in Cleveland, San Francisco and New York. But
because of the work stoppage, the Dodgers couldn't watch Hershiser
throw during the winter. Therefore, the Dodgers' brass had no
understanding that his health shouldn't be a concern once the labor
strife was settled.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of that season, I looked like a 35-year-old pitcher
with a reconstructed shoulder that would have a pretty solid year
but probably was on the tail end of his career,'' said Hershiser,
41, who's 69-43 in the past five years. ``The philosophy that had
been passed down from Branch Rickey to Al Campanis to Fred Claire
was, `It's better to get rid of a guy one year too early than one
year too late.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing that philosophy and being brought up through this
organization ... so when all of a sudden the equation has you in
the center of it, why should I all of a sudden be surprised that
they're not going to change the rules. And they didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   MILLS, HUNDLEY INJURED: Catcher Todd Hundley and relief pitcher
Alan Mills both were unavailable for Tuesday's game because of
injuries. While Hundley could return today from a slightly strained
medial collateral ligament in his right knee, Mills' ailment
appears to be much more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Mills sprained his right ankle when he stepped on a ball while
jogging in the outfield Monday and could miss as much as two weeks.
Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said the club could decide today
whether to put Mills on the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trainer said it may be a week before he can get on the
mound,'' Johnson said. ``I'll look at both those injuries (today)
really close.''
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers elect to put Mills on the DL, they'll be forced
to decide whether to remain with 12 pitchers or purchase the
contract of outfielder Geronimo Berroa and add him to the roster.
Berroa is in extended spring training as a non-roster player, so
the Dodgers have until Sunday to make a decision.
</P>
<P>
   Hundley tweaked his knee during an at-bat in Monday's game, and
he said it bothered him when he awoke Tuesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   But when asked if he'd be ready to face Bobby Valentine and New
York on Friday, ex-Met Hundley smiled and said: ``Oh, yeah. Believe
me, I already thought about that.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hundley's place, Chad Kreuter made his Dodgers debut and went
2 for 3 Tuesday. &QL;

THE NETS ARE FEELING MARBURY'S SHARP PAIN
</HEADLINE>
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ With fragile playoff hopes and a limping point
guard, the New Jersey Nets came into the MCI Center on Tuesday
night on a survival mission.
</P>
<P>
   When the night was over, their playoff hopes were severely
crippled by the Wizards' 102-93 victory and their marquee player,
Stephon Marbury, was sidelined for two days and possibly the season
with a painful left knee. Marbury will travel with the team to
Indianapolis where they take on the Pacers Wednesday night and he
will have a magnetic resonance imaging test on his
tendinitis-plagued left knee on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's hurting, he will not play back-to-back,'' Nets Coach
Don Casey said. ``If anywhere close to damaged, he will not play. I
will not put him in the game. He's been too good and worked too
hard for this franchise and his teammates to come up lame.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey said Marbury had a sharp pain in the patella tendon area
and had been getting progressively worse. He said that was why the
decision was made to rest Marbury and to proceed with an MRI.
</P>
<P>
   With Orlando's 107-97 victory over San Antonio Tuesday night,
the Nets are now seven games back with eight games to play.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Marbury sat at his locker with his head down and
was barely audible when he spoke to reporters.
</P>
<P>
   During the morning shoot-around, Marbury said that his knee had
made it harder for him to do the things that he is accustomed to
doing.
</P>
<P>
   He made a couple of explosive moves to the basket in the first
half, but Casey said that it wasn't the same Marbury that the team
was used to having. He said Marbury could not play defense well
because of his knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets (31-43) have lost all three games since Marbury's knee
flared up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're struggling,'' said Nets forward Keith Van Horn, who had
24 points. ``We've become dependent on Stephon for certain things.
We're used to going to him for a big part of our game and when
we're not able to do that it's hard for us to adjust.''
</P>
<P>
   Marbury had 13 points on 5-of-14 shooting from the field.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets were also hurting at the other guard spot when Kerry
Kittles banged his knee against another player during the first
half and played just 18 minutes. Kittles was 1 of 6 from the field.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Kittles had his head wrapped in his jersey. When
he emerged he said his knee was a little sore, but it was nothing
that would keep him from playing against the Pacers.
</P>
<P>
   On the hot shooting of Van Horn, who had 17 first-half points,
and Marbury, the Nets were able to take a 10-point lead at the end
of the first quarter. The Wizards (27-47), who had six players in
double figures, managed to cut the lead in half by halftime and
trailed by 54-49 going into the locker room.
</P>
<P>
   With Marbury's knee wearing down, the Nets lost some of their
zip in the second half. The Wizards, on the strength of guard Chris
Whitney's 7-of-11 night shooting from the field and some great help
from the reserves Aaron Williams (15 points) and Richard Hamilton
(13 points), took over the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Nets suffered a major power drain in the fourth quarter,
hitting only 4 of 18 shots from the field.
</P>
<P>
   If it wasn't for center Gheorge Muresan, they would have gone 10
minutes without a field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Muresan made two field goals and then the Nets went 6 minutes 16
minutes before the starting center Evan Eschmeyer hit an
uncontested layup with 1:53 to play. That gave the Wizards a 95-87
lead, making the game out of the Nets' reach.
</P>
<P>
   Muresan, who has missed 20 games this season with injuries and
has been on the injured list three times, was looking to play 10
minutes in each half. Casey allowed him to play eight minutes for
the game, and Muresan gave Casey 8 points. It wasn't nearly enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he played OK,'' Casey said. ``It was fun to see when
Elliot Perry got that steal at the end, Gheorge running down to
finish off. He looked a bit awkward at times, but I thought he did
well.''
</P>
<P>
   It was one of the few bright spots of what turned out to be a
very dim night for the Nets.
</P>
<P>
   General Manager John Nash said that in the last few games of the
season, it will be important for Muresan to get some minutes so the
Nets can assess where he is. The Nets feel that Muresan is better,
physically, than he was when he played in Washington four years
ago.

NEW YORK CITY MURDER RATE RISING, DESPITE POLICE EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Despite a new, aggressive anti-narcotics program and
an increase in quality-of-life summonses, New York City's murder
rate is still running substantially ahead of last year's. From
January through March, there were about 13 percent more killings
than there were in the same period in 1999, Police Department
statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   But police officials said Tuesday that the murder rate began to
decline after March 17, when they put in place a series of measures
focusing on the Bronx, where the number of killings had almost
doubled. And they noted that most other violent crime was down.
</P>
<P>
   The number of murders for all of last year increased 6 percent
over 1998. Since the start of this year, the rate continued to
rise, notwithstanding a $24 million program called Operation Condor
that began in January and is aimed at bringing the murder rate down
by focusing on low-level drug crimes, and a 12 percent increase in
summonses for violations like public urination and drinking. In the
past, a focus on such quality-of-life offenses has been credited
for the record declines in crime during the Giuliani
administration.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials and criminologists could provide few
explanations for the increase in the murder rate, other than a
simple assessment that after the roughly 70 percent drop in overall
reported crime in the last seven years, the numbers had nowhere to
go but up.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers tend to reverse themselves any time they hit an
extreme, whether it is the 2,290 homicides reported in the city in
1990 or the 630 in 1998, said James Alan Fox, the Lipman Professor
of Criminal Justice at Northeastern University. ``It's not
necessarily time for finger pointing,'' he said. ``Police took
credit when crime started coming down probably more than they
deserve, and they're probably getting more blame than they deserve
when it starts going up.''
</P>
<P>
   The statistics released this week show that there were 187
murders from Jan. 1 through March 31, up from 165 during the same
period last year. While the percentage of drug-related murders has
remained fairly constant, the number of people killed indoors is
climbing, suggesting that the focus on drug crimes and low-level
offenses may not meet with the same success that it has in the
past, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the increase in homicides and a small increase in rapes,
overall violent crime dropped 7.5 percent during the first three
months of the year, with citywide declines in robbery, felony
assault, burglary, larceny and car theft, the statistics show.
</P>
<P>
   The rising murder rate has been driven by the sharp increase in
killings in the Bronx, where 61 people were killed in the first
three months of this year, compared with 38 last year, an increase
of 60.5 percent. In response, Garry F. McCarthy, the department's
deputy commissioner for operations, prepared a set of measures on
March 17 to drive the numbers down.
</P>
<P>
   The program included more uniformed officers in violence-prone
areas, increased domestic-violence programs, two new teams of
undercover investigators taken from a federal task force to arrest
those who illegally sell guns, and new training for Bronx officers
on what types of knives they can seize, McCarthy said.
</P>
<P>
   Although 61 percent of the people slain citywide since January
were killed with guns, 22 percent were killed with knives, and the
law covering what kind of knives can be confiscated is complex,
McCarthy said. The Bronx initiatives are also focusing on
marijuana, which McCarthy said had become an increasingly violent
trade. Along with the office of Robert T. Johnson, the Bronx
district attorney, the police are handling marijuana arrests
differently, arresting suspects and putting them through the
courts, rather than issuing appearance tickets.
</P>
<P>
   McCarthy dismissed the statements of other police officials that
criticism of the police and media reports about the Abner Louima
assault and the shooting of Amadou Diallo have made officers
reluctant to seize guns and make other arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The numbers don't support that, because we still have an
increase in arrests and activity, which shows that the cops are
still doing their jobs in spite of the criticism,'' he said.

NEW YORK HIGH COURT UPHOLDS REPEAL OF COMMUTER TAX 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The state's highest court Tuesday upheld the
repeal of New York City's commuter tax for state residents and
ruled that the tax must also be eliminated for out-of-state
commuters _ a double blow to the Giuliani administration that will
cost the city $360 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   The unanimous decision by the state Court of Appeals concludes
more than a year of legal and political struggle that had begun
with both major parties' attempts to influence a legislative
election northwest of the city and that had put Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani in an awkward position in his race for the U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 800,000 people who work in the city but live
elsewhere, the ruling means that they will no longer have to pay
0.45 percent of their income to New York City, a tax in place, in
varying forms, since 1966. The state, which collected the tax for
the city, stopped taking it from the paychecks of New York state
residents when the law went into effect last July 1 but continued
to deduct it from out-of-state commuters' pay. The state's
Department of Taxation and Finance says it must now refund $115
million to 340,000 people, most of them New Jersey residents.
</P>
<P>
   Repeal of the commuter tax had long been a political rallying
cry for suburbanites, but for years their demands went unanswered.
But last year as a special election approached in a state Senate
district in Rockland and Orange counties, Republicans and Democrats
raced to outdo each other in their appeals to suburban voters, and
with dizzying speed, the tax was repealed last May. In that race,
the Republican, Thomas P. Morahan, narrowly won.
</P>
<P>
   The bill that was passed by the Legislature and signed by Gov.
George E. Pataki repealed the tax for in-state commuters but left
it in place for out-of-staters. But the bill also provided that if
that distinction was ruled unconstitutional, as it was Tuesday, the
tax would be repealed entirely. Many lawmakers said at the time
that they knew they were discriminating illegally against
out-of-state commuters but wanted the courts to shoulder the blame
for taking that money from the city.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   About 480,000 New York state residents paid $210 million a year
under the commuter tax. Out-of-staters paid $150 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani complained loudly about the state's actions last
spring, saying that the state had illegally and unfairly deprived
the city of an important source of revenue and that commuters had a
duty to help pay for the services they used while in the city,
everything from police protection to street paving. He said the
repeal was a product of politics ``out of control.''
</P>
<P>
   That view is at odds with many suburban voters, who are
Giuliani's strongest base of support, and his comments last year
could be used against him during his Senate campaign. In fact, the
mayor has had less to say about the commuter tax as the campaign
has heated up, and his response to Tuesday's ruling was muted.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani said he was not surprised by the court's ruling, and,
defending the tax as ``modest,'' said he hoped state lawmakers
would restore it someday. ``This is one of those political
things,'' he said. ``Albany can sometimes be as convoluted as
Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Christie Whitman of New Jersey called the decision ``a
clear-cut victory for the 240,000 New Jerseyans who cross into New
York City to work each day,'' and urged Pataki to speed the
refunding of withheld taxes.
</P>
<P>
   There were no surprises in the court's 7-0 decision, written by
Judge Richard C. Wesley.
</P>
<P>
   The Giuliani administration had sued to challenge the repeal,
saying the state could not alter the city's tax policy without a
request from the city, known as a ``home rule message.'' While that
is generally true, Wesley wrote, a large exception is made where
there is a ``substantial state concern.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, a tax paid only by New York State residents who live
outside New York City is a matter of substantial state concern,''
he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The city contended that state officials were motivated by
politics _ the state Senate race _ and not by a genuine concern
over the underlying policy, voiding the state's claim to a
substantial interest in the issue.
</P>
<P>
   But ``speculation on the political motivation of the
Legislature,'' Wesley wrote, ``would be a slippery and dangerous
slope.''
</P>
<P>
   The states of Connecticut and New Jersey, and residents of both
states, also sued to challenge the repeal law, on the ground that
it discriminated against out-of-state commuters and was
unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The court said the law violated two of the original sections of
the Constitution: the ``privileges and immunities clause,'' which
says, in essence, that states must treat residents of other states
in the same way they treat their own residents; and the ``commerce
clause,'' which says that only Congress may regulate activities
involved in interstate commerce.

PRESS ASKS JUDGE TO MAKE SKAKEL FILE PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HERSZENHORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ A lawyer representing six news organizations
asked a juvenile court judge here Tuesday to unseal all of the
court documents related to the case against Michael C. Skakel, who
is charged with killing his next-door neighbor, Martha Moxley, in
Greenwich in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel, 39, is charged as a juvenile in the case because he was
15 when Moxley, also 15, was killed. Criminal proceedings against
juvenile defendants and all related court records, even the
outcomes of cases, are usually kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   But in March, acting on a motion by the news organizations,
Judge Maureen Dennis agreed to open the court proceedings against
Skakel to the press and the public. She ruled that he no longer
needed the protection of confidentiality and noted that Skakel and
his lawyer supported opening the case.
</P>
<P>
   In a follow-up request Tuesday, David Fein, a lawyer
representing The New York Times, Newsday, The Hartford Courant, The
Advocate of Stamford, The Greenwich Time and The Associated Press
asked Judge Dennis to unseal the case file, including an affidavit
that prosecutors filed to obtain a warrant for Skakel's arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The newspapers are particularly interested in the arrest warrant
affidavit because it outlines the evidence on which the prosecutors
from the state's attorney's office are basing their case, including
allegations that Skakel confessed to killing Moxley to classmates
at a school in Maine for troubled teen-agers. Skakel has denied
that he killed Moxley and has said he never confessed to doing so.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis said she would consider the news organizations' request,
but did not say when she would issue a decision.
</P>
<P>
   At Tuesday's hearing at the state Superior Court complex, the
prosecutor, Jonathan C. Brennan, said he would not object if Dennis
opened the court record to the public, saying that Skakel had
already waived his right to confidentiality as a juvenile
defendant.
</P>
<P>
   Skakel's lawyer, Michael Sherman, also told Dennis that he did
not object to the release of the file, but then said he had grave
concerns about the effect that releasing some of the documents
might have on a future trial.
</P>
<P>
   Sherman said he was most concerned that many of the allegations
outlined in the warrant were attributed to unnamed sources. He
asked Dennis to require the state's attorneys to reveal the names
of those potential witnesses if she decides to make the documents
public. Sherman acknowledged that any statements made by Skakel's
former classmates at the Elan School in Poland Springs, Maine, ,
were of crucial importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements from Elan are the case,'' he said bluntly.
``There is no question about that.''

 RULING PARTY PICKS No. 2 OFFICIAL TO TAKE OVER AS JAPAN PREMIER  
(EDS: Subs to update with governing party nominating Mori to
succeed Obuchi; no pickup; Wednesday in lede cq.) 
(See also JAPAN-OBUCHI-REACT) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Just hours after the cabinet resigned to make way for
his election, the secretary-general of Japan's governing party,
Yoshiro Mori, was nominated Wednesday to replace the ailing prime
minister, Keizo Obuchi, who had a stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Mori, which is expected to be easily ratified
later Wednesday by the parliament, reflected the fulfillment of a
carefully choreographed script by the governing Liberal Democratic
Party to ensure a smooth and quick succession to Obuchi, who still
lies in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Once the choice of Mori is made official, the new prime
minister, a longtime party stalwart, is widely expected to organize
new elections quickly, most likely before Japan plays host to a
summit meeting of the world's leading economic powers, known as the
Group of 8, in the southern province of Okinawa in July.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Mori's selection by the Liberal Democratic
Party represents the near culmination of an extraordinary
transition in Japanese politics, in which news of the
hospitalization of Obuchi early on Sunday was kept from the nation
for 22 hours while party leaders consulted among themselves over
what to do.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the announcement of Obuchi's stroke was made,
late Sunday evening, the succession of events here has been almost
blindingly fast for a country more used to political changes
measured at a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of the succession, however, from the temporary
passing of power to a caretaker prime minister, Mikio Aoki, to the
selection of Mori in backroom consultations between the party's
various factions, has left many Japanese complaining that their
political system is both antiquated and relatively undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was Japan's first prime minister to suffer a
catastrophically incapacitating illness before any transition
arrangements were made, revealing a system badly unprepared for
such an event.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, in a brief statement Wednesday morning, praised Obuchi's
record and promised to follow in his footsteps. ``Mr. Obuchi
challenged many things, including the reconstruction of the
Japanese economy,'' he said. ``My mission is to make sure that we
stay on the path of economic growth.''
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to continue Obuchi's policies, including giving
priority to economic growth, even if that means increases in
government debt.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the party decision, the nation's cabinet
resigned on Tuesday evening at a brief meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is expected to reappoint the cabinet ministers and then to
turn to the onset of government business, including economic
doldrums and scheduled diplomatic meetings.
</P>
<P>
   The party reached its decision on Tuesday but did not announce
it.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, 62, won support by demonstrating a strong loyalty to
Obuchi. Even more useful to him were his close ties to the party's
major coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. Mori's
ratification by the parliament, or Diet, is already considered a
foregone conclusion, since the coalition, led by the Liberal
Democratic Party, has a large majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is a lifelong party operative who, as with Obuchi before
him, gradually rose through the ranks. He was elected to Parliament
in 1969 and was at various times education minister, head of the
party policy council, trade and industry minister and construction
minister. He has twice been secretary general of the Liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the portfolios that typically define the true party
heavyweights, finance minister and foreign minister, have eluded
him. Those gaps in his resume and his reputation for timidity on
policy issues have led many commentators to say they would expect
little innovation under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said Tuesday, however, that by choosing Mori _
a burly, raspy voiced politician not especially known for his
personal popularity or campaigning skills _ the party was taking a
huge risk in national elections.
</P>
<P>
   With tears streaking down his cheeks, the caretaker prime
minister, Mikio Aoki, said Tuesday afternoon that the dissolution
of the government was made ``based on the judgment of the doctors
and from the viewpoint that we should not allow even one moment's
political vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   The news came after persistent reports throughout the day that
Obuchi's condition was steadily worsening and that the prime
minister was brain dead. Aoki denied that, calling himself ``very
upset'' at news organizations for passing on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians close to the transition process and several Japanese
political analysts said Tuesday that the governing party had used
the extraordinary 22-hour news blackout surrounding Obuchi's
hospitalization early Sunday, and the carefully stage-managed
process since, to engineer the selection of Mori as its unopposed
candidate for the succession.
</P>
<P>
   The party has a long history of running things; it has governed
the country alone or in coalitions for all but two and a half years
since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive handling of the news of Obuchi's hospitalization
and the back-room machinations drew renewed criticisms Tuesday from
several quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Mori spoke volumes, political experts said, about
unusual imperatives in Japanese politics _ loyalty to partners and
allies in a crunch _ rather than to the party's immediate political
needs and even, potentially, to its survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that the LDP lacks people who could enjoy
popularity,'' said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor of politics at
Niigata University of International and Information Studies.
``There is Mr. Kono and Mr. Kato, both of whom would probably be
more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, and Koichi Kato, a former
chief Cabinet secretary, were both believed to aspire to the prime
minister's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the LDP is basing its decision on who has a good
relationship with Komeito,'' Ishikawa, a former senior political
correspondent of the daily Asahi Shimbun, said. ``They are not
thinking of the reaction of the people of Japan, and this behavior
is very strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts were describing the Liberal Democratic Party's
choice of Mori on the basis of the New Komeito Party's comfort as a
recipe for electoral difficulties, because the coalition between
the two parties has been deeply unpopular since it was formed last
October. Opinion polls have consistently shown that Japanese voters
disapprove of having a party with religious affiliations in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The new government will have to dissipate growing criticism of
the secretive, seemingly antiquated mechanics of a succession in
which Aoki was allowed to become caretaker merely on the basis of
what he described as a private conversation with Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Further contributing to the image of a process of party barons
meeting in smoke-filled rooms to keep the public in the dark was
the way in which Mori was selected.

BROTHERS ENTER NOT GUILTY PLEAS IN FIERY SACRAMENTO HATE SPREE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By LYNDA GLEDHILL 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Two white supremacist brothers pleaded not guilty
Tuesday to charges of setting last summer's fires at three
Sacramento synagogues and firebombing an area abortion clinic.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Matthew Williams, 32, and James Tyler Williams, 29,
appeared in U.S District Court in Sacramento and were charged with
arson, conspiracy to commit arson, destruction of religious
property and use of fire to commit a felony.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Williams, who has told reporters that he alone is
responsible for the attacks, appeared with his head shaved, a
scraggly beard and narrow mustache. As the charges were read, he
looked around at the crowded courtroom and winked broadly at one
side.
</P>
<P>
   When asked if he had had a chance to consult with his attorney,
Benjamin Williams said sharply, ``Yes, a very brief opportunity.''
He emphatically said ``Yes, I do,'' when asked if he understood the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the younger brother, wearing glasses and neatly
combed hair, looked straight ahead and answered only ``yes'' to the
questions. Both men appeared in dark blue jail uniforms, with their
hands and legs shackled.
</P>
<P>
   They are already being held in a Shasta County jail on charges
of killing a gay couple, Winfield Mowder and Gary Matson. The
prosecutor in that case has said he will seek the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Holley, Benjamin Williams' appointed defense attorney,
said he believes the federal case will proceed before the state
case. He also suggested he may ask for a change of venue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fairly logical that Sacramento would probably be
the worst place to try a case where the issue is the burning of
Sacramento buildings,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holley said he would have preferred if his client had not talked
to the media.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Williams admitted in a November jailhouse interview
with the Sacramento Bee that he shot the men because he believed
their homosexuality violated God's law. He later admitted
responsibility for the arson attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more any criminal defendant says about anything _ that
makes it harder for us to work with him,'' Holley said. ``But
what's been said has been said.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers will meet Friday with U.S. District Judge Garland
Burrell, who presided over the Unabomber trial.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Steven Lapham, the government's lawyer,
refused to comment beyond saying that ``the game is starting.''
</P>
<P>
   The synagogues sustained $1 million in damage during the early
morning attacks on June 18. Only minor damage occurred at the
Sacramento medical clinic, which was hit early July 2. No one was
injured in the incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Matt Friedman of Congregation Beth Shalom, one of the
synagogues attacked, said seeing and hearing the brothers in person
was ``rattling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially the one brother who spoke with arrogance and
contempt in his voice,'' he said. ``That he is unwavering, at least
in his outward demeanor, is disturbing.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman said he wants the trial to be over so the focus can be
moved away from the two men.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to see the emphasis shifted away from them and their
platform, and rather shifted to what goes on at these synagogues
currently,'' he said. ``We continue to serve the Jewish community
and are there as a resource for spiritual well being.''
</P>
<P>
   Also in the courtroom Tuesday was Brian Matson, brother of Gary
Matson, one of the two Redding men the Williams brothers are
accused of shooting to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to remind people that the brothers accused in
the synagogue fires also murdered my brother and one of my best
friends,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, the Assembly Public Safety Committee passed 5 to 1
a bill by Assemblywoman Pat Bates, R-Laguna Niguel, that would
impose a sentence enhancement of up to five years for anyone
causing the burning and destruction of a church, synagogue or other
religious facility.

 CAUTION: MAY CAUSE ACUTE HILARITY  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Honesty in television advertising is good, but
it sure can be scary.
</P>
<P>
   Many new prescription drugs are now advertised on TV, and
federal law requires that the announcers announce the drug's side
effects, which the announcer does, sometimes in such a soothing or
peppy voice that the side effects sound kind of attractive.
</P>
<P>
   ``So ask your doctor about Gorpomax and kiss toenail fungus
goodbye! Side effects occur in fewer than 90 percent of users and
include severe headaches, menstrual pain, minstrel pain, gangrene,
swelling of the eyeballs, ringing in the nose, gas, bloating,
levitation, inability to recall the words to Wilbur Harrison's
``Kansas City,'' uncontrollable urge to operate heavy machinery,
hallucinations, halitosis, mitosis, tennis elbow, paranoia, Donald
Duck speech, blackouts, comas, amnesia, where was I? sagging
kneecaps, road rage, itchy trigger finger, itch in that spot on
your back you can only reach with a garden tool, ambivalence to the
first track on the new Santana CD, runny ears and spontaneous
combustion.''
</P>
<P>
   MY STOCKBROKER, Dot Commuppance, reminds me that the difference
between NASCAR and NASDAQ is that the former has brakes.
</P>
<P>
   And she says to remember that the polite British term for wacko
or absurd is ``dotty.''
</P>
<P>
   HELL NO, because of Mo we won't bestow on Joe no plaque at SFO.
</P>
<P>
   That's the unanimous sentiment, that San Francisco should not
cave in to Joe DiMaggio's Florida attorney Morris Engelberg and
rename SFO or the Bay Bridge after Joltin' Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Joltin' Mo is creating a DiMag backlash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than play baseball for a San Francisco minor league
team,'' says Matt White, ``what did Joe DiMaggio do for San
Francisco? Did he spend time with `disadvantaged' youth? Did he
establish a scholarship for high school athletes? Did he
participate in any civic activities?''
</P>
<P>
   One thing DiMaggio did do was hire a lawyer to educate us as to
how ungrateful we are.
</P>
<P>
   George Markell named a bookshelf in his North Beach apartment,
upon which he keeps his baseball books and his dad's ``Home Run
Champ'' trophy from the 1948 B'nai B'rith softball league in
Cleveland, ``the Joe DiMaggio Memorial Bookshelf'' and says,
``Screw Mo Engelberg.''
</P>
<P>
   SO JOLTIN' MO Engelberg is demanding that the city properly
honor the name of a man who for years allowed himself to be known
throughout the world as Mr. Coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Denno says, ``How about naming one of those view-blocking
pillars at Pac Bell Park the Morris Engelberg Memorial
Obstruction?''
</P>
<P>
   Nah, too subtle.
</P>
<P>
   HONESTY can be useful. Dale Zaret's answering-machine message
is, ``Hi, this is Dale, I can come to the phone right now but I'm
not going to. So please leave your name and number and I'll get
back to you ... eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   And Cuffs Corbett, man about town, notes that the worst thing
you can hear when you place a phone call is, ``Your call is very
important to us ...''
</P>
<P>
   WHOEVER SAID there isn't a dog seat in the house at the Giants'
new ballpark was incorrect, reports Darryl Forman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was at the Yankee game on Saturday and I was in row K, seat
9.''
</P>
<P>
   Man, it's bad karma to sit in that seat and eat a dog.
</P>
<P>
   THE FINAL FOUR, basketball, was great, but maybe at the next big
sports event we can do without the remote TV shots of bars where
patrons feel compelled to hold aloft their beer, never an iced tea
or a BLT, and say, ``Look, I am drinking a beer! Can you believe
how cool I am? And this is not my first frosty one tonight, no way,
Jose! Eat your heart out, girlfriend who dumped me in high school!
Whoo!''
</P>
<P>
   PRESIDENT CLINTON, arguing for normalization of trade relations
with China, used the phrase ``Nothing, zip, zilch, nada, zero.''
</P>
<P>
   This shows two things. One, Clinton is hip, using a hipster
phrase that is only about a decade out of date. You never heard FDR
say that.
</P>
<P>
   Two, it shows how badly we need to expand that list. Those can't
be the only five words for ``nothing.`
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of cliches, how's this for Clinton's official legacy:
``Been there, done that.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HEARSE was parked in front of St. Mary Magdalen Church in
Berkeley, with the funeral's guest of honor in the back.
</P>
<P>
   A meter maid motored up and informed the hearse driver he was
parked in a ``disabled parking'' space. The coffin was taken inside
the church and during the ceremony, the meter maid returned and
issued a $75 parking citation.
</P>
<P>
   Which caused one bystander to wonder, ``How disabled do you have
to be?''
</P>
<P>
   IN THE POST OFFICE at Geary and Parker streets in San Francisco,
Stephen Carlson is mailing a large envelope.
</P>
<P>
   The clerk looks at the address and asks Carlson, ``What does
`OR' mean?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oregon,'' he explains diplomatically.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is Oregon in the United States?'' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   Because if Oregon is outside the local galaxy, there's an
additional space-time continuum delivery charge.

often faced brutal treatment, but one such man, Rudolfo Montiel,
has discovered in recent days that he has international friends to
help him fight his cause. Montiel organized peasants to block roads
after loggers began felling virgin forests around his village in
the mountains north of Acapulco. Last Friday, Amnesty International
declared Montiel, who is now in prison, a prisoner of conscience,
provoking a flood of protest letters to the Mexican authorities.

half-siblings. The legal issue pits their ``right to know'' versus

Midway through one of the weirdest and wildest days in stock market

DODGERS SCORE A PERFECT 10 IN WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL _ Remember, it's the Montreal Expos, it's only two
games and the Dodgers started last season 5-1 before all you know
what broke loose.
</P>
<P>
   That said, there's a reason everyone in the Dodgers clubhouse is
smiling brightly. They are pounding pitchers and have overwhelmed
an excited and supposedly much-improved Montreal club in getting
out to a quick start.
</P>
<P>
   The revamped Dodgers offense scored double-digit runs for the
second straight night and beat the Expos 10-4 Tuesday at Olympic
Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   In two games, the Dodgers scored 20 runs and have 26 hits, and
the only thing that seems to be missing is Shawn Green's bat.
Despite the outpouring of offense, Green has one hit in eight
at-bats. But with the way the club has started, Green also has no
worries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pretty much doing it all myself,'' Green said jokingly.
``When you see guys coming up there hitting the ball hard and not
getting cheap hits, that's a good sign early on. It's huge,
especially early the year. It lets (the pitchers) relax and get
some confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give pitchers run support early in the year, maybe
they go out there and give up a couple of runs and don't worry
about it as much because they're used to seeing runs on the
board.''
</P>
<P>
   A matchup that drew more international media than regular media
was decidedly in favor of the Dodgers' Chan Ho Park. He withstood
early control problems to pitch six innings and ease to a win after
the offense provided seven runs in the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in that inning the Dodgers had seven consecutive hits
before an out was recorded, including a two-run homer by Gary
Sheffield, and knocked out Montreal starter Hideki Irabu.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers' 17 hits matched their highest total of the dark and
dreary '99 season. And last year's club never scored at least 10
runs in back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the lineup has some protection for some guys, and guys
are comfortable,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``We've got
some guys where we can rest other guys and have them fill in, and
I'm going to do that (today). (Chad) Kreuter did a good job filling
in for (Todd) Hundley. It takes 25 guys. That's the fit, and right
now this team is kind of coming together.''
</P>
<P>
   In the opener, it was the middle of the lineup that did the
damage in driving in eight of the 10 runs. While Sheffield did his
part with the homer and a single, the rest of the lineup beat up a
quintet of Montreal pitchers.
</P>
<P>
   Devon White led off the game with a homer and scored twice. Mark
Grudzielanek, Kreuter and Adrian Beltre each had three hits, and
Kevin Elster had two hits. Those five scored seven times.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's very important from both our offense and the
pitching standpoint to start the season this way,'' White said.
</P>
<P>
   The big lead certainly relaxed Park, who sometimes loses his
focus and composure on the mound. That time nearly came in an
erratic second inning when a pair of outs on the basepaths helped
Park escape huge problems, but throughout the night Kreuter made a
few visits to the mound to help Park calm down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to be as positive as possible and pump him up and get
him in the right frame of mind where he's not trying to nibble at
the hitters,'' Kreuter said. ``Make quality pitches and make them
hit the ball and let them make the outs, because his stuff is that
good.'' &QL;

JUDGE WANTS TO `FAST-TRACK' REMEDY PHASE OF MICROSOFT CASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS to retop with 12 new grafs, picking up at `With Jackson
having...' Adds new final graf. Adds byline. New hed.)  
 By JOEL BRINKLEY and STEVE LOHR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The presiding judge in the Microsoft antitrust case, meeting
with lawyers for both sides in Washington on Tuesday, said he
wanted to ``fast track'' the remedy phase of the case and consider
encouraging the litigants to appeal the outcome directly to the
Supreme Court, according to a transcript of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   One day after he issued his judgment that found Microsoft in
broad violation of the nation's antitrust laws, Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson told lawyers for Microsoft and the government:
``What I don't want to do is have caused this thing to drag on
through a number of months of additional proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Microsoft faces the threat of a rising wave of
consumer class-action cases and other private lawsuits.
</P>
<P>
   During the meeting, Jackson laid out a tight schedule for
filings from both parties every 10 or 15 days ``under a genuine
fast track which would enable us to conclude the remedy phase
within 60 days'' of Monday, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Then he added: ``My transcendent objective is to get this thing
before an appellate tribunal _ one or another _ as quickly as
possible because I don't want to disrupt the economy or waste any
more of your or my time on a remedy if it's going to come back
here.''
</P>
<P>
   No decisions were made, and at another point he discussed
possibly bypassing the appeals court and encouraging the Justice
Department to take the case directly to the Supreme Court, under an
obscure law that allows that procedure in antitrust cases of
national importance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be remiss if I didn't tell you that I will be inviting
from the government a motion'' under a specific federal law called
the expedition act, ``to provide for direct review in the Supreme
Court,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for both sides raised questions about the various ideas,
suggesting that they were not sure what the law permitted.
</P>
<P>
   In the remedy phase, the court will decide what penalty, or
remedy, is assigned to Microsoft. Ideas range from moderating the
company's conduct to breaking it up.
</P>
<P>
   The judge issued his verdict on Monday, just 48 hours after
settlement talks broke down. In his conversations with the lawyers
Tuesday, he asked them to give him the last offers each side had
made in the talks, an idea that both sides resisted. David Boies,
the lead government lawyer, noted that offers discussed in
mediation talks are often of a different character than those
offered to a trial judge.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were also concerned about making their last offers
from the settlement talks part of the public record of the trial,
to which Jackson said he would be willing to take them under seal.
</P>
<P>
   No decisions were made, and the lawyers left to discuss the
questions with others at the Justice Department and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   With Jackson having ruled Monday that Microsoft is a
``predatory'' monopolist that repeatedly violated antitrust laws,
private plaintiffs have a far less daunting challenge in suits
already filed _ and in actions being considered by companies that
believe they have suffered from abuse of Microsoft's market power.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is now an awfully big invitation to plaintiffs'
lawyers,'' said John C. Coffee Jr., a professor at the Columbia
University law school. ``We may have reached a point for Microsoft,
as there was in the tobacco cases, that basic attitudes have
shifted, and a powerful defendant is no longer seen as
invulnerable.''
</P>
<P>
   Some of Microsoft's leading rivals, and even its biggest
customers, could bring private suits, according to legal experts.
But they will almost surely hold off, at least until they see what
sanctions the courts approve against Microsoft _ sanctions that
could, among other things, limit its ability to retaliate.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Jackson's judgment was not surprising, after his findings
of fact in Jackson's judgment was not surprising, after his
findings of fact in November sided with the version of the case
presented in court by the Justice Department and 19 states. But
this week's ruling was a crucial step because it means that many of
his findings _ that Microsoft is a monopoly, for example _ may be
accepted as proof by other courts in private suits.
</P>
<P>
   Several companies that could now step forward as plaintiffs sent
witnesses to Jackson's courthouse to testify on behalf of the
government, including Netscape, America Online, Sun Microsystems,
Apple and IBM. In his ruling, Jackson cited all those companies as
having suffered from Microsoft's ``oppressive thumb on the scale of
competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge ruled, for example, that the company used its market
power to defend its monopoly in operating systems, but that it also
illegally tried to monopolize the market for Internet browsing
software. The principal victim of that tactic was Netscape
Communications Corp., the pioneer in the browser market, which was
acquired by America Online in late 1998. That judgment makes it far
easier for America Online to sue for damages.
</P>
<P>
   Because the judge ruled that Microsoft's monopoly power allows
it to overcharge for Windows, the big personal computer makers
including Dell, Compaq, Gateway and IBM could have cause to file
suit. If they won, such judgments could yield hundreds of millions
of dollars each for big PC makers using Windows. The treble damages
in private antitrust cases would cover every PC a company sold over
four years, the statute of limitations in such cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft could find itself in a very tight pincer here, since
these companies could regard it as being in their fiduciary
interest to file private suits,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a
professor at the University of Iowa law school.
</P>
<P>
   Sun Microsystems, lawyers say, is probably the most likely to
file a private suit against Microsoft. It is a bitter head-to-head
competitor of Microsoft and has little to lose. For all the others,
the calculation would be more complicated because they rely in one
way or another on Microsoft's cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the companies named in Jackson's ruling declined to
comment Tuesday on the possibility of private antitrust suits
against Microsoft. Still, an executive at one of the companies
said, ``It is clearly something we will consider, but there has
been no substantive internal discussion of that yet.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   And the companies may decide against suing Microsoft for other
reasons. First, parts of Jackson's legal conclusions _ though not
his findings of fact _ could be reversed on appeal. And second, the
companies may not see it as in their long-term interest to bring
suit against Microsoft, even if they do not fear retaliation from
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks, which makes software for playing multimedia
programming on personal computers, was mentioned by Jackson as
among the targets of Microsoft's tactics. Yet Rob Glaser, chairman
of RealNetworks, said Tuesday that he had no plans to sue.
</P>
<P>
   ``While I think Microsoft has behaved unethically at times and
this judge found that it broke the law, my focus is going to be on
doing everything I can to make sure RealNetworks remains ahead of
Microsoft in our business,'' Glaser said. ``The government was
absolutely right to prosecute Microsoft. But it doesn't make sense
for us.''
</P>
<P>
   But companies are not the only potential litigants. More than
100 class-action suits have already been filed against Microsoft in
two dozen states, nearly all of them in the aftermath of Jackson's
powerfully worded findings of fact last November. Those suits,
legal experts say, were the early starters as plaintiffs' lawyers
jockeyed for leadership positions in what will likely become a
broader class-action assault on Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   More consumer class-action suits are expected, and lawyers
involved in the early cases said that Jackson's rule was a
significant victory in their campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very pleased with the way the government case came
out,'' said Leonard B. Simon, a partner at Milberg Weiss Bershad
Hynes &AMP; Lerach in San Diego, whose firm has brought many prominent
class-action cases. ``This is very good news for the consumer
class-action cases.''
</P>
<P>
   But while the ruling in the government case makes things easier
for private antitrust plaintiffs, it by no means insures that they
will win in court. The consumer class-action suits mainly contend
that Microsoft, as a monopoly, was able to overcharge for its
industry-standard Windows operating system, which run the basic
operations of nearly 90 percent of all personal computers sold
today.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson ruled that Microsoft had the ability to ``price
substantially above the competitive level.'' And in his November
findings, he noted an internal Microsoft pricing study that said
the company could have charged $49 for a retail upgrade from
Windows 95 to Windows 98 but that the company chose to charge $89
instead because it was the ``revenue-maximizing price.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft replies that the numbers cited in the study were
arbitrary numbers, and that it could have also charged far more for
the Windows upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   In the class-action confrontation, Microsoft says it has the
money and the patience to withstand what it regards as an
opportunistic assault on a deep-pocketed corporate target. In
addition, the company's executives express confidence in their
legal position.
</P>
<P>
   ``These class-action cases are just piling on,'' Bill Gates, the
Microsoft chairman, said in an interview over the weekend. ``There
is no economic theory to show that ours was not the aggressive
price for Windows.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, while Jackson's ruling places Microsoft's liability
firmly into the legal record, the class-action suits must still
prove damages _ that is, what impact Microsoft's abuse of its
market power had on consumers. And even the class-action advocates
recognize that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ruling in the government case simplifies our job, but it
does not make it easy,'' said Terry Gross, a lawyer in San
Francisco. ``We're up against one of the most powerful defendants
in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The private litigation promises to be a marathon effort. A group
of seven federal judges, called the Multi-District Litigation
Panel, held a hearing last week in Palm Springs, Calif., on where
to combine all the federal class-action suits. That initial
decision is expected soon. But it is only a starting point.
</P>
<P>
   California is the leader among the states in class-action cases.
The more than two dozen cases filed to date have been consolidated
in the San Francisco Superior Court. &QL;

DAVIS CUP GOING `HOLLYWOOD'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ Alex O'Brien is no slouch when it comes to
professional tennis. He just doesn't carry the same name
recognition as Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras or John McEnroe.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien is part of the world's fifth-ranked doubles team (with
Jared Palmer), but that's not as glamorous as Agassi and Sampras,
who are first and third in the world singles rankings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet O'Brien is excited because he's playing Davis Cup with
Agassi and Sampras, and McEnroe is the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a great atmosphere _ the whole Hollywood
scene,'' O'Brien said. ``We have the No.1 and No.2 singles players
and the top two doubles players. It's pretty amazing. I look at
this team and say, `Wow, I'm part of it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although it won't be official until Thursday's draw, all
indications are Agassi and Sampras will compete in this
quarterfinal tie against the Czech Republic. Competition begins
Friday at the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   Agassi arrived Monday and briefly practiced before practicing
harder on Tuesday. He showed no affects of a sprained ankle he
suffered in last week's Ericsson Open in Key Biscayne, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' Agassi said. ``Everything that I wanted to
do, I did, so it will be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras, who took Monday off after winning the Ericsson,
practiced lightly Tuesday to get used to the hardcourt surface and
the different balls than he used last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to be indoors and not have to deal with the humidity
like in Florida,'' Sampras said. ``I wanted to break a sweat. I'll
hit again Wednesday and Thursday.''
</P>
<P>
   WHY NOT DAVIS CUP? Other sports' international competitions
attract large followings. Soccer's World Cup is the largest, but
golf's Ryder Cup also gets plenty of attention.
</P>
<P>
   The Davis Cup lags behind.
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret why: the schedule. Teams play four rounds spread
over a calendar year. In 2000, for example, the 16 competing
nations began in February _ the week after the Australian Open. The
quarterfinal round is this weekend and the semifinals will be two
weekends in July _ two weeks after Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
   Then it's a long wait to the final in December.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't really work well,'' said Todd Martin, who is
practicing with the U.S. team but likely won't play. ``If we get it
to two points a year rather than four points a year, I think it
would help.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe said he thinks 99 out of 100 people wouldn't know when
the next Davis Cup weekend is or why it's played over a year.
</P>
<P>
   That includes the players.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's not acceptable,'' McEnroe said. ``It still has to
change.''
</P>
<P>
   McEnroe would like to see the tournament held over one week, or
weekend. Or hold it every other year. Or not hold it in an Olympic
year. Anything but the current format.
</P>
<P>
   Sampras thinks a Davis Cup boycott by the world's top players
would cause the International Tennis Federation to examine the
schedule. But he doesn't see that happening.
</P>
<P>
   TICKET UPDATE: A record 20,000 tickets have been sold for the
weekend, including about 11,000 for Friday. The 20,000 is the most
sold in a day since the 1990 Davis Cup final in St. Petersburg,
Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets remain available through the Forum box office or
Ticketmaster. U.S. Tennis Association officials said the Forum is
configured to hold 13,000, but they can raise barrier curtains and
seat 17,000. &QL;

WILLIAM HAMILTON, 61, A TOP POLLSTER FOR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES  
 BY DOUGLAS MARTIN  
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Fla.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   William R. Hamilton, a Democratic political consultant and
pollster who worked in more than 400 election campaigns, including
four for president, died on Saturday at a hospital in Fernandina
Beach, Fla. He was 61 and lived on nearby Amelia Island.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was lung cancer, said David A. Beattie, Hamilton's
partner in the firm of Hamilton Beattie &AMP; Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic pollster Peter D. Hart, in an interview Tuesday,
described Hamilton's entry into the political consulting business
in 1964 as an event that paved the way for a new generation of
polling experts.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, having begun his career at a time when polls were
essentially seen as little more than snapshots of the feelings of
the broad electorate, helped make them strategic tools that allowed
candidates to define and refine messages and pitch them to specific
groups of voters.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton did polling for four Democratic presidential
contenders: Hubert H. Humphrey in 1968, Edmund Muskie in 1972, John
Glenn in 1984 and Bruce Babbitt in 1988. Among the Senate
candidates he worked for were Lloyd Bentsen, Bob Graham, Adlai
Stevenson, Paul Sarbanes and Thomas Eagleton. In one of his last
successful campaigns, in 1998, he helped state Rep. Roy Barnes win
his race for governor of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   He also did strategic surveys for trade organizations and
research institutions. His polls became a basis for the ``Harry and
Louise'' commercials, which the insurance industry used to derail
the Clinton administration's proposal for universal health care.
</P>
<P>
   In a conversation Tuesday, his partner, Beattie, defended those
commercials, saying the polls had shown that President Clinton's
approach was politically untenable and therefore had to be
abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton himself was no stranger to bluntness: In the very first
campaign of his career, he told the client, a Florida politician,
that the effort was hopeless, a practice he followed through the
years whenever he thought the numbers meant failure.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters tend to work for the candidates of only one party, and
Hamilton never veered from working for moderate Democrats or, in
his foreign campaigns (most recently in Denmark and Sweden), their
equivalents.
</P>
<P>
   As president and chairman of the American Association of
Political Consultants, he helped devise and promote a code of
ethics for polling professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``He spent a long career trying to make this an industry,''
Beattie said, ``rather than a disparate group of cowboys doing
their own thing.''
</P>

   Hamilton also had rigorous personal standards when screening
prospective clients, Beattie said, and recently rejected an offer
to do research for the tobacco giant Philip Morris. He quit smoking
about 10 years ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bertram M. Beck, a longtime leader in social work and
for 10 years the head of the Henry Street Settlement in New York
City, died April 3 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in
Manhattan. He was 82, lived on Roosevelt Island and had a vacation
home on Fire Island.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a form of cancer called mesotheliomia, said his
wife, Deborah.
</P>
<P>
   From 1967 to 1977 Beck was the executive director of the Henry
Street Settlement on the Lower East Side, on Henry Street between
Montgomery and Jackson Streets. From 1977 to 1985 he was general
director of the Community Service Society of New York City, which
concentrates on income maintenance, health care, affordable housing
and education for lower-income city residents.
</P>
<P>
   After 1985, he was a dean and held other posts at Fordham
University. At the time of his death, Beck was the special
assistant to Mary Ann Quaranta, the dean of Fordham's Graduate
School of Social Service. He oversaw Fordham's Bertram M. Beck
Institute on Religion and Poverty, which he organized, and which
was named for him several months ago. The institute was established
early in 1999. He also played an important role in establishing
Fordham's managed care institute.
</P>
<P>
   Beck became a professor of social service at Fordham in 1985,
lecturing students on social policy. He was associate dean of the
social service school from 1987 until he retired from that post in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Kronenfeld, the Henry Street Settlement's current
executive director, said, ``Bert was a person who, because he was
creative and generous in spirit, helped to start many important
organizations in the social-welfare field that continue to this
day.''
</P>
<P>
   The organizations that Beck created or helped to create while he
was Henry Street's executive director include the Lower East Side
Family Union, which focuses on the prevention of child abuse, and,
in 1972, the Urban Family Center, at Houston Street and Baruch
Place.
</P>
<P>
   He was also the executive director, from 1965 to 1969, of
Mobilization for Youth, which, Dean Quantana said, brought
``services to try to help the young people of New York City.''
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Beck majored in social science and received
a bachelor's degree from Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio,
and a master's degree from the University of Chicago's School of
Social Service Administration.
</P>
<P>
   In his early professional years, he was a psychiatric case
worker in the Army Air Forces and a caseworker with the Community
Service Society. From 1952 to 1955, he was the director of an
anti-delinquency project for the Children's Bureau of the U.S.
Department of Health, Education and Welfare.
</P>
<P>
   When he became Mobilization for Youth's executive director, he
had gained extensive experience in combating juvenile delinquency.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife, the former Deborah Berman, who is the
executive vice president of the Real Estate Board of New York and
whom he married in 1965, he is survived by two daughters, Rachel
Beck of Washington, D.C., and Melissa Beck of Brooklyn; and two
sisters, Ruth Korn of Manhattan and Alice Simmons of Brookline,
Mass.

SIR ROBERT SAINSBURY, 93, GROCER CHAIN SCION AND ARTS PATRON 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Sir Robert Sainsbury, patron of the arts and a son of
the dynasty that turned a collection of grocery stores into one of
Britain's biggest supermarket chains, died April 2, the company
said. He was 93.
</P>
<P>
   His lifetime spanned an innovative and troubled century, whose
changes in taste and lifestyle Sainsbury turned into opportunity.
As an avid collector of art, he was one of the first to embrace
such iconoclastic artists as the sculptor Henry Moore and the
painter Francis Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the postwar business world, he and his assertive older
brother, Alan, adopted what was then seen as a novel import from
the United States: self-service stores, the forerunner of
supermarkets, which, with wide aisles and checkout areas, offered a
striking contrast to the tiled walls and marble counters of
traditional Sainsbury emporiums.
</P>
<P>
   In the retail trade, Sainsbury was generally viewed as the more
retiring of the two brothers, concentrating on finance,
administration and personnel matters and focusing on improving
working conditions for the staff, complementing the rise of the
postwar state welfare system, which both brothers supported.
Indeed, some thought him too philanthropic.
</P>
<P>
   But in the art world, his collection became legend both for its
range and his knack of acquiring work by artists well before wider
recognition of their talent pushed up prices. He bought the first
two drawings by Alberto Giacometti for 5 pounds each. When he
bought Henry Moore's ``Mother and Child'' in 1933, the 160 pounds
he paid _ then equivalent to $560 or so _ constituted half of the
sculptor's annual earnings at the time. A small bronze by Degas,
bought for a relatively modest sum in Paris in 1938, was estimated
to be worth $10 million in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   He always denied that he saw art as an investment or as a symbol
of status, insisting that he was driven solely by personal taste.
``I look at a work and my stomach tells me I want to have it,
nothing else,'' he once remarked. His wife, Lisa, said that if
people wanted status symbols, ``you'd do much better to buy half a
horse _ or a football team.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert James Sainsbury was born on Oct. 24, 1906, a grandson of
John James Sainsbury, who founded the family's first store at 173
Drury Lane in London in 1869. The dynasty now ranks as one of
Britain's wealthiest and most illustrious, studded with knighthoods
and peerages. The company, first listed on the stock exchange in
1973, owns almost 400 stores and is now embroiled with other
supermarket chains in a price-cutting war led by Wal-Mart.
Sainsbury's son, David, is Lord Sainsbury of Turville, a former
head of the supermarket chain and a junior minister at the
Department of Trade and Industry in Tony Blair's Labor government
</P>
<P>
   After an education at Haileybury College and Cambridge
University, and training as an accountant, Sainsbury joined the
family business in 1930. He and his brother became joint general
managers in 1938 after his father suffered a mild heart attack. He
remained with the company until 1969 when he retired as chairman,
helping steer it through the lean, rationed years of World War II
and to its postwar prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   He was knighted for his service to the arts in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   But it was only in 1973 that his love of the arts was translated
into a permanent institution as he and his wife donated hundreds of
artworks and (PS)3 million to the University of East Anglia, near
Norwich, to found the Sainsbury Center for the Visual Arts, built
to a design by the British architect Norman Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Opened in 1978, the collection now houses about 1,200 works,
ranging from paintings by Picasso and Bacon to art from Africa,
Polynesia and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his wife and son, Sir Robert is survived by two
daughters. A third daughter predeceased him.

SEATTLE POLICE ADMIT THEY WEREN'T READY FOR WTO PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KERY MURAKAMI  
 and KIMBERLY A.C. WILSON  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Seattle police officials have formally acknowledged
that they took too much for granted and were generally overwhelmed
and outmaneuvered by protesters during last fall's World Trade
Organization conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Department's initial planning and staffing were inadequate
for handing the situation that confronted the city,'' concluded a
critical 63-page self-evaluation released by the police department
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made mistakes,'' said Assistant Police Chief Clark Kimerer,
who wrote the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report was given to Interim Chief Herb Johnson, whose
predecessor, Norm Stamper, resigned over the handling of the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   Even though press reports, the city's fire department, the King
County Sheriff's office and information from the FBI warned of
massive protests, police officials placed too much stock in the
belief that the protests that occurred wouldn't happen here.
</P>
<P>
   What plans they had for major protests _ including a ``flying
squad'' of police officers to arrest instigators right off the bat_
were quickly overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Outnumbered, police officers were forced to work long hours
without food or rest. Some, including city Ethics and Elections
Commission chairman Tim Burgess, a former Seattle Police sergeant
who serves on one of three Seattle City Council citizens' panel
reviewing the city's handling of the WTO, believe that led to
isolated incidents of over-reaction against protesters.
</P>
<P>
   Calling it a ``tough self-analysis'' by the police, Mayor Paul
Schell said he hoped the report would begin moving the city past
the controversy surrounding the conference.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged, however, that the report was only a first of
several inquiries into how a conference that was supposed to
showcase Seattle ended up filling downtown with tear gas and
leaving business owners with about $3 million in property damage
and lost sales.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd and riot control consultant hired by Schell is expected
to finish its own review of the police department and the mayor's
office in about three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The City Council is reviewing a number of questions _ including
how the city ended up with a $9 million bill for hosting the event.
That report is not expected until July, and will by no means quell
criticism from some quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The report released Tuesday made pains to praise front-line
police officers and supervisors, saying, ``They quite literally
saved the day.''
</P>
<P>
   The report noted that ``the professionalism and restraint
displayed by police officers, supervisors and commanders on the
`front line' ... was nothing short of outstanding.''
</P>
<P>
   Schell added, ``They have my profound admiration and
gratitude.''
</P>
<P>
   That may improve relations with police officers who were angered
by the lack of breaks, food and equipment during the WTO
conference. But police officials Tuesday barred officers from
speaking publicly about the report.
</P>
<P>
   The report also said the use of tear gas, pepper spray and
rubber pellets against protesters represented a moderate use of
force, and were considered preferable to the alternative _ night
sticks.
</P>
<P>
   John Sellars, director of the Berkeley, Calif.,-based Ruckus
Society, one of the groups involved in the protests, said, ``I
guess we should be counting ourselves as lucky they didn't actually
kill anybody out there, that they didn't resort to using their
firearms.''
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer said he believed police acted responsibility in the
Capitol Hill neighborhood, where residents were caught up in the
tear gas and police violence.
</P>
<P>
   The report contends that police did not chase protesters from
downtown to Capitol Hill, as some in the neighborhood reported, but
were sent to ``shadow and monitor'' protesters and avoid contact
with them.
</P>
<P>
   Police used tear gas and pepper spray not only against
protesters but neighborhood residents. Kimerer said police were
responding to ``serious threats to public order.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, protesters vandalized buildings, and
rocked and blocked a police car.
</P>
<P>
   The report and questions from a press conference focused on the
police preparations for the event.
</P>
<P>
   Retired Assistant Police Chief Ed Joiner, who supervised the
police handling of the conference, said he put too much stock in
Seattle's history of peaceful protest.
</P>
<P>
   The report noted: ``While we needed to think about a new
paradigm of disruptive protest, we relied on our knowledge of past
demonstrations, concluding that the `worst case' would not occur
here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Joiner said, ``it wasn't pretty,'' but he pointed out
the WTO was able to meet and no one was seriously injured during
the protests.
</P>
<P>
   Kimerer said police received ``skeletal, fragmented''
intelligence about the possibility of civil disorder.
</P>
<P>
   A July 7 FBI report warned there was ``a strong indication'' of
major protests at the conference, but concluded there was ``no
credible information'' to suggest there would be ``violence or
significant property damage.''
</P>
<P>
   A subsequent FBI report in mid-November found the ``threat of
violent protest activity directed at the WTO ministerial is low to
medium.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials noted that protesters publicly trained to
``shut down'' the conference. But the report noted it's difficult
to tell rhetoric from reality. Kimerer said even the best
intelligence doesn't provide a ``crystal ball.''
</P>
<P>
   The police department did double the number of officers assigned
to deal with demonstrators, to 400. ``However,'' the report said,
``our general theory did not change: Seattle has enjoyed a history
of peaceful protest; Seattleites do not deface the places where
they live and work; and SPD can handle potential disruptions with
existing resources.''
</P>
<P>
   Police were also hampered by a lack of money.
</P>
<P>
   Internal documents obtained by the Seattle Post-Intelligencer
indicate the city knew as it was preparing for the protests that
the Seattle Host Organization _ a group of corporate leaders
sponsoring the conference _ was having trouble raising $1.5 million
it promised for security costs.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it were raised, the money was likely going to be eaten
by reimbursing businesses at the Washington State Trade and
Convention Center for closing during the conference. The report
noted that Seattle police were reluctant to ask other law
enforcement agencies for help without knowing how they would be
repaid for their time.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, planners thought they had more officers available
than they did.
</P>
<P>
   Their information did not consider officers who had approved
vacations during the week. As a result, police planners reduced the
number of officers assigned to the conference, and officers who
were to relieve line officers were eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that police had little inkling of the tactics
protesters would use. Well-equipped with walkie talkies and police
scanners, protesters were able to maneuver in response to police
actions. For instance, Joiner said, police did not expect
protesters to bar delegates from leaving their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that forced police to reassign the ``flying
squad'' of 30 officers to the convention center. Kimerer said
arresting leaders of the protest may have changed the tone of the
day's events.
</P>
<P>
   The report contended that police were hampered by a city law
barring them from gathering intelligence on Seattle citizens.
Joiner said that prevented police from infiltrating protest groups
to learn their tactics and their plans.
</P>
<P>
   One of the lessons learned, the report noted, was that the
planning and tactics used by protesters may have ushered in a new
era of such actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this day forward, we will use WTO as the model for future
planning,'' Kimerer said.

GLAUS CONCERNED WITH WINS, NOT NUMBERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ In 1999, Troy Glaus hit 29 homers and drove in
79 runs in his first full season in the big leagues at age 22. He
has the baseball world at his feet, but Glaus didn't spend the
offseason patting himself on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked back and said I struggled the entire season,'' he
said. ``We finished in last place. So I look at it as a
disappointing season.''
</P>
<P>
   Glaus is regarded as one of the top up-and-coming third basemen
in all of baseball, so why the sour taste? He insists his numbers
only mean something if the team wins. ``If we win, it means I did
enough,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus would like to improve on last season's .240 batting
average. But don't bother asking him if 30 or 40 homers is a goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think about it,'' he said. ``When (Mark) McGwire hit
70, do you think the next year he thought about hitting 80? When
the year ends, I'll end up with what I end up with. To me, the only
numbers that are important are wins.''
</P>
<P>
   TEST PASSED: Ken Hill passed the first test of the season,
holding the Yankees to two runs and four hits in 5 innings on
Monday night. But for Hill, who went 4-11 last season and was
bothered by arthritis in his right elbow, each start will be a new
test.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy right now,'' Hill said. ``I was able to throw the
way I've thrown throughout my career. I can pitch with anybody if
I'm healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's a big ``if'' and manager Mike Scioscia realizes it.
He will hold Hill to a strict pitch limit and demand Hill be honest
with him if his elbow is hurting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenny's straight up with me,'' Scioscia said. ``The only words
I want to hear after he pitches is `I'm cool,' which means he's all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   BELCHER THROWS: Pitcher Tim Belcher threw 38 pitches over two
innings in a simulated game Tuesday and said he didn't hold back.
Belcher, who is recovering from offseason surgery on his right
elbow, said he expects to make a rehab start late next week.
</P>
<P>
   Belcher went 6-8 with a 6.73 ERA last season before a muscle
tear in the elbow ended his season. Having signed a two-year, $10.2
million contract, Belcher admitted feeling bad about letting the
team down.
</P>
<P>
   ``First and foremost, I have an obligation to myself to perform
to the best of my capabilities,'' he said. ``I feel I owe a debt of
gratitude to (former GM) Billy (Bavasi), TC (former manager Terry
Collins) and everyone involved with bringing me in to this
organization. I got a nice contract and didn't do very well. Those
two guys lost their jobs because of it. I certainly feel
responsible for my 1/25th of that debacle.''
</P>
<P>
   SHORT HOPS: The average cost of a ticket to a major-league
baseball game went up 11.8 percent to $16.67 in 2000, but the
Angels' average ticket remained the same at $13.19. ... During
Belcher's simulated game, coach Orlando Mercado, who was catching
Belcher, got hit underneath his right eye by a bat on Orlando
Palmeiro's follow-through. Part of Mercado's helmet cut into the
skin, causing a gash that resulted in four stitches. ... Pitchers
Ramon Ortiz (small tear in shoulder) and Jarrod Washburn (pulled
muscle in side) will start back-to-back nights at Single-A Lake
Elsinore on rehab assignments. Ortiz, who will pitch Thursday, will
make his season debut five days later on April 11 at Edison Field.
Washburn, who will pitch Friday, is a couple of weeks away from
returning. &QL;

<P>
   TOKYO _ Japan's ruling party acted quickly Wednesday morning to
pick a successor to Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who fell into a
coma on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Party lawmakers selected Yoshiro Mori, who was second to Obuchi
in the party's heirarchy. He has also been its secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament is to vote later Wednesday to elect him prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting his party's choice, Mori bowed to the assembly and
said, ``I am praying together with all our party members for the
quick recovery of Mr. Obuchi.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also looked ahead, saying, ``I have no intention of
delaying structural reforms.'' He is expected to continue Obuchi's
policies including giving priority to economic growth even if it
means increases in government debt.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for the party decision, the nation's cabinet
resigned on Tuesday evening at a brief meeting. Mori is expected to
reappoint the cabinet ministers and then to turn to the onset of
government business, including economic doldrums and scheduled
diplomatic meetings.
</P>
<P>
   He will also have to act soon to set a date for new national
elections, perhaps by summer.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, 62, won support by demonstrating a strong loyalty to
Obuchi. Even more useful to him were his close ties to the party's
major coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. Mori's
ratification by the parliament, or Diet, is already considered a
foregone conclusion, since the coalition, led by the Liberal
Democratic Party, has a large majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is a lifelong party operative who, as with Obuchi before
him, gradually rose through the ranks. He was elected to parliament
in 1969 and at various times was education minister, head of the
party policy council, trade and industry minister and construction
minister. He has twice been secretary general of the Liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the portfolios that typically define the true party
heavyweights, finance minister and foreign minister, have eluded
him. Those gaps in his resume and his reputation for timidity on
policy issues have led many commentators to say they would expect
little innovation under his leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Many commentators said Tuesday, however, that by choosing Mori _
a burly, raspy voiced politician not especially known for his
personal popularity or campaigning skills _ the party was taking a
huge risk in national elections that are widely expected before
summer.
</P>
<P>
   With tears streaking down his cheeks, the caretaker prime
minister, Mikio Aoki, said Tuesday afternoon that the dissolution
of the government was made ``based on the judgment of the doctors
and from the viewpoint that we should not allow even one moment's
political vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   The news came after persistent reports throughout the day that
Obuchi's condition was steadily worsening and that the prime
minister was brain dead. Aoki denied that, calling himself ``very
upset'' at news organizations for passing on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians close to the transition process and several Japanese
political analysts said Tuesday that the governing party had used
the extraordinary 22-hour news blackout surrounding Obuchi's
hospitalization early Sunday, and the carefully stage-managed
process since, to engineer the selection of Mori as its unopposed
candidate for the succession.
</P>
<P>
   The party has a long history of running things; it has governed
the country alone or in coalitions for all but two and a half years
since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive handling of the news of Obuchi's hospitalization
and the back-room machinations drew renewed criticisms Tuesday from
several quarters, with the view that the episode revealed a side of
Japan that was neither altogether modern nor Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Mori speaks volumes, political experts say, about
unusual imperatives in Japanese politics _ loyalty to partners and
allies in a crunch _ rather than to the party's immediate political
needs and even, potentially, to its survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that the LDP lacks people who could enjoy
popularity,'' said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor of politics at
Niigata University of International and Information Studies.
``There is Mr. Kono and Mr. Kato, both of whom would probably be
more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, and Koichi Kato, a former
chief Cabinet secretary, were both believed to aspire to the prime
minister's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP is basing its decision on who has a good relationship
with Komeito,'' Ishikawa, a former senior political correspondent
of the daily Asahi Shimbun, said. ``They are not thinking of the
reaction of the people of Japan, and this behavior is very
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts were describing the Liberal Democratic Party's
choice of Mori on the basis of the New Komeito Party's comfort as a
recipe for electoral difficulties, because the coalition between
the two parties has been deeply unpopular since it was formed last
October. Opinion polls have consistently shown that Japanese voters
disapprove of having a party with religious affiliations in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The new government will have to dissipate growing criticism of
the secretive, seemingly antiquated mechanics of a succession in
which Aoki was allowed to become caretaker merely on the basis of
what he described as a private conversation with Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Further contributing to the image of a process of party barons
meeting in smoke-filled rooms to keep the public in the dark was
the way in which Mori was selected.
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders spoke with almost reverential approval of the
offstage consultations that produced Mr. Mori as Mr. Obuchi's
successor, describing it as a confirmation of the efficiency of the
political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Aoki's reaction to Obuchi's collapse was very tactful,''
said Kozo Watanabe, the deputy speaker of parliament's lower house.
``If he had waited a week or 10 days after Mr. Obuchi collapsed,
somebody else could have raised their hand as a candidate, and
there could be some chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the time Mr. Aoki announced the condition of Mr.
Obuchi, it was already virtually decided who would take over.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for independent politicians and commentators,
and indeed much of the public, the process provided a field day of
introspection about how, 55 years after World War II, Japan has
remained a democracy largely in name, rather than in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of choosing a successor has revealed itself as not
very democratic, and is indeed very closed,'' said Shusei Tanaka, a
political scientist at Fukuyama University in Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that even if the prime minister changes, the
policies won't,'' he said.

STRIKING JANITORS BLOCK TRAFFIC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff Writers Donna Huffaker and Sylvia Oliande contributed to
this story) 
By TROY ANDERSON AND JASON KANDEL 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Escalating their demand for a $1-an-hour raise,
thousands of janitors walked off the job Tuesday in the San
Fernando Valley and downtown, blocking traffic and confronting
replacement workers.
</P>
<P>
   Arm-in-arm, striking janitors tried to block replacement workers
from entering Nestles offices in Glendale, north of downtown, and
DreamWorks SKG studios in Burbank.
</P>
<P>
   Strikers were expected to march about 10 p.m. in the San
Fernando Valley community of Woodland Hills outside Warner Center.
</P>
<P>
   About 8:25 a.m., about 2,500 red-shirted janitors tied up
morning commuters by blocking the northbound Harbor Freeway exit at
Sixth Street near Figueroa Street. They left peacefully when asked
to by police wearing riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles police said no arrests were made, but plans were
made to call in officers from around the city to handle problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``They cooperated with us to the fullest,'' said Los Angeles
police Sgt. Dave Nunez of the Central Division. ``At times, we had
to deploy our units to move them along in the intersections.''
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations came a day after the Service Employees
International Union Local 1877 called a strike of its 8,500
janitors Monday to demand a $1-an-hour wage hike for each of the
next three years. The janitors, who clean office buildings
citywide, now make between $6.80 and $7.80 an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors who hire the janitors are offering them raises of 50
cents an hour for the first year and 40 cents an hour more for the
second and third years.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 700 janitors work in the Valley, according to the
union. Contractors put the number at about 1,500, working in a
cluster mostly in Warner Center and along Ventura Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   The strike is expected to continue Wednesday as janitors march
downtown and throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``The janitors are the first large group to strike in many
years,'' said union spokeswoman Blanca Gallegos. ``I think it's a
sign of the new labor movement. They are willing to go out on the
streets and take bold steps.''
</P>
<P>
   The Teamsters have sanctioned the strike, according to Paul
Mihalow of the Teamsters Joint Council 42. That means Teamsters,
including United Parcel Service delivery drivers, will not cross
picket lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we sanction it, we believe in it,'' said Mihalow,
assistant to joint council President Jim Santangelo.
</P>
<P>
   Contractors who assign janitors said they have hired
replacements and do not expect disruptions in service.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are on their merry way, demonstrating and we are on our
merry way, cleaning,'' said Dick Davis, a bargaining coordinator
representing the janitorial firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, I like all these people,'' Tim Tuttle, owner
of Peerless Building Management, said as his replacement workers
tried to enter the Nestles building in Glendale. ``But we are here
to make sure the buildings get cleaned or we'll lose contracts.''
</P>
<P>
   Jlus Serrato, 32, who works across the street for American
Building Management, said the worker action is worthwhile if it
helps with more pay and benefits.
</P>
<P>
   ``These shoes I have, I bought in a secondhand store,'' said
Serrato, a father of two whose wife, Carmen, works for Peerless.
``These pants, $1.75 in a secondhand store. I don't have any money
for anything. We can't go out for dinner or nothing. There's no
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, the workers also won symbolic support from the Los
Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which voted 3-2 to support the
goals of the janitors, many of whom attended the meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The supervisors called on city building owners and janitorial
contractors to ``accept their responsibility to address the gap
between the rich and the working poor'' by giving them raises.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city and this county are experiencing an unprecedented
economic boom, and there is no reason in the world why people who
sweep our buildings and clean our toilets can't be offered and
given a decent livable wage that lifts them out of poverty,'' said
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, who introduced the motion.
</P>
<P>
   Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said she supported the motion
because her father was a janitor for 28 years. She said she sits on
the board ``only as a result of the kind of actions by the unions
who made sure there were adequate wages for people who were working
in menial jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Supervisors Don Knabe and Michael D. Antonovich voted against
the motion.
</P>
<P>
   Knabe said he thought it was inappropriate to enter into
``somebody else's fight'' when the county is preparing to negotiate
contracts with its own employees.
</P>
<P>
   Antonovich said the vote panders to the unions and interferes
with the collective bargaining process between employers and
employees.
</P>
<P>
   To help those striking, the union has established a $1 million
strike fund, and the county Federation of Labor has set up food
banks for families with breadwinners out of work.

MORE SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS TAKING AND PASSING REGENTS EXAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Students who have learning problems or are
physically handicapped are taking and passing, in greater numbers
than ever before, the Regents exams now being required for high
school graduation, state education officials reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But minority students are still far more likely than white
students to be referred to classes for the learning disabled and
handicapped, known as special education, and to be kept for a
longer part of their days in separate classes, said the annual
report on special education prepared by the State Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   While half of the white special education students spend the
majority of their day mixing with general education students, a
little more than one-third of black students and 40 percent of
Hispanics youngsters did so in the 1998-99 school year, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   Later this month, the Education Department will contact more
than 400 school districts around the state to ask why minority
students account for a far larger percentage of special education
students than in the total student population.
</P>
<P>
   In general, New York City lagged behind the rest of the state in
several categories measured by the Regents. The proportion of
special education students passing the English Regents was far
lower for New York City _ 14 percent compared with 35 percent
statewide. Special education students are not required to pass the
Regents exam to graduate; they may take a less stringent competency
exam.
</P>
<P>
   Last school year, 12,516 special education students, or 58
percent of approximately 21,580 special education students nearing
graduation, took the Regents English exam _ a jump of 118 percent
from the previous year. While the statistics show a smaller
proportion of those taking the tests passed, there were
nevertheless 7,480 who did so, the largest number ever. Two years
ago, 4,400, or 27 percent of the special education students nearing
graduation, took the exam; 3,399 passed.
</P>
<P>
   And more special education students are being integrated into
mainstream classes, said Richard P. Mills, the state education
commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, nearly 45 percent of special education students spent
80 percent or more of each school day in general education classes,
up from 39 percent four years earlier. Over the same period, the
percentage of students in segregated special education classes fell
to 8.9 percent last year from 11.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The curriculum for students who remain in separate special
education classes is more aligned now with the new, tougher Regents
standards than previously, said Lawrence C. Gloeckler, the deputy
commissioner who oversees special education services in the state.
</P>
<P>
   In elementary schools, more than four out of five special
education students in the fourth and eighth grades took the English
and math tests given to general education students for the first
time last year, Mills said.
</P>
<P>
   The gains in performance among special education students _
those who have been classified as having learning disabilities,
emotional problems or severe physical disabilities _ are a result
of more aggressive actions taken by the State Board of Regents in
1996 and implemented by the State Education Department over the
last three years, the report said. The Regents compelled local
school districts to increase the numbers of students placed in
mainstream classes and to align curriculum with that of general
education students.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be that not much was expected of special ed
students,'' Mills said. ``They were not expected to read, to write
or to perform at a higher level. And they certainly were not going
to college.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1998-1999 school year, however, 41 percent of the nearly
15,000 special education students who completed high school went on
to some form of postsecondary education, up from 35 percent two
years earlier, Mills said.

LOCAL INVESTORS, COMPANIES RIDE OUT THE STORM
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Staff Writer Jason Cohn contributed to this story) 
By CHRIS SIEROTY AND JASON TAKENOUCHI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The mood among local investors and publicly traded
companies was calm Tuesday, quite a contrast from Wall Street which
suffered through its most volatile trading day in history.
</P>
<P>
   Elliot Carmen, for example, was at the Charles Schwab office in
Encino on Tuesday to open an account for his son, not to liquidate
his holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I invest for the long term,'' said the school bus driver.
``I'm not in (the market) to buy today and sell today.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Tuesday was a day that no one had seen before. While the
Nasdaq composite index ended the day down ``only'' 74.79 points,
earlier in the day it had slid as much as 574.57 points, or 13
percent, to 3,649.11. The 634-point swing from its high in positive
territory to its low was the biggest ever for the Nasdaq and
followed Monday's 349.15-point drop.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which early in the day was
nearly 200 points in the black, closed down 57.09 points after
falling as much as 504.15 _ or 4.5 percent _ to 10,717.78 earlier.
The day's 700.46-point swing was also a record.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was panic out there for a while,'' said Ross Gerber,
manager of the Woodland Hills office of Sun America Securities.
``The reality was as soon as prices dropped to levels people were
comfortable with they came in and bought.''
</P>
<P>
   Robin Shaw of Sylmar agreed, and said he's still hoping shares
of Microsoft come down to a more comfortable level. Monday's court
ruling against Microsoft is blamed by many analysts as the catalyst
for this week's sell-off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll come in on Microsoft when it hits $60 later this month,''
said Shaw, who stopped by the Schwab office to check his account
before heading to work at the Great Earth Vitamins store at
Panorama City Mall.
</P>
<P>
   While investors were riding out the market's wild swings
Tuesday, it was business as usual for MiniMed Inc., a Los
Angeles-based medical device maker.
</P>
<P>
   MiniMed officials said the company does not discuss the market
or the company's stock price with its employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take a very conservative approach,'' said Deanne Roth,
manager of corporate services. ``It's our policy not to comment on
stock prices and the volatility.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Valley companies have taken a slightly different tack.
</P>
<P>
   At a regular monthly address Monday to his company's employees,
Homestore.com Inc. Chief Financial Officer John Geiske centered on
market volatility and what it means, and does not mean, for the
company based in Thousand Oaks in neighboring Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   Geiske said his address _ transmitted via an internal network to
Homestore.com offices across the country _ tried to alleviate any
concerns employees may have had about market volatility. He said he
emphasized the fact that Homestore.com is in a volatile industry
and that price swings did not mean the company had fundamental
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to make sure people aren't overly sensitive,'' he said.
``It was a very timely discussion, particularly in light of what
happened today.''
</P>
<P>
   The company's stock closed down $5.93 at $40.12 on volume of 1.4
million shares on the Nasdaq exchange.
</P>
<P>
   At Internet World at the Los Angeles Convention Center,
tech-heads from across the nation were more interested in the
latest online wizardry than the action on Wall Street. After all,
the millions of dollars they lost and then gained back during
Tuesday's wild swing was all on paper anyway.
</P>
<P>
   ``Volatility is to be expected,'' said Roger Sawhney, director
of zgraffiti.com. ``There is going to be a shakeout. You are
already seeing that in the (business-to-consumer) space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The market leaders are going to do very well,'' Sawhney added.
</P>
<P>
   Murali Prahalad, director of business development at the
Bethesda, Md.,-based company said, ``Profitability will matter. The
online world is going to look a lot like the off-line world.''
</P>
<P>
   As for today, local brokers expect investors to snap up the
bargains.
</P>
<P>
   After the last couple of days, it becomes ``an opportunity to
get into an issue that you've been waiting to get into,'' said
Gerber.
</P>
<P>
   Richard L. Paler, branch manager of Charles Schwab's Encino
office, said, ``The only thing I expect is it's going to be another
very busy day.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CARLTON THOMPSON  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
PITTSBURGH _ The frigid conditions at Three Rivers Stadium on
Tuesday made it feel more like Christmas Day than opening day.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And to that end, we now know what was waiting under the tree for
Richard Hidalgo, whose mighty bat all but gift-wrapped the Astros'
first victory of the millennium, a 5-2 walk over the Pittsburgh
Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Santa brought Hidalgo a familiar gift _ Pirates righthander
Jason Schmidt, who is perhaps Hidalgo's favorite toy among
major-league pitchers. Hidalgo drove in all five of the Astros'
runs with a double and a grand slam that broke the game open in the
sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God he came,'' Astros second baseman Craig Biggio said
of Hidalgo. ``If Richard didn't play in this game, we would have
been in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the Pirates who had their opening day ruined for
the second night in a row. Mother Nature wiped out Monday's
scheduled opener, and Hidalgo and Co. put a damper on things
Tuesday. Hidalgo's blast over the left-field wall was the first
opening-day grand slam in franchise history.
</P>
<P>
   Shane Reynolds also made a little Astros history, tying J.R.
Richard and Mike Scott with his fifth opening-day pitching
assignment. Reynolds, who is 3-1 with a no-decision in opening-day
starts, worked seven strong innings and allowed six hits, including
John Vander Wal's pinch-hit two-run homer in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Outside of pre-game introductions, a ceremonial first pitch by
Bill Mazeroski and a soulful rendition of the national anthem by
Pittsburgh native Christina Aguilera, the too-little, too-late
homer was all the hometown crowd had to cheer in the final
opening-day game at Three Rivers Stadium, which will be made
obsolete next season by PNC Park.
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if Hidalgo starts a petition to halt plans
for demolishing the 30-year-old multipurpose stadium. Hidalgo has a
.476 lifetime batting average at the Pirates' digs, and he has more
home runs (five) and RBIs (11) at Three Rivers than in any other
opposing yard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked hitting in this ballpark,'' Hidalgo said.
``I see the ball well here.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, who missed the final two months of the 1999 season
because of knee surgery, was 3-for-4 with five RBIs and came within
a triple of hitting for the cycle. His eyes must light up like the
morning sun at the sight of Schmidt, against whom the 24-year-old
outfielder has a career .636 batting average, with three home runs
in just 11 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schmidt throws mostly hard stuff, and Richard likes to hit the
fastball,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   Schmidt's biggest nemesis _ other than Hidalgo _ was his
control, which was a bit out of the ordinary for the 27-year-old
righthander, who averaged 3.5 walks per nine innings last season.
He had six walks in six innings Tuesday, and four of the free
passes led directly to runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Schmidt is not a wild pitcher,'' Dierker said. ``But on a
(cold) night like this, any pitcher can get wild.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker was fortunate not to have that problem with the three
pitchers he sent to the mound. Reynolds and relievers Doug Henry
and Billy Wagner combined for just three walks despite a wind-chill
factor that dipped to 10 by game's end, making the ball slick and
difficult to manipulate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was definitely cold, but everyone had to fight it,'' said
Wagner, who worked a scoreless ninth inning to earn the save.
``It's not often that you're warming up in the eighth inning and it
starts snowing.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to Hidalgo, Schmidt's stormy weather started much
earlier. Schmidt retired the Astros in order in the first inning
but led off the second by walking third baseman Ken Caminiti, who
showed just how good his 36-year-old legs have been feeling by
scoring from first base on Hidalgo's double down the left-field
line.
</P>
<P>
   The Pirates attempted a two-out rally in the bottom of the
second, but their hopes of tying the game on Mike Benjamin's single
to left were gunned down when Bill Spiers threw out Chad Hermansen
at home plate for the final out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Spiers was a late addition to the lineup because of soreness in
center fielder Roger Cedeno's right elbow. Hidalgo moved from left
to center, and Spiers started in left. The move was something of a
gamble by Dierker considering Spiers didn't play a single inning in
the outfield during spring training.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was surprised when they asked me about it, but I told them
that I could handle it,'' Spiers said. ``Making that throw actually
relaxed me, just to get that out of the way. I played out there
enough last year to where it didn't feel strange to be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Biggio, Jeff Bagwell and Caminiti worked Schmidt for walks in
the sixth inning before Hidalgo delivered the punishment. One has
to wonder if Schmidt's concentration was affected by a 12-minute
delay to repair some padding behind the home-plate area. Two of the
walks, not to mention the homer, came after the delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have bothered me,'' Schmidt said, ``but who knows?
The main thing is I didn't throw strikes.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who retired 19 of the 28 batters he faced, lost his
shutout bid with two out in the seventh inning on the 14th
pinch-hit homer of Vander Wal's career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shane was great,'' Dierker said. ``To start on the road and in
this kind of weather, we could have seen the same thing (the
Pirates saw with Schmidt). But he pitched a strong game. If he
would have still had the shutout going, I would have kept him out
there, but I thought that maybe he was getting a little tired.''

INDIANAPOLIS _ It was a vertical leap of faith.
</P>
<P>
   The Flintstones, fresh off a bare-knuckles, ground-assault
affair with Wisconsin in the national semifinals, transformed
themselves into the Jetsons right before the nation's collective
eyes Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Gators wanted to run and jump? A missile-to-missile
war? The Gators wanted to press the pace and raise the rpms?
</P>
<P>
   Sure, we can do that, the Michigan State Spartans emphatically
said with their play in Monday night's NCAA championship game.
</P>
<P>
   The Gators want to launch a few 3s? The Gators want to lean on
their guards? Sure, we'll play that game, too. And the Spartans
went on to an amazing 11-of-22 night from 3-point range while
holding Florida's starting guards scoreless.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was only one championship-caliber team on the floor
tonight,'' Florida guard Teddy Dupay said. ``And it wasn't us.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the Spartans. And in the aftermath of Michigan State's
thorough 89-76 win over Florida, we are reminded that champions can
be measured several ways, but no gauge is more important than
versatility and the ability to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State showed us. In a pair of equally impressive _ if
drastically different _ victories in Indianapolis, Tom Izzo's
Spartans gave us a capsule look at their entire year.
</P>
<P>
   One night, the Spartans played the Neanderthal game, the
Flintstones game. They chugged through the Badgers' ridiculous
scratching, clawing and crawling pace but won easily.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, they beat the alleged best running and
pressing team in the land. They outran and outdefended the Gators
at every turn and won easily.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they ran through our press the way they did,'' Gators
forward Mike Miller said, ``I knew it could be trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Transition scoring in the Spartans' win Monday night was a
stunning 27-4 in MSU's favor. Their 89 points were the most given
up by the Gators all year.
</P>
<P>
   One night, MSU guard Mateen Cleaves played the calm, patient
game. He walked the ball upcourt, surveyed overmatched Wisconsin
and pummeled the opponent toe-to-toe like his name was George
Foreman.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, Cleaves turned into George Jetson. He pulled
all sorts of gadgets out of his game, blasting past overmatched
Florida guards and leaving the Gators' press all shriveled up and
gasping.
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans didn't commit a turnover in Monday night's title
game until they already had built a double-digit lead. They shot
nearly 56 percent. The MSU bench stepped up for 16 points against a
team said to be much deeper. Easy baskets led to wide-open jumpers
and vice versa. The pace was wild, but the Spartans always seemed
to be in control.
</P>
<P>
   ``People forget,'' Izzo said, ``we like to run, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Or not. Whatever it takes.
</P>
<P>
   If the Gators were going to win this championship, there was
only one way they were going to do it _ running, pressing and
hitting 3s.
</P>
<P>
   But the Spartans stormed to the title because they had the
ability to march to the beat of any drum, whether it was the slow
death-march kind of cadence of a Wisconsin or the rolling
double-time beat of a Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``They made us make mistakes we usually don't make,'' Gators
center Udonis Haslem said. ``They got the best of us.''
</P>
<P>
   The Spartans got the best of every team they faced, no matter
the style. That's the true measure of a champion.
</P>
<P>
   That's also the biggest reason you have to believe these
Spartans would have been doing the same dance and holding the same
Sears Trophy even if Cincinnati could have had Kenyon Martin in the
NCAA Tournament or Duke could have escaped the Gators in the East
Regional final.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it would have been fun watching MSU try to exact revenge
in the Final Four against Duke, which ousted the Spartans in the
semifinals last year. And if Florida's Haslem could score 27 points
inside against the Spartans, imagine what Martin might have done.
</P>
<P>
   But no matter, you have to believe this MSU team would have
adapted and conquered.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kind of took it upon ourselves to show that we can run the
same-style game that Florida likes,'' MSU forward Morris Peterson
said. ``Nobody has been able to press us all year, so when they
pressed, we looked at it as something we could take advantage of.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever it takes. It's what the Spartans did all year, and it's
the true measure of a champion.

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Usually, a golfer becomes identified with a
tournament because of unbridled success at the event.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jim Furyk is everybody's annual pick at the Las Vegas
Invitational because of the way he thrives in the desert. Davis
Love III has made the MCI Classic his personal playground. Tiger
Woods is the honorary mayor when he shows up at oh, any tournament
he wants to show up at.
</P>
<P>
   But it's less common that a player becomes well-linked to a
tournament because he hasn't won it.
</P>
<P>
   Such is Greg Norman's notoriety at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   While Norman prefers to remember good times, it is a crowd of
ghosts that jam the memories of fans and even other players as they
prepare for the 2000 edition of the tournament at golf's most
hallowed shrine. This will be Norman's 20th appearance at Augusta
National. It isn't accurate to say that all of the previous 19 have
been disappointing. But with three second-place finishes and three
thirds, there have been more than a few letdowns, collapses, upsets
or all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, it's just a shame that he hasn't won it, because
he's such a great player,'' Woods said Tuesday. ``To win as many
tournaments as he has around the world _ and to be as great a
champion as he's been for a number of years _ all the heartbreaks
he's had in this tournament are a shame.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it's his own doing or other players pulling off shots,
he's been there so many times with a chance to win. It's tough for
me to imagine somebody going through all that and coming back again
and again and putting himself in position to win again without
having won.
</P>
<P>
   ``That, to me, is a credit to the kind of person he is, what
kind of inside he has.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman has never given up the quest for a green jacket. And he
still has that yearning fire inside of him. That in itself is
amazing to some, considering his history at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think of Greg, and you realize he's put himself there _ in
position to win _ so many times, probably 10 or 12 times,'' said
David Duval. ``It's not routine. But it's almost like it's routine.
He's been there a lot. And not to win it ''
</P>
<P>
   Duval shook his head and didn't have to finish the thought. It's
a painful sight. Whether looking back at 1996 when his final-round
78 was one of the most famous meltdowns of all time and let Nick
Faldo slip away with the win, or Larry Mize's 140-foot chip-in in
'87, or last year when Norman simply wasn't quite good enough to
catch Jose Maria Olazabal, no matter what he does, Norman can't
seem to win the prize.
</P>
<P>
   But 2000 is no different than the past 19 years. Norman is back
at the Masters. And he's ready to fire all his bullets again.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want this tournament,'' he said. ``If I thought about
all that (bad times), I'd go crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Norman is facing up to the fact that his chances to win a
Masters are running out. At age 45, he figures he has eight more
major championships _ two years' worth _ before he'll likely be
playing out the string on the regular PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Which brings Norman to one of his favorite subjects, a prodigy
of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   While he is well into the autumn of his career, he is becoming
close friends with 19-year-old fellow Australian Aaron Baddeley.
Norman stops short of calling himself a mentor. He doesn't work
with Baddeley with the physical aspects of the game. But he's there
to answer any question about the mental part of golf and life.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was his age, I was still on a surfboard,'' Norman said.
``I really like his demeanor, his determination and his willingness
to learn and improve. When you want something bad enough, you're
going to do everything in your power to get it. And he's very
willing to ask questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was at my house for that period (during the Florida
swing on tour), anything he wanted to talk about _ from life in
general to management to golf to caddies to girlfriends to getting
married _ we talked about. I was like that when I was a kid. I
would never have any fear of going to ask Jack Nicklaus or Lee
Trevino or Ray Floyd or the CEO of a company for advice. And when I
saw that in Aaron, I knew this kid was going to go a long way.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt that Baddeley already has won the Australian
Open as an amateur at age 18, three months ago. Now he's at
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I've dreamed of doing ever since I started
playing when I was 12 or 13,'' Baddeley said. ``I wanted to play at
Augusta, play in the British Open, play in the PGA and have a
chance to win these events.''
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley proved greatness wasn't far away when he won the
Australian Open _ beating Norman and other notable Australian
players, not to mention a handful of American pros _ to win the
national championship in his home country.
</P>
<P>
   And this week, Baddeley wants to win, despite his
wet-behind-the-ears status. But if he doesn't win, he's rooting for
Norman.
</P>
<P>
   ``My expectations for the week are that if I can focus on one
shot, one hole, one round at a time and then be in contention on
Sunday, I want to win the golf tournament,'' Baddeley said. ``I
remember Tiger said the same thing. He said he was here to win. And
I'm exactly the same way. I don't see the point of entering a golf
tournament if you don't think you can win.''
</P>
<P>
   But if he doesn't, Baddeley is in Norman's corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Greg's come so close so many times here. I want to see him win
the golf tournament,'' Baddeley said. ``He deserves it in a way. It
would be a fitting end to his career for him to win the green
jacket.''
</P>
<P>
   Rest assured both the young and the old of Australia will come
out with guns blazing.

SPORTS COLUMN: A TALL TEXAN MUST LEAD THIS DRIVE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Subs for updating, rewriting throughout) By HARVEY ARATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ As an imported New York Yankee, Roger Clemens
has worked hard to fit into their championship cast, to be himself,
the down-home Texan and hard-throwing Rocket. Now if only Cy Young
will revisit his right arm, and make him whole.
</P>
<P>
   He looked more like himself here on Tuesday night but bad
fielding by the Yankees' B team defense cost him a sixth shutout
inning against the Angels and left him with a no-decision in a
Yankees' 5-3 victory on Bernie Williams' two-run homer in the ninth
inning at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   These things happen, and Clemens wasn't about to complain about
Clay Bellinger's throwing error that set up two unearned runs, and
Ricky Ledee's senseless throw home that put a third run into
scoring position. Not after the way the Yankees pulled him along
through the gates of World Series heaven last October, when a year
of pitching dangerously had quite the climactic ending, even if it
came without the rest of the storybook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to the ring ceremonies when we get back
home,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens redeemed himself against Atlanta for his modest
performance last season (14-10, 4.60 earned run average), or at
least that was the spin on the postseason pitch. He was forgiven
for his excellent impersonation of an aging power pitcher. He
earned the ring. Now comes what could be a trickier process,
deserving a raise.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't talk about next year, and neither do the Yankees, but
it is out there, the belief that George Steinbrenner made an
agreement with Clemens' agents, Randy and Alan Hendricks, to extend
his contract upon acquiring him last spring. Steinbrenner is not
likely to treat two leveraged agents from the powerhouse SFX the
way he would the politicians who are trying to get his commitment
to remain in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Boss has been known to use other methods of
dealing with star players (see Winfield, Dave) who have him backed
into a financial corner but don't meet his level of performance
expectation.
</P>
<P>
   Like any sure-fire Hall of Famer, Clemens has flattering goals
for himself, another 20 victories that would accelerate his pace to
300, from his current 247. But he's also tasted Champagne now, got
high on Yankee success.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've won 20 numerous times and five Cy Youngs,'' he said. ``If
it means 15-15 and having the opportunity to pitch in the World
Series, that overrides any individual achievements.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't awful last season, just not the pitcher selected to
baseball's All Century team. The Yankees sure made their share of
excuses for Clemens. He was trying too hard and he was struggling
with location and pitching to a new set of catchers.
</P>
<P>
   The truth was, as David Cone said, ``We didn't see his good
splitter and slider last year.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily for him, there was never an urgency for the Clemens of
old. Even in the three postseason series, by the time he pitched,
the Yankees had their claws around the opposition's throat. In the
end, that was Cy Young Clemens out there against the Braves, and
his mother, Bess, who suffers from emphysema, traveled to see him
pitch, and back home in Houston, his winter days were filled with
more ``way-to-gos'' than ever.
</P>
<P>
   He hasn't watched the tape of Game 4, because the off-season, he
said, is about family and fatherhood. ``I'm not the Rocket to
them,'' he said of his four children. Then again, they are named
Koby, Kory, Kacy and Kody, so down-home dad very likely has more
invested in Rocket-hood than he lets on.
</P>
<P>
   Cone called him ``the greatest pitcher of our generation,'' and
remarked how strange it was to hear him booed in Boston, in Texas,
and when he struggled in New York. ``It was like he didn't have a
home,'' Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   In Houston last week, Clemens had the whole team out to his
house. Cone has sensed greater comfort and a larger leadership role
for Clemens this spring, and still sees remarkable arm strength for
a 37-year-old pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens struck out seven on Tuesday night. He reached 96 on the
radar gun. It was a good start, but it could get hot and sticky if
he doesn't pitch with a vintage flourish. For one thing, the
Yankees might actually find themselves in a pennant race. For
another, Cone, also 37, and a virtual reservoir of good Yankee
will, could have as good a year, or better, and not get an
invitation to return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing unusual, not that much different than last year,''
Clemens described the spring on the eve of his 2000 debut.
</P>
<P>
   It is different, though. Clemens rode a bandwagon last season,
and took a big bow at the finish. This time around, he has to help
steer. &QL;

HERNANDEZ WOULD BE NICE FIT FOR L.A. GALAXY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRED J. ROBLEDO  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There have been indications in the past week that
Mexican striker Luis Hernandez will be the next foreign allocation
to the Galaxy, but Ivan Gazidis, Major League Soccer's executive
vice president in charge of player acquisitions, remains mum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll have no comment on negotiations with Mexican players,''
Gazidis said Tuesday. ``I want to make sure that the deals we have
as possibilities are not prejudiced, so that that we can bring the
best product to our fans.''
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Gazidis said bringing a Mexican player to Los
Angeles is a high priority. He also said that if it happened, a
player wouldn't be available until May, when the Mexican season
ends.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's name was brought up weeks ago, but he was believed
to be too expensive and courting a career in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Yet three Galaxy officials confirmed last week that Hernandez is
a serious option. Hernandez remains under contract with his Mexican
team, Tigres, for another year, but Tigres apparently could use the
type of transfer fee money Hernandez would command.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, who said months ago he would rather play in Europe
than the MLS, reportedly is starting to rethink his options since
he is not getting the offers in Europe he had hoped for.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez could also use the MLS as a way to get to Europe. The
MLS has served as a good feeder program for European teams. New
England's Joe-Max Moore, San Jose's Eddie Lewis and Tampa Bay's
Frankie Hejduk used the MLS to get overseas. Fourteen current and
former U.S. players are now playing in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Mexico, despite its recent success in past World Cups and
international play, doesn't have a reputation for sending players
to Europe. Rafael Marquez, who plays for Monaco in France, is the
lone Mexican overseas.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Hernandez is a player the Galaxy desperately wants,
and for all the right reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Known for his long flowing blond hair, Hernandez is as instantly
recognizable as former Galaxy (and Mexican) goalie Jorge Campos.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez is so popular in Mexico that he would draw 5,000 to
10,000 more people to the Rose Bowl per game. He's a bigger
attraction than either Campos or Carlos Hermosillo were.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, adored because of his work habits and finishing
skills, would bring instant credibility to the team in the mind of
the knowledgeable fan. He's 32 and in his prime, not one of the
many aging foreign allocations MLS has signed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   And imagine a Galaxy front line of Cobi Jones, Clint Mathis and
Hernandez. There would be some magical nights for those three
speedy forwards.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez gets those kind of goals you don't expect, mostly from
sheer hustle. And he always seems to be in the right place at the
right time because of his deep understanding of the game.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will receive some good news sometime in the next two
months. Mauricio Cienfuegos is close to earning his green card,
which will strip him of his foreign status with the Galaxy.
</P>
<P>
   In the event the Galaxy does acquire Hernandez or another
foreign player through an MLS acquisition, the Galaxy will be free
to seek another foreigner as a discovery player because of
Cienfuegos' new status.
</P>
<P>
   Last season Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid showed his eye for talent
by signing New Zealander Simon Elliott as a foreign discovery
player. Schmid's next foreign discovery player will likely be a
young midfielder or striker. &QL;

YANKEES TOP ANGELS, 5-3 
</HEADLINE>
   By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Serving in a role he hates, Bernie Williams
found himself pacing during Monday's season opener, when a sore
triceps muscle forced him to be the designated hitter. Williams
tried to keep occupied between at-bats, going back and forth to the
clubhouse, but nothing worked and he went hitless in four at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   But Williams somehow found a way to relax on Tuesday night,
hitting two doubles before breaking a tie with a two-run homer in
the ninth inning, as the Yankees edged Anaheim, 5-3, to salvage a
decent performance by Roger Clemens.
</P>
<P>
   The right-hander walked five in seven innings but struck out
seven. All of the three runs he allowed were unearned.
</P>
<P>
   Troy Percival, the Anaheim closer, came on in the ninth inning
and retired the first two batters. Paul O'Neill then pulled a
single through the right side of the infield, bringing Williams to
the plate. Williams had doubled and scored in the fourth and
doubled home a run in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   This time he reached over the plate and slammed a long drive
that curled toward the left-field foul pole. It stayed just inside,
prompting the Yankees' dugout to erupt, with most of the players
raising their arms before spilling out to greet Williams.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera pitched a perfect ninth inning for his second
save in two nights, preserving a victory for Ramiro Mendoza. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Scott Brosius was scratched from the starting lineup after
straining a rib cage muscle during batting practice, and Clay
Bellinger replaced him, making a couple of nice plays in the early
innings to help Clemens through some trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens' first pitch was a fastball high and outside _ something
he did constantly last season, when he seemed to be overthrowing
and losing command in the first two innings. Darin Erstad,
Anaheim's leadoff batter, singled and Adam Kennedy followed with a
single. And as Mo Vaughn struck out, Kennedy stole second. Clemens
walked Tim Salmon, the bases were loaded and it was an instant
replay of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   But Clemens discovered his split-fingered fastball, a weapon he
rarely had at his disposal last season. He struck out Garret
Anderson and Troy Glaus, shouting and raising a fist as he ran off
the field. Clemens continued to get in and out of trouble in the
middle innings, filling the bases with runners, whom the Angels
left stranded. Bellinger fielded a grounder to start a double play
in the second, Vaughn bounced into another double play in the third
and Salmon grounded out with two runners on in the fifth.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens had seven strikeouts, four walks and a 2-0 lead through
five and two-thirds innings. He walked Scott Spiezio, however,
before Bengie Molina topped a bouncer along the third-base line.
Bellinger rushed in, gloved the ball and threw it away. With
runners on second and third, Gary DiSarcina, who had a career
average of .186 against Clemens, singled through the middle to
drive in both runs and tie the score. He took second when Ricky
Ledee missed the cutoff man while throwing home. Erstad singled to
center and the Angels led, 3-2, all the runs unearned.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees tied the score immediately. Derek Jeter singled and
swiped second. O'Neill walked and Williams laced his second double
of the game into the left field, scoring Jeter. The Yankees had
second and third and one out.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Scioscia, the Anaheim manager, elected to intentionally
walk Tino Martinez and then call for Mark Petkovsek _ a
sinkerballer who prompts opposing batters to hit ground balls _ to
face Ledee. Just as Scioscia had hoped, Ledee grounded into a
double play.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels loaded the bases on two broken-bat hits and a two-out
walk in the bottom of the seventh, and the catcher Bengie Molina
grounded slowly toward third; the go-ahead run was coming home. But
Bellinger darted in, barehanded the ball and threw to first to end
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Williams mentioned how much he hates being the designated hitter
as he rests the sore triceps in his right arm. Unable to work off
his nervous energy while playing his position, he rode an exercise
bike and hit off a tee .
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of the Yankees' hitters seemed to be anxious. Facing
Ken Hill on Monday and then Kent Bottenfield on Tuesday night, the
Yankees would patiently wait through pitches and get ahead in the
count, before swinging at some offerings out of the strike zone and
dribbling weak groundouts or lifting popups.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Knoblauch, Jeter, Shane Spencer and others were guilty of
this in the first two games, a trend that manifested itself in the
Yankees' production: They accumulated nine hits in the first 14
innings of this series, winning Monday only because O'Neill and
Spencer smacked home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bottenfield shut out the Yankees for three innings, before
Williams finally charged the offense with one out in the fourth,
reaching out and poking a line drive toward the right-field corner
and sliding into second with a double. Martinez drew a walk, and it
seemed that Bottenfield might escape the jam when Ledee fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   But Bottenfield, who had been challenging the catcher Jorge
Posada with high fastballs in his first at-bat, left one over the
middle of the plate. Posada singled through the middle, allowing
Williams to score with a sweeping slide.
</P>
<P>
   As Hill had done on Monday, Bottenfield drove his pitch count
over 80 by sixth inning, the Yankees forcing the David Wells
lookalike to labor. O'Neill singled sharply off Vaughn's glove
leading off the sixth, and after a fielder's choice left Williams
at first with one out, Martinez smashed a breaking ball toward the
right-field wall. Salmon approached the fence apprehensively and
the ball fell in and ricocheting back toward the infield. Williams
scored easily and Martinez pulled into third with a triple.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees failed to add more runs in the inning, however,
after Ledee and Bellinger both struck out. &QL;

D.A. LEFT OUT AS FEDS, LAPD PROBE RAMPART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GREG GITTRICH AND BETH BARRETT 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ LAPD and federal officials have agreed to set up a
joint task force for possible Rampart Division scandal prosecutions
without the participation of the District Attorney's Office, the
Daily News has learned.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, the strongest indication yet that federal civil
rights prosecutions are likely, is in line with Police Chief
Bernard C. Parks' effort last month to use the U.S. Attorney's
Office as a clearinghouse to make sure statements made by officers
against their will cannot be used against them or other officers.
</P>
<P>
   It was that proposal that prompted District Attorney Gil
Garcetti to accuse Parks of refusing to cooperate with his office _
a charge the chief has denied _ and left relations between police
and local prosecutors fragile.
</P>
<P>
   In the weeks since the controversy erupted, sources close to the
investigation said the District Attorney's Office has taken little
interest in setting up a task force for joint investigation of
possible crimes by Los Angeles Police Department officers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD is involved. The U.S. attorney is involved. The FBI
is involved. The D.A. is not involved. It's the U.S. attorney's
protocol, and the D.A. can get involved at any time,'' said a
senior source close to the new task force.
</P>
<P>
   LAPD Cmdr. David Kalish acknowledged that the task force was
being formed with FBI agents, LAPD detectives and federal
prosecutors with no previous connection to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the team will not have access to statements that
officers made without being given the right to remain silent.
Because officers cannot invoke Fifth Amendment protection in
administrative proceedings, their statements in these matters
cannot become the basis of criminal prosecutions. Neither can
evidence derived as a result of the compelled statements.
</P>
<P>
   One official close to the probe said the role of the District
Attorney's Office has not been determined. ``It hasn't been sorted
out,'' the official remarked.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said she
was unaware of a formal invitation by the U.S. attorney to
participate in the federal ``clean team,'' adding that Garcetti
already has a similar operation in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working very closely with the U.S. attorney, the
attorney general and the LAPD,'' Gibbons said. ``Everyone is
talking and on board.''
</P>
<P>
   However, she said there has been no cross-deputization of
prosecutors, which would be required for members of the district
attorney's staff to work directly on the federal government's clean
team.
</P>
<P>
   She said the district attorney and his deputies remain the
prosecutors of state crimes while the U.S. Attorney's Office deals
with federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said creation of a federal team does not mean the U.S.
attorney is taking over the Rampart corruption investigation, but
only that the federal government is positioning itself for possible
prosecutions under federal law.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish said the LAPD has named seven people so far to
participate with federal officials on the clean team and hopes the
new task force will be up and running within a couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LAPD is totally committed to working with the
representatives of the various agencies in this endeavor,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Garcetti's claim that Parks refused to cooperate with his office
prompted a Police Commission investigation that still is pending.
Parks insisted he was merely trying to set up a clean team with the
U.S. attorney and intended to supply whatever information
Garcetti's staff wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Gibbons said U.S. Attorney Alejandro N. Mayorkas and Garcetti
talk frequently, but that the issue of a joint task force has not
been broached. She described a joint meeting scheduled for Thursday
by federal and state prosecutors as routine.
</P>
<P>
   Mayorkas spokesman Thom Mrozek declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   If district attorney's representatives do not join the task
force, the LAPD will continue to provide them with all the
information they request, Kalish said.
</P>
<P>
   One source, however, said it would be more difficult to run
parallel investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is more efficient if you have one team,'' the source added.
</P>
<P>
   Creation of the new federal task force represents the clearest
sign the federal government is taking a greater interest and role
in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This indicates this is a serious investigation and that they
are handling it professionally,'' said Loyola Law School professor
Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor. ``They're conducting
the investigation in a way that shows they're anticipating there
could be criminal charges down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Essentially the U.S. attorney's protocol calls for a ``clean
team'' and a ``dirty team.''
</P>
<P>
   The dirty team works downtown and is supervised on the LAPD side
by Cmdr. Dan Schatz. All of the evidence of police corruption
starts on the ``dirty'' side, where it is reviewed separately by
teams of LAPD detectives, FBI agents and assistant U.S. attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   (SECOND TAKE FOLLOWS)
</P>
<P>
   Before passing along information to the clean team, assistant
U.S. attorneys on the dirty team remove any evidence that cannot be
legally used to win indictments and convictions. Most notably,
compelled statements made by LAPD officers at administrative
hearings or when being administratively interviewed by their
superiors must be removed or ``cleaned'' from the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The clean team gets only evidence considered legally usable in
prosecutions.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Weisselberg, a law professor at the University of
California at Berkeley, said courts have overturned convictions
because evidence was tainted by compelled testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The best-known reversal for that reason came when the conviction
of Lt. Col. Oliver North, the central figure in the Iran-Contra
scandal of the late 1980s, was struck down.
</P>
<P>
   ``His conviction was overturned because it was determined by the
court that members of the Independent Counsel's Office had not
shown that evidence they introduced against him at trial was free
of statements he made during his immunized congressional
testimony,'' Weisselberg said.

MEETING WITH MARTINEZ RESULTS IN COOL RECEPTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Without hesitation, Alex Rodriguez had the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Detroit, beginning of the '96 season,'' he said. ``Had to have
been 25 degrees.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners shortstop fouled back a Detroit pitch that sent a
vibration through the bat handle to his hands that delivered
fleeting thoughts of relief through amputation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt so bad,'' he said of his coldest moment in a baseball
uniform, ``that I pretended that I had cracked my bat, so I could
walk back to the dugout.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez was stalling until the ache went away. He brushed off
the batboy's offerings, went all the way to the bat rack and stuck
in his bat, then pulled it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a long walk to the dugout, too,'' he said. ``I needed
every second.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Tennyson alleged that spring is when a young man's
fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love, he never had to turn on an
0-2 forkball with a frozen tree branch.
</P>
<P>
   That is what awaits the new generation of Mariners players in
Seattle, where the game has gone cold.
</P>
<P>
   Yet despite his Detroit experience and his Miami roots,
Rodriguez is cool about baseball frigidity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, I don't mind it,'' he said. ``I take it as a personal
challenge. I take a lot of pride in playing well when conditions
are bad. The weather can affect some guys. They don't want to play
as much. Maybe I can take advantage if they aren't as prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   A stalwart sentiment, but one that really didn't get tested
Tuesday night. Owing to the facts that it was the season opener as
well as a matchup of the two most successful pitchers in the
American League over the last half-decade, everyone at the Guilty
Pleasure was on high alert.
</P>
<P>
   Adrenaline is a wonderful source of warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Mariners, neither body fluids nor muscles
were worth anything against Pedro Martinez, who shut down the party
Tuesday night faster than a SWAT team. His two-hit, 2-0 stuffing of
the Mariners was, as form charts go, dead-on.
</P>
<P>
   Neither he nor Jamie Moyer, the Mariners' almost equally
effective starter, were bothered by the chill. As Mariners pitching
coach Bryan Price put it afterward, ``I never worry about that for
starters. The pitcher and catcher are the only two people in the
park who are warm.''
</P>
<P>
   For an April evening alongside Puget Sound, it probably doesn't
get any better. Tuesday night was beach weather _ 50 degrees at
game time, with a breeze from the north and a mix of sun and
clouds.
</P>
<P>
   OK, beach weather for an orca. Still, it could have been worse.
And it will be _ start time was two hours earlier than normal,
thanks to national TV. Team management was so twitchy about a
momentary pregame sprinkle spoiling the evening that the roof was
closed despite the absence of a real weather threat.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the roof closed, there's a noticeable temperature change,
maybe 10 or 12 degrees,'' said Rodriguez, who failed to cite even
Harry Wappler as a meteorological source for his observation. But
after one magazine called him the most powerful man in baseball,
who's to argue?
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, you can start to work up a sweat after the roof
closes,'' he said. ``But I don't know that they would do that for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   The deployment of the roof this spring will be a nightly debate.
Other than the no-brainer of steady rain, the iffy weather creates
an esthetics vs. comfort argument.
</P>
<P>
   The massive gray carport has no appeal, but if Rodriguez's inner
Doppler is right, fans might jump on the side of the players,
especially if the joint keeps running out of coffee, as was the
prevailing contention along the concourses. (A Seattle business
that runs out of coffee is a Seattle business flirting with being
run out of town.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, in no case will Seattle encounter what Lou Piniella
recalled as his worst cold-weather episode.
</P>
<P>
   ``The blizzard of '82,'' he said, when the season's first four
games in Yankee Stadium _ two against Texas and two against the
Chicago White Sox _ were postponed because relentless snow could
not be cleared from the field.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Seattle's spring close to what Mariners second baseman
David Bell remembers from his youthful days in his hometown of
Cincinnati.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some spring days there were colder than in the winter,'' he
said. ``Freezing rain, some snow ... it was tough. But it didn't
matter, because we played in it. The worst part was if you weren't
in the game. Sitting on the bench was terrible.''
</P>
<P>
   So comparatively, Tuesday night wasn't so bad. Since Rodriguez
and the rest of his teammates had almost no chance to get wood on
the ball, no hand injuries were reported.
</P>
<P>
   The big chill came not from the sky, but from 60 feet, 6 inches
away.

MARINERS LOSE OPENER TO RED SOX 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN HICKEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Pedro Martinez, quite obviously primed to defend his
American League Cy Young Award, threw ghostly pitches past the
Mariners for most of Tuesday night in leading Boston to a 2-0
opening night victory.
</P>
<P>
   Martinez, 23-4 a year ago, showed no evidence that the cool
Seattle air or the passage of another birthday has affected him in
the slightest. The 28-year-old right-hander fed the Mariners
streaks of fastballs and wisps of changeups for the better part of
108 pitches.
</P>
<P>
   Playing in front of a Safeco Field record crowd of 45,552 in the
first Safeco season-opener, Seattle got all of two hits off
Martinez and got just two runners past first base. Until baseball
rules permit holding over excess runs from spring training, that's
a sure way to lose the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   With the stuff Martinez had, he didn't need much support. Which
was good for Boston, because the Red Sox didn't get much off
Mariners starter Jamie Moyer. The lefty shut out Boston for the
first five innings, then suffered one-run paper cuts in the sixth
and seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Those rallies didn't draw much blood, but they were enough to
pronounce the Mariners down for the count in the first of 162
rounds of American League baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are times when Pedro's pitching when one run feels like
five runs,'' Mariners shortstop Alex Rodriguez said. ``Still, we
had a lot of optimism when it was 1-0. There are a lot of ways to
score a run.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he kept making good pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   So, too, did former Mariner Derek Lowe, who pitched the final
two innings, retiring all six batters he faced in sending the
Mariners to their third consecutive season-opening loss. The record
book will show that Moyer took the loss, but it won't show how
close he came to getting out of both the sixth and the seventh
unharmed.
</P>
<P>
   A two-out, bases-loaded roller off the bat of Troy O'Leary
produced the sixth-inning run when second baseman David Bell's
throw couldn't beat O'Leary to first base. An inning later, with
one out and a man on second, Jose Offerman's flare to left field
made it 2-0. Game time.
</P>
<P>
   ``O'Leary hit a chopper in the middle of nowhere for one run,''
M's pitching coach Bryan Price said. ``The other came from a hit
off the end of the bat.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary said he knew the play was going to be close, so he
didn't spare himself fleeing toward the sanctuary of first base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to instigate the call just in case it was
close,'' he said. ``I'm not the fastest man out there, but I got
down the line pretty good tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Martinez said runs were so hard to come by, ``we were probably
pushing him down the line.''
</P>
<P>
   That push would prove to be all the Red Sox would need, although
Offerman would add some insurance on a 50-degree night with his
double an inning later.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martinez is a true professional,'' Moyer said. ``He's got good
stuff, he's got great ability and he's got great competitiveness.
When you face him, you know it's going to be a test. It was fun.
I'm not saying I was sitting on the bench laughing, but you enjoy
the competition.''
</P>
<P>
   As much as the Mariners praised the 23-game winner, Martinez
said he wasn't quite right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt I got better command after the fifth inning,'' he said.
``I know I was spotting the fastball and throwing it hard, but the
breaking ball wasn't quite there. And the changeup wasn't pretty
despite throwing it frequently.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he primed for another 23-4-ish season? Not quite.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are special seasons,'' Martinez said. ``Those don't come
every day. You can't think about trying to do the same thing. It's
too hard. You'd go crazy before you pitched the first game.''
</P>
<P>
   The only ones who went crazy Tuesday night were the Mariners,
trying to figure out a way to solve the best pitcher in baseball.

WHAT-IF FILES: TORRE COULD EASILY BE MANAGING ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Perhaps the best manager ever employed by the
Anaheim Angels did all of his work in the press box.
</P>
<P>
   For more than five years (1985-1990), Joe Torre was the analyst
on Angels KTLA telecasts before being pulled away from his
microphone to manage the St. Louis Cardinals. He was a good
analyst, too, explaining strategy to viewers while adding honest
commentary in an understated way.
</P>
<P>
   But he's a better manager, as anyone in New York would tell you.
The Yankees, this week's opening series guests at Anaheim Stadium,
have won three world titles in four years under Torre's guidance,
all coming after the most fractious period in the Yankees'
considerable history.
</P>
<P>
   Between 1982 and 1995, the Yankees didn't play a single
post-season game. The closest they came was a 70-43 mark in 1994
before everyone adjourned for a strike. They employed 10 different
managers in that span Long Beach favorite son Bob Lemon, Gene
Michael, Clyde King, Billy Martin, Yogi Berra, Lou Piniella, Dallas
Green, Bucky Dent, Stump Merrill and Buck Showalter and made a
dozen managerial changes.
</P>
<P>
   The only franchise that comes closest to matching that kind of
instability would be the Angels. Mike Scioscia is the 16th Angels
manager since 1969, and the club has made a change during the
season a dozen times. The longest anyone has lasted with the Angels
since Bill Rigney managed the first eight-plus seasons was Gene
Mauch (1985-87) during his second tour.
</P>
<P>
   All this makes one wonder how different things might have been
for the Yankees, Angels and Torre if the late Gene Autry had
thought to consider hiring Torre as manager when he was in the
broadcast booth. There were windows of opportunity, in 1985, 1988
and 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gene and I would talk about managing, but we never talked
about my managing the team,'' Torre said Monday. ``I watched a few
good managers from the booth ... Mauch, Cookie Rojas, Doug Rader.''
</P>
<P>
   He also watched the 1986 Angels team, which won 92 games and was
a strike away from their first World Series appearance when
disaster struck in Game 5 of the ALCS against Boston. It was a sad
moment that left a mark on everyone involved. Mauch retired after
the 1987 season, still heartbroken from 1986. Pitcher Donnie Moore
would commit suicide a few years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was watching that game in Chicago, and I don't think I ever
pulled for a team more than I pulled for that one, for both
Genes,'' Torre said. ``Donnie was one of my guys, too. That was a
very sad time.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no way to know how Torre would have done as Angels
manager. But he would have been working for an owner who at the
time was willing to spend money as much as George Steinbrenner.
</P>
<P>
   Part of Torre's success in New York undoubtedly comes from his
ability to communicate with veteran, well-paid players. The Yankee
clubhouse is peaceful especially in contrast to the day-care
centers that were the Dodger and Angel clubhouses a year ago and
the team plays with envious discipline and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   In the hours before Monday's game, one could walk into the
Yankee clubhouse and account for all 25 players. A dozen or more
players, from Derek Jeter to Clay Bellinger, sat side-by-side on a
couch watching other games.
</P>
<P>
   Across the field, the Angels clubhouse was typically chilly. The
few players in it most hide in the outfield or the players-only
lounge to avoid contact with the media were moving around quietly.
</P>
<P>
   But Torre doesn't delude himself, either. He has the advantage
of Steinbrenner's money on his side and all of the favor curried in
winning a title in his first season (1996).
</P>
<P>
   He also walked the plank in his first three managing jobs. His
first run as a manager with the Mets produced zero winning seasons
in five years, and he was fired. He had winning seasons in two of
three years in Atlanta, but was fired anyway. He had three straight
winning seasons in St. Louis, but was fired after the labor chaos
of 1994-1995.
</P>
<P>
   He learned from those experiences, and understands that managing
in the 21st Century comes with little job security and a new set of
rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, stability doesn't happen in baseball unless you
win,'' he said. ``The track record (in New York) wasn't all that
great, either, and not so long ago. We won the first year (1996),
which cuts you some slack, then made the postseason the next. That
puts you in better shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``But there's no such thing as long term today. Everybody is
trying to win. Expansion clubs are trying to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels are trying to win, too, appearances aside. When asked
what chance Scioscia has, Torre talked about how the job
description has changed. In the '80s, managers could pull rank.
These days, most managers are outranked. When push came to shove
last season in Anaheim, it was Terry Collins tumbling out the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``Years ago, if you didn't like someone, you could dispatch that
person,'' he said. ``Now, you can't. You can't threaten players
with losing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, there are similarities with the way parents treat their
children. Parents can't threaten their kids. With kids, you have to
make sense and explain what you're doing and why you're doing it so
that maybe they will gain an understanding of it, as opposed to
doing so just because you said to.''
</P>
<P>
   The comparison shouldn't be taken literally. Torre isn't saying
ballplayers act like children. Just the opposite. They have to be
treated like men, with all the responsibilities that go with it.
</P>
<P>
   That was a core issue in the Angels' clubhouse escapades last
season, and no amount of lip service cures it overnight. Scioscia's
first season will be a work in progress.
</P>
<P>
   If there's anything Scioscia can learn from Torre, it may be
that it took Torre four shots to find the right job. The rest of us
may wonder how things might have changed if one of those shots had
been in Anaheim. &QL;

SEASON OPENER NO TIME TO BE LOOKING BACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ How was opening day?
</P>
<P>
   How about fickle?
</P>
<P>
   The weather was fickle, drizzly early in the day and later
sunny.
</P>
<P>
   Fickle also tells the story of the Safeco Field roof operators,
who were itchy on the trigger finger. Perhaps the point was:
</P>
<P>
   If you have a retractable roof, you might as well show the darn
thing off.
</P>
<P>
   During batting practice, the roof was closed. Then, as your 2000
Mariners came streaking down a swath of red carpet to a celebratory
introduction, the roof was peeled back. Then, just before game
time, the pricey canopy was wheeled closed again.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there was more back and forth on the roof Tuesday night
than meaningful, long-term negotiations between Alex Rodriguez's
agent and the Mariners, but that's a story for another day.
</P>
<P>
   However, while we're on the subject of Mariners superstars, it
was impossible to look out into the splendid, frigid, monstrous
theater of Safeco Field and not notice what was missing.
</P>
<P>
   We're talking about a little of that old electricity, the kind
generated by Ken Griffey Jr., who hit seven opening day homers
during his Seattle reign.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, after opting to go home to Cincinnati, Griffey is
the man Mariners fans can't afford to miss.
</P>
<P>
   Not now, anyway. Not on opening day. Not in April or May or
June. Not until the new Mariners like John Olerud and Mark McLemore
and Mike Cameron and Aaron Sele get their chance to show off.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there have been snide asides about how Griffey's house,
the Kingdome, is now just a heap of dust and rubble, as if it's a
proper metaphor.
</P>
<P>
   If there is quiet optimism in Seattle over the Mariners'
prospects in 2000, it is because there is a wing and a prayer that
the Ken Griffey Jr.-less Mariners are somehow better than Ken
Griffey Jr.'s Mariners, or better off, or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez, the new king of the M's (even though Lord A-Rod is
only renting his Safeco palace for the season), said he can't tell
us if the 2000 M's _ his M's _ are better without Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only the season will tell that,'' Rodriguez said. ``You have
to play it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of optimism all over baseball right now, and
we've had an optimistic spring, too. This team is a bunch of
gamers. We miss Ken as a teammate and as a friend, and right now
we're working on our camaraderie.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday night, even Griffey would have been hard-pressed to
muster a Safeco homer off Boston's Pedro Martinez, who was the star
of the show with a 2-0 victory and the sort of superlative snapping
off of strikeouts that should have won him the American League MVP
last season.
</P>
<P>
   But the M's don't face Martinez every night, thank goodness. And
Joe Morgan, the Hall of Fame second baseman from Cincinnati's Big
Red Machine days, said the Mariners are NOT better off without
Griffey.
</P>
<P>
   ``They can't be better. They can be a different team,'' Morgan
said. ``But I don't care what team you are, you can't take a
superstar's bat out of the lineup and become better.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm speaking from experience. When they took Tony Perez out of
the lineup, we still had Johnny Bench, Pete Rose, (myself) and
George Foster, but we were not the same. The Mariners can be a
different team. They can be good. But they will not be better. You
can't be better with 50 home runs and 140 RBIs gone. How can you be
better?''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan was talking in the Mariners dugout Tuesday night, fresh
off a plane from Cincinnati where his ESPN duties let him watch the
Reds' opener Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said Griffey was great, although nervous, and Reds fans
were terrific, cheering for Griffey's official debut before rain
ended the game in the sixth, with Griffey 0-for-2 after rushing two
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   If the Mariners can't be better without Griffey, how much better
are the Reds? Morgan says much better.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going to jump-start the Reds. I think they're going to
get off to a great start, and I think the Reds are the team to beat
in the Central Division because of that,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to explain that on the air (Monday). When you walk
down that tunnel every day with a superstar, a guy who can carry
you and win games by themself or carry you for weeks at a time, it
makes everyone around him better. It makes everyone else relax to
know he's the guy. He's going to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Optimists in Marinerville will say Griffey didn't do enough of
that in his last days here. Marinerville optimists will say A-Rod
will lead the way now, for awhile at least.
</P>
<P>
   But Morgan, a self-admitted Mariners fan, isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everybody's underestimating. I think you always
underestimate (the loss of a player like Griffey) until it
happens,'' Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that's necessarily bad. If you're on the
Mariners, if you're in the city, you should underestimate his loss
because you want to go out and play the best you can without any
strings attached.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to go out there and say `Hey, we can be better.' You
want to go out there with the attitude, `Hey, now the rest of us
will have a chance to shine.' You don't want to out there as a
Mariner feeling the loss of him yet. They will feel it, but you
don't want to go out there with that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is praiseworthy to be fickle about the loss of
Griffey, as Morgan suggests. The first season without him is under
way now. We can look back later, if this early optimism gives way
to another reality.

SONICS TOP NUGGETS, REGAIN SWAGGER IN KEYARENA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RONALD TILLERY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ When the Sonics run an offensive play designed for
Horace Grant to score, one of four things are taking place.
</P>
<P>
   Either: a) his four teammates completely misread a signal from
the bench, b) Grant and the Sonics are both so potent with the ball
that anything goes in a rout, c) Grant mistakenly wore Vin Baker's
jersey or d) the normally mild-mannered Grant wielded a remote
control in a threatening manner to get his way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the type of question worth a million dollars for the
correct response. But the final answer is ``b,'' which provided the
most astute assessment of the Sonics' 106-93 victory over the
Denver Nuggets Tuesday night in KeyArena.
</P>
<P>
   Grant put together his best offensive performance of the season.
He led five Sonics scorers in double figures with 26 points. The
13-year veteran is usually revered for his defense and rebounding.
However, this time Grant transformed into a scoring machine.
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-10 center sank his first 10 shots. At one point,
Grant's shooting line hit 13-for-14. That is when Sonics coach Paul
Westphal, with game in hand, decided Grant was eligible for a ``Who
Wants to Be The Man?'' segment of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't had a play run for me in 10 years,'' said Grant, who
made 13 of 17 shots for the game and picked up 12 rebounds along
the way, ``and coach wanted to give me a post-up play. The easiest
shot I was supposed to make and I missed a layup. But, you know, we
were just having some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics were also just taking care of business in dispatching
the 30-44 Nuggets. Since losing five consecutive games at home, the
Sonics have won two in a row in KeyArena by an average margin of 14
points.
</P>
<P>
   It was an timely victory considering Sacramento lost at Dallas.
It pulled the eighth-seeded Sonics within a half-game of the Kings
for the seventh spot in the Western Conference playoff standings.
</P>
<P>
   Grant's outburst was also suitable in that forward Baker had an
off night, going 0-for-7 for seven points. Gary Payton had 21
points and 13 assists but shot a paltry 7-for-20 from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's always scored,'' Westphal said of Grant, who scored all
his points without a single free throw. ``He's a good,
double-figure scorer, and we need him to score for us. If he can
get 10, 12, or 15 points every night, it makes it that much easier
for everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant normally gets his points when teams double-team Payton and
Baker _ a strategy that was both effective and painful for Denver.
Grant made the Nuggets pay by making mid-range jumpers that had
been failing him lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve (Gordon, a shooting coach with the team) has been
working with me on game days,'' Grant said. ``We shoot for about 45
minutes in the mornings, and he told me to stay focused on my shot
and bend my knees _ you know, the fundamental stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Denver tried to offset Grant with George McCloud's 28 points off
the bench and forward Antonio McDyess' 17 points and 15 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   However, each time the Nuggets threatened, the Sonics answered
with easy fast-break baskets . The Sonics 18-point third-quarter
lead got sliced to 87-81 early in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Then, Sonics backup forward Jelani McCoy and guard Brent Barry
responded with a back-to-back dunks. Denver never got within eight
points after that sequence.
</P>
<P>
   McCoy, who scored 12 points, mimicked Grant to some degree by
making all six shots he took.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to come in and bring energy, play defense and play
hard,'' McCoy said. `` ... I just tried to go out there and make
something happen, and some shots happened to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant and McCoy made it a long night for the Nuggets' young
front line _ particularly rookie Keon Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to get back on (Grant),'' Denver coach Dan
Issel said, ``but we were slow on recovery, and that certainly
didn't help.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither did the Sonics' defense (which held the Nuggets' to 41
percent shooting), rebounding (the Sonics held a 48-41 edge) and
free throw shooting. The Sonics are the second-worst foul shooting
team in the league, but made 18 of 21 free throws against Denver.
</P>
<P>
   The Sonics' transition offense put distance between themselves
and the Nuggets in the first half. Leading 35-28, Greg Foster sank
an 18-footer. McCoy then rammed back-to-back dunks after beating
the Nuggets up court on fast breaks. The Sonics eventually took a
60-51 halftime lead.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Westphal was very aware of the Sacramento loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told the team that the playoffs start now,'' said Westphal,
whose team improved to 24-7 against teams with losing records.
``It's time for a charge. We're in a position where we expect to
have one, and we've got to go out and take care of games like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   With eight games left, there is no other way to play.

TRAINER SAHADI USES GENTLE TOUCH
</HEADLINE>
 
Eds: Fixes first name ``Jenine'' sted Janine (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By FRANK C. GIRARDOT  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ The Deputy, a big three-year-old colt with
tons of promise, walked onto the track at Santa Anita and stopped.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps he was just enjoying the warm sun on his back or the
stiff wind in his face. Whatever. He was stopped and not in much of
a hurry to go anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   His trainer Jenine Sahadi, surrounded by a busy television crew,
walked over and smiled. In a fleeting, but candid moment, before
the crew had their equipment set, Sahadi gave her charge a nice pat
on the head and sent him off to do a workout as if there was no one
else within miles.
</P>
<P>
   Just like that his mood changed and The Deputy galloped off to
begin his workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very, very good horse,'' she said. ``I think we're
finding out now just how good he is.''
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy is one of six horses scheduled to run in this
Saturday's $1 million Santa Anita Derby. Depending on his
performance it's likely he'll take a shot at the Triple Crown
beginning with a run in the Kentucky Derby on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   If The Deputy runs in both derbies, Sahadi, a 34-year-old
resident of Pasadena, would be the first woman to train a horse in
both events.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's upbeat,'' she said. ``It's been fun with him ...
training for the Santa Anita Derby and Kentucky Derby, so it's
exciting in that respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Hall of Fame Jockey Chris McCarron, himself the winner of two
Kentucky Derbies and a pair of Santa Anita Derbies will be aboard
The Deputy on Saturday. As a guy who's ridden for some of history's
top trainers, McCarron holds nothing but praise for Sahadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very understanding to ride for,'' McCarron said.
``Jenine is very frank _ she speaks her mind. She tells you exactly
what's she's thinking, which I like in a person.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a tremendous amount of success together so it's been
a good relationship,'' he continued. ``She's been really great with
(The Deputy), she's asked me for input, she's allowed to
participate in some of the preparation and everything, she's asked
me my opinion and it's been an enjoyable experience.''
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first time, Sahadi has been in the spotlight for
breaking down walls separating the sexes in the horse racing
community. In 1996, she became the first woman to win a Breeder's
Cup race _ and a $1 million race _ when Lit de Justice won the
Breeder's Cup Sprint at Woodbine.
</P>
<P>
   She followed that up with a win in the same race in 1997 at
Hollywood Park with Elmhurst. The list of Sahadi's training
accomplishments goes even further.
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi's won stakes at Santa Anita, Oak Tree, Del Mar, Hollywood
Park and Turf Paradise. In 1996, her earnings of more than $3.4
million ranked her 12th nationally and is the national record for
money won by a female trainer.
</P>
<P>
   Although she didn't begin training until 1993, Sahadi isn't new
to the game. Her parents, Fred and Helen Sahadi owned Cardiff Stud
Farm and Sahadi's been around thoroughbreds all her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``My high school graduation present was a race horse,'' Sahadi
said. ``Cutting Line. He broke his maiden and probably raced a few
times after that.''
</P>
<P>
   Sahadi graduated from USC with a degree in journalism and after
that went to work at Hollywood Park in both the publicity and
marketing departments.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that time the trackwas owned by Marge Everett. I got a
great background working for her and she and I got along real
well,'' Sahadi said. ``Under other circumstances things might not
have been so good. But she was pro-woman. I couldn't have asked for
a better opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   After seven years at Hollywood park, Sahadi went to work as an
assistant trainer to Julio Canani between 1991 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
   In her work on the backside, Sahadi gained a reputation for
caring about the horses she took care of. It's a reputation she
maintains to this day. While some in the gritty racing business may
look upon that as a weakness, plenty of others admire that quality
in Sahadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will say this about the women that I've ridden for,'' said
McCarron. ``They tend to be more conscientious. More like an animal
lover than the average male trainer. They really love their horses
and treat them like family.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a jockey's standpoint, when it comes to Jenine,''
McCarron said, ``I think that's a great quality.''
</P>
<P>
   And, Sahadi, who can be found at the track most mornings before
dawn, clad in her trademark sweatshirt and John Lennon sunglasses,
is proud of her pro-horse stance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The horses need to be the priority,'' she said. ``They are not
here to be just exploited. Fortunately, the people I train for
understand how I feel.''
</P>
<P>
   That kinder, gentler treatment of the animals is a large part of
Sahadi's training philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't need to be a rocket scientist to do this,'' she
said. ``I treat my horses like pets. After that it's all a little
bit of luck and a little bit of common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you feed him right and train him right, you are going to be
fortunate.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, despite her success on the track and her attitude
toward the hores in the stable, Sahadi has a difficult time
maintaining a full barn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would venture to say that if a man was in the same position
as me he would have a lot of clients,'' Sahadi said. ``But, I
haven't been inundated with clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps all that is about to change, but for now Sahadi's got to
get The Deputy ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always something to do,'' she says, walking away. &QL;

CONDOR RETURNS TO WILD ON WING AND A PRAYER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By STEVE CARNEY 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FILLMORE, Calif. _ She hopped to the edge of the cliff Tuesday
morning, paused and took off _ soaring above the Sespe Condor
Sanctuary in Ventura County.
</P>
<P>
   AC-8 was home.
</P>
<P>
   After 14 years in captivity, where she was bred to help revive
the population of the nearly-extinct California condor, Adult
Condor 8 became the first of its species to be returned to its
former home.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife officials hope the bird, estimated to be between 24 and
40 years old, will act as a mentor to the two 10-month old condors
released with her _ showing them how to forage, where to nest and
how to avoid the dangers of human contact.
</P>
<P>
   She hasn't done so on her own since 1986 when she was captured,
as one of the last 27 of her kind alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was the last of the free-flying condors,'' said Marc
Weitzel, project leader for the U.S. Fish &AMP; Wildlife Service.
``She's come around full-circle.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the species has 157 birds, with 60 of those born in
captivity and released into the wild since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   The methodical, 30-year process of reviving the species has cost
an estimated $25 million in funding from federal, state and local
agencies, and private sources including the Zoological Society of
San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity for man to bring a species back from
the brink,'' Weitzel said. ``A lot of people consider the
California condor to be the flagship of endangered species. We feel
they have as much right to exist on the Earth as man does.''
</P>
<P>
   Hunting, poisoning and loss of habitat drove the species to the
edge of oblivion. In 1986 wildlife biologists made a critical
decision: Remove the remaining 27 condors from the wild and try to
breed them in captivity, in hopes of one day re-introducing them to
the skies through which they once soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was believed if these birds were left in the wild, they
would have gone extinct,'' Weitzel said.
</P>
<P>
   The plan seems to have worked. Of the 157 total birds, 19 live
in the wild in Southern California, 15 in Central California and 26
in Arizona. All the birds released before AC-8 on Tuesday were born
in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   AC-8 hatched nine chicks during her time at the San Diego Wild
Animal Park, but the last was in 1995 and keepers believe she may
be past breeding age. So they felt she would be most useful as a
mentor in the wild, as some of the chicks bred in captivity and
released eventually flew into power lines, drank antifreeze and
died, or otherwise strayed dangerously close to humans.
</P>
<P>
   Better still, she may find a mate and start hatching again.
</P>
<P>
   ``In either case she's an important bird for the program. It's a
win-win for us,'' said Michael Mace, curator of birds at the Wild
Animal Park.
</P>
<P>
   Conservationists' goal is to have at least 150 condors in the
wild in California, 150 in Arizona and 150 in captivity.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:05 a.m. Tuesday, when wildlife officers released
AC-8 and the two younger birds, she ``spread her wings and kind of
posed for the camera, and then launched off the cliff,'' Weitzel
said.
</P>
<P>
   The next step in the program may come next year, when the first
hatchlings released in 1992 will be old enough to reproduce,
Weitzel said.
</P>
<P>
   Then, he said, the wild California condors the rarest and
largest birds in North America, with 10-foot wingspans and ``a face
only a mother could love'' may become proud parents themselves.

 RULING PARTY PICKS NO. 2 OFFICIAL TO TAKE OVER AS JAPAN
PREMIER  (Also see JAPAN-OBUCHI-REACT) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Just hours after the Cabinet resigned to make way for a
smooth transfer of power, Japan's governing party on Wednesday
nominated its secretary general, Yoshiro Mori, to replace the
ailing prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, who was felled over the
weekend by a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Later both houses of the Parliament voted for Mori as the new
prime minister. He and his new Cabinet were expected to be sworn in
by Emperor Akihito later on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The nomination of Mori, who was second to Obuchi in the party
hierarchy, reflected the fulfillment of a carefully choreographed
script by the governing Liberal Democratic Party to ensure a smooth
and quick succession to Obuchi, who still lies in a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Once Mori is sworn in, the new prime minister, a longtime party
stalwart, is widely expected to organize new elections quickly,
most likely before Japan plays host to a summit meeting of the
leading economic powers, known as the Group of Eight, in Okinawa in
July.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement of Mori's selection by the Liberal Democrats
and his ratification by Parliament represents the culmination of an
extraordinary transition in Japanese politics, in which news of
Obuchi's hospitalization early on Sunday was kept from the nation
for 22 hours while party leaders consulted among themselves over
what to do next.
</P>
<P>
   From the moment the announcement of Obuchi's stroke was made,
late Sunday evening, the succession of events here has been almost
blindingly fast for a country more used to political changes
measured at a snail's pace.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of the succession, however, from the temporary
passing of power to a caretaker prime minister, Mikio Aoki, to the
selection of Mori in backroom consultations among the party's
factions has left many Japanese complaining that their political
system is both antiquated and relatively undemocratic.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was Japan's first prime minister to suffer a
catastrophically incapacitating illness before any transition
arrangements could be made, revealing a system badly unprepared for
such an eventuality. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mori, in a brief statement on Wednesday morning, praised
Obuchi's record and promised to follow in his footsteps. ``My
mission is to make sure that we stay on the path of economic
growth,'' he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He is expected to continue Obuchi's policies, including giving
priority to economic growth, even if that means increases in
government debt. In preparation for the party decision, the Cabinet
resigned on Tuesday evening. Mori is expected to reappoint the
ministers and then turn to regular business, including economic
doldrums and scheduled diplomatic meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, 62, won support by demonstrating a strong loyalty to
Obuchi. Even more useful to him were his close ties to the party's
major coalition partner, the Buddhist-backed New Komeito. Mori's
ratification by the parliament, or Diet, is already considered a
foregone conclusion, since the coalition, led by the Liberal
Democratic Party, has a large majority.
</P>
<P>
   Mori is a lifelong party operative who, as with Obuchi before
him, gradually rose through the ranks. He was elected to parliament
in 1969 and at various times was education minister, head of the
party policy council, trade and industry minister and construction
minister. He has twice been secretary general of the Liberal
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   But the portfolios that typically define the true party
heavyweights, finance minister and foreign minister, have eluded
him. Those gaps in his resume and his reputation for timidity on
policy issues have led many commentators to say they would expect
little innovation under his leadership.

 TOKYO: his leadership.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many commentators said Tuesday, however, that by choosing Mori _
a burly, raspy voiced politician not especially known for his
personal popularity or campaigning skills _ the party was taking a
huge risk in national elections that are widely expected before
summer.
</P>
<P>
   With tears streaking down his cheeks, the caretaker prime
minister, Mikio Aoki, said Tuesday afternoon that the dissolution
of the government was made ``based on the judgment of the doctors
and from the viewpoint that we should not allow even one moment's
political vacuum.''
</P>
<P>
   The news came after persistent reports throughout the day that
Obuchi's condition was steadily worsening and that the prime
minister was brain dead. Aoki denied that, calling himself ``very
upset'' at news organizations for passing on rumors.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians close to the transition process and several Japanese
political analysts said Tuesday that the governing party had used
the extraordinary 22-hour news blackout surrounding Obuchi's
hospitalization early Sunday, and the carefully stage-managed
process since, to engineer the selection of Mori as its unopposed
candidate for the succession.
</P>
<P>
   The party has a long history of running things; it has governed
the country alone or in coalitions for all but two and a half years
since 1955.
</P>
<P>
   The secretive handling of the news of Obuchi's hospitalization
and the back-room machinations drew renewed criticisms Tuesday from
several quarters, with the view that the episode revealed a side of
Japan that was neither altogether modern nor Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of Mori speaks volumes, political experts say, about
unusual imperatives in Japanese politics _ loyalty to partners and
allies in a crunch _ rather than to the party's immediate political
needs and even, potentially, to its survival.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not that the LDP lacks people who could enjoy
popularity,'' said Masumi Ishikawa, a professor of politics at
Niigata University of International and Information Studies.
``There is Mr. Kono and Mr. Kato, both of whom would probably be
more popular.''
</P>
<P>
   Yohei Kono, the foreign minister, and Koichi Kato, a former
chief Cabinet secretary, were both believed to aspire to the prime
minister's job.
</P>
<P>
   ``The LDP is basing its decision on who has a good relationship
with Komeito,'' Ishikawa, a former senior political correspondent
of the daily Asahi Shimbun, said. ``They are not thinking of the
reaction of the people of Japan, and this behavior is very
strange.''
</P>
<P>
   Many analysts were describing the Liberal Democratic Party's
choice of Mori on the basis of the New Komeito Party's comfort as a
recipe for electoral difficulties, because the coalition between
the two parties has been deeply unpopular since it was formed last
October. Opinion polls have consistently shown that Japanese voters
disapprove of having a party with religious affiliations in the
government.
</P>
<P>
   The new government will have to dissipate growing criticism of
the secretive, seemingly antiquated mechanics of a succession in
which Aoki was allowed to become caretaker merely on the basis of
what he described as a private conversation with Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   Further contributing to the image of a process of party barons
meeting in smoke-filled rooms to keep the public in the dark was
the way in which Mori was selected.
</P>
<P>
   Some insiders spoke with almost reverential approval of the
offstage consultations that produced Mr. Mori as Mr. Obuchi's
successor, describing it as a confirmation of the efficiency of the
political system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Aoki's reaction to Obuchi's collapse was very tactful,''
said Kozo Watanabe, the deputy speaker of parliament's lower house.
``If he had waited a week or 10 days after Mr. Obuchi collapsed,
somebody else could have raised their hand as a candidate, and
there could be some chaos.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the time Mr. Aoki announced the condition of Mr.
Obuchi, it was already virtually decided who would take over.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, for independent politicians and commentators,
and indeed much of the public, the process provided a field day of
introspection about how, 55 years after World War II, Japan has
remained a democracy largely in name, rather than in spirit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The process of choosing a successor has revealed itself as not
very democratic, and is indeed very closed,'' said Shusei Tanaka, a
political scientist at Fukuyama University in Hiroshima.
</P>
<P>
   ``The feeling is that even if the prime minister changes, the
policies won't,'' he said.

KOBE-LESS LAKERS SLIP BY SUNS, 84-83
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Officially, the NBA's one-game suspension applied only
to Kobe Bryant. But it looked as if the Lakers had their entire
offense put into suspended animation Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   Everything, of course, except for Shaquille O'Neal. And
fortunately for the Lakers, that _ plus a bit of defense, a little
clutch shooting from Robert Horry and an extra helping of luck _
was all the Lakers needed for a nail-biting 84-83 victory over the
Phoenix Suns at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers extended their winning streak to 10 and cut their
magic number for clinching the NBA's best record to one. But it
didn't come easily with Bryant sitting home in L.A. serving his
suspension.
</P>
<P>
   They survived a clutch 3-pointer from the Suns' Clifford
Robinson, escaped despite two missed free throws by Ron Harper with
22.7 seconds left, then held off the Suns' last charge, an errant
25-footer from Robinson with the final seconds ticking away.
</P>
<P>
   They manufactured a win even while shooting 40.2 percent and
committing 18 turnovers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wow, what an ugly game we played tonight,'' said coach Phil
Jackson, ``and won it. I don't know how.''
</P>
<P>
   They did it mostly on the strength of O'Neal's 32 points, plus
several key plays from Horry and Rick Fox in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was his game,'' Jackson said of O'Neal, ``and it showed
the reason why he's the MVP.''
</P>
<P>
   After Harper's missed free throws, the Suns had a chance to win
it. Trailing 84-83, they tried in vain to work the ball inside, but
Robinson was forced to shoot from behind the arc. The attempt
struck the back of the rim and the Lakers batted away the long
rebound as time expired.
</P>
<P>
   Good defense or good luck, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept them outside, we didn't give them a chance to get down
the line,'' Harper said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were lucky. Very lucky,'' said Horry, who finished with 11
points and 11 rebounds, his first double-double of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Harper could have made the last play irrelevant by
making his free throws. But both bounced off the iron.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harp is a reluctant free-throw shooter and there have been
many games that either I've had him take the ball out of bounds or
he's the decoy, because he is reluctant in that regard,'' Jackson
said. ``But tonight he was the guy that kept standing up for us
most of the time, so it was appropriate that he had to come back
and get the ball and was the guy that had to go to that line.''
</P>
<P>
   Harper laughed off the ``reluctant'' tag _ ``That's some Phil
talk,'' he said _ but was relieved the misses didn't lead to a
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually I will hit them, but today was one of those days,'' he
said. ``The bear ate me. I didn't eat the bear. So I'll take the
win.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory gave the Lakers a season sweep of the Suns, a
potential second-round playoff opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Penny Hardaway led the Suns with 23 points and 10 assists, and
Robinson scored 20 points. Kevin Johnson, who recently unretired to
fill the void left by the injured Jason Kidd, played his first game
back at America West and scored 14 points against the Lakers'
undermanned backcourt.
</P>
<P>
   With 29 wins in their last 30 games, the Lakers (63-12) also
have their third double-digit winning streak of the season _ a feat
achieved only twice before in NBA history. This streak, however,
nearly was history.
</P>
<P>
   The offense often sputtered without Bryant's playmaking and the
Lakers struggled to find other sources of offense. Derek Fisher,
starting in Bryant's place, went 2 for 11. Brian Shaw was 2 for 7.
A.C. Green went 0 for 4. And Glen Rice, expected to pick up the
slack, scored just 10 points on 4-of-13 shooting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, we're disappointed,'' Jackson said, ``and yet we did the
job and won the game and we have to look at it as a team win. ...
</P>
<P>
   ``It was good fortune, basically, that won us the game,'' he
said. ``We led most of the way during this game and it was really
our game to lose. And we almost accomplished it.'' &QL;

BERNIE'S BASH BEATS ANGELS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ The Angels played about as well as they could play the
last two nights, and all they have to show for it is a 0-2 record.
</P>
<P>
   Loss No.2 came Tuesday after Bernie Williams' two-out, two-run
home run off Angels closer Troy Percival (0-1) in the ninth inning
gave the New York Yankees a 5-3 victory in front of 25,818 at
Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   Williams went the other way, slicing a fastball on the outside
corner from Percival just inside the left-field foul pole and into
the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it would get out, but it did,'' said Percival,
who made his first appearance of the season following offseason
shoulder surgery. ``I've had my day with him, and today, he got
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival blamed his approach and not the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mentally I wasn't real sharp,'' he said. ``I didn't move
anybody off the plate. I was trying to locate the ball and that's
not my game. ... I'm not a pitcher, I'm an aggressive thrower. I
got myself in a pitching mode and that's my fault.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had rallied against Yankees starter Roger Clemens to
take a 3-2 lead in the sixth, but Williams came up with a
game-tying RBI double in the seventh inning. The Angels outhit the
Yankees for the second night in a row, 10-9, but the Yankees made
their hits count.
</P>
<P>
   With two out and nobody on in the ninth, Paul O'Neill grounded a
single up the middle to set up Williams for the game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm more upset about the pitch to O'Neill,'' Percival said.
``I hung a splitter. I had more options and threw an 84-mph
splitter over the middle of the plate. That was my only mistake of
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Kennedy (Cal State Northridge) tied a career-high with four
hits in the game for the Angels, but he never got past second base.
Leadoff hitter Darin Erstad followed Monday's three-hit performance
with two more Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing a good job of setting the table, now if we can get
some of the guys to clean it up, we'll be fine,'' Angels manager
Mike Scioscia said. ``No way Mo (Vaughn), Timmy (Salmon) and Garret
(Anderson) are going to leave guys on base the whole year like
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn, Salmon and Anderson _ the Nos.3, 4 and 5 hitters _ are a
combined 4 for 26 with two RBI in the first two games.
</P>
<P>
   Once Williams gave the Yankees the lead in the ninth, Mariano
Rivera closed it out for his second save in as many nights. Ramiro
Mendoza (1-0) pitched one scoreless innings to get the victory.
</P>
<P>
   Making his Angels debut, starter Kent Bottenfield gave up two
runs and five hits in 5 innings, the second solid performance by an
Angels starter after Ken Hill's opening-night performance (5
innings, 2 runs, 4 hits in a 3-2 loss). Bottenfield gave up an RBI
single to Jorge Posada in the fourth inning, and an RBI triple to
Tino Martinez in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to set a good impression for my teammates,''
Bottenfield said. ``I have to earn respect from them. But you can't
do it in one night. It's something you have to see over time in my
approach and my performance.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was everything we expected,'' Scioscia said of
Bottenfield. ``He had great command and moved the ball in and out.
He kept a good left-handed hitting lineup off balance all night.'' &QL;

CLIPPERS RALLY FALLS SHORT AGAINST JAZZ, 103-93
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 c.2000 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Most students of Clipperology 2000 eventually
become disillusioned by the lack of variety in game-night failure.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the hackneyed routine: a competent first quarter,
followed by three quarters of remarkably gruesome basketball.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday's 103-93 loss to the Utah Jazz risked the
application of an atypically entertaining format. After four days
since their last date, the Clippers opened the game in alarming
disarray. They spotted the Jazz 11 points, and rope-a-doped Utah
into leading by 15 points. The Jazz (50-23) led 29-20 at the end of
the first act.
</P>
<P>
   Then, backed by the semi-stunned howls from 13,819 Staples
Center fans, the home team rallied, pressing and outscoring Utah
30-22 in the second quarter to trail by one (51-50) at
intermission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were definitely leery after that slow start,'' said interim
Clippers coach Jim Todd. ``But we played hard for 48 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't enough to deal with Utah's Karl Malone, who worked for
37 minutes and produced 34 points, despite hoisting four of the 11
shots blocked by the Clippers.
</P>
<P>
   If the Clips _ as it has been alleged _ were conniving to lose
for the purpose of securing the first pick in the Y2K NBA Draft,
somebody missed rehearsal.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did a nice job of hanging in there,'' Jazz point guard
John Stockton (12 points, 8 assists) noticed. ``They shot well,
played good defense, executed.''
</P>
<P>
   This unexpected eruption of snappy play just may have coincided
with another unusual event _ the resurrection of Maurice Taylor and
Lamar Odom.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor returned from a five-game, ankle-related absence to score
16 points and locate 9 rebounds. He even twisted the bad wheel in
the third quarter, but insisted on remaining in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coming out of the game really hadn't crossed my mind,'' said
Taylor, who had been suspected by media watchdogs of babying the
ankle to avoid hacking his value in this summer's free-agent
supermarket. ``I know the chances of us winning are better with me
out on the court. I feel like it's my obligation to compete until
the end of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Odom, down five of the last seven games with alternate-calf
strains, contributed 11 points and enough savvy to make the entire
team play well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can play,'' Odom said, ``once we get it through our heads
to do what we're supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   So the Clippers (14-60) _ who received a team-high 20 points and
19 shots from Derek Anderson _ did lose for the 10th game in row.
But they actually refused to roll over at halftime, hustling out of
the dressing room to control the third quarter, too.
</P>
<P>
   Center Michael Olowokandi (16 points, 4 blocks) worked Utah's
Olden Polynice for 10 points in that period, which ended with the
Clippers leading 82-76.
</P>
<P>
   But Malone, who muscled up for 9 points in the fourth quarter,
scored from point-blank range to give Utah the lead for good at
87-86 with 7:10 to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Utah didn't get to this level by not being able to execute
down the stretch,'' said Todd, whose team has been blindfolded in
the fourth quarter before. &QL;

SMALLER, SIMPLER VIDEO RECORDER LETS YOU SAVE TV SHOWS WITHOUT
ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By AARON BARNHART  
 c. 2000 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Get ready to welcome a new abbreviation into the consumer
lexicon: PVR, as in personal video recorder.
</P>
<P>
   This tapeless TV technology may well challenge DVDs and
satellite dishes as the hottest video item in stores this year.
</P>
<P>
   PVRs _ minimalist-looking black boxes that save TV shows on a
hard drive instead of on videotape _ rolled onto the market in
mid-1999. Priced at $400 to $800, they immediately became the rage
among the nation's ``time-shifters,'' Americans determined to watch
their favorite TV shows when they want _ not when the networks
dictate they be in front of the tube.
</P>
<P>
   The PVR greatly simplifies the act of selecting a show to
record. It also does something no VCR can: It will actually pause
and ``rewind'' live television, as you watch it.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV and TiVo are the companies that sell personal video
recorder technology in the United States. Prices for PVRs have been
falling steadily; TiVo's models range from $399 to $699, while
ReplayTV's top model dropped from $599 to $499 in March. Look for
prices to drop below the magic $300 threshold soon. That's the same
divide DVDs crossed when their sales took off.
</P>
<P>
   Based on a comparison of the ReplayTV 2020, supplied to me by
ReplayTV Inc., and TiVo (with help from some of my TiVo-using
readers), I concluded that whether you choose ReplayTV or TiVo
depends more on the features you want than on either product's
recording quality or ease of use.
</P>
<P>
   There are three parts to any PVR: a sophisticated on-screen
guide, powerful microprocessor chips that turn the TV signal into
data, and a huge hard drive where the digital pictures are saved.
</P>
<P>
   To watch live TV, you can do the usual channel-surf, or use the
on-screen guide to browse the on-screen listings, then choose a
program. The listings are customized to your local cable, satellite
or over-the-air setup when you use your PVR for the first time.
Then, every night, the built-in modem dials out to a local number
and updates the listings. (TiVo charges $9.95 a month for the
listings service or $199 for a ``lifetime'' subscription. The more
expensive ReplayTV doesn't charge for listings.)
</P>
<P>
   As you watch a program, any program, the recorder automatically
saves everything you see onto the hard drive. Which means you can
pause the picture if something or somebody interrupts, or you can
review what you've just watched.
</P>
<P>
   What I found addictive was the ``instant replay'' feature that
lets you jump back (7 seconds on ReplayTV, 8 seconds on TiVo) at
the touch of a button.
</P>
<P>
   To anyone who has missed a line of dialogue on a program, or
waited in vain for a sportscast to show the last play over again,
the instant-replay button is strangely empowering. At first you'll
thrill to even the most seemingly trivial use, like when TiVo user
Jeff Reynolds was watching the Golden Globes and called his wife in
from the other room. He hit the instant-replay button and showed
her ``just how goofy-looking'' Peter Fonda's glasses were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that alone is worth a couple of hundred dollars,''
Reynolds said in an e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly as revolutionary as the live-TV features is the way the
PVR makes recording shows a relative breeze. For instance, here's
what I'd have to do to catch the nightly broadcast of ``Late Show
With David Letterman'' on my VCR:
</P>
<P>
   1. Put a blank tape in the machine.
</P>
<P>
   2. Hit the PROG button on my VCR's remote control.
</P>
<P>
   3. Enter the start time (10:35 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   4. Enter the end time (11:38 p.m.).
</P>
<P>
   5. Enter the channel (3, for KCTV).
</P>
<P>
   6. Hit PROG two more times to OK the recording.
</P>
<P>
   7. Shut off my VCR. If I have other tapes I want to watch, I'll
have to find another machine or remember to pop the blank back into
the VCR before airtime.
</P>
<P>
   Now here's how I record Letterman using ReplayTV:
</P>
<P>
   1. Press the Channel Guide button for the on-screen TV listings
supplied by ReplayTV.
</P>
<P>
   2. Scroll over to tonight's listing for ``Late Show With David
Letterman.''
</P>
<P>
   3. Press the REC button twice.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. Three steps and I have Dave for life _ not just
tonight's broadcast but every broadcast till kingdom come. No
tapes, no times, no 8-digit VCR Plus codes and, best of all, no
screwups.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does a personal video recorder require fewer steps to
record, the steps are more intuitive. Though I was using ReplayTV,
the recording process is much the same for products licensed by
TiVo.
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV and TiVo also let you search for shows by name and set
up ``theme channels'' to automatically record any show with a
certain keyword in its description (e.g., Bogart or millionaire).
</P>
<P>
   The on-screen guides are comparable to those found on
satellite-TV systems from DirecTV and DISH Network, or the new
digital-cable service of Time Warner Cable. They have full capsule
descriptions of all shows looking out a week in advance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the basic route taken above, you can tell your PVR to
save a certain number of back episodes of each show; if you like to
record a lot of programs, you may want to keep your backlog to one
episode apiece, lest you run out of disk space. Both PVRs also have
a feature for transferring favorite episodes to your VCR.
</P>
<P>
   Until now ReplayTV has been available only from ReplayTV Inc.,
either direct at www.replaytv.com or through online retailers such
as amazon.com. Panasonic is introducing ShowStopper, the first
retail version of ReplayTV, in stores this month. Philips already
manufactures retail TiVo boxes, and Sony also has licensed TiVo's
technology.
</P>
<P>
   Here are the drawbacks, and they are complaints made by ReplayTV
and TiVo owners alike:
</P>
<P>
   - As with every video device, there's an inevitable tradeoff
between recording time and video quality. The ReplayTV 2020, for
instance, brags about its ``20 hours of storage,'' but that's only
if you accept the standard recording speed. Many viewers won't.
Standard speed results in a rough-quality image that pixillates
heavily when there's a lot of action (a movie or a football game,
for instance).
</P>
<P>
   ReplayTV offers three levels of recording quality, TiVo four.
But the higher in quality you go, the less total storage you'll
have _ far less than the 20 hours ReplayTV claims (30 hours for
TiVo's top model).
</P>
<P>
   If you're less concerned about quality than about not missing
your must-see TV, or if you tend to record programs that don't move
around a lot, such as talk shows, you'll happily accept this
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   - Not everybody has a phone line in the room where they watch
TV, which is a problem since the PVR needs one to dial out for the
nightly updates. In my case I had to string a cord out of the
kitchen; to keep from tripping over it, I applied several long
strips of duct tape to the floor and countertop. Duct tape, as all
home decorators know, adds a special boiler-room touch to any
living space.
</P>
<P>
   - These first-generation PVRs have trouble with the vagaries of
network schedules. For instance, NBC's and CBS' late-night shows
actually end at 11:38 local time _ but ReplayTV and TiVo both shut
off at 11:35, the ``published'' ending time.
</P>
<P>
   Both PVR makers say they are planning to add a feature that will
let viewers add an extra few minutes to the recording time. Since
this is a software fix, older models will likely also get it by way
of the nightly schedule update.
</P>
<P>
   - You're going to be watching more TV. Some users say they watch
less TV thanks to their PVRs, but most couch potatoes I heard from
said the opposite was true. It seems that being able to watch
programs more selectively actually increases your appetite for
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure I'm watching more TV now,'' said Kevin Hamburger,
producer of TV's ``Politically Incorrect'' and an ardent TiVo user.
</P>
<P>
   - It's one more set-top box to set on top of all your other
set-top boxes. But at least there's no LED panel blinking 12:00 for
all eternity.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Like all microcomputers, the personal video
recorder is going to get cheaper, faster and better the longer you
wait to buy one. But if the idea of never again missing a favorite
show or a compelling video moment is irresistible to you, the time
to buy one of these beauties is now.

 &HT;    Pay $35,000 to move a tree? Leaf me out
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Activists are trying to save a large live oak
tree near Auditorium Shores even though it may be 40 years old _
instead of 300 years old as was originally suspected.
</P>
<P>
   A 40-year-old-tree. I'm supposed to be impressed? We've got
hippies around here older than that, and nobody's trying to save
them. And have you ever wondered why they call them live oaks? Of
course they're live. If they weren't live, they'd be firewood.
</P>
<P>
   At first, it was thought a big live oak next to an Austin Parks
and Recreation building west of Palmer Auditorium was ancient,
historical _ a Treaty Oak sort of a tree.
</P>
<P>
   That's what Kaye Trybus of the South Central Coalition of
Neighborhoods told the Austin Chronicle, anyway. ``You can always
plant another tree,'' she told the Chronicle. ``But you can't plant
a 300-year-old tree.''
</P>
<P>
   Save the tree, she said. This is an old tree. This is a tree
with roots. This is a tree that has been around longer than Gus
Garcia, Carl Hickerson, even Willie Kocurek. Trybus says landscape
architects working on Town Lake Park guesstimated the tree to be
300 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Trybus was concerned because the old tree would be taken down as
part of the redo of the Greater Palmer Auditorium area into a park,
community events center, and performing arts center, or, if you
will, a toe-dancing joint. She wants the tree dug up and moved to
another spot.
</P>
<P>
   So now comes KEYE-TV reporter and meteorologist Dan Robertson.
He reads in the Chronicle about the 300-year-old tree that needs
saving and decides to do his own story. So he visits the Austin
History Center and looks for a photo of the alleged AARP Oak. He
looks at photos of Palmer Auditorium under construction in the
1950s. This tree does not appear in these photos. Finally,
Robertson finds a tree in the right location in a photo from 1967.
The tree is a sapling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anything about trees really,'' Robertson said.
``But it did kind of spoil the story.''
</P>
<P>
   But it's still a swell tree. So Trybus and friends still want to
save it from the bulldozer. She says $35,000, or close to it, is
needed by the end of May to pay Environmental Design, a tree moving
company in Tomball, to move it. They're looking for a donor.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't that a lot of bread to save a grackle launchpad of
questionable heritage? Maybe I'm a little fed up with trees,
though, because I just backed into one the other day in the
Jovita's parking lot, and it's going to set me back several hundred
bucks at Southwest Body &AMP; Paint.
</P>
<P>
   Probably the reason some people thought the tree was 300 years
old is that it's big for 40. The tree, says David Marks, president
of Environmental Design, is 45 inches in diameter, which he says is
larger than normal. So what would make it grow so fast?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it was the speed rolling downhill from Armadillo World
Headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   There are more cost-effective ways to save this tree. With all
of these Californians moving to town, somebody ought to move into
it. Isn't that what Californians do when they want to save a big
tree? Get a sleeping bag, climb up in there and refuse to come
down? With rents being what they are around here, think of the
savings. You could probably rent the lower limb to a family of four
for $800 a month.

 &HT;    Maybe Microsoft went too far, but it did more for buyers than
ruling did
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The government stomped a mud hole in Microsoft.
Why don't I feel good about it?
</P>
<P>
   After all, government attorneys keep saying that they spent $15
million in tax dollars to protect consumers.
</P>
<P>
   I'm a consumer. I should be celebrating _ popping champagne
corks. Hurrah, valiant government knights on charging steeds slew
the dragon and saved me and all my fellow consumers huddled in our
global cybervillage.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement Monday by U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson that the Bill Gates dragon had violated antitrust laws
caused Gates to drop a cool $12 billion in the value of his
personal stock holdings.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't really care if Gates loses a few billion
dollars. He's got more billions to tide him over.
</P>
<P>
   As crass as it must sound, I was thinking about me, not the
world's richest man, when I heard that Microsoft had been found
guilty of unfair competition. Microsoft stock went into free-fall
and took other technical stocks down with it.
</P>
<P>
   As a longtime computer devotee, I still have a Victor computer
that runs CPM, a computer operating software that predates Gates'
DOS software.
</P>
<P>
   CPM may have been superior to Gate's software, but the brilliant
man who invented it didn't have Gate's vision of the future, his
marketing savvy or his ruthlessness.
</P>
<P>
   I also have an old database management program that boots up
from 5.25-inch floppy disks to show a single dot on the screen.
From that single point, you have to build your database program. It
takes the patience of Job and the brains of Einstein to get
anything useful out of it.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing about this program or anything else associated with the
early days of computers could be described as user-friendly.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gates may have broken a few eggs while making his omelette,
but it was a meal that the consumers got to eat.
</P>
<P>
   Compared to the computer fare we had been fed before Gates began
to consolidate all the dead-end digital dissonance, Microsoft food
tasted pretty good. And the price was right, too.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' marketing and business tactics overwhelmed or absorbed
any number of products that appeared superior to Microsoft's
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   Apple computers come to mind. I have always felt that Apple had
a better, more bullet-proof platform and operating system than PCs
and DOS/Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The Tucker car introduced after World War II was superior to
anything Ford or General Motors offered. It still failed.
</P>
<P>
   This sort of thing happens all the time. Marketing and agility
often overcome quality, which doesn't count for much if it doesn't
get into the hands of consumers at an affordable price.
</P>
<P>
   I can't argue that Microsoft did not violate antitrust laws, but
I do think that the company brought light into the darkness of
computer geekdom. For that, consumers should be thankful.
</P>
<P>
   The railroad pioneers were considered saviors when they were
bringing trade and prosperity to an expanding frontier. Later,
after the country was settled, they were considered robber barons.
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said for ``The Telephone Company'' that
brought the United States the best telephone service in the world
right up until it was broken up into Baby Bells.
</P>
<P>
   Now the government is on the verge of breaking up Microsoft into
Baby Bills.
</P>
<P>
   If Gates broke the law while he was getting rich bringing order
out of chaos, then he should be punished.
</P>
<P>
   Gates vows to fight on. But there's blood in the water, and the
lawyers are circling.
</P>
<P>
   The government said it won this victory for me and other
consumers.
</P>
<P>
   That's nice. I'll celebrate later.

   Q: What is the exact wording of the oath of office that every
member of Congress must take?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Constitution requires that senators and representatives
take this oath: ``I do solemnly swear that I will support and
defend the Constitution of the United State against all enemies,
foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance
and to the same; that I will take this obligation freely, without
any mental reservation or purpose of evasion and that I will well
and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am
about to enter. So help me God.''
</P>
<P>
   The specific language is set by statue enacted by Congress (5
U.S.C. 3331). U.S. law requires that members must be sworn in
before they can take their seats.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are the Peabody Awards conferred in New York and not at
the University of Georgia where they originated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only time the Peabody Awards ceremony has been held in
Georgia was 10 years ago in Atlanta to mark the 50th year of the
competition. Tom Hoover, activities director for the Peabody
Awards, said the annual ceremonies are held in New York where cable
and network headquarters are situated.
</P>
<P>
   UGA's College of Journalism started the competition that
recognizes distinquished achievement and public service in the
broadcast media. The organization is still based in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   Named for philanthropist and banker George Foster Peabody, the
first awards were given to the best broadcasters in radio in 1940.
It has grown to an international competition that has had more than
40,000 entries. A national advisory board meets at the university
the end of March each year to judge the best in radio and
television. This year, 36 awards will be given at ceremonies at the
Waldorf Astoria May 22. The awards were announced March 30.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do all states observe Daylight Saving Time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Daylight Saving Time is not observed in Arizona, Hawaii or
the Eastern time zone portion of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The idea originated with Benjamin Franklin, who wrote a humorous
essay in 1784 about saving time. The concept of adding an hour to
each day wasn't advocated strongly, though, until 1907 when an
English builder wrote a pamphlet, ``The Waste of Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Saving fuel became important during World War I, when many
European countries and the United States mandated Daylight Saving
Time. But it proved to be unpopular in this country, and was
repealed in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   It resumed in the United States during World War II when
year-round Daylight Saving Time was observed from February 1942
through September 1945. It was not used consistently again in this
country until President Johnson signed the Uniform Time Act of
1966. Additional federal legislation in 1986 set Daylight Saving
Time to begin at 2 a.m. the first Sunday of April and end 2 a.m.
the last Sunday of October.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the lady who sings the title song in the
``Goldfinger'' movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: Welsh-Nigerian diva Shirley Bassey hit the charts in 1964
with the title song from the James Bond movie ``Goldfinger.'' The
61-year-old singer had her first hit in 1957 with a calypso-style
``Banana Boat Song'' Recognized for her throaty sound, she
continues to record and perform in concerts around the world. She
will be presented to Queen Elizabeth II this spring as Dame Shirley
Bassey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported that QPM, or Quality Protein Maize, was
being introduced in countries around the world. An article about
the Carter Presidential Center said this strain had several
benefits over regular corn. Why isn't QPM used in this country?
</P>
<P>
   A: Compared to people in developing countries, Americans don't
need QPM _ which is a genetically engineered corn with amino acids
added _ because we get enough protein in our normal diet, said
Carrie Harmon of the Carter Presidential Center. QPM has the same
dietary advantages of meat and milk together, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for those people in this country who don't get enough
protein in their diet, soybean and other supplements are readily
available and inexpensive, which isn't the case in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last September, former President Jimmy Carter
said corn is the primary food for poor people, even though it is
``food-deficient.'' QPM, on the other hand, is ``a complete food,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   It has been introduced in Ghana, South Africa, Brazil and
nothern China, with plans also announced for North Korea to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I receive my mail at a post office box and didn't get a
census form. When I inquired at the post office, I was told that
people who get mail at a box there won't receive a census form. Is
this so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bea Piddock of the Census Bureau confirmed that census forms
are delivered to ``housing units,'' and not to post office boxes.
She suggests that you not call the bureau to request that a form be
hand-delivered to your residence, but wait for someone to visit
personally to conduct the enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are prisoners being counted in the census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census Bureau counts them at the prison. Inmates are
listed as residents of the location of the prison, not the location
where they lived before incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed many times that microwave ovens in public-use
areas are dirty, with food splattered inside from previous users.
Are there any health risks involved? Can harmful bacteria grow in
this mess?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like any dirty counter top or kitchen surface, a dirty
microwave could provide an opportunity for bacterial growth and
pest infestation, said Connie Crawley of the University of Georgia
Extension Service. But she said she has never seen any studies
indicating potential dangers of dirty microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
   If the oven is used frequently, the repeated heating likely
would destroy some bacteria, she said; but if it's used less
frequently, bacteria could start to grow.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that manufacturers always recommend regular cleanup of
any spills to maintain oven efficiency and hygiene, including the
top of the oven, where food may splatter, but isn't as visible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear news commentators, when talking about
politicians, use the term ``litmus test.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Anyone who has taken a high school chemistry class will
recall dipping a piece of litmus _ from the Scandinavian word for
lichen _ paper into a solution. In such a test, the paper turns red
in acid, blue in alkaline.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, a litmus test is a position or vote so closely
associated with a political philosophy that it immediately
classifies a politician or movement. The phrase became common in
this context in the 1970s. At the time, the most frequently
discussed litmus test was a Republican's position on the Panama
Canal treaties of 1977, which supporters of Ronald Reagan said
would determine whether any candidate would get the 1980
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples: A Democrat's litmus test was the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill to reduce unemployment; a Republican's was
the Equal Rights Amendment for women.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the phrase most often was applied to the selection
of Supreme Court justices. That litmus test was their attitude
toward abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to get a videotape copy of the 2000 Grammy
awards program?
</P>
<P>
   A: No such video is available, but Adam Sandler of the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences says a DVD release about the
42nd annual Grammy Awards show is in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   It likely would highlight certain artist performances, have some
key artist interviews, and provide a view of behind-the-scenes
action, among other features, he added.
</P>
<P>
   No release date has been set, but if you like to cruise online,
you can monitor the situation at www.Grammy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of the Enterprise, America's first space
shuttle? I'm going to Washington this summer and would like to see
it if it's on display anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A: While OV-101, as Enterprise is known in NASA lingo, never
went into space, it's considered a cornerstone of U.S. space
shuttle development.
</P>
<P>
   After it was used in various stages of testing, Enterprise made
a series of appearances at air shows in the United States, Europe
and Canada before being turned over to the Smithsonian
Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington. NASA
says it's currently in storage at Dulles International Airport near
Washington, so you won't be able to see it this summer. When
construction is completed on a museum annex, however, it will go on
view, along with other large and historic aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Many other early spacecraft, used in programs such as Mercury,
Gemini and Apollo, can be viewed at NASA institutions and science
museums around the nation. The Apollo 11 command module, for
example, is a popular exhibit at the Air and Space Museum, so you
can see that during your Washington visit.

 &HT;    A splash of wine uncorks a world of flavor
 &HT;    By Ann Heller and Mark Fisher
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ There's a secret ingredient lurking in your
basement_ or perhaps in your refrigerator door.
</P>
<P>
   You might not have used it lately to cook with, preferring to
consume it in its raw form. But wine has earned a place on your
kitchen countertop as well as the dining room table.
</P>
<P>
   The same flavors that make wine appealing to sip also make it a
tasteful addition to sauces, meats and desserts. It's a crucial
ingredient in classic stews such as Beef Bourgignon, Coq au Vin and
Osso Buco. But don't let the fancy names intimidate. Cooking with
wine can be amazingly simple, its impact profound.
</P>
<P>
   Pan-frying (oops, we mean sauteing) a fish filet, steak, chicken
breast or pork chop? Remove the meat, keep the burner on and pour
in equal parts wine and low-sodium chicken broth _ about 1/4 cup
each. Scrape the pan to free the tasty little browned bits. Cook
for a couple of minutes to reduce the liquid by about half, then
whisk in a tablespoon of butter. Pour over the main course.
</P>
<P>
   Want to pump it up a notch? Saute a teaspoon or two of chopped
shallots (or mild onion) with the wine and stock, perhaps with a
pinch of freshly minced garlic to add some new flavors.
</P>
<P>
   Your simple pan-fried entree just got much more interesting.
</P>
<P>
   Some other recipes demand a bit more time, but the results make
the effort worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   We could go on. Wine is essential in everyday marinades. A
splash of wine adds flavor to the mussels in the pot. A shot of
sherry added to the turtle soup is traditional. Poaching pears in
wine is as basic as Desserts 101.
</P>
<P>
   Cookbook author and chef John Ash makes the the case for cooking
with wine in a line or two poached from the book ``History of
Food'' by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wine puts all its nutritional virtues at the service of the
cooking and digestion of food. Wine contains glycerine, so it helps
to bind sauces and less fat can be used. Wine is well flavored and
allows the cook to go easy on salt or omit it altogether. Wine
contains tannin, particularly when it has been cooked, and
stimulates digestion. Wine contains alcohol, but very little once
it has evaporated in being cooked. It stimulates the tastebuds and
thus the appetite. It brings out the flavor of food and helps the
system to digest fat. And it is very good for morale.''

<P>
   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com

</P>
<P>
   Q: Are professional hockey players required to wear protective
headgear, or is it optional? I know goalies wear face masks.
</P>
<P>
   A: All NHL and minor league players must wear a helmet. Goalies,
by the way, wear more than face masks. Their protection includes
leg pads, a padded catching glove and a blocker (blocking glove),
which is used to hold the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does Georgia, the Peach State, rank among other states
in peach production?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's safe to say that Georgia consistently ranks among the
top five states. Beyond that, several factors figure into peach
crop production, making the rankings subject to change from year to
year. The main variable is the weather.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Georgia had a ``near normal'' year, resulting in a No.
2 ranking behind California, said Faith Peppers of the University
of Georgia Extension Service. In 1998, crops suffered damage from
hail and freezing weather, making the crop that year the
second-lowest in the past seven years. Georgia tumbled into a tie
with Pennsylvania for No. 4. California remained first, followed by
South Carolina and New Jersey. In 1999, Georgia was No. 2 again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Attorney General Janet Reno, appearing on CNN in connection
with the Elian Gonzalez case, seemed to be shaking constantly.
What's wrong with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The attorney general announced in November 1995 that she has
Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological disease that can
cause trembling, muscular stiffness, stooped posture, poor balance
and slow movement. The disease, for which there is no cure, starts
relatively mildly _ in Reno's case, with occasional shaking in the
left hand _ and continues in a relentless deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has experienced several well-publicized fainting
spells, her doctors have said repeatedly that Reno is in good
health, except for the Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The National Rifle Association created a controversy when it
published some statistics about crime in Australia. What was the
reaction of the Australians?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's what happened after the NRA posted a video on its Web
site about gun crimes in Australia. Presented as a television news
story, the video claimed that Australia's gun reform laws
backfired, and said gun-related crime rates rose after the country
banned semiautomatic rifles, semiautomatic shotguns and pump-action
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials accused the NRA of misrepresentation, and
demanded that the video be pulled and any reference to Australia
dropped. In a letter to NRA president Charlton Heston, Australia's
federal attorney general, Daryl Williams, wrote: ``I find it quite
offensive that the NRA is using the very successful gun reform laws
introduced in 1996 as the basis for promoting ownership of firearms
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia adopted the gun laws after an April 1996 rampage by
Martin Bryant, who opened fire with military-style rifles in
Melbourne, killing 35 people.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA didn't return Q&AMP;A's call asking for its response, but
the video appears to have been pulled from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Parade magazine recently had a brief mention about the old
Stanley Steamer automobile. By definition it must have been
steam-powered, but how did it work?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vehicle had a boiler under its hood that provided
pressure to drive a two-cylinder engine beneath the floor. Because
of its abundant torque, the Stanley Steamer _ named after its
inventors, twin brothers Francis and Freelan Stanley _ didn't have
a transmission. Just one gear engaged the center of its crankshaft
and directly turned the rear wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Steamers had several disadvantages, including being slow to warm
up. Driving also was difficult, requiring patience and knowledge to
manipulate the valves controlling the flow of fuel, water and
steam.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley company began producing steam automobiles in 1897.
With the appearance of Cadillac's self-starter, steam cars
gradually disappeared. In 1924, the Stanley brothers' company went
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I enjoyed the book ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil'' about Savannah. Is The Lady Chablis still performing there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Web site www.theladychablis.com/events.htm lists
these dates for personal appearances at Savannah's Club 1Jefferson
(named after its location at 1 Jefferson St.): April 22; May 27;
June 17; July 8; Aug. 12; and Sept. 2. Information: 912-232-0200.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're planning a trip to Alaska in May and are considering
driving west on the Trans-Canada Highway. How do gasoline prices in
Canada compare to those here?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Canadian Automobile Association says the national average
cost of gasoline is 71 cents (Canadian) a liter, which is how it's
sold. That is the equivalent of about $1.85 U.S. per U.S. gallon,
said Lauren DeWolf of the Canadian Consulate in Atlanta. She
pointed out that one U.S. gallon equals 3.875 liters; and $1 U.S.
equals 1.453 Canadian dollars, subject to fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Information about driving in Canada can be obtained by calling
the Canadian Automobile Association in Ottawa, Ontario, at
613-247-0117.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When are this year's space shuttle launches scheduled from
Cape Canaveral? Also, several years ago Q&AMP;A printed information
about obtaining a parking pass for better viewing. How is that
done?
</P>
<P>
   A: The schedule is being revised, so you'd be wise to check
frequently before making a trip. Information is available online at
www.ksc.nasa.gov, or you can call 321-867-4636 to listen to a
recording.
</P>
<P>
   As of March 28, information was available for only two launches,
both by Atlantis. The first is tentatively set for 6:37 p.m. April
18, with landing anticipated about 1:30 p.m. April 28. (The
recording, by the way, says launch will be ``no earlier than April
17 at 7:03 p.m.'').
</P>
<P>
   The second is tentatively planned at 4:57 p.m. Aug. 19, with
landing at 11:51 a.m. Aug. 30. Several other launches are planned,
but dates and times are listed as ``to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the shuttle launch car passes for this year
already have been allocated, according to the space center, and
requests for car passes beyond this year aren't being accepted.
However, a limited number of bus tickets to view the launches may
be available through Delaware North Park Services of Spaceport.
Information: 321-449-4444. No car passes or bus tickets are
available for viewing shuttle landings. Cloud cover frequently
makes landings more difficult to see than launches, and there's no
viewing area large enough to accommodate the public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Much has been written about gun locks, but I've never seen
how they work. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a number of variations, but one type that's
beginning to see widespread use in lock giveaways from Augusta to
Minneapolis resembles a bicycle cable lock. It has a metal cable,
coated in plastic, that hooks into a small key-operated padlock.
The device is pulled through gun handles or barrels. When the lock
is in place, the gun cannot be fired or loaded. This is different
from trigger locks, which keep the trigger from being pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Other types include digital locks, touch-sensitive combination
magazine and grip locks for semiautomatics and revolvers, and an
electronic trigger locking system encased in a tamper-resistant
polymer that covers the trigger and guard of most firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the California primary, the media had a lot to say
about the importance of the popular vote there. I never saw a
report with the exact number of votes for all the various
candidates. Do you have that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: These were the numbers in California's March 7 presidential
primaries, with vote totals followed by approximate percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Republican: George W. Bush,1,542,110 (61); John McCain, 885,255
(35); Alan Keyes, 100,173 (4); Steve Forbes, 7,505 (.2); Gary
Bauer, 6,039 (.2); Orrin Hatch, 5,421 (.2).
</P>
<P>
   Democratic: Al Gore,1,965,516 (81); Bill Bradley, 437,897 (18);
Lyndon LaRouche, 14,642 (1).
</P>
<P>
   Green: Ralph Nader, 20,727 (91.8); Joel Kovel, 1,873 (8.2).
</P>
<P>
   American Independent: Howard Phillips, 2,814 (100).
</P>
<P>
   Libertarian: Harry Browne, 7,961 (71.3); L. Neil Smith, 992
(8.9); Larry Hines, 842 (7.6); Dave Lynn Hollist, 721 (6.4); Kip
Lee, 656 (5.8).
</P>
<P>
   Natural Law: John Hagelin, 954 (100).
</P>
<P>
   Reform: Donald Trump, 659 (37.1); John Anderson, 424 (23.9);
Robert Bowman, 276 (15.5); Charles Collins, 219 (12.3); George
Weber, 201 (11.2).

<P>
   Q: What happened to popular Atlanta Braves shortstop Jeff
Blauser? Did he retire?
</P>
<P>
   A: Blauser, who played for the Braves from 1987 to 1997, is not
hooked up with any team this season. Braves spokesman Glen Serra
said Blauser, 34, became a free agent after the 1997 season and
then signed with the Chicago Cubs. He was released by them in 1999
after two seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the exact wording of the oath of office that every

<P>
   Q: Why are the Peabody Awards conferred in New York and not at
the University of Georgia where they originated?
</P>
<P>
   A: The only time the Peabody Awards ceremony has been held in
Georgia was 10 years ago in Atlanta to mark the 50th year of the
competition. Tom Hoover, activities director for the Peabody
Awards, said the annual ceremonies are held in New York where cable
and network headquarters are situated.

40,000 entries. A national advisory board meets at the university
the end of March each year to judge the best in radio and

</P>
<P>
   Q: Do all states observe Daylight Saving Time?
</P>
<P>
   A: Daylight Saving Time is not observed in Arizona, Hawaii or
the Eastern time zone portion of Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   The idea originated with Benjamin Franklin, who wrote a humorous
essay in 1784 about saving time. The concept of adding an hour to

Time. But it proved to be unpopular in this country, and was
repealed in 1919.
</P>
<P>
   It resumed in the United States during World War II when
year-round Daylight Saving Time was observed from February 1942
through September 1945. It was not used consistently again in this
country until President Johnson signed the Uniform Time Act of
1966. Additional federal legislation in 1986 set Daylight Saving
Time to begin at 2 a.m. the first Sunday of April and end 2 a.m.
the last Sunday of October.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who is the lady who sings the title song in the
``Goldfinger'' movie?
</P>
<P>
   A: Welsh-Nigerian diva Shirley Bassey hit the charts in 1964
with the title song from the James Bond movie ``Goldfinger.'' The
61-year-old singer had her first hit in 1957 with a calypso-style
``Banana Boat Song'' Recognized for her throaty sound, she
continues to record and perform in concerts around the world. She
will be presented to Queen Elizabeth II this spring as Dame Shirley
Bassey.
</P>
<P>
   Q: It has been reported that QPM, or Quality Protein Maize, was
being introduced in countries around the world. An article about
the Carter Presidential Center said this strain had several
benefits over regular corn. Why isn't QPM used in this country?
</P>
<P>
   A: Compared to people in developing countries, Americans don't
need QPM _ which is a genetically engineered corn with amino acids
added _ because we get enough protein in our normal diet, said
Carrie Harmon of the Carter Presidential Center. QPM has the same
dietary advantages of meat and milk together, she added.
</P>
<P>
   Also, for those people in this country who don't get enough
protein in their diet, soybean and other supplements are readily
available and inexpensive, which isn't the case in developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview last September, former President Jimmy Carter
said corn is the primary food for poor people, even though it is
``food-deficient.'' QPM, on the other hand, is ``a complete food,''
he added.
</P>
<P>
   It has been introduced in Ghana, South Africa, Brazil and
nothern China, with plans also announced for North Korea to get it.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I receive my mail at a post office box and didn't get a
census form. When I inquired at the post office, I was told that
people who get mail at a box there won't receive a census form. Is
this so?
</P>
<P>
   A: Bea Piddock of the Census Bureau confirmed that census forms
are delivered to ``housing units,'' and not to post office boxes.
She suggests that you not call the bureau to request that a form be
hand-delivered to your residence, but wait for someone to visit
personally to conduct the enumeration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How are prisoners being counted in the census?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Census Bureau counts them at the prison. Inmates are
listed as residents of the location of the prison, not the location
where they lived before incarceration.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I've noticed many times that microwave ovens in public-use
areas are dirty, with food splattered inside from previous users.
Are there any health risks involved? Can harmful bacteria grow in
this mess?
</P>
<P>
   A: Like any dirty counter top or kitchen surface, a dirty
microwave could provide an opportunity for bacterial growth and
pest infestation, said Connie Crawley of the University of Georgia
Extension Service. But she said she has never seen any studies
indicating potential dangers of dirty microwave ovens.
</P>
<P>
   If the oven is used frequently, the repeated heating likely
would destroy some bacteria, she said; but if it's used less
frequently, bacteria could start to grow.
</P>
<P>
   She noted that manufacturers always recommend regular cleanup of
any spills to maintain oven efficiency and hygiene, including the
top of the oven, where food may splatter, but isn't as visible.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I frequently hear news commentators, when talking about
politicians, use the term ``litmus test.'' What does that mean?
</P>
<P>
   A: Anyone who has taken a high school chemistry class will
recall dipping a piece of litmus _ from the Scandinavian word for
lichen _ paper into a solution. In such a test, the paper turns red
in acid, blue in alkaline.
</P>
<P>
   In politics, a litmus test is a position or vote so closely
associated with a political philosophy that it immediately
classifies a politician or movement. The phrase became common in
this context in the 1970s. At the time, the most frequently
discussed litmus test was a Republican's position on the Panama
Canal treaties of 1977, which supporters of Ronald Reagan said
would determine whether any candidate would get the 1980
presidential nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Other examples: A Democrat's litmus test was the
Humphrey-Hawkins bill to reduce unemployment; a Republican's was
the Equal Rights Amendment for women.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the phrase most often was applied to the selection
of Supreme Court justices. That litmus test was their attitude
toward abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is it possible to get a videotape copy of the 2000 Grammy
awards program?
</P>
<P>
   A: No such video is available, but Adam Sandler of the National
Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences says a DVD release about the
42nd annual Grammy Awards show is in the planning stages.
</P>
<P>
   It likely would highlight certain artist performances, have some
key artist interviews, and provide a view of behind-the-scenes
action, among other features, he added.
</P>
<P>
   No release date has been set, but if you like to cruise online,
you can monitor the situation at www.Grammy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What has become of the Enterprise, America's first space
shuttle? I'm going to Washington this summer and would like to see
it if it's on display anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   A: While OV-101, as Enterprise is known in NASA lingo, never
went into space, it's considered a cornerstone of U.S. space
shuttle development.
</P>
<P>
   After it was used in various stages of testing, Enterprise made
a series of appearances at air shows in the United States, Europe
and Canada before being turned over to the Smithsonian
Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington. NASA
says it's currently in storage at Dulles International Airport near
Washington, so you won't be able to see it this summer. When
construction is completed on a museum annex, however, it will go on
view, along with other large and historic aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Many other early spacecraft, used in programs such as Mercury,
Gemini and Apollo, can be viewed at NASA institutions and science
museums around the nation. The Apollo 11 command module, for
example, is a popular exhibit at the Air and Space Museum, so you
can see that during your Washington visit.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302, or e-mail

   Q: Are professional hockey players required to wear protective
headgear, or is it optional? I know goalies wear face masks.
</P>
<P>
   A: All NHL and minor league players must wear a helmet. Goalies,
by the way, wear more than face masks. Their protection includes
leg pads, a padded catching glove and a blocker (blocking glove),
which is used to hold the stick.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where does Georgia, the Peach State, rank among other states
in peach production?
</P>
<P>
   A: It's safe to say that Georgia consistently ranks among the
top five states. Beyond that, several factors figure into peach
crop production, making the rankings subject to change from year to
year. The main variable is the weather.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, Georgia had a ``near normal'' year, resulting in a No.
2 ranking behind California, said Faith Peppers of the University
of Georgia Extension Service. In 1998, crops suffered damage from
hail and freezing weather, making the crop that year the
second-lowest in the past seven years. Georgia tumbled into a tie
with Pennsylvania for No. 4. California remained first, followed by
South Carolina and New Jersey. In 1999, Georgia was No. 2 again.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Attorney General Janet Reno, appearing on CNN in connection
with the Elian Gonzalez case, seemed to be shaking constantly.
What's wrong with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: The attorney general announced in November 1995 that she has
Parkinson's disease, a degenerative neurological disease that can
cause trembling, muscular stiffness, stooped posture, poor balance
and slow movement. The disease, for which there is no cure, starts
relatively mildly _ in Reno's case, with occasional shaking in the
left hand _ and continues in a relentless deterioration.
</P>
<P>
   Although she has experienced several well-publicized fainting
spells, her doctors have said repeatedly that Reno is in good
health, except for the Parkinson's disease.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The National Rifle Association created a controversy when it
published some statistics about crime in Australia. What was the
reaction of the Australians?
</P>
<P>
   A: Here's what happened after the NRA posted a video on its Web
site about gun crimes in Australia. Presented as a television news
story, the video claimed that Australia's gun reform laws
backfired, and said gun-related crime rates rose after the country
banned semiautomatic rifles, semiautomatic shotguns and pump-action
shotguns.
</P>
<P>
   Australian officials accused the NRA of misrepresentation, and
demanded that the video be pulled and any reference to Australia
dropped. In a letter to NRA president Charlton Heston, Australia's
federal attorney general, Daryl Williams, wrote: ``I find it quite
offensive that the NRA is using the very successful gun reform laws
introduced in 1996 as the basis for promoting ownership of firearms
in the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Australia adopted the gun laws after an April 1996 rampage by
Martin Bryant, who opened fire with military-style rifles in
Melbourne, killing 35 people.
</P>
<P>
   The NRA didn't return Q&AMP;A's call asking for its response, but
the video appears to have been pulled from its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Parade magazine recently had a brief mention about the old
Stanley Steamer automobile. By definition it must have been
steam-powered, but how did it work?
</P>
<P>
   A: The vehicle had a boiler under its hood that provided
pressure to drive a two-cylinder engine beneath the floor. Because
of its abundant torque, the Stanley Steamer _ named after its
inventors, twin brothers Francis and Freelan Stanley _ didn't have
a transmission. Just one gear engaged the center of its crankshaft
and directly turned the rear wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Steamers had several disadvantages, including being slow to warm
up. Driving also was difficult, requiring patience and knowledge to
manipulate the valves controlling the flow of fuel, water and
steam.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanley company began producing steam automobiles in 1897.
With the appearance of Cadillac's self-starter, steam cars
gradually disappeared. In 1924, the Stanley brothers' company went
bankrupt.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I enjoyed the book ``Midnight in the Garden of Good and
Evil'' about Savannah. Is The Lady Chablis still performing there?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The Web site www.theladychablis.com/events.htm lists
these dates for personal appearances at Savannah's Club 1Jefferson
(named after its location at 1 Jefferson St.): April 22; May 27;
June 17; July 8; Aug. 12; and Sept. 2. Information: 912-232-0200.
</P>
<P>
   Q: We're planning a trip to Alaska in May and are considering
driving west on the Trans-Canada Highway. How do gasoline prices in
Canada compare to those here?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Canadian Automobile Association says the national average
cost of gasoline is 71 cents (Canadian) a liter, which is how it's
sold. That is the equivalent of about $1.85 U.S. per U.S. gallon,
said Lauren DeWolf of the Canadian Consulate in Atlanta. She
pointed out that one U.S. gallon equals 3.875 liters; and $1 U.S.
equals 1.453 Canadian dollars, subject to fluctuation.
</P>
<P>
   Information about driving in Canada can be obtained by calling
the Canadian Automobile Association in Ottawa, Ontario, at
613-247-0117.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When are this year's space shuttle launches scheduled from
Cape Canaveral? Also, several years ago Q&AMP;A printed information
about obtaining a parking pass for better viewing. How is that
done?
</P>
<P>
   A: The schedule is being revised, so you'd be wise to check
frequently before making a trip. Information is available online at
www.ksc.nasa.gov, or you can call 321-867-4636 to listen to a
recording.
</P>
<P>
   As of March 28, information was available for only two launches,
both by Atlantis. The first is tentatively set for 6:37 p.m. April
18, with landing anticipated about 1:30 p.m. April 28. (The
recording, by the way, says launch will be ``no earlier than April
17 at 7:03 p.m.'').
</P>
<P>
   The second is tentatively planned at 4:57 p.m. Aug. 19, with
landing at 11:51 a.m. Aug. 30. Several other launches are planned,
but dates and times are listed as ``to be determined.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the shuttle launch car passes for this year
already have been allocated, according to the space center, and
requests for car passes beyond this year aren't being accepted.
However, a limited number of bus tickets to view the launches may
be available through Delaware North Park Services of Spaceport.
Information: 321-449-4444. No car passes or bus tickets are
available for viewing shuttle landings. Cloud cover frequently
makes landings more difficult to see than launches, and there's no
viewing area large enough to accommodate the public.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Much has been written about gun locks, but I've never seen
how they work. Can you explain?
</P>
<P>
   A: There are a number of variations, but one type that's
beginning to see widespread use in lock giveaways from Augusta to
Minneapolis resembles a bicycle cable lock. It has a metal cable,
coated in plastic, that hooks into a small key-operated padlock.
The device is pulled through gun handles or barrels. When the lock
is in place, the gun cannot be fired or loaded. This is different
from trigger locks, which keep the trigger from being pulled.
</P>
<P>
   Other types include digital locks, touch-sensitive combination
magazine and grip locks for semiautomatics and revolvers, and an
electronic trigger locking system encased in a tamper-resistant
polymer that covers the trigger and guard of most firearms.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Before the California primary, the media had a lot to say
about the importance of the popular vote there. I never saw a
report with the exact number of votes for all the various
candidates. Do you have that information?
</P>
<P>
   A: These were the numbers in California's March 7 presidential
primaries, with vote totals followed by approximate percentages.
</P>
<P>
   Republican: George W. Bush,1,542,110 (61); John McCain, 885,255
(35); Alan Keyes, 100,173 (4); Steve Forbes, 7,505 (.2); Gary
Bauer, 6,039 (.2); Orrin Hatch, 5,421 (.2).
</P>
<P>
   Democratic: Al Gore,1,965,516 (81); Bill Bradley, 437,897 (18);
Lyndon LaRouche, 14,642 (1).
</P>
<P>
   Green: Ralph Nader, 20,727 (91.8); Joel Kovel, 1,873 (8.2).
</P>
<P>
   American Independent: Howard Phillips, 2,814 (100).
</P>
<P>
   Libertarian: Harry Browne, 7,961 (71.3); L. Neil Smith, 992
(8.9); Larry Hines, 842 (7.6); Dave Lynn Hollist, 721 (6.4); Kip
Lee, 656 (5.8).
</P>
<P>
   Natural Law: John Hagelin, 954 (100).
</P>
<P>
   Reform: Donald Trump, 659 (37.1); John Anderson, 424 (23.9);
Robert Bowman, 276 (15.5); Charles Collins, 219 (12.3); George
Weber, 201 (11.2).

 &HT;    What to pour (into the pan)
 &HT;    By Mark Fisher and Ann Heller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ So what kind of wine do you use in cooking?
</P>
<P>
   First off, never ever pour anything labeled ``cooking wine.''
Take one sip of that and you'll spit it out.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom is to use the same wine or the same varietal
you'll be serving with dinner. But what if you're not having a
glass with dinner?
</P>
<P>
   There are still options. A quarter-cup of dry vermouth often
will do when a splash of white wine is called for. So will Marsala
_ either dry or sweet _ or nutty Madeira. Because of their higher
alcohol content, all three can be kept on the shelf once opened.
</P>
<P>
   Another good tip: At the end of a meal when there's some wine
left in the bottle, pour it into an ice-cube tray and freeze it,
just the way you should do with excess chicken broth. Keep the
frozen cubes in well-sealed freezer bags and you've always got a
little wine when the recipe calls for just 1/4 or 1/2 a cup. Be
aware that because of the alcohol, the wine doesn't freeze as rock
hard as water.
</P>
<P>
   You wouldn't want to thaw and drink the wine, but it's OK for
cooking.

 &HT;    Texas' scads of new millionaires thirst to wet their palates
with costly wine
 &HT;    By Dale Rice
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ One night after dinner at Ruth's Chris Steak
House, the owners of the upscale eatery were talking to a young
Austin entrepreneur who has made millions in the high-tech field.
</P>
<P>
   The twenty-something executive told them he had an idea.
</P>
<P>
   He said he knew a tremendous number of young people in the
computer industry who've acquired a lot of money quickly. They have
the expendable income to buy fine wines but don't have much
knowledge to go along with it.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth's Chris, he suggested, could help by developing a way to
educate his colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   So the restaurant _ whose wine list has been lauded by Wine
Spectator magazine _ launched a special program last month.
</P>
<P>
   Every Tuesday night, Ruth's Chris opens three fine wines and
pours them in the front lounge for customers to sample _ at $25 to
$50 a glass. The first night, 20 people tried the wines that
ordinarily are not available by the glass. Later when they went in
the dining room for dinner, they ordered six bottles of one of the
wines and three bottles of another _ paying more than $100 a bottle
for wine they liked.
</P>
<P>
   It's the sip of the times _ an outpouring of riches _ as a
robust economy fueled by the technology sector transforms Austin
into a high-end wine market.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence is widespread _ from wine stores to restaurants to
special events like this week's pricey Texas Hill Country Wine and
Food Festival _ that area consumers have a thirst for top-dollar
vintages.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's money aplenty in Austin, Texas, right now, and people
are spending it on wine,'' says John Roenigk, owner of the Austin
Wine Merchant.
</P>
<P>
   Other retailers, wholesalers and restaurateurs agree, offering
example after example of the local boom.
</P>
<P>
   Rob Moshein, the wine buyer at Reuben's Emporium, recalls one of
them:
</P>
<P>
   A customer walked into a Reuben's and said, ``I'm going to a
dinner party at the home of a good friend who's into wine. What's
the best bottle you have?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What are you looking for?'' Moshein replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps I should rephrase the question,'' the man said.
``What's your most expensive bottle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``What type of wine do you want?'' Moshein asked, hoping to
narrow the choice to red or white.
</P>
<P>
   ``Perhaps you didn't hear me,'' the dinner guest said. ``What's
your most expensive bottle?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The '82 Obrion, at $425,'' Moshein said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll take it,'' the customer responded.
</P>
<P>
   It's like that across the city as customers reach repeatedly for
the top shelf.
</P>
<P>
   BEHIND THE BOTTLE
</P>
<P>
   It's a phenomenon that is being propelled by a number of
factors, some general to the world of wine, some particular to
Central Texas.
</P>
<P>
   The general issues include the high quality of California wine
in recent years, the laws of supply and demand and the hefty
attention focused on some vineyards by national publications.
</P>
<P>
   And while they drive up the cost of a bottle of wine, something
else must account for the willingness of people to purchase at
those prices.
</P>
<P>
   In Central Texas, wine sellers agree, there are two factors at
work: the healthy economy with its sizzling high-tech industry that
is making fortunes for individuals and the wine culture that has
developed, making Austin one of the leading wine cities in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin is a hotbed,'' says Leon Cikota, who oversees fine wine
sales at San Antonio-based Block Distributing. ``People are
clamoring for quality wine.''
</P>
<P>
   One sign of Austin's stature in wine circles, Cikota says, is
the number of vintners who come to the Capital City to personally
ply their wares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin,'' he says, ``is way ahead of the curve when it comes
to having celebrity wine makers visit the market.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those wine makers have been the focus of attention in
national publications such as the Wine Spectator, Wine Advocate and
Wine Enthusiast, Roenigk notes. High ratings and praise encourage
more consumers to seek out those special wines, bringing supply and
demand into play.
</P>
<P>
   Look what has happened to Caymus Napa Valley Cabernet Sauvignon,
for example. The retail price of the 1991 vintage was $22.50 a
bottle; the '96 price was $68.75. Or the Chateau Lafite Rothschild
first-growth Bordeaux. The 1992 vintage was $40 a bottle; the '97
was $200. And in the case of Lafite, that price is for people who
ordered the wine before it was even released by the vineyard.
</P>
<P>
   Does that deter Austin aficionados?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nope,'' Cikota says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Austin is a gold mine; it's paradise.''
</P>
<P>
   WHAT THE MONEY BUYS
</P>
<P>
   What do you get when you spend $100 or more on a bottle of wine?
</P>
<P>
   The paramount item is exclusivity. These are the wines produced
in small quantities, with great care and attention from the vine to
the bottle.
</P>
<P>
   While high price is closely tied to rarity, many collectors and
consumers associate it with quality as well. The assumption is that
the more you pay, the better the taste.
</P>
<P>
   That, however, is not always the rule. Several area experts
privately confide that in many cases they could not pick the most
expensive wine in a blind tasting.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that's what many drinkers crave. High-dollar wine.
</P>
<P>
   DEMAND IN THE STORES
</P>
<P>
   They want those exclusive wines so bad at Central
Market-Westgage that wine manager April Lowe has been forced to
create a collectors' file to ration ``allocated wines,'' the
short-supply, high-end wines limited to a few bottles or a few
cases per retailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're getting less and less every year,'' Lowe says, ``and
people want more and more.''
</P>
<P>
   To deal with that demand, Lowe calls collectors when a special
wine arrives and tells them that the first through the door will
get a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just collectors with a thirst for the fine stuff.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe recently decided to conduct a wine tasting on the spur of
the moment. She put up one 8 1/2-by-14-inch poster advertising the
sampling of Italian wines that ranged from $35 to $60 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   The $25-a-person tasting sold out in less than 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   That enthusiasm is widespread.
</P>
<P>
   At Grape Vine Market, according to co-owner Chuck Huffaker,
customers regularly buy expensive Italian wines, such as Gaja,
which ranges from $120 to $275 a bottle, and Quintarelli, which
runs from $33 to $175.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming in and asking for it by name,'' Huffaker
says. ``That wasn't happening a couple of years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   He's also seeing more young people interested in wine. One of
his customers recently walked out with $3,000 in Bordeaux, and ``he
was 30 years old at most,'' Huffaker says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of activity like that, he says, ``the average bottle
price has increased dramatically compared to what people were
purchasing three years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   OUTPRICING THE FOOD
</P>
<P>
   That change has spilled into restaurants in a big way.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have the money,'' says Ruth's Chris co-owner Gary
Porfirio. ``They don't just ask for quality wine anymore; they
demand it.''
</P>
<P>
   To meet that desire, Ruth's Chris has more than 200 wines at
$100 or more per bottle, including a vertical selection of Opus One
that runs from $260 to $1,000 a bottle. The restaurant also pours
more than 50 wines by the glass, including a 1975 port at $75 for 3
ounces.
</P>
<P>
   That makes the local steakhouse one of the leading wine sellers
in the Ruth's Chris chain, according to local co-owner Greg Davey.
Davey, who was corporate vice president for franchising, says the
wine-by-the-glass program in Austin is the most extensive of any
Ruth's Chris in the world.
</P>
<P>
   One reason that happens in Austin is attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``People here are looking for quality,'' says Ron Weiss,
co-owner of Jeffrey's Restaurant. ``They want to put good things in
their body. They want to treat themselves. They want to try the
finest things they can afford.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, according to Sullivan's Steak House manager
Tachella McClain, diners rarely knew about the Far Niente Cave
Collection or Silver Oak.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now they're coming in and asking for it as soon as they sit
down,'' she says. ``We have to sell the Silver Oak for $180 a
bottle, and they're buying it up like nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   McClain says expensive wines are a recruiting tool used by
businesses to help lure people to Austin. ``Businesses want to
impress them,'' she says. ``They're recruiting people from larger
cities. It shows Austin is sophisticated, too.''
</P>
<P>
   The same appeal is showing up at Zoot.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of weeknight customers at the small American bistro
are there for business dinners, much of them high-tech, says owner
Erika Brown. And what a difference that makes.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, about 20 percent of the wine sold in the
restaurant was high-end (more than $85 a bottle). Three years ago,
it was 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have days now _ especially weekdays _ where it's almost 85
percent high-end wine,'' Brown says. ``It's unbelievable.''
</P>
<P>
   SOPHISTICATION ABOUNDS
</P>
<P>
   A man in faded wranglers, scuffed boots and a Stetson walked
into Reuben's and asked Moshein if he had any Lunche Bages in
stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' Moshein said, adding he had it at $70 a bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great,'' said the man with the drooping mustache. ``I'll take
the case.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be emblematic of Austin's wine development.
</P>
<P>
   ``This city knows its wine,'' Moshein says. ``We're no
tidewater.''
</P>
<P>
   A FEW TIPS FOR $$$ SIPS
</P>
<P>
   Want to spend more than $100 on a bottle of wine, but don't have
any idea what to select? Here are some recommendations of local
experts:
</P>
<P>
   _ Musigny Joseph Drouhin 1997 ($160): ``It's all of what's fine
about red Burgundy wrapped in one package. There is an interplay of
spice and berry that transcends what the wine is made of.'' _ John
Roenigk, owner of Austin Wine Merchant
</P>
<P>
   _ Quintarelli Alzero 1993 Cabernet Franc ($150): ``This is one
of the best producers of the Valpolicella (Italy) area. He makes
wonderful wines in limited production, with quality throughout.'' _
Chuck Huffaker, co-owner of Grape Vine Market
</P>
<P>
   _ Chateau Cos d'Estournel 1982 ($260): ``It is classic
Saint-Estephe Bordeaux of a great year and it's at its peak to
drink right now. It's the perfect Bordeaux experience without
cellaring.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Rob Moshein, wine buyer at Reuben's Emporium
</P>
<P>
   _ Avignonesi Vin Santo 1988 ($149.99 for a half bottle): ``This
Italian dessert wine is heady and miraculous, better than Chateau
d'Yquem, the greatest wine of Sauternes in the Bordeaux region of
France.''
</P>
<P>

   COXNET FOOD 0404 -- Welcome to the world of the vegans. Vegans
(pronounced VEE-guns) are the most hard-core of the various types
of vegetarians. They choose to free their dinner plates of animal
products for a variety of reasons: health, environmental, ethical.
But, in taking their stand, they make changes in their dining out
and grocery selections. (Crider, Austin American Statesman) Art

 &HT;    Recipes using wine are well worth a try

   DAYTON, Ohio _ Wine figures in many a seafood recipe, whether
poaching salmon or making a fish soup. Inevitably, a simple
appetizer of mussels relies on some wine in the pot.
</P>
<P>
   This recipe comes from Preston Vineyards, where owner Lou
Preston suggests using their Dry Creek Valley Semillon. The simple
instructions suggest heating virgin olive oil in a small pan,
tossing in some garlic and parsley and cooking until it sizzles. A
couple of handfuls of mussels are added, and when they open, a bit
of Semillon is dashed over them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Toss everything about like a chef gone wild,'' the recipe
reads.
</P>
<P>
   Here are more precise instructions. For a mildly sinful sauce,
add a couple of tablespoons of cream with the wine.
</P>
<P>
   MUSSELS WITH WHITE WINE AND GARLIC
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 appetizer servings
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons minced parsley
</P>
<P>
   40 mussels, about 2 pounds
</P>
<P>
   mussels, scrubbed and beard removed
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Semillon or other dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup whipping cream, optional
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   Additional minced parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a medium skillet or pot that has a lid. Add the
garlic and parsley and cook about 30 seconds. Don't let the garlic
brown. Add the mussels and cover. Cook, shaking the pan repeatedly,
for 4 to 5 minutes, until the mussels open. Add the wine and cook,
shaking the pan, for about 1 minute. Remove mussels with slotted
spoon to individual soup plates, removing any mussels that haven't
opened. If using cream, add it to the pan and boil over high heat
for a minute. Add a couple of pinches of salt and pour the liquid
over the mussels. Sprinkle with parsley. Serve with chilled white
wine and crusty bread for dipping.

meat sauce. It's adapted from ``Essentials of Classic Italian
Cooking,'' by Marcella Hazan, (Alfred A. Knopf).
</P>
<P>
   PASTA WITH BOLOGNESE SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 to 6 first-course servings or 2 to 3 entrees
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter plus 1 tablespoon butter for tossing with
pasta
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup chopped celery
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup chopped carrot
</P>
<P>
   3/4 pound ground chuck
</P>
<P>
   Salt, black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup whole milk
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups canned Italian-style plum tomatoes chopped, with
their juice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 pound pasta, cooked according to package directions
</P>
<P>
   Freshly grated Parmesan cheese
</P>
<P>
   Heat butter and vegetable oil in large skillet over medium heat.
Add onion and cook until onions become translucent. Add celery and
carrot, and cook 2 minutes. Add meat, along with a large pinch of
salt and two grindings of pepper. Crumble meat with a fork, stir
well and cook until meat loses its red color. Add milk, let simmer
until milk evaporates. Add nutmeg and stir. Add wine and cook until
wine is evaporated. Add tomatoes, stir well. When the mixture
begins to bubble, turn heat down to simmer and cook for 3 hours,
checking and stirring occasionally. Add 1/2 cup water if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of cooking time, no water should be left in the pan.
Taste, add salt to taste. Add 1 tablespoon butter to cooked,
drained pasta and toss with sauce. Top with a sprinkle of grated
Parmesan.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The sauce portion of this recipe can be doubled or
tripled; leftover sauce freezes and reheats well.

   Red wine, specifically a Zinfandel, is used in both the marinade
and sauce for grilled lamb. Already-boned lamb, wrapped in a string
net, is available in most Kroger stores. Be sure to buy one that
has not already been seasoned. Then cut off the netting and unroll
the lamb. It will be uneven, but that's perfect for grilling
because some parts will become well done while others remain medium
rare. You can please everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to this early spring, mint is already 8 inches high in
any garden where it grows. It is also available in the herb section
of the produce section, as is fresh oregano. The sauce, while
flavored with mint, is a more sophisticated companion than
old-fashioned green mint jelly.
</P>
<P>
   GRILLED LAMB WITH ROASTED GARLIC-MINT SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   MARINADE:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup reduced-salt soy sauce
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Zinfandel
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup sliced yellow onions
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons chopped fresh oregano (or 1 teaspoon dried)
</P>
<P>
   1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   MEAT:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 leg of lamb, boned, butterflied and trimmed of most fat
(about 2 pounds)
</P>
<P>
   1 large whole head of garlic, unpeeled
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   SAUCE:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups Zinfandel
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups fat-free chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoons chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped roasted garlic
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   Mix all the marinade ingredients. Unwrap the lamb if it was
purchased in a string net. Place in a large, sealable plastic bag
and add marinade. Marinate, refrigerated, for at least 2 to 3
hours, turning the bag occasionally. Remove lamb from marinade and
pat dry.
</P>
<P>
   While the meat marinates, preheat oven to 350 degrees. Cut off
just the top of the garlic head, so that the individual cloves are
just exposed. Drizzle with the olive oil and sprinkle lightly with
salt and pepper. Wrap in aluminum foil, leaving a small area open
at the top. Roast for 45 to 60 minutes. Remove from oven and cool.
Squeeze the roasted garlic cloves out of the head, discarding the
skin. (Refrigerate unused roasted garlic, covered, for up to one
week.)
</P>
<P>
   To make the sauce, heat olive oil in a medium pan. Add shallots
and cook for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the wine, bring to a simmer and
boil until reduced by half. Add the stock, mint, roasted garlic and
mustard until the sauce is reduced by half. Season to taste with
salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Prepare a hot charcoal fire and grill lamb for 8 to 9 minutes
per side, until cooked medium rare, about 130 degrees. Let the lamb
rest for about 10 minutes before carving.
</P>
<P>
   Slice and spoon sauce over the lamb.

   Because of their sweetness, desserts and wines are a hard match.
But sometimes wine is incorporated in the final course. This
dessert recipe for jellied champagne and fruit served in wine
glasses was a fad during the holidays. Now you can use the
California strawberries that are in season.
</P>
<P>
   STRAWBERRIES
</P>
<P>
   IN CHAMPAGNE JELLY
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   4 1/4 teaspoons unflavored gelatin
</P>
<P>
   1 cup water
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 bottle (3 1/2 cups) dry champagne
</P>
<P>
   1 pint strawberries, rinsed, hulled and sliced
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle the gelatin over the water in a medium saucepan and let
soften for about 5 minutes. Put the pan over low heat and stir with
a wooden spoon just until the gelatin has dissolved. Stir in all
but 1 tablespoon of the sugar and remove from the heat. Stir until
the sugar has thoroughly dissolved, then stir in the champagne.
Pour the mixture into a shallow bowl; cover and refrigerate until
set, at least 6 hours.
</P>
<P>
   When ready to serve, combine the strawberries with the remaining
1 tablespoon sugar. Scramble the gelatin with a fork. Spoon 3
tablespoons of the jellied champagne into individual wine glasses
and top with a layer of berries. Repeat two more times. Drizzle a
little juice from the berries over the top. Serve cold.
</P>
<P>
   (Note: if you make this a day ahead and refrigerate overnight
you can use only 3 1/4 teaspoons gelatin).
</P>
<P>
   Approximate nutritional analysis per serving: 228 calories, no
fat or cholesterol, 10 mg sodium.

VILLAGE EXISTS ON ECONOMY OF SCALES

   KASENYI, Uganda _ The auction starts right on the boat. Men bump
and shout, waving fans of worn bills. Some teeter on the gunwales.
Others stand waist-deep in the water or haggle from the shoulders
of others. A tax man hovers, collecting his cut at the conclusion
of each transaction.
</P>
<P>
   In a country whose shape is determined by the northwestern
shoreline of Lake Victoria, a body of fresh water that could almost
swallow Maine, nothing edible sets Uganda in motion more than fish.
And in this fishing village, the largest and most productive near
the capital of Kampala, buying and selling follow two simple rules:
Freshness lies in the color of the gills and price is a function of
proximity to water.
</P>
<P>
   Ugandans pull, on average, 135,000 tons of fish from Lake
Victoria annually, according to government statistics. Most of that
haul is brought in by small commercial fishermen who often spend
their nights on the water in ``kabalegas,'' long narrow boats,
guarding their nets from pirates. Their catches spawn vibrant _ and
often pungent _ lakeside marketplaces.
</P>
<P>
   If bees could catch fish, their hives might resemble this
fishing village, where the daily harvest and the crushing human
need for work result in a highly specialized division of labor. The
arrival of each boat sets in motion a frenetic bustle of
auctioneers, buyers, mongers, waders, tax collectors, fish
cleaners, ice packers, boat tenders, tallymen, money changers, and
net menders.
</P>
<P>
   All that just to beach the catch. The journey from fish to
fillet slips through many hands.
</P>
<P>
   Kasenyi wakens slowly. In the calm of early morning, Africa's
largest lake pats the shore like a cat licking its paw. The
fishmongers' tables lie empty, the merchants' kiosks shut tight.
Smoke curls up from the jumbled wooden dwellings that huddle
tightly a hundred yards up the beach. Young boys fill yellow cans
with water. The first returning fishermen, back from a night on the
water, untangle their catch, mend their nets, share tips on where
the fish might be.
</P>
<P>
   The beachcombers come first, sweeping the sand of the previous
day's flotsam and refuse. Then the merchants come, lifting the
shutters from their clapboard hovels: Kagozi's general store,
Okello's cafe, Kasenyi Village Pharmaceutical. Soon, the beach will
be a swarm. Women from inland villages hawking onions and bright
orange peppers; women from Kasenyi grilling chicken livers, five
cents a skewer; women selling beautiful sarongs with matching
headdresses.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the beach, in the grassy dunes, Kiyonga Leonard and his
laborers build kabalegas from rough-milled planks of blond mukebo
wood. The boats are 35 feet long and three times deeper than
canoes, sealed tight with inner tubes, twine, oil paint, and sheet
metal.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard shrugs more than he talks. ``I make about a hundred
boats a year,'' he said, lifting his Chicago Bulls cap to wipe his
brow. ``They last about five years.''
</P>
<P>
   By midday, the fish tables at the water's edge sag and sway
under the weight of the day's catch. Mounds of tilapia as plump as
couch cushions, some still twitching, lie under a tablecloth of
banana leaves. Nile perch gape in the humid heat, their huge fleshy
tongues jutting outward. The only shade is under the tables, where
fishmongers fend off the day in the company of their women.
</P>
<P>
   Haggling starts as soon as the boats cut their motors. Here, a
platter-sized tilapia might cost 30 cents, and if you don't want to
get wet, you can hire a wader and ride out to the kabalega on his
shoulders. Five feet up the beach, after the same tilapia has
already been bought and sold twice, the cost rises to a dollar. In
downtown Kampala the price is about $6.
</P>
<P>
   No matter the niche, the days are long, the money little.
Fishermen work 12-hour days and barely cover their costs. Young
boys clean fish for nothing but tips.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Kagwa, a wader, buys fish off the boat, carries it to
shore, and sells it to the fishmongers at the tables. ``I load and
offload, 8 a.m. to 7 p.m.,'' he said. ``Maybe I get a few dollars a
day. Anyway, I survive.''

KRISTINA KOZNICK'S FANTASTIC FINISH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TONY CHAMBERLAIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After two back-to-back slalom wins to put a blazing finale on
her World Cup season for the US Ski Team last month, Kristina
Koznick had all but forgotten what a short leap it had been from
the lowest point in her career.
</P>
<P>
   Life as she knew it pretty much ended for Koz on a warm wet day
in Nagano, Japan, Feb. 26, 1998, when she got her weight thrown
back in a slalom gate and in a split second spun off the race
course into oblivion.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of skiers did and always do DNF in slalom. But these were
the Winter Olympic Games, and with very few bright spots on the US
team, Koz, the 21-year old from Burnsville, Minn., was just about
the last hope for a podium spot on the Alpine technical side.
</P>
<P>
   Picabo Street would take gold in the Super-G that year, but
Koznick had the US medal hopes riding high into the last race day
of the games. And she was to learn that day how the very word
Olympic transforms ``just one more ski race'' into a live-or-die
pressure cooker.
</P>
<P>
   To counteract the emotional supercharge of Nagano, Koz remembers
approaching the race casually. ``I kept telling myself it wasn't a
big deal, I'd be fine, not to make a big deal out of it,'' says
Koznick, a muscular 5-foot-7-inch, 157-pounder from the middle of
the nation's frozen plains country, ``and that's pretty much how I
skied that race. Like it was no big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the rest of the skiers in the world were making
it a very big deal, and by comparison to the elite class she skis
with, Koz was plain flat-out slow in the first run.
</P>
<P>
   ``So the second run I didn't have a choice. I had to go pretty
much all-or-nothing, and I went out (skied off course for a DNF). I
thought, `Oh no, my life is over.' It was a pretty tragic moment
for me. I couldn't believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   And so at the tender age of 22, after romping through her
formative years with eight junior titles in all four events, and
joining World Cup at age 15, the most promising American Woman
skier of a decade had hit a definite bump in the road.
</P>
<P>
   Still, she ended that season in second place in the final World
Cup standings, with her first World Cup finish in Are, Sweden,
among her four trips to the podium, and her fourth straight US
slalom title. Still, the Olympic non-performance was the story of
Koznick's long-awaited debutante year.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always say, `Oh you didn't win the Olympics. That was a
bad seson for you.' But,'' says Koz, ``I say, `No, it was a great
season for me.' Sure, I would have loved to do well in the
Olympics, but look at the rest of my season. The first race in Park
City was the only surprise for me all season. I knew I was capable
of being top three and I was fourth. But that was still a great
season for me, and I'll still get another shot at the Olympics.''
</P>
<P>
   But following her disappointing Olympics in 1998, Koznick's
career would tailspin deeper before she would hit bottom and start
on a comeback that found her soaring at the end of this season to
back-to-back wins.
</P>
<P>
   Koznick smiles easily and makes no excuses for herself. Like the
mythical Minnesotans in Garrison Keillor stories, she is
plain-talking and painfully honest at times, particularly when
assessing her own worst races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always look back at my bad races and learn an incredible
amount from them. And when I see what I did, that gives me real
growth and confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   She grew up skiing in the Erich Sailer's Buck Hill racing
program, one which taught skiers technical, quick, and aggressive
turns. She ended up ``skiing up,'' racing against skiers older than
herself. From the age of 12 through her teens, Koz won eight junior
championships, including, in 1991, the title in GS and Super-G. A
week later, she was asked to become the youngest member of the US
Alpine Ski Team.
</P>
<P>
   But Koznick says she will always consider Sailer her ``real''
coach. ``I say Erich Sailer was my first coach, but he really is
still my coach today and will be forever, even though we went our
separate ways when I made the national team. There's no one who
knows me better. We have that special connection that led me to my
optimum potential.''
</P>
<P>
   After the '98 season, in which she combined a nice consistency
over the winter with her disappointment at Nagano, the next year
was her worst on the circuit. Injuries and equipment problems
robbed her of the consistency she had the year before.
</P>
<P>
   In February at the Alpine Worlds in Vail, Koz fell one more
notch. Again, skiing as the United States' only medal hope at the
event, she filled the stands at the finish in Vail Village with
thousands of ski fans revelling in the Colorado sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   They grew expectant as her run became imminent and as she
started a huge roar went up. But as if a balloon popped, Koznick
again skied off course very early in the first run and the festival
atmosphere sagged. Koznick was not only inconsistent, but getting a
reputation for blowing the big races.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look back at both those races,'' she says, ``and I hear
people saying I can't ski in important events, but it's just based
on two events, and I learned so much from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``After last season I really started out this one in the hole,''
she says. ``I mean I almost wasn't qualifying. So I had to pull
myself together and be patient with my skis. I just learned so much
about confidence _ just who I am and what's going on with me.''
</P>
<P>
   The first part of this season was not the turnaround that
Koznick had hoped it would be, though her persistent back problem
seemed to be solved and she was in the greatest shape of her life
thanks to her efforts with a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   But now equipment problems were holding her back. She was skiing
on long straight edged skis at a time many racers were adopting a
shorter, slightly shaped ski.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started doubting myself, and before one race I grabbed a
pair of short skis and went down the course with perfect form. But
I was slow. Up to the middle of January, I switched skis before
every race, which is really not great for your consistency.''
</P>
<P>
   But then Koz switched ski companies to Voekl, began racing on a
slightly carved shaped 170cm model, and finally was ``with a ski
company that seemed excited to have me.''
</P>
<P>
   And, by the next month, the results started to come. In
February, Koz started to hit the top five with a fourth and a
second. Than came Sestriere, Italy, and in front of a friendly
crowd, she got her first win of the season, the third World Cup of
her career.
</P>
<P>
   Her second victory came a week later, and she became convinced
that her training had overcome her old injuries, and that her skis
were dialed the way she needed them to win races.
</P>
<P>
   ``What a day,'' she said about her second conseutive win. ``It
was a beautiful sunny day, and the skiing couldn't have been much
better. And just to end the season with two wins gives me such
confidence going into next season. That's going to be the test.
Next year I have to be consistent and get some good results looking
ahead to Salt Lake City. We're psyched to have the games in our own
country and want to be ready for them.''
</P>
<P>
   If the timing is right, says Koz, the next Olympics could be
good for the home team, at least on the women's side. Youngsters
like Sara Schleper and Caoline Lalive are following Koz toward the
leader list, and Picabo Street will be returning from a major knee
blowout, perhaps to do some gate racing rather than downhill.
</P>
<P>
   After shoulder surger this summer, Koz says, ``It may take a
month or more to recover, and then I just want to get on my skis
and start training. This was definitely the way to finish my
season.''

SPENCER TRACY: THE ACTOR'S ACTOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARTIN F. NOLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's actors, however skilled or even Oscar-honored, usually
let the audience know they are acting. They did not have James
Stewart's good luck in 1935 during his first film, ``Murder Man.''
The star, Spencer Tracy, advised him to forget about the camera.
The rest is Hollywood history.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Milwaukee on April 5, 1900, Spencer Bonaventure Tracy
was the actor's actor. He worked hard to make it look easy. ``You
don't see the mechanism working, the wheels turning,'' Humphrey
Bogart once said of him. ``He makes you believe what he is
playing.'' Did he just play himself with minor variations or did he
inhabit each role with unsurpassed skill? That is Tracy's secret,
which he took to his grave in 1967.
</P>
<P>
   His believability made biographical films succeed: ``Edison the
Man'' and ``Stanley and Livingstone.'' From romantic comedy in
``Libeled Lady'' and ``Woman of the Year'' to sturdy political
melodrama in ``State of the Union'' and ``The Last Hurrah,'' he was
also the complete actor.
</P>
<P>
   Two of his nine Oscar nominations came from playing priests,
Father Mullin in ``San Francisco,'' and Father Flanagan in ``Boys
Town.'' Only Bing Crosby got more mileage out of a Roman collar.
Tracy once astonished his pal, Frank McHugh, by telling him that
Irish Catholic guilt helped him play priests. He was the fiercest
drunk this side of W. C. Fields and would vanish, as he confessed,
``to take two-week lunches.''
</P>
<P>
   After toiling for 20th Century Fox and MGM, the film factories
of the 1930s, Tracy's two Oscars came back-to-back. In ``Boys
Town'' in 1938, he boxed Mickey Rooney's ears. In 1937, portraying
Manuel, a Portuguese fisherman, in ``Captains Courageous,'' he
looked, said Joan Crawford at the time, ``like Harpo Marx.'' Worse,
he sounded like Chico Marx. He rarely appeared in great movies,
which intensified the admiration of his fellow actors.
</P>
<P>
   A later movie shows a truer Tracy. In 1955, he starred in ``Bad
Day at Black Rock,'' which John O'Hara called ``one of the finest
motion pictures ever made.'' Tracy's character subdues notable
heavies Robert Ryan, Ernest Borgnine, and Lee Marvin.
</P>
<P>
   Who, after Spencer Tracy's century, can replace him? Joe
Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal says today's crop is ``more
mannered, much more facile, always actorly, while Tracy, Gary
Cooper, and those guys looked like they were plunked down on the
set.'' Morgenstern mentions John Cusack, ``who has that elusive
quality in an actor, what the Italians call `the art of concealing
art.' '' I tentatively nominate Sean Penn, once he shakes off early
mannerisms.
</P>
<P>
   David Thomson, a film historian who writes for London's
Independent, sees one older actor as ``the person who I would say
is Tracyesque. That is Gene Hackman, who is absolutely reliable.
There's the same privacy there that Tracy had. Neither man is
desperate that you should know him or like him.''
</P>
<P>
   Tracy ``was a leading man and yet he was not pretty,'' Thomson
says. ``He later benefited from his biggest fan, Katharine Hepburn.
Supposing they had not met each other? Their relationship started
when they were past the blush of youth.'' Indeed, Hepburn was
``Keeper of the Flame,'' the title of one of nine movies in which
they co-starred, from 1942 to 1967.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Kramer directed Tracy's final films. In Thomson's
``Biographical Dictionary of Film,'' the kindest adjective for
Kramer is ``pretentious.'' That is true of ``Judgment at
Nuremberg'' and the actor's last film, ``Guess Who's Coming to
Dinner?'' Shedding the advice of his mentor, George M. Cohan,
``Spencer, you have to act less,'' Tracy became preachy and
actorly.
</P>
<P>
   But in his prime, he had no peer. Nightclub comics once
impersonated stars like Bogey, Gable, and Cooper. ``I'm easy to
imitate,'' James Cagney said of his old pal, ``but you never saw
anyone imitate Spencer Tracy. You can't mimic reserve and control
very well.''

AS FAMILY AS IT GETS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Juan Miguel Gonzalez is the shadowy figure at the center
of the drama here: much discussed, never seen. In the four months
of the Elian saga, he has only occasionally been directly heard
from.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't stop some people from feeling as if they know him.
Many believe he is a caring father, but there are whispers now that
maybe the family knows things about him that are not so good. Some
believe he should have been here for his son months ago _ and would
have been, except that he is a communist, and communists care
nothing about kids. Others aren't so sure about that, and believe
he would apply for asylum himself at the first opportunity _ the
Disney ending so many here hope for.
</P>
<P>
   What the disparate camps have in common, of course, is that
their opinions are based on very little fact. Yet, in the tough
skirmish between the private and the political in this case, who
Juan Miguel is seems to matter more every day.
</P>
<P>
   From the beginning, this has been an easy issue for a lot of the
people who want Elian to stay in the United States. You don't send
back anyone who has escaped Castro, and that's that. Many of the
Cuban community here have lost family members to the seas or to
Castro's oppression. They are quick to point out that Elian's
mother died for his freedom.
</P>
<P>
   But the immiment arrival of Elian's father _ to Washington,
probably, if not Miami _ makes it all more complicated. It renders
the political deeply personal. If this is _ as the zealots at the
barricades endlessly maintain _ a family matter, Juan Miguel is as
family as it gets. Even some of those who have been perfecting
their human chain techniques for days now find it hard to say that
a child should not be reunited with his only living parent.
</P>
<P>
   The clash between two strongly held values in this community _
hatred of Fidel Castro and everything he stands for, versus respect
for the family _ is a conflict that has grown steadily more
gut-wrenching.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cruz is a 21-year-old member of the Democracy Movement, the
most visible organized group devoted to preventing Elian's return
to Cuba. Though they insist there will be no violence, Cruz and his
compatriots insist they are willing to lay down their lives, if
necessary, for Elian's cause. But he says the human chain will step
aside for Juan Miguel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would admire that,'' he said of such a visit. ``We would
receive him with flowers and no threats.''
</P>
<P>
   In absentia, Juan Miguel has begun to take a public relations
beating. The whispering campaign _ the charges that he beat Elian,
that he beat Elian's mother _ goes on in two languages. Elian's
Miami relatives have taken to insisting that he is afraid of his
father and begs daily not to be turned over to him.
</P>
<P>
   This after the family forcefully and repeatedly defended him as
a father through most of the course of events. Given many
opportunities to suggest that Juan Miguel was an unfit father, they
did just the opposite, stressing that he had remained a daily part
of Elian's life after divorcing his first wife.
</P>
<P>
   But that was back in the heady days of December and January,
when they believed they would prevail with ease, that Congress
would save them even if the Immigration and Naturalization Service
tried to press forward with the unthinkable demand that Elian go
back. There seemed so many avenues then, so many ways to win.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Elian's legal options are dwindling, trashing his
father has become the new strategy. If the Miami relatives can
maneuver the case into a state family court and persuade the
elected judge to accept allegations of abuse and perhaps worse,
then maybe they can still win. All this, of course, in support of
the best interests of the child.
</P>
<P>
   It seems the only way for them to win now is to destroy the
notion of family. But there are still two ways for Juan Miguel
Gonzalez to get his good name back. All he has to do is renounce
Fidel.
</P>
<P>
   Or his own son.

TO THE BAD GUYS IN THE ELIAN AFFAIR: LET THE KID GO HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Send the kid home. Now.
</P>
<P>
   To his father. To Cuba. To The Big Beard. To the place where he
belongs. Maybe not the right place by everyone's lights. But four
months of legal mumbo-jumbo, political pandering, and mouthy
protestations of altruistic intervention in this poor tyke's
confused life do not mask the greasy reality: Elian Gonzalez has
been hijacked and is our political prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we all know Elian's deceased mother fled Cuba for Florida;
she wanted out for herself and the boy. But some things are bigger
than politics. And parenthood is one of them.
</P>
<P>
   The father is the father. He deserves custody, by any reasonable
standard of family court practice in the modern world. The Cuban
community in Florida, exiles bitter at Castro and expert at
manipulating conservative anti-Castro sentiment, have turned the
kid into a political football, with predictable negative
consequences for the lad.
</P>
<P>
   When the mayor of Dade County goes on TV with 20 other mayors to
boast that that he'll never let his police be used to enforce
federal immigration law in this case, he betrays the sort of
loutish rule-or-ruin mindset that belongs in a totalitarian state,
not here. What is it about the Cuban-American propaganda
puppeteers? What part of our legal system is it that they don't
get?
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Gore's apparent capitulation to the political
lobby in Florida is disappointing. Gore wants Congress to pass a
special law granting permanent resident status to the boy, his
father, and five other relatives. That's Florida Democratic Senator
Bob Graham's political solution; that, and give the state's family
court system jurisdiction over Elian's ultimate custody, not the
federal Immigration and Naturalization Service. Gore defenders
shrug and say that's what Al thinks is right, too. And George W.
Bush makes three.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, Al, don't let those recent polling numbers in Florida
confuse you. Yeah, you're up by a handful over Bush in the land of
Mickey, mangroves, and Metamucil. But that ain't gonna last. Forget
about those 25 electoral votes.
</P>
<P>
   If you are to win Florida, you'll be winning about 43 other
states to boot. By November, the Florida governor, also named Bush,
will have shaved that lead of yours. Al, I know I was with John
McCain during the primaries. But I'll be with you in November, I'm
almost positive. George W. is not my cup of tea.
</P>
<P>
   But, Al, don't make it any harder than it has to be, for all
those of us who were looking elsewhere over the winter. Check out
what happened to Bush, after he ditched ``compassionate
conservatism'' for Bob Jones and McCain-bashing. Bush's once-comfy
lead among independents and women has gone poof!
</P>
<P>
   As Al From, the Democratic strategist of moderate _ and
therefore winning inclinations put it _ ``the way you win
Independents is with independence.'' Americans elsewhere have not
been stampeded by the Cuban contortions in Miami. The latest Gallup
Poll survey on CNN says 64 percent want Elian restored to his
father. That 2-1 verdict in the court of public opinion has been
virtually immovable over nearly half a year of political
tug-of-war.
</P>
<P>
   In an unsolicited discussion with a lower-ranking Clinton
administration political type, I was told that the Gore camp made
an apparent miscalculation about the views of Hispanic voters on
this sensational case. They are not monolithic; while Miami Cubans
want to hold on to the kid, the Mexican-Americans of the Southwest
and the Latin-Americans of the Northeast coalesce around the notion
that family is family and that fatherhood is too important to
overturn hundreds of centuries of hewing to that fact.
</P>
<P>
   It's fact-facing time: Two-thirds of Americans want the boy to
go back. His father wants him back. Bill Clinton wants him to go
back. Hillary, too. But the same gang of right-wingers who gave us
impeachment, the government shutdown, no action on gun control a
year after Columbine, and the wrangling over abortion has seized
this little kid for the crassest of political reasons. By their
motives shall we judge them.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Republican Party sent out fund-raising letters
predictably accusing the Clinton administration of ``cowardice''
and appeasing Castro. That was too much for Governor Jeb Bush, who
disowned the embarrassing letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor believes it was and is inappropriate to use Elian
Gonzalez for political purposes,'' said Jeb Bush's spokesman. Oh?
Yeah. Right.
</P>
<P>
   We are on the cusp of the nastiest political year since 1968.
Back then the rough stuff was in the streets. This year the dirty
game is in the suites. The Bush campaign has gone the sleaze route
from Day One against Clinton-Gore. The Gore campaign is equally
adept in areas that would cause the Marquess of Queensberry to
swoon. This is not a year for the faint-hearted voter. On the
matter of pandering to the 12 percent of Florida voters of
Cuban-American descent, both Bushes and now Gore have shown
profiles in discouragement.
</P>
<P>
   And don't tell me McCain would be any better on this issue. My
friend John had his chance and tanked too. Could it be something in
the water pumped in from the Okefenokee Swamp?

SEX PREY; STAR DIGS; THE DOUBTING DISEASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a creepola story in the April GQ called ``My Mentor, My
Rapist,'' and it's by a magazine writer who chooses to call himself
Anonymous. The piece charts his dawning awareness that his trusted
friend, a slightly older ``rising star at a big-city magazine''
whom he calls ``the tall man,'' was drugging him and then raping
him. Twice, the two men agreed to take the tall man's
hallucinogenic mushrooms, but the effect both times found
Anonymous, who is straight, waking up in the tall man's bed after
huge blacked-out gaps of time. Not very psychedelic. Anonymous's
next epic blackout came after a drink and a joint, and the final
episode was induced by a bowl of soup.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the increasingly suspicious Anonymous continue to spend
time with his friend? Haunted by his father's suicide, he wondered
if ``this blacking out, or this loss of memory, or this sexual
schizophrenia might be its shadow.'' Also, amid his friend's
denials, he had his urine tested for Rohypnol, aka Roofies, the
tasteless, colorless drug that has been in the news because of its
use by sexual predators. The results came back negative.
</P>
<P>
   A few years later, however, after breaking off with the tall man
and trying unsuccessfully to shake feelings of violation, Anonymous
has the same urine retested and, alas, the results reveal
concentrations of a hypnotic sedative called Restoril. Lost in
violent fantasies about retribution, he instead decides to call the
police, who quickly assure him that the tall man was a rapist and
that he exhibited familiar patterns of behavior. But, in a twist of
the knife that Anonymous doesn't elaborate on, the detectives don't
encourage him to press charges; Anonymous' recreational drug use
would ``trouble the D.A.'' And so the tall man, now the head of a
``new cyberventure,'' remains free.

   I won't even pretend I read Architectural Digest for the
articles. And this month's issue is a particularly fat and gorgeous
invasion of privacy called ``Hollywood at Home.'' The photo spreads
jump between now (Claire Danes, Samuel L. Jackson, William H. Macy)
and then (Clark Gable, Natalie Wood, Bing Crosby), and it's
interesting to note just how much simpler home glamour was back in
the black-and-white days. Does Mickey Rourke actually take off his
shoes and kick back in his gaudy, gilted, fringed, draped, and
monotonously maroon-colored pied-a-terre in New York?
</P>
<P>
   In The New Yorker for April 10, Jerome Groopman looks into what
the French call ``the doubting disease,'' and what we call
Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. He notes that many prominent
scientists exhibit traits of the disorder, and goes on to discuss
the matter with a series of experts. The piece is particularly
interesting in light of our eagerness to diagnose children with the
likes of Attention Deficit Disorder and give them drugs, and it
addresses what one psychologist calls the ``pathologizing of
people's behaviors.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   Speaking of obsessive behavior . . .
</P>
<P>
   When you don't even pause for a moment to scan an infinitely
long ``Boys on the Bus''-esque Rolling Stone meta-article about a
week with John McCain written by the 
so-brilliant-he-knows-he's-not-brilliant-which-is-what-makes-him-so-
brilliant author David Foster Wallace, an article whose subtext is
nothing less than American politics, Young Voter apathy, and, of
course, the media, and when you ignore David Fricke's beautifully
photographed Crosby, Stills, Nash &AMP; Young piece, which you later
discover is impressively honest and thorough and worthwhile for any
fan, semi-fan, or former fan, all just so that you can skip
directly to the junky celebrity profile of Julia Roberts, a
surprisingly late-in-the-game article that arrives a veritable
Hollywood eternity after the 32-year-old actress has already
appeared in almost every major glossy and newspaper promoting her
new movie, ``Erin Brockovich,'' quipping about the everpresent
cleavage and the everpresent tongue-wagging about the everpresent
cleavage, chatting oh-so-confidentially about her love affair with
Benjamin Bratt, and miraculously maintaining her wholesome-girl
image while peppering her comments with truck-driver expletives,
then you have to admit that you can understand how a mildly
talented actress with a horsey, 1000-watt smile can not only carry
a movie but inspire millions of fans to read about her over and
over again, in stories that all sound the same, in magazines that
all look the same, and that you instinctively understand the
meaning of star quality, circa 2000.

PROMOTERS SAY MAYHEM MIGHT HURT FUTURE TOURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was supposed to be a monumental collaboration _ one
that raised rap shows to a new level in terms of dollars spent and
money made, and for its emphasis on unity. The violence that
erupted in a backstage corridor at the Ruff Ryders/Cash Money show
Monday night at the FleetCenter was in tragically ironic
juxtaposition to the values of brotherhood and camaraderie espoused
by the two families that respectively run the Ruff Ryders and Cash
Money record labels.
</P>
<P>
   Five people were stabbed just inside the only entrance to a
backstage VIP area halfway through the show, and another victim was
injured by a thrown marble bench just after a large group crashed
the security checkpoint, according to Phil Casey, executive vice
president and head of urban music for International Creative
Management, which booked the tour. ``I understand that people
bum-rushed the backstage area,'' Casey said. ``They rushed right
through and then the confrontation happened.'' In a genre already
saddled with a reputation for deadly rivalries, and in the midst of
a tour that's trying to dispel some of those negative images, the
FleetCenter fracas is likely to have a far-reaching impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a major setback,'' said Glen Miller, vice president of
media relations at New York-based Double XXposure and publicist for
the Ruff Ryders/Cash Money tour. ``It's very sad that this singular
incident will probably overshadow the whole tour.''
</P>
<P>
   There had been no unusual problems on the tour, according to a
check of police reports filed in Rochester, N.Y.; Long Island;
Philadelphia; Houston; Cleveland; Baltimore; and Washington, D.C. A
return engagement at the First Union Spectrum theater in
Philadelphia scheduled for Tuesday night has been postponed
indefinitely _ a decision made by the tour producers, not the
venue, said First Union spokesman Ike Richman. The remaining nine
shows on the tour, which began on Feb. 23, will continue as
planned, according to Casey.
</P>
<P>
   Although police aren't releasing details in the ongoing
investigation, many sources say that Boston rap group Made Men _
who only recently joined the tour _ and their entourage were
involved in the altercation and may have been among the stabbing
victims. ``I think this was an aberration. Boston hasn't been
identified as a problem market,'' said Casey, whose company beefs
up the standard metal-detector and bag check with uniformed police
details and two or three checkpoints in high-risk markets like LA
and New York. ``We are strongly considering additional security
backstage and cutting out backstage guests for the rest of this
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Aberration or not, the mayhem at the FleetCenter will further
entrench hip-hop's reputation for violence. ``What we'll be dealing
with is venues not wanting shows to come in, and parents not
wanting their kids to come to the shows,'' says Casey. ``But
there's never a problem like this on the floor. The trouble takes
place when people who believe they should be backstage try to get
in backstage, or when they try to go to the hotel afterwards
looking for a party. We know where these problems are. But parents
hear there's a problem, and they aren't gonna let their kids go.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ruff Ryders/Cash Money tour is expected to be the biggest
hip-hop road show in the genre's history. So far it's been
averaging $500,000 a city, compared with $275,000 for last year's
Hard Knock Life tour, according to the concert trade publication
Pollstar. As a collaboration between two dominant labels, the tour
was also intended to undo some of the PR damage inflicted by
historic inter-label and bicoastal rivalries, which are generally
believed to be behind the murders of rappers Biggie Smalls and
Tupac Shakur.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Casey spoke to Ronald and Brian Williams, co-founders of
New Orleans-based Cash Money, at 3 a.m. Tuesday, approximately five
hours after the stabbings occurred. ``They are freaked out by
this,'' said Casey. ``They've been getting this racially mixed,
gender-mixed audience. We've all felt that we had a pretty secure
thing. There haven't been problems of this sort. The brothers are
insisting that we put it on lockdown and police detail from now
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Full refunds will be given to fans with April 3 ticket stubs at
the point of purchase; those who bought tickets over the Internet
or via phone charge will automatically have accounts credited. The
question is: Will those kids buy tickets to the next hip-hop show
that rolls through town? Or perhaps more to the point, will there
be a next hip-hop show?
</P>
<P>
   According to Casey, this won't deter the fans. ``You know why?
Because there were 5,000 people at the FleetCenter who didn't know
that anything was going on. It didn't affect the audience.'' The
future of the rap tours themselves, though, is another story. ``The
building managers have been looking for any excuse not to put these
shows into their buildings. For them, it's just another nail to
hang the hat on.'' Local promoter Don Law, who books the majority
of local music shows for national promoter SFX, would not comment.
Al Haymon, who promoted the tour nationally for SFX, did not return
calls for comment.

HIP-HOP DOESN'T DESERVE THE RAP FOR VIOLENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RENEE GRAHAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Someone somewhere is shaking their head saying, ``I told you
so.''
</P>
<P>
   With this week's headlines that at least six people were
stabbed, one critically, during a backstage fracas at the Ruff
Ryders/Cash Money tour stop at Boston's FleetCenter Monday night,
will come the inevitable bray of naysayers strenuously voicing that
no one should be surprised violence marred a hip-hop concert.
</P>
<P>
   They will point to the still-unsolved murders of Tupac and
Biggie, the mayhem-laced lyrics of many rap artists, and the
ongoing legal problems of Jay-Z and Puff Daddy _ on assault and
weapons charges, respectively _ as evidence that this is an unruly
music marinated in brutality, and that the culture it spawned has
yet again shown its true, savage self. Already Tuesday's
Philadelphia show, featuring such hot hip-hop stars as Eve, DMX and
Juvenile, was canceled, and the rest of the tour remains up in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   I, for one, hope the tour continues because anything less would
dishonor hip-hop and its legions of fans who deserve better.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake: no one should ever attend a concert, rap or
otherwise, either as a fan or performer, and leave in an ambulance
because of violence. But as unsettling as it is, it's shortsighted,
and just plain wrong to blame rap music in general, and hip-hop
culture in particular, for the troubles at Monday's FleetCenter
concert.
</P>
<P>
   Because of problems at some shows in the 1980s, rap had all but
died as a concert attraction. After several scuffles during
Run-DMC's ``Raisin' Hell'' tour in 1986, it was nearly impossible
to find venues and promoters willing to mount shows some began to
believe were inherently rife with difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Such attitudes began to thaw in 1997, when Puff Daddy, then at
the height of his powers, launched the ``No Way Out Tour,'' with,
among others, Jay-Z, Usher, Mase and Lil' Kim. Even Puff understood
that the tour wasn't just about the Benjamins. It was also a vote
on the viability of the rap concert, and an opportunity to prove
that such shows could be violence-free.
</P>
<P>
   The tour went off without a hitch and Puffy couldn't help but
trumpet what its success meant, not only to him personally, but to
the hip-hop community at large.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody hugging, touching, everybody just up against each
other, and everybody was cool with it,'' Puffy told MTV News during
a Detroit stop. ``They came to enjoy the music and that's what they
did, that's what it's all about.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the first tour to go over good,'' said DMX, ``and to
give a rap tour the credibility it needs to continue to exist.''
</P>
<P>
   With rap proving it could throw a peaceful party, 1999 saw the
even-more ambitious ``Hard Knock Life'' tour. Even though Puff &AMP;
Co.'s shows were as problem-free, this tour was again heavily
scrutinized since this was the first featuring all hardcore rap
acts with Jay-Z, DMX, Method Man and Redman.
</P>
<P>
   (It's as if every rap tour has to pass a test. Yet, I don't
recall other bands, say, the Rolling Stones, undergoing a rigorous
examination after their disastrous concert at Altamont Speedway in
1969, where a fan was stabbed to death by the Stones' hired
``security,'' the Hell's Angels.)
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, two months, 54 shows (including a stop at the
FleetCenter), and $18 million later, ``Hard Knock Life,'' left the
road as the most successful hip-hop tour ever. More important,
there was no violence.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, there were no problems on the Ruff Ryders/Cash Money
tour, which began in February, until Monday's FleetCenter show. But
hip-hop's critics, who've been forecasting its demise for 20 years,
will conveniently overlook that fact. They will also ignore the
fact that many concerts, regardless of the artists or type of
music, have been scarred by boorish behavior or violence _ from the
Who's ill-fated Cincinnati concert in 1979, where 11 fans were
crushed to death to last year's Woodstock, which degenerated into a
Bacchanalian free-for-all, although the majority of fans behaved
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Whether it's a sporting event or a concert, there always
potential for danger and disorder when large groups of people
congregate. But you could no more blame baseball for a fight in the
Fenway stands _ or an on-field dust-up among teams _ than hip-hop
should be blamed for Monday night's events.
</P>
<P>
   Hopefully, other rap tours scheduled this year, including the
hotly-awaited ``Chronic 2000,'' with Dr. Dre, Eminem, Snoop Dogg,
Warren G, and Xzibit, will not be unfairly branded. What occurred
at the FleetCenter should not be taken as a referendum future rap
tours _ nor should hip-hop and its fans be condemned for the
stupid, selfish actions of a few.

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ With deliberate moves, Nuruddin Farah took three of his
novels from a canvas bag and placed them on a podium. Then, after
donning glasses, he paused to peer at the 30 people who recently
gathered at the Barnes &AMP; Noble to hear him read.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet, respectful group was a small testament to the growing
popularity of the Somali novelist. Critics call Farah, 54, a
writer's writer, and his most ardent fans are certainly a literary
who's who: Nadine Gordimer, Chinua Achebe, Salman Rushdie. Recent
glowing reviews in The Wall Street Journal, the New York Times Book
Review, and Washington Post Book World (not to mention the
prestigious Neustadt International Prize for Literature, which he
won in 1998) are helping to spread the Farah gospel.
</P>
<P>
   His eight novels combine unique turns of phrase, political
criticism, and vividly crafted characters to deftly bring to life
the country Farah calls his obsession: Somalia. He creates a
three-dimensional world far more complex than the media's depiction
of bellicose Somalis chewing buzz-inducing khat leaves during the
US military relief mission in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Farah's candid critiques of the country's dictatorship resulted
in three attempts on his life while former president Mohamed Siad
Barre was in power. Ultimately, his tangles with Barre forced him
to live in exile, for 21 years now, in various African countries.
South Africa is his current home.
</P>
<P>
   He ``approaches subjects that most people are scared to write
about nowadays, subjects of a sexual nature and a political
nature,'' says acclaimed author Ishmael Reed, who notes that among
the literati, Farah is rumored to be the next African writer in
line for a Nobel Prize in Literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a leading African writer of great talent and
originality,'' Gordimer recently said of Farah in a written press
statement.
</P>
<P>
   On the evening of the bookstore event, Farah began by reading
from his sixth book, ``Maps.'' The novel, which tells the story of
a Somali orphan raised by an Ethiopian woman, explores territorial
issues. (Ethiopia and Somalia have been hostile neighbors for more
than a century because of border disputes.)
</P>
<P>
   ``You sit,'' Farah begins in a Somali accent tinged with British
inflections, ``in contemplative posture, your features agonized and
your expressions pained; you sit for hours and hours and hours,
sleepless, looking into darkness, hearing a small snore coming from
the room next to yours. And you conjure a past: a past in which you
see a horse drop its rider; a past in which you discern a bird
breaking out of its shell so it will fly into the heavens of
freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Hours earlier, in the bookstore's conference room, Farah talked
about the forces that brought him to this point in his career. Like
a human ocean wave, he leans in when a subject he's excited about
is broached, then relaxes back into his chair, stretching out his
ropelike arms and legs.
</P>
<P>
   A salt-and-pepper mustache and half-moon eyes add character to
Farah's face, which is the color of rich mahogany. He speaks five
languages, including Amharic (the official language of Ethiopia),
Italian, Arabic, and Somali, and chooses his words carefully, often
pausing thoughtfully before finishing sentences rife with dry wit.
</P>
<P>
   Farah started his literary career in the late 1960s, at a time
when Somalia didn't have a written language. Then fate _ in the
form of an English typewriter _ interceded.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a very practical person,'' he says wryly. ``I found an
excellent typewriter so I said, `Why not? Why not write in that
language?' ''
</P>
<P>
   It was our gain, says Richard Seaver, the publisher of Arcade
Publishing in New York, who edited Farah's last three novels.
``Nuruddin's English enriches our language because he brings to it
both an African sensibility and a gift for language that just flows
in a way I have never read in anybody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet writing in English has limited Farah's Somali audience.
Gamal Gulaid, a Somali now residing in Malden who came to hear
Farah read at Barnes &AMP; Noble, noted that Farah's audience is
usually composed of educated Somalis, Westerners, and college
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are about 5,000 Somalis in this city, and at this
reading there were less than 10 that showed up,'' Gulaid said after
the event. ``On one hand, he carries the banner for Somalia. On the
other hand, the majority of Somalis don't know about him or they
know about him but don't read him.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah often tells proverbs to illustrate a point. Ask him about
his family's reaction to his political outspokenness and he
recounts a Somali folk tale about a woman whose child refused to
speak. The mother would pray every day: ``God, God, make my son
speak.'' Finally when the child was 9, he did, saying, ``Mummy,
let's make love.'' The mother then recommenced her prayers,
``Please make him quiet!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Somalis were rather hopeful,'' Farah explains, ``that it would
be one of their sons who would become a writer, would do good,
would bring a good name to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Farah's literary output had his family begging him to be
silent for his own safety. He first crossed the government when he
wrote a play in which the only Somali character got drunk onstage.
He ran into more trouble when his first book, ``From a Crooked
Rib,'' criticized the treatment of women in his homeland, which
also isolated him from his male friends.
</P>
<P>
   He continues to take a feminist stance in his books that's
unique for male African writers. He fills his novels with strong
female characters inspired by his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``She struck me as being a great deal wiser than my father,''
says Farah. ``And yet, although people came to her privately, she
could never have opinions on matters of great importance. There was
no public function for her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember thinking to myself, `You know, it's necessary for
the privately held view of my mother to be made public. The wisdom
of women should become the property of all.' ''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Farah released his third novel, ``Sweet and Sour
Milk,'' part of a trilogy bluntly called ``Variations on the Theme
of an African Dictatorship,'' he had been sentenced to a life
outside his home country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a shock at first,'' remembers Farah of his inability to
return to Somalia under Barre's rule, which ended in 1991. Five
years later, Farah paid a visit to Somalia, which has not had a
central government since Barre was ousted.
</P>
<P>
   Farah casually mentions that during the trip, he was taken
hostage by a warlord for five days (he tends to discuss the more
dramatic aspects of his life in a blase, another-day-at-the-office
tone). The author then traveled to Mogadishu, where he absorbed the
experience of modern-day Somalia by listening to locals tell their
tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``But in a sense,'' Farah continues, ``it was also a relief. . .
. We have another Somali proverb: A hunchback must learn to live
with the discomfort of his body. You see, you can't continue
saying, `I'm a hunchback, and I don't know how to sleep.' You have
to find a way of sleeping comfortably.''
</P>
<P>
   Farah found his solution by remaining in Africa. He's lived in
Nigeria, Ethiopia, Uganda, Sudan, and Gambia. Most recently, he
settled in Cape Town, South Africa, where his wife is director of
the University of Cape Town's Gender Studies Institute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The creativity of my neuroses depends on my presence in
Africa,'' explains Farah. ``Lots of people who don't live in Africa
see Africa as a crisis point. . . . Whereas when you live in it on
a day-to-day basis, it becomes one of the narratives that are
unfolding. It doesn't shock you anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   But it does allow Farah to produce loving portraits of Somalia
in a publishing environment that, Ishmael Reed believes, expects a
less magnanimous approach when it comes to this subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very difficult for a writer like Nuruddin to not just
write about the pathologies of African culture, which is how you
get over here,'' says Reed, who met him when Farah was speaking at
the University of California at Berkeley in 1980. ``There are a
couple of major African writers who are like a road show. They go
around universities bad-mouthing Africa.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in his first work of nonfiction, ``Yesterday, Tomorrow:
Voices From the Somali Diaspora,'' Farah's goal is to clarify and
educate. The book, released in March, recounts the experiences of
Somali refugees in Africa and Europe culled from 250 interviews
Farah conducted over a seven-year period.
</P>
<P>
   This time, Farah doesn't summon up an African proverb to explain
why he embarked on this project. He uses blunt, straightforward
English.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't read anything good about the civil war in Somalia,''
says Farah, whose next work of fiction will focus on his homeland
during the period of 1990 to 1994. ``I thought I should start the
debate. . . . Even if people don't agree with my interpretation, at
least there is an interpretation made from the perspective of
knowledge. Because the majority of people who have written about
Somalia _ Americans and other foreigners _ have really no idea of
Somalia.''

<P>
   In 1935, DuBose Heyward, author of ``Porgy'' and the screenplay
of Eugene O'Neill's ``The Emperor Jones,'' wrote of a deadened
white culture vampirically sucking vitality from marginalized
blacks. Long before that, minstrel shows served blacks up as clowns
for the consumption of white audiences, while white performers
slipped into blackface to indulge in behavior deemed out of bounds
to whites. In 1958, Norman Mailer updated the situation in ``The
White Negro.'' He described would-be white hipsters latching onto
black cool, continuing the grotesque, mutually exploitative dance
of the races in America. Whites want rejuvenation and validation
from blacks. Blacks want power denied them by whites.
</P>
<P>
   If there's one American subject that comes fully loaded, it's
this still unresolved one. Today it's being danced to rap and
hip-hop. James Toback's ``Black and White,'' about upper
middle-class white kids trying to be black at precisely the moment
when their black gangsta heroes are trying to mainstream themselves
out of the ghetto, latches onto this uneasy symbiosis with an
invigorating edge before losing itself in cumbersome melodrama.
It's at its best in its semi-improvisatory confrontational dialogue
of cultural collision _ white kids exasperating their parents by
talking trash at their pricey Upper East Side dining room tables,
black guys allowing the same kids to hang around their cribs, where
the kids fantasize about belonging.
</P>
<P>
   The best thing Toback does in his best film _ flaws and all _ is
to convey the idea that nobody feels that he or she belongs.
``Black and White'' is above all a comedy of universal dislocation.
Nobody is as cool or as confident as he or she pretends to be.
Toback juggles irony and compassion deftly even when he dances on
the edge of caricature, as with Brooke Shields's dreadlocked
documentarian, following the white kids around with her camcorder,
consuming them as they consume hip-hop culture. Her flamingly gay
husband, played by Robert Downey Jr., has a brilliant scene when he
hits on Mike Tyson at a party with the predictable result.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, that Mike Tyson. He's surprisingly disarming and even sweet
in his feature debut. Tyson does a great Tyson. ``Black and White''
gives a meaty role to another pro athlete, Knicks mainstay Allen
Houston, who's both charming and affecting as a college basketball
star tempted to throw a game. You expect droll performances from
Downey and the revved-up younger actors. What you don't expect are
a handful of entertaining performances by people you don't think of
as actors _ Claudia Schiffer's treacherous girlfriend, Marla
Maples's beleaguered mom, even Toback's smarmy studio owner.
Obviously, this was an energized shoot. Still, the dominant
performance is that of Wu Tang Clan's Oli ``Power'' Grant as the
brooding producer who doesn't want to mess up his chance at real
showbiz clout.
</P>
<P>
   It can at least be said of his character that he knows what he
wants and is something more than the sum of his insecurities and
identity crises. Otherwise, the film is a mix of danger and poses.
Unfortunately, it veers away from the freshness and urgency of its
across-the-board culture clashes and into a series of increasingly
contrived melodramatic dead ends that play like outtakes from a TV
cop show. In the end, it just may be too honky-centric to cover the
ground it wants to cover. Marginalized Irish and Italians
reinvented themselves in empowering ways in America's first wave of
gangster movies in the '30s. There's no reason African-Americans
can't do the same in gangsta movies. Certainly there's a great
film, a ``Godfatha,'' to be made about gangsta culture, but I'm not
sure Toback is the one to make it. Still, ``Black and White'' is an
often dynamic film and a stretch for Toback, even if it's a case of
nice try but no exploding cigar.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Dedicated skiers and snowboarders don't have to put away their
gear just yet. Instead, they should look south for the summer. Both
New Zealand and South America offer challenging mountains and
cultural adventures.
 &HT;    In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the bowls of the
Remarkables and natural half-pipes of Treble Cone are the backdrop
for the ski town of Queenstown.
 &HT;    At the Chilean resort of Portillo, it's condors, not condos,
that predominate, along with fresh Pacific powder and views of
23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the slopes of Las Lenas and the nightlife of
Bariloche are the draws.
 &HT;    Skiing in New Zealand or South America may be an exotic
adventure, but it doesn't have to break your budget. By taking
advantage of low-season airfares, using air-and-hotel packages and
putting frequent-flier miles to work, it can be the affordable ski
trip of a lifetime. Seven-night deals for less than $2,000 _
including airfare and some meals _ are quite common.
 &HT;    Start in New Zealand, where the Southern Alps offer
above-treeline skiing, a relatively mild winter climate and easy
access to glacier- and heli-skiing. On the North Island, there's
skiing on the slopes of a live volcano, Mt. Ruapehu.
 &HT;    All of New Zealand's resorts could fit into Squaw Valley and
Alpine combined, so don't expect vast amounts of terrain. Instead,
come for the challenge and adventure of skiing down under.
 &HT;    The only drawback for New Zealand-bound skiers is time.
Considering that the direct flight takes about 11 hours from Los
Angeles and 15 from New York, nine days would seem to be the
absolute minimum stay.
 &HT;    To maximize such a skiing vacation, it's best to be based in one
location. Ideally, that's Queenstown, on the Southern Island, which
is about two-and-a-half hours by air from Auckland, via
Christchurch.
 &HT;    Often compared to Lake Tahoe, Queenstown is set on the shores of
Lake Whakatipu. This former gold-rush town is now a lively resort
of 15,000 people. Many skiers take advantage of Queenstown's
year-round bungee jumping, white-water rafting and heli-skiing,
which have earned it the title ``Terror-Tourism Capital of the
World.''
 &HT;    Within 90 minutes of Queenstown are four major resorts. Cardrona
and Coronet Peak are ideal family resorts, with terrain for skiers
of all abilities. The Remarkables appeal to advanced skiers and
snowboarders, while Treble Cone has the most challenging runs
around.
 &HT;    On the North Island, the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa are on
the slopes of the volcanic Mount Mt. Ruapehu. The best place to
stay is the resort town of Ohakune.
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise abundant snow,
challenging runs and spectacular scenery. North Americans like
skiing here because a weeklong trip is possible, jet lag is minimal
and it takes them to the heart of two of South America's most
exciting countries. An extra day for sightseeing in Buenos Aires
and Santiago can easily be added on.
 &HT;    In Argentina, Valle de Las Lenas is the first and only choice
for many North American skiers. Its vast area of lift-serviced
terrain exceeds any single North American resort. Totally above
treeline, it boasts extraordinary steeps that are reminiscent of
Verbier and Chamonix and can rattle the most accomplished expert.
There's a vigorous nightlife, including a casino, at this
stand-alone resort.
 &HT;    North Americans also go to San Carlos de Bariloche, the only
town in South America with a traditional ski culture and a jet-set
presence. Lodging is available either in the bustling,
Swiss-inspired town or at Bariloche's main ski mountain, Gran
Catedral, a few miles away.
 &HT;    It's worth making the spectacular two-hour drive north from
Bariloche to ski Chapelco, a mountain known for its advanced runs.
 &HT;    In Chile, many North American skiers head to Portillo, which is
a self-contained resort several hours from Santiago. The resorts of
Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado are closer to the capital
and comprise one of South America's largest lift-connected
complexes.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village that's located on top of the
mountain. The skiing is varied, with plenty of intermediate as well
as expert terrain.
 &HT;    Finally, about 300 miles south of Santiago is Termas de Chillan,
known for its long runs and hot springs.
 &HT;    The ski season south of the border runs from June to October,
with high season from mid-July through mid-August. Spring skiing,
which brings warmer temperatures and lower prices, begins in
mid-September.
 &HT;    A typical trip? Adventures on Skis (815 North Road, Westfield,
Mass. 01085; 800-628-9655; www.advonskis.com) sends skiers to South
America and Las Lenas, Argentina, for $1,555 per person, based on
double occupancy. That includes round-trip airfare from New York to
Buenos Aires; round-trip airfare from Buenos Aires to Malargue;
transfers; seven nights at Hotel Escorpio; daily breakfast; and
dinner.

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Dedicated skiers and snowboarders don't have to put away their
gear just yet. Instead, they should look south for the summer. Both
New Zealand and South America offer challenging mountains and
cultural adventures.
 &HT;    In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the bowls of the
Remarkables and natural half-pipes of Treble Cone are the backdrop
for the ski town of Queenstown.
 &HT;    At the Chilean resort of Portillo, it's condors, not condos,
that predominate, along with fresh Pacific powder and views of
23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the slopes of Las Lenas and the nightlife of
Bariloche are the draws.
 &HT;    Skiing in New Zealand or South America may be an exotic
adventure, but it doesn't have to break your budget. By taking
advantage of low-season airfares, using air-and-hotel packages and
putting frequent-flier miles to work, it can be the affordable ski
trip of a lifetime. Seven-night deals for less than $2,000 _
including airfare and some meals _ are quite common.
 &HT;    Start in New Zealand, where the Southern Alps offer
above-treeline skiing, a relatively mild winter climate and easy
access to glacier- and heli-skiing. On the North Island, there's
skiing on the slopes of a live volcano, Mt. Ruapehu.
 &HT;    All of New Zealand's resorts could fit into Squaw Valley and
Alpine combined, so don't expect vast amounts of terrain. Instead,
come for the challenge and adventure of skiing down under.
 &HT;    The only drawback for New Zealand-bound skiers is time.
Considering that the direct flight takes about 11 hours from Los
Angeles and 15 from New York, nine days would seem to be the
absolute minimum stay.
 &HT;    To maximize such a skiing vacation, it's best to be based in one
location. Ideally, that's Queenstown, on the Southern Island, which
is about two-and-a-half hours by air from Auckland, via
Christchurch.
 &HT;    Often compared to Lake Tahoe, Queenstown is set on the shores of

WHAT'S DOING IN LISBON

   ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by WAY TO GO! clients. Nonsubscribers can use

 &HT;    
 By MARVINE HOWE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Gradually, this sedate Old World capital has gained an exciting
new dimension along its waterfront. It's as though the center of
gravity had shifted from the city's time-worn hills back to the
great silvery Tagus River, where it all began.
 &HT;    Lisbon has become a major cruise port. The 12-mile littoral from
Belem to the ethereal two-year-old Vasco da Gama Bridge has been
spruced up and in places totally renewed. Seedy warehouses,
dilapidated tenements and abandoned factories have been
reconstituted as museums, cafes, restaurants, discos and shops or
replaced by grassy esplanades and mosaic promenades.
 &HT;    This intense renewal effort began barely a decade ago, when
Mayor Joao Soares pierced the riverside commuter train tracks with
viaducts and overpasses. First, the West Side was gentrified with
new restaurants and cultural institutions. Then the Alcantara docks
were rehabilitated as a center of night life.
 &HT;    But the major challenge was the transformation of the ugly
industrial zone on the East Side into a welcoming home for Expo 98,
and its integration as a vibrant part of the city _ a work still in
progress.
 &HT;    Lisbon expects a surge of visitors this spring, as it takes its
six-month turn as the capital of the European Union through June
30. Lisbon is also the starting point for pilgrimages to Fatima, 75
miles north, on May 12 and 13. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to
visit Fatima then in honor of the beatification of two of the three
children (the third is still living) who are said to have witnessed
the Virgin Mary there in 1917.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Spanish
playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Jordi Savall, a leading
expert on Spanish Baroque music, will conduct La Capella Reyal de
Catalunya and Hes perion XXI in excerpts from the oldest extant
Spanish opera, ``Celos aun del Aire Matan,'' by Calderon and Juan
Hidalgo. Other 17th-century songs will be part of the concert,
April 9 at 9 p.m. in the Gulbenkian Foundation's Grand Auditorium,
Avenida De Berna 45. Tickets are $16.50 to $28.50, at 210 escudos
to the dollar; telephone (351) 21-793-5131, fax (351) 21-793-7296.
 &HT;    The 250th anniversary of Bach's death will be commemorated by
the Belem Cultural Center on April 29 and 30, with performances of
more than 60 Bach concertos, orchestral suites and choral pieces.
Rene Martin and Miguel Lobo Antunes are producing the festival,
which has concerts from noon to midnight in five different halls at
the center, at Praca do Imperio. Tickets are $2.40 to $4.75 for
each concert; (351) 21-361-2400, fax (351) 21-361-2560.
 &HT;    The Belem Cultural Center is also presenting a spectacular sweep
of modern art from the Berardo Collection, including major works by
Picasso, Magritte, Miro, Pollock, Lichtenstein and Warhol. Open
daily through April 30, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission $2.85.
 &HT;    Events all year commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
discovery of Brazil by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares
Cabral. The main event features the Brazilian singers Caetano
Veloso and Maria Bethania on May 22 at 9 p.m. at the Atlantic
Pavilion in the Parque das Nacoes. Tickets, $21.50 to $57; (351)
21-891-8471, fax (351) 21-891-8413.
 &HT;    The Sao Carlos National Theater will present a new production of
Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' directed by Paulo Ferreira de Castro and
with Harry Christophers conducting. Linda Kitchen sings the role of
Pamina and Charles Workman is Tamino, June 12, 14, 16 and 20 at 8
p.m. and June 18 at 4 p.m., at the Sao Carlos Opera House, 9 Rua
Serpa Pinto. Tickets: $16.70 to $47.50; (351) 21-346-5914, fax
(351) 21-343-0613.
 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguese cuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was
widely considered to have the best food in town. When it moved to
the Expo marina, its faithful clientele followed. The new Nobre,
Edificio Nau, Marina Expo 98, (351) 21-893-1604, has kept its
standards with refined dishes like sea bass meuniere aux fines
herbes. Open daily except Sunday evening. Dinner for two with wine
is about $75.
 &HT;    Antonio Clara, also called Clube de Empresarios, 38 Avenida da
Republica, (351) 21-799-4280, is in a charming old mansion near the
bull ring. The atmosphere is elegant, with damask curtains,
silk-covered chairs, silver under-plates and an attentive staff.
French cuisine, like chateaubriand bearnaise, dominates. Dinner for
two with wine, around $65.
 &HT;    For family fare, the best bargain is Bonjardim, 11 Travessa
Santo Antao, downtown off the Avenida da Liberdade. The decor is
simple and rustic, and tasty roast chicken, salad, french fries and
an earthenware jug of wine for two runs about $10.

 By MARVINE HOWE  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Gradually, this sedate Old World capital has gained an exciting
new dimension along its waterfront. It's as though the center of
gravity had shifted from the city's time-worn hills back to the
great silvery Tagus River, where it all began.
 &HT;    Lisbon has become a major cruise port. The 12-mile littoral from
Belem to the ethereal two-year-old Vasco da Gama Bridge has been
spruced up and in places totally renewed. Seedy warehouses,
dilapidated tenements and abandoned factories have been
reconstituted as museums, cafes, restaurants, discos and shops or
replaced by grassy esplanades and mosaic promenades.
 &HT;    This intense renewal effort began barely a decade ago, when
Mayor Joao Soares pierced the riverside commuter train tracks with
viaducts and overpasses. First, the West Side was gentrified with
new restaurants and cultural institutions. Then the Alcantara docks
were rehabilitated as a center of night life.
 &HT;    But the major challenge was the transformation of the ugly
industrial zone on the East Side into a welcoming home for Expo 98,
and its integration as a vibrant part of the city _ a work still in
progress.
 &HT;    Lisbon expects a surge of visitors this spring, as it takes its
six-month turn as the capital of the European Union through June
30. Lisbon is also the starting point for pilgrimages to Fatima, 75
miles north, on May 12 and 13. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to
visit Fatima then in honor of the beatification of two of the three
children (the third is still living) who are said to have witnessed
the Virgin Mary there in 1917.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Spanish
playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Jordi Savall, a leading
expert on Spanish Baroque music, will conduct La Capella Reyal de
Catalunya and Hes perion XXI in excerpts from the oldest extant
Spanish opera, ``Celos aun del Aire Matan,'' by Calderon and Juan
Hidalgo. Other 17th-century songs will be part of the concert,
April 9 at 9 p.m. in the Gulbenkian Foundation's Grand Auditorium,
Avenida De Berna 45. Tickets are $16.50 to $28.50, at 210 escudos
to the dollar; telephone (351) 21-793-5131, fax (351) 21-793-7296.
 &HT;    The 250th anniversary of Bach's death will be commemorated by
the Belem Cultural Center on April 29 and 30, with performances of
more than 60 Bach concertos, orchestral suites and choral pieces.
Rene Martin and Miguel Lobo Antunes are producing the festival,
which has concerts from noon to midnight in five different halls at
the center, at Praca do Imperio. Tickets are $2.40 to $4.75 for
each concert; (351) 21-361-2400, fax (351) 21-361-2560.
 &HT;    The Belem Cultural Center is also presenting a spectacular sweep
of modern art from the Berardo Collection, including major works by
Picasso, Magritte, Miro, Pollock, Lichtenstein and Warhol. Open
daily through April 30, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission $2.85.
 &HT;    Events all year commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
discovery of Brazil by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares
Cabral. The main event features the Brazilian singers Caetano
Veloso and Maria Bethania on May 22 at 9 p.m. at the Atlantic
Pavilion in the Parque das Nacoes. Tickets, $21.50 to $57; (351)
21-891-8471, fax (351) 21-891-8413.
 &HT;    The Sao Carlos National Theater will present a new production of
Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' directed by Paulo Ferreira de Castro and
with Harry Christophers conducting. Linda Kitchen sings the role of
Pamina and Charles Workman is Tamino, June 12, 14, 16 and 20 at 8
p.m. and June 18 at 4 p.m., at the Sao Carlos Opera House, 9 Rua
Serpa Pinto. Tickets: $16.70 to $47.50; (351) 21-346-5914, fax
(351) 21-343-0613.
 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguesecuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was
widely considered to have the best food in town. When it moved to
the Expo marina, its faithful clientele followed. The new Nobre,
Edificio Nau, Marina Expo 98, (351) 21-893-1604, has kept its
standards with refined dishes like sea bass meuniere aux fines
herbes. Open daily except Sunday evening. Dinner for two with wine
is about $75.
 &HT;    Antonio Clara, also called Clube de Empresarios, 38 Avenida da
Republica, (351) 21-799-4280, is in a charming old mansion near the
bull ring. The atmosphere is elegant, with damask curtains,
silk-covered chairs, silver under-plates and an attentive staff.
French cuisine, like chateaubriand bearnaise, dominates. Dinner for
two with wine, around $65.
 &HT;    For family fare, the best bargain is Bonjardim, 11 Travessa
Santo Antao, downtown off the Avenida da Liberdade. The decor is
simple and rustic, and tasty roast chicken, salad, french fries and
an earthenware jug of wine for two runs about $10.

A COLORFUL TROVE IN MEXICO CITY

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By KATHERINE ASHENBURG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At the beginning it seemed pretty straightforward. I was going
to Mexico for the first time, and I didn't know enough about
Mexican history. I planned to learn more about it, and to focus a
week's stay in Mexico City, through clothes. In the costume
collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: WHERE TO LOOK, WHERE TO BUY  
 THE MUSEUMS  
 &HT;    The Franz Mayer Museum, (52-5) 518-2271, is open every day
except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $1.70.
 &HT;    The Serfin Museum, (52-5) 625-5600, is open, free of charge,
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Anthropology, (52-5) 553-6381, is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $2.75, with
no charge on Sundays.
 &HT;    Ruth Lechuga's collection of Mexican clothing and folk art,
including pottery and masks, is shown by appointment only; call or
fax (52-5) 5553-5538; the fee for a visit is $16.50.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    There are other shops selling Mexican folk clothes, both new and
old, but none that compare, in my experience, with Casa Victor, at
10 Avenida Madero, (52-5) 5512-1263, open weekdays 12:30 to 7 p.m.
The shop sells everything from 60-cent souvenirs to Huichol
paintings at $225.
 &HT;    Fonart (National Fund for Crafts) is a respected name and there
are occasional pleasant pieces, but I found its selection of
rebozos and serapes unexciting. The main store is at Avenida
Patriotismo 691, (52-5) 598-1666. The market on Balderas at Donde
not far from the Alameda, the Centro de Artesanias La Ciudadela, is
more fun but similarly unrewarding.
 &HT;    In the Bazar Sabado (Saturday Bazaar), held from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. every Saturday in Plaza San Jacinto in the charming San Angel
neighborhood, it's worth checking out Textiles de Michoacan for
good-quality, but expensive, pieces. Also, the antiques shops in
the Plaza del Angel, between Hamburgo and Londres in the Zona Rosa,
will sometimes turn up pieces of vintage clothing of fine quality.
 BOOKS  
 &HT;    ``Costumes of Mexico'' by Chloe Sayer (University of Texas
Press) is out of print, but may be available in libraries.
 &HT;    The English guide to the National Museum of Anthropology by
Ignacio Bernal is a good investment at $15.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By KATHERINE ASHENBURG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At the beginning it seemed pretty straightforward. I was going
to Mexico for the first time, and I didn't know enough about
Mexican history. I planned to learn more about it, and to focus a
week's stay in Mexico City, through clothes. In the costume
collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''

 SIDEBAR: WHERE TO LOOK, WHERE TO BUY  
 THE MUSEUMS  
 &HT;    The Franz Mayer Museum, (52-5) 518-2271, is open every day
except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $1.70.
 &HT;    The Serfin Museum, (52-5) 625-5600, is open, free of charge,
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.

 &HT;    Ruth Lechuga's collection of Mexican clothing and folk art,
including pottery and masks, is shown by appointment only; call or
fax (52-5) 5553-5538; the fee for a visit is $16.50.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    There are other shops selling Mexican folk clothes, both new and
old, but none that compare, in my experience, with Casa Victor, at
10 Avenida Madero, (52-5) 5512-1263, open weekdays 12:30 to 7 p.m.
The shop sells everything from 60-cent souvenirs to Huichol
paintings at $225.
 &HT;    Fonart (National Fund for Crafts) is a respected name and there
are occasional pleasant pieces, but I found its selection of
rebozos and serapes unexciting. The main store is at Avenida
Patriotismo 691, (52-5) 598-1666. The market on Balderas at Donde
not far from the Alameda, the Centro de Artesanias La Ciudadela, is
more fun but similarly unrewarding.
 &HT;    In the Bazar Sabado (Saturday Bazaar), held from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. every Saturday in Plaza San Jacinto in the charming San Angel
neighborhood, it's worth checking out Textiles de Michoacan for
good-quality, but expensive, pieces. Also, the antiques shops in
the Plaza del Angel, between Hamburgo and Londres in the Zona Rosa,
will sometimes turn up pieces of vintage clothing of fine quality.

 &HT;    
 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Dedicated skiers and snowboarders don't have to put away their
gear just yet. Instead, they should look south for the summer. Both
New Zealand and South America offer challenging mountains and
cultural adventures.
 &HT;    In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the bowls of the
Remarkables and natural half-pipes of Treble Cone are the backdrop
for the ski town of Queenstown.
 &HT;    At the Chilean resort of Portillo, it's condors, not condos,
that predominate, along with fresh Pacific powder and views of
23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the slopes of Las Lenas and the nightlife of
Bariloche are the draws.
 &HT;    Skiing in New Zealand or South America may be an exotic
adventure, but it doesn't have to break your budget. By taking
advantage of low-season airfares, using air-and-hotel packages and
putting frequent-flier miles to work, it can be the affordable ski
trip of a lifetime. Seven-night deals for less than $2,000 _
including airfare and some meals _ are quite common.
 &HT;    Start in New Zealand, where the Southern Alps offer
above-treeline skiing, a relatively mild winter climate and easy
access to glacier- and heli-skiing. On the North Island, there's
skiing on the slopes of a live volcano, Mt. Ruapehu.
 &HT;    All of New Zealand's resorts could fit into Squaw Valley and
Alpine combined, so don't expect vast amounts of terrain. Instead,
come for the challenge and adventure of skiing down under.
 &HT;    The only drawback for New Zealand-bound skiers is time.
Considering that the direct flight takes about 11 hours from Los
Angeles and 15 from New York, nine days would seem to be the
absolute minimum stay.
 &HT;    To maximize such a skiing vacation, it's best to be based in one
location. Ideally, that's Queenstown, on the Southern Island, which
is about two-and-a-half hours by air from Auckland, via
Christchurch.
 &HT;    Often compared to Lake Tahoe, Queenstown is set on the shores of
Lake Whakatipu. This former gold-rush town is now a lively resort
of 15,000 people. Many skiers take advantage of Queenstown's
year-round bungee jumping, white-water rafting and heli-skiing,
which have earned it the title ``Terror-Tourism Capital of the
World.''
 &HT;    Within 90 minutes of Queenstown are four major resorts. Cardrona
and Coronet Peak are ideal family resorts, with terrain for skiers
of all abilities. The Remarkables appeal to advanced skiers and
snowboarders, while Treble Cone has the most challenging runs
around.
 &HT;    On the North Island, the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa are on
the slopes of the volcanic Mount Mt. Ruapehu. The best place to
stay is the resort town of Ohakune.
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise abundant snow,
challenging runs and spectacular scenery. North Americans like
skiing here because a weeklong trip is possible, jet lag is minimal
and it takes them to the heart of two of South America's most
exciting countries. An extra day for sightseeing in Buenos Aires
and Santiago can easily be added on.
 &HT;    In Argentina, Valle de Las Lenas is the first and only choice
for many North American skiers. Its vast area of lift-serviced
terrain exceeds any single North American resort. Totally above
treeline, it boasts extraordinary steeps that are reminiscent of
Verbier and Chamonix and can rattle the most accomplished expert.
There's a vigorous nightlife, including a casino, at this
stand-alone resort.
 &HT;    North Americans also go to San Carlos de Bariloche, the only
town in South America with a traditional ski culture and a jet-set
presence. Lodging is available either in the bustling,
Swiss-inspired town or at Bariloche's main ski mountain, Gran
Catedral, a few miles away.
 &HT;    It's worth making the spectacular two-hour drive north from
Bariloche to ski Chapelco, a mountain known for its advanced runs.
 &HT;    In Chile, many North American skiers head to Portillo, which is
a self-contained resort several hours from Santiago. The resorts of
Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado are closer to the capital
and comprise one of South America's largest lift-connected
complexes.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village that's located on top of the
mountain. The skiing is varied, with plenty of intermediate as well
as expert terrain.
 &HT;    Finally, about 300 miles south of Santiago is Termas de Chillan,
known for its long runs and hot springs.
 &HT;    The ski season south of the border runs from June to October,
with high season from mid-July through mid-August. Spring skiing,
which brings warmer temperatures and lower prices, begins in
mid-September.
 &HT;    A typical trip? Adventures on Skis (815 North Road, Westfield,
Mass. 01085; 800-628-9655; www.advonskis.com) sends skiers to South
America and Las Lenas, Argentina, for $1,555 per person, based on
double occupancy. That includes round-trip airfare from New York to
Buenos Aires; round-trip airfare from Buenos Aires to Malargue;
transfers; seven nights at Hotel Escorpio; daily breakfast; and
dinner.

Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-666-4857; www.skimoguls.com); Ski

 By EVERETT POTTER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Dedicated skiers and snowboarders don't have to put away their
gear just yet. Instead, they should look south for the summer. Both
New Zealand and South America offer challenging mountains and
cultural adventures.
 &HT;    In the Southern Alps of New Zealand, the bowls of the
Remarkables and natural half-pipes of Treble Cone are the backdrop
for the ski town of Queenstown.
 &HT;    At the Chilean resort of Portillo, it's condors, not condos,
that predominate, along with fresh Pacific powder and views of
23,000-foot Cerro Aconcagua, the highest peak in the Americas.
 &HT;    In Argentina, the slopes of Las Lenas and the nightlife of
Bariloche are the draws.
 &HT;    Skiing in New Zealand or South America may be an exotic
adventure, but it doesn't have to break your budget. By taking
advantage of low-season airfares, using air-and-hotel packages and
putting frequent-flier miles to work, it can be the affordable ski
trip of a lifetime. Seven-night deals for less than $2,000 _
including airfare and some meals _ are quite common.
 &HT;    Start in New Zealand, where the Southern Alps offer
above-treeline skiing, a relatively mild winter climate and easy
access to glacier- and heli-skiing. On the North Island, there's
skiing on the slopes of a live volcano, Mt. Ruapehu.
 &HT;    All of New Zealand's resorts could fit into Squaw Valley and
Alpine combined, so don't expect vast amounts of terrain. Instead,
come for the challenge and adventure of skiing down under.
 &HT;    The only drawback for New Zealand-bound skiers is time.
Considering that the direct flight takes about 11 hours from Los
Angeles and 15 from New York, nine days would seem to be the
absolute minimum stay.
 &HT;    To maximize such a skiing vacation, it's best to be based in one
location. Ideally, that's Queenstown, on the Southern Island, which
is about two-and-a-half hours by air from Auckland, via
Christchurch.
 &HT;    Often compared to Lake Tahoe, Queenstown is set on the shores of
Lake Whakatipu. This former gold-rush town is now a lively resort
of 15,000 people. Many skiers take advantage of Queenstown's
year-round bungee jumping, white-water rafting and heli-skiing,
which have earned it the title ``Terror-Tourism Capital of the
World.''
 &HT;    Within 90 minutes of Queenstown are four major resorts. Cardrona
and Coronet Peak are ideal family resorts, with terrain for skiers
of all abilities. The Remarkables appeal to advanced skiers and
snowboarders, while Treble Cone has the most challenging runs
around.
 &HT;    On the North Island, the resorts of Whakapapa and Turoa are on
the slopes of the volcanic Mount Mt. Ruapehu. The best place to
stay is the resort town of Ohakune.
 &HT;    The resorts of Chile and Argentina promise abundant snow,
challenging runs and spectacular scenery. North Americans like
skiing here because a weeklong trip is possible, jet lag is minimal
and it takes them to the heart of two of South America's most
exciting countries. An extra day for sightseeing in Buenos Aires
and Santiago can easily be added on.
 &HT;    In Argentina, Valle de Las Lenas is the first and only choice
for many North American skiers. Its vast area of lift-serviced
terrain exceeds any single North American resort. Totally above
treeline, it boasts extraordinary steeps that are reminiscent of
Verbier and Chamonix and can rattle the most accomplished expert.
There's a vigorous nightlife, including a casino, at this
stand-alone resort.
 &HT;    North Americans also go to San Carlos de Bariloche, the only
town in South America with a traditional ski culture and a jet-set
presence. Lodging is available either in the bustling,
Swiss-inspired town or at Bariloche's main ski mountain, Gran
Catedral, a few miles away.
 &HT;    It's worth making the spectacular two-hour drive north from
Bariloche to ski Chapelco, a mountain known for its advanced runs.
 &HT;    In Chile, many North American skiers head to Portillo, which is
a self-contained resort several hours from Santiago. The resorts of
Valle Nevado, La Parva and El Colorado are closer to the capital
and comprise one of South America's largest lift-connected
complexes.
 &HT;    Valle Nevado has a village that's located on top of the
mountain. The skiing is varied, with plenty of intermediate as well
as expert terrain.
 &HT;    Finally, about 300 miles south of Santiago is Termas de Chillan,
known for its long runs and hot springs.
 &HT;    The ski season south of the border runs from June to October,
with high season from mid-July through mid-August. Spring skiing,
which brings warmer temperatures and lower prices, begins in
mid-September.
 &HT;    A typical trip? Adventures on Skis (815 North Road, Westfield,
Mass. 01085; 800-628-9655; www.advonskis.com) sends skiers to South
America and Las Lenas, Argentina, for $1,555 per person, based on
double occupancy. That includes round-trip airfare from New York to
Buenos Aires; round-trip airfare from Buenos Aires to Malargue;
transfers; seven nights at Hotel Escorpio; daily breakfast; and
dinner.
 &HT;    Or contact Moguls Ski &AMP; Snowboard Tours (4876 Sterling Drive,
Boulder, Colo. 80301; 800-666-4857; www.skimoguls.com); Ski
Vacation Planners (800-UCANSKI; www.skivacationplanners.com); or

programs in both New Zealand and South America.

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    Gradually, this sedate Old World capital has gained an exciting
new dimension along its waterfront. It's as though the center of
gravity had shifted from the city's time-worn hills back to the
great silvery Tagus River, where it all began.
 &HT;    Lisbon has become a major cruise port. The 12-mile littoral from
Belem to the ethereal two-year-old Vasco da Gama Bridge has been
spruced up and in places totally renewed. Seedy warehouses,
dilapidated tenements and abandoned factories have been
reconstituted as museums, cafes, restaurants, discos and shops or
replaced by grassy esplanades and mosaic promenades.
 &HT;    This intense renewal effort began barely a decade ago, when
Mayor Joao Soares pierced the riverside commuter train tracks with
viaducts and overpasses. First, the West Side was gentrified with
new restaurants and cultural institutions. Then the Alcantara docks
were rehabilitated as a center of night life.
 &HT;    But the major challenge was the transformation of the ugly
industrial zone on the East Side into a welcoming home for Expo 98,
and its integration as a vibrant part of the city _ a work still in
progress.
 &HT;    Lisbon expects a surge of visitors this spring, as it takes its
six-month turn as the capital of the European Union through June
30. Lisbon is also the starting point for pilgrimages to Fatima, 75
miles north, on May 12 and 13. Pope John Paul II is scheduled to
visit Fatima then in honor of the beatification of two of the three
children (the third is still living) who are said to have witnessed
the Virgin Mary there in 1917.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    To celebrate the 400th anniversary of the birth of the Spanish
playwright Pedro Calderon de la Barca, Jordi Savall, a leading
expert on Spanish Baroque music, will conduct La Capella Reyal de
Catalunya and Hes perion XXI in excerpts from the oldest extant
Spanish opera, ``Celos aun del Aire Matan,'' by Calderon and Juan
Hidalgo. Other 17th-century songs will be part of the concert,
April 9 at 9 p.m. in the Gulbenkian Foundation's Grand Auditorium,
Avenida De Berna 45. Tickets are $16.50 to $28.50, at 210 escudos
to the dollar; telephone (351) 21-793-5131, fax (351) 21-793-7296.
 &HT;    The 250th anniversary of Bach's death will be commemorated by
the Belem Cultural Center on April 29 and 30, with performances of
more than 60 Bach concertos, orchestral suites and choral pieces.
Rene Martin and Miguel Lobo Antunes are producing the festival,
which has concerts from noon to midnight in five different halls at
the center, at Praca do Imperio. Tickets are $2.40 to $4.75 for
each concert; (351) 21-361-2400, fax (351) 21-361-2560.
 &HT;    The Belem Cultural Center is also presenting a spectacular sweep
of modern art from the Berardo Collection, including major works by
Picasso, Magritte, Miro, Pollock, Lichtenstein and Warhol. Open
daily through April 30, 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. Admission $2.85.
 &HT;    Events all year commemorate the 500th anniversary of the
discovery of Brazil by the Portuguese navigator Pedro Alvares
Cabral. The main event features the Brazilian singers Caetano
Veloso and Maria Bethania on May 22 at 9 p.m. at the Atlantic
Pavilion in the Parque das Nacoes. Tickets, $21.50 to $57; (351)
21-891-8471, fax (351) 21-891-8413.
 &HT;    The Sao Carlos National Theater will present a new production of
Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' directed by Paulo Ferreira de Castro and
with Harry Christophers conducting. Linda Kitchen sings the role of
Pamina and Charles Workman is Tamino, June 12, 14, 16 and 20 at 8
p.m. and June 18 at 4 p.m., at the Sao Carlos Opera House, 9 Rua
Serpa Pinto. Tickets: $16.70 to $47.50; (351) 21-346-5914, fax
(351) 21-343-0613.
 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguese cuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was
widely considered to have the best food in town. When it moved to
the Expo marina, its faithful clientele followed. The new Nobre,
Edificio Nau, Marina Expo 98, (351) 21-893-1604, has kept its
standards with refined dishes like sea bass meuniere aux fines
herbes. Open daily except Sunday evening. Dinner for two with wine
is about $75.
 &HT;    Antonio Clara, also called Clube de Empresarios, 38 Avenida da
Republica, (351) 21-799-4280, is in a charming old mansion near the
bull ring. The atmosphere is elegant, with damask curtains,
silk-covered chairs, silver under-plates and an attentive staff.
French cuisine, like chateaubriand bearnaise, dominates. Dinner for
two with wine, around $65.
 &HT;    For family fare, the best bargain is Bonjardim, 11 Travessa
Santo Antao, downtown off the Avenida da Liberdade. The decor is
simple and rustic, and tasty roast chicken, salad, french fries and
an earthenware jug of wine for two runs about $10.

Pamina and Charles Workman is Tamino, June 12, 14, 16 and 20 at 8
p.m. and June 18 at 4 p.m., at the Sao Carlos Opera House, 9 Rua
Serpa Pinto. Tickets: $16.70 to $47.50; (351) 21-346-5914, fax
(351) 21-343-0613.
 &HT;    Every June, Lisbon celebrates its favorite saints, Anthony, John
and Peter. Festivities open with a carnivalesque parade along the
Avenida da Liberdade, June 12 at 9 p.m., followed by nightly street
music, dancing, entertainment and tasting of grilled sardines in
various neighborhoods, like Alfama and Madragoa, through June 30.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The most dazzling approach to Lisbon is by sea. The Transtejo
ferry line runs daily two-hour guided tours from the Parque das
Nacoes to Belem. They leave from Terreiro do Paco at 11 a.m. and 3
p.m. Tickets cost $14.25, and less for children.
 &HT;    Although Lisbon has Roman roots, much of the Baixa, or downtown,
was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1755. The city's main gateway
is Terreiro do Paco, a vast mosaic square framed by 18th-century
gold-colored government buildings facing the river. A triumphal
arch leads to a handsome grid of banks, offices and shops, now
largely a pedestrian area with open-air cafes.
 &HT;    The oldest neighborhoods hug the hills, with the Moorish Sao
Jorge Castle towering over the city. Inside the ramparts, an
exhibit provides a thumbnail sketch of Lisbon's history, and a
giant periscope offers spectacular views of the city and river.
Open daily 9 a.m. to 9 p.m.
 &HT;    From the castle, it's an easy stroll downhill through the old
Moorish quarter of Alfama, a maze of cobblestone alleys, stairways
and modest houses with iron balconies, flowers and fluttering
laundry. Near the base of the hill, the 12th-century Se
(cathedral), with romanesque towers and gothic chapel, is open
daily 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., except Sunday and holidays.
 &HT;    Around the corner, the new Fado and Guitar Museum at 1 Largo do
Chafariz de Dentro, gives an introduction to Lisbon's special soul
music. Open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m., except Tuesday. Admission
$2.15.
 &HT;    On the opposite hill, the Chiado, a fashionable shopping area
devastated by fire in 1988, has been restored. The centerpiece is
the Armazens do Chiado, an old department store converted into an
upscale shopping center with fabulous views.
 &HT;    The adjacent Bairro Alto used to be a working-class neighborhood
with bars and taverns, where many fado singers like Amalia
Rodrigues, who died Oct. 6, got their start. The fado houses have
been gentrified, as has much of the old neighborhood. Cafe Luso, 10
Travessa da Queimada, is in the vaulted cellars of a 17th-century
palace. An evening of dinner, folk dancing and fado costs $55 to
$70 for two. Open from 8 p.m.; (351) 21-342-2281.
 &HT;    On the western edge of the city, the monuments of Belem mark the
site from which Vasco da Gama and other navigators set out to
discover new worlds. The Tower of Belem and Jeronimos Monastery,
16th-century masterpieces, have undergone major repairs. The
Monument of the Discoveries, a stylized caravel, was built in 1960
to honor the 500th anniversary of Prince Henry the Navigator's
death.
 &HT;    The popular Coach Museum in the former Royal Riding School of
Belem Palace, Rua Belem, is closed for repairs but is expected to
reopen by early May. Admission $2.40.
 &HT;    Until Expo 98, the National Azulejo Museum, in the Madre de Deus
Monastery, 4 Rua Madre de Deus, was a cultural oasis in the
industrial zone on Lisbon's East Side. This exceptional collection
of religious and secular decorative tiles is open daily 10 a.m. to
6 p.m. except Tuesday mornings and Mondays. Admission $2.15.
 &HT;    The Parque das Nacoes, as the Expo 98 area is now called, is
open free daily 9:30 to 1 a.m., till 3 a.m. Friday and Saturday.
The Oceanarium, one of Europe's finest aquariums, is still the main
attraction. It is open daily 10 a.m. to 6 p.m.; admission $7.15,
$3.80 for children and seniors.
 &HT;    A popular addition to the parque is the Vasco da Gama shopping
center with a variety of restaurants and cafes; Sunday fairs (10
a.m. to 7 p.m.) on the northern waterfront near the restaurant area
have alternating themes: stamps and coins, then street art,
antiques and secondhand books.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Off the Avenida da Liberdade, the Lisboa Plaza, 5 Travessa
Salitre, (351) 21-346-3922, fax (351) 21-347-1630, combines modern
comforts _ double-glazed windows, air-conditioning, modem jacks _
with traditional charm, like large marble bathrooms and decorative
tiles. It has 112 rooms furnished in sunny pastels. A double is
about $128, including a copious American breakfast buffet.
 &HT;    The Orion Lisboa is a modern apartment-hotel in the former Eden
Theater, 24 Praca dos Restauradores, (351) 21-321-6600, fax (351)
21-321-6666, in the center of town. Behind the splendid Art Deco
facade, 75 studios and 59 apartments all have kitchenettes with
microwave, refrigerator and dishwasher, and air-conditioning. A
studio is $78, an apartment $93.
 &HT;    Budget: Hotel Miraparque, 12 Avenida Sidonio Pais, (351)
21-352-4286, fax (351) 21-357-8920, overlooks Parque Edward VII.
The 100 rooms have minibars, satellite television,
air-conditioning, homey flowered curtains and chenille bedspreads.
Doubles, with breakfast, are $69.
 &HT;    Luxury: The Avenida Palace, 123 Rua Primeiro Dezembro, (351)
21-346-0151, fax (351) 21-342-2884, is a grand hotel in the heart
of the city, with spacious foyer and salons, brocaded walls and
crystal chandeliers. All 82 rooms have been recently remodeled,
equipped with effective soundproofing and air-conditioning and
decorated in classic elegance. A double with breakfast is $170.
 &HT;    A favorite meeting place is Hotel Tivoli, (351) 21-319-8900, fax
(351) 21-319-8950, along the Avenida da Liberdade, with an inviting
lobby, spacious bar, terrace grill, swimming pool and tennis court
_ a rarity in Lisbon. The 329 rooms are tastefully decorated and
computer-friendly. A double including breakfast is $200.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    The latest word in riverside restaurants has no sign and an
unlikely name: O Bica do Sapato (The Shoe Tap), Avenida Infante D.
Henrique, Cais da Pedra; (351) 21-881-0320. The inspiration of
three well-known Portuguese restaurateurs who have the actor John
Malkovich as a partner, Bica combines a terrace cafeteria, upscale
restaurant and sushi bar in four renovated warehouses. The
restaurant specializes in New Portuguese cuisine (fresh and
organic), like grilled squid with artichokes. Dinner for two with
wine is about $55.
 &HT;    A Travessa, 28 Travessa das Inglesinhas, (351) 21-390-2034, with
red-tile floors, whitewashed walls and local art, is near
Parliament and will open a new establishment on Terreiro do Paco,
by the river, in summer. Specialties include bacon-wrapped dates
and grilled turbot encrusted in salt to preserve the juices. Dinner
for two with a good wine: $55.
 &HT;    When it was across from the Presidential Palace, Nobre was
widely considered to have the best food in town. When it moved to
the Expo marina, its faithful clientele followed. The new Nobre,
Edificio Nau, Marina Expo 98, (351) 21-893-1604, has kept its
standards with refined dishes like sea bass meuniere aux fines
herbes. Open daily except Sunday evening. Dinner for two with wine
is about $75.
 &HT;    Antonio Clara, also called Clube de Empresarios, 38 Avenida da
Republica, (351) 21-799-4280, is in a charming old mansion near the
bull ring. The atmosphere is elegant, with damask curtains,
silk-covered chairs, silver under-plates and an attentive staff.
French cuisine, like chateaubriand bearnaise, dominates. Dinner for
two with wine, around $65.
 &HT;    For family fare, the best bargain is Bonjardim, 11 Travessa
Santo Antao, downtown off the Avenida da Liberdade. The decor is
simple and rustic, and tasty roast chicken, salad, french fries and
an earthenware jug of wine for two runs about $10.

 (PLEASE NOTE: This article has been transmitted twice _ into the
``t'' travel news and ``l'' lifestyle news files.)  
 &HT;    
 By KATHERINE ASHENBURG  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) 
 &HT;    At the beginning it seemed pretty straightforward. I was going
to Mexico for the first time, and I didn't know enough about
Mexican history. I planned to learn more about it, and to focus a
week's stay in Mexico City, through clothes. In the costume
collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''
 &HT;    -----
 SIDEBAR: WHERE TO LOOK, WHERE TO BUY  
 THE MUSEUMS  
 &HT;    The Franz Mayer Museum, (52-5) 518-2271, is open every day
except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $1.70.
 &HT;    The Serfin Museum, (52-5) 625-5600, is open, free of charge,
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Anthropology, (52-5) 553-6381, is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $2.75, with
no charge on Sundays.
 &HT;    Ruth Lechuga's collection of Mexican clothing and folk art,
including pottery and masks, is shown by appointment only; call or
fax (52-5) 5553-5538; the fee for a visit is $16.50.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    There are other shops selling Mexican folk clothes, both new and
old, but none that compare, in my experience, with Casa Victor, at
10 Avenida Madero, (52-5) 5512-1263, open weekdays 12:30 to 7 p.m.
The shop sells everything from 60-cent souvenirs to Huichol
paintings at $225.
 &HT;    Fonart (National Fund for Crafts) is a respected name and there
are occasional pleasant pieces, but I found its selection of
rebozos and serapes unexciting. The main store is at Avenida
Patriotismo 691, (52-5) 598-1666. The market on Balderas at Donde
not far from the Alameda, the Centro de Artesanias La Ciudadela, is
more fun but similarly unrewarding.
 &HT;    In the Bazar Sabado (Saturday Bazaar), held from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. every Saturday in Plaza San Jacinto in the charming San Angel
neighborhood, it's worth checking out Textiles de Michoacan for
good-quality, but expensive, pieces. Also, the antiques shops in
the Plaza del Angel, between Hamburgo and Londres in the Zona Rosa,
will sometimes turn up pieces of vintage clothing of fine quality.
 BOOKS  
 &HT;    ``Costumes of Mexico'' by Chloe Sayer (University of Texas
Press) is out of print, but may be available in libraries.
 &HT;    The English guide to the National Museum of Anthropology by
Ignacio Bernal is a good investment at $15.

collections of the city's museums and, I hoped, in its shops and
markets, I would begin to understand the country's numerous
revolutions, the relationship between the Indians and Spanish
conquerors, even something about the depths of the Mexican soul.
 &HT;    Those ignorant of the seriousness of costume history might
dismiss this as the project of an optimist, even an airhead. Wiser
minds know better. Think of the significance of cotton in
determining the Civil War, of the flapper's dress in signaling a
sexual revolution. Undeniably, clothing is a window onto large
events as well as intangibles like culture.
 &HT;    By and large, my plan was a success. But, as often happens in
unsystematic enterprises, things didn't quite proceed in the
correct order.
 &HT;    My quest began with two books, the name of a shop and the name
of a woman. The books were the Lonely Planet guide to Mexico City
and Chloe Sayer's magisterial history, ``Costumes of Mexico.'' The
shop was Casa Victor, a hideaway selling some of the best of
Mexico's folk arts. The woman's name was Ruth Lechuga. A friend in
Toronto told me that she had a large private collection of folk
arts, which she showed to interested visitors.
 &HT;    But first I wanted to familiarize myself with a few museum
collections. The National Museum of Anthropology would no doubt
have extensive holdings of clothes from Mexico's 50-some Indian
cultures, but it sounded daunting. Looking for a more manageable
start, I scanned Lonely Planet and discovered the Franz Mayer
Museum (Avenida Hidalgo 45, at the north end of the city's downtown
park, the Alameda), a small, choice collection of the applied arts.
Its holdings include antique rebozos (women's rectangular shawls
that double as a carryall) and serapes (the blanket that frequently
includes an opening for the head). I'm off.
 &HT;    It's my first mistake. Which doesn't mean that the Franz Mayer
isn't eminently visitable. The colonial ceramics, silver and
furniture are splendid, its home in a 16th-century hospital has
been sensitively restored, and the cafe in the crisply formal
cloister garden is one of the nicest places to eat in Mexico City.
Its rebozos and serapes are also very fine, but they belong at the
end of the week, not the beginning.
 &HT;    Just inside the Franz Mayer's textile rooms, cases display the
natural dyes, materials and techniques that go into Mexican
clothes. Unfortunately, I don't read Spanish. Using my French, the
tattered remnants of my Latin and the exhibits themselves, I begin
to acquire some essential vocabulary _ lana (wool), lino (linen),
seda (silk) and algodon (cotton). Indigo is easy. Bordado means
embroidery; aplicacion is applique. It's a start, but meanwhile I'm
missing about 90 percent of the information.
 &HT;    Even Spanish signs, I realize when I enter the main textile
room, are better than no signs. This softly lighted gallery has
cases of superb objects, with no indication of their provenance or
age. At least I've read enough Chloe Sayer to recognize a rebozo,
perhaps the quintessential colonial Mexican garment, and one in
particular intrigues me.
 &HT;    Three long panels of beige silk, connected by bands of guilloche
work (a braided effect), are embroidered with houses, fountains,
cornucopias and very European-looking ladies and gentlemen. Judging
by the ladies' and gentlemen's clothes, it dates from the 18th
century and is an extraordinarily delicate example of a style worn
by all social classes.
 &HT;    Less sumptuous but still handsome, nine rebozos _ somberly
striped in blue, brown and red _ occupy a nearby case. At this
point, I don't even know how they are made (on an Indian backstrap
loom, using a complex method of tie-dyeing called ikat).
 &HT;    A group of embroidery samplers charms me; later I learn that
these were the means by which Mexican pupils learned Spanish
stitches during the colonial period (1521-1821).
 &HT;    I leave the Franz Mayer discouraged but unbowed, hoping for a
more user-friendly museum. The Serfin Museum (Avenida Madero 33)
has a collection of more than 5,000 pieces of Indian costumes. One
big workaday room, the museum proper displays perhaps 20 life-size
models dressed in the clothes of a particular region, with other
examples hung on the walls.
 &HT;    At first the Serfin, too, looks like a challenge _ signs only in
Spanish, the current exhibition limited to the dress of the
Zapotecs in Oaxaca.
 &HT;    Don't panic, I tell myself, enjoy the details, the lace, the
almost-African combinations of yellow and red, the bold woolen
flowers blooming on black velvet festival dresses. Along the way
(my Spanish is improving rapidly), I learn something about the
huipil, the indigenous woman's tunic in use for the last 2,000
years. Sleeveless, often but not always sewn up the sides, the
Zapotecs' huipil is typically an immaculate white, minimally
embroidered or decorated with white-on-white woven effects.
 &HT;    Examples of another pre-Hispanic dress, a short-sleeved square
blouse with sash and wraparound skirt, are seen here in brilliant
reds and rich browns. Like the huipil and Indian clothing in
general, they are composed entirely of rectangular pieces, because
that's what the backstrap loom produces.
 &HT;    More familiar to Americans than the huipil is the short-sleeved
white blouse whose yoke and sleeves are embroidered with flowers.
The embroidery here, on blouses from Ocotlan, is far more
painstaking than anything I have seen made for the tourist market.
Minuscule, beautifully worked pink and red flowers, with the
occasional yellow accent, cover the yoke of one blouse.
 &HT;    Just up the street from the Serfin is Casa Victor (Avenida
Madero 10), the shop I had heard about from a Mexican friend in
Toronto. The office building is nondescript, and there is no sign.
 &HT;    Dubious, I climb two heart-thumping flights of stairs to No. 305
(don't smile, until you've done stairs at Mexico City's altitude)
and find a treasure trove of Mexican crafts. Chosen with
discernment and affection from all over the country, they include
silver, tinware and ceramics, but I head for the tables neatly
piled with clothes in the center of the room.
 &HT;    Perhaps because it is a shop, where I can touch the fabrics;
perhaps because I have accepted the haphazard nature of my quest, I
relax. I pore over a Huichol cotton smock, densely embroidered with
geometric motifs, stars and deer that, in their red-and-blue
precision, could be mistaken for Nordic. At $390, calculated at 9
pesos to the dollar, it is not inexpensive, but its verve is so
distinctive I could imagine displaying it on a wall.
 &HT;    Cotton shirts can be had at Casa Victor for as little as $12;
rebozos striped in the traditional flamelike designs cost from $83
to about $133. But what wins my heart is a spectacular fiesta skirt
from Puebla, its red wool thickly strewn with sequined butterflies
and black ``lace.'' (The lace is actually drawn on, then outlined
in sequins.)
 &HT;    The whole outrageously glamorous piece ends in a green satin
border and costs $89. The saleswoman murmurs, ``china poblana''
when she sees me admiring it. That night I learn from ``Costumes of
Mexico'' that a china poblana is a showy 19th-century belle of
mixed European and Indian blood; flashy clothes in that style are
called china poblana by extension. I return to Casa Victor twice
during the week, at least partly to visit that skirt.
 &HT;    By midweek I feel ready to tackle the vast National Museum of
Anthropology in Chapultepec Park, with its 10 second-floor halls
devoted to the Indians of contemporary Mexico. They demand the best
part of the day, and the English signs range from nonexistent to
excellent, but the reward is that the clothes are shown in the
context of a culture.
 &HT;    The Totonacs on the Gulf Coast, for example, are vanilla growers
whose women are noted for their textiles. The short chairs on which
they spin and weave cotton are part of the exhibit, as are displays
of their fishing gear, their home altars, and costumed mannequins
demonstrating their elaborate dances.
 &HT;    A typically gauzy Totonac quechquemitl (the pre-conquest woman's
poncho) on display is decorated twice, with a sure eye for design _
first with fine white thread on the loosely woven cotton, then
over-embroidered with brilliant birds and flowers.
 &HT;    The model of a Totonac wedding couple is particularly
interesting for the groom's attire, since traditional male clothing
has become increasingly rare as men join the modern work force.
This groom wears a bright white pair of the short, loose pants
called calzon; a short flared shirt that barely meets his pants and
two neckerchiefs, one white, one yellow.
 &HT;    In the Maya highlands of Chiapas, Spanish missionaries imposed
variations on the Indians' clothing according to their village, as
a method of keeping tabs on their comings and goings. A market
scene in the Maya hall shows 16 figures, each from a different
village, in the particular, vivid dress peculiar to that village.
 &HT;    No amount of orders from without seems to have diminished the
Indians' graphic sense, as a case of dramatic huipils in the same
hall illustrates. One stunningly designed piece has warm brown
diamond-shaped motifs on the shoulders and breast, lighter ones
below and then, on the white skirt, a single, memorable line of
brown thread running vertically to the hem.
 &HT;    I have reserved my last day to visit Ruth Lechuga, whom I found
in the Mexico City phone book. Yes, she would show me her
collection.
 &HT;    When I ring the bell at her building in the quiet Condesa
quarter, a white head appears on the third floor and tosses me the
key. Although I know that Lechuga, who arrived in Mexico in 1939 as
a teenage Jewish refugee from Vienna, is one of the foremost
authorities on Mexican folk arts and that her apartment is a
private museum (nothing is for sale), I'm unprepared for the wonder
of it.
 &HT;    Eighteen rooms (two old-fashioned, roomy apartments have been
combined) full of smartly displayed, meticulously cataloged masks,
toys, pottery, gourds, paintings, furniture and textiles are
presided over by their diminutive collector. She began driving to
remote parts of Mexico in the 1940s, buying what appealed to her in
the markets. At 80, she is still interested in acquiring an example
of something she doesn't have _ but that doesn't often happen.
 &HT;    After a general tour of the collection, including her
shocking-pink bedroom decorated with Day of the Dead papier-mache
skulls, we sit down together. I have told her I'm interested in
clothes, and she has chosen a representative selection of rebozos,
huipils, serapes, quechquemitls, sashes, wraparound skirts.
 &HT;    For more than an hour, in what amounts to a private tutorial,
she shows me what to look for in a rebozo; what is special about a
particular brocaded yoke on a huipil; why a child's cap comes in
bright colors (to distract the evil eye so it doesn't land on the
child); how the Indians blend synthetic and natural materials, hand
and machine embroidery, modern and traditional motifs; how they use
smocking as a way to tailor their rectangular pieces of cloth; how
they take a secretion from a particular shellfish (without killing
it) to produce a subtle amethyst color.
 &HT;    It strikes me as a heady, rare privilege, but ``this is how I
earn my living,'' she tells me. The cost for a tour is $16.50.
 &HT;    Clearly, I've done everything backward. I should have begun with
Ruth Lechuga, gone on to the Museum of Anthropology, then the
Serfin Museum and ended in that connoisseur's haven, the Franz
Mayer, savoring those silent cases with more appreciation. The only
things I've done ``correctly'' were reading ''Costumes of Mexico''
and visiting Casa Victor three times.
 &HT;    But I don't really regret my herky-jerky progress. I'm
significantly less ignorant about Mexico than I was a week ago.
I've also spent absorbed, delightful hours peering at blouses
crowded with blossoms, hand-knotted fringe and fine weaving. One of
the gnomic sayings I remember from Kurt Vonnegut's ``Cat's Cradle''
is ``Peculiar travel suggestions are dancing lessons from God.'' In
my case, amend that to ``embroidery lessons.''

 SIDEBAR: WHERE TO LOOK, WHERE TO BUY  
 THE MUSEUMS  
 &HT;    The Franz Mayer Museum, (52-5) 518-2271, is open every day
except Monday, from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $1.70.
 &HT;    The Serfin Museum, (52-5) 625-5600, is open, free of charge,
Tuesday through Sunday, 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
 &HT;    The National Museum of Anthropology, (52-5) 553-6381, is open
Tuesday through Sunday, 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. Admission is $2.75, with
no charge on Sundays.
 &HT;    Ruth Lechuga's collection of Mexican clothing and folk art,
including pottery and masks, is shown by appointment only; call or
fax (52-5) 5553-5538; the fee for a visit is $16.50.
 SHOPPING  
 &HT;    There are other shops selling Mexican folk clothes, both new and
old, but none that compare, in my experience, with Casa Victor, at
10 Avenida Madero, (52-5) 5512-1263, open weekdays 12:30 to 7 p.m.
The shop sells everything from 60-cent souvenirs to Huichol
paintings at $225.
 &HT;    Fonart (National Fund for Crafts) is a respected name and there
are occasional pleasant pieces, but I found its selection of
rebozos and serapes unexciting. The main store is at Avenida
Patriotismo 691, (52-5) 598-1666. The market on Balderas at Donde
not far from the Alameda, the Centro de Artesanias La Ciudadela, is
more fun but similarly unrewarding.
 &HT;    In the Bazar Sabado (Saturday Bazaar), held from 10 a.m. to 7
p.m. every Saturday in Plaza San Jacinto in the charming San Angel
neighborhood, it's worth checking out Textiles de Michoacan for
good-quality, but expensive, pieces. Also, the antiques shops in
the Plaza del Angel, between Hamburgo and Londres in the Zona Rosa,
will sometimes turn up pieces of vintage clothing of fine quality.
 BOOKS  
 &HT;    ``Costumes of Mexico'' by Chloe Sayer (University of Texas
Press) is out of print, but may be available in libraries.
 &HT;    The English guide to the National Museum of Anthropology by
Ignacio Bernal is a good investment at $15.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Asparagus are native to the eastern Mediterranean. They were
cultivated by the ancient Greeks despite warnings from a 4th
century B.C. writer who said they caused blindness.
</P>
<P>
   You can understand why the warnings were ignored. Asparagus are
so delicious, so filled with the flavors of spring. Everyone says
that wild asparagus are far superior to the cultivated variety.
Since most of us aren't likely to find them it's hardly a hardship
to have to eat those that we find in the store.
</P>
<P>
   But you will find the best flavor if you wait until asparagus
are in season, and the closer they are to where you live the better
they are likely to taste. Asparagus start to lose both flavor and
texture the moment they are picked. One way you can improve on them
is to break off the tough part of the stalk and sit the rest of the
asparagus in sugared water for 30 minutes. Prime season is March to
May.
</P>
<P>
   If you are serving asparagus with a dressing that contains lemon
or vinegar do not sauce them until just before serving because the
acid will turn the asparagus a yellowish to grayish green.
</P>
<P>
   ASPARAGUS AND CHEESE SALAD
</P>
<P>
   The only way this recipe works is if the spears are sliced
paper-thin. If you are very good with a knife you can do this.
Otherwise, use a mandoline if you have one. You can also cut them
on the thinnest slicing blade of a food processor.
</P>
<P>
   12 asparagus spears
</P>
<P>
   4 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   A few shakes salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 ounces Parmigiano Reggiano (heaping 7 tablespoons)
</P>
<P>
   1. Snap the tough end of the asparagus from the tender at the
point where it breaks naturally. Wash the asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   2. Cut the asparagus tips from the stalk and cut lengthwise in
halves. Slice the stalks on the diagonal as thin as possible.
</P>
<P>
   3. Arrange the asparagus on a serving plate; season with salt
and pepper and drizzle with oil.
</P>
<P>
   4. Using a vegetable peeler scrape the cheese right over the
asparagus to cover.

<P>
   ROASTED ASPARAGUS
</P>
<P>
   Roasting changes the flavor of asparagus from green and
springlike to rich, earthy and concentrated.
</P>
<P>
   1 pound asparagus
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Few shakes salt, optional
</P>
<P>
   1 lemon, optional
</P>
<P>
   1. Place the oven rack in the top third of the oven and preheat
the oven to 450 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   2. Break the tough ends from the asparagus at the point where
they meet the tender part and break easily. Wash asparagus, place
on jelly roll pan and drizzle with oil. Season with salt, if
desired. Roll the asparagus to coat them with the oil.
</P>
<P>
   3. Roast for about 5 minutes; shake the pan to prevent sticking.
Continue roasting, another 2 to 5 minutes. When the asparagus
soften and begin to brown here and there _ 7 to 10 minutes _ they
are done.
</P>
<P>
   4. Serve with lemon wedges if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 2 servings.
</P>
<P>
   Note: I think they have their truest flavor without the salt and
with just a squeeze of lemon juice.
</P>
<P>
   You can also steam the asparagus and follow the directions in
the recipe above. Heat the oven to 475; roll asparagus in oil,
eliminate the salt and sprinkle with 2 tablespoons of grated
Parmigiano Reggiano. Roast for 5 minutes without turning or shaking
the pan.

   RISOTTO WITH ASPARAGUS AND PROSCIUTTO
</P>
<P>
   4 cups no-salt-added vegetable or chicken stock
</P>
<P>
   2 large shallots
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 pound asparagus
</P>
<P>
   1 cup arborio rice
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces Parmigiano Reggiano (1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons
coarsely grated)
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground black pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 ounces prosciutto
</P>
<P>
   1. In a saucepan, heat the stock to a simmer.
</P>
<P>
   2. Chop the shallots. Heat the oil in a deep, heavy-bottomed
pot; add the shallots and saute until they take on a little color.
</P>
<P>
   3. Wash the asparagus.
</P>
<P>
   5. Add the rice to the shallots; stir well to coat.
</P>
<P>
   6. Add the wine to the rice, stir, and let the wine cook away,
about 2 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   7. Snap the tough stem ends of the asparagus, breaking them at
the point where the woody part meets the tender part. Cut the
spears just below the tips and cut the rest of the stems into 1/2
inch pieces.
</P>
<P>
   8. Add about a cup of simmering stock to the rice and cook over
medium high heat, stirring frequently until the liquid has been
absorbed. Repeat this procedure, adding more stock as it is
absorbed into the rice while stirring often.
</P>
<P>
   9. Grate the cheese and cut the prosciutto into small pieces.
</P>
<P>
   10. Five minutes before the rice is cooked, stir the asparagus
into the rice. When the rice is tender but before all the stock has
been absorbed _ the mixture should be slightly runny _ remove from
the heat. Season with pepper and stir in the cheese and the
prosciutto.

   Most companies have discovered that the dynamics of the Internet
are different from those of the traditional business environment.
But many have not realized just how different they are, and how
much change may be involved in blending them.
</P>
<P>
   The collision and integration of the traditional and online
worlds create a new dynamic of contrary expectations. In this new
world, things are not as they appear, and they're certainly not an
extension of the past. In fact, they often are exactly the opposite
of what one would expect.
</P>
<P>
   I call this impact of the Net ``the 180-degree effect.''
</P>
<P>
   The most famous early example was Netscape's giving away its
browser, which was then its key product. That challenged the
assumption that the core product should be what people pay for. It
stood the notion of ``value'' on its head. Value was no longer
measured by revenue from base product, but by market share and
speed of product introduction.
</P>
<P>
   What does the 180-degree effect look like in the Net Future?
</P>
<P>
   -- Customers are charged less for delivery of several pounds of
groceries ordered online than for an ounce of paper delivered
overnight by the same delivery company.
</P>
<P>
   -- Real-time stock quotes, formerly a core asset for Wall Street
brokers, become available to all through the Net.
</P>
<P>
   -- America Online not long ago paid content providers to supply
information to its network. Now it's the other way around. Content
providers offer hefty fees to be featured on AOL. The company even
became the acquirer of Time Warner.
</P>
<P>
   -- Customers used to simply buy the product. Now, in true
180-degree fashion, customers are providing the product.
Amazon.com, which began by supplying a large inventory to its
customers, is now letting customers supply the inventory. Anyone
can list an item for sale in Amazon's zSHOPS; the seller is
responsible for shipping. And like eBay and other sites, Amazon.com
runs online auctions.
</P>
<P>
   With so many opportunities, many companies have to decide which
businesses they are not in, rather than which businesses to pursue.
</P>
<P>
   The 180-degree effect will increasingly affect how companies
need to develop their approach to E-Business and how to blend their
traditional and online operations.
</P>
<P>
   How should a company use the 180-degree effect to advantage?
First, by starting to think that way. When looking at how to move
its business into the Net environment, a company should think about
what it would do in a ``normal'' world. What would the business
plan look like? Put all the elements on paper -- every assumption
and every projection, five years out.
</P>
<P>
   Then -- and this is the hard part -- challenge every single
assumption. What if the entire pricing strategy were exactly
reversed? What if a competitor was not one of the company's
traditional competitors, but from a different industry altogether?
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate question that arises from this change involves the
entire value chain of the company. When considering the impact of
the Net, a true E-Business thinks about product conception,
manufacturing, distribution and consumption. But it also needs to
think about what would happen if that entire chain were subject to
the 180-degree effect. What if the process were flipped end-to-end,
so that the value chain is driven by the customer rather than by
the company?
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the consumer truly being in charge of the
process, using mechanisms such as real-time feedback and enhanced
information distribution, is probably one of the most powerful
business notions brought about by the Netting of the world. It
involves much more than lip service or a mission statement with
platitudes about ``the customer coming first.'' It requires both
action and attitude to take a hard look at whether some fairly
dramatic changes are needed to stay competitive.
</P>
<P>
   For some companies, that, too, may feel like a 180-degree
effect.

&HT;     WHAT'S `BLACK AND WHITE' AND DULL ALL OVER? 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By WESLEY MORRIS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tag line for ``Black and White,'' James Toback's
improvisatory investigation of hip-hop culture and the white kids
who've embraced it, asks: ``What happens when you mix it up?''
</P>
<P>
   You should answer, ``Ideological disaster!'' Then wave your
hands in the air, wave 'em like you just don't care. It's that kind
of experiment.
</P>
<P>
   As hip-hop has become what rock critic Tour defensively dubbed
``its own nation,'' the problems of such a self-governing body _
foreigners working without visas, urban sprawl, pollution, a budget
surplus _ only beget more problems.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-age poseurs from the Upper West Side of New York aren't
thorns in hip-hop's side, they're its insane clown posse. And for
its first 15 minutes, ``Black and White'' gets off on telling that
joke: rich white kids (none more thrilling in her obnoxiousness
than Bijou Phillips' Charlie) eliding their wealthy backgrounds as
a means of rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Toback seems to grasp the race-trading going on among a pack of
kids literally horny for hip-hop: Philips' performance begins as a
whiny grotesque _ she's a toddler with gold caps and bamboo
earrings who calls the place you go to borrow books a ``lybaree.''
She's late for dinner because she and a girlfriend were out
trysting in the woods with thug-turning-rap producer Rich (Wu-Tang
Clan's Oli ``Power'' Grant) and rapper Cigar (Wu's Corey
``Raekwon'' Woods). We know where she's been, and her B-girl
ecstasy manifests itself as hip-hop potty mouth that sends welfare
chills down her mother Muffy's (Marla Maples) spine. It's a funny,
if utterly rote subversion of upper-echelon staidness that's like
beating a long-empty piata.
</P>
<P>
   It also telegraphs the pseudosensationalism to follow. Toback is
on a serious Altman bender here. In a matter of minutes, the
``Black and White'' ensemble swells from one girl and her friends
(seemingly cuckoo for Cocoa Puff Daddies) into an abominably
distilled opera cum traffic jam about racial and pop essentialism
that in its shortcomings feels desperately snoopy.
</P>
<P>
   Brooke Shields materializes in dreadlocks as Sam Donager, a
documentary filmmaker who wants to make a video documentary about
Charlie and her friends _ the rest of whom are played by Gaby
Hoffman, Eddie Kaye Thomas and Elijah Wood, three actors who are
trying to stretch their caricatures into a realm of three
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   The kids explain their lifestyle to Sam and her gay husband
(played by Robert Downey Jr., doing a swishier, creepier remix of
his ``Wonder Boys'' slattern). If ``Black and White'' seems facile
and inconclusive wading in this end of the pool, it's downright
retarded as it skates on the patina of black male virility and
racism. There's a story line involving Dean, a college hoops star
(New York Knicks point guard Allan Houston) who's duped into
accepting money from a fallen cop (Ben Stiller) looking for
redemption. He uses Dean to get to Rich. And somewhere in all this
is Claudia Schiffer as Dean's manipulative grad-student girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   As he demonstrated with the similarly improv-derived ``Two Girls
and Guy,'' Toback is an actor's director only insofar as he carves
out spaces for improvisation. But Downey, who's been blazingly
self-aware in two previous outings with Toback, is the one actor
who knows what to do within them.
</P>
<P>
   Much of what Toback appears to be doing involves laying out
texts like Albert Murray's ``The Omni-Americans,'' Norman Mailer's
``The White Negro,'' and Robert Downey Sr.'s film, ``Putney
Swope,'' enacting and bottling aspects of them, but to no avail.
He's building a dialectic between two worlds in which synthesis is
the result of access, not the exchange of actual feeling or ideas.
But the director seems more interested in ironic juxtapositions:
Maples in a hip-hop club, Schiffer making out with a founding
father of the Wu-Tang Clan, inter alia.
</P>
<P>
   The film's exclusive focus on white kids imbued with the souls
of black folk leaves you wondering about the more intriguing
preponderance of Asian and Hispanic kids under the same influence.
(FYI: Black women, here, are relegated to being naked bodies in a
player scenario.)
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, the best caricature is Mike Tyson. The boxer plays
himself and is written and performed as some sort of Shakespearean
survivor. He gives sage, if lilting, advice. He seems deep,
complicated, preoccupied, but with what? His own loneliness? The
Shakespearean dimensions of his own life?
</P>
<P>
   There's not a single thing about this movie as hypnotic or
profound as he. And in his willed solitude he's independent and
questioning in a movie that moans like a trust-fund baby.
</P>

&HT;     ADVISERS SAY TOPSY-TURVY MARKET WARRANTS LONT-TERM APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By VICTORIA COLLIVER and ALAN T. SARACEVIC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The advice from financial advisers in the midst
of market volatility is like a mantra: Stick to a long-term,
diversified investment plan, and don't do anything rash.
</P>
<P>
   ``You shouldn't have all your money in dot-com, small-cap tech
stocks,'' said Scott Lummer, chief investment officer for mPower,
an on-line investment advising firm in San Francisco. ``If there a
lesson to be learned from the last three months it's
diversification.''
</P>
<P>
   While investment advisers and brokers say that topsy-turvy days
like Tuesday, when the leading indexes experienced a frenetic
trading range, few seem to be panicking.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Deely, vice president and branch manager for Fidelity
Investment's San Francisco center, said most customers who went
into the office Tuesday were making contributions to their
retirement plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``They know that it's the long-term, not the short-term. The
majority were not concerned with what's happening today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lummer said that while this is not a good time to sell, it could
be a great time to get into the market. People who are feeling
nervous, he said, are likely too heavily invested in the tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
   While the Web will continue to be a big part of the economy, he
said ``old economy'' stocks that seem fuddy-duddy compared to
technology stocks remain the driving forces of the current economy
_ companies such as the automotive makers and utilities.
</P>
<P>
   Such companies don't have the same cachet as trendy Internet
stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of showboat investing,'' Lummer said. ``You
don't showboat by buying Chase Manhattan Bank. That's so 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   Harris Fricker, president and chief executive of Whatifi.com, a
financial investment site that will soon be launched in San
Francisco, suggests such matters be left to the professionals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big secret to financial investing is there is no secret,''
he said. ``The best bet is to buy the entire market, and I don't
mean just stocks. I'm talking index funds that give you broad
exposure to stocks, bonds and cash. Hold it long, don't sell.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let someone else worry about the next hot stock,'' Fricker
said. ``You already have a job. You don't need another one,
worrying about your stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Dale W. Schultz, principal at Schultz Collins Lawson Chambers
Inc. in San Francisco, suspects the growing number of individual
traders are responsible for some of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``This market volatility begs a few questions: To what extent
are individuals responsible for the daily volatility?'' he said.
``Five years ago, the number of individuals participating directly
in the market on a daily basis was only a fraction of what it is
today.''
</P>
<P>
   He repeated the mantra: ``Stay with your long-term investment
policy. Avoid acting on short-term market exigencies.''

PARLIAMENT APPROVES YOSHIRO MORI AS JAPAN'S NEW PRIME MINISTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
(See also JAPAN-MORI-PROFILE) 
(js) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Closing out a period of unusually intense, if
scrupulously shrouded political jockeying, Japan's parliament
Wednesday elected a new prime minister to replace Keizo Obuchi, who
was left in a coma by a stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's successor, Yoshiro Mori, was nominated by the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party after a party meeting Wednesday morning.
His candidacy was quickly put to a vote before the two houses of
the Japanese parliament, or Diet, where he was overwhelmingly
approved.
</P>
<P>
   The vote capped an extraordinary morning of abruptly shifting
emotions in Japanese politics, where the teary remembrances of
Obuchi made by the leader of the caretaker government the night
before gave way to Mori's selection in an almost lusty acclamation
by the Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers, and then to his
confirmation by an overwhelming vote in the Diet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to pursue Obuchi's economic revitalization
policies and make every effort to restore the economy to stable
growth,'' said Mori, a burly former rugby player and debating team
colleague of Obuchi's from their days together at Tokyo's
prestigious Waseda University. Both men are 62 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy ratification of the Liberal Democratic Party's choice
put to rest concerns about a power vacuum, which were voiced within
the party after Obuchi's hospitalization late Sunday and
immediately triggered an electoral scramble to decide who would be
Japan's next popularly elected leader.
</P>
<P>
   With Liberal Democratic Party leaders eager for prompt elections
that would in theory give them the sympathy vote in the wake of
Obuchi's catastrophic stroke, many Diet members hastily left the
parliament after the ratification of Mori, hoping to book trains
and flights back to their districts to prepare for elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are strong feeling within L.D.P. that we should quickly
dissolve the Diet and hold elections as quickly as possible,
because the sympathy vote may be easy to get,'' said Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, a former finance minister who is a close personal friend
of Mori's. ``It is just like Jesus Christ who died and obtained the
sympathy of believers.''
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the deep superstitions that prevail in Japanese
politics, ruling party members were said to favor June 4 for the
upcoming vote, in part because the date is considered reasonably
auspicious according to Chinese astrological calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians said other considerations also prompted a quick
vote. These included the summit meeting of leading economic powers,
the Group of Eight, scheduled for July in Okinawa and the fact that
the transition of power from Obuchi to Mori, after a brief
caretaker's turn at the helm by Mikio Aoki, was regarded by many
Japanese as an episode of political razzle-dazzle unworthy of a
major economic power and putative democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki claimed that his legitimacy as caretaker was based on what
he said was a conversation he had with Obuchi during his illness,
in which he said the prime minister asked him to take over the
government temporarily. Aoki announced Obuchi's illness to the
nation 22 hours after the prime minister was hospitalized. What
ensued were further secretive rounds of maneuverings, which
produced Mori as the governing party's standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   If Mori's route to Japan's top political office was
controversial, little about his style could be described that way.
The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart is expected to
continue most of the policies of his predecessor and work hard to
avoid rocking the boat. The intended tack was made clear by Mori's
re-adoption of the entire Obuchi Cabinet, which had resigned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In case the message was lost on anyone, Mori, who was previously
his party's secretary-general, used baseball imagery in an early
morning exchange Wednesday with journalists to explain his
intentions. ``I was a catcher for Obuchi,'' he said. ``I think it
is important to carry through what he wanted to accomplish and what
he was concerned with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Mori's retention of the old Cabinet and plans to carry out
Obuchi's policies were also reminders for many that he has no
popular mandate and occupies a tenuous position as interim leader
at a time when the Liberal Democratic Party's governing coalition
is deeply unpopular and saddled with stubborn economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party's chief coalition partner, the New Komeito
Party, is a Buddhist-affiliated group that many voters disapprove
of as blurring the lines between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, sensing that the coming elections may be
their best chance in years to unseat the conservative Liberal
Democrats, who have governed for all but two years since 1955, were
quick to drive home these points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new Cabinet will demonstrate that the L.D.P. is reaching
a dead end, and I don't think that Mr. Mori will be able to break
through the wall,'' Kazuo Shii, secretary-general of the Communist
Party, said. ``It is worth mentioning that his appointment is not
something that has been submitted to the approval of the people of
Japan. More correctly, it is an appointment that defies the will of
the people of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they expressed trepidation about a possible sympathy
vote on behalf of the Liberal Democratic Party, other opposition
leaders said they felt the Japanese electorate was deeply
disillusioned with the state of the country after 10 years of
recession and a spate of recent scandals involving abuse of
authority, and would be particularly receptive to a campaign of
ideas about government reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Obuchi administration enjoyed a number of successes in
pulling Japan from the depths of a near economic meltdown in the
late 1990s. But it has kept the economy going largely through huge
spending programs on public works projects and by protecting
industries that are not competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan cannot easily abandon its heavy spending for fear
of triggering a deep recession, the country is fast approaching
dangerous levels of public debt for programs that in many cases
will never prove productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next election will be a battle between the L.D.P. and its
coalition partners, which are wasting public funds by scattering
money about for public works, versus an opposition, which is very
serious about structural reform,'' said Naoto Kan, the policy chief
of the Democratic Party of Japan, the leading opposition group.
``In terms of message, I think things will be very clear.''

NET GIVES SINGLES A SCREENING ROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA WEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Falling in love has never been rational. Humphrey Bogart just
couldn't resist Lauren Bacall's sharp blue-green eyes. For
Katharine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy was ``irresistible'' at first
sight.
</P>
<P>
   But these days, millions of single Americans, many already tied
to their computers for most of their working hours, are taking a
rational approach as they seek love via the magic of modems. And
besides, who's got the time now for person-to-person courting?
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new phenomenon. But if the volume of people seeking
companionship via the Internet even approaches the numbers claimed
by online dating companies, it indicates the industry is evolving
from a fringe lonely hearts business to a legitimate Web service.
It could also upend society's unwritten rules about how people
meet, mingle, and couple. For one thing, it's a world where
spelling, punctuation, and grammar, not clothes, can make the
person.
</P>
<P>
   Cerebral as this all sounds, many singles say it's an efficient
way to screen others.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get a lot more information about the person before
meeting,'' said Ethan Brown, 28, a lawyer from Weston. ``You can
e-mail them and correspond for a while. It's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown met Jodi Constantine, 29, a postdoctorate researcher at
Harvard, through Boston-based People2People.com, and they've been
dating for six months.
</P>
<P>
   People2People, and two other big sites, Match.com and
Matchmaker.com, boast of anywhere from 1 million to 4 million
members each, hooking thousands more each day with free trial
offers. Industry officials say most members are young professionals
in their 20s and 30s without the time to look for other singles in
bars or other places they might gather, and older never-marrieds,
divorced, or widowed men and women who don't want to.
</P>
<P>
   Cyber-dating is more intellectual than physical, more rational
than emotional, yet some say more intimate. In most cases, members
type and edit their mini-biographies (including data such as age,
hometown, religion, education, and sometimes income level), as well
as write a short essay.
</P>
<P>
   Using fictitious code names, they also enter qualities they want
in their would-be lovers. Few are bold enough to offer a picture.
The computer synthesizes the data, then delivers ``matches,'' often
hundreds within a short distance from where the member lives.
</P>
<P>
   Though the sites claim a formidable success rate, others think
people like Brown and Constantine just got lucky. Some
psychologists and sociologists who study romance don't see e-dating
as a promising method. First, early on, there's no context of voice
or accent, face or expression. In anonymous exchanges, it's easy to
lie. And the mind doesn't always know what the heart wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flies in the face of how romance works,'' said Thomas
Lewis, a psychiatrist and co-author of a book, ``A General Theory
of Love,'' published this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't know what they want,'' said Lewis, who is
also an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at the
University of California in San Francisco. ``They may put in the
criteria that matches what their thinking brain says, but their
emotional brain operates with a different set of operation
instructions that are not rational.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book, Lewis talks about three sections of the brain: the
``reptilian brain'' that makes the heart beat and blood flow, the
``neo-cortex brain'' that does the intellectual work and scheming,
and the ``limbic brain'' that is full of irrational emotion and
guides our choices in love.
</P>
<P>
   He said the limbic brain is shaped at an early age, affected
largely by our childhood experiences about what types of looks,
smells, gestures, strides, and expressions we grew up with and are
now likely to respond to on a visceral level. Humans often don't
know what their limbic brain wants.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aren't we often surprised when we're attracted to someone who
doesn't match what's on our predetermined list?'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   That may be true, but some singles contend they have some
non-negotiable requirements in a romantic partner, and computer
power can be harnessed to screen and sort out these demands.
Perhaps someone only wants a Christian, a nonsmoker, or someone who
wants more children. Many sites also offer matches for gay men and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   If the information in the Match.com database is accurate, most
members are open to meeting a wide variety of people. However,
opportunities shrink for older women and shorter men, which is the
brutal truth of the dating scene in general.
</P>
<P>
   Singles who use these on-line sites say this method differs from
print personal ads or singles clubs, the popularity of which has
also exploded in recent years, because there's generally a
prolonged period of e-mail exchanges before real names are given,
phone numbers exchanged, or meetings set up.
</P>
<P>
   With the blessing of executives at Match.com, the Boston Globe
entered a number of fictitious profiles to gauge what sort of
people the company's members were looking for. None of the matches
were followed up with correspondence to members.
</P>
<P>
   A fictitious woman, for example, seeking to date men within 25
miles of her home got anywhere from 350 to 500 ``matches.'' (That's
when both sides matched each other's criteria not all, but most of
the time.)
</P>
<P>
   That high hit rate held steady whether our lady was 25 or 45,
went from being agnostic to Christian to Jewish to Buddhist, turned
from Caucasian to African-American to Asian, or transformed from
heavy to slim.
</P>
<P>
   Her prospects dropped when she turned 50, however, she still
pulled 180 matches.
</P>
<P>
   A fictitious bachelor also got anywhere from 300 to 500 matches
under a similar variety of scenarios. What began to diminish a
man's chances was the issue of height. Still, a guy who was 5 feet
4 inches got about 150 matches.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned members, however, say information in profiles _ even
pictures _ can be unreliable.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-year-old man who works in medical sales said he once met a
woman through JDate.com, a site for Jewish singles, who didn't look
anything like her picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said to me, `By the way, I've gained 20 pounds since my
picture,' '' said the man, who gave his name only as Marc.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a huge level of editorial shaping,'' said David
Givens, an anthropologist who runs the nonprofit Center for
Nonverbal Studies in Spokane, Wash. ``That's the danger with words.
They're conscious and you can manipulate them. Face-to-face, you
might be able to choose your clothing or hairstyle. But otherwise,
you're there. It's you.''
</P>
<P>
   Shaping image through the written word can have its benefits,
said a 49-year-old single mother, who asked to remain anonymous.
She likes the chance to take the time to express in writing who she
is, though she acknowledges that this method favors the highly
literate.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you saw me at bar, you wouldn't walk in and say, `Wow!' ''
said the woman, who is also a therapist. ``But I can write a letter
that will make you say, `Wow!' It allows me to show how I think,
how I write, and how I react to things.''
</P>
<P>
   For her, the biggest downside of Web matchmaking sites is that
two people become vulnerable to quick intimacy, within the romantic
``confessional booth'' of private e-mail exchanges.
</P>
<P>
   Sherry Turkle, a sociology professor at Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, who specializes in technology's effects on human
behavior, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you give someone small amounts of written information, the
other person will construct the rest,'' she said. ``Then when the
two meet, there's this sense you already know each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Most singles say cyber-matchmaking works best if participants
are aware of its pitfall and use it as an extra, not only, method
of meeting people. There's no shortcut to love, said James Gleick,
a journalist and author of ``Faster,'' which focuses on today's
technology-driven hurried life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sizing someone up is always time-consuming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   And in e-dating, different prejudices are at play. Said Lori
Orleck, a 38-year-old single woman: ``If someone has misspelled
words or bad grammar, I won't even look at them.''
</P>
<P>
   When rejection occurs, cyber-dating offers new ways of turning
people away. You don't have to give a stammering excuse or turn
your back.
</P>
<P>
   One side hits the ``delete'' button instead of ``reply,'' and
the other side, perhaps mercifully, reads on the computer screen,
``No messages.''

URGING POLICE TO REACH FOR TACTICS, NOT GUNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Gary Moskowitz is disturbed by one thing, above all
else, in the spate of police shootings that have gripped this city.
In nearly every case, the officers have approached the victim-to-be
with their guns out of the holsters, ready to fire.
</P>
<P>
   All too often, he knows, the police rely on their guns because
they have not been trained to rely on much else.
</P>
<P>
   Moskowitz, 43, a former New York police officer, is trying to
change this situation. He runs a private company in Queens called
American Law Enforcement Restraint Tactics (ALERT), which trains
people in martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   His students have included security guards, ordinary citizens,
and about 200 members of the New York Police Deptartment, who have
come to him in their free time and paid him out of their own
pockets, to learn how to handle tense situations without drawing
their guns.
</P>
<P>
   David Goldenberg, 39, a New York police officer who patrols the
Bronx, has been taking classes with Moskowitz for several years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've used Gary's techniques in confronting emotionally
disturbed people, in making street arrests where there's
resistance, with violent kids,'' he said. ``It's saved my life
several times.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Police Department gives an all-day training course
in nonlethal defensive tactics for patrol officers, but it is not
mandatory and it lasts just one day. At the end, the trainer
advises officers to take a private martial arts course if they want
to learn more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why should cops have to go take private lessons?'' Moskowitz
exclaimed. ``Let the NYPD pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Moskowitz, who worked in the NYPD from 1982 to 1991 as an
undercover narcotics officer and a mediator for youth gangs, has a
personal stake here. He would like the NYPD to hire his company to
teach an official course. He has offered his services in the past,
but to no avail. He is lobbying state legislators to pass a law
requiring officers to be trained in these methods.
</P>
<P>
   But, he maintains, there is more than self-interest in his plea.
``Cops have to qualify with their handguns,'' he said. ``Why
shouldn't they have to qualify with their hands?''
</P>
<P>
   The danger, otherwise, is not only that officers sometimes shoot
people they don't need or mean to shoot. It's also that a lot of
officers wind up injured.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once they have their gun out and they realize they can't use
it,'' Moskowitz said, ``it becomes like a heavy paperweight in
their hand. They can't protect themselves and their weapon at the
same time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing these techniques would also improve community
relations,'' he said. ``A lot of cops hurt people when they do use
their hands. They don't mean to. It's not their fault. They don't
have the training. If people know the cop's been through training,
that he's tried these techniques before having to beat up a bad guy
or shoot him, they might be more willing to give the police the
benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   One night last week, Moskowitz gave a demonstration of his
techniques. He played a police officer, while Goldenberg played an
assailant.
</P>
<P>
   Goldenberg is a tall, trim man who works out with weights. He
came at his teacher with fists, chokeholds, a knife, and a (fake)
gun. But Moskowitz, though considerably shorter, subdued him easily
with each attack.
</P>
<P>
   In one exercise, Goldenberg grabbed for the teacher's gun. ``You
don't need to grapple and struggle for it, that's a lot of
nonsense,'' Moskowitz said. Then with a quick move and a twist of
the wrist _ the whole struggle lasted two seconds _ he forced the
gun out of Goldenberg's grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing is,'' Moskowitz said, ``you don't have to be
in great physical shape to learn these things. It's all technique.
You don't need to learn many skills, but you have to apply your
skills to many situations. You have to work it into your instincts.
That takes time and practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Moskowitz held up a long baton made of hard foam. ``Every
patrol car should have one of these,'' he said. ``You have a guy
coming at you with a knife, you can take him down, upset his
balance, no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled the incident last year when officers in Brooklyn
shot a mentally disturbed Hasidic Jew named Gideon Busch after he
came at them with a hammer. ``If they'd had this, that shooting
wouldn't have had to happen,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Moskowitz does not argue that police should never take out their
guns. ``Cops have to take out their gun quite often,
legitimately,'' he said. ``There are times when shooting is the
only thing you can do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, five young men in Brooklyn held up two undercover
officers at gunpoint, not knowing they were police. The officers
took out their own guns and fired, killing two. They later
discoverd that the men were holding toy guns.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming the initial reports of what happened are true,
Moskowitz defended this shooting. ``A cop has to defend himself and
there are times when there's no other way,'' he said. ``The kind of
`restraint tactics' I teach are for situations when the other guy
is unarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been virtually no community outrage over Friday's
shooting. People seem to draw a distinction between this incident
and the others that have called police tactics and training into
question.
</P>
<P>
   The four undercover officers who shot Amadou Diallo last year
all had their guns drawn when they approached him on his porch in
the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, an officer shot Malcolm Ferguson, a Bronx drug
dealer, while chasing him in his stairwell. The officer had drawn
his gun as he chased him. Ferguson was shot during a struggle for
the gun.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Patrick Dorismond was killed while scuffling with
an undercover detective who had asked him for drugs, when a gun
carried by a back-up officer went off.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, an officer chased a drug dealer through a school
playground in Brooklyn _ filled with children _ with his gun drawn.
The officer was put on desk duty for inappropriate behavior.

REACHING $1 MILLION MEANS A BIG UPTICK IN SAVINGS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Q. My husband contributes 7 percent of his salary to his
401(k), which comes to $485 a month with the company match. We are
very risk tolerant and would like our investments to be worth $1
million in 10 years. How should we streamline our portfolio to
maximize growth? Should I take the money out of my mother's IRA
over five years, or take it all now and accept the tax bite?
</P>
<P>
   R.W., Long Beach, Calif. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I'm afraid I'm going to have to be a bit of a wet blanket:
Unless you dramatically increase your savings rate, you are
unlikely to reach $1 million in this portfolio after 10 years. To
do so would require a 20.69 percent average annual return from your
investments, and recent market years notwithstanding, that seems to
me very unlikely. A more comfortable projection of market returns
over a decade is 10 percent, and that growth level would take you
to only $381,269. You would have to contribute $3,506 a month to
get to $1 million in 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   I think your expectations are unrealistic. This is particularly
true given the fact that we are probably very near the end of a
bull market of unprecedented proportions, and when it comes to an
end, the market will probably require a prolonged period in the
doldrums before it moves to a new growth phase.
</P>
<P>
   That is not to say I'd advise you against the market, just lower
your expectations. The first move I'd make would be to transfer the
balances in your bond, CD, and money market accounts to stocks. In
the case of the two bond holdings, I'd consolidate the IRA account
in AARP GNMA and US Treasury into Vanguard Index 500, and move the
small accumulation in Fidelity Investment Grade Bond in your
husband's 401(k) into Fidelity Spartan US Equity Index.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest you transfer both the inherited money market and CD
accounts to Vanguard Index 500 _ or to Vanguard Index Growth if you
really want to take a bullish position and believe I'm wrong about
the near-term prospects for the stock markets.
</P>
<P>
   You'll have to examine your own tax situation to determine the
best way to take your withdrawals from the IRA, but it appears most
likely you'd be best off by taking more or less equal distributions
within the five-year period that's allowed you.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on another tax matter, I would question whether you are
really getting the desired bang for the buck in the Vanguard
tax-exempt fund. Sure, you're paying no state or federal taxes, but
the returns are accordingly meager. If you really want to aim for
maximum growth, I suggest you transfer this money to USAA
Aggressive Growth and face the tax bills as they come due.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How should I best invest the money in my 401(k) account? I
will be retiring in 18 months because of heart problems. Social
Security will be my main income. I was wondering if I could take
anything out of the 401(k) without touching the principal?
</P>
<P>
   W.P., Dracut, Mass. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, neither of your two 401(k) holdings is producing much
in the way of yield. Courier Corp.'s dividends represent just 1.8
percent of its share price as this is written, and the yield on
Vanguard's Index 500 is an appalling 1.11 percent, indicating, at
least to me, how far ahead of the fundamentals the market has run.
</P>
<P>
   If you simply took the yield from these two holdings to provide
a supplemental income stream, it would bring in only $3,730 a year.
Looking at the 14 investment options available in your 401(k) plan,
it seems to me that the Strong Government Securities fund is the
best candidate for producing an income stream. The fund, which
invests in intermediate-term government-backed bonds, has a current
yield of 5.72 percent. If all of your money were in this fund, you
could expect an annual income stream of $14,682, quite a
difference.
</P>
<P>
   However, I don't suggest you move everything there. It would be
nice if you could leave some of your money in Vanguard Index 500,
which would provide the prospect for some long-term growth that
might protect you against the ravages of inflation on your income
stream later on.
</P>
<P>
   My suggestion: Begin by working out a retirement budget,
carefully and realistically calculating how much you would need to
live. For example, if you decided you could get by on $24,000 a
year, that would mean a requirement of $9,600 a year to supplement
Social Security. Thus you might put $170,000 of your 401(k) savings
into the Strong fund, leaving $86,683 in Vanguard Index 500.
</P>
<P>
   Bond funds are not without risk _ note the 1.1 percent loss for
the Strong fund last year _ but over the long haul the bad seasons
for bond funds, which are caused by rising interest rates, are
offset by subsequent gains, which are the result of falling rates.
With good fixed-income funds such as this, you can expect the
principal value to change very little in the long haul, which the
income keeps rolling in. Study the fund's past performance before
you make any move.
</P>
<P>
   I would suggest you focus more on the long-term results than
recent history. For example, its 10-year total return has been 8.08
percent, which wins it a four-star, or above-average, grade from
Morningstar Mutual Funds. And despite the risk level inherent in
the bond fund, a 401(k) portfolio divided between Strong Government
Securities and Vanguard Index 500 would be considerably safer than
your current holdings.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. A good possibility exists that I will be getting married
soon. A concern from my point of view is that my fiancee expects
her investments and some future inheritance to be enough for her
retirement. She has a tough time understanding that this is not
enough. I explained about inflation, but she counters that we will
be debt free and we don't want a lavish lifestyle. We fall into the
middle-income bracket, with blue-collar jobs. She is divorced with
two children. I just need to see some basic figures of where we
will be in 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   K.S., Bethlehem, Pa. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Despite your fiancee's disinclination to talk about it, I
suggest you have the discussion _ or fight, if it comes to that _
now rather than later. It could be as instructive about your
character and prospects together as a long session with a lawyer
working out a prenuptial agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Since the amount of the anticipated inheritance isn't certain,
I'll just focus on that $50,000 now in retirement savings. If you
waited 20 years to retire, and if her nest egg grew by an average
10 percent annually, she would have $366,410 in the account. But if
inflation averaged 3.5 percent during the same period, it would
have the buying power of about $184,000 in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   Put another way, you might expect that savings pool to produce
an annual income stream that is the equivalent of $5,460 in today's
money. Worse, since she would _ or should _ want to keep part of
her retirement funds invested for growth so as to protect her
against the likely effects of inflation later in her retirement
years, she probably shouldn't count on an income stream equivalent
to about $4,000 in today's money.
</P>
<P>
   I hope figures such as those will get her attention. If not, you
might put it to her another way. Every $1 saved today would have a
dollar value of $7.33 if it is invested for 20 years and returns 10
percent. But if inflation runs at 3.5 percent, that dollar would
have the buying power of $3.685 in today's money. After 20 years
you could expect a dollar saved today to produce an income stream
equivalent to about 2.4 cents in today's money. So it's important
for her not only to keep saving, but also to do it sooner rather
than later.

<P>
   SEATTLE _ Red Sox Cy Young honorees have not always followed
their award-winning seasons with fast starts. Jim Lonborg, who won
the award in 1967, hurt himself skiing and limped into the 1968
season. After winning the trophy in 1986, Roger Clemens walked out
of 1987 spring training over a contract dispute and endured a
sluggish April.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Martinez, on the other hand, has picked up where he left
off in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching the first game of the second century of Red Sox
baseball Tuesday night, Pedro struck out 11 Seattle Mariners and
gave up only two hits in seven innings of a 2-0 victory. This comes
on the heels of his 23-4, 2.07, 313-strikeout season.
</P>
<P>
   Where does it end? Pedro is only 28 years old. Does he just keep
throwing zeroes throughout the month, season, decade? Are hitters
ever going to catch up to the Dominican righty who is no bigger
than your typical high school junior?
</P>
<P>
   Asked to assess the efforts of the Mariners, Pedro stated,
``They swung. Did they find the ball? No. But they tried.''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, they tried. Two of them struck out in the first. Two more
in the second. Two in the third. Three in the fourth. Two in the
fifth. Pedro settled down after that. He let the Mariners get
themselves out.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were starting to swing more, getting desperate, getting
easier outs,'' he said of his last two innings.
</P>
<P>
   In a move that worked perfectly, according to the February
blueprint, Pedro handed the ball to Derek Lowe in the eighth and
the goofy righty retired all six batters he faced for the save.
</P>
<P>
   The pregame festivities were somewhat hideous. Fans applauded
when the retractable roof was rolled back, and none of the Pacific
Northwesterners seemed to mind the chilly conditions (50 degrees).
</P>
<P>
   ``Compared to Boston during the playoffs, this was Dominican
weather,'' said Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   After the Sox were introduced, the public address system played
the ``Mr. Mojo Risin' '' part from the Doors' ``LA Woman,'' then
the Mariners appeared, one by one, through a smoke-filled gate in
the right-field fence. The players ran down a red carpet to the
first base line. No Junior Griffey. The biggest hand went to Alex
Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   The roof was put back in place for the start of the game, but
the chill remained. Safeco Field is an open-air stadium. When the
roof covers the field, it's like being in a convertible with the
top on and the windows open. The ball doesn't carry. Small wonder
Griff left. No one's going to hit 756 homers playing here.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Bud Selig threw out the first ball and was soundly
booed. In Seattle, Selig is best-known as the man who stole the
Pilots and made them the Milwaukee Brewers after the 1969 season.
None too affected, the commissioner wore a Safeco Field name tag
that read, ``Bud Selig.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pedro Martinez is a great pitcher and great for baseball,''
said the commissioner as he watched Martinez shred the Seattle
lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro took the mound at 5:20. He blew hot air on his hand during
warmups. On this night he did not have the luxury of pitching to
Seattle right fielder Jay Buhner, who is 0 for 8 lifetime against
Pedro, all strikeouts. Manager Lou Piniella decided it was best to
give the slugger a night off even if it was the opener on national
television. Such is the impact of Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   His first pitch of 2000 was a called strike to center fielder
Mike Cameron. Cameron struck out, swinging, on five pitches.
Welcome to the new millennium. Mark McLemore was next and he fanned
on a 3-and-2 pitch. Alex Rodriguez walked on four pitches. So much
for the perfect game. Pedro went to 2-and-0 on John Olerud (six
balls in a row), before getting the new Mariner cleanup man on a
hard fly to left.
</P>
<P>
   He got the side in order in the second, then fanned Dan Wilson
to open the third. But No. 9 batter Carlos Guillen fought off a
2-and-2 pitch and dumped a single to center. So much for the
no-hitter. But the shutout would be preserved.
</P>
<P>
   In a battle of Dominican-born All-Stars, Pedro fanned Rodriguez
on a 96-mile-per-hour fastball to start the fourth. After Olerud
scorched a single past Nomar Garciaparra (and took second on a
passed ball), Pedro caught Edgar Martinez looking at a 3-and-2
strike, then blazed a 93-m.p.h. heater past John Mabry to end the
inning. On the upper-deck facade in left center, A group of Boston
fans showed nine K-Cards after four.
</P>
<P>
   ``He does his most serious work when there's men in scoring
position,'' said Sox general manager Dan Duquette.
</P>
<P>
   The Ace of Diamonds struck out two more Mariners in the fifth,
then got the rest of his outs on harmless grounders and fly balls.
He threw 108 pitches, 60 for strikes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had better command after the fifth,'' he said. ``I felt
pretty confident, but I wouldn't say I knew I was gonna have a good
game. I just had a good day. I was throwing the ball well.''
</P>
<P>
   As he has all spring, he rejected the notion that fans should
expect a repeat of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't look for it,'' said Pedro. ``A year like that
happens. Gibson. Koufax. You can put that season right in there.
Those are special seasons and they don't come every day. You can't
think about it. You'd go crazy. I'm not gonna stop and think about
it. That's behind. That's gone.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro improved to 3-0 with 31 strikeouts in three Sox openers.
Wednesday night, the cowhide torch is passed to brother Ramon.

ANY FRIEND OF MR. FUSSY'S IS PROBABLY . . . LONELY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mr. Fussy is very, very fussy about people.
</P>
<P>
   What kind of people does Mr. Fussy like? To start with, he likes
people who like him, because they show good taste. Here is a
passage from Fay Weldon's novel, ``Big Girls Don't Cry,'' that
summarizes Mr. F's position nicely. The well-heeled Layla is
explaining to her less fortunate boarder, Stephanie, why she is
being evicted:
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to share my home with someone who keeps telling
me the truth,'' said Layla. ``I want to fill it with people who
admire me and worship me, and that's not you.''
</P>
<P>
   It would be an exaggeration to say that Mr. Fussy's house is
filled with admirers and worshippers. Familiarity breeds grudging
acknowledgement is the watchword there. The people Mr. Fussy likes
best are the people he doesn't know. There's still hope for them.
In theory, at least.
</P>
<P>
   Certain kinds of people are annoying: overachievers, for
instance. She's a world-renowned oncologist; he invented a Web site
that sells gasoline over the Internet; their children attend the
private school of the moment, and are beta testers for Microsoft _
how can you not feel small? You exchange a few words on the
sidewalk and, inevitably, her cell phone chirrups forth. Her
presence is required at a World Health Organization conference in
Geneva. What can you possibly say, other than: Can I drive you to
the airport?
</P>
<P>
   Appearances can be very helpful in sorting out people. ``Teeth
are important,'' observed Burt Bacharach, one of People magazine's
``50 Most Beautiful People Ever,'' and he was right. Teeth are
important. But skin is very important, too. Mr. Fussy only wishes
that fathers taught their young sons more about moisturizers and
less about hitting a curve ball (impossible, anyway). Look at
Robert Redford _ a lifetime wasted in the sun! But Mr. F digresses.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know how ``socially responsible'' investors pick stocks?
They set up ``screens'' to weed out evil corporations, the ones
that sell tobacco, exploit Third World labor, or print unposed
celebrity photos. So Mr. Fussy has devised his own screens through
which strangers must pass in order to enter his peculiar orbit.
</P>
<P>
   1) They must live either very nearby, or very far away,
preferably, in a castle in Ireland. With halfway people one can
never make up one's mind. Mr. Fussy sees his friends in Seattle
much more often than he sees his friends in Stockbridge, for
instance.
</P>
<P>
   2) Not too tall. Tall people are too imposing, too superior. But
not too short, either. Too many hang-ups.
</P>
<P>
   3) Too rich is OK.
</P>
<P>
   4) NNPNA: No Night People Need Apply. Mr. Fussy is a Day Person.
He works very hard from early morning until about lunch time, then
he just throws in the towel. At the newspaper where Mr. Fussy
works, he occasionally meets the movie reviewers or the rock music
critics, stumbling into work just as Mr. F. is leaving. As far as
he is concerned, they are nice people who may as well be working in
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   5)Movies can be useful screening tools. Did you like ``Pulp
Fiction?'' Mr. and Mrs. Fussy walked out. Anything by Robert Altman
is acceptable, even the critically savaged ``Gingerbread Man.'' And
if you enjoyed the Brazilian cannibal classic ``Macunaima,'' well,
soup's on! You're a candidate for friend for life.
</P>
<P>
   6) Phone etiquette is very important to Mr. Fussy. Rule No. 1:
Don't Call. Rule No. 2: If you must call, don't call at night. Rule
No. 3: If you must leave a message, make it very brief, e.g.
``Hello, Mr. Fussy. It's me. Goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Here is the typical, unacceptably long phone message: ``Hi, Mr.
Fussy, it's _ Oh, this cord is getting all tangled _ hi, it's Mary,
remember, I said I would call you today, Thursday, because you
probably remember that we had discussed doing that thing with
Robert, and I'm really not sure. . .'' Mary is a leading candidate
for Call Blocking, the handy new sociopathic feature available on
many telephones.
</P>
<P>
   7) No golf, no golf, no golf. If Mr. Fussy never hears the
g-word again in this lifetime, it will be too soon.
</P>
<P>
   So _ can we be friends?
</P>
<P>
   (With gratitude and apologies to the late Roger Hargreaves,
creator of the wonderful children's book character Mr. Fussy.)

<P>
   Morning, noon, and night, their hopes soar or plunge with the
gyrations of the Nasdaq exchange, which advertises itself as the
``stock market for the digital world.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq maniacs withstand the precipitous declines in their stock
index, such as the one last week, with the devotion of sports fans.
If the index continues its Friday rebound this week, they know the
feeling will be sublime.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq watchers are everywhere today _ lurking in suburban
homes, office cubicles, RVs, airports.
</P>
<P>
   William Sheskey ambles down to the sunny kitchen in his Hingham
home each morning, and, in a ritual of retirement, eats a breakfast
prepared by his wife while tuning in to CNBC Network to see how the
Nasdaq is doing.
</P>
<P>
   What he sees all day long is Tom Costello, the Nasdaq
correspondent for CNBC, broadcasting market updates from Nasdaq's
new storefront in Times Square. Tourists peer into the picture
window for a glimpse of Costello, a glance at the index. Is it up
or down? Did MicroStrategy's stock price explode or fizzle?
</P>
<P>
   When James Paragamian returns home from his job as a stock
broker in downtown Washington, D.C., each evening, 9-year-old Matt
asks, ``How'd the Nasdaq do today, dad?'' Paragamian says. ``He
doesn't ask how the Dow did. He asks how the Nasdaq did.''
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq, home to the four horsemen of high-tech _ Cisco Systems,
Microsoft, Intel, and Oracle _ has eclipsed the Dow Jones
industrial average as the index to watch for this nation of
investors, online traders, and tech junkies.
</P>
<P>
   Nasdaq ``has come as close to the new national obsession as
anything we have,'' said Antonio Cecin, director of stock trading
for US Bancorp Piper Jaffray, a Minneapolis investment firm that
creates markets in Nasdaq-listed stocks.
</P>
<P>
   As the public and corporate America stampede into tech stocks,
Nasdaq _ which, like the Internet itself, is no more than a vast
network of interlinked computers, a virtual place _ has become the
world's biggest stock exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq, established in 1971 and once home to dubious,
small-company stocks, has a new reputation as the place to be for a
long line of young companies. Its trading volume now far
outdistances the quintessential establishment trading floor, the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The storefront in Times Square is, in fact, sheer advertising.
No trading, and little exchange business, goes on there. Its
purpose is a garish display, adding to the bright lights and
scrolling news zippers blanketing Broadway and grabbing the
attention of tourists likely to walk away with a Nasdaq key chain
or coffee mug.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's absolutely entertainment,'' says Robert Shiller, a Yale
University economics professor, repeating a theme from his book,
``Irrational Exuberance.'' ``That is one thing that drives this
boom _ people have found a new diversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, people aren't just watching. They are investing. Like
never before, the public _ housewives, police officers, waiters,
retirees _ is putting an enormous amount of money into
Nasdaq-listed technology stocks, placing high-risk bets on the new
economy.
</P>
<P>
   Investors pushed the Nasdaq index through the 5,000 barrier
briefly, on March 9. Share volume on the exchange smashes record
after record: Eight of the 10 largest-volume days all occurred in
March _ the other two were in February. That's due to a torrent of
orders from discount brokers, and from mutual fund giants such as
Fidelity Investments, whose specialty technology fund quadrupled in
size, to $80 billion, in five years.
</P>
<P>
   And why not? Those who went with Nasdaq, shunning the dowdy Dow,
have made boatloads of money. What could be more fun? Neither a
correction in the index last week, nor warnings by investment
professionals, have deterred nascent speculators. ``The new
economy,'' said Kenneth Heebner, a veteran Boston money manager,
``is an illusion. It's a word that allows people to feel
comfortable with paying ridiculous prices for stocks.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If stocks start going down, the obsession (with
Nasdaq) would disappear real quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the Nasdaq's relentless rise only lures more people into
its sticky web; wild price swings are rationalized as a bump on the
road to more winnings for an index that gained an extraordinary 86
percent last year and is now at five times its 1995 level. Despite
last week's plunge, the index is up 12 percent so far this year _
more than most stocks, and stock market indexes, gain in an entire
year.
</P>
<P>
   Warren Mattox has an acute case of Nasdaq obsession.
</P>
<P>
   Up at dawn, he logs on to the laptop in his Mt. Vernon, Va.,
home to see how Nasdaq futures contracts are faring before US stock
markets open. In his photography studio, where portraits of
presidents Johnson through Clinton and comedian Lucille Ball hang,
Mattox monitors six computer screens. He's tracking the Nasdaq's
swings. He's watching his Nasdaq-listed stocks. He's checking for
stock tips on stockwinners.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would rather watch my Bloomberg (terminal) than go to the
movies,'' said Mattox, a 30-year investor.
</P>
<P>
   He said he made so much money last year _ ``six figures'' _ he
was able to buy his wife a topaz-colored Jaguar XK8 convertible
2000 with a navigation system. ``You have to be disciplined and
focused,'' he said. ``It's like driving a race car. You take your
eye off of it, and you crash.''
</P>
<P>
   You have to be obsessed.
</P>
<P>
   Individuals swept up in Nasdaq stocks ``see all these people
around who don't have any special insight or talent,'' said Cornell
University economist Richard Frank, ``and they're getting rich _
just by letting their investments sit in the Nasdaq. I think that
drives ordinary people nuts.'' But Frank admitted, ``I get a kick
out of my numbers every day because they're going up every day.''
</P>
<P>
   Companies are equally smitten. Aeroflex Inc., an electronics
company based in Plainview, N.Y., last month abandoned the Big
Board to list its shares on the Nasdaq _ and be associated with its
chic. ``There's the old economy and the new economy _ we're new
economy,'' said Aeroflex's president, Michael Gorin. ``It's just
that we wanted to align ourselves with our peer group.''
</P>
<P>
   As Nasdaq's popularity grows, it has established an identity
even among casual investors, such as retiree Sheskey. Investment
professionals, reviewing the day's events on Wall Street, no long
confine analysis to the Dow. Increasingly, they talk of the money
sloshing from Nasdaq to the Dow and back _ causing one market to
fall and the other to fly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't pay nearly as much attention to the Dow as I do the
Nasdaq, because I'm in the new-economy stocks,'' explained Sheskey,
a former shoe industry executive.
</P>
<P>
   Such an attitude, shared by a growing public, is welcomed by
Nasdaq officials who, only a decade ago, succeeded in a
public-relations campaign to persuade nightly news programs to
broadcast Nasdaq's daily moves _ right after the Dow's.
</P>
<P>
   Today, an entire network devotes much of its broadcast time to
Nasdaq: CNBC. True, CNBC deploys Maria Bartiromo on the floor of
the New York Stock Exchange for the popular morning stock show. But
the star is Nasdaq. Host Joe Kernan trots out screen after screen
of stock charts resembling the Alps before investors' eyes.
</P>
<P>
   CNBC, which had only 19,000 households tuning in daily in 1996,
claims 375,000 households do so now. CNBC's investment daily
business programming is so popular, the television show is a new
kind of wallpaper for retail establishments, from a barber shop
near the Astor Place subway stop in Manhattan that airs the
program, to a Waltham health club where cyclists gaze at a TV set
during lunch-hour workouts.
</P>
<P>
   As with any fad, Nasdaq's rise occurred with lightning speed.
Alternative computerized trading forums are in ascendance and may
just as quickly usurp it.
</P>
<P>
   Already, trading by investment professionals and casual
investors has begun a shift: Day-traders at home buy and sell
stocks with market makers on Wall Street. Retirees buy stocks via
online trading firms, never lifting a telephone to call a broker.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're really at the dawn of a new marketplace,'' said Antonio
Cecin, the Minneapolis market maker. Things are happening so fast,
he added, ``none of us knows what it all means.''

MONEY PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; BOSTON _ Neither would look very good in a push-up bra. And
they would never, ever be caught in spike heels at the office.
</P>
<P>
   But like Erin Brockovich, who in the person of Julia Roberts
looked darn good in both, Brian J.X. Murphy and Edward Notargiacomo
spent endless hours at their law firm helping win a giant
class-action suit against Big Business. When the jihad ended the
real-life, Brockovich walked away with real money, $2 million in
cash. Murphy and Notargiacomo got a few weeks' severance pay and
were shown the door.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick Freed &AMP; Gesmer just can't understand how it has
come to be typecast as a firm of greedy lawyers after winning the
biggest settlement in the history of the Commonwealth _ $8.3
billion _ against Big Tobacco. Hint: Greed, exploitation and
arrogance are no more attractive in a law firm than a tobacco
company.
</P>
<P>
   In February, I told you about the donnybrook that had erupted
inside Brown Rudnick over the $178 million the firm had been
awarded over the next 25 years for its role in the litigation.
Thomas Sobol, the firm's lead attorney on the case, announced he
was leaving. Brown Rudnick said OK, but you're not getting your
share of the settlement, by far the largest in the firm.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the case of Brian Murphy and Ed Notargiacomo.
</P>
<P>
   The two were part of a team of young attorneys Brown Rudnick
used to reduce the costs of the high-risk litigation. Of roughly 11
attorneys who worked primarily on the tobacco litigation team, half
were so-called contract lawyers who, like Murphy and Notargiacomo,
were paid as little as $18 an hour and got no benefits. They worked
up to 80 hours a week, shared offices, computers and telephones and
had no secretarial help.
</P>
<P>
   But by Brown Rudnick's own telling this pool of cut-rate talent
played an important role in the litigation. Several, including
Murphy and Notargiacomo, were sworn in as special assistant
attorneys general. ``No attorney in the case defended more public
health-related depositions,'' George K. Weber, the head of the
attorney general's tobacco team, said of Murphy in a letter of
recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Nancy Reiner, who was Sobol's chief deputy at Brown Rudnick,
said Murphy was ``quickly singled out'' for his ability to think
``big picture'' and look ``outside the box.'' Wrote Reiner: ``Brian
was able to predict issues no one else had thought of.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Brown Rudnick attorney, James McGuire, praised
Notargiacomo's ``extraordinary contributions'' to the case.
</P>
<P>
   Both worked about 20 months on the case. When it was settled,
Murphy, 29, was dumped with six weeks of severance pay;
Notargiacomo, 32, with four weeks. The other contract attorneys
were also let go.
</P>
<P>
   The two say ``promises were made,'' and asked Brown Rudnick to
make good. Although the four other law firms in the Massachusetts
case awarded Brown Rudnick $23 million for the extra work the firm
put in, the requests of Murphy and Notargiacomo amount to peanuts:
$120,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Brown Rudnick to the two lawyers: drop dead. ``When your
services were no longer necessary, the Firm made a gift to you of
six weeks weeks additional compensation, a gift the Firm was under
no obligation to make,'' Brown Rudnick wrote to Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   Andre Jasse, Brown Rudnick's chairman, said all regular
employees got a one-time bonus earlier this year from the tobacco
money that totalled $1.5 million. ``I believe we have treated all
our staff, including contract lawyers, fairly,'' he said in a
statement Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Not long from now, Brown Rudnick will sue the state for the
balance of the fee it says it is owed under the original agreement.
That money, which could top $300 million, would come out of the
state's part of the settlement, not from the tobacco firms.
</P>
<P>
   And then Jasse and the other senior partners at One Financial
Center can adjourn to the club, and whine about how unfair it is to
be called a bunch of greedy lawyers. ``Waiter, another martini,
please. . .''

NO BURST BUBBLE FOR TECH MARKET, BUT A DEFINITE HISS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feeling irrationally exuberant now?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who sweated Tuesday's technology stock market through
each wrenching turn to its eventual, ho-hum close is more likely to
feel like a wet dish towel.
</P>
<P>
   By lunch time we would have sworn the bubble of wild expectation
and crazy valuation had finally burst, as many predicted. Later, it
felt more like a balloon hissing lost confidence from a bad leak.
</P>
<P>
   Stock bubbles are burst or deflated by unpredictable things,
often coming out of left field. For all of his jawboning about tech
stocks and the wealth effect, Federal Reserve chairman Alan
Greenspan would only have to look across Washington to a federal
judge for the spark to this week's activity.
</P>
<P>
   The Microsoft Corp. antitrust case and Monday's decision by US
District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson had little to do with the
direct fortunes of most technology companies. But that was enough
to trigger selling that began to feed on itself in a Nasdaq market
that had lost nearly 9 percent
</P>
<P>
   the previous week.
</P>
<P>
   To Barry Evans, Tuesday felt a lot like Oct. 15, 1989, when the
Dow Jones industrial average plunged by 6.9 percent (a mere 190.58
points at that time). The catalyst then: the closely watched
leveraged buyout planned for United Airlines parent UAL Corp. was
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually there's some sort of tag-along news like that,'' said
Evans, a senior vice president at John Hancock Funds. ``That one
told you the LBO game was over. What the Microsoft news might be
suggesting is a lot of the tech momentum is over.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you call Tuesday, it was immensely volatile and moved
at warp speed, with a record 2.7 billion Nasdaq shares changing
hands. Don't be surprised by more of the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to see a lot more volatility and high
volume,'' said Edward G. Riley, chief investment strategist at
State Street Global Advisors in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   As the day wore on, much of the afternoon recovery was pinned on
a flight to quality, or at least size. Money seemed to gravitate to
larger companies and a few, like Applied Materials Inc., a
semiconductor company, actually posted strong gains.
</P>
<P>
   This may be the way of the immediate future. Some mutual fund
managers and market analysts suggest technology stocks may fall
into one of several clusters in the short term.
</P>
<P>
   By their thinking, the giants with established business and
earnings will decline but suffer through the least volatility by
attracting and holding on to institutional investors. Another group
of companies, with solid futures but wildly inflated stock, will
keep a market following despite big price drops.
</P>
<P>
   But a category of smaller technology stocks that have counted on
Wall Street to keep funding their growing businesses will face
serious problems. Many of those stocks have been knocked down and
are least likely to get back up. Their challenge: find a way to
make money or start thinking about mergers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be the first iteration of that process,'' said
Bernice Behar, portfolio manager of the John Hancock Small Cap
Growth fund. ``I think this gets played out in a fairly complicated
fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   That would only be a bit of history repeating itself. Most
recently, the same pattern was on display when technology stocks
got clobbered in the summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a flight to safety and size, then a tier of
highfliers that were struggling to regain their impressive
valuation, and then an entire group of smaller caps which were
forgotten as more illiquid than the other two categories,''
recalled Michael Halloran, the Boston-based global head of the
technology group at Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Demand for many tech stocks may pose a problem in the weeks
ahead. And then there's the supply question.
</P>
<P>
   Investment bankers limit or virtually shut down the fat pipeline
of initial public offerings in times like these. But they can't do
anything about existing stock that will soon become available for
sale in public markets for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai Technologies Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. went public with a
bang in October, hitting the market at $26 per share and reaching a
peak of $345.50 in January. It has since retreated to $115.46875.
</P>
<P>
   But only a small portion of Akamai's shares outstanding were
actually sold to the public. The IPO of 9 million shares accounted
for less than 10 percent of its 93 million shares outstanding.
</P>
<P>
   The balance is owned by insiders, venture capitalists, and
others prohibited from selling any of their stock or exercising
options for six months. For Akamai, that's the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The booming IPO market of 1999 is creating the same type of
phenomena on a massive scale across the market. Soon, more than 2
billion shares will be unlocked and may be sold, by some counts.
</P>
<P>
   Just because insiders can sell doesn't mean they will. But their
expired lockups are a weight that may hang over the tech stock
market any time it tries to rally. How can prices move higher when
there are so many potential sellers waiting in the wings?
</P>
<P>
   Halloran thinks expiring stock lockups are a minor issue. But
several money managers said they believed the issue could hold back
many stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it goes straight to the heart of supply and demand,''
said Behar. ``No matter what the level of the market, the very
nature of those lockups very definitely are an issue we need to get
past.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ It was almost dusk when 75 African-American, Asian, and
Latino seniors from colleges around the country filed into a
banquet room at the Boston Seaport Hotel last month for dinner and
a chance to meet Al Zollar, president and chief executive of
Cambridge-based Lotus Development Corp.
</P>
<P>
   At 45, Zollar is among a small but growing number of
African-Americans nationwide who hold influential positions in
technology. ``I really want young people to understand that there
are opportunities in technology right now,'' he said. ``But they
must be prepared.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, opportunities abound. Faced with a shortfall of more
than 100,000 information technology professionals in the industry
each year and a dearth of engineering graduates, both companies and
colleges are vying for talented students.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Lord, a 17-year-old honors student at Phillips Exeter
Academy, was able to pick and choose: She was accepted to both
Stanford University and Washington University at St. Louis, and was
guaranteed admission and a $40,000 scholarship to Florida
Agricultural &AMP; Mechanical University, even though she hadn't
applied there. She ultimately chose Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   This shortage of high-tech professionals is necessitating the
diversification of a traditionally white-male industry. Women have
fought hard to break into the field and have made progress toward
the executive ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Yet at a time when there is so much to gain, few
African-Americans fill professional jobs in the exploding high-tech
market. In the Boston area, black professionals hold only 3.4
percent of the high-tech jobs. One reason, say experts: lower
college enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   Though they represent 12 percent of the overall US population,
African-Americans were awarded just 8.3 percent of the 1.2 million
bachelor's degrees conferred in 1997 _ a 66 percent increase since
1987 but still not big enough to close the technology gap, reports
the American Council on Education.
</P>
<P>
   In both Silicon Valley and Massachusetts, critics say companies
would rather hire from abroad than nurture US talent. Many
high-tech start-ups are not recruiting from the US colleges that
have higher black and Latino enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   As competition for technical professionals and savvy consumers
intensifies, however, some noteworthy alliances are being forged
among companies, minority institutions, community groups, and
public schools in a push to recruit minorities and tap what many
see as a potentially lucrative consumer market.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprising, most of these new coalitions involve the
country's more established firms. Absent from the table: Many of
the dot-coms and Internet firms credited with fueling the surging
economy.
</P>
<P>
   In Cambridge, for example, Lotus Development Corp. has matched
students from a local public school and their families with free
computers, assigning digital buddies, or mentors, who will serve as
the families' personal Internet service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Zollar, who heads Lotus, an IBM software subsidiary that will
likely gross well over $1 billion this year, credits his public
school teachers with sparking his interest in math.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did not come from a privileged background,'' he said. ``I
was good at math, but I also had a couple of teachers who inspired
me. I really had no idea what I wanted to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Zollar, who holds a bachelor's of arts degree from the
University of California at San Diego and a master's degree in
applied mathematics, credits a strong diversity program at IBM with
helping him advance.
</P>
<P>
   In all, about 600 minority college seniors, the majority of them
participants in the company's nationwide Project View recruiting
program, are hired yearly by IBM.
</P>
<P>
   Other alliances involving minority advancement in technology
include:
</P>
<P>
   --A $130 million partnership of the United Negro College Fund,
Microsoft Corp., IBM Corp., and AT&AMP;T Corp. to improve computer
access to students and faculty at black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   --The Bill Gates Millennium Scholars Program, which will award
full scholarships to 20,000 economically disadvantaged minority
students under a multimillion dollar program of the Gates
Foundation, the United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic College
Fund, the American Indian College Fund, Microsoft, and IBM.
</P>
<P>
   --America Online and Darien Dash, the 28-year-old founder and
chief executive of DME Interactive Holdings Inc., a New York
multimedia firm, are expected this month to announce details of a
multifirm partnership that will bring discounted computers,
Internet access, and low-cost urban programming to millions of
newly wired minority households.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal,'' said Dash, ``is to develop an urban branded
Internet service provider and offer access to people who have just
recently begun to take advantage of the technology.'' Programming
is expected to include distance learning, job placement, technical
certification, music, and multimedia.
</P>
<P>
   Altruism is not the sole motivation. As AOL's new urban brand,
DME's Places of Color is expected to reach millions of minority
households when it is launched this spring, a potential goldmine
for the company and its mega partner, AOL.
</P>
<P>
   --Bell Atlantic's community technology centers at local Urban
Leagues, where students can study and learn to use computers; and
Cisco Systems' alliance with the Villa Victoria housing development
in Boston's South End and a nonprofit that serves the Latino
community.
</P>
<P>
   --A coalition of business groups that is donating thousands of
dollars to fund scholarships and internships for talented youths
enrolled at historically black colleges.
</P>
<P>
   One example: Florida Agricultural &AMP; Mechanical University,
widely known as FAMU. Fifteen years after Frederick S. Humphries
became president, the college is competing with Harvard University
for top minority high school seniors. Backed by 135 major
companies, FAMU created the $40,000 four-year award, the Life Gets
Better Thurgood Marshall Scholarship, as a lure.
</P>
<P>
   These alliances offer one solution, but they're hardly enough.
``Right now, the biggest predictor of whether someone goes on to
college is the academic preparation they receive in their
elemenatary and seconday school years,'' said Jacqueline King, a
spokeswoman for the American Council on Education in Washington,
D.C. ``Marked variations in the quality of elementary and secondary
education students receive as well as social class, institutional
racism, and the notion among many American youth that it is uncool
to be a `nerd' or computer `geek,' have all played a role in
impeding advancement.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those African-Americans who, like Zollar, have climbed the
upper rungs of executive management in technology, many first
entered the industry through the doors of big technical firms such
as IBM, Digital Equipment Corp., or the nation's reigning
telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The companies, many of them federal contractors, are required by
law to diversity their ranks. But some value the synergy created
when different perspectives are shared.
</P>
<P>
   Robert E. Dowling Jr., chairman, president, and chief executive
of California-based COVAD Communications, which offers broadband
access services to the Internet, was an executive vice president at
U.S. West before assuming the top post at COVAD.
</P>
<P>
   Wharton B. (Zie) Rivers, the newly appointed president of Cable
&AMP; Wireless North America, had served as president of Ameritech's $4
billion network services division before he was named to his new
post last October.
</P>
<P>
   A bachelor's or master's degree in mathematics or computer
science is not a necessary prerequisite to advancement. Kingsley
Idehincq, president of OpenLink Software in Burlington, which sells
e-business infrastructure technology to brick-and-mortars seeking
an Internet presence, was an accountant before becoming an
entrepreneur in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Idehin, like many minority entrepreneurs, received no outside
support from local bankers or venture capitalists and relied,
instead, on $50,000 in savings to launch his company. This year, he
expects to gross $5 million in sales. These days, he counts such
firms as Lucent Technologies, the Federal Energy Reserve
Commission, AT&AMP;T, and the US Army among his 5,000 clients.
</P>
<P>
   DME Interactive's Dash, who grew up in the Bronx, graduated from
the University of Southern California in 1983 with a bachelor's in
political science. The same year he started working for Digital
Music Express, which distributed music through a cable company.
``In 1994, I saw there was a great opportunity in technology and,
especially, in the urban market,'' recalled Dash.
</P>
<P>
   He started the firm with a computer and $500, and then financed
it himself for four years before attracting financial support. Last
year, DME went public. The company reported more than $1 million in
sales in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For African-American students who do pursue bachelor's or
advanced degrees in computer science, engineering, or mathematics,
the future seems particularly bright.
</P>
<P>
   Take Peter Onyisi, a 17-year-old physics major at the University
of Chicago. Last year while still in high school, he was ranked
among the top 100 math students in the country. After scoring 800
on the quantitative portion of the Scholastic Aptitude Test and 780
on the verbal portion, Onyisi was accepted to Harvard, Princeton
University, MIT, and the California Institute of Technology. He
settled on the University of Chicago, which awarded him a full
four-year scholarship.
</P>
<P>
   IBM IT specialist and developer Diana Meadows of Allentown, Pa.,
who is finishing a doctorate in computer science, was inundated
with job offers while studying at Indiana University last year.
</P>
<P>
   A former high school dropout and hair dresser who had grown
bored with her job, Meadows returned to earn a high school
equivalency diploma, intending to pursue a career in the US Air
Force. When the Air Force rejected her because she did not have
enough course credits, Meadows enrolled at Brooklyn College.
``Essentially, I went to college for 15 credits and never left,''
she said. ``I loved it. I took Algebra, Calculus I, II, and III.,
and wound up minoring in math.''
</P>
<P>
   Meadows graduated Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Psi, and then entered
graduate school at Indiana University. Now in her 30s, she says she
was working on her doctorate last year when a bunch of companies
came knocking. She received several offers, settling on IBM, she
said, because it sent a representative to the university to meet
her. Today, Meadows makes almost twice the amount she would have
earned if she had stuck to her plan of becoming a college
professor.

THEIR SPARTAN EXISTENCE YIELDS A JUST REWARD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's a very good thing for Michigan State that the young Mateen
Cleaves was not your basic front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   He came of athletic age at a time when Wolverine Chic was taking
over the state of Michigan, not to mention countless other urban
areas. Anywhere you looked in the early and mid '90s, kids were
wearing snappy Michigan garb. The colors, after all, are classic:
blue and gold, or, as they quaintly insist in Ann Arnor, maize and
blue. And the Fab Five defined the sport for the hip-hop set. So
Michigan was very much the school of choice.
</P>
<P>
   But up there in Flint, little Mateen was thinking along
different lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I came up,'' he says, ``my father was always a Michigan
State guy. You know, I always went for the underdog, so I really
fell in love with Michigan State. I've always been a guy that roots
for the underdog. And the guards they had coming through _ Magic
Johnson, Scott Skiles, Steve Smith, Eric Snow _ I can go on and on
about the guards that played there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in Flint, Michigan was the big thing. Michigan State was
always second to Michigan. But if there was a question of Michigan
vs. Michigan State in my house, my father wouldn't allow you to
watch Michigan. You had to watch Michigan State.''
</P>
<P>
   That pretty much sums up the state of affairs in college
basketball at the conclusion of the 1999-2000 season, doesn't it?
If you want to see college basketball played at its absolute
highest, most athletic, most cohesive, and most intelligent level,
why, you simply had to watch Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   The only thing we can ask for from any athletic campaign is
justice. We don't like messy or ambiguous endings. Oh, we get them,
all right, but when we do, we simply deal with them. We don't
embrace them. But the college basketball season that concluded at
the RCA Dome Monday night supplied us with the kind of warm glow we
seek. The best team won, and they did so by bringing their Tiger
Woods ``A game'' when it was most desirable.
</P>
<P>
   That was Michigan State basketball we saw Monday night. No,
let's back it up a bit. That was Michigan State basketball we saw
both Saturday evening and Monday evening. Rarely has an aspirant to
college basketball's throne been asked to put on such radically
different faces after having arrived at the Final Four. What
Michigan State did in dispatching Wisconsin in Saturday's peach
basket 53-41 game required one sort of discipline. What Michigan
State did in slicing through the feared Florida press and then
dissecting the Gators with a well-designed half-court offense
required quite another.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can beat you, 50-45 or 90-80,'' says coach Tom Izzo.
</P>
<P>
   That's not hyperbole; that's the God's honest truth, and it's
why there shouldn't be any question as to the identity of the best
team. Sure, there are teams that could beat Michigan State in a
one-shot deal. They did lose three games even with Cleaves in the
lineup. But not even a fully healthy Cincinnati (i.e. with Kenyon
Martin) has the full range of skill Michigan State has. The
Spartans would win a seven-game series with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Now, there always seems to be two kinds of kids taking in
everything that's going on. The first are the impressionable ones,
who see something gaudy and want to partake. Cleaves, smooth
forward Morris Peterson and Charlie Bell, a junior who will inherit
Cleaves's playmaking spot next year, all come from Flint, a
hardscrabble town immortalized by documentary filmmaker Michael
Moore in ``Roger and Me.'' They could have plugged into the
Michigan thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Michigan was always on TV,'' Cleaves says. ``They had the
All-Americans. They had the flashy players and that type of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   But they chose Michigan State. They wanted to make their own
mark. Along with senior A.J. Granger and junior Andre Hutson, they
have given Michigan State a less-heralded Fab Five of their own.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys were incredible, the three seniors,'' says Izzo.
``I don't know how I can make everybody believe how special they
are to me. They've done an incredible job of helping build this
program, and hopefully they'll be great alums and come back and
teach the guys what they did so gallantly tonight, and that was
play with as big a heart and as good an effort as I've ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   A coach can only dream of his team coming up as big as Izzo's
did in a game as big as this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``You talk before a game,'' Izzo says, ``and one of the things
we said was that everybody's got to play tonight.
(itals)Everybody.(unitals) I said, `Each of you, look at each other
and give the other 40 minutes.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Against a great pressing team, Mkchigan State did not turn the
ball over _ even in the halfcourt _ during the first 11 minutes and
55 seconds. The Spartans shot 53 percent in the first half and 60
percent in the second half. They got strategic bench contributions
from freshman Jason Richardson and Duke transfer Mike Chappell, who
may have scored the game's single biggest basket when he nailed a
3-pointer coming out of a timeout emanating from Cleaves's ankle
injury. That basket made it 53-44 and demonstrated to the Gators
just how tough-minded a team this was.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan State won 15 of its last 16, the only loss coming in
overtime at Indiana on a put-back of an air ball at the buzzer. The
Spartans outscored Syracuse, 17-0, to finish off one tournament
game and outscored Iowa State, 20-3, to finish off another. They
knew how to play slow against Wisconsin and how to play fast
against Florida. And they saved their best for last.
</P>
<P>
   That's called having the answer to every question. That's called
being a champion.

AN OLD-FASHIONED CHAMPION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK BLAUDSCHUN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The memories should linger for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Mateen Cleaves limping back on the court, his injured right
ankle heavily taped but his spirit so overwhelming that the entire
RCA Dome could feel it.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves and his coach, Tom Izzo, crying tears of joy as they
stood on the court and watched joyous teammates go through the
ceremonial process of cutting down the nets.
</P>
<P>
   Magic Johnson sitting in the stands watching something unfold
that hadn't happened in 21 years _ a national championship for
Michigan State _ and no doubt flashing back to when he was a
sophomore in college, doing much the same thing that Cleaves and
his teammates were doing.
</P>
<P>
   In the litany of NCAA championship moments, Michigan State's
89-76 win over Florida Monday night should be put near the top. Not
so much for the competitive aspect of the game, which was basically
a blowout in the final 10 minutes, but because of all the drama
surrounding Cleaves and his two senior starting brethren, A.J.
Granger and Morris Peterson, each of whom did more than their share
in securing the title.
</P>
<P>
   The moment was special just for that reason: Michigan State won
a title with three senior starters. And that is something we might
not see again soon.
</P>
<P>
   We live in an era of instant gratification. Of taking the money
and running, sooner rather than later. College basketball has been
affected deeply by that attitude, to the point where it is now an
even-money guess as to whether the best high school seniors even
make it to college.
</P>
<P>
   It is a disturbing trend. Not since 1995, when UCLA beat
Arkansas in a title game that featured three senior starters on
each team, have we seen such a collection of veterans in a title
matchup.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the talent drain has been steady. In 1996,
Kentucky's national championship team lost underclassman Antoine
Walker; after the 1997 game, Kentucky lost Ron Mercer and Arizona
lost Mike Bibby; last year, Connecticut won the national
championship and lost forward Richard Hamilton, while runner-up
Duke lost three underclassmen: Elton Brand, William Avery, and
Corey Maggette.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, Michigan State's veteran team has become the exception
rather than the rule. You could see the progression of the Spartans
over the past four years, from an NIT team, to a Sweet 16 team, to
a Final Four team, to a national champion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's great for the game,'' said a bleary-eyed Izzo at
a press conference. ``I'm not for guys leaving early. But I
understand there are Chris Webbers, Magic Johnsons, and Glenn
Robinsons. Certain players are ready and I would never be against
that if they really are. It's just that so many players leave for
the wrong reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleaves flirted with the idea of leaving after his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mateen could have left,'' said Izzo. ``But I think he needed
to stay. And he knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   Purdue coach Gene Keady said the difference in Monday night's
game was as much experience as talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what you expect to happen with older guys,'' said
Keady. ``If Glenn would have had the same `I want to win a national
championship' attitude, we might have experienced that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keady, like most coaches knows, the reality of the times as they
affect today's players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they have a family that has an education background, it
will probably be a factor,'' he said. ``But I don't think that's
going to change anything. I hope it will. But I don't think so. I
don't think so. I hope five years from now, I can say I was
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   What happens in the next several weeks, when current
underclassmen determine whether they want to return to college, may
determine what team cuts down the nets a year from now when the
Final Four is held in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Already, there is talk that Florida could lose its best player,
sophomore forward Mike Miller. Ohio State could be a strong
contender if guard Michael Redd, its best scorer, decides to
return. Wisconsin, which played the role of underdog in this Final
Four, could do a repeat of Michigan State next season. The Badgers
figure to have four senior starters returning.
</P>
<P>
   But such things would go against the norm, which is why Monday
night's title game was so special.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just Michigan State vs. Florida. It was youth vs.
experience, and experience won.
</P>
<P>
   And so did college basketball.

LIKE HIS SHOT, SUTTON'S AUGUSTA CHANCES ARE LOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ He has an urge to spit it out, as if he had just
taken a bite of a lemon. The taste is bitter, so bitter that words
begin to shape an unthinkable thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be that little wire around the fringe there
where the ball couldn't come down back in the water, but they shave
everything down,'' Hal Sutton said in reference to the par-3 16th
hole at Augusta National. ``They want you to take the risk and
punish you for it. That is what they really want.''
</P>
<P>
   (itals)A player suggesting he doesn't like Augusta National?
Sacrilegious.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   Sutton caught himself. Augusta National, where the Masters
begins Thursday, is a shrine; playing in the tournament is a
privilege. Criticism will get him nowhere, so he shifts focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have a good tournament there,'' he said. ``I have
never played well there.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not an admission of guilt; it is a peace offering to a
golf course that has punished him unmercifully. Thirteen times
Sutton has teed it up in the Masters, and the results are
forgettable: 11 missed cuts, a tie for 27th, and a tie for 31st. He
hasn't played a weekend round at the Masters since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   He is not alone in his misery. Augusta National has taken its
toll on countless professionals over the years, and the reasons
vary. The course, it has been argued, favors those who can hit a
long, high draw off the tee, then shift to a high fade into the
greens. But, others will say, it all comes to how well you chip and
putt.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, a low-ball hitter whose short game has always been
marginal, does not fit into either style. That reality does not
send him down Magnolia Road with visions of green jackets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think everyone is on an equal playing field here,''
said Sutton. ``You don't have to hit a straight ball. It opens the
doors to swing hard and hit it anywhere. They are trying to shut
the door by adding the rough, but that doesn't do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many a player has felt defeated before putting the first peg in
the ground. Sutton is perhaps today's most glaring example, but Lee
Trevino remains Augusta National's most notorious critic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like it, and it doesn't like me,'' is the gist of
Trevino's feelings. His low, cut iron approaches were not well
received by the firm, hard greens, and personal dislike for the
social setting led him to come here with apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Trevino's record, unlike Sutton's, is not one of failure.
He made the cut 17 of 20 times and had two Top 10s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lee pretty much was the exception,'' said Jay Haas, who will
be playing in his 19th Masters. ``A guy who had pretty much done
everything in golf. But for some reason he just got it in his head
that he could not play there comfortably. I disagree with that, and
I think as he looked back on it, he's kicking himself that he
didn't (give it a chance).''
</P>
<P>
   Sutton does not want to look back with regret. He is a few weeks
shy of his 42d birthday, and after some turmoil in his personal
life and a period of self-doubt with his golf game, his career has
been rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am appreciative of the opportunity to get back my golf
game,'' said Sutton.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters, he said, is the ultimate test for him. More of a
challenge, perhaps, than beating Tiger Woods head-to-head two weeks
ago in The Players Championship. More of a challenge, certainly,
than the PGA Championship victory in 1983. Because now, the mind is
the opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart Appleby can relate to Sutton's woes at Augusta. And to
Jeff Maggert's. And to Paul Azinger's. And to Bob Tway's. And to
Lee Janzen's. And to those of so many others who concede that they
have let the course get to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Definitely, there is a mental hump here,'' said Appleby, who
has missed the cut twice in three Masters starts. ``It's not that
the holes are shaped differently, but there's a mental barrier.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to get over the Augusta aura and just play the
course. Players try to read the greens too much, try to win the
golf tournament, and when your nerves shut down, everything else
shuts down.''
</P>
<P>
   All of them, at one time or another, have hit a shot at the pin,
only to have it roll 40-50 feet away. All of them, at one time or
another, have stood over a shot with no idea how to get at a pin.
All of them, at one time or another, have felt cursed by the genius
of Alister Mackenzie.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Burke Jr.'s advice to all of them: ``If you've got some
sort of animosity, don't go. If you want to go, change your shoes
in the parking lot and go to the first tee. Leave all the other
stuff alone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 1956 Masters champion said too many players go to Augusta
with 14 clubs and twice as many excuses as to why they can't play
the course.
</P>
<P>
   Azinger, for instance, heard so many times that his low
trajectory did not fit in at Augusta, he started to believe it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I found out a couple of years ago that wasn't the case,''
said Azinger. ``I only lost by three shots and didn't even putt
particularly well. I could easily have found three shots out there
on the greens.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 indifferent appearances, Azinger said, a different
frame of mind gripped him: ``My expectations probably are just a
little higher than they might have been.''
</P>
<P>
   Not in the atmosphere of Sutton's, however. The TPC victory _
during a week in which he constantly said he would not back down
from Woods _ has filled his tank with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a player, you are going to like the ones you play well on
and you don't like the ones you don't play well on,'' said Sutton.
``(Augusta National) hasn't been one of my favorites. But the
challenge for me to play well is still there.''
</P>
<P>
   And Sutton, we were reminded two weeks ago, puts his arms around
a challenge with a firm grip.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I see is a competitive Hal Sutton,'' said his longtime
caddie, Freddie Burns. ``He wants to compete. He just doesn't want
to play at the Masters. He wants to compete at the Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's going there to win the golf tournament.''

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A couple thousand years after Greece supplied a name for the
continent, Europe is about to return the favor.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, when the euro likely replaces the Greek drachma, the
European Central Bank and its official interest-rate policy will
effectively rule the Greek economy, ending a history of inflation
and financial chaos.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign lenders will sleep more soundly knowing they will be
repaid in euros, rather than drachmas. And Greek companies, which
used to pay double-digit interest rates on loans _ ten years ago,
Greece's inflation rate soared to 24 percent _ will soon be able to
borrow at lower rates than U.S. firms.
</P>
<P>
   Standard &AMP; Poor's recently hiked Greece's credit rating two
rungs, to A-. The benefits have already shown up in the Athens
stock index, which rose fourfold between January 1997 and January
2000.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, most Europeans opposed Greece's entry into the
European Monetary Union. If a volatile Greece joined EMU, the fear
was a Trojan Horse of economic woes might sneak inside Euroland:
exploding debt, rampant inflation, and widening deficits. Countries
such as Germany and France might get stuck bailing out Greece
during its next budget crisis.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past year, Greece has allayed these worries by
successfully fighting fiscal and monetary excess. The budget
deficit has been reduced from 15 percent of gross domestic product
in 1990 to about 1.5 percent; inflation has fallen from 20 percent
to 2.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Greece has also jumped on the privatization bandwagon, selling
stakes in the National Bank of Greece and in the Hellenic
Telecommunications Organization, the biggest telephone firm.
</P>
<P>
   These sales raked in millions of dollars and helped push down
the national debt.
</P>
<P>
   This year looks like another good one, with GDP rising to 3.5
percent, higher than most of Europe. That's a good thing for the
ruling Panhellenic Socialist Party (PASOK), for it must hold an
election this year.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Greeks have become accustomed to a raging stock
market, PASOK is waiting for stock prices to rebound from a slump
in late 1999.
</P>
<P>
   According to Greek newspapers, the benchmark stock index must
return to the lofty 6000 level before PASOK will hold general
elections. (The index peaked at 6188 in September 1999 and sat
around 5100 in mid-January.)
</P>
<P>
   Without a guard as vigilant as the Securities and Exchange
Commission, you can't rule out some stock manipulation to get
prices up to the target. It's a dangerous game, but PASOK might
find it's more dangerous to lose the election.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether the party pulls off a victory or not, Greece will
join the EMU, since the opposition New Democracy Party also
supports entry.
</P>
<P>
   You can almost hear the good wishes of other countries that want
to follow the Greek lead. The Czechs, Hungarians, and Poles all
imagine themselves carrying euros in the next five years. Even
Turkey sees itself joining the EMU.
</P>
<P>
   Could Greece ever abide this? Yes, because in order to
demonstrate the good behavior required for its own membership,
Greece had to act the better neighbor. So in December the
government, led by Costas Simitis, officially accepted Turkey as a
``candidate'' for the European Union.
</P>
<P>
   With EMU entry no longer a pipe dream for Turkey and the like,
speculators may begin snapping up ``emerging Europe'' equities with
as much enthusiasm as they've done with those in Greece.
</P>
<P>
   To keep the cheers going, remember that Athens will host the
2004 Olympics. That will bring plenty of tourists and foreign
currency. Even if Greece wins no relay races or wrestling matches,
she will be a big winner in the spectacle. &QL;

&HT;     A MAGIC TOUCH CAN _ PRESTO _ HELP YOUR CAREER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Which is more important: making a hard job look
easy or an easy job look hard? The answer, of course, is ``yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Society loves people who make a hard job look easy, with the
grace of a Magic Johnson or the dexterity of a classic chef or the
poise of an Oprah Winfrey. Nowhere on a bestseller list will you
find ``How to be a Millionaire by Scrimping and Saving and Busting
Your Hump for 40 Years.''
</P>
<P>
   But we also love magic tricks. Deep down, you know that nobody
really makes an elephant disappear, but you appreciate the
illusion. Certainly there is hard work involved, but nowhere near
as much as if you REALLY made an elephant disappear (which would
probably involve dynamite and a whole lotta Dustbusters).
</P>
<P>
   If you want to succeed, take advantage of both illusions. If you
don't have any magic, your career won't, either.
</P>
<P>
   To make hard work look easy and easy work look hard, you need a
sense of timing. Saying all the right words won't matter if your
timing is off.
</P>
<P>
   Take complaining. Unless you have an ideal job, there will be
times you could _ and should _ complain to your boss. But you
usually shouldn't do it when you're angry or upset about something
unrelated to work, or if you don't have any constructive way to
solve the problem. No matter what you say, your timing will be way
off.
</P>
<P>
   If conditions are miserable for everyone at your company and for
some reason you can't unionize or complain to the boss as a group,
griping by yourself probably won't do any good, either. Unless your
boss is a complete idiot, he already knows conditions are
miserable, and he can't or won't do anything about it. Put up with
it or leave.
</P>
<P>
   And if your high-pressure situation is temporary, that's the
absolute worst time to complain. With apologies to Rudyard Kipling,
if you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and
blaming it on you, your boss will love you for it. And so will your
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   When everyone is scrambling to make a deadline or panicking
about all the glitches in the new computer system, that's the time
to make the hard job look easy. Be a cross between Joe Montana and
Mary Poppins: calm, confident and compassionate. If you can, be
ahead of the pack and help the stragglers along.
</P>
<P>
   If there's a high-profile change going on, the company has
already decided that the worker strain is a small price to pay for
the long-term gain, so complaining wouldn't help you in any case.
What do you think the boss is going to say? ``Gee, Mary's feeling
stressed, so let's cancel this $100,000 project?'' ``John hates the
new phone system, so we're going back to two tin cans and a
string?''
</P>
<P>
   So when exactly is the best time to complain? When things are
going wonderfully. But instead of making it into a complaint,
consider it more like sculpting your job.
</P>
<P>
   See if there are important jobs that no one else is doing, then
offer to do them. Look at ways to streamline your current job with
things like computer shortcuts, fewer meetings and a better filing
system. Consider whether you're being too much of a perfectionist
on inconsequential things. Think about how you can do your job just
as well or better in less time. Brainstorm.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever you do, don't look as if you have nothing to do. Quiet
times are like hunting season for bosses, when they look to hand
out jobs that are hardly exciting, but have to be done. Those
temporary assignments have a way of turning permanent. If you make
your easy job look hard, they won't pick you for a lot of those
dead-end assignments.
</P>
<P>
   This might sound like laziness, but it's really not. It's a
business strategy. Honest.
</P>
<P>
   Think of a company like Intel. If Intel wanted its profits to
soar temporarily, it could do it very easily; just stop spending
any money on research and development. Its revenue would stay close
to the same for a quarter or two, but expenses would drop. That
means more profit.
</P>
<P>
   Sooner or later, though, Intel would get clobbered. Because it
didn't spend any money on R&AMP;D, it wouldn't have anything fresh to
offer.
</P>
<P>
   That is what workaholics and people who are constantly
scrambling in their jobs don't understand. They're not investing
anything in career R&AMP;D, and eventually they're going to lose. If
you're treading water in a place where the waves never stop,
someday you will drown.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly there are jobs where you are expected to scramble all
the time, particularly in high-tech. But plan for some time that
you can devote to R&AMP;D, even if it's taking a sabbatical three years
from now. Many people wait until it's too late, then feel
constantly overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to your career, the greatest trick of all is
making sure it doesn't disappear.
</P>

SINFUL SOUPS FROM PAPPADEAUX AND COMMANDER'S PALACE

   A reader writes looking for the recipe for shrimp gumbo similar
to that served at Pappadeaux restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   In my search, I keyed into www.CopyKat.com, a recipe site based
in Houston. There wasn't a recipe for Pappadeaux's gumbo, but there
was one from Pappadeaux for its sinful crawfish bisque. There was
also a recipe for the seafood gumbo from New Orleans' landmark
Commander's Palace. So, here are two recipes for the price of one
stamp.

   AIDS-DRUG (Paris) _ The World Health Organization and UN Aids
have recommended the use of a common and affordable antibiotic for
the 23 million people infected with the AIDS virus in Africa. If
preliminary tests are borne out and the drug _ which can cost as

   DRUG-PRICES (Washington) _ The political potency of high prices
for prescription drugs is powerfully demonstrated on two fronts
Wednesday. Slade Gorton of Washington, a mainstream Republican
senator, is complaining about the disparity between prescription
drugs in Canada and the United States. Although Democrats have been
making this point for months, the drug lobby is in a panic now that
Republicans are adding a voice to the criticism. And in the Senate,

<P>
   VT-SUPREME-COURT (Concord, N.H.) _ The divorce case of a state
Supreme Court justice has taken the lid off questionable practices
in the court, leading to what some say is a constitutional crisis.
On Wednesday the state attorney general released a report detailing
his investigation into the court's practice of allowing judges who
has recused themselves from cases to comment on them. The
disclosures have prompted moves in the legislature to impeach all
five justices and the justice getting the divorce has already
resigned in a deal to avoid charges for trying to influence the
divorce case. By Carey Goldberg.

investigation has been managed so far.

   &UR; SCIENCE &LR;  (``a'' code)
</P>
<P>
   SCI-DRUG-ACCESS (Undated) _ Cancer patients and others with
severe pain who live in nonwhite neighborhoods may have trouble
getting treatment for their pain, because local pharmacies often
refuse to stock morphine and related drugs, doctors are reporting.
A survey of 347 pharmacies in New York City found that in nonwhite
neighborhoods, only 25 percent of pharmacies had enough
morphine-like drugs, known as opioids, to treat severe pain. But in
white neighborhoods, 72 percent of the stores had adequate
supplies. Doctors say that the problem, which they say is not
limited to New York, fits into a disturbing nationwide pattern,
revealed by recent studies showing that blacks are less likely than
whites to be referred for kidney transplants or surgery for
early-stage cancers, or to be given painkillers for broken bones or
pain follwing surgery. By Denise Grady.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-BIOTECH-FOOD (Undated) _ Amid growing concerns over possible
risks posed by genetically modified crops, the National Academy of
Sciences issued a report Wednesday that calls for stronger
regulation of the novel plants and points to the potential for food
safety risks and environmental hazards. While noting the potential
for problems, the report emphasized that there was no evidence that
any biotech food currently on the market is unsafe to eat. By Carol
Kaesuk Yoon and Melody Petersen.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-HORMONE-REACT (Undated) _ Doctors officers were beseiged
with calls Wednesday from women and their husbands, wondering if
they should stop taking estrogen, following latest news that shows
it might slightly increase heart attack risk, rather than lower it.
But while many doctors pushed the concept, there has never been any
real evidence that estrogen was good for the heart. Still, the
situation has left women confused again. By Gina Kolata.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-OZONE-DEPLETE (Undated) _ Researchers from NASA and other
agencies said Wednesday that they have recorded one of the worst
losses of stratospheric ozone in the Arctic, coming near the end of
one of the coldest winters on record in the polar stratosphere. The
finding heightens concern that changes in the global climate may
delay recovery of the earth's partly depleted ozone layer. By

<P>
   Wouldn't it be a kick in the head if this feud between Elian
Gonzalez's relatives in Miami and the kid's father in Cuba turned
out to be a hoax?
</P>
<P>
   It's far-fetched, sure, but not that far-fetched. What if the
dad, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, and the Florida relatives were actually
on the same side in the dispute about the boy's residency? What if
the name-calling, the threats, the recrimination were part of a
secret plan to help Elian's father defect to the United States?
</P>
<P>
   We'll find out soon enough. According to news reports, Juan
Miguel Gonzalez could be arriving in the United States any minute
now.
</P>
<P>
   There has been no indication whatsoever that he intends to do
anything but assert his rightful custody of Elian and take him home
to Cuba as soon as possible. But once the elder Gonzalez is given
the opportunity to stand on America's ``free soil,'' as Al Gore put
it the other day, who's to say that he won't seize the moment and
request permanent residency for himself and his son?
</P>
<P>
   It's true that Gonzalez has been toeing the party _ read that
``Communist Party'' _ line in demanding the return of Elian to his
native Cuba. But what else could he do? He's hardly in a position
to say to Fidel Castro:
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey, Fidel, life's a ball here on your island. As suffocating
dictatorships go, it's a great place to visit. But it ain't Miami,
if you know what I mean, so I think I'll just catch the next plane
to Florida, hook up with my kid and start talking about my life in
Cuba strictly in the past tense.''
</P>
<P>
   Do you suppose Castro allows political prisoners to receive mail
from their children who live in the U.S.?
</P>
<P>
   Given the impracticality of speaking his mind, perhaps Gonzalez
conjured up this plot to prove his loyalty to Castro by fostering
the illusion that he is at odds with his Miami relatives about
Elian's future _ and that he could absolutely be trusted to travel
to America and return promptly with his son.
</P>
<P>
   It's wishful thinking, I know.
</P>
<P>
   OK, it's not any kind of thinking. It's a flight of fancy. But
I'll bet it's not the most preposterous conspiracy theory you've
heard this year _ or this week, for that matter.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever. Until advised otherwise, we must assume that Juan
Miguel Gonzalez means exactly what he says: He wants to regain
custody of his son and take him home to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   As much as freedom-loving Americans might abhor the idea of
condemning an adorable 6-year-old to a life of relentless
oppression in Cuba, there's no getting around the reality that
Elian and his father are residents of that country _ and if that's
where the father wants his son to grow up, we have no right to
interfere.
</P>
<P>
   American politicians, especially, ought to butt out.
Presidential candidates in both parties have tried to exploit this
controversy, as have elected officials from coast to coast. It's
hardly surprising to see a Marxist thug such as Castro using an
innocent child for propaganda purposes, but we expect better from
those who call themselves leaders of the greatest nation on the
planet.
</P>
<P>
   As for those Cuban-American militants in Miami _ the ones who
threatened to form a human chain around Elian to prevent officials
from returning him to his father _ well, they say they care about
Elian, but it is perfectly obvious that what they really care about
is baiting Castro. If they had the kid's interests at heart, they
would be urging his relatives in Miami to reunite him with his
father.
</P>
<P>
   That this dispute has gone on for so long _ the boy was pulled
out of the ocean on Thanksgiving Day, for crying out loud _ is a
national disgrace. Elian should have been sent home to his father
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of people to blame, but the time for
blame-finding is past. The time has arrived to repair this mess. If
Juan Miguel Gonzalez arrives in America and says he wants to take
his son home to Cuba, he should be allowed to do so without further
delay.
</P>
<P>
   If he wants to stay, of course, then surely that can be
arranged.

   FAKE-GARDENS (New York) _ For the $6.2 billion artificial, dried

mainstay of hotels, offices, malls and atriums because they don't

   PHILLY-PRESERVATION (Philadelphia) _ If hype was an art form,

destinations, then Mr. Goldman would surely be on the short list.
Most real estate mavens do not mess with losing propositions but

&HT;     `OLD ECONOMY,' REAL MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The heck with ``the old economy'' and ``the new
economy.'' I want a piece of the Willie economy.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown, the mayor of San Francisco, jumped with both
well-shod feet into the stock market last year and made a killing,
largely on initial offerings of high-tech stocks, doubling his
investment to almost $1 million.
</P>
<P>
   According to his spokeswoman, Kandace Bender, the mayor doesn't
have a new financial adviser but is ``kind of playing around on the
Internet and doing trading over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   Willie Brown, a day trader? Why not? The man does have a short
attention span and loves quick turnarounds.
</P>
<P>
   Most of his purchases took place during last year's election. So
that's what he was doing behind the podium during debates _ buying
and selling on his laptop.
</P>
<P>
   Brown is a political genius, so why not a market genius, too?
And it's conceivable he knows how to use a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor is a Democrat, despite his Republican tastes and
endorsements. He should share his wealth of knowledge with
residents. How about installing a ticker in the City Hall rotunda
to show all his purchases and their prices?
</P>
<P>
   I'd be in the rotunda with my laptop, following every move of
San Francisco's mayor and leading economic indicator. If only I
could get in on the ground floor _ or better, the second floor of
City Hall _ with those IPOs.
</P>
<P>
   The only two ``old economy'' stocks in the mayor's portfolio are
a good example of what's wrong with trying to divide the economy
into old and new sectors.
</P>
<P>
   One is UPS and the other is Mirage Resorts. The former delivers
stuff sold by e-commerce companies and the latter is in the
gambling business, like Nasdaq. The old economy and the new economy
have a way of running together into what you might call ``the
economy.''
</P>
<P>
   I ran into an old acquaintance, Howard Slater, in the lobby of
the Charles Schwab brokerage (where 15 newspeople were interviewing
three investors about market disturbances) and he explained the
difference between the old and the new economy in the most sensible
of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old economy is the companies we grew up with, like GM and
Clorox, the companies that actually make things and show a profit
at the end of the year,'' Slater said. ``The new economy is
companies like 3Com and Palm where you're betting on future
value.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, anytime you invest in a company you're
betting on future value and hoping it makes money at the end of the
year.
</P>
<P>
   That's even the case with Amazon.com, which hasn't made a profit
in its six years in business, and whose founder, Jeff Bezos, says
he won't make predictions about profitability.
</P>
<P>
   After all, predicting a profit for Amazon.com could destroy
investor confidence and bring down the house of cards.
</P>
<P>
   Dividing companies into new and old economies doesn't make a lot
of sense to me. Microsoft is one of the engines of the
information-based economy, yet it ships products and makes a
profit.
</P>
<P>
   Old-line companies in which my family owns stock, like
Pittsburgh Plate Glass and Bristol-Myers, use high-tech processes
to make glass and drugs. It's not as if workers are individually
hand-blowing car windows, or mixing aspirin with ladles.
</P>
<P>
   New information systems have been integrated with steel
machinery, leading to the great productivity of the American
economy, so where do you draw the line between new and old?
</P>
<P>
   ``Old economy'' vs. ``new economy'' seems more like a cultural
distinction, a fashion distinction or a form of invective. Your
employees drink Pabst, ours drink microbrews. Your managers wear
suits and ties, ours wear bowling shirts.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever is going on in the Dow Jones and Nasdaq, or new and old
economy, something seems to be shaking out. At least we're all
getting ready for a big shakeout.
</P>
<P>
   A Silicon Valley tech expert was quoted on the front page of the
Wall Street Journal the other day as saying that for five years
people in the valley haven't been selling products, they've been
selling stocks.
</P>
<P>
   A stockbroker was quoted on television as saying that the stocks
taking the big hits were ones for companies that had no revenues,
and would have no revenues in the foreseeable future.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, there's the real economy and the unreal economy.
</P>

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   I don't care if Willie Brown himself advises investing in the
following companies. These are the ones I won't touch:
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything that involves people buying pet food, CDs or
groceries over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything in which truck drivers have to be offered stock
options so they'll deliver the pet food, CDs or groceries while
their trucks are collecting double-parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything that involves an on-line magazine, particularly if it
promises to be cutting edge and have media critics.
</P>
<P>
   _ Anything that needs a venture capitalist.
</P>
<P>
   Call me an old economy snob, but give me an old-fashioned
capitalist anytime. Or give me WillieBrown.com.

   WASHINGTON _ The ``Spirit of Seattle'' serves as a source of
pride for the tens of thousands of protestors descending upon
Washington this week, but to police officials here it evokes images
of chaos and a breakdown of order.
</P>
<P>
   As demonstrators stream into this already crowded capital city
to protest everything from free trade with China to global poverty
at the spring meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World
Bank, Washington D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey is determined to
prevent a re-occurrence of the violence that derailed the World
Trade Organization summit in Seattle last fall.
</P>
<P>
   Downtown Washington, Ramsey promises, will not turn into another
``Battle in Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   He promises that security will be tight throughout the city,
anchored by 1,500 police officers.
</P>
<P>
   They will be working closely with up to 500 additional officers
from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and U.S. Capitol Police,
Park Police and Secret Service, Ramsey said.
</P>
<P>
   The largest role, and thus the largest burden for containing the
upcoming demonstrations falls to Ramsey's district police. And,
having witnessed the Seattle protests _ shut down the WTO meetings,
tarnish the city's reputation and force the ``retirements'' of its
two top police officials _ district police are confident they can
control what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, local law enforcement intends to back up such tough
talk. (Ramsey himself attended an FBI seminar on lessons learned
from the Seattle protests.) But the anti-globalization protesters
that have been salivating at the prospect of these spring meetings
_ which typically garner no more than two dozen hard-core activists
_ appear equally determined.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of their Seattle success, these protesters have
targeted the IMF and World Bank as institutions they claim serve
corporate ``big business'' interests while impoverishing ordinary
citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will demonstrate that the IMF and World Bank have not
alleviated global poverty; instead they have exacerbated it,'' said
Kevin Danaher, one of the protest organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters want to reduce the role of the IMF and World Bank
in countries' domestic financial affairs. Uniting under an umbrella
organization called Mobilization for Global Justice, the
protesters' stated goal is to ``shut down the spring meetings,
entirely.''
</P>
<P>
   To achieve this goal, protest leaders have vowed to follow a
policy of civil disobedience, including marches and human chains
around the IMF and World Bank buildings _ only two blocks west of
the White House. These tactics were effective in the Seattle
protests, where demonstrators were able to trap finance and trade
ministers in their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ramsey acknowledged that the protesters have a right to
peacefully demonstrate, he emphasized that ``the ministers also
have a right to have their meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the demonstrations will remain peaceful,'' the chief
said, hastening to add that the department has trained extensively
to deal with any outbreaks of violence. For example, officers are
learning riot-control tactics and watching videos of the Seattle
police losing control.
</P>
<P>
   The district police department has made sure its officers will
be well-equipped. If necessary, riot gear, tear gas, gas masks and
rubber bullets will be readily available for officers at the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   While the police department has kept many of its security plans
confidential, Ramsey has made it clear that his officers will not
allow violence or non-compliance with police orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow people to freely roam our streets and engage
in violence,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, spokespersons for the Mobilization for Global Justice
have said repeatedly that their demonstrations will remain
peaceful. They admit, however, that it is difficult to control
radical protestors. The instances of rampant violence and vandalism
during the four-day WTO summit, for example, resulted mainly from
radical fringe groups not directly associated with organized
protest demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in Seattle drew heavy criticism for not being
prepared for the possibility of violent demonstrations. So much so,
that the city's police chief and his deputy chose to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey does not want that scenario repeated. So his department
began security preparations early, beginning with the chief's
attendance at the FBI seminar on Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he learned during the session, Ramsey replied,
``that these groups will resort to acts of violence to achieve
their goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The protestors have threatened to block Metro stations and/or
traffic on downtown Washington streets during the spring meetings.
Similar tactics succeeded in shutting down a portion of Seattle
during the WTO summit.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a proactive approach, Ramsey aims to smother any violence
early, before it has the chance to get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many of the planned demonstrations will be on
national park grounds under the jurisdiction of the Park Police,
and requiring groups to have permits.
</P>
<P>
   Park Police spokesman Robert McLain said so far, protestors have
obtained permits for official demonstrations on Sun., April 16, in
Lafayette Park and on the Ellipse _ in front of and behind the
White House, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the protests remain peaceful, McLain noted that the
Park Police will allow the demonstrations to proceed. Should
protesters assemble without a permit, however, they would first be
asked to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   If they refuse, McLain added, ``They would be subject to
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ramsey said he hopes that no arrests will be necessary,
the protestors ``are the ones responsible for their behavior and
for demonstrating peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he anticipated a Seattle-like shutdown of downtown
Washington, Ramsey replied emphatically, ``Absolutely not.''

ministers in their hotels.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ramsey acknowledged that the protesters have a right to
peacefully demonstrate, he emphasized that ``the ministers also
have a right to have their meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully the demonstrations will remain peaceful,'' the chief
said, hastening to add that the department has trained extensively
to deal with any outbreaks of violence. For example, officers are
learning riot-control tactics and watching videos of the Seattle
police losing control.
</P>
<P>
   The district police department has made sure its officers will
be well-equipped. If necessary, riot gear, tear gas, gas masks and
rubber bullets will be readily available for officers at the
protests.
</P>
<P>
   While the police department has kept many of its security plans
confidential, Ramsey has made it clear that his officers will not
allow violence or non-compliance with police orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will not allow people to freely roam our streets and engage
in violence,'' he warned.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, spokespersons for the Mobilization for Global Justice
have said repeatedly that their demonstrations will remain
peaceful. They admit, however, that it is difficult to control
radical protestors. The instances of rampant violence and vandalism
during the four-day WTO summit, for example, resulted mainly from
radical fringe groups not directly associated with organized
protest demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials in Seattle drew heavy criticism for not being
prepared for the possibility of violent demonstrations. So much so,
that the city's police chief and his deputy chose to retire.
</P>
<P>
   Ramsey does not want that scenario repeated. So his department
began security preparations early, beginning with the chief's
attendance at the FBI seminar on Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what he learned during the session, Ramsey replied,
``that these groups will resort to acts of violence to achieve
their goals.''
</P>
<P>
   The protestors have threatened to block Metro stations and/or
traffic on downtown Washington streets during the spring meetings.
Similar tactics succeeded in shutting down a portion of Seattle
during the WTO summit.
</P>
<P>
   Taking a proactive approach, Ramsey aims to smother any violence
early, before it has the chance to get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   For example, many of the planned demonstrations will be on
national park grounds under the jurisdiction of the Park Police,
and requiring groups to have permits.
</P>
<P>
   Park Police spokesman Robert McLain said so far, protestors have
obtained permits for official demonstrations on Sun., April 16, in
Lafayette Park and on the Ellipse _ in front of and behind the
White House, respectively.
</P>
<P>
   As long as the protests remain peaceful, McLain noted that the
Park Police will allow the demonstrations to proceed. Should
protesters assemble without a permit, however, they would first be
asked to disperse.
</P>
<P>
   If they refuse, McLain added, ``They would be subject to
arrest.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ramsey said he hopes that no arrests will be necessary,
the protestors ``are the ones responsible for their behavior and
for demonstrating peacefully.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he anticipated a Seattle-like shutdown of downtown
Washington, Ramsey replied emphatically, ``Absolutely not.''

   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It's not often that a member of Augusta National
holds a press conference in his green jacket, but let's cut Arnold
Palmer some slack _ he is new at this.
</P>
<P>
   Not new at the green jacket (he has won four) and not new at
press conferences (he has had umpteen zillion), just new to paying
dues. The members invited him to join last fall, and he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now if they'd just let me play this thing from the members'
tees,'' joked Palmer, who is 70.
</P>
<P>
   Though the long ball has left him, he can still remember when,
and Tuesday he had no problem listing a host of Masters highlights
over the years.
</P>
<P>
   One of them was coming here for the first time with his wife,
Winnie, and sleeping in their camper. Someone asked if that memory
had sparked any emotion as he came to Augusta this year without
Winnie, who died of cancer last fall. Palmer couldn't answer; tears
welled up in his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   There'll be more nostalgia for him Thursday and Friday, no
doubt, but he will be among friends. The committee grouped him with
Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're familiar faces,'' said Palmer, who was clearly
pleased. ``I've seen 'em before.''

   Virtually no one would whine about such things, this being an

even smiled about the so-called Tiger-proofing, which he seems to
think is backfiring.

 &HT;    AFTER 135 YEARS, IT'S TIME TO FURL THE CONFEDERATE FLAG
 &HT;    For Sunday, April 9
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox Newspapers
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ On April 9, 1865, Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee
rose from surrendering his forces at the crossroads of Appomattox
Courthouse, and found himself looking into the eyes of Ely Parker.
</P>
<P>
   Military Secretary to U.S. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Parker was a
Seneca Indian, readily distinguished as such by his dark features
and strong cheekbones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad to see one real American here,'' Lee said, as he
shook Parker's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all Americans,'' came Parkdr's poignant reply.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred and thirty five years after the collapse of tje
Confederacy, the symbol of the Confederate cause still has the
power to challenge the force and reason behind Parker's unrehearsed
eloquence. Much of the American South, after all, remains split
over whether to revere the Confederate battle flag and sanction it
with enduring institutional status, or to consign it, as Lee did at
Appomattox, to its rightful place in history.
</P>
<P>
   In an age when thousands of American soldiers are standing
sentry against age old regional and ethnic hatreds in Bosnia and
Kosovo, when an uncertain world looks to the United States to try
to broker peace between Arab and Jew in the fractious Middle East,
when the export of American democracy has fueled a global
revolution that has brought tyrants low and unleashed millions from
their yoke, parts of the American South remain incongruously out of
step with the nation's larger purpose, as haunted by history as any
place on Earth.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps nowhere do the ghosts of the South's rebellious past
linger with more insistence than in Richmond, Va. Growing up there
in the 1950s and 60s, I never forgot that my hometown was the
once-proud capital of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
   Historical markers and battlefields peppered the local
landscape, and hallowed ground lay everywhere around a city that
spent most of the Civil War under siege.
</P>
<P>
   I rode my bike in the shadows of massive stone monuments to
J.E.B. Stuart, Stonewall Jackson, Jefferson Davis and Lee. I caught
catfish in the muddy waters of the James River, which guarded the
city like a grand serpentine moat from Union advances in the early
months of the war.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Douglas Southall Freeman High School, named for Lee's
celebrated biographer. Our official school name was ``The Rebels;''
our banner the Confederate battle flag. The band played ``Dixie''
at pep rallies and third and long. And we'd gird ourselves for
torturous football drills in the sweltering heat of August by
reminding each other of the necessity to show, at all times,
something we called ``Rebel Pride.''
</P>
<P>
   That's far from what comes to mind today when I watch as a
handful of southern states _ Virginia is not among them _ cling
stubbornly to the Confederate flag as some final, vainglorious
vestige of a long lost, and fatally flawed, cause.
</P>
<P>
   For what that flag symbolizes to so many Americans is national
trauma and human despair, not only at the horror of the past it
exhumes, but at the notion that the hatred and injustice that split
this nation asunder a century and a half ago refuses, for some, to
surrender or die.
</P>
<P>
   I understand, even partly embrace, the respect many Southerners
still hold for that flag and those who served it.
</P>
<P>
   For if slavery was the irredeemable evil burning at the core of
the Confederate revolt, it's also true that scores of thousands of
Southerners who never owned a slave, nor wanted to, took up arms to
defend a way of life, a culture that valued family and farm. They
resented the imposition of Washington's will and found financial
security and personal worth within a largely feudal structure
sharply at odds with the industrialist patterns that shaped the
North.
</P>
<P>
   Over those ideals, blood was shed. Good men died, a nation's
fate was cast.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, it does no service to the remembrance of those lives to
perpetuate the pain so many died to put to rest.
</P>
<P>
   When I hear my fellow Southerners defend the continuing use of
the Confederate Flag over the state houses of South Carolina,
Georgia, or Mississippi, I wonder what honor they pay to the memory
of those like General Lee who, in his final command, ordered his
men to return to those states resolved not only to rebuild them,
but to re-knit them back into the fabric of the Union he cherished
above all except his native Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   To Lee, the true heart of Dixie was Community, the idea that
Southern people shared enough common values that they could
reconcile differences deep enough to spark a war, lay down their
swords in its ruinous aftermath, and move purposefully forward,
together as one, into a future lit with renewal and hope.
</P>
<P>
   It is that very future that many Southerners turn their back on
each time they reject the diversity and opportunity of the modern
South, and instead reach into the attic for a dusty totem of an age
Lee buried at Appomattox.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, they not only keep alive the suffering behind one
of the sorriest chapters in American history, they make a mockery
of the sacrifices that brave men, the Blue and the Grey, bore to
make this nation free.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all Americans,'' Ely Parker reminded Lee on the day,
135 years ago, the Confederacy fell. The time has come to furl the
flag.

 CHRON  
 COOKS' BOOKS: Two Jewish Cookbooks Present a Blend of
Tradition  and Innovation   By Karola Saekel  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Holidays the world over, whether religious,
patriotic or personal, are intimately associated with food. The
Thanksgiving turkey, Easter ham, Passover haroset, the dates that
break the fast at Ramadan, or the double chocolate cake Cousin Joe
expects for his birthday are all part of the fabric of those
special days.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And yet, there is a fine line between celebrating tradition and
being in a rut. So a new riff on an old favorite can be welcome,
indeed. Two new books, out in time for Passover, attempt to do that
for Jewish cooking.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite of the two expresses the spirit of old-yet-new even
in its title _ ``The Gefilte Variations: A Food Lover's
Improvisation on Jewish Themes.'' Veteran culinary author Jayne
Cohen has included enough personal notes in this book to create a
warm, fuzzy feeling, yet enough innovations to add new dimensions
without diluting Jewish cooking's essential character.
</P>
<P>
   The second book, ``Mother and Daughter Jewish Cooking: Two
Generations of Jewish Women Share Traditional and Contemporary
Recipes,'' is by the British writer and television host Evelyn Rose
and her daughter, Judi, a New York food writer and television
producer. The premise is intriguing _ mother representing
tradition, daughter pushing the frontiers.
</P>
<P>
   You can certainly create fine meals from this book, though even
Mum, in the name of more healthful eating, makes changes that
traditionalists might not cotton to. ``Grandma's'' kugel, for
example, skips the  &LR; gribenes  &LR; (chicken skin cracklings) and
suggests margarine as an alternative to rendered chicken fat.
</P>
<P>
   Daughter Judi's recipes may be short on tradition but are
simplified (according to Jewish dietary laws) versions of
international favorites. So you get butterflied chicken with
Provencal herbs cooked on the grill, baby potatoes roasted in
herbed olive oil, fluffy Scottish scones and Vienna apple squares
with cinnamon-scented cream. These are delicious dishes, but their
connection to the Jewish kitchen is tenuous.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, American cooks may have a little problem with some
British approaches like corned beef brisket, considered
traditional, cured with saltpeter and served with latkes or french
fries. French fries? It's a very assimilated book.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, on the other hand, reaches back to biblical times with
some of her innovations. A brisket recipe includes pomegranate
molasses _ a historic Middle Eastern sweetener _ as well as
chestnuts, which were also staples in ancient times.
</P>
<P>
   She, too, reaches out to other countries in her recipes, as in
Italian-style fried chicken cutlets that make a delicious entree
during Passover, Romanian-style ground meat sausages, and Egyptian
fish balls. Unlike Judi Rose's international kitchen romp, these
dishes are rooted in regional Jewish cooking.
</P>
<P>
   After all, Jewish cooking may be the original fusion cuisine, as
Jews in the diaspora over centuries have adopted and adapted
ingredients indigenous to the countries they call home.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; ``The Gefilte Variations: A Food Lover's Improvisation on &LR; 
 &LR; Jewish Themes,'' by Jayne Cohen (Scribner, 416 pages hardcover, &LR; 
 &LR; $27.50). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  ``Mother and Daughter Jewish Cooking: Two Generations of &LR; 
 &LR; Jewish Women Share Traditional and Contemporary Recipes,'' by &LR; 
 &LR; Evelyn and Judi Rose (William Morrow, 294 pages hardcover, &LR; 
 &LR; $25). &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; FRIED CHICKEN CUTLETS, ITALIAN-JEWISH STYLE
</P>
<P>
   Jayne Cohen writes that chicken flavored with cinnamon is a
Hanukkah specialty in Italy, but she also recommends this dish for
a nonseder Passover meal. The celery fried with the chicken (but
not eaten), adds flavor and helps make the chicken golden.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon cinnamon
</P>
<P>
   4 large garlic cloves, finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil, plus additional for frying
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   11/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken cutlets, trimmed of fat
and gristle
</P>
<P>
   1 cup fine matzo meal
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   2 to 3 celery stalks, including leaves, washed, dried, cut into
4- to 5-inch lengths
</P>
<P>
   Lemon wedges
</P>
<P>
   Fresh parsley sprigs for garnish (optional)
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   In a large mixing bowl or nonreactive baking dish, whisk
together the cinnamon, garlic, lemon juice, olive oil and salt and
pepper to taste. Add the chicken and toss to coat thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   Set up a work station near the stove. Spread 1 cup matzo meal on
a large sheet of wax paper or a plate and season with 1 teaspoon
salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper or to taste. Next to it, in a wide
shallow bowl or pie pan, beat the eggs with a few drops of water
until well blended and smooth.
</P>
<P>
   Dredge the cutlets well with the matzo meal, rubbing it lightly
into the chicken. Make sure each cutlet is covered all over with
meal. If necessary, add more matzo meal, remembering to add more
seasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Heat about 1/2 cup olive oil in a 10- to 12-inch heavy skillet
over medium heat until hot and fragrant but not smoking. Shake a
cutlet to remove all excess matzo meal, then coat it thoroughly
with the egg and slip it quickly into the hot oil. Being careful
not to crowd the pan, add more chicken, dipping each piece in the
egg just before placing it in the pan. Slip a few pieces of celery
in between the cutlets as they fry. Using 2 spatulas (tongs will
ruin the delicate egg coating), carefully turn the chicken when it
is light golden, 2-3 minutes. Saute the other side 2-3 minutes
longer, or until cooked through. Turn the celery pieces when you
turn the chicken. Transfer the cutlets to a platter lined with
paper towels so they can drain. Discard the cooked celery. Keep the
chicken warm in a 200 degree oven until the remaining pieces are
done.
</P>
<P>
   Continue frying the remaining chicken in batches, in the same
way, adding fresh celery to the pan with each batch. Wipe out the
skillet and replace the oil if some of the coating falls off and
burns.
</P>
<P>
   Serve the chicken right away, accompanied by the lemon wedges
and garnished, if you like, with fresh parsley. It really needs no
sauce.

 &LR; HALIBUT IN A VELVET LEMON SAUCE
</P>
<P>
   This classic Passover dish from Evelyn Rose needs to be
refrigerated at least 24 hours and up to 4 days before serving.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1 large onion, thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons sea salt
</P>
<P>
   Pinch white pepper
</P>
<P>
   11/2 to 2 pounds bone-in halibut, about 6 to 8 pieces (salmon
steaks may be substituted)
</P>
<P>
   The Sauce
</P>
<P>
   2 large eggs
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons fresh lemon juice
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons potato starch, mixed to a cream with the minimum of
water
</P>
<P>
   The Garnish
</P>
<P>
   Curly parsley
</P>
<P>
   Sections of fresh lemon, skin left on
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   In a lidded skillet, large enough to hold all the fish in 1
layer, bring 2 cups water, the onion, sugar, salt and pepper to the
boil. (Adding the sugar at this stage greatly improves the fish
without noticeably sweetening it.) Lower the heat while you prepare
the fish.
</P>
<P>
   Wash and salt the fish and put in the skillet. Bring the
poaching liquid back to the boil, then lower the heat so it is
barely bubbling. Partly cover and simmer very gently for 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Lift out the fish with a slotted spoon or fish slice, draining
any liquid back into the skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Place the fish in an oval serving dish about 11/2 inches deep.
Remove any skin but leave in the bone, then leave to cool while you
make the sauce.
</P>
<P>
   To make the sauce, boil the remaining fish poaching liquid for 3
minutes to concentrate the flavor, then strain it and measure out 1
cupful. Beat the eggs thoroughly with a rotary whisk, then whisk in
the cup of fish liquid, the lemon juice and the potato starch
cream. Alternatively, mix all the sauce ingredients for 10 seconds
in a food processor or blender. This makes it easier to thicken the
sauce without fear of its curdling.
</P>
<P>
   Put this liquid in a thick-bottom saucepan and cook gently over
low heat until the sauce thickens to the consistency of a coating
custard _ you will need to stir it constantly. Do not let it boil
or the eggs may curdle. To make the sauce in the microwave, cook
the blended ingredients, uncovered, in a jug or bowl on 50 percent
power for 2 minutes; whisk well, then cook for a further 2 to 3
minutes, until thickened.
</P>
<P>
   Taste the sauce and add extra lemon juice, if necessary, to make
it equally sweet and sour. Pour the sauce over the fish, coating it
completely. Leave in the refrigerator overnight, covered with
aluminum foil.
</P>
<P>
   Serve at room temperature, garnished with the parsley and lemon
sections.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6 to 8.

U.S. RETURNS STASI FILES TO GERMANY 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By ROGER COHEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN _ After a protracted dispute that had soured German-U.S.
relations, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency has handed over the
first of a large cache of East German files listing intelligence
agents and their code names, the German government said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The files, which will fill critical gaps in Germany's knowledge
of the activities of the old East German intelligence service known
as the Stasi, were spirited out of Berlin in 1989 and are widely
believed to have been acquired by the CIA in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Germany has long demanded the return of the files, saying they
belong in Berlin and should never have been taken to Washington.
But until an accord was reached late last year, the CIA had
insisted the files were too sensitive to be returned.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States handed over the first CD-ROM containing the
files on Friday,'' a spokeswoman for the German government said
Wednesday. ``The government expects to receive further files in the
near future.'' German officials, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said they expected to receive the rest of the files over
the next two years.
</P>
<P>
   After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, the German government
took possession of about 6 million Stasi files, a product of what
was perhaps the most spied-on society in history. The former East
German communist state had 17 million citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Large quantities of these files have already been decoded, but
many contained only the codenames of spies. The set of files
essential to linking these codenames with the real identities of
agents, particularly agents who worked in West Germany, ended up at
CIA headquarters in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   This set of files _ most of which are still in the United States
_ is believed to contain over 300,000 names. That information could
shatter the cover of some former spies still living in Germany,
leading to possible arrests, German officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA has refused to say how it obtained the files.
Unconfirmed reports suggest the files were given by a high-ranking
member of the Stasi to the KGB, the Soviet Union's spy agency, in a
villa in Berlin in 1989. They were then brought to Moscow, where
the CIA later acquired them, reportedly for a large sum.
</P>
<P>
   The German government said Wednesday that the information in the
files delivered by the United States had not yet been examined, but
would be given to the Ministry of the Interior and the commission
overseeing the Stasi files.
</P>
<P>
   By comparing the new files with those it already has, the German
government expects to uncover the names of former West German
employees of the Stasi, who may have numbered as many as 20,000.
</P>
<P>
   The handover of the files may have been a gesture aimed at
patching up a somewhat frayed relationship. German-U.S. relations
have been strained in recent weeks by a fierce dispute over who
should head the International Monetary Fund. The initial German
candidate was rejected by the Clinton administration before Horst
Koehler, also a German, was appointed.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A common issue also lurked behind the arguments over the files
and the IMF: a German perception of growing U.S. arrogance because
the United States is now the only superpower. Many Germans also
believe that America is finding it difficult to adjust to a Germany
that feels free of its historical complexes and ready to flex more
political muscle.
</P>
<P>
   The handover came as Germany debates whether information
gathered by the Stasi on Helmut Kohl should be used to try to
identify the donors who gave money to the former chancellor.
</P>
<P>
   Kohl has insisted that records of telephone conversations with
aides that were tapped by East German spies while he was chancellor
should not be used either in the criminal investigation or
parliamentary inquiry against him. Kohl has admitted breaking the
law by accepting more than $1 million in secret campaign donations,
but has refused to say who gave him the money.

 COOK'S BOOKS: This Is Not Your Nonna's Risotto   By Noel Advincula  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  My love affair with risotto started years ago when
I first tasted it in Italy. Before then, I hadn't really paid much
attention to it. Coming from an Asian background, rice is a staple
that is either steamed or fried. But once I tasted risotto,
characterized by its wonderful blend of Italian rice (Arborio,
vialone or carnaroli) and broth, I became a convert.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Risotto is a classic, straightforward Italian dish that lets the
cook be creative with any number of additions.
</P>
<P>
   Lots of books have been written about risotto, but ``Risotto:
Over 120 Healthy and Delicious ``Little Rice'' Recipes'' is one to
have in the kitchen if you are an adventurer. The cover sets the
tone for the book, with recipes liberally illustrated with
intriguing photos.
</P>
<P>
   The authors, Jenny Stacey and Kathryn Hawkins, begin with basic
cooking techniques and serving suggestions, then launch into
variations, including new ideas for combining the rice and broth.
</P>
<P>
   Recipes like Risotto Rosso, a vibrant red risotto defined by
beets and red wine and served with sour cream and chives, is not
only eye-catching but features exciting juxtapositions of sweet and
sour flavors. It makes an excellent appetizer.
</P>
<P>
   Thai Coconut Risotto _ a fusion East-meets-West dish _ is
another winner because the Asian flavors work so well with the
risotto's texture, proving again just how flexible this ``little
rice'' can be.
</P>
<P>
   However, in stretching risotto's boundaries the authors
occasionally go too far. A dessert Tiramisu Risotto featured
unbalanced flavors _ too much chocolate and not enough sugar _ and
poor consistency. But this lapse is more than made up for by the
other imaginative recipes in the collection.

 WINE POTPOURRI: New Gin Gives Sapphire a Run for Its Money   By Gerald D. Boyd  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Spirits sales have been in a slump for years, even
decades by some estimates. The main reason is the American lighter
diet and healthier lifestyle. An increasing number of people who
used to enjoy a Manhattan or a martini before dinner, switched to
white wine. The only vigor in spirits sales was with white goods,
like gin and vodka, presumably because of their mixability and the
assumption that white spirits were lighter than brown spirits.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most market watchers estimate that flavored vodkas, like Absolut
and Stolichnaya, saved the day for white spirits sales. Americans
love variety and plain old neutral vodka just wasn't satisfying
anymore. Gin, on the other hand, already offered the flavor of
juniper berry, citrus and coriander, although it was precisely that
distinctive perfume and flavor that turned many people off from
gin.
</P>
<P>
   But unlike vodka, gin was available in a number of different
styles, mainly London Dry, Genever and Plymouth. There also were a
few flavored gins, like Malacca from Tanqueray and the French
Citadelle, both variations on the traditional juniper-citrus flavor
profile of most popular gins.
</P>
<P>
   London Dry, the best-known type of gin, is mostly made and
bottled in Britain, although American gins, like Gilbey's and
Burnett's, are made in the London Dry juniper-flavored style.
Genever gins, from Holland, like Bols, Leyden and Van Gough, are
more flavorful than London Dry. Genever gin is made with malted
barley and sometimes aged in barrels before bottling. Plymouth gin,
historically associated with the British Navy and the port of
Plymouth, England, is softer than London Dry, with a sweet
impression in the finish.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, in a bid to satisfy the American market demand
for variety and distinctive flavor, gin distillers worldwide began
adding ultra-premium gins to their lines. Bombay drinkers soon had
Bombay Sapphire to savor. Other upscale gins like Corney&AMP;Barrow,
Boodles, Tanqueray and Daresbury's, entered the market. Now
Tanqueray has a new ultra-premium gin called No. Ten.
</P>
<P>
   Martini lovers swear that a Bombay Sapphire Martini is better by
far than one made with standard Bombay gin. A ``call'' mixed drink
is more expensive than one mixed with gin from the bar well, and
the flavor will be more assertive. Tanqueray, for instance, uses
more citrus in the recipe of No. Ten than in the regular Tanqueray.
</P>
<P>
   For No. Ten, Tanqueray prefers hand-picked whole fresh fruit and
botanicals and small copper pot stills for the distillation. Most
gin, except for some Genever, is made in large continuous stills,
providing a lighter less flavorful spirit than that produced in a
pot still.
</P>
<P>
   Tanqueray No. Ten has a fresh up-front aroma of grapefruit rind,
herbs and sweet spices. The nicely textured flavors are more citrus
with juniper berry back notes and a hint of chamomile and
coriander. Available in 750 ml ($24.99) or one-liter ($30.99)
bottles, Tanqueray No. Ten is packaged in a handsome slender
faceted green bottle with a silver cap and a distinctive red seal.
Next time you're thirsting for a stylish martini, make it with
Tanqueray No. Ten. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   The 2000 grape harvest in Australia will be leaner than
previously expected because of heavy rains and high humidity in the
eastern wine districts. According to the Australian Wine and Brandy
Corporation, floods, unseasonably hot weather, followed by
unseasonably cold weather, are likely to drop wine grape yields
below last year's 1.1 million tons. Officials say, however, that
one bad vintage probably will not affect shipments from the world's
fastest-growing wine exporter. The United States is one of
Australia's largest wine export markets.
</P>
<P>
   As if the heavy rains and flooding weren't enough grief for
Australia's winemakers, locusts hatched in the country's flooded
desert plains, then began spreading through the wine regions of
Southern Australia and parts of New South Wales.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; eBay vs. Lazy Creek &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The online auction house, eBay, has picked up a nice wine item _
Lazy Creek Vineyards in the remote reaches of Mendocino's Anderson
Valley. Lazy Creek owners, Josh and Mary Beth Chandler, told
Winetoday.com they offered 35 percent of the winery on eBay for a
minimum bid of $600,000. The 10-day auction ended March 25, but
Mary Beth Chandler said the online auction didn't produce the
results they wanted. Instead, Chandler said they attracted a
prospective partner through a story that appeared in the Santa Rosa
Press Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hard to Win for Losing &LR;
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago, an item ran in Potpourri about Mendocino's
Greenwood Ridge claiming to have the first wine of 2000. Local wine
consultant Rebecca Chapa alerted me to an article in the British
wine magazine Decanter about Genesis Chardonnay 2000, made by noted
Australian viticulturist, Richard Smart, from a small vineyard in
New South Wales. Smart originally was going to call his Millennium
wine ``First Light,'' but the name already was taken by New Zealand
winemaker Phil Parker for his Firstlight Red. I should have known a
Southern Hemisphere winery would be first with the millennium
claim.
</P>
<P>
   Another message arrived by e-mail from a reader who scolded me
for a statement I made about Chardonnay lacking the inspiration to
encourage the drinker to have a second glass. The reader's
contention is ``since women are bombarded daily by magazines,
papers, radio and TV programs with the warning they should limit
their alcohol intake to no more than one drink a day, the net
effect of your remark was indeed insensitive to your female
readers.''
</P>
<P>
   My reference to having a second glass of wine is a way of saying
the wine is enjoyable, not an encouragement to overindulge. The
Wine Page encourages moderation and the enjoyment of fine wine and
spirits with food. Lighten up, folks.

 BAY AREA CLASSICS: Louis' Serves Up Eggs, Hash Browns and a View 
 on the Side   By Lynne Bennett  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Strolling on Ocean Beach in the bracing salt air
can make you hungry. In the area's heyday, in 1937, you could also
have built up an appetite ice skating at Sutro Baths. Afterwards,
you might have grabbed a hot dog, hamburger or a bowl of chili from
a tiny diner and take-out counter called Louis', just up the hill
from the Cliff House on Point Lobos Avenue.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Now, that 10-stool little eatery has grown to a regular
restaurant with commanding views of Seal Rock and the ruins of
Sutro Baths, but it is still run by the same family that founded
it. Third-generation owners Tom and Bill Hontalas now have a
55-seat restaurant and employ a staff of 20.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1900s, there were several small restaurants on this
stretch of beach, and more than half of them were owned by Greek
immigrants like the Hontalas clan.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Hontalas was 11 years old when he arrived in San Francisco
in 1906 to join an older brother, who was one of those
restaurateurs. By 1937, with a growing family of his own, Louis and
his wife, Helen, started their own restaurant, opening on
Valentine's Day.
</P>
<P>
   They might have been encouraged by a boom in the area's
businesses the previous year when the freighter Ohioan ran aground
just off the point. It took more than a week to raise and salvage
the ship, a spectacle that attracted throngs of sightseers. These
``looky-loos,'' as they were called, were willing to pay nearby
restaurants 50 cents for the usual nickel cup of coffee.
</P>
<P>
   In the next decade, World War II also proved lucrative for beach
businesses, with servicemen comprising a large part of the
clientele. By the late '50s, when the family's second son, Jim, had
taken over, cooking alongside his mother, Helen, the main business
was on weekends and during the summers. But by the mid-'70s, after
the area around Sutro Baths had become part of the Golden Gate
National Recreation Area, year-round sightseeing buses started to
make regular stops at the ruins of the Sutro Baths, which
encouraged the Hontalases to remodel and expand.
</P>
<P>
   Louis' is now a concessionaire of the National Park Service,
just like the nearby Cliff House, owned and operated by distant
cousins of the Hontalases.
</P>
<P>
   Current Louis' operators Tom and Bill Hontalas started working
at the restaurant as youngsters in the '60s. ``We worked for 50
cents an hour washing dishes,'' Tom reminisces. The tradition is
likely to continue since the fourth generation has already started
to help out. Some older family members have been on the staff over
20 years, including Tom's wife, sister and sister-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Louis' is no longer primarily a tourist stop. Locals
provide the base of the business, with 60 percent of sales coming
from breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   While many diners have become increasingly health-conscious,
there are still those regulars who come in and order their four
scrambled eggs and toast. That's still on the menu, as well as the
other egg dishes, sandiwiches, hamburgers, fries and steaks that

 TASTER'S CHOICE: Panel Puts the Bite on Anise Biscotti   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Biscotti _ twice-baked Italian cookies _ used to
be hard to find. Now they're mainstream enough to be on most
grocers' shelves.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today's panel tasted six anise-flavored biscotti, one of the
most popular flavors of the crunchy cookies. They tasted only those
available at supermarkets, not bakeries.
</P>
<P>
   The panel noticed big differences in texture and flavor. Prices
also varied widely, from $2.99 for a 12.4-ounce package to $6.99
for a 10-ounce package.
</P>
<P>
   Top honors went to  &UR; Splendido &LR;  (eight ounces, $6.29 at Whole
Foods), one of the more expensive brands. Three panelists thought
the hard texture of the cookie made it especially good for dunking.
One described the flavor as boring, but others thought it was good
overall. Three would buy it; two might buy it.
</P>
<P>
   Second place went to  &UR; San Anselmo's &LR;  (12.4 ounces, $2.99 at
Andronico's). It was the least costly cookie tasted. The panel
agreed that the anise flavor was too strong, but they loved the
toasty almonds and the crisp texture. Two would buy it; three might
buy it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Safeway Select &LR;  (5.5 ounces, $3.39 at Safeway) came in third.
Two panelists claimed it was good as a cookie, but not very much
like a traditional biscotti. It ``looks and tastes like a
mass-market American version of biscotti,'' one said. Two others
described the flavor as overprocessed and chemical. Two would buy
it, one might buy it, and two would not.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; La Biscotteria &LR;  (10 ounces, $6.99 at Andronico's) came in
fourth. Some panelists appreciated the tender texture, but two felt
it was bready and more like a dry biscuit than a biscotti. Two
thought the flavor was too light, but another described the
flavorings as too strong. One would buy it, one might buy it, and
three would not.
</P>
<P>
   Fifth place went to  &UR; Allegria &LR;  (8 ounces, $5.79 at Andronico's).
The tasters all thought this cookie was much too hard, although
some thought it would be good for dunking in coffee. Three
panelists also disliked the overly sweet flavor. Two might buy it;
three would not.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also tried Pamela's but it scored too low to rate.
</P>
<P>
   Panelists were Flo Braker, cookbook author and Chronicle Food
columnist; John P. Carroll, cookbook author; Donna Katzl,
chef-owner, Cafe For All Seasons, San Francisco; Kim Severson,
Chronicle staff writer; and Kirk Webber, chef-owner, Cafe Kati, San
Francisco. All products are tasted blind. &QL;

EDITORS NOTE: Here's a plan for getting quick meals on the table in
a hurry. Now &AMP; Later is a recipe cooked on the weekend in batches _
enough to serve 12 _ and functions as dinner on the night it's
prepared; freeze the rest for two future meals. The 30-Minute Main
Dish takes a half-hour or less of preparation and Fast &AMP; Fresh
gives you dinner in about 20 minutes. 
 
 THE WORKING COOK: Simple, Soothing Meals Get Spring off to a 
 Great Start   By Tara Duggan  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  When Food Section intern Noel Advincula presented
us with his version of Filipino rice porridge, we were expecting
something like Chinese congee _ a milky white, mildly flavored soup
with a somewhat glutinous consistency.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead, the porridge, which is called  &LR; Arroz Caldo &LR;  or  &LR; Lugaw &LR; 
in the Philippines, featured whole, soft, kernels of rice suspended
in a fragrant golden-yellow broth. Like Chinese congee, the soup is
soothing and warm as it goes down, but generous amounts of ginger,
fish sauce and lemon juice fill it with exotic Southeast Asian
flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Noel remembers eating it as a  &LR; merienda &LR; , or afternoon snack, in
the Philippines and says it also is popular for breakfast. He
recommends it for cool Bay Area evenings.
</P>
<P>
   Another soothing dish is this week's Now &AMP; Later recipe, Chicken
Goulash, a paprika-scented Hungarian stew. Though paprika is a
spice that Americans tend use just for color atop deviled eggs, it
has a distinctive, earthy flavor _ but only if it hasn't been
sitting on the shelf for ages. For dishes like this where the spice
features prominently, it's important to use a fresh box of imported
paprika.
</P>
<P>
   This week's Fast &AMP; Fresh recipe, Flank Steak with Grilled Spring
Onions and Arugula, is a nice way to welcome in the good weather.
If you don't want to take the barbecue out of hibernation, use a
grill pan or just put the steak under the broiler.
</P>
<P>
   The browned onions and warm steak soften the blue cheese and
lightly wilt the arugula, which is dressed in sherry vinegar and
walnut oil. Although green onions work fine, try to seek out spring
onions at a farmers' market or organic food stores. The fresh baby
onions, which look like leeks but with a white or red bulbous end,
have an incredible sweetness that comes out especially when they
are caramelized in a grill pan.
</P>

FAST &AMP; FRESH: dinner in about 20 minutes

<P>
   FLANK STEAK WITH GRILLED SPRING ONIONS &AMP; ARUGULA
</P>
<P>
   This recipe calls for using a grill pan. If you don't have one,
you may use a barbecue grill or your broiler instead.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   1-pound flank steak, in 1 piece
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 spring onions (or 6 green onions)
</P>
<P>
   11/2 bunches arugula
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sherry vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup walnut oil, or extra virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup crumbled blue cheese
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have a grill pan, either prepare a fire in a
barbecue grill or preheat the oven to broil.
</P>
<P>
   Mince the garlic. Rub the steak with the garlic and season
liberally on both sides with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Chop the spring onions on the bias into 1/4-inch pieces. (If
using green onions, slice into 2-inch lengths.)
</P>
<P>
   Trim the arugula and chop roughly in half. Place in a large
salad bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a seasoned grill pan over medium-high heat. Place the steak
in the middle of the pan. Grill for 5 minutes, then turn and grill
another 5 minutes for medium rare.
</P>
<P>
   (If using a broiler, place the steak and onions on an oiled
baking sheet directly under the broiler. Broil for 5 minutes. Turn
once and broil an additional 5 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   While the steak cooks, whisk together the vinegar and mustard;
season with salt and pepper. Whisk in the walnut oil.
</P>
<P>
   When the steak is done, remove it from the heat and let rest at
least 5 minutes. Add the spring onions to the pan and let brown
undisturbed about 1 minute per side. Remove and set aside.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, toss enough of the salad dressing with the arugula to
just coat the leaves; there may be extra dressing. Slice the meat
thinly against the grain into bite-size strips. Portion the arugula
onto serving plates, and fan out the meat slices on top. Garnish
each serving with crumbled blue cheese and the grilled onions.

   3 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Asian fish sauce + more to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 cup long-grain white rice
</P>
<P>
   5 cups chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch saffron (optional)

   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Chop the garlic and the onion. Peel the ginger and slice it into
coins. Cut the chicken into bite-size chunks.
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil in a large heavy pot. Add the garlic, onion and

chicken and saute briefly, about 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Add the fish sauce, rice, broth, pepper and optional saffron and
stir well. Bring to a boil, then add the whole eggs to the pot and

the rice doesn't stick to the bottom of the pot.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the eggs from the pot; set aside. Continue simmering the
porridge until the rice is fully cooked, about 12 minutes longer.
(The porridge should be quite thick, but if you like, thin it with
a little water.) Taste, and add more fish sauce, if desired.
</P>
<P>
   Chop the scallions. Peel the eggs and cut them in half.
</P>
<P>
   To serve, ladle the porridge into serving bowls and top each
with chopped scallions, a hard-cooked egg half and a big squeeze of
lemon juice.

   CHICKEN GOULASH
</P>
<P>
   This goulash calls for sweet paprika, not hot, which gives it a
mild but sweet flavor. If you'd like more of a kick, add a teaspoon
of red pepper flakes with the paprika. Serve over buttered egg
noodles.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   24 chicken drumsticks and thighs
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   4 onions, sliced into rounds
</P>
<P>
   6 garlic cloves, minced
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons high quality sweet paprika
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   6 Roma tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 red bell peppers, deribbed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 green bell peppers, deribbed and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 bunch chives, chopped
</P>
<P>
   Sour cream or creme fraiche
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Season the chicken with salt and pepper. Heat enough oil in a
large heavy pot to cover the bottom of the pot. Brown the chicken
in batches, being careful not to crowd it in the pot. Add more oil
as necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the chicken from the pot and drain off all but 2
tablespoons oil. Add the onions and garlic to the pot and saute
over medium-high heat until browned, about 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Add the paprika and bay leaf. Moisten with a bit of water to
prevent burning and saute for 10 minutes, stirring frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Return the chicken to the pot, then add the tomatoes and bell
peppers and just barely enough water to cover them. (The vegetables
will release a lot of liquid.) Season with salt and pepper and stir
together. Bring to a steady simmer. Simmer, stirring occasionally,
until the chicken is tender and the sauce has reduced, about 45
minutes. Taste, and adjust seasonings.
</P>
<P>
   Ladle the goulash over buttered egg noodles and garnish with
chives. Pass a bowl of sour cream or creme fraiche at the table.

 SECRETS OF SUCCESS: Marimba's Snappy Fish: Arbol chiles and limes 
 combine to create a bold dish   By Michael Bauer  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  It may be surprising to learn that some of the
best fish in the Bay Area can be found at Cafe Marimba, a casual
Mexican restaurant in the Marina.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Started by Reed Hearon and Louise Clement, the restaurant
specializes in the coastal cuisine of Mexico, with dishes like Sea
Bass with Garlic, Chile Arbol and Lime.
</P>
<P>
   The pairing of the sea bass with the smoky chiles is phenomenal.
In preparing the dish, a puree of arbol chiles _ a type of dried
chile widely available at specialty food stores and ethnic markets
_ is seared into the white-fleshed fish. The fish comes out of the
frying pan spicy hot. It's served with a wedge of lime, which helps
tame the fire.
</P>
<P>
   If you have trouble finding Chilean sea bass, Pacific red
snapper or any other tender white fish will work just as well.
</P>
<P>
   At Cafe Marimba, which is now owned solely by Clement, the food
is as bright as the decor, awash in primary colors and Mexican folk
art.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Cafe Marimba, 2317 Chestnut St. (between Scott and Divisadero &LR; 
 &LR; Streets), San Francisco; (415) 776-1506. Lunch Tuesday-Sunday, &LR; 
 &LR; dinner nightly, brunch weekends. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SECRETS OF SUCCESS
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ Searing the fish. &LR;  The spicy arbol chile puree is seared
right into the fish, giving the fish a crusty exterior.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ The lime. &LR;  Don't consider this simply a garnish; it helps to
balance and tame the heat of the chiles.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; SEA BASS WITH GARLIC, CHILE ARBOL &AMP; LIME
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons canola oil
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds Chilean sea bass, cut into 6 portions
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup Arbol Chile Puree (see recipe)
</P>
<P>
   6 arbol chiles for garnish
</P>
<P>
   6 cilantro sprigs for garnish
</P>
<P>
   1 lime, cut into 6 wedges
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Pour the oil onto a dinner plate with a rim and season
generously with salt and pepper. Dip each piece of fish into the
oil mixture and turn to liberally coat.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a large heavy-bottom saute pan over high heat. Working in
batches, place the fish in the pan. Top each fillet with 1 teaspoon
Arbol Chile Puree. Cook until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn
the fish and spread 1 teaspoon of the Arbol Chile Puree on the
cooked side. Continue to cook until the fish just loses the
translucent center, about 3 to 5 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer the fish to plates. Garnish with dried arbol chiles,
cilantro and lime.
</P>
<P>
   Serves 6.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note: &LR;  Although not called for in the recipe, I've found you
can make a sauce from what's left in the pan. It's great with the
fish or drizzled over rice. After the fish has been cooked, add
about 1/2 cup water to the pan (or use reserved chile-soaking water
from the Arbol Chile Puree). Bring to a boil, scraping up all the
browned bits on the bottom of the pan. Boil until reduced by half,
then add another 1/4 cup water. Boil a minute longer. Spoon the
sauce over each serving.

</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:

   1 cup dry arbol chiles (see note)
</P>
<P>
   2 cups hot water
</P>
<P>
   4 large garlic cloves
</P>
<P>
   Kosher salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Place a large saute pan over high heat. When hot, add the chiles
and toast until fragrant about 1 to 2 minutes, turning from time to
time. Transfer the chiles to a large bowl. Pour the hot water over
them and let soak until tender, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Drain, reserving the soaking water. Place the chiles, garlic and
1/4 cup of the chile-soaking water in a blender and puree until
smooth. Add more chile-soaking water if necessary to create a
smooth puree. Strain. Season with salt.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Note:  &LR; Arbol chiles are available at specialty food stores,

 GLORIOUS GRAINS: They're good for you, great tasting and  versatile
as the dickens   By Robin Davis  
 c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle  
   
 SAN FRANCISCO _  Grains get a bad rap. Those who fear a health
conscious world balk at the idea of whole-grain anything, fearing
it will taste like those unfortunate faux meats and vegetarian
casseroles of the '70s.
 &HT;    Grains also suffer from followers of Dr. Atkins, the Sugar
Busters and other low-carb advocates who believe that carbohydrates
are taboo because they make us fat.
 &HT;    It's a shame to demonize grains because there is nothing in the
world of ingredients that's as versatile. They cross cultures as
well as courses, adding texture and flavor to a variety of dishes.
 &HT;    Because grains generally grow easily and inexpensively, most
cuisines have at least one grain that's a staple. Rice, for
example, is a staple for half the world's population. It's critical
to Asian, South American and some European cuisines.
 &HT;    Wheat is second to rice, used abundantly in American baking, but
also prevalent in the form of cracked wheat or bulgur in Middle
Eastern cooking.
 &HT;    Grains aren't limited to side dishes or meatless main courses,
either. Risotto, made with arborio rice, can be made into
sophisticated little patties for appetizers at a formal dinner
party or as part of a brunch buffet. Wheat berries can be cooked up
and served with fresh ricotta cheese and honey for brunch or
dessert. Even barley, used as animal feed in much of the world,
adds hearty texture to soups and stews.
 &HT;    Grains are as varied in flavor and texture as they are in uses.
Some, like millet or Arborio rice, are relatively bland so they
absorb other flavors in the dish. Others, like quinoa and kasha,
have strong nutty flavors and dominate the tastes of other
ingredients.
 &HT;    And truth be told, grains really are some of the most nutritious
foods around. Most offer complex carbohydrates, are low in fat and
are a good source of fiber. But if you're into a high protein,
low-carbohydrate diet, there are grains that fit that category,
too. Quinoa, for example, is considered a complete protein because
it's made up of eight amino acids. It's also lower in carbohydrates
than most other grains. Millet, a popular grain in African cooking,
is also high in protein.
 &HT;    So if you've fallen victim to the whole-grain scare, whip up
some of the recipes inside. They're sure to make you a convert.

 A CONCISE GUIDE TO THE GRANARY  
 
By Robin Davis and Margarita Camacho 
c. 1999 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
 &QL; 
Here's a list of some of our favorite grains and how to cook them.
<P>
   ARBORIO RICE
</P>
<P>
   This high-starch rice is shorter and fatter than any other rice.
It's used primarily in risotto because the starchiness gives the
Italian rice dish its creamy quality.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  Gradually add liquid to the rice, stirring
constantly, and follow a recipe. One cup of rice will absorb
approximately 4 cups of liquid, and takes about 20-25 minutes to
cook. One cup raw rice yields about 3 cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   BARLEY
</P>
<P>
   This round, ivory colored grain dates back to the Stone Age.
Today, much of it is used for animal feed or is malted to make beer
or whisky. Pearl barley has the husk and bran removed and has been
steamed and polished. Hulled or whole-grain barley has just the
outer hull removed and is more nutritious but not as easily
available.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  Cook 1 cup of barley in 3 cups boiling water,
uncovered, until tender but still firm to the bite, about 40-50
minutes. Drain any excess liquid. One cup raw barley yields about 3
cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   BULGUR
</P>
<P>
   Also called cracked wheat, bulgur is a staple of Middle Eastern
cooking. Bulgur is the whole kernel of wheat that has been steamed,
dried and crushed.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  Pour 2 cups boiling water over 1 cup of bulgur,
cover and let stand until the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes.
Uncover and fluff with a fork.
</P>
<P>
   For a slightly more tender grain, cook 1 cup of bulgur in 21/2
cups of water for 15 minutes. Cover the pan, remove it from the
heat and let it steam for 10 minutes until all the liquid is
absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   One cup of uncooked bulgur yields about 23/4 cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   KASHA
</P>
<P>
   In this country, kasha refers to toasted buckwheat groats. In
Russia, it means any cooked grain. Don't confuse kasha with kashi,
a cereal mixture available at some health food stores.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  The traditional method starts with dry-toasting 1
cup of kasha with 1 beaten egg in a skillet over medium heat,
stirring with a fork until the mixture is dry. This step keeps the
grains from sticking together, but it isn't necessary. Cook 1 cup
of kasha in 21/2 cups boiling liquid, covered, for about 20
minutes, until all the liquid is absorbed. Fluff with a fork. One
cup of uncooked kasha yields about 21/2-3 cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   MILLET
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, millet is cultivated almost exclusively
for bird and animal feed, but serves as a food staple for about a
third of the world, including much of Africa.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  Use 3 cups of liquid for every 1 cup of millet.
Cook, uncovered, in simmering water until the water is absorbed and
the grains are tender, about 25 minutes. One cup of uncooked millet
yields about 3 cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   QUINOA
</P>
<P>
   Many people consider this a ``super grain'' because it's so high
in protein. It was a staple for the Incas in Peru, but is fairly
new to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  Rinse the grains before cooking. Simmer 1 cup of
quinoa, uncovered, in 3 cups of liquid until the grains are tender
and the liquid is absorbed, about 30 minutes. One cup of uncooked
quinoa yields about 3 cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   WHEAT BERRIES
</P>
<P>
   These are whole, unprocessed wheat kernels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  Soak wheat berries in water overnight. Drain, then
cook 1 cup of wheat berries, uncovered, in 3 cups of simmering
liquid until tender, about 1 hour. Drain any excess liquid. One cup
of uncooked wheat berries yields about 3 cups cooked.
</P>
<P>
   WILD RICE
</P>
<P>
   This nutty, chewy grain isn't a rice at all but rather a marsh
grass indigenous to the Great Lakes region. Now it's cultivated in
many parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; _ To cook: &LR;  Cook the rice, uncovered, in plenty of boiling
water until most of the grains split, about 45 minutes. Drain
before serving. One cup of uncooked wild rice yields about 4 cups
cooked.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  Most grains are available packaged at many supermarkets. &LR; 
 &LR; Whole Foods, Rainbow Grocery, Draeger's and Berkeley Bowl also &LR; 
 &LR; sell them in bulk. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR; ASIAN-SPICED BEEF BARLEY SOUP
</P>
<P>
   This soup is so thick and rich, it should be eaten as a main
course.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil

 &LR; WILD RICE &AMP; HERB BREAD
</P>
<P>
   Be sure the rice is very well cooked. All of the kernels should
have split open.
</P>
<P>
   Ingredients:
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup wild rice
</P>
<P>
   21/2 cups warm water (105 degrees-115 degrees)
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   1 envelope active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 cups whole-wheat flour
</P>
<P>
   1 cup soy milk powder, or nonfat dry milk powder
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup wheat germ
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped fresh sage, or 2 teaspoons dried ground
sage
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, or 11/2 teaspoons dried
rosemary
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon kosher salt
</P>
<P>
   3 cups (about) bread flour
</P>
<P>
   1 large egg beaten with 2 tablespoons water
</P>
<P>
   Fresh sage leaves for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Instructions:
</P>
<P>
   Cook the rice in a small pot of boiling salted water until very
tender, about 50 minutes. Drain. Cool completely.
</P>
<P>
   Stir together the warm water and honey in the large bowl of an
electric mixer fitted with a dough hook. Sprinkle the yeast over.
Let stand until foamy, about 10 minutes. Add the rice, whole-wheat
flour, dry milk, wheat germ, herbs, oil and salt. Mix until well
blended. Gradually mix in enough bread flour to form a stiff dough.
It should not be too sticky. Cover the dough with plastic wrap and
let rest for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Turn out the dough on a floured surface. Knead until the dough
is smooth and elastic, kneading in more flour if necessary, about
10 minutes. Oil a large bowl. Add the dough, turning to coat. Cover
the bowl with plastic wrap. Let rise in a warm area until doubled
in volume, about 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Punch down the
dough. Turn out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead briefly.
Divide the dough into two equal pieces. Form each piece into a
12x3-inch loaf. Transfer the loaves to the prepared baking sheet.
Cut slits diagonally just through the top of the dough for
decoration. Cover with a clean kitchen towel. Let rise in a warm
area until almost doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Brush the loaves generously with the egg mixture. Press the sage
leaves onto the loaves.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the bread is golden brown and a tester inserted into
the center comes out clean, about 35 minutes. Transfer the loaves
to racks and cool.
</P>
<P>
   Yields 2 loaves.

is cooked, transfer to the bowl with millet. Stir the kale into the
millet. Season generously with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Spray a 11/2-quart baking dish with nonstick vegetable oil
spray. Layer half of the millet mixture into the pan. Sprinkle with
Fontina. Layer in the remaining millet mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Melt the butter in a heavy medium skillet over medium heat. Add
the breadcrumbs and stir until just beginning to brown. Spoon the
breadcrumbs over the millet. Sprinkle with Romano cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Bake until the topping is brown and the mixture is bubbling,
about 30 minutes.

SAN FRANCISCO _  GRAINS  _ Grains get a bad rap. It's a shame to
demonize grains because there is nothing in the world of
ingredients that's as versatile. They cross cultures as well as
courses, adding texture and flavor to a variety of dishes. &HT;    Main story followed by sidebar and recipes.

attempt to do that for Jewish cooking.

salt air can make you hungry. In the area's heyday, in 1937, you
could also have built up an appetite ice skating at Sutro Baths.

of chili from a tiny diner and take-out counter called Louis', just
up the hill from the Cliff House on Point Lobos Avenue.

SAN FRANCISCO _  &UR; POTPOURRI &LR;  _ Spirits sales have been in a slump
for years, even decades by some estimates. The main reason is the
American lighter diet and healthier lifestyle. The only vigor in

because of their mixability and the assumption that white spirits
were lighter than brown spirits.

&HT;     NASA SCIENTIST SAYS MARS PROGRAM TOO AMBITIOUS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. _ Embarrassed by two recent launch
failures, a ranking NASA scientist said the space agency might have
to conserve its resources by developing a less diverse array of
space missions to Mars.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have another failure, the (Mars) program may be at its
end,'' researcher Daniel J. McCleese said in an unusually blunt
speech Tuesday at NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration has launched an all-out robotic assault on Mars and
tried to develop numerous small, low-cost missions to the red
planet. To illustrate the sheer complexity of NASA's ambitions,
McCleese pointed at a slide projection listing the planned Mars
fleet.
</P>
<P>
   The full-page list includes landers that will explore the alien,
rust-red surface of the planet and rovers that will examine the
chemical composition of rocks and transmit pictures to Earth. Other
proposed craft would:
</P>
<P>
   _ Orbit Mars to monitor weather conditions and survey mineral
resources.
</P>
<P>
   _ Land, scoop up rocks and haul them back to Earth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Land at specific sites to investigate narrowly defined
phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The complexity of the program has got us by the neck. ... Look
at how many vehicles we're trying to develop simultaneously,'' said
McCleese, the chief scientist of the Mars program at Jet Propulsion
Laboratory in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Given a tight budget and limited staff, it is hard for NASA to
build so many different craft and launch them at the originally
planned schedule, McCleese said. He echoed concerns about NASA's
Mars program expressed by a recent study panel.
</P>
<P>
   One option is for the space agency to narrow its near-term goals
for Mars exploration. ``A focused program is more likely to succeed
than a broad-brush program,'' the scientist said.
</P>
<P>
   In September and December, NASA lost two highly touted probes
launched to Mars. Both disappeared while nearing the planet _ the
first mainly because of space agency teams' failure to convert
between English and metric units, the second for reasons that
remain under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The twin failures have spurred charges, both inside and outside
NASA, that the space agency is trying to do too much too fast, and
with too little money and staff. As a result, NASA administrator
Daniel Goldin is investigating ways to revamp the Mars program.

   ESSEX, N.Y. _ When Yosef Salaam stayed at a cabin in the
Adirondack hamlet of Essex last summer to work on a play, he never
completely relaxed.
</P>
<P>
   When he walked down a country road near this Lake Champlain
vacation community, he would always step into the drainage ditch
when he heard a car behind him _ just in case.
</P>
<P>
   All because his was the only black face in town.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt very self-conscious,'' said Salaam, a 55-year-old
writer from New York City. ``As a black man, I always keep my
self-preservation on notice.''
</P>
<P>
   Such is the scene around most of the 6 million acres of the
Adirondack Park. The East Coast's largest parcel of wilderness
attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors a year. But when it
comes to diversity, the region could easily be called the ``White
Mountains.''
</P>
<P>
   To an increasing number of people, it is a mystery why the
mountains of northern New York state can remain so racially
one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   The situation is not unique to the Adirondacks.
Environmentalists around the country are increasingly concerned
about the lack of minority involvement in wilderness issues.
</P>
<P>
   Their concern is more than a matter of feeling bad that, for
instance, African-Americans are missing out on Old Faithful or the
Grand Canyon. Many environmentalists think support for their causes
may slip as the populations of blacks, Hispanics and other
minorities increase and more and more minorities land prominent
positions in government and business.
</P>
<P>
   There may come a day when minorities will be in the majority.
And if that majority has no experience with visiting National Parks
and preserving wilderness, what incentive will they have for making
sure these places continue to thrive?
</P>
<P>
   It could happen sooner than you think. In California, according
to U.S. Census Bureau estimates, more than half the state will be a
race other than white by 2025.
</P>
<P>
   Census figures show that the percentage of the overall
population in New York state that is black nearly doubled between
1960 and 1990, from 8.4 percent to 15.9 percent, while the
percentage of the overall population that is white decreased over
the same period from 91.1 percent to 74.4 percent. The trend is
similar nationwide, census data show.
</P>
<P>
   But in the vast Adirondack region of upstate New York, the
minority population has stayed flat in the single digits.
</P>
<P>
   The census also estimates that between 1995 and 2025, the number
of New York state's blacks will increase from 3.2 million to 4
million, while the state's Hispanic population will rise from 2.5
million to 4.3 million. At the same time, whites are projected to
decrease from 14 million to 13.8 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``The demographics of the nation are changing,'' said Neil
Woodworth, council to the Adirondack Mountain Club, a group of
33,000 outdoor enthusiasts that is almost entirely white. ``We want
to have an organization that mirrors the demographics.''
</P>
<P>
   So outdoor groups like the Adirondack club are beginning to
question why so few minorities take part in outdoor activities and
to ask what they can do to change that.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be a mystifying process.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've discussed it, but we don't know what to do,'' said Tom
McGuire, 48, of Rensselaer, an officer at the club's Albany
chapter. ``We're a group of middle-aged white people.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the country, some have already been taking steps. The
National Park Service, for instance, hired its first black director
three years ago. Since then, the NPS is actively recruiting
minority rangers, talking to minority groups about visiting park
lands and developing historic sites like Martin Luther King Jr.'s
house in Atlanta to appeal to minority visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The National Audubon Society has dealt with the issue by
recently recruiting the black actor James Earl Jones and a Hispanic
man onto their national board, while local Audubon groups are asked
to reach out to minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not an easy issue to broach. Even the question ``Why
are there so few blacks in the Adirondacks?'' can be answered in
plenty of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of them just don't know they can come up and do this
kind of stuff. They only know their own neighborhood,'' said Lisa
Williams, a black Atlanta woman who grew up in Delmar, N.Y., and
skied frequently in the Adirondacks.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason, she said, is that most African-Americans,
Hispanics and other minorities live in cities _ an urban
environment that leaves them unable to fathom why anyone would
enjoy walking in the woods, swimming in a lake or skiing on a cold,
winter day.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're not used to trees and quiet,'' Williams said.
``They're used to the hustle and bustle of the street.''
</P>
<P>
   There is another reason: Some minorities do not feel comfortable
in a place where everyone else is white.
</P>
<P>
   Alice Green, an Albany resident who grew up in the Adirondack
town of Witherbee, still remembers the reaction of a fellow
African-American woman who saw Green on her hometown street last
summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was eating an ice cream cone, and she almost ran up to me
and hugged me,'' Green recalled. ``She said, `Oh my God, I'm so
happy to see a brown face.'''
</P>
<P>
   Now 55 and director of the Center for Law and Justice in Albany,
Green says that's not a surprising reaction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know people who go up there now who find it kind of
unfriendly, because there are no people of color,'' she said. ``If
you don't see people of color, you sort of get the impression it's
not for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who make the Adirondacks home do so for familiar reasons,
regardless of race. John Battle, a retired Navy man who is black,
moved into the hamlet of Essex with his wife two years ago. He
loves hiking and fishing, and after 25 years working around
submarines, has long become immune to being the only dark face in a
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll stay here as long as the spirit moves me,'' he said.

   New York state has taken its own steps to bring minorities into
the mountains, with mixed results. In the past few decades,
state-funded programs like Higher Horizons and the Adirondack
Wilderness Challenge have taken urban youths on Outward Bound-type
adventures to improve their self-esteem and to keep them out of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Despite national advertising, the state has only found one
minority employee for its program in six years, said Pat Daly of
the state Office of Children and Family Services.
</P>
<P>
   The state Department of Environmental Conservation has not had
much recruitment luck either. Currently, there are no black forest
rangers, either on duty or in the academy. Few even take the civil
service test, said Capt. Dan Walsh.
</P>
<P>
   But the department is working on ways to change that, said
ranger Capt. Louis Curth, who recently prepared a report on ways to
find rangers who are minorities. He suggests creating ``Urban
Rangers,'' whose job would be to work with minority communities and
try to instill an interest in the outdoors.

   African-Americans have been in the Adirondacks almost as long as
white people have.
</P>
<P>
   In 1846 in North Elba _ the town where Lake Placid is now
located _ abolitionist Gerritt Smith donated 100 parcels of land to
southern black families looking to escape racism or slavery.
Thirteen years before Harpers Ferry, John Brown came to the region
to teach farming (a time period that will be commemorated this
summer at the John Brown Homestead outside Lake Placid).
</P>
<P>
   Most lasted only a few years, chased away by the rough terrain,
short growing season and brutal winters.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1890s, some black workers arrived to help build William
Seward Webb's railroad through the Adirondacks. In the 1930s, more
blacks would come to work at mining jobs in the center of the
wilderness. A few decades later, hotel service jobs would bring
black workers to the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to bring more African-Americans up to the
mountains, Green now invites black writers to stay at a cabin she
owns in Essex. For some, it can be an educational experience.
</P>
<P>
   Everett Hoagland, poet and English professor at the University
of Massachusetts in North Dartmouth, stayed there in June 1998. It
was a lesson in the joys of nature _ and the dangers of reverse
racism.
</P>
<P>
   Hoagland said he went there ready to experience what he calls
``Yankee coolness.'' Then, one day while trying to get to his
daughter's graduation, he found himself stuck at a closed gas
station with a flat tire. Within a few minutes, a local family _
whom Hoagland had dismissed as ``rednecks'' _ found someone who
plugged his flat and sent him on his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reminded how wrong I was,'' he said. ``And how wrong it
was to make prejudgments.''

TURKISH LEGISLATORS REJECT IDEA OF ADDITIONAL TERM FOR DEMIREL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Defying Turkey's aged political elite,
Parliament Wednesday rejected a constitutional amendment that would
have allowed President Suleyman Demirel to seek a second term.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal to change the constitution, which limits presidents
to one term of seven years, received 303 votes, considerably short
of the 367 needed for a two-thirds majority. As a result, Demirel
will have to step down next month and be succeeded by a new
president chosen by Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was not only a defeat for Demirel but also for Prime
Minister Bulent Ecevit, who had campaigned hard for Demiral on the
grounds that he was ``a factor for stability.'' But there was no
immediate indication that Ecevit's government was in danger of
collapsing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our government will continue its duty in harmony and
determination,'' Ecevit said after the vote. ``We hope the result
was what was best for our nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Demirel and Ecevit are in their 70s, and the vote in
Parliament suggested that their generation's hold on Turkish
politics may finally be slipping. In another sign of that slippage,
the leader of the main opposition party, who is also in his 70s, is
being challenged for party leadership by a young insurgent.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Turkish presidency has little formal authority,
Demirel has accumulated considerable power in the seven years he
has served. During that time, Turkey was characterized by fractured
and short-lived governments, and Demirel eagerly moved to fill the
vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   One of his successes was seizing control of Turkey's foreign
policy toward the new nations of the Balkans, Caucasus and Central
Asia. Yet even on issues like this, his leaving office does not
seem likely to push Turkey in new directions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real meaning is that our political system is starting to
mature,'' said Soli Ozel, a university professor who wrote several
newspaper columns opposing Demirel's re-election. ``Poll after poll
suggested that 70 to 75 percent of the people didn't want another
term. This was a worn-out face and a worn-out figure. The passing
of the torch has begun.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Demirel, an engineer by profession, began his political career
in the 1950s and became prime minister for the first time in 1965.
He held that office seven times before rising to the presidency in
1993. Two of his terms as prime minister were ended by military
coups.
</P>
<P>
   Although he is often described as a conservative, Demirel has
shown remarkable ideological flexibility. He is an outspoken
secularist who once pushed a strongly pro-Islamic agenda, and a
victim of military intervention who became a defender of the
military's role in politics.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks Demirel suggested that if he were not permitted
to seek another presidential term, he would return to party
politics. Whether voters would respond to him as enthusiastically
as they did in decades past, however, seems uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey has changed enormously since Demirel began his political
career. Most of the population is less than half his age, and many
people view him as a symbol of an ossified political system that
has kept the country from completing its transition to democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had acquired the status of a regional statesmen,'' said a
European ambassador in Ankara. ``He created a good image of Turkey,
which had nothing to do with his past or what the Turkish people
thought of him,'' the ambassador said. ``Progressives here will
want to see this as a democratic breakthrough. If it is, then of
course that's important in terms of the country's political
development. But as far as the rest of the world is concerned, who
really cares who's the president of Turkey?''
</P>
<P>
   Parliament is now expected to begin a period of intense
bargaining as a prelude to the election of a new president. More
than a dozen names of possible candidates have already been
suggested, and more are likely to emerge in the coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit's fear that a change of presidents might provoke
instability was based partly on the prospect that each party in his
three-party coalition might nominate its own presidential
candidate. But leaders of the three parties have reportedly pledged
to keep the government together even if they fight over the
presidency. They may try to settle on a compromise candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``A new president will be elected without any special problem,''
predicted Yucel Seckiner, a member of Parliament who voted against
offering Demirel a second term. ``There will be no instability.''

BUSY `BLACK AND WHITE' IS MUDDLED ALL OVER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Writer-director James Toback appears to have cast ``Black and
White'' after a night of reading gossip columns and channel-hopping
between MTV and ESPN. Rappers, models, athletes and fringe
celebrities overpopulate the movie, sometimes portraying themselves
or a reasonable facsimile thereof, other times in roles they have
no business playing.
</P>
<P>
   Toback wants us to see a turn-of-the-century melting pot, but
the ingredients don't blend smoothly, and he winds up with a
cinematic mulligan stew. This is one of those movies that tries to
say so much that what it ultimately says is superficial. It's meant
to be a meditation on racial and sexual relations, but the stunt
casting and busy atmosphere turn it into a muddled curiosity piece.
</P>
<P>
   The movie's bound to attract the attention of pop-culture
obsessives, though, thanks to the bizarre parade of familiar faces
it puts on display. Brooke Shields, in dreadlocks no less, is at
the forefront of one of the movie's plot lines. She plays Sam
Donager, a filmmaker making a documentary about white teens who are
fascinated with hip-hop culture. Robert Downey Jr., virtually
repeating his ``Wonder Boys'' role, is her
closeted-with-the-door-wide-open gay husband, Terry, who comes on
to every man he meets, including Mike Tyson, in a self-deprecating
turn as himself _ if his real self is a pensive and regretful
ex-con who just wants to be left alone. This affords us the rare
opportunity to watch one celebrity ex-con, Tyson, assault another
celebrity law breaker, Downey, onscreen.
</P>
<P>
   Pop singer Bijou Phillips cops Halle Berry's (or maybe Warren
Beatty's) ``Bulworth'' attitude as a subject of Sam's documentary,
a girl who'd rather hang out with Rich, a street thug (Power of the
Wu-Tang Clan) with rap-mogul ambitions, than with her confused
boyfriend (an underused Elijah Wood). Rich's best friend is Dean, a
college basketball star played by Allan Houston of the New York
Knicks; he's also earned the attentions of a white woman, a grad
student played by model Claudia Schiffer in one of the movie's more
bizarre casting moves. Dean is at the center of the movie's other
loose plot line, as he gets in trouble when he agrees to throw a
game at the behest of a shady character played by Ben Stiller. And
if you've seen 1998's dreary ``Permanent Midnight,'' you probably
already know not to trust a movie that features an unshaven Stiller
clad all in black.
</P>
<P>
   So much is going on here _ I haven't even mentioned the Marla
Maples cameo _ that ``Black and White'' eventually sinks into its
own cross-cultural mire. The movie's examination of wannabe-black
white teens is old hat by now, and ignores more current phenomena
such as the rap-metal fusion that's fueled platinum-selling bands
such as Korn and Limp Bizkit (although we should probably be
thankful that Toback didn't cast the latter's Fred Durst). Toback's
ambitions are admirable, and they might even cause some observers
to consider the movie provocative. But it's so crowded and
gimmicky, it winds up being merely pretentious.

CHOICES, CHOICES: A MODERN MORALITY PLAY

   &UR; Central High, from Destiny Interactive; Windows 95 and 98;
$39.95; ages 10 to 16. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   In 10 years, we might look back at the game Central High and
view it as a small token of desperation in the aftermath of the
shootings at Columbine High School. Central High, a new game from
Destiny Interactive, is a poignant attempt to help patch up a
society gone wrong: a computer game produced by adults in the hope
that it will teach teen-agers that it's a bad idea to torture their
misfit peers. The concept is doomed from the start.
</P>
<P>
   You can hardly blame Destiny Interactive _ a group of
psychologists, educators and social workers _ for wanting to do
something to prevent future violence. The reasoning seems to be
that if the pundits are correct in blaming shoot-'em-up video games
like Quake and Doom for at least some violence by teen-agers, why
not make a game that will teach adolescents how to make better
moral decisions?
</P>
<P>
   Central High takes that conceit and runs with it. The game is a
full-length, interactive feature film for your computer; you make
the decisions that will help shape the plot. Make the right
decisions and you win; make the wrong ones and you lose.
</P>
<P>
   The player takes on the role of Kevin, a teen-ager living in a
bucolic suburban town. Kevin has, for some unknown reason, been
selected to save the world from an equally vague fate at the hands
of some angry but unseen aliens. Each decision he makes in the
course of six days will help decide the future of his fellow
Earthlings.
</P>
<P>
   As Kevin, you face hundreds of questions throughout the week,
ranging from whether to eat a salad for dinner to whether to talk
back to your teacher and whether to steal Dad's car. It's a kind of
choose-your-own-adventure for moralists: make the wrong decision
and a little yellow light on the bottom of your screen comes on.
Once six lights go on, you lose; you have to start over again if
you want to save the human race. Whether the lights go on depends
on a complicated point system in which the worst decisions cost you
16 points and the best cost nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Kevin's apparently idyllic life _ a nuclear family,
including a sister nicknamed Squirt and a dog called Max _ the
teen-agers around him are a messed-up group. There are bulimic
girls, insecure bullies, suicidal adolescents and (this being a
post-Columbine game) a few trod-upon Goth kids for good measure.
For additional points, Kevin has to steer them all toward the
righteous path, demonstrating what the instructions describe as the
``11 strengths'': integrity, honesty, responsibility, respect,
self-discipline, compassion, tolerance, kindness, caring, courage
and commitment.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the decisions players face are no-brainers _ should
Kevin participate in a playground fight or play peacekeeper? _ that
don't even require you to watch the film to get right. But others
are perplexing. What, you have to wonder, are the moral questions
inherent in the decision to watch television for a few minutes?
</P>
<P>
   The game never explains why some decisions prove to be the wrong
ones. That is where the game's pretenses to moral instruction begin
to break down. If Central High is supposed to help teen-agers learn
morals and ethics, shouldn't the game better explain why one
decision is bad and another is wise? Why, for example, is it a bad
idea for Kevin to snitch on a classmate who cheats on a test but a
good idea to snitch on a classmate who uses drugs? And why does the
light turn on when you instruct Kevin to study his math before
breakfast? There is some inscrutable agenda here, and you can't
help wondering whose ethics you are learning.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the game is downright hard to win. I lost three times
in a row before giving up in frustration _ and if it's difficult
for an adult with a presumably well-developed moral sense to muddle
through these decisions, it's hard to believe that a confused
teen-ager could ever win.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, you have to start over from scratch every time
you lose, watching the same movie footage but making different
decisions. The fourth time you listen to the cloying breakfast
chatter of Kevin's family, you'll probably want to throw the game
across the room. ``Have a nice day, dear!'' Mom says cheerily again
and again and again. ``Don't forget your backpack.'' That in itself
could drive teen-agers to violence.
</P>
<P>
   After a while, it becomes tempting to pick the clearly incorrect
answers just to see what will happen to Kevin if he buys a stolen
CD or gossips with a schoolmate. In my own malicious mind, I wanted
to find out if he would turn into a killer, or at least become a
little antisocial. The result, unfortunately, is a letdown. Nothing
happens _ the game just ends. No aliens materialize, and there are
no huge explosions. You're just supposed to sit through endless
hours of repetitive dialogue with no ultimate payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, it did not occur to the game makers that games
should be fun. Sure, adolescents should want to help Kevin make the
right choices and save the world from unseen aliens, but there are
some real aliens over at Quake that are looking for a good
blasting. Which would you choose?

<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ There are not many milkmen these days making
the rounds of America's towns and suburbs. But Westchester County
north of New York City has at least one, Hercules Bontzolakes, 48,
who is the old-fashioned, ``pay when you can, cream floats to the
top'' real McCoy, the classic purveyor of milk, cream, cottage
cheese, eggs and juice. His glass bottles with their crimped paper
tops hold Oak Tree Dairy milk from Long Island and Ronnybrook Farm
Dairy milk from Ancramdale in the Hudson Valley. The orders are
handwritten on paper and left in the milk box for him.
</P>
<P>
   Bontzolakes, who lives near Purchase, dons long silk underwear,
sweats and a heavy plaid flannel jacket every night at 10 to begin
work. (He needs the warm clothes even in summer, because the
temperature in his truck is 33 to 36 degrees to keep the milk
cool.) He kisses his wife, Catherine, good night, says goodbye to
his son, Alexander, almost 3, and climbs behind the wheel of his
lumbering 8-and-a-half-ton truck. He calls it his ``rolling
billboard'' with ``Milk and More: Cat's Dairy'' lettered on the
side. ``Cat'' is for Catherine. But this is not a dairy in the true
sense of the word. It's a milk delivery system.
</P>
<P>
   His stock comes primarily from Oak Tree in East Northport. At
about 11, his order of milk, eggs, cheese and juice is delivered to
him in a parking lot at an auto body shop in White Plains. His
payload is 4 to 6 tons of dairy products, which he delivers to
darkened homes in towns like South Salem, Valhalla and Greenwich,
Conn.
</P>
<P>
   His best-selling milk is Oak Tree 1 percent fat, at $2.86 for a
half gallon, about the same price as at a convenience store. He has
encountered increasing demand for organic milk and is about to add
it, for a price. His own favorite is Ronnybrook's chocolate whole
milk ($3.09 a quart). ``Straight from the thick glass bottle, it is
more simply delicious than a bowl of the best ice cream,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   All this started for Bontzolakes in 1984, when he bought the
routes in the White Plains area from Ray Marsh, who retired. In
1989, he expanded into northern Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   That means that in this bucolic area north of Manhattan, a white
milk truck still moves through the dark and lumbers to a stop.
Moments later, the hinged top of the milk box squeaks open. Empties
clink out, full ones clunk in, a routine that has almost
disappeared from this country.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Bontzolakes is a quixotic throwback or a visionary
revivalist remains to be seen. But in Chappaqua alone, his
customers have tripled in the last year. Many are transplanted
Manhattanites, not lifelong small towners.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 percent of Americans had their milk and other dairy
products delivered in the 1950s. In the '70s, with the rise of
working mothers, the number dropped to 10 percent. These days less
than 1 percent of Americans have milk delivered to their homes. Dr.
Ed Johnston, the milk marketing specialist in the state Agriculture
Department, said that, based on an annual survey, only 0.4 percent
of packaged milk products in New York was sold by home delivery in
October 1998.
</P>
<P>
   How could this service have ever gone out of style? Besides its
comforting rhythm, milk delivery makes sense. According to the U.S.
Agriculture Department, the average American drinks about 17
gallons of milk a year. Children 5 to 9 drink nearly 28 gallons
each a year. In suburbs full of young families, like these in
Westchester, that is a lot of trips to the convenience store.
</P>
<P>
   The milkman is a low-tech, real-life service that some people
are willing to pay a premium for, just as they will consider
ordering their groceries from a Web site. It's an idea whose time
went and has come again: for pennies more than store-bought milk, a
punctual human being delivers the most basic of sustenances to a
customer's front door.
</P>
<P>
   Bontzolakes gently and courteously threads his fat rumbling
truck through the single-lane labyrinth of stone-walled alleys and
white picket fences of this town, on back streets and in hidden
pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, even with the refrigeration, Bontzolakes' truck smells
like milk and milk products. ``Don't you gotta love it?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up in the South Bronx and learned about cows as a guest
each summer on a dairy farm in rural Pennsylvania, courtesy of the
Fresh Air Fund. ``It was love at first sight,'' he said. All his
life, he knew he wanted to have something to do with milk.
</P>
<P>
   One stop on the route had a broad, circular drive, with its own
fountain, one of the grander mansions in the county. Minutes after
that came a family on Whippoorwill Road, whose football player sons
require biweekly jugs of 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   From the milk truck it is possible to watch early birds slip out
the door to open their milk boxes and wave sleepily. Just before
sunrise, a few Wall Street dads whiz by, already off to work. At
each house where eggs are on order, Bontzolakes stops dead in his
tracks, opens the carton and gingerly wobbles each egg to be sure
there are no cracked shells. That's what service means, or should
mean, in a service industry.

A SLIMMER ALTERNATIVE: BIFOLD DOORS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ART ADV: Graphic is being sent to NYT graphic clients.
Nonsubscribers can purchase one-time rights by calling 888-603-1036
or 888-346-9867.) 
 By EDWARD R. LIPINSKI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bifold doors are a practical alternative to the swing-out doors
and the sliding doors usually found in homes. They require less
clearance than swing doors to open, and unlike the sliding doors
installed on closets, bifold ones fold back to expose the entire
contents of the closet.
</P>
<P>
   Bifolds are really two doors hinged at the center. They open by
folding back accordion-style against the door frame. There are no
hinges at the side jambs. Instead, the doors pivot in brackets
positioned at the top and bottom corners of the doorway. A roller
guide mounted at the top of the door's leading edge slides in a
track secured to the top jamb. This roller-track arrangement
supports and guides the door as it is opened.
</P>
<P>
   Bifold doors are available in either plastic or wood and in two
standard heights: 6 feet 8 inches and 7 feet. You can trim wooden
doors slightly to fit a smaller frame, but you cannot cut plastic
doors. You can also order bifold doors to fit odd-sized frames.
</P>
<P>
   If you plan to install bifold doors, it is best to buy them in a
kit. The kit will include all the necessary hardware: the track,
pivot pins, pivot brackets and handles. Also, the doors will come
already hinged together. You must however buy the stop molding for
the door frame separately.
</P>
<P>
   Before purchasing the doors, measure the dimensions of the frame
carefully; then decide whether you need one two-door unit (two
doors hinged together) or a multiple unit consisting of two
two-door units. A single two-door unit is adequate for a standard
door frame. The door will fold back to one side of the frame. For
wider frames, install two units, one on each side. The doors must
fit into the opening correctly or they will not open and close
properly.
</P>
<P>
   If the door frame is a standard size, the installation will
consist of mounting the stop molding to the jambs, attaching the
slider track to the top jamb, screwing the pivot brackets in the
corners and putting the doors in place. Before doing this, however,
take the time to check the frame carefully to make sure that it is
perfectly plumb and square. Use a level across the top and sides of
the frame to see if it is plumb. Check the corners with a framing
square and make sure they are at 90-degree angles. If the frame is
not square or plumb, the doors will jamb when you fold them in or
out.
</P>
<P>
   You can adjust a frame that is out of alignment with thin wooden
wedges, called shims. First, pry off the trim around the door. This
will expose gap between the jamb and the framing studs. Insert a
pry bar between the jamb and the studs and gently pry the jamb back
a little. It is not necessary to pull the jamb off the stud; simply
loosen it so you can remove the nails holding it in place. Push
shims between the jamb and the studs to adjust the jamb until it is
square and plumb.
</P>
<P>
   Secure the jamb with new finishing nails, but leave the heads
protruding slightly in case you have to make adjustments when the
doors are in place. You may have to wedge both side jambs and the
top one to square up the frame. In extreme cases, you will have to
remove and reconstruct the entire frame.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is to nail the stop molding to the jambs with 6d
nails. The molding should be positioned so it fits inside the frame
but is flush with the front edges of the jambs. Next, screw the
track to the top jamb; the necessary wood screws will be provided
in the kit. The distance between the center of the track and the
stop molding should be half the thickness of the door plus an
eighth inch. Screw the bottom pivot brackets into place on the
floor. They should align vertically with the pivot brackets in the
track.
</P>
<P>
   Set the doors in place by sliding the door pivot pins into the
top and bottom pivot brackets. These are spring-loaded so you can
push them back to gain clearance as you maneuver the door over the
bracket holes. Next, depress the track guide on the top of door and
slide it into top track. Now test how the door opens and closes.
</P>
<P>
   If you experience difficulty, you can make minor adjustments to
the door alignment by turning the adjustment screws in the top and
bottom pivot brackets. You can also make adjustments to the frame
alignment with additional shims.
</P>
<P>
   When door operation is smooth, finish nailing the jamb, then
mount the trim molding around the door frame. Countersink all nail
heads and fill the holes with wood filler. Finally, attach the
knobs to the doors.

HIGH VOLTAGE FOR HIGH-TECH CARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Mass., Colo.. Pa.)   By ANNE EISENBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Electrical systems in cars are about to hit their limits. If
power brakes, power steering and air-conditioning have not drained
them, additions like cell phones, Internet connections, heated
mirrors and seats, rear air-conditioning blowers and electronic
navigation will surely suck up any power that remains.
</P>
<P>
   And that is only the beginning. Next-generation cars will have
even more features, like electromagnetically controlled suspensions
designed to let riders float over bumps and jolts, as well as
electronic motor controls that will reduce both gasoline
consumption and polluting emissions.
</P>
<P>
   The current electrical systems just can't cope. So behind the
scenes, auto makers and suppliers have spent the past few years
planning a replacement: 42-volt systems. These mini-power plants
will be on the scene as soon as 2004. While current systems provide
up to 3 kilowatts, or 3,000 watts, of power, the new high-voltage
systems will provide 8 kilowatts or more.
</P>
<P>
   The change will be a major one because connectors, wiring,
batteries, alternators, cables, switching and many other components
will have to be re-engineered.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtually every system on the car is affected,'' said Cary
Wilson, director of electrical and electronic systems at Ford Motor
Co. Despite the complexity of the job, Wilson said, it is clear
that little additional power can be wrung from the present systems
and that full-scale change is imminent. ``It's not a matter of
if,'' he said, ``but a matter of when.''
</P>
<P>
   BMW may be the first to introduce the new high-voltage systems.
``We plan to have a 42-volt system in place as early as 2004,''
said Dr. Peter Thoma, manager of electrical and electronic systems
at the BMW Group in Munich. ``The future car will still have a
combustion engine, but other than that, it makes sense to go with
pure electric power.''
</P>
<P>
   New 42-volt systems like BMW's will probably feature one
powerful, integrated device that is both a starter and a generator.
</P>
<P>
   ``The starter as we know it today, that only rotates when you
are trying to start the car, will be removed,'' said Dr. Thomas
Keim, co-director of a consortium, based at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, on advanced electrical and electronic
components and systems. ``And so will the generator or alternator
that sits outside the engine at the front of the car, driven by a
rubber belt.''
</P>
<P>
   The replacement for these parts is a new machine that will
function as a starter and then, when the engine is running, as an
alternator. The integrated starter and alternator will probably be
mounted on the crankshaft between the transmission and the engine,
Keim said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford is considering that kind of setup. ``We are looking at one
integrated starter and alternator combined in a machine that goes
between the engine and the transmission,'' Wilson said. With such a
device, a car's engine would shut down at a traffic light, and
then, with a burst of power, start up again in an instant.
(Actually, it would take about a fifth of a second.)
</P>
<P>
   Cary predicted that auto makers would gradually convert to
42-volt systems, starting with dual, hybrid systems offering both
the older voltage and the new 42-volt system. ``Fuel economy,
instant start-stop and maybe electrical power steering and brakes
could take advantage of the 42-volt system,'' he said, while
lighting, the stereo and other applications could be handled by the
older system.
</P>
<P>
   Thoma, of BMW, prefers the idea of switching directly to a full
42-volt system. ``We are more interested in jumping directly into
42 volts,'' he said. ``If you have two voltages, it means more cost
and more weight.''
</P>
<P>
   A consortium sponsored by the Society for Automotive Engineers
in Warrendale, Pa., is looking into standards for 42-volt systems,
as are several other international groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all very eager to sing off the same sheet of paper,''
said Keim, whose coalition at MIT includes 44 auto makers and
suppliers. The group meets regularly to hash out issues underlying
standards for the new system. ``There are so many issues that need
to be worked out when you combine voltages,'' Keim said. ``For
instance, what is the standard for jump-starting a car?'' he asked,
pointing to the possibility of damage when different voltages
collide.
</P>
<P>
   Although many kinks must be worked out, Keim said that 42-volt
systems would improve engine efficiency while reducing emissions.
That will happen not only through the stopping and starting of the
engine, but through enhancements like electronically driven engine
valves, which will carefully control the input and exit of air and
fuel. Experts also expect electronic clutches, heated catalytic
converters that will reduce emissions and steering and braking
systems that will eliminate hydraulics.
</P>
<P>
   The new 42-volt systems are likely to appear first in luxury
cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many advantages,'' said Richard T. Johnson,
engineering director for Bolder Technologies in Golden, Colo., a
battery manufacturer. ``All the accessories that are presently on
the drive belts will be electrical so they won't have to run all
the time.'' Accessories like air-conditioning consume power whether
they are being used or not. ``You are driving the belt whether the
air-conditioning is on or off, turning energy into heat,'' he said.
With the 42-volt system, accessories like air-conditioning
compressors and power steering motors will be driven not by belts
but by the electronic system.
</P>
<P>
   Although automakers and suppliers are not certain when 42-volt
systems will arrive, there is a consensus about one thing: the
public is going to call it a 36-volt system, just as they describe
the present system as 12-volt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's actually a 14-volt system, the voltage of today's 12-volt
cars when running,'' Keim said. ``But people judge by the
battery.'' The 12-volt battery so familiar to car owners,
especially when it dies on a cold day, actually has an operating
voltage of 14 volts once the engine is running.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers will probably think of the voltage as three times 12
or 36,'' he said, ``even though it will be three times 14, or 42.''

COOKBOOK AUTHOR HAS QUICK FIX FOR DINNER ON THE RUN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ART CHAPMAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If anyone knows the difficulty of fixing a meal on the run, it
is cookbook author Holly Clegg.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from being the ``Louisiana Yam Lady'' for the Louisiana
Sweet Potato Commission, Clegg has also written four ``Trim &AMP;
Terrific'' cookbooks. She has appeared on many TV shows, including
``NBC Weekend,'' ``Donahue,'' and ``Crook &AMP; Chase.''She is a wife
and mother of three.
</P>
<P>
   She is busy. In her latest book, ``Meals on the Move: Rush Hour
Recipes'' she writes: ``To all the busy people who never have
enough time in the day but recognize the importance of eating
healthier. This book is for you!''
</P>
<P>
   Clegg is a familiar face in Fort Worth. She stays in touch with
her former Paschal High School classmates; her parents _ Jerry and
Ruth Berkowitz _ still live in town.
</P>
<P>
   She began studying cooking as an undergraduate at Tulane
University in New Orleans. She attended the Cordon Bleu Cooking
School in London and has taken classes at the Cordon Bleu and La
Varenne cooking schools in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Mike, live with their three children in
Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   In a quick telephone conversation, Clegg, who is usually
reserved in appraisals of her own work, confided, ``I truly believe
`Meals on the Move' is my best cookbook, with such a powerful
message about long-term eating plans.''
</P>
<P>
   Clegg said her newest book is a common-sense approach for
today's hectic lifestyle, and she emphasizes that her recipes are
``simple, fun and nutritious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Louisiana Kitchen'' was the first book in her ``Trim &AMP;
Terrific'' series. It was self-published and sold thousands of
copies. It eventually caught the attention of a New York publisher
and was marketed nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Clegg resisted the publisher at first, wanting to keep tighter
controls on her work. She insisted on spiral binders and
easy-to-read recipes. She won out and enjoyed success on two
additional ``Trim &AMP; Terrific'' books.
</P>
<P>
   But the new one is again self-published. ``My children really
didn't want me to take off on another one of those long book
promotional tours,'' she said. ``And I didn't want to go, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Clegg has managed to get her latest work in all major
bookstores, she said, and she is doing a promotional tour for Sam's
Wholesale Club, where her book is the featured book for April.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meals on the Move'' is typical of Clegg's work. She doesn't
try to dazzle anyone with culinary hyperbole. Each recipe has a few
notes on the top, a hint or two for making it even more healthful,
and a complete nutritional analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Clegg worked with the American Institute for Cancer Research on
the analysis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I suspect that one of the most popular sections of my book
will be the `Mix &AMP; Match Menu Planner,' which helps provide easy
answers for those problem-dinner nights,'' Clegg writes in her book
notes. ``Also included is a `Tips &AMP; Tricks' list that helps you
stock the pantry, provides substitution items and shares some
inventive ideas.''
</P>
<P>
   Clegg has her own Web site: www.hollyclegg.com.
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sample recipe from the more than 200 in ``Meals on the
Move,'' $19.95:

THE OLIVE: FROM TREE TO TOOTHPICK
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanies OLIVES) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The olive is a curious little creature, and we have managed to
make it curiouser.
</P>
<P>
   Bitter when picked from the tree, the olive must be treated to
become edible. Sometimes that treatment is a lye bath, sometimes a
more gentle brining technique that leaches out the bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   The American ``ripe'' olive is simply the green olive by another
name. The black olives are picked green, treated for bitterness and
then pumped with oxygen, which turns them from green to black.
Those not treated with the oxygen are sold as green olives.
However, black olives from elsewhere (Greece, Sicily, Morroco) are
truly ripe _ they were allowed to ripen on the tree.
</P>
<P>
   The ubiquitous pimento, once the only stuffing seen in an olive,
is inserted via the wonders of food processing. The pimentos are
thrown into a processor, seeds and all, and ground. The peppers are
then compressed to make a continuous strip of pimento ``ribbon.''
That ribbon is extruded from a machine in a width that perfectly
fits the hole of a pitted olive.
</P>
<P>
   For all intents and purposes, California is Olive Central in the
United States, with most olives being grown in the hottest areas.
It's natural that California would hold the crown; it was the
Spanish who brought the Old World olive to the New World missions.
</P>
<P>
   And it's California that is leading the resurgence in
``boutique'' olives with small processors, such as Capay Olives. At
Capay, owner Bruce Beauchamp hand-stuffs local olives with pickled
garlic, jalapeno peppers and sun-dried tomatoes, resulting in
olives that give the fruit a whole new attitude.

 &HT;    Harmony-rich family needs to mine deeper
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Nashville is infatuated these days with artists who have barely
passed puberty, but the family trio the Wilkinsons is more
deserving of attention than most. Eighteen-year-old Amanda and her
16-year-old brother, Tyler, backed by their professorial-looking
dad Steve, can serve up harmonies nearly as seamless as the Everly
Brothers. Their first album showed great promise, particularly the
love-your-mama single, ``26 Cents.''
</P>
<P>
   On this followup, the trio's vocals are as rich as buttermilk.
But when it comes to material, they've struck a sour note. Most of
these tunes have little personality or backbone. The production is
often perplexing _ strings lifted off of ``Eleanor Rigby.'' Guitars
straight out of a Vegas lounge review. A bizarre novelty tune
(``Hypothetically'') that's a cross between ``Counting Flowers on
the Wall'' and something off the Monkees' ``Capricorn, Aquarius,
Pisces and Jones.''
</P>
<P>
   With a voice that resonates like strings across a cello, Amanda
has one of the most promising futures in country music. Get her
some good songs and some country instrumentation to go along with
it.

 &HT;    Force is still with us, though dazzle is gone
 &HT;    By Steve Murray

<TEXT>
<P>
   Is George Lucas' movie visually amazing? Yes. Exciting?
Sometimes. Emotionally involving? Almost never. As a technological
Mount Everest (and the Mount McKinley of marketing), ``The Phantom
Menace'' is a remarkable achievement. Too bad writer-director Lucas
left out the gee-whiz enthusiasm of the original movies. He also
left out memorable characters. He left out the fun. Priced to buy:
VHS pan-and-scan, $24.98; wide-screen collectible edition, $39.98
(includes a behind-the-scenes documentary, 48 page collector's book
and 35mm strip from an original ``Menace'' theatrical print).

   &QR;  ``The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc'' (R) _ When Joan
(Milla Jovovich) rallies her troops to victory against the British,
the movie has considerable visual oomph. But when the swordplay
slows and the characters talk, you realize it doesn't know what to
make of its heroine. It hedges its bets, presenting her as equal
parts saint and teenage fanatic. The result is, pardon the term,
half-baked. Grade: C+

   &QR;  ``For Love of the Game'' (PG-13) _ No matter how hard it tries

first learns that his team is being sold and he'll be traded, and
then that his girlfriend is dumping him. As he pitches what could

<P>
   Grade: A
</P>
<P>
   With Oasis' new album in free fall from the U.S. album charts,
this Scottish quartet is the new British hope. Like touring partner
Oasis, Travis plays basic, no-frills rock. Unlike Oasis,
vocalist/songwriter Fran Healy and company do it with a lot of
heart and much less bluster. Travis' first album, ``Good Feeling,''
was a callow but enjoyable collection of riff-heavy tunes. Taking a
giant leap forward, ``The Man Who'' brims with gorgeous melodies
and spacious arrangements anchored by Healy's tough and tender
vocals. One listen and ``Driftwood,'' ``Writing to Reach You'' and
``Why Does It Always Rain on Me'' are lodged in the brain.
Memorable, gimmick-free pop-rock is a difficult thing to pull off.
Travis makes it sound easy.

   In one corner of the musical battle royal between solo female
singers, we've got Christina Aguilera. In another, Britney Spears.
Both are Mickey Mouse Club graduates and role models to the
countless youthful blondes to follow. Make room for Pink, whose
personality would have that mouse shaking in his big yellow shoes.
But, hey, at least he'd be warned. First track ``Split
Personality'' features one side of the singer talking to her dark
side. But the scariest thing about the song is that it's love man
Kenneth ``Babyface'' Edmonds who creates the eerie backdrop. From
there, Pink harnesses her thin but malleable vocals to an album of
fiery declarations (``Hell Wit Ya''), slowing only occasionally
into the slinky ``Let Me Let You Know'' and ``Stop Falling.''
Altogether, this lyrically theatrical and slickly produced debut is
a ride more suitable for the screen than any amusement park.

<P>
   Unlike so many six-string heroes who attack guitars, Stevie Ray
Vaughan could caress his instrument and still come up with a
monster sound. The latest posthumous release from the SRV vaults is
all caress, billed as a ``slow blues'' compilation by the label.
That, unfortunately, also suggests ``dull,'' but if there's one
thing the new CD proves, it's that Vaughan was often at his
sharpest when he could stop and smell the rosy notes coming from
his guitar. In many ways, Vaughan's ``slower'' guitarwork was his
most intense. On ``Ain't Gone 'n' Give Up on Love,'' for instance,
he's an emotional wreck. While ``Blues at Sunrise'' may leave one
wondering if the vaults are almost empty, this shouldn't undermine
its value. It's more for the SRV novices and not the diehards.

 &HT;    Big rapper's `Baby' makes for a supple swan song
 &HT;    By Sonia Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Two months ago, Big Pun passed away a heavyweight in hip-hop,
and only partly because the 28-year-old was somewhere between 450
and 700 pounds when he died of natural causes. There was something
remarkable about a guy of his girth being able to rhyme with such
lilt and his playful insistence that though he was big, he was
still sexy, was nothing short of enigmatic. And convincing.
</P>
<P>
   Big Pun (born Christopher Rios) recorded only one album before
this parting effort. But the Grammy-nominated CD ``Capital
Punishment,'' released in 1998, was enough to make him the first
Latino rapper to sell a million copies. And compared to this
follow-up, it is the better of the two. Not that ``Yeeeah Baby''
doesn't find him as limber with a lyric _ particularly on the
Southern-flavored ``We Don't Care.'' His team-up with R&AMP;B singer
Donell Jones on ``It's So Hard'' approaches the catchiness of Pun's
breakthrough collaboration with R&AMP;B's Joe, ``Still Not a Player.''
And his musical salute to his Puerto Rican roots, ``100%,'' is
certainly danceable.
</P>
<P>
   But scarce is the single that has all three elements.

 &HT;    SCIENCE/HEALTH: Author explores shyness in new book
 &HT;    By Meredith Moss
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ He understands how it feels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a shy adolescent and had almost no dates in high
school,'' admits Bernardo J. Carducci, now a professor of
psychology at Indiana University Southeast in New Albany, Ind. ``I
couldn't talk to girls.''
</P>
<P>
   These days Carducci, 47, is talking to all kinds of people,
especially to those who find shyness a stumbling block in their
daily lives.
</P>
<P>
   He's convinced he can help. As director of the Shyness Research
Institute at his university, Carducci has interviewed thousands of
shy people over the past 25 years. And he has a new book about it,
``Shyness: A Bold New Approach'' (Harper Perennial, $15).
</P>
<P>
   Carducci is quick to point out that shyness is not a disease and
that many of the world's most successful folks have identified
themselves as shy. Cases in point: David Letterman and Eleanor
Roosevelt, Princess Di and Thomas ``Stonewall'' Jackson, Sting and
Barbara Walters.
</P>
<P>
   He's studied every aspect of the topic: shyness on the Internet,
shyness in various cultures, the strategies shy people use to deal
with their fears. Some folks, he says, carry on a normal life at
work, at home and with friends, but have social anxiety _
difficulty making small talk at a cocktail party, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Carducci says about 95 percent of us report feeling shy at one
time or another.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with being shy,'' insists Carducci.
``What you have to do is be able to control your shyness, rather
than having shyness control you.''
</P>
<P>
   His goal is to help others become ``successfully shy'' by
understanding the nature and dynamics of their shyness and then
making decisions based on what they know.
</P>
<P>
   ``For example, shy people need more time to adjust to social
situations,'' he begins. ``We call it the 'slow-to-warm-up'
tendency.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A mistake lots of shy people make is to go to a social
function late because they think it's easier for them to blend in,
or else they show up and give up and leave after 10 minutes if
they're not in the mix.''
</P>
<P>
   These strategies, he says, fail to consider that it takes shy
folks some time to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   A successfully shy person would go to the party early so he or
she can meet people one-on-one before it gets crowded, he says. Or
they might stay at the party for at least a half-hour so there's
time to warm up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do during that time is what I call social
reconnaissance,'' he says. ``Rather than stand around and feel
self-conscious, you circulate around the room noting information
that you can use later when you're ready to start approaching
people.''
</P>
<P>
   Carducci says shy people incorrectly believe everyone else is
watching and judging them.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, that's totally false,'' he says. ``Most people don't
care about you, they care about themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Carducci knows that those who attend his shyness workshops are
unlikely to shout out questions from the get-go.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he'll speak for a while, allowing his audience members
time to warm up and get to know him.
</P>
<P>
   Years of conversations with shy folks have convinced him that
shy people have a hard time making small talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't feel that their opening line is witty enough or
brilliant enough, when in fact, all you have to do is be nice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, this dip is tasty,'' may sound trite, but Carducci says
it does the job _ lets the other person know you are willing to
converse. ``Yes, it is,'' is the only response necessary. It lets
the other person know you're willing to talk, too.
</P>
<P>
   Carducci often consults with the parents of shy children.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them never to ask their child to do something they
aren't willing to do themselves,'' he says. ``Parents will force
their child to play with other children at the park because they
want him to be more outgoing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But are they willing to go to a social function where they
don't know anybody and step forward to initiate conversation?''
</P>
<P>
   He suggests parents provide dress rehearsals for their child's
school work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's say the class will be discussing the presidency or an
upcoming holiday at school,'' he says. ``You can talk about that
subject around the dinner table or while you're going on errands.
It helps them rehearse _ they've already heard themselves discuss
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Carducci says shyness boils down to comfort zones. ``You can
expand your comfort zone,'' he insists. ``Rather than going to the
same place again and again, try to go someplace new.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's your child who is shy, begin by inviting other
children to your house, then take them all to the park.''
</P>
<P>
   Carducci loves talking to shy people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I study shyness, the more complex and interesting I
find it,'' he says. ``Shy people have a lot to say. People just
don't take the time to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   FACTS ABOUT SHYNESS
</P>
<P>
   _ Shy children are not destined to be shy adults.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shyness does not equal low self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   _ Shyness is not a disease, personality deficit or character
flaw.
</P>
<P>
   _ Humans aren't the only ones to experience shyness; scientists
have been studying shy cats, shy fish and shy dogs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Some of the world's most famous, richest, smartest and bravest
people are shy.
</P>
<P>
   TIPS ON PARENTING SHY CHILDREN:
</P>
<P>
   _ Be mindful of the slow warm-up period. Don't force shy
children into noisy or chaotic environments. Ease them into
situations that you believe they may reject, and take it one step
at a time. Be patient.
</P>
<P>
   _ Set an example. If you back away from social commitments, your
child will sense your anxiety. By your actions, show him that
others are friendly and can be trusted. Entertain in your home, and
maintain friendships with extended family and friends. Involve your
child in your errands, socializing and community events.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't overprotect your child. Don't let her feel that she
can't do something because she is ``shy.'' Make sure that she has
opportunities to interact with other children.
</P>
<P>
   _ Communicate with your child. Tell him about your own
experiences and let him learn from your mistakes. Explain the
benefits of friendship, help him understand his feelings, prepare
him for upcoming events and together choose appropriate activities
for his temperament.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prepare your child. Give her advance notice if your family
routines are about to change. Help her anticipate what the expect.
Talk about upcoming events _ from car pools to birthday parties _
so she won't feel surprised.
</P>
<P>
   _ Prepare others. If it takes a few extra minutes for your child
to get used to other adults, explain to them that he is sensitive
and requires a little more time to warm up. Ask for their patience
in gaining his trust.
</P>
<P>
   _ Don't label your child or assume she has a serious emotional
or developmental problem.
</P>
<P>
   Help children understand how to get over their fears and doubts.
Labeling creates self-fulfilling prophecies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Love your child for who he is, not who you want him to be.
Children don't fail, they only fail to meet their parents'
unrealistic expectations. Try to understand your child's
experiences from his point of view and talk through his troubles.
</P>
<P>
   _ Rather than isolating and protecting children, love and
encourage them. Overall, temperamentally inhibited children need to
expand their comfort zones by slowly developing trust in
themselves, their playmates and the widening world.

 &HT;    Military courts set the stage for high drama
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement,'' with Samuel L. Jackson on trial after a
Marine Corps rescue goes bad (it opens Friday in metro Atlanta), is
part of a long, proud tradition of military courtroom dramas.
Consider these predecessors for your own at-home ``Please Rise''
festival. Remember these are military trials, so don't look here
for ``To Kill a Mockingbird'' or ``Inherit the Wind.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``A Few Good Men'': Callow young lieutenant Tom Cruise and his
superior officer, Demi Moore, go mano a mano (so to speak) against
Jack Nicholson (left) as a hard-bitten Navy colonel in charge of a
U.S. base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The case concerns a high-level
court-martial inquiry into the hazing death of a Marine private.
The director is Rob Reiner, but, perhaps more importantly, the
writer is Aaron Sorkin (the man behind television's ``The West
Wing.'') The line everyone remembers is when a bull-necked
Nicholson turns on his adversaries and snarls, ``You can't handle
the truth.'' On-set, however, Nicholson was anything but
bull-necked. His younger cast mates were astonished by his
cooperation. According to Reiner, he delivered his two-page
courtroom speech at least 50 times in one day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Judgement at Nuremburg'':
</P>
<P>
   An impressive cast presided over by Judge Spencer Tracy tackles
the Nazi war crimes tribunal in this justly famous film directed by
Stanley Kramer. Maxmilian Schell won an Oscar, as did screenwriter
Abby Mann. The most unforgettable performances, however, come from
a triumvirate of old pros: Marlene Dietrich, Montgomery Clift and
Judy Garland. Garland's performance was especially remarkable. She,
like Clift, played an emotionally disturbed survivor of the Third
Reich's brutality. Her only problem was that, on the first day, it
took six takes for her to summon up the required tears. She
explained to Kramer, ``Damn it, Stanley. I can't do it. I'm too
happy today to cry.'' But she managed, and, tears or no tears, also
managed a best supporting actress Oscar nomination.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Sergeant Rutledge'': Directed by John Ford, it's based on an
original story called ``Buffalo Soldier,'' which was the Indian
term for the African-American soldiers in the 9th and 10th Cavalry,
most of them former slaves. The name came from their ability to
hide in the snow under buffalo skins. The highest rank a buffalo
soldier could reach was sergeant; all the higher leadership was
white. The plot concerns the court-martial of a sergeant (Woody
Strode) for alleged rape (and worst, miscegenation), flashing back
and forth between the trial and Rutledge's heroic career. The
moguls at Warner's wanted Sidney Poitier or Harry Belafonte in the
title role, but Ford insisted that they weren't ``tough enough.''
Instead he hired Strode, a former UCLA football player and sometime
professional wrestler.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Caine Mutiny'': Based on Herman Wouk's Pulitzer
Prize-winning novel, it involves naval officer Captain Queeg
(Humphrey Bogart), who's beginning to crack up. During a typhoon,
he's relieved of command by a subordinate, an action that results
in a military trial. Van Johnson is fine as the upright Navy man
doing what he thinks is his duty, and Fred MacMurray is more than
fine as the weaselly officer who goads Johnson into action. But the
movie belongs to Jose Ferrer, as the lawyer for the defense, and to
Bogart, twitching and curling his lip and playing with those darn
steel balls as if his life depended on it. Asked by a friend how he
got a certain manic, paranoid look in his eyes, Bogart replied,
``Easy. I'm nuts, you know.''

 &HT;    Roasting suits fruits, veggies as well as meats
 &HT;    By Betty Parham

<TEXT>
<P>
   The next few weeks may be a good time to get in some roasting
before the summer heat sets in and the oven takes a vacation.
</P>
<P>
   While other cooking methods like sauteing, baking, frying and
steaming all impart a distinct flavor and quality, many think that
the elemental alchemy that takes place when food is roasted is
unsurpassed.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard not to get spectacular results when roasting beef,
chicken and pork, but roasting also enriches the flavor of
vegetables and fruits that can be incorporated into lighter
springtime fare such as soups, salads and desserts.
</P>
<P>
   Tomatoes, potatoes, peppers, onions, carrots, mushrooms and corn
all take on a richness that cannot be accomplished by any other
method.
</P>
<P>
   Sliced bananas, caramel sauce and a dash of rum can be
transformed into a spectacular dessert after a few minutes in a hot
oven, then topped with chopped nuts.

   SOUP
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Onion and Leek Soup With Gruyere and Parmesan Croutes
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings Preparation time: 15-20 minutes Cooking time: 1
hour, 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   A soup for all seasons, this one's savory onion flavor is
touched by sweetness of the leeks. The onions should roast only
until golden; you do not want them to singe around the edges, which
would add a burned flavor to the stock.
</P>
<P>
   For the soup:
</P>
<P>
   3 pounds onions, sliced 1/2 inch thick
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds leeks, washed, white and light green parts cut into
1-inch pieces
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry white wine
</P>
<P>
   6 to 8 cups homemade or canned beef stock, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 sprig fresh thyme, or 1 teaspoon dried, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 bay leaf
</P>
<P>
   For the Gruyere and Parmesan Croutes:
</P>
<P>
   12 slices Italian or French bread, cut 1/2 inch thick on the
diagonal
</P>
<P>
   2 large garlic cloves, halved
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup grated Gruyere cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 425 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   In a large roasting pan, toss the onions and leeks with the oil
and season with salt and pepper to taste. Roast, stirring often,
for 30 minutes or until the onions are golden but not crispy.
Transfer to a large soup pot. Pour the wine into the roasting pan.
Bring to a boil over high heat on the stovetop, scraping up the
browned bits. Boil for 1 minute, then add to the onions and leeks.
</P>
<P>
   Add 6 cups of the stock, the thyme, bay leaf and salt and pepper
to taste. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 30
minutes to concentrate the flavors, adding some or all of the
remaining 2 cups stock as needed if the soup becomes too thick.
Remove and discard the thyme sprig, if used, and the bay leaf.
</P>
<P>
   For the croutes: Reduce oven heat to 400 degrees. Rub both sides
of each slice of bread with the garlic and brush with oil. Arrange
slices on a baking sheet and bake, turning once, for 7 minutes
total, or until lightly toasted. Spoon some of both cheeses over
each slice and bake for 3 to 4 minutes more or until the cheeses
are melted. Serve at once.
</P>
<P>
   To serve: Ladle soup into heated bowls and top each with a hot
cheese croute. From: ``Reasons to Roast'' by Georgia Chan Downard
and Evie Righter (Houghton Mifflin, $15)
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Roasted Scallops With Leeks and Fennel
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 30-35 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 13-15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This dinner party dish is great served with green-and-white
fettuccine. Avoid bay scallops: They are too small to withstand the
high heat of roasting and will turn into unappealing little
pellets.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup julienned well-washed leeks
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup julienned fennel bulb
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup julienned carrot
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   Salt and freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1 cup well-drained diced roasted red bell peppers
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup diced pitted kalamata olives
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons minced fresh basil or parsley, divided
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 pounds sea scallops, rinsed and patted dry, muscle removed
if necessary and halved if large
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 450 degrees. Lightly oil an 8-by-10-inch gratin
dish.
</P>
<P>
   In a medium saucepan, heat oil over medium-high heat until hot.
Add the leeks, fennel, carrot, garlic, salt and pepper to taste.
Cook, covered, for 5 minutes or until the vegetables soften.
Transfer the vegetables to a bowl and stir in the red peppers,
olives and 2 tablespoons of the basil or parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Arrange half the mixture in the gratin dish; arrange the
scallops in a single layer on the vegetables, and sprinkle with
salt and pepper to taste. Top with the remaining vegetable mixture.
</P>
<P>
   Roast for 8 to 10 minutes or until the scallops are firm but
still springy to the touch.
</P>
<P>
   With a slotted spoon, divide the scallops and vegetables among
heated serving plates and sprinkle a little of the remaining
tablespoon of fresh basil or parsley over each serving.

FOR ROMANCE AUTHOR NORA ROBERTS, WRITING IS ULTIMATE PASSION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It took a blizzard for Nora Roberts to find her calling. Trapped
in her Maryland home by a snowstorm, Roberts, a 29-year-old
homemaker, was at the end of her rope. Her two kids, ages 2 and 5,
were climbing the walls, and their mother wasn't feeling too calm,
either.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to do something or go crazy,'' she says. ``So I sat down
to write a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Few young mothers would choose such a daunting endeavor to keep
from going loco, but for Roberts, who had no previous writing
experience, it worked. In between feeding and cleaning up after the
kids, she wrote _ until the snow had melted and her story was
finished, both in just a matter of days. The romance novel, which
she titled ``Irish Thoroughbred,'' was good enough to arouse the
interest of an agent, and so Roberts immediately started another
book, always working with a basic plot concept but never a detailed
outline.
</P>
<P>
   The first novel sold to Silhouette, a romance paperback
publisher, as did the second, ``Blithe Images.''
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, Roberts was a hot commodity in the publishing world.
``I figured I was on to something,'' she says. ``By the time the
kids were old enough for school, I had a writing routine going.''
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years and 132 books (yes, you read that right) later,
Roberts has not abandoned her original pattern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Come up with an idea, start playing `what if,' and keep
working until it's done,'' she says. ``There's no magic involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics would simply say there's no challenge involved in
writing romance novels, but Roberts, now 49, is determined to prove
the naysayers wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carolina Moon'' (Putnam, $24.95), her current bestseller, is
her latest attempt to move beyond formula romance writing. Roberts
says she enjoys the challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's better than any other job,'' she says. ``I get to work at
home, and I don't have to wear pantyhose. People say I do it for
the money. Let's get real. By now, money is what I've got. Does
that mean I should retire or write less?''
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, she just loves to write.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get inspiration from things in my own life,'' she admits,
citing her second husband, a handsome carpenter she met when she
needed someone to build some bookshelves.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts describes writing as ``the good part'' of her work.
Publicity tours, with their dual responsibilities of meeting fans
and members of the press, are love/hate affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``What really means a lot to me are the personal connections I
make at book signings,'' Roberts says. ``I never get over being
pleased when somebody says, `I love your books.' Dealing with fans
is not a chore.''
</P>
<P>
   Dealing with the press, however, is.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of times, the person asking the questions hasn't even
read my latest book, or maybe any of my books,'' she says. ``It's
hit or miss whether you get fair treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts says her audience consists primarily of women, including
teen-agers, homemakers, working women and academics. But she hopes
to narrow the gender gap and attract more male readers, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no reason men can't enjoy the kind of people I write
about _ strong women, but strong men, too,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   After conquering the romance genre, Roberts decided to expand
her repertoire to reach a broader audience. Putnam, the publishing
home of Tom Clancy and Patricia Cornwell, took her on, but they
didn't want her to tone down the romantic themes of her tales. So,
sticking with the familiar, she simply began to flesh out
characters and plots more. ``Honest Illusions'' was her first
Putnam title in 1992; she still turns out several, less
research-intensive romance titles for Silhouette each year.
</P>
<P>
   ```Carolina Moon' is an example of how I still write,'' Roberts
says. ``I never write from outlines. I'm terrible at that. I can't
do it. I take a basic idea and see where it goes. This time I knew
I wanted a Southern canvas, a small town in the South. I wanted a
man in a traditional profession for one hero _ I chose a cotton
farmer. I started researching cotton farming, which I knew nothing
about, and learned about organic cotton _ so that gave a modern man
a modern approach to cotton farming.''
</P>
<P>
   Working six to eight hours a day, Roberts eventually crafted the
love story of Tory Bodeen and Cade Lavelle, childhood friends
reunited in Progress, S.C., where Tory fled after playing an
unwitting role in the death of Cade's little sister, Hope. The real
killer has been lurking in Progress ever since, and Tory's
reappearance is a signal for more murder. Though it received
lukewarm reviews, ``Carolina Moon'' debuted in February at No. 3 on
The New York Times bestseller list, and has been in the top 10 ever
since.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such success, Roberts still can't seem to slow down. She
says that Putnam is concerned that if she continues to write at
such a prolific pace, her books may cannibalize each other, with
sales of one book hurting sales of another that's in simultaneous
release.
</P>
<P>
   In response, she hasn't cut back her workload _ she's just taken
on a new name. Roberts is now publishing a series of paperback
mystery novels (''Witness in Death,'' ``Naked in Death'') under the
pen name of J.D. Robb.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to keep writing,'' Roberts says. ``I never take success
for granted. So being J.D. Robb is a way to keep the publisher
happy and me happy, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts jokes that during her promotional tours, fans always
want to suggest story ideas to her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them that if they have a good idea they should write
books themselves,'' Roberts says. ``Look, I did it that way, and it
worked for me.''
</P>
<P>
   And, out of 134 titles, which is her favorite?
</P>
<P>
   ``The one that's on sale right now, honey,'' Roberts says,
laughing. ``That's always going to be true.''

 &HT;    Going with the grain for good health
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The late Bert Greene must have had a grandmother like mine. In
his ``The Grains Cookbook'' (Workman, 1988) he attributes the quote
about good things ``keeping their intentions to themselves'' to his
grandmother, just as I often heard it from mine.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, his only prerequisite for recipes in the book was that
they taste good. That is the best rule of thumb to follow with
whole grains. The different grains offer so many different textures
and tastes. As I chose recipes to try, I looked for other flavors I
knew I would enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   Though unfamiliar with millet, I knew I liked hot and spicy.
Waldorf salad has always been a favorite, so I decided to try the
wheatberries version _ hey, if I didn't like it, I could just eat
the apples. Of course I did like it, as well as the other dishes
below. I think they are good ones to start with. When you are ready
for more, consider finding Greene's book or consulting these
sources:

</P>
<P>
   Starting from the outside of the kernel, grains are made up of a
protective fibrous hull called the bran, then the starchy endosperm
and at the heart the germ. In the refining process, we lose the
bran, which contains most of the minerals, fiber and much of the
riboflavin inherent in grains. The oil-rich germ, which can quickly
turn rancid, is frequently removed as well. What we end up eating
is the starchy middle. Although lost nutrients are added to refined
grains through enrichments, whole grains retain more fiber and
trace minerals, which is why they're considered nutritionally
superior.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Selecting: Buy 1-pound bags of grains you use only
occasionally and replace frequently. When buying grains and their
flours from bins, make sure they have a nice, fresh smell and have
not turned rancid.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Storing: Store in tightly covered glass jars in a cool place.
Whole and cracked grains will keep three to four months. Flours and
meals should be kept in the refrigerator or freezer and used within
two months.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Soaking: Like beans, large grains and short-grain brown rice
cook more quickly and are more easily digested if soaked before
cooking. Although this is not entirely necessary, soaking them in
cool water anywhere from one hour to overnight does help soften
them.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Cooking: A 2-quart saucepan with a tight-fitting lid is ample
for cooking 1 to 2 cups of raw grains. A nonstick surface makes it
easier to clean the pans. Cooking time varies by grain. After the
grains have cooked, let them stand for 5 to 10 minutes to continue
absorbing moisture. To produce fluffy, separate grains, put a clean
towl under the lid once they've finished cooking, then let stand.

<P>
   Whole Wheat Bread
</P>
<P>
   Makes 1 loaf (about 16 slices)
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Kneading time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Rising time: 3 hours, 45 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 45-60 minutes
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to include more whole grains in my diet, I went on
a search for a good recipe for homemade whole wheat bread. I tried
several (including a recipe for whole wheat biscuits that I sent on
to the secretary of defense.)
</P>
<P>
   Keep in mind that I'm not a practiced bread baker to begin with.
I've learned that whole wheat baking is tricky because the flour
doesn't have as high a gluten content as white flours. Getting the
dough to rise can be tricky.
</P>
<P>
   Through my trials, I'd say the single most important thing I
learned is to use freshly ground whole wheat flour. Luckily,
Harry's now offers hard red spring wheat you can grind and take
home.
</P>
<P>
   If you can't find freshly ground whole wheat flour, find some
that specifies that it's whole wheat bread flour. Use that in this
recipe from ``The Laurel's Kitchen Bread Book'' (Random House, $21)
and you should succeed. This makes the best breakfast toast!
</P>
<P>
   6 tablespoons warm water
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon active dry yeast
</P>
<P>
   3 cups whole wheat bread flour
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup cold yogurt
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup hot tap water
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons oil
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 tablespoons honey
</P>
<P>
   Vegetable shortening for greasing pan
</P>
<P>
   Warm a china cup by rinsing it with hot water, then measure the
warm water into it. The water should be between 105 degrees and 115
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle yeast into the water while stirring with a spoon.
</P>
<P>
   Combine the flour and salt in a large mixing bowl and stir
lightly.
</P>
<P>
   Put the yogurt in your liquid measuring cup and add the hot tap
water to make a full cup total.
</P>
<P>
   Mix in the oil and honey.
</P>
<P>
   Make a well in the center of the dry ingredients and pour in the
wet ingredients and the yeast mixture. Begin stirring from the
center outward until mixture is well-combined. Turn the dough out
of the bowl onto a kneading surface and knead for 300 substantial
strokes, or about 10 minutes. (You may use a food processor or
mixer. Kneading time will be slightly less than 10 minutes.)
</P>
<P>
   Shape the dough into a smooth round and put it seam side down in
a large bowl. Cover it snugly with plastic wrap. Allow to rise in a
warm area (about 80 degrees) free of drafts. (I usually put my
dough in an unheated oven.) Allow to rise in a warm, dry place for
2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Poke a hole in the middle of the dough; if the side does not
collapse in, deflate the dough by gently pressing from the center
outward. Once it is deflated, tear away from sides of bowl and
shape into a small round again. Allow the dough to rise for 1 hour.
</P>
<P>
   Deflate the dough again, round it and let sit for 10 minutes.
Prepare an 8-by-4-inch loaf pan by thoroughly greasing it with
vegetable shortening. Then shape the dough into a loaf and put in
pan. Allow to rise in a warm, dry place for 45 minutes. (Not the
oven this time, since it needs to preheat.)
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Once bread has risen and the oven
is ready, bake for 45 minutes to an hour. Check at 30 minutes to
see how brown and firm the bread is. Check again at 45 minutes. Tap
the top of the loaf; when you hear a hollow sound, the bread is
done.

   Quinoa is one of the fastest-cooking grains, so it fits in with
busy lifestyles. I like to place a small poached salmon fillet atop
a bed of this crunchy, curried dish.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons canola oil or butter
</P>
<P>
   1 onion, a quarter finely diced, the remaining coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 cup quinoa, thoroughly rinsed
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons curry powder, divided
</P>
<P>
   3/4 teaspoon salt, divided
</P>
<P>
   2 zucchini, diced into small cubes
</P>
<P>
   1 cup carrot juice
</P>
<P>
   1 cup peas
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup thinly sliced green onions, including a little of the
greens
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup cashews, roasted and coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons chopped cilantro
</P>
<P>
   Heat half the oil in a small soup pot, add the finely diced
onion and cook over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Stir in the
quinoa, 1/2 teaspoon curry powder and 1/4 teaspoon salt and cook
for 2 minutes. Add 2 cups boiling water, then lower the heat. Cover
and cook for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heat the remaining tablespoon oil in a 10-inch
skillet. Add the chopped onion, zucchini and remaining 1 1/2
teaspoons curry powder. Cook, stirring frequently, over medium heat
for five minutes. Add 1/2 cup water, the carrot juice and 1/2
teaspoon salt. Cover and simmer for 5 minutes, then add the peas
and green onions and cook for a few minutes more. Stir the
vegetables into the quinoa, then add cashews. Taste for salt and
season with pepper. Allow to cook for another 5 minutes over low
heat. Then remove from heat and serve in soup plates. Garnish with
cilantro or mint. From: ``Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone,''

   Vegetarian cookbook author Deborah Madison calls this dish and
other variations of eggs and rice ``wholesome fast food.'' We'd add
``delicious.'' The rice takes time to cook, but it's unattended
time. Once it's ready, this meal is done in a flash. Try other
variations, too, like pesto or grated provolone, roasted peppers or
peas. This is a new regular at my house.
</P>
<P>
   1 1/2 cups brown rice
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   2 bunches mustard greens, stems removed
</P>
<P>
   1 large garlic clove, minced or pressed
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 or 2 eggs, beaten
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup toasted chopped walnuts
</P>
<P>
   Pecorino romano cheese
</P>
<P>
   for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Boil the rice in salted water until tender, 30 to 45 minutes,
depending on whether it's long- or short-grain. Meanwhile, cook the
greens in 2 quarts salted boiling water until tender, 5 to 7
minutes. Drain, then press out the liquid and coarsely chop them.
Toss the greens with the garlic and oil and season with salt and
pepper to taste. When the rice is done (drain if needed, then
return to the pot), rapidly stir in the eggs until rice is
well-coated (rice and pan should still be hot). If you work
quickly, the egg will cook evenly and be invisible except for its
shine. Add the greens and walnuts and toss again. Serve with a
light coating of grated pecorino cheese. From: ``Vegetarian Cooking

   Of all the grains I tried for this story, I was most unfamiliar
with millet. So I chose this spicy recipe, thinking it would be
hard to go wrong. I was right. It made an excellent side to a small
steak. To make this a main dish, mix in some cooked chopped
chicken.
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup millet
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, minced
</P>
<P>
   2 large cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 small green bell pepper, cored, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1 large red bell pepper, cored, seeded and minced
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped roasted sweet red peppers (fresh or from a
jar)
</P>
<P>
   1 1/4 cups vegetable or chicken stock or canned broth
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon hot chili oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon dark sesame oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   Chopped fresh parsley for garnish
</P>
<P>
   Place the millet in a large heavy skillet and stir over
medium-high heat until the seeds turn golden, about 5 minutes. The
millet will pop slightly as it browns. Remove from heat. Heat the
oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion; cook 1
minute. Add the garlic and both bell peppers; cook 2 minutes.
Sprinkle with sugar and stir in the millet, sweet peppers and
chicken stock. Heat to boiling. Reduce heat, cover and cook over
medium-low heat until the millet is tender and all liquid has been
absorbed, 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Stir in the chili oil, vinegar and sesame oil. (If you are
serving with chopped chicken, spoon it over the millet.) Remove the
pan from the heat and let it stand, covered, 10 minutes. Then fluff
the millet with a fork, season with salt, sprinkle with parsley and
serve. From: ``The Grains Cookbook,'' Bert Greene (Workman

   Armenian Style Chicken With Bulgur
</P>
<P>
   Makes 4 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 10 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 1 hour and 25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   This Turkish-inspired dish is hearty and exotic, with whiffs of
peppers and honey. Walnuts add crunch to the sweet bulgur. This
would be delicious with just chicken thighs and legs, if you don't
want to do a whole chicken.
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons olive oil
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon unsalted butter
</P>
<P>
   1 chicken (about 3 pounds), cut into serving pieces
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme (or 1/4 teaspoon dried)
</P>
<P>
   1 medium onion, chopped
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, minced
</P>
<P>
   1 small hot red pepper, seeded, deveined and minced
</P>
<P>
   2 cups chicken stock or canned broth
</P>
<P>
   1 cup bulgur
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup broken walnut pieces
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon honey
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh mint
</P>
<P>
   1 teaspoon chopped fresh basil
</P>
<P>
   Heat the oil with the butter in a large cast-iron skillet over
medium heat. Sprinkle the chicken pieces with the salt, pepper and
thyme and saute a few pieces at a time until golden brown, about 10
minutes. Transfer the pieces to a plate as they are done.
</P>
<P>
   Remove all but 1 tablespoon fat from skillet. Add the onion and
cook over medium-low heat, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan
for 2 minutes. Add the garlic and hot pepper; cook 4 minutes
longer. Return the chicken pieces to the skillet, stir in the stock

   Using tongs, remove the chicken pieces to a plate. Stir the
bulgur into the cooking juices and add the walnuts and honey. Mix
well and return the chicken pieces. Continue to cook, covered,

skillet stand, covered, for 10 minutes. Before serving, fluff the
bulgur with a fork and sprinkle with the mint and basil. From:

<P>
   It was every daughter's nightmare. Last February, Judy Spiegal's
father had a heart attack and was found to have severe heart
disease. For three weeks, Spiegal, 43 a freelance marketer from
Marlboro, N.J., found herself shuttling between the hospital and
her home. Increasingly exhausted, she turned for solace to the
usual sources: her husband, daughter, friends and rabbi.
</P>
<P>
   But Spiegal also found herself seeking the support of strangers.
After a friend told her about a religious Web site called
Beliefnet, Spiegal, a Reform Jew, logged on and started a virtual
prayer circle for her father. The first day, a dozen people of
different faiths posted prayers, some anonymously.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got support from people all over the country,'' she said.
``In between my visits to the hospital, I would log on to read the
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has transformed investing and shopping, and now it
is having an effect on how people practice their faith. A 1998
study by the Barna Research Group estimated that of the 100 million
Americans online, 25 percent used the Internet for ``religious
purposes'' each month, mainly to communicate with others via e-mail
or chat roooms about religious ``ideas, beliefs or experiences.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious sites abound on the Web, encompassing everything from
modest home pages of local churches and synagogues to ambitious,
venture-capital-backed religious portals like Beliefnet
(www.beliefnet.com) and the forthcoming Faith.com and Spirit
Channel.com, which hope to attract people from across the spiritual
spectrum.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a way, our site is not all that different than the sex
sites on the Web,'' said Steve Waldman, 37, a journalist who
started Beliefnet in January. ``Religion is really important to
people the way sex is. The anonymity of the Web leads to
intimacy.'' That intimacy, he said, fosters discussion.
</P>
<P>
   To hear boosters like Waldman tell it, Web sites like Beliefnet
are simply the next step in the democratization of religion, a
process that began with the printing of the Gutenberg Bible six
centuries ago. But you have to wonder: Is the Internet, a medium
not exactly known for rewarding long attention spans, an
appropriate venue for meaningful religious exploration? Is a 56K
modem consistent with the staples of real-life religious practice,
like singing and praying with others?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think any religious site is going to replace religion,
but the Internet is accelerating changes that are already
happening'' in American religious life, said Don Lattin, co-author
of ``Shopping for Faith: Religion in the New Millennium''
(Jossey-Bass, 1998) and a longtime religion reporter for The San
Francisco Chronicle. ``People are paying more attention to their
own personal spiritual quests, and this contributes to the
breakdown of institutions. People are linking up with other
denominations. For example, if someone is gay, they might choose a
denomination that accepted gays. It is said we are in a
postdenominational era.''
</P>
<P>
   Tom Beaudoin, a Catholic theologian and the author of ``Virtual
Faith: The Irreverent Spiritual Quest of Generation X''
(Jossey-Bass, 1998), said: ``The Internet is an invitation for
people who are skeptical. They feel released and can ask the
religious questions they want to explore. I've received e-mails at
3 a.m. from people who haven't stepped inside a church in years.''
</P>
<P>
   As one half of an interfaith couple, Lance Fritter, 35, a
computer scientist from Germantown, Md., has been active in
religious discussion groups online for years. When Fritter
discovered Beliefnet, he joined discussion groups about
intermarriage, agnosticism, and religion and science. But he
avoided the prayer circles. ``I guess they are good for some
people,'' he said. ``For some people, I imagine it's a real turnoff
because prayer is so personal.''
</P>
<P>
   But for some seekers, a site like Beliefnet is a place to work
through a personal crisis, either by joining a prayer circle, as
Judy Spiegal did, or even erecting a virtual memorial to a deceased
loved one. (Not all calls for prayer are of the life-and-death
variety. One woman on Beliefnet simply asked for prayers because
her Realtor was being ``pushy.'' She wrote: ``I can't take it
anymore. I need God's help to get me through this.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a colleague whose wife died and he created a Web page in
her honor,'' said Jeffrey Hadden, a professor of sociology at the
University of Virginia and founder of a scholarly Web site about
religious movements (www.religiousmovements.org). ``I felt
squeamish about it because I wouldn't want to share my grief with
the whole world. But I was wrong. It really helped him mourn her.''
</P>
<P>
   Some critics argue that sites like Beliefnet cast such a wide
net _ there is information on roughly 50 religions _ that they are
trying to be all things to all people, and in the process give only
cursory attention to any one faith. Faith.com, which is set to go
into operation this spring, will be made up of seven portals,
covering a total of 172 denominations, said Pamela Meyer, the
site's founder.
</P>
<P>
   Like Beliefnet, Faith.com will have a discussion areas and a
commerce component. It will rely mostly on user-generated content
like prayers and reviews of books, movies and videos. Visitors will
also have access to an audio and video library where they can
download sermons and videos of, say, a well-known spiritual writer
speaking on a topic like forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   Beaudoin, the theologian and author, is troubled by multifaith
sites, saying they contribute to the ``menuification'' of religion.
``They give the appearance that religious identity is about
choosing what's right for you,'' he said. ``Personal choice is
important, but what about your responsibility to a particular
tradition?''
</P>
<P>
   The Spirit Channel aims to go beyond the multifaith concept to
embrace all aspects of religion, New Age spirituality, holistic
health and even the paranormal. The brainchild of Issac Tiggret,
founder of the Hard Rock Cafe and the House of Blues, Spirit
Channel wants to become the ``first holistic lifestyle brand,'' a
press release says.
</P>
<P>
   Tiggret wants to sell spirituality the way he sold rock
memorabilia and the blues. While the site has presented Webcasts
like the Gathering of World Religions last December, it is still
under construction and is scheduled to be fully functioning
sometime this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 1980s and 1990s saw the rise of convenience religion _
churches and synagogues accommodating overscheduled congregants
with innovations like Wednesday night services and on-site child
care. With the Internet, convenience religion is going a step
further. Beliefnet posts daily, nondenominational, guided
mediations, a spiritual exercise that its founder, Waldman, argues
is well suited for the Internet because it can be ``sandwiched
between meetings.''

 &HT;    Climb out of your fluffy white-flour-things rut and add some
variety with healthier whole grains
 &HT;    By Reagan Walker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   An old saying suggests things that are good for you ``should
keep the secret of their good intentions strictly to themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Or put another way: ``Whatever you do, don't call something
healthy,'' said Andrew Weil, a doctor and author of health books,
in a recent interview. ``It will be the kiss of death.''
</P>
<P>
   Because we've come to praise whole grains rather than bury them,
we'll save the health news for a little later.
</P>
<P>
   First, savor the nuttiness of brown rice mixed with some pungent
greens, an egg, minced garlic, toasted walnuts and grated pecorino
cheese _ a new comfort food standard.
</P>
<P>
   Or allow a bowl of crunchy quinoa (pronounced keen-WAH) to soak
up some curry, and then mix with cashews and peas for an exotic
side dish to fish. Then try giving the Waldorf salad new vibrancy
with some springy, yummy wheat berries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are fortunate in this country to have access to grains from
all over the world,'' said Vivian Gold, a team member at Whole
Foods grocery store in Atlanta, as she stood before a row of bins
filled with barley and buckwheat, quinoa and millet. ``But we don't
take advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   That's because Americans are in a ``fluffy white things'' rut,
as Weil refers to products made with white flour.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether it is shaped into rolls, muffins or pizza crusts;
baked into pretzels or crackers; fortified with vitamins and
minerals or mixed with flours of other grains, these white-flour
products are all the same _ one of the unhealthiest creations of
food technology,'' Weil wrote in his latest book, ``Eating Well for
Optimum Health'' (Knopf, $25).
</P>
<P>
   Weil's concern with refined white flour products is that they
offer relatively little nutritionally and convert into blood sugar
quickly, provoking an insulin response. This can be a factor in
obesity and diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   What concerns Kathleen Zelman, Marietta, Ga., nutritionist and
local spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association, is that
refined white flour doesn't provide the fiber folks need, much less
the other nutrients whole grains offer.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of whole grains have been touted for years. But
just last year, the federal government approved label claims for
whole grain foods that states: ``Diets rich in whole-grain foods
and other plant foods and low in fat and cholesterol may reduce the
risk of heart disease and certain cancers.''
</P>
<P>
   Zelman said that most adults need at least 25 grams of fiber a
day; children need their age plus 5. The best way to get the
necessary fiber is to eat more whole grains and vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many, the best way to start is with whole-grain cereals,''
said Zelman. Read labels for cereals that include whole wheat or
other grains, such as barley and oats. Switching from white bread
to whole wheat bread is also an easy move. But again, read labels
and make sure breads are 100 percent whole wheat.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, more and more convenience products featuring whole
grains are available in groceries. Tabbouleh mixes, with cracked
wheat, are common now. Mixes for more exotic grains like quinoa are
also on the shelves, offering quick and easy ways to try new
grains. (Seeds of Change is one brand to look for.) Whole-wheat
pastas and Japanese soba noodles (made with buckwheat) are right at
home in speedy weeknight menus.
</P>
<P>
   Restaurants may be a good place to experiment. Cosi in Decatur
offers a monkfish with a barley risotto and roast lamb medallions
with bulgur enhanced with artichokes and eggplant.
</P>
<P>
   In the Shade Cafe, a vegetarian restaurant in Atlanta, offers a
variety of grain dishes, from a wheat berries and carrot terrine to
quinoa stir-fries. ``We mix cooked quinoa in near the end of the
stir-frying process, during the last minute,'' said Brad
Rubenstein. ``It really adds a lot of texture and soaks up the
flavors.''
</P>
<P>
   Once folks have tried convenience products and sampled some
restaurant fare, Zelman urges cooking up one new whole-grain recipe
a week at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average family cook has about eight to 10 recipes _ like
spaghetti, meatloaf and chicken _ that they make over and over
again,'' said Zelman. ``It's time to break out of that comfort zone
and add some variety. And adding whole grains is critical to
protecting your family's health.''
</P>
<P>
   Oops. We hope that health claim wasn't the kiss of death.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, many whole-grain dishes are as tasty as they are good
for you.
</P>
<P>
   And don't think healthy and boring. Think adventurous and
delicious.

 UNDATED: between meetings.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Indeed, convenience is one of the things that Speigal
appreciates about the site. ``Because of the busyness of life,
sometimes you don't get to participate as much as you'd like, ''
she said. ``This way, you're able to turn on the computer and learn
or pray.''
</P>
<P>
   Religious sites like Beliefnet are also instructive, focusing on
ceremonies for rites of passage like marriages and births, and how
to raise a spiritually healthy child. Beliefnet and Ibelieve.com
(www.ibelieve.com), a Christian site, both have entire sections
devoted to child-rearing issues. Faith.com will have a Family
section.
</P>
<P>
   ``I print out articles about marriage and parenting and give
them to my family all the time,'' said Cindy Wenz, 31, of Houston,
who logs on to Ibelieve.com daily, mostly for the articles about
family life. ``They teach me how to relate to my kids in a
Christian way.''
</P>
<P>
   An Ibelieve article suggested that if parents are having a hard
time getting their children to talk to them, they should give the
child a toy to talk to instead so that the child feels less
intimidated. ``My daughter thinks it is silly, but I think the idea
is cute,'' said Wenz, who gave her daughter a stuffed bunny to talk
to. ``I never would have thought of it myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Media Metrix, a company that tracks Internet usage, does not
keep numbers on any religious sites, nor have the Internet research
firms Forrester Research or Jupiter Communications done any studies
on them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, David Card, a Jupiter analyst, said he is ``bullish on
the opportunity'' that sites like Beliefnet have to attract users
because of increased interest in spirituality in general. But he is
not sure that these sites are destined to make any money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marketing on a multifaith site is a challenge because there is
not necessarily affinity among users,'' Card said. ``It would be
much easier to market to people of a particular religion.''
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the sticky question of religious Web sites' trying
to make a profit in the first place. Beliefnet, which is backed by
Highland Capital, a Boston-based venture capital firm that financed
eToys and Lycos, has an online store that sells everything from
Deepak Chopra books to vacation packages to Israel. The store also
sells products that have little to do with religious or spiritual
matters, like cozy wool blankets and aromatherapy oils.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were putting together the store, we were very
conscious that some people might think that religion and commerce
were strange bedfellows,'' said Tony Uphoff, the chief executive of
Beliefnet. ``We try to sell content-driven commerce.'' The company
recently signed with Saatchi &AMP; Saatchi for a $20 million
advertising campaign. So far there are no plans for an initial
public offering.
</P>
<P>
   ``Religion is a topic people are passionate about,'' said Chip
Austin, a managing partner in IHatch, a Manhattan-based venture
capital firm that has provided seed money for Faith.com. ``The raw
size and shape of the religious market and the fact that no one has
really attacked it yet, made Faith.com very interesting to us.''
Faith.com will sell merchandise on its site and provide help for
churches and synagogues who want to establish Web sites through the
Faith.com network.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can wrinkle my nose at the fact that they sell stuff on
these religious sites,'' said Hadden at the University of Virginia.
``But whether we like it or not, commerce is the great success of
the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   The other great success of the Internet is that it connects
people who are far apart. Some congregations are using the Internet
to broaden their reach, much like preachers have traditionally used
radio and television to expand their ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Salem Baptist Church in Chicago (www.sbcoc.org) broadcasts five
services each week over the Internet to accommodate congregants
unable to attend in person. In February, 15 Salem members who were
away at college worshiped from their dorm rooms, said the church's
leader, the Rev. James Meeks. ``My preference is for people to come
to church,'' said Meeks, who presides over a congregation of more
than 10,000. ``But if someone is out of town, ill, working or away
at college, they can still join us. Or they can watch it later at
their own convenience.''
</P>
<P>
   Online services have been incredibly successful at the Cathedral
of Hope in Dallas (www.cathedralofhope.com), which has a gay and
lesbian congregation of about 3,000 members. The church's pastor,
the Rev. Michael Piazza, said that the Internet services allow him
to reach gays and lesbians all over the world, many of whom feel
uncomfortable attending services in person.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet reaches people who have no other church,'' Piazza
said. ``If you live in a small town in east Texas and you're
closeted, where are you going to get community?'' About 500 people
tune in each week for the church's four weekly services. But ``if
online religion is all you have,'' Beaudoin said, ``then you have
an impoverished sense of the religious life. Online religions can
only be a supplement for flesh and blood community.''
</P>
<P>
   Speigal, whose father is now happily settled in a nursing home,
said that she would never use Beliefnet as an alternative to going
to temple, but that ``it does enhance my spiritual life.''

 &HT;    Quick and easy candy simply divine

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ You know that kitchen drawer crammed with booklets and
warranties from electric carving knives, coffeemakers and
refrigerators collected since the day you set up housekeeping? If
you're like me, you believe that the day you throw them out will be
the very day you might need them.
</P>
<P>
   Janet Cornelson of Gainesville, Ga., proves the value of hanging
on, mess notwithstanding. She turned to the circa-1981 recipe
booklet that came with her microwave oven and happily was able to
fulfill Gayle Ledbetter's request for the microwave divinity she
and her sister used to make.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most, this divinity is virtually foolproof and comes out
well no matter what the weather. And it tastes the same and takes
much less time, Cornelson said.
</P>
<P>
   It does contain raw egg whites, though, so you might not want to
serve it to very young children, the elderly or those with weakened
immune systems.

 &HT;    Locate hard to find items

<P>
   Having trouble finding a particular item? We'll try to help you
locate it. But because of the volume of mail, we cannot track down
every request. Readers whose queries are answered in the column
will receive a blue-and-cream canvas Buyer's Edge tote bag. Write
us at Buyer's Edge Find It,The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, P.O.
Box 4689, Atlanta, GA 30302; e-mail us at buyersedge(at)ajc.com

   Q: I am looking for pHisoderm Antibacterial Cleanser.It's in a
white container with a bright blue, green and orange label. I used
to buy it at Wal-Mart, but I can't find it anywhere now.
</P>
<P>
   _ Pam M. Miles, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   Another medicinal question: I have been unable to find
Mercurochrome, an antiseptic that would quickly relieve pain from
cuts or other superficial injuries without stinging. The main
drawback? The skin would be stained red.
</P>
<P>
   _ Barbara Brown, Alpharetta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   And another: I'm looking for merthiolate, a bright orange-red
solution that practically cured anything when I was a kid. This is
not Mercurochrome, which doesn't burn when applied to a wound.
Merthiolate, an antiseptic solution, burns a lot! But if you can
stand it (and my momma made me stand it), it'll heal almost
anything. I haven't see this miracle drug in several years. Can you
find it?
</P>
<P>
   _ Jim Henderson, Decatur, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Often bathroom-cabinet favorites come back in different
guises. Mercurochrome no longer exists but has morphed into
Mercuroclear II, a clear antiseptic that, says the manufacturer,
``helps prevent infection and relieves pain and itching of minor
cuts, burns and insect bites.'' A 1-ounce bottle is $2.99. The
first aid antiseptic merthiolate is no longer red and doesn't sting
but is still used for minor skin irritations. A 1-ounce bottle is
$2.99. Both are at Miller's Rexall Drugs, 87 Broad St.
(404-523-8481).
</P>
<P>
   Reader Miles will soon be washing her hands with pHisoderm
Antibacterial Hand Cleanser. This soap, says manufacturer Chattem,
``kills a wide range of germs hands come in contact with _ without
drying skin.'' A 6-ounce bottle is $2.83, also at Miller's Rexall
Drugs. We also found a 6-ounce bottle ($1.29) at MacFrugal's
Bargains Close-Outs, 2581 Piedmont Road N.E. (404-237-1919).
</P>
<P>
   Q: Recently I moved from New Mexico to Atlanta and have been
unable to find Milkman Instant Lowfat Dry Milk. It's perfect for
camping trips or to keep on hand for emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   _ Bren Goode, Atlanta
</P>
<P>
   A: Touted as having the ``kiss of cream,'' Milkman Instant
Lowfat Dry Milk (four 1-quart envelopes, $2.99) is available at
Publix stores, including locations at 2900 Peachtree Road N.E.,
1544 Piedmont Road N.E., 3200 Holcomb Bridge Road, Norcross, and
3435 Ashford Dunwoody Road N.E.
</P>
<P>
   When mixed with water, Milkman contains 1/2 percent milkfat and
an added touch of cream for taste. And it's a snap to make. Simply
put the contents of one envelope into 1/2 quart of water, stirring
constantly with a spoon. Add water to make a quart, chill and
serve.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for Hard as Nails, which I used to buy in New
York. It worked wonders on strengthening my nails. But I can't find
it here.
</P>
<P>
   _ Darlene Cherry, Buford, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: We nailed down Hard as Nails at Kmart stores and found our
.45-ounce bottle ($2.49) at the 2581 Piedmont Road N.E. location
(404-261-6900). Sally Hansen bills its product as ``the nail clinic
in a bottle!'' Nail edges ``are sealed for added protection against
chipping, cracking and splitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: I am looking for a Fizz-Keeper, a small plastic pump that
screws on 1- or 2-liter bottles of soft drinks. You can pump air
into the bottle to keep it from going flat. I bought the last ones
from Wal-Mart, but my local store does not have them any more.
</P>
<P>
   _ Robert Hendershott, Stone Mountain
</P>
<P>
   A: Put a little fizz back into your soft drinks with the
Fizz-Keeper Pump Cap ($2.49), available at Bed Bath &AMP; Beyond
stores. We found ours at the 1 Buckhead Loop N.E. location
(404-869-0457).
</P>
<P>
   It's also available at Lechters in Market Square for $2.99
(404-325-0358). This gizmo is simple to use. Remove the bottle cap
and screw the Fizz-Keeper on tightly. Pump until the plastic bottle
becomes firm. Unscrew and pour. Note: Do not overpump, and use on
plastic bottles only. It fits 1-, 1.5- and 2-liter bottles.
</P>
<P>
   Q: When I was a little girl in New York, my dad would go into
one of the Swedish neighborhoods and buy a can of ``fiskbullar,'' a
combination of cod and potatoes combined in oval balls. My father
has passed away, but my Uncle Jack, who still lives in New York,
tells me he would love to have ``fiskbullar'' again. If you could
locate this product, we would be most appreciative.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ruth Hayden, Smyrna, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   A: Both you and your Uncle Jack can enjoy this Swedish treat
once again. We found a version of your fish balls at Arctic Circle,
3741 Venture Drive, Duluth (770-495-0222). A 13.2-ounce can of
Abba's Fiskbullar in dill sauce or lobster sauce is $3.25. These
fish balls, which are made from cod and haddock, traditionally are
served warm with boiled potatoes.

DOT.COM BUBBLE BURSTS, BUT IT'S NOT FATAL TO NEW ECONOMY

 By DIANE COYLE  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ Sometimes investors seem even more fickle in their
fashions than teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Microsoft verdict this week, the dot.coms and
other high-technology shares had been falling in price, in the
U.S., U.K. and around the globe. Their extraordinary gains last
winter have been going into reverse for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   So, if there was a bubble in these shares, it has certainly
burst. But the harder question to answer is what real effects this
might have on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Is the New Economy past its sell-by date already, dealt a fatal
blow by the verdict of the U.S. courts on its leading company?
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the charges Microsoft would level against the
U.S. government. But it is wrong. The U.S. Justice Department is
giving the New Economy a new lease of life.
</P>
<P>
   An important reason for the vigor of the American economy in the
past century has been its tough anti-monopoly policies. Tackling
Microsoft's monopoly will stimulate more innovation, more choice
and even lower prices in the high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about last year's stock market boom was that it
channelled vast amounts of cheap finance to start-up companies. It
made possible a surge of investment in new infrastructure and
markets.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear parallel with the railway mania of the mid-19th
century, when investors funded thousands of miles of track that
remain to this day the core of the rail network.
</P>
<P>
   It may become a bit harder now for new companies to raise
finance, if share prices continue to languish and the enthusiasm
for untried businesses dims. Yet investors will continue to look
for high-tech opportunities because that is where the prospects for
future economic growth will lie.
</P>
<P>
   They will become a lot more discriminating about where they put
their money. It will no longer be enough to add a dot.com to the
name of the business to rake in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, drastic falls in share prices could trigger a
slowdown in the economy's growth rate. However, as the Bank of
England and its U.S. counterpart, the Federal Reserve, have been
trying to engineer slower growth, that might be no bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   And looking further into the future, there is no doubt that new
technologies have set in motion a transformation of the economy and
society that has barely begun to take shape _ just as the first
rail companies in the 1840s signalled the beginning of urbanization
and mass production.
</P>
<P>
   The dot.com share bubble has been the first hint of an economic
revolution, not its last hurrah. &QL;

   Olives _ they're not just Thanksgiving finger puppets anymore.
</P>
<P>
   While Heinz and Vlasic are reporting flat pickle sales, olives
are taking up more and more shelf space in supermarkets. And it's
not just those ``awful things from California,'' in the words of
uberchef Stephan Pyles, but exotica from Tunisia and Provence and
Sicily. Oodles and oodles of olives.
</P>
<P>
   ``Olives are going through a renaissance,'' says Marino Garbis,
general manager of West Coast Products, an olive-curing operation
in Orland, Calif., in business since 1937. Garbis sees consumers
being more adventuresome in their olive options.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do specialty olives like Greek olives, wrinkly dry-cured
olives and even sun-dried olives,'' Garbis says. And that doesn't
begin to touch the whole stuffed olive arena that includes fillings
from almonds to habanero peppers.
</P>
<P>
   Call it the sophistication of the American palate _ the same
taste wave that in recent years has brought us bread with character
and coffee with attitude. The ripe black blah tinned olives of
(yes, Stephan) California processors will always be part of the
American relish tray. But other California olive processors are
jumping in with artisanal offerings that are much closer to the
olives of our ancestral roots.
</P>
<P>
   And it's no longer just Italian or Greek or Middle Eastern
specialty stores that stock the little salty fellas. Arlington's
Whole Foods Market artfully displays an ``olive bar,'' a kiosk of a
dozen glistening varieties wisely positioned between the boutique
beers and the cheese bazaar. Austin's Central Market, the Valhallah
of food, offers a range of olives that practically spans the globe.
</P>
<P>
   So, despite its other charms, it's no longer necessary to
preface an olive with a bath of gin and vermouth.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Name that olive
</P>
<P>
   1. French Picholine: smooth, elongated, brine-cured.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jumbo Sicilian: brine-cured, mild.
</P>
<P>
   3. Italian Gaeta: salt-cured, small, black, wrinkled.
</P>
<P>
   4. Greek kalamata: black-purple olives, slit and brine-cured.
</P>
<P>
   5. Spanish Catalan: large, green, brine-cured.
</P>
<P>
   6. Moroccan dry-cured: wrinkled, black, salt-cured.
</P>
<P>
   7. Spanish Arbequina: delicate, tiny, round, brine-cured.
</P>
<P>
   8. Tunisian: olive combined with spices and peppers.

</P>
<P>
   Pour off olive brine and set aside. Put olives in a jar they
fill almost completely, interspersing the garlic, salt, chile
pepper, oregano and bay leaves among them. Add vinegar. Mix enough
of the reserved brine with an equal amount of water to fill the jar
almost completely and pour mixture into jar. Float enough olive oil
on top to cover the surface of the liquid completely. Cover tightly
and refrigerate about 1 week before eating.
</P>
<P>
   Let olives warm to room temperature before serving, so that the
olive oil coats the olives as you remove them from the jar. Use
within a month for best flavor.

   (UNDATED) _ Sometimes investors seem even more fickle in their
fashions than teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the Microsoft verdict this week, the dot.coms and
other high-technology shares had been falling in price, in the
U.S., U.K. and around the globe. Their extraordinary gains last
winter have been going into reverse for more than a month.
</P>
<P>
   So, if there was a bubble in these shares, it has certainly
burst. But the harder question to answer is what real effects this
might have on the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Is the New Economy past its sell-by date already, dealt a fatal
blow by the verdict of the U.S. courts on its leading company?
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the charges Microsoft would level against the
U.S. government. But it is wrong. The U.S. Justice Department is
giving the New Economy a new lease of life.
</P>
<P>
   An important reason for the vigor of the American economy in the
past century has been its tough anti-monopoly policies. Tackling
Microsoft's monopoly will stimulate more innovation, more choice
and even lower prices in the high-technology industries.
</P>
<P>
   The great thing about last year's stock market boom was that it
channelled vast amounts of cheap finance to start-up companies. It
made possible a surge of investment in new infrastructure and
markets.
</P>
<P>
   There is a clear parallel with the railway mania of the mid-19th
century, when investors funded thousands of miles of track that
remain to this day the core of the rail network.
</P>
<P>
   It may become a bit harder now for new companies to raise
finance, if share prices continue to languish and the enthusiasm
for untried businesses dims. Yet investors will continue to look
for high-tech opportunities because that is where the prospects for
future economic growth will lie.
</P>
<P>
   They will become a lot more discriminating about where they put
their money. It will no longer be enough to add a dot.com to the
name of the business to rake in the millions.
</P>
<P>
   In the short-term, drastic falls in share prices could trigger a
slowdown in the economy's growth rate. However, as the Bank of
England and its U.S. counterpart, the Federal Reserve, have been
trying to engineer slower growth, that might be no bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   And looking further into the future, there is no doubt that new
technologies have set in motion a transformation of the economy and
society that has barely begun to take shape _ just as the first
rail companies in the 1840s signalled the beginning of urbanization
and mass production.
</P>
<P>
   The dot.com share bubble has been the first hint of an economic
revolution, not its last hurrah. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ As ever, there was some hoopla on Wall Street
Wednesday as two new companies came to the New York Stock Exchange
offering shares in themselves in the hope of raising lots of money.
A blue and white blimp bobbed beneath the clouds overhead and
everyone seemed to be breakfasting on doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what, though? There was not a dot.com company in sight.
</P>
<P>
   These were two decidedly old-economy companies celebrating their
new listings _ Metropolitan Life Insurance, owners of the airship,
and Krispy Kreme, a doughnut firm that has a cult following because
of its retro branding.
</P>
<P>
   The icing is decidedly off the e-commerce and Internet sectors.
Cyber-companies, also known as Netcos, that had been planning
initial public offerings have been advised by the banks to
postpone. With the tech-heavy Nasdaq in bungee mode this week, that
would seem like wise counsel.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new fear in the air for Internet-related concerns,
where, until just a few weeks ago, there was only optimism.
</P>
<P>
   It is scary for investors. But what about those legions of
cyber-executives, who may have left good, established employers, to
join the cyberspace gold rush? For them it is terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Darby Williams, for example, who, at 46, left Microsoft to
launch Cook Express, an outfit that allowed consumers to order
gastronomic dishes online for delivery to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, his became the first e-commerce company to
file for bankruptcy in Silicon Valley. When he needed money to
cover debts accumulated during his start-up, suddenly the venture
capitalists told him no.
</P>
<P>
   Or Bill Malloy, who recently resigned as chief executive of
Peapod.com, a site for those who would prefer to shop for food
online rather than visit the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   When Peapod began to come face to face with reality _ started to
run out of cash _ he resigned because of ``physical and mental
exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was news last week about the plight of several high-profile
Net pioneers, including Peabod.com, that first began to tilt the
Nasdaq into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings were issued about the ability of Peapod and Drkoop.com,
a health-care site, to stay in business. They followed an
announcement last Thursday from CDNow Inc. that it too faced a
rapid loss of cash and possible closure.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeout that seemed to be looming last week now seems
almost inevitable. The desperate plunge in the Nasdaq on Tuesday,
which was later largely recovered, will probably have profound
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ and, arguably, not before time _ investors will be looking
for real signs of profit in the Internet enterprises before they
offer the new money.
</P>
<P>
   Many players will find themselves denied funds. The only
alternative to death will be mergers and partnerships with stronger
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need money because you are trying to pay for a branding
strategy, the it will be hard,'' commented David Golden of Chase
H&AMP;Q. ``Unless companies are on the cusp of profitability, it will
be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the giants of the sector happened to be in New York for
a media conference on Tuesday, as the Nasdaq executed its
acrobatics. Like Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com and George Bell
of Excite &LR; Home. They said they liked what they were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end the focus will be on sustainable business models,
which will be good for the whole industry,'' Bell insisted.
``Investors are coming to grips with how much time they want to
give these customers to demonstrate themselves,'' Bezos added.
``And I think that is great for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite for everyone, of course. Morale in cyberland is
suddenly crashing. Not only are many companies facing some harsh
realities, but their employees are being hurt because many are
remunerated through stocks and options.
</P>
<P>
   When the value of those packages collapse, as so many will have
done this week, the motivation to work will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Some CEO's are urging employees to keep their eyes on their
jobs, not on the value of the shares and options.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Slatt of Watchguard Technologies, an Internet security
company, sent this e-mail to his staff during Tuesday: ``With these
fluctuations, you'll literally drive looking every day'' at your
personal worth. (And, of course, they may also be driven out of the
door to alternative employment.) &QL;

&HT;     STAND AGAINST LOGGING EARNS MEXICAN AN ECOLOGY PRIZE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JANE KAY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The Goldman Environmental Foundation on
Wednesday awarded a $125,000 prize to a jailed Mexican man whose
rural organization has protested logging in the Sierra Madre.
</P>
<P>
   Rodolfo Montiel Flores, 44, has been imprisoned in Iguala, in
the southern state of Guerrero, since May on drug charges. Montiel
has said he was framed by soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel helped form a union of subsistence farmers and
environmentalists. Over the past several years, they halted trucks
taking old-growth logs to a sawmill once operated by the Boise
Cascade Corp., which exported the lumber.
</P>
<P>
   Montiel and his colleagues charged that the logging practices
deforested and burned the land, virtually drying up major rivers
and killing fish.
</P>
<P>
   Alvaro Umana, the former Costa Rican environment minister and a
juror on the prize committee, announced the award Wednesday in
Mexico City. Montiel has said he would use part of the money to put
in an irrigation system on the land he and others farm.
</P>
<P>
   The Goldman Environmental Foundation will present five other
prizes April 17 at its customary awards event in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual early tribute is timed to aid Montiel in his trial
scheduled for this week. The Mexican federal prosecutor has charged
him with trafficking in drugs and possessing illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club and Amnesty International have named Montiel as
one of 10 environmentalists worldwide who are threatened by
government repression.
</P>
<P>
   Despite reports of torture, death threats and nearly a year of
imprisonment, Montiel continues to speak for the rural
environmental organization he helped form, said Victor Menotti, a
spokesman for the International Forum on Globalization, a San
Francisco nonprofit organization.
</P>
<P>
   Violence in Guerrero increased in June 1995, when state police
officers killed 17 people who were on their way to protest new
logging, Menotti said.
</P>
<P>
   The next month, Idaho-based Boise Cascade leased the sawmill in
Guerrero, and also gained exclusive rights to buy wood from some of
the communally operated lands, called ejidos.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the local people tried to persuade government officials
to stop the logging, saying that it stripped forests of old-growth
pine and fir. Then they disrupted the supply of logs to the
sawmill.
</P>
<P>
   Boise Cascade left Guerrero in 1998, citing difficulties in
fulfilling the timber quota. The corporation blamed lack of roads,
weather and other infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Bartels, a Boise Cascade spokesman, said Tuesday that his
company had contracts to buy logs from two dozen ejidos.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one environmental group on the lowlands that
apparently had concerns over the logging. We're not aware there was
widespread concern,'' Bartels said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican forestry service regulated the logging practices,
Bartels said, and he did not see any abuses when he was there.
</P>
<P>
   Although Boise Cascade was not logging or persecuting the
people, the multinational corporation had to take responsibility as
an instigator of the events, said Stephen Mills, director of the
Sierra Club's international campaign in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``What corporations like Boise Cascade have been involved in,''
said Mills, ``is colluding with governments in opposition to local
communities.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As ever, there was some hoopla on Wall Street
Wednesday as two new companies came to the New York Stock Exchange
offering shares in themselves in the hope of raising lots of money.
A blue and white blimp bobbed beneath the clouds overhead and
everyone seemed to be breakfasting on doughnuts.
</P>
<P>
   Guess what, though? There was not a dot.com company in sight.
</P>
<P>
   These were two decidedly old-economy companies celebrating their
new listings _ Metropolitan Life Insurance, owners of the airship,
and Krispy Kreme, a doughnut firm that has a cult following because
of its retro branding.
</P>
<P>
   The icing is decidedly off the e-commerce and Internet sectors.
Cyber-companies, also known as Netcos, that had been planning
initial public offerings have been advised by the banks to
postpone. With the tech-heavy Nasdaq in bungee mode this week, that
would seem like wise counsel.
</P>
<P>
   There is a new fear in the air for Internet-related concerns,
where, until just a few weeks ago, there was only optimism.
</P>
<P>
   It is scary for investors. But what about those legions of
cyber-executives, who may have left good, established employers, to
join the cyberspace gold rush? For them it is terrifying.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Darby Williams, for example, who, at 46, left Microsoft to
launch Cook Express, an outfit that allowed consumers to order
gastronomic dishes online for delivery to their homes.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, his became the first e-commerce company to
file for bankruptcy in Silicon Valley. When he needed money to
cover debts accumulated during his start-up, suddenly the venture
capitalists told him no.
</P>
<P>
   Or Bill Malloy, who recently resigned as chief executive of
Peapod.com, a site for those who would prefer to shop for food
online rather than visit the supermarket.
</P>
<P>
   When Peapod began to come face to face with reality _ started to
run out of cash _ he resigned because of ``physical and mental
exhaustion.''
</P>
<P>
   It was news last week about the plight of several high-profile
Net pioneers, including Peabod.com, that first began to tilt the
Nasdaq into the ditch.
</P>
<P>
   Warnings were issued about the ability of Peapod and Drkoop.com,
a health-care site, to stay in business. They followed an
announcement last Thursday from CDNow Inc. that it too faced a
rapid loss of cash and possible closure.
</P>
<P>
   The shakeout that seemed to be looming last week now seems
almost inevitable. The desperate plunge in the Nasdaq on Tuesday,
which was later largely recovered, will probably have profound
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Now _ and, arguably, not before time _ investors will be looking
for real signs of profit in the Internet enterprises before they
offer the new money.
</P>
<P>
   Many players will find themselves denied funds. The only
alternative to death will be mergers and partnerships with stronger
players.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you need money because you are trying to pay for a branding
strategy, the it will be hard,'' commented David Golden of Chase
H&AMP;Q. ``Unless companies are on the cusp of profitability, it will
be difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the giants of the sector happened to be in New York for
a media conference on Tuesday, as the Nasdaq executed its
acrobatics. Like Jeff Bezos, founder of Amazon.com and George Bell
of Excite &LR; Home. They said they liked what they were seeing.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end the focus will be on sustainable business models,
which will be good for the whole industry,'' Bell insisted.
``Investors are coming to grips with how much time they want to
give these customers to demonstrate themselves,'' Bezos added.
``And I think that is great for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Not quite for everyone, of course. Morale in cyberland is
suddenly crashing. Not only are many companies facing some harsh
realities, but their employees are being hurt because many are
remunerated through stocks and options.
</P>
<P>
   When the value of those packages collapse, as so many will have
done this week, the motivation to work will vanish.
</P>
<P>
   Some CEO's are urging employees to keep their eyes on their
jobs, not on the value of the shares and options.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Slatt of Watchguard Technologies, an Internet security
company, sent this e-mail to his staff during Tuesday: ``With these
fluctuations, you'll literally drive looking every day'' at your
personal worth. (And, of course, they may also be driven out of the
door to alternative employment.) &QL;

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bill Gates remained defiant Tuesday in the face of a
dramatic court ruling on Monday that his software behemoth,
Microsoft, blatantly violated free competition laws to squash its
Silicon Valley rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling triggered a dramatic meltdown in technology stocks as
investors ran scared, triggering a massive sell-off across Wall
Street Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the stock of his company _ and therefore the paper value
of his own fortune _ continued to plunge, Gates brushed aside
suggestions that his company may be broken up by the courts as
punishment for its transgressions. He also reiterated his promise
to fight the findings in the appeal courts.
</P>
<P>
   The next stage in the battle will be hearings by the same judge
who issued Monday's verdict, Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, to
determine just what the punishment should be.
</P>
<P>
   They could last four months with the judge therefore reaching
his conclusion in the late summer. That, however, is when the
appeals process is likely to begin.
</P>
<P>
   It will pass through the Washington, D.C. appellate system first
before it goes thereafter, almost inevitably, to the U.S. Supreme
Court. Most experts consider that the entire process will not be
exhausted until the summer of 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Because the road ahead is so long, any real pain for Microsoft
is likely to be delayed or blunted. And while the wheels of U.S.
justice continue to turn at their near-glacial pace, innovation in
the marketplace continues to accelerate. In two years time, any
final outcome for Microsoft may be moot.
</P>
<P>
   Options for Judge Penfield Jackson in the penalty phase range
from breaking up Microsoft into several new companies, perhaps as
many as five, to something far less draconian like demanding that
the existing Microsoft simply adopt more competition-friendly
business practices.
</P>
<P>
   There were calls on the court Tuesday to take the harshest steps
possible against Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``The judge has laid the foundation for the breakup of
Microsoft,'' consumer advocate Ralph Nader commented. ``Anything
less than that will be like a thundering elephant emitting the
squeak of a mouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gates, in an interview with the BBC, seemed sure that would
not happen. ``I don't think any extreme remedy such as a breakup is
at all consistent with what the court put forward,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Insisting that Microsoft would prevail on appeal, he added:
``Common sense stands on our side.''
</P>
<P>
   So does time. While the U.S. government may seek to have parts
of whatever remedy Judge Penfield Jackson comes out with applied
immediately, it is likely that any serious sort of sanctions,
certainly including a call for a breakup, would be frozen by the
courts pending Microsoft's appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile history shows that Microsoft does better with appeals
judges than in the lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the politics of the fight. It remains unclear
whether even the Clinton administration would really have the
stomach to splinter Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, Gates may be hoping for a change of party colors at
the White House. He will be hoping for a victory in November for
George Bush, Jr., who is thought to have a slightly more relaxed
view on enforcement of U.S. monopoly laws.
</P>
<P>
   That there are several factors still on Gates' side was
reflected by investor alerts issues by several leading Wall Street
banks Tuesday, all urging clients to buy Microsoft shares rather
than to dump them.
</P>
<P>
   As well as pointing to the likely length of an appeals effort,
analysts noted that a settlement between the company and the
government remains a possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the case moves forward from here, the government may find
it increasingly difficult to count on the outcome,'' Credit Suisse
First Boston said in its alert. ``This could in turn increase the
potential for a settlement.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that investors themselves were listening Tuesday as a
continuing sell-off on the Nasdaq exchange in New York pushed it
into what is formally termed a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft itself continued to suffer a brutal battering, sinking
by midday an additional 2 5/8 to 88. That in turn meant further
devastation of the fortune of Gates himself, who saw its value, in
paper terms, eroded by $12.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the historic ruling, meanwhile, are most of
Microsoft's Silicon Valley rivals, some of whom were instrumental
in triggering the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been vindicated,'' remarked James Barksdale, the founder
of Netscape. ``The ruling is great for consumers and for people who
use technology.'' &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Not that investors themselves were listening Tuesday as a
continuing sell-off on the Nasdaq exchange in New York pushed it
into what is formally termed a bear market.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft itself continued to suffer a brutal battering, sinking
by midday an additional 2 5/8 to 88. That in turn meant further
devastation of the fortune of Gates himself, who saw its value, in
paper terms, eroded by $12.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrating the historic ruling, meanwhile, are most of
Microsoft's Silicon Valley rivals, some of whom were instrumental
in triggering the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been vindicated,'' remarked James Barksdale, the founder
of Netscape. ``The ruling is great for consumers and for people who
use technology.'' &QL;

<P>
   We are probably going to have to get used to Bill Gates's nasal
whine insisting that his company, Microsoft, has done ``nothing
wrong,'' and that Judge Penfield Jackson's verdict on Monday _ that
Microsoft has a monopoly position in computer software and has
abused it _ will stifle his company's ``freedom to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   But the court evidence clearly showed that it is Gates who is
wrong, and the judge who was right.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is a company that has abused its position in the
software market to try to create a monopoly of Internet operating
systems, and seems determined to extend its hold to handheld
computers and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
   The question now is what remedies the judge should prescribe.
</P>
<P>
   ``Break the company up,'' some suggest. In theory it sounds
attractive, but in practice it would be like trying to remove
unwanted software from your Windows PC _ a drawn-out process that
never quite seems finished.
</P>
<P>
   How could one define what pieces of software the different
companies should own? Microsoft has worked very hard to blur the
lines.
</P>
<P>
   When Standard Oil was broken up early in the last century, the
process was messy and simply created more powerful siblings. It
would be even more complex with a hi-tech company such as
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than teasing the company strands apart, Judge Jackson has
a simpler remedy available, which would, at a stroke, erase
Microsoft's monopoly while still leaving it ``free to innovate.''
</P>
<P>
   He should make the ``source code'' (the ``GPL'' license) of the
many variants of the Windows operating system now on sale publicly
available, for free, and stipulate that changes must also be made
public.
</P>
<P>
   Not only would that curtail Microsoft's ability to dominate the
market, but it would be a constraint in keeping with the innovative
nature of the business.
</P>
<P>
   The source code is the spell that works the magic on the
machine. See it, and you can see how the beast does its work.
</P>
<P>
   For years, software developers have struggled with the fact that
Windows is like a multi-story building with a few dusty windows,
through which they could glimpse the activity in some rooms, and
write their products according to what they saw in those rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft's software developers (for Word, or Access) had
complete access to all of the building, giving them the ability to
write products that used far more facilities. And when the contents
of the rooms changed _ which they did with amazing regularity _
Microsoft always had the head start.
</P>
<P>
   Making the source code freely available would mean there was
still an industry standard that could be referred to.
</P>
<P>
   With the source code published, Microsoft would lose its revenue
stream from operating systems. It would be forced to live on its
wits _ forced to innovate, which is something it has done precious
little of in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
   We will have to wait for the judge's remedies, which we feel
should also include large financial penalties to indicate the
damage that has been done to companies such as Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, we can reflect on this: the U.S. Department of
Justice has shown that the courts can stop a multinational, given
able lawyers and the right laws. &QL;

HAMANA DIRECTOR HEADING TO SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE _ Look out Seattle, a Louisville Slugger is on the
way. This particular heavy hitter is no candidate for the Baseball
Hall of Fame, but someone should consider making space for him in
the theatrical version.
</P>
<P>
   With the closing of the 24th Humana Festival of New American
Plays this coming weekend, director Jon Jory and his family will
begin making the transition from their home in this languid Ohio
River town to the lively environs of Seattle's U District.
</P>
<P>
   After 31 years as artistic head of Actors Theatre of Louisville
_ where he produced nearly 1,400 productions that included more
than 290 new plays _ Jory will join the University of Washington
School of Drama in the fall as a tenured professor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, Jory and his talented spouse, costume
designer Marcia Dixcy Jory, have their hands full with an annual
new play festival that attracts critics, agents, producers and
theater people from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 festival includes works by 31 playwrights, a
satisfyingly symmetrical number considering the length of Jory's
tenure in Louisville. As in past years, though, only a half-dozen
of the 33 pieces on display can be considered fully realized
dramatic works. A 75-minute dramatic anthology of 19 scenes, for
instance, is little more than a contrivance to make sure that
festival visitors see performances by the company's young
apprentices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's innovation, so-called ``phone plays,'' already
appears somewhat shopworn. The now-traditional 10-minute plays
feature Tina Howe, Naomi Wallace and David Ives writing crisp, if
familiar vignettes. But all of the brief interludes are mere
appetizers for the main course of six full-length plays.
</P>
<P>
   Many playwrights have become identified with the Humana
festival, but none more so than Kentucky playwright Jane Martin.
The pseudonymous Martin frequently tackles subjects that are edgy
and ``politically incorrect'' _ often topics of particular interest
to women. But the author tends to balance her conflicts and avoid
simplistic resolutions to issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one who has ever seen her will describe her, many
believe Jory himself is Martin. He is her director at Humana and
his own plays stopped appearing about the time that she arrived on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever Martin is, though, she is certainly a sophisticated
observer of the theater. Her current comedy, ``Anton in Show
Business,'' lacerates everyone in sight as she satirizes actors,
directors, producers, funders and critics. Seven women play 16
roles _ including several male ones _ as the author pokes fun at
Hollywood ambition, cross-dressing, multiculturalism and the grand
tradition of rehearsal romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anton'' looks at the troubles encountered when artists with
big aspirations (and very little money) attempt a production of
Chekhov's ``The Three Sisters'' in San Antonio _ a city notorious
for its battles over arts funding in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One critic seated nearby turned and said, ``it's the great
kiss-off.'' But Martin's own critic in the play _ who is planted in
the audience and stops the action from time to time to question or
complain _ turns the author's pen on herself when she complains
that the play satirizes ``something dead in culture'' (theater),
which is like ``beating a dead horse ... from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-consciously echoing the Chekhov play in its approach to the
importance of work, Martin's play is ultimately upbeat and
life-affirming. Crisply staged by Jory, ``Anton'' is both raucously
funny and painful to watch. And we never quite shake the sense that
this is a farewell to the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The other strong showing at the festival is Charles F. Mee's
``Big Love,'' a sprawling tale _ literally and figuratively _ that
pits 50 brides against 50 brothers. Based on Aeschylus' ``The
Suppliant Women,'' the play unearths every unpleasant stereotype
about the relationships between men and women. The antagonists rant
and rail at one another until words no longer suffice. Then,
passions bubble up from deep within their bodies and the actors
explode in a maelstrom of physical expression. The result is
powerfully affecting in its humor and its madness.
</P>
<P>
   In ``War of the Worlds,'' director Anne Bogart examines the life
and work of Orson Welles by mirroring the director's storytelling
style in the film ``Citizen Kane.'' But beneath the surface of the
Welles story, Bogart and her collaborator, Naomi Iizuka, also probe
the nature of truth, reality and identity. Notions of ``reality''
are commented on by shifting our gaze away from what we know or
believe to be true. Bogart and Iizuka demonstrate how reality can
be constructed by manipulating its presentation. The lingering
image of this poignant piece is that of an artist unhinged by his
personal demons.
</P>
<P>
   We expect artists to raise questions about life and our role in
the world around us. In this year's festival offerings, there seems
to be more pondering than usual. Why, these playwrights seem to
ask, must we live with so much pain?
</P>
<P>
   For the departing Jory, an exciting new life awaits in Seattle.
There is a new home, new students, new colleagues. Will the
artistic directorates of Seattle theaters open their doors to the
accomplished director? They are foolish if they do not.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, we needn't weep for Jory. Now that he is no
longer burdened with running the most important new play festival
in the United States, his work is bound to appear in theaters
around the country, off-Broadway and on.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one other question. Will Jane Martin fit into his
suitcase?

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A Bay Area urologist treating a patient who
works at an Internet start-up recently had an idea. For their next
appointment, the urologist joked, he wanted to be paid in shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``Think of what the guy does all day, for a doctor's salary,''
the Internet executive said sympathetically. ``Of course he wants
to get into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Like the bankers, lawyers and venture capitalists he reads about
in the papers daily, the urologist wanted in on the action, and
these days it seems that everyone but the doctor is welcome.
</P>
<P>
   Today, hordes of business-to-business contractors who make deals
with high-technology companies are trading their services for
equity. While law firms have long taken slices of their clients'
companies on top of regular fees, consultants are now doing the
same, along with public-relations agencies, executive search firms
and commercial landlords. Even independent engineers and building
contractors are participating in the equity swap meet.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're five for five,'' said Ed Niehaus, a co-founder of
Niehaus Ryan Wong, a San Francisco public-relations firm that
serves technology-company clients. ``We've taken cash plus shares
as payment from five companies and have seen all five go public.''
</P>
<P>
   A sixth company, spun off from one of the five, went bankrupt,
but Yahoo and OnSale.com were among the group, according to an
executive close to the deals.
</P>
<P>
   For public-relations agencies that work with high-technology
ventures, the opportunities for such deals are rife. Because of a
shortage of agencies that are expert in technology, firms such as
Niehaus Ryan Wong are picking and choosing whom they will work with
and how they will be paid. And venture capitalists, or VCs, warn
start-ups that their business plans must incorporate publicity
efforts, which sends 30 to 50 companies knocking on Niehaus' door
every week, many offering stock.
</P>
<P>
   All of which makes signing contracts with new clients resemble
aggressive stock picking.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're acting like a venture capitalist when you do this,''
Niehaus said.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Bates has placed about 20 such bets since she founded
Sunny Bates Associates, an executive search firm, in New York 11
years ago. The firm serves high-techology companies and the news
media. She said, ``We've hit twice, once with Priceline and now
with a company still in its quiet period.
</P>
<P>
   ``These sorts of deals not only help us develop the value of our
company and get our recruiters involved,'' Bates continued, ``but
they also guarantee a different kind of relationship _ not a
hit-and-run, but a mind-share involvement. If you're a stakeholder,
you give freely of your introductions and your time, your contacts.
You're not hoarding.''
</P>
<P>
   For recruiters, equity reimbursements often follow the same
formula as cash fees. Search agencies have traditionally taken a
third of the newly placed executive's first year's salary, but now
that fee is combined with a third of the executive's first year's
stock options.
</P>
<P>
   Stock deals can be complicated, however, and vary widely. Some
require no vesting or ``lock-up'' period, so recipients can cash in
the minute a company hits the public market. Some deals involve
options and some warrants. Both represent the right to buy stock at
a given price in the future. Warrants, however, tend to be subject
to fewer tax and accounting rules and can be issued on a more ad
hoc basis than options.
</P>
<P>
   In real estate, where the equity-as-currency phenomenon is
stirring up this fairly traditional industry, landlords are
agreeing to take warrants in lieu of security deposits. A wildly
competitive real estate market can give the landlords more
discretion over tenants and how they can structure deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rents are going up on a biweekly basis in my area,'' said Ted
Caulkins, an associate director of leasing services in San
Francisco for Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, the international real estate
brokerage firm. ``A landlord usually has three to six offers, and
it becomes a beauty contest. That's where the stock element gets
very attractive.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in New York, where large, institutional landlords reign
supreme, stock-for-space swaps are occurring in smaller niches.
Rudin Management, which owns highly visible commercial properties
in the financial district of Manhattan, has done four such deals.
</P>
<P>
   When Rudin Management negotiated with xBind, a
networking-technology company, ``we liked their business model,''
said William Rudin, the president.
</P>
<P>
   With Homedelivery.com, which accepts orders for local merchants
through its Web site, Rudin Management saw other possible
collaborations. ``We own a lot of residential apartments in
Manhattan, and Homedelivery.com's services can add value for our
customers.''
</P>
<P>
   When New York landlords and dot-coms start talking synergy,
times have changed. Or have they?
</P>
<P>
   ``My grandfather's philosophy was to buy stock in a company that
moved into his building,'' Rudin said. ``It's a slight variation of
the theme.''
</P>
<P>
   But buying stock in companies beyond your balance sheet is not
the same as taking stock for pay. At Cushman &AMP; Wakefield, Thomas
Falus, the president of the New York operations, does not favor the
equity high-wire act.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're investing vast amounts of money in earnings to grow our
business in China and South America,'' Falus said. ``We can't
afford not to be profitable in mature markets like New York.''
</P>
<P>
   For him, playing the equity game with square footage is no
better than playing the horses without knowing a thing about
thoroughbreds.
</P>
<P>
   Caulkins agreed that companies needed to do their homework.
``These deals put the landlord in the position of a V.C.,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Jamar sang the same refrain: ``I use the same criteria in
negotiating with clients that a V.C. would use.''
</P>
<P>
   A marketing consultant with 20 years' experience in high-tech
businesses, Jamar has taken noncash payment to the next level by
incorporating it into his business model.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's become a core component of my strategy, to build a
portfolio of equity in companies. Right now I have stock, or
agreements to take stock, in four companies. I imagine over the
next 12 to 18 months, I'll probably hold equity in 10 to 15
companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Because he works with early-stage start-up companies, Jamar asks
for a minimum of their scarce cash and most of his compensation in
options.
</P>
<P>
   At this end of the spectrum _ where e-commerce companies are
even cutting in one-man-show consultants who would otherwise be
billing at $150 an hour _ the territory is relatively untested.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a brave new world for most independent contractors and
their clients,'' said Michael Dortch, who has been following the
high-technology industry as an independent research analyst for
most of the last 25 years. ``Think about it just on a logistical
basis: Companies tend to work with a lot of contractors; for each
equity arrangement, you've got to go before your board and write up
a specific contract; no one has the time to manage that much
overhead.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that momentum is building. ``Somewhere down the road,''
Dortch predicted, ``forward thinking start-ups might build into
their business plans classes of equity specifically for independent
contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   So, does all this swapping portend a world in which every office
temp and smoothie delivery person builds a portfolio of investments
in the start-ups they serve?
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly. While the equity flows between businesses and their
contractors in ever larger quantities, plenty of young companies
are clutching to their ownership, declaring their equity too
valuable to hand off to outsiders.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hudes, the president of Organic Online, a Web company
that builds sites and provides marketing services and that went
public in February, held firm when potential landlords proposed
that Hudes pay in equity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we gave equity to any number of partners who approached us,
we'd have missed out on giving ownership to the people who matter
most, our employees.''
</P>
<P>
   And after an initial offering, most companies become stingy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get capitalized,'' said Isabel Maxwell, the president
of CommTouch Software, a provider of e-mail services, ``you're
looking at mergers and acquisitions. You buy what you need. I doubt
you'll find well-capped companies who would give away stock to
small contractors.''
</P>
<P>
   But as long as word keeps spreading that dot-com options are
today's top dollar, contractors will clamor for them. Take the
building contractor who badgered a San Francisco executive for
warrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a total knucklehead request,'' the executive said.
``Ten thousand shares, he kept on insisting, 10,000 shares. But he
had no idea of the exercise price or how many shares we had
outstanding!''

<P>
   Every day of the week, wiry, 27-year-old Zhang Minyou hoists 40
to 80 water jugs out of his smart, 19th-century-styled pedicart,
trudges through a labyrinth of laundry-lined alleys and groans his
way up dozens of creaky stairs.
</P>
<P>
   After delivering the goods to one customer, Minyou, an Aquarius
water deliveryman, hops back on his tricycle to peddle to his next
customer through Shanghai's byzantine streets.
</P>
<P>
   He is a cheap but crucial link in an idiosyncratic door-to-door
mainland distribution system that fills orders placed with the
click of a 21st-century mouse.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, this ``fulfillment'' can be left to
domestic mail carriers, such as the United States Postal Service
and United Parcel Service, that offer easy, efficient delivery,
making the transition from a virtual to a physical world a seamless
process for new Internet companies.
</P>
<P>
   But in China, where the dreams of dot-com wealth soar as high as
the obstacles to e-commerce _ such as snail mail that deserves the
name, a balkanized banking system and a near-absence of consumer
credit cards _ success calls for a kind of ingenuity not taught at
business school.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of credit-card transactions, cash on delivery is the
most common method of e-commerce payment. Instead of relying on
delivery companies, start-ups like MyWeb of San Francisco are
becoming partners with a rare combination of local distributors,
including fleets of taxis and university students on bicycles.
</P>
<P>
   The auction house EachNet, with listings that span nine mainland
cities, links buyers and sellers in any given city. After the
bidding is closed, they arrange to meet each other face to face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just last June, there wasn't a lot being done,'' says Ted
Dean, a partner at the Beijing-based Internet consulting company
BDA. ``Now there are entrepreneurs setting up partnerships,
delivering goods, marketing to customers and dealing with
processing returns. Even if China's still in the early stages of
e-commerce, even if most transactions are still cash on delivery,
the Net companies are actually solving the next set of marketing
and logistical problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In a reversal of conventional Internet wisdom, traditional
brick-and-mortar, state-owned enterprises that boast an established
distribution system and a valuable customer base may have an edge
over brash new Net companies struggling to overcome delivery
problems and increase online traffic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were virtual before we went online,'' Aquarius sales
manager Yan Boer says.
</P>
<P>
   The company's more than 400,000 customers could already order
through the network's 24-hour, seven-day a week telephone hotline
last year, he adds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything was already computerized,'' he says, ``and our
delivery system was already in place. All we needed to do was to
add a Web site.''
</P>
<P>
   The site went up on Jan. 1, adding a virtual layer to an
operation that, as Yan boasted, started from the ground up as a
traditional delivery company. Trucks from the Aquarius warehouses
stop daily at more than 100 delivery depots across the city, each
equipped with a computer linked to the headquarters, where 28,000
transactions are processed on the telephone and Web daily.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 pedicart drivers gather at the depots to get
their routes each morning and load their carts. They return twice
during their 12-to-15-hour workday, to get the afternoon and
evening orders and refill their carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's cost-effective and efficient,'' Yan says, adding that
Aquarius, a unit of one of Shanghai's largest food companies, plans
to expand its operations to seven more cities this year.
</P>
<P>
   Unspoken is the fact that a distribution system like this
depends on a cheap migrant work force flooding into the major
cities from poorer provinces, working for as little as 36 cents an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Minyou the pedicart driver says it's better than Anhui,
the province south of Shanghai where he came from.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food costs next to nothing here,'' he says, ``so I can save a
lot of money.''
</P>
<P>
   As he hops on his tricycle and prepares to peddle half a mile
through icy winds to his next delivery site, Li Zhongshen, a
35-year-old driver and former rice farmer, says that such work will
always fall to migrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No Shanghainese could do this anyway,'' he says. ``They
wouldn't be able to stand it.''

<P>
   Josie True, a Chinese-American cartoon girl in an online game,
hunts for her missing teacher by time-traveling. Along the way, she
strikes up conversations with little-known historical heroines like
Bessie Coleman, the first African-American to earn an international
pilot's license.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike most Web-based action games, which generally interest
boys, ``The Adventures of Josie True'' is designed to appeal to
girls' interests in characters and narratives. In sly fashion,
Josie also introduces players to role models absent from most
history books, while increasing their computer fluency.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a moneymaking scheme,'' said Mary Flanagan, an
assistant professor of media studies at the University of Buffalo,
who is developing the game with a grant of $199,920 from the
National Science Foundation. Her concern is the lack of educational
software aimed at girls, particularly minority girls.
</P>
<P>
   Tapping this overlooked market, Flanagan thought, could help
solve a stubborn gender gap. Girls still take fewer advanced
computer-science classes than boys and are more likely to shy away
from careers like engineering, said a 1998 report by the American
Association of University Women. Part of the reason, the report
said, was that boys play computer games more than girls and enter
classrooms far more comfortable with computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a software developer's dream to do something you're
committed to,'' said Flanagan, who hired graduate students to
finish the online game
(www.buffalo.edu &QC; /scripts/newnews/index.cgi?article &QC; (EQ)theadventu)
by the end of this year. For schools and girls without Web access,
Flanagan intends to produce CD-ROMs.
</P>
<P>
   With modest government assistance and a passion for closing the
digital gender gap, Flanagan is demonstrating how the Internet can
be an egalitarian tool for self-expression. The site, like other
noncommercial sites being developed around the United States, is
intended to be an example of high-minded goals that have not been
eclipsed by the cacophony of e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Without millions of dollars of investors' money to buy
mass-market advertising, noncommercial sites, especially ones
catering to untapped or underserved sectors, face an uphill battle
as they try to gather like-minded audiences from the far corners of
cyberspace. But such efforts are far from a lost cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not different from any other medium,'' said Ekaterina
Walsh, a consumer analyst for Forrester Research in Cambridge,
Mass. Compared with slickly packaged Web content for mass
audiences, original and unadorned sites are a breath of fresh air
that gain word-of-mouth (or e-mail) credibility ``in the same way
NPR and PBS stand out on radio and TV,'' Walsh said.
</P>
<P>
   And developers of noncommercial sites can salve their dot-com
envy with a patina of respect. Research shows that consumers are
more likely to trust nonprofit sites than commercial ones, Walsh
said.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to penetrate popular culture through radio and television
advertisements, some developers of noncommercial sites have
resorted to grass-roots efforts to build an audience, particularly
among those without Internet connections. This approach can be
successful when the audience itself ends up being the supplier of
low-cost content.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in public libraries in Newark, Harlem and
Melbourne, Australia, youngsters are dabbling at a test site,
www.kahootz.com.au, where they can create and publish animated
stories and inventions online, then ``chat'' about their work.
</P>
<P>
   At a recent tryout of the site in Newark, schoolchildren on two
continents showed off their child-centric creations: a homework
helper and a dirt-to-food machine.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're creating a channel for interactive design to stimulate
girls and kids who don't have computers at home, to get them to
start thinking of themselves as designers and inventors,'' said
Dorothy T. Bennett, the project director of the Education
Development Center for Children and Technology, which is developing
the site with the Children's Television Foundation in Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Another grass-roots project has already drawn participation from
nearly 1,000 children in 139 countries. Their contributions filled
an online bulletin board devoted to how young people believe
technology can improve the world. The first Web site,
www.jrsummit.net, spawned a second, www.nation1.org. The project
began with professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
Media Lab, who contacted education officials around the world to
attract young people to participate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about bringing underrepresented groups online,'' said
Justine Cassell, a Media Lab professor who was one of the program's
organizers and is a co-editor of the book ``From Barbie to Mortal
Kombat: Gender and Computer Games.''
</P>
<P>
   Another approach to reaching such an overlooked audience comes
from Oakland, Calif., the eighth-largest city in the state.
Pummeled by the 1989 earthquake and a catastrophic fire in 1994,
the city is struggling to make an economic comeback, particularly
in East and West Oakland, which are characterized by a mix of
stately but aging Victorian houses, boarded-up storefronts and few
commercial services, like supermarkets and bank branches.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the underserved communities to move to the served
category,'' the community, not corporations, will have to create
the content, said David Geilhufe, the director of the Eastmont
Computing Center in Oakland, where 350 people receive computer
training financed by the National Science Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   This version of urban renewal is aimed at compressing the
digital divide in poorer neighborhoods without typically putting
computers in every classroom. Instead, the city and its
philanthropic partners are counting on the virtual world to provide
banking services that are unavailable to many residents in the
community.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of developing an e-banking service in this market,
about $300,000, with investment payback expected to be slow, is
being shared by four lenders led by Union Bank of California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll mobilize and test and pull people into it,'' said Donald
Vial, the chairman of the California Foundation on the Environment
and Economy, a nonprofit group in San Francisco. Starting in May,
about 200 people will use the service, which will be offered at
five community technology centers, among them Eastmont.
</P>
<P>
   Participants will receive training in computers and household
financial management and learn how to navigate an e-banking site
that will be customized for language and culture, said Norman Jayo,
the foundation's senior strategist.
</P>
<P>
   E-banking has the potential to show people that technology can
make a difference in their lives, whether by helping a small
business grow or helping someone on welfare to find a job, he said.
</P>
<P>
   A goal of Oakland's e-banking site is to show lenders and other
Web businesses that demand exists in neighborhoods being bypassed
by e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the application is significant to them, it takes off,''
Jayo said. ``It's using technology as a base for empowerment.''

   When Wal-Mart Stores Inc. got serious about the Internet, it set
up an online company in the heart of Silicon Valley, complete with
couches, foosball and late-night brainstorming sessions over pizza
and Chinese takeout. The cultural divide between Wal-Mart, the
nation's largest retailer, and its dot-com offspring is as great as
the 1,500 miles between Wal-Mart's headquarters in Bentonville,
Ark., and California _ and that is on purpose.
</P>
<P>
   As establishing an Internet presence becomes imperative for
brick-and-mortar companies, they face the urgent question of how
much distance, physical and logistical, to put between themselves
and their online operations.
</P>
<P>
   Spinning off an Internet business offers the lure of cashing in
on the new economy's lofty valuations while creating a company
that, at least in theory, can respond more quickly to the turmoil
of the online marketplace because it is less bureaucratic.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to measure the success of that strategy. But
analysts say that, in the long run, the winners may be companies
that successfully integrate their online and offline businesses,
such as the Charles Schwab Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers are really looking to do business with companies
through a variety of channels,'' said Michael Bernstein, senior
analyst with the Gartner Group, the technology consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Brick-and-mortar companies have the advantage of familiar brand
names and established infrastructures. But with no rule book on how
to parlay those strengths into Internet success, companies are
trying everything from tightly integrated e-commerce divisions to
independent spinoffs with license to cannibalize the parent's
business by undercutting its prices.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street's tolerance of huge losses by Internet start-ups and
the triple-digit price-to-earnings multiples they command are a
seductive incentive to separate the balance sheets. Barnes &AMP; Noble
Inc. netted $486 million when it took its online business public
last May. Staples Inc. expects to raise as much as $250 million in
an initial offering of Staples.com stock this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're under a lot of pressure to create value for
shareholders, it's really hard to say no,'' said Prof. Brandt
Allen, associate dean of the Darden Graduate School of Business at
the University of Virginia in Charlottesville.
</P>
<P>
   Established companies hope that spinoffs, and their stock
options, will help them compete for the scarce talent they need.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chance to be part of something that's changing the world,
as well as potentially making people very well off at a very young
age, that's hard to resist,'' said Richard Kurovsky, marketing
director at the Haas School of Management at the University of
California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   At the Haas School, interview slots with old-line companies such
as General Electric, Clorox and Nestle have gone unfilled, Kurovsky
said, adding that the Internet is ``a siren call.''
</P>
<P>
   Locating Wal-Mart.com in Palo Alto, Calif., was a strategic
decision, said James W. Breyer, the managing partner of Accel
Partners, the venture capital firm in Palo Alto that joined with
Wal-Mart to create Wal-Mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're able to attract a level of personnel that's simply
impossible to attract elsewhere in the country,'' Breyer said.
</P>
<P>
   He insisted that Wal-Mart and Wal-Mart.com would work
``seamlessly'' together, even after the dot-com business goes
public. But not everyone believes the model can work.
</P>
<P>
   At Charles Schwab, the Internet business was run separately at
first, which was crucial to its development, said Vincent Phillips,
senior vice president for Web systems at the brokerage firm. But
Schwab's customers eventually spurred a decision to integrate the
online and offline operations, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Customers don't see us as two different channels; they see us
as one entity. And that's really the answer you need, not what
makes sense from a business-planning model.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwab cannot offer employees start-up-style stock options, but
it offers the resources to ensure that projects get done, as well
as a huge customer base and the chance to live a more balanced
life, Phillips said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At Schwab, you're not going to have to work 22 hours a day to
participate in a dot-com experience,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like most companies entering the untested waters of the
Internet, Schwab had to face the possibility that the online
business would undercut its original business. After a barrage of
objections to a double-pricing standard for regular and online-only
customers, Schwab shifted to a flat rate in 1998, knowing it would
lose more than $100 million in commissions. The gamble paid off:
Trading volume surged, and by the end of the year, revenues and
profits were up.
</P>
<P>
   The reluctant consensus among chief executives was that if you
do not cannibalize your own business, someone else will.
</P>
<P>
   Cooling the spinoff fever is the dismal experience of
Barnesandnoble.com, whose stock price has dropped by more than half
since the business went public last May.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts attribute the performance to poor integration of the
online and offline businesses. Customers in stores cannot use
computers to look for books online, where the selection is greater
_ although the company says that will change this year _ and
customers cannot return books bought online to stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The barriers between the store and the site are
unbelievable,'' said Evan Schwartz, author of ``Digital
Darwinism,'' a guide to business survival on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   From the point of view of employees, Schwartz said, spinoffs,
with their separate compensation plans and potentially lucrative
stock options, can demoralize employees at the parent company and
create friction in what should be a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who wouldn't want to jump to the other side?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to prevent such internal strife, Staples is giving
dot-com stock options to some employees in the brick-and-mortar
business. Other companies are issuing dot-com options to their
offline sales forces or giving double commissions on Internet
advertising sales.
</P>
<P>
   The greatest danger of spinning off an Internet business may be
that it represents the company's future, said Allen of the
University of Virginia. When a company enters a partnership to set
up a dot-com, as Barnes &AMP; Noble did with the European publishing
company Bertelsmann, it is easy to wind up holding less than 50
percent of the spinoff's stock, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a temptation for people to say `Don't worry about the
future, I'll just go ahead and take whatever I can get right
now.'''
</P>
<P>
   Some companies try to avoid this danger by employing a halfway
step known as a tracking stock. Instead of spinning off an
operation, the company issues shares that are tied specifically to
the division's performance. Although the tracking shares trade like
normal stock, investors who buy them do not actually buy a piece of
the subsidiary, as they do when purchasing normal common shares.
</P>
<P>
   The tracking shares usually focus on a popular piece of the
company, so they normally receive a higher market valuation than
the parent's stock. This allows the company to unlock some of the
value in its assets without selling them.
</P>
<P>
   Media companies, in particular, have found that this tool
permits them to maintain control of the part of the business _
their online content _ that may well determine their futures.
Several companies have each isolated their Internet assets in a
single division, laying the groundwork for later public offerings.
The New York Times Co. announced earlier this year that it would
issue a tracking stock for Times Company Digital, the company's
Internet division.
</P>
<P>
   Whether an Internet business is spun off or not, analysts agree
that it must have independent management and accountability.
</P>
<P>
   ``These e-businesses have to be free to operate and do things in
nontraditional ways,'' said Bruce Buckland, president of Inforonics
Inc. of Littleton, Mass., which provides Internet support services.
``If they're not, they can't possibly keep up with the rapid pace
of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two guys in a garage who are risking nothing are going to come
and eat your lunch,'' he added.

BETTER WAYS TO SEARCH THAN TYPING `NEEDLE AND HAYSTACK'

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   The modern equivalent of searching for a needle in a haystack is
searching for just about anything on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   To illustrate this, three very different people were asked to
track down three very different items in a random, completely
unscientific test _ a sort of digital treasure hunt.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, this trio of e-commerce guinea pigs followed
similar paths. Each conducted highly focused searches, and at some
stage each used the search engine Yahoo, which could explain why
that company is valued at more than $70 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Nicole Vanderbilt, vice president and senior analyst with
Jupiter Communications, an online research firm, was then enlisted
to comment on the searchers' strategies and offer advice for doing
it better next time. Knowing where to look in the first place, how
to phrase a search term and how to weed through sites returned by
the search engine, she said, are techniques that consumers learn
over time.
</P>
<P>
   ASSIGNMENT: HAWAIIAN SHIRT. Searcher: Alesia Powell of New York.
Clicks: three.
</P>
<P>
   My friend Alesia Powell, 38, has never surfed waves in her life,
and she goes out of her way not to go to stores. So she seemed the
perfect person to assign the task of finding a Hawaiian shirt. It's
not something that she has ever done, or ever would do.
</P>
<P>
   Alesia, who works at CBS Healthwatch, a Web company, started at
Yahoo, typing in ``Hawaiian shirt.''
</P>
<P>
   Why there? ``Yahoo was easier and offered a lot more specific
choices,'' she said. ``I always think of Excite afterwards, and I
can never remember the name of Larcos, or is it Lycos?''
</P>
<P>
   Her search returned 10 entries, listed under ``Business and
Economy. Companies. Apparel. Specialty. Hawaiian.'' She chose the
third one on the list: ``Big Kahuna Hawaiian Shirts''
(www.aloha-bigkahuna.com/bkframe.html).
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``The name jumped out at me,'' she said. ``I associated it
with Hawaiian shirts, although the listing above it was for a
company called Aloha, and that's very Hawaiian, I guess. Big Kahuna
just looked interesting to me.''
</P>
<P>
   The site, however, proved to be not as interesting as its name.
Being a high-end-fabric kind of person, Alesia clicked on one of
five areas offered on the site _ a page pertaining to silk shirts.
</P>
<P>
   ``These don't look like the classic shirt,'' she said. ``But
then again, I hate Hawaiian shirts.''
</P>
<P>
   Interesting to note: using ``Hawaiian shirts,'' plural, turned
up a different set of shops from ``Hawaiian shirt,'' singular.
</P>
<P>
   Though it didn't happen in this case, nuances in keywords often
trip up Web surfers, Vanderbilt noted. Our search expert added,
``The more tenured online users have a better sense of how to
construct the right keyword searches.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Watch your search terms. Try a plural if
singular does not yield what you're looking for.
</P>
<P>
   ASSIGNMENT: CHERRY RED 1965 MUSTANG. Searcher: Brian Stelter of
Damascus, Md. Clicks: seven.
</P>
<P>
   Who better to search for a classic car than a youngster who does
not have his driver's license yet? I asked my online pen pal, Brian
Stelter, 14, to shop for a cherry red '65 Mustang because he's more
into computers than cars, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   Brian started on eBay. ``I thought I had gotten lucky when I
read a listing for '1965 Dark Cherry Red Mustang convertible,''' he
wrote in an e-mail report. ``But I was mistaken: it was only a toy
model.''
</P>
<P>
   He then reverted to Alesia's search engine of choice, Yahoo.
</P>
<P>
   Vanderbilt commented that Yahoo has ``done a good job of
building a brand that means 'Come here to find what you want.'''
</P>
<P>
   For this search, however, that didn't turn out to be the case:
the site led Brian to two Canadian companies selling classic
Mustang replacement parts.
</P>
<P>
   Then he tried another search site, AltaVista, which steered him
to the ``Classic Mustang Message Board''
(www.metromustang.com/classic/wwwboard.htm). Brian reports: ``I
began to hit pay dirt here. '65 Mustang needs good home,' one
message read.'' But no red.
</P>
<P>
   Another site on AltaVista contained car trivia and reprints of
Ford brochures, and another contained links to 22 chapters of the
Mustang Club of America. Still another took Brian to posters of the
elusive car.
</P>
<P>
   Figuring plain old classifieds were his best bet, he clicked on
something called ``Statewide Car Connection''
(www.carbuyer.com/moreinfo.phtml?key(EQ)113332&AMP;s(EQ)stw), which had
also appeared in his AltaVista search.
</P>
<P>
   In seconds, he turned up three Mustangs of the appropriate
vintage and color.
</P>
<P>
   Which one would Brian buy, if he had his druthers and the
appropriate papers? He may be young, but he is pragmatic: ``I would
buy the first one I found, the one with the fire painted on it.
It's cheapest and looks the nicest, plus it's sitting only an hour
away from where I live.''
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Sometimes the best place to look is the most
obvious. As Vanderbilt said, ``What the unique products have going
for them is, if they're tough to find on the Internet, they are
even harder to find off-line.''
</P>
<P>
   ASSIGNMENT: HAMMOCK. Searcher: Vince Napoli of Boca Raton, Fla.
Clicks: six.
</P>
<P>
   A New Yorker who now lives in Boca Raton, Fla., my dad, Vince,
66, is not a hammock sort of person. He hardly sits still. That's
why I assigned him the task of finding the ultimate relaxation
device.
</P>
<P>
   He, too, started with Yahoo, clicking on the search engine's
shopping area. ``They found 451 products in 83 stores,'' he
reported. Some of the hammocks were not the classic backyard
variety. The search page featured a cat hammock and a ferret
hammock, as well as a hammock for fruit, alligators and fish.
</P>
<P>
   Of the four hammock merchants listed, Dad looked at all and
settled on Nicamaka from Nicaragua
(http://store.yahoo.com/buyhammocks/bluebecouphamm.html) for much
the same reason that Alesia chose the store she did: it just felt
right.
</P>
<P>
   He said: ``The site was easy to get around and has good
information and visuals for the products they sell. It lists all
kinds of hammocks for land and boats. And they have a shopping cart
for easy order and list their regular and sales prices.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that Alesia and Vince both responded to sites that
simply caught their eyes ``points to an absence of really good
comparison shopping,'' Vanderbilt said.
</P>
<P>
   E-commerce merchants and Web portals need to be more mindful of
the challenges faced by consumers in conducting a search, and
search engines need to provide deeper data for consumer
decision-making, she said. It takes more than a strong first
impression to drive consumers to a site.
</P>
<P>
   Though fabric hammocks turned out to be more expensive than
rope, Vince said he would opt for the former, particularly a
five-stripe model built for two, for $198.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks like it wouldn't sag after use,'' he said, citing
photographs of people in rope hammocks who appear to be scraping
the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Lesson learned: Virtual shopping is often based on visceral
reactions, just as it is in the brick-and-mortar world.
</P>
<P>
   Postscript
</P>
<P>
   While all three searches were successful, Vanderbilt points out
that the e-commerce guinea pigs were engaged in a very particular
type of shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Such focused searches _ ``intended'' shopping, in industry
parlance _ are what the Web supports best, she said: ``Where
there's huge e-commerce growth opportunity is in changing shopping
behavior and increasing impulse purchases.''
</P>
<P>
   Higher bandwidth will help encourage more people to simply
browse for merchandise online, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Does that mean that coming soon to a computer near you is the
digital equivalent of the checkout-counter tchotchke?

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Businesses have discovered the power of the Internet for
communicating with employees and customers quickly through e-mail
or a Web site. Buying automobile parts, selling books or arranging
vacations can also be done efficiently online. Nonprofit
organizations should find the Internet just as appealing. What
better way to reach like-minded advocates, donors and volunteers or
to coordinate services?
</P>
<P>
   The desire is there, but most nonprofit groups have been slow to
pursue it. There are exceptions, most notably the American Red
Cross, which is planning to develop an online system for its blood
banks; and America's Second Harvest is using the Internet to
distribute food more efficiently. But the vast majority of
charitable organizations, while starting to raise money on their
sites, have been hindered by a lack of money, time, workers and
technological savvy.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the struggles we have had for a long time is that
nonprofits are late adopters in terms of technology,'' said Ken
Goldstein, the director of online community development for
HandsNet, a San Jose, Calif., group that advises human-service
organizations about technology. Goldstein is convinced these groups
need to make more use of the Internet, and argues that being online
is becoming akin to being listed in the telephone directory.
</P>
<P>
   Most nonprofit groups have a long way to go. Catholic Charities
USA, for example, is the largest private network of social service
agencies in the United States. The charity, located in Alexandria,
Va., works with up to 144 major agencies across the country. But
only a third of those agencies have Web sites. ``This is still an
area where we are trying to bring them along,'' said Jo-Ann Leitch,
a spokeswoman for Catholic Charities. ``It's not where they spend a
lot of their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Those furthest behind are the thousands of organizations with
small budgets and limited expertise. ``Most nonprofits are small,
and most small organizations are not networked,'' explained Anthony
Wilhelm, the program director for communications policy for the
Benton Foundation in Washington, D.C., which is active in helping
nonprofit organizations make full use of technology. Many are
unable even to use e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the current enthusiasm for the Web to date has focused
on fund-raising. Many charities' sites allow people to make
donations online. The American Red Cross has had significant
success using its site to raise funds.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, in response to the war in Kosovo, the charity raised
$1.2 million from people who logged on to its site. While that
amount was less than 4 percent of the $34 million raised by the Red
Cross during the crisis, it hinted at what many see as the
potential for electronic fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   But such fund-raising is in its infancy: a survey by Independent
Sector, a Washington, D.C. organization that promotes charitable
giving and volunteerism, found last year that only 1 percent of the
people who gave to charity said they used the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Relatively few charities are using the Internet to communicate
with their members or to deliver services. There are notable
exceptions. America's Second Harvest, the nation's largest
charitable hunger-relief organization, which has a network of
nearly 200 food banks, has developed an e-service called
ResourceLink with Hewlett-Packard. The service, begun in October,
enables corporations to log on and provide information about
donations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be up to date in technology,'' said Deborah Leff,
the president and chief executive of America's Second Harvest,
which is in Chicago. Because so many of its corporate donors use
the Internet to increase efficiency, the charity is exploring how
the medium can help ensure a steady flow of donations and
distribute food more quickly. While some of the agencies the
charity uses do not have access to computers, the hope is that all
the food banks will eventually log on to see if certain available
donations meet their needs.
</P>
<P>
   ResourceLink has made the gathering of information about
donations much simpler. When Nestle donated about 100,000 pounds of
one of its snacks, for example, it provided the necessary details,
including where the donation was located and whom to contact there
online. America's Second Harvest, which was alerted via e-mail to
the donation, placed the donation with six food banks.
</P>
<P>
   There are also plans to adapt the same process to other kinds of
donations, like clothing or building materials, so that the
Internet can serve as a clearinghouse for large gifts, particularly
from corporations.
</P>
<P>
   The American Red Cross is also developing its Internet services.
In addition to maintaining a site about disaster relief,
www.disasterrelief.org, the charity has another site that describes
its charitable work, www.redcross.org, which is considered a very
sophisticated charity site.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Red Cross has such far-flung operations, the
Internet is a perfect medium to communicate national policies and
activities to its roughly 1,500 chapters and local units. The
chapters use the Internet to share information about their
successful activities, according to Tom Woteki, the charity's chief
information officer. The Red Cross is also planning an online
system of blood-supply management and delivery that will help
corporations conduct blood drives and allow doctors to use its
blood supplies better.
</P>
<P>
   But there's more to be done. ``We haven't really scratched the
surface in building a community of volunteers,'' Woteki said.
</P>
<P>
   Developing community via e-mail, chat rooms and private Web
sites is just happening. Many groups, from Amnesty International to
smaller organizations, understand the potential for the Internet as
an advocacy tool. During the height of recent tobacco litigation,
for example, Tobacco Control Advocates ran a private network for
about two years on which several hundred activists could read daily
news bulletins and receive action alerts, allowing quick access to
the news and helping them to coordinate responses.
</P>
<P>
   And the World Wildlife Fund, whose site, www.worldwildlife.org,
is also among the most advanced, uses the Internet for its
Conservation Action Network. About 15,000 of its 1.2 million
members in the United States receive alerts about news in their
areas of interest and ways in which they can try to effect change.
</P>
<P>
   The fund does not plan to offer a more sophisticated site,
though its members coordinate activities, swap information or plan
strategies in the near future, because maintenance would be too
expensive, said Kathleen Nixon, the director of marketing alliances
for the World Wildlife Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have expectations,'' she said. ``We don't have the
resources of Amazon.com.''
</P>
<P>
   Many charities are shocked to discover how expensive the
technology is, because the bulk of the costs are ongoing, said
Michael Gilbert, the director of the Internet Nonprofit Center, an
online resource for charities. ``Nonprofits have just started to
understand the total cost,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many donors, including corporations and foundations, prefer to
see their money go directly to the charity's mission.
``Infrastructure is not the most attractive thing to donors,'' said
Leff, of America's Second Harvest.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the Internet may force changes in the philanthropic
world. Unable to afford the technology to raise money, create
change or provide services, charities that have been reluctant to
work together might have to create alliances to pool their
resources. ``To some extent, the Internet is going to force
collaborations,'' said Gilbert, of the Internet Nonprofit Center.

   Even if you would never dream of auctioning your old blue jeans
on eBay, the person-to-person auction giant, the site may have
already changed the way you will shop in the future. With 10
million registered users at the beginning of the year, eBay has
made the ``going, going, gone'' mentality an integral part of the
online consumer psyche.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just eBay and other sites like Yahoo and Amazon.com
that are running auctions anymore. With the J.C. Penney Co.'s
announcement in January that it will begin auctioning close-out
goods and excess inventory online this spring, it looks as if major
retailers are deciding to adopt the auction format as part of their
e-commerce strategies.
</P>
<P>
   J.C. Penney isn't the first retailer to go this route _ it's
just the biggest. Over the last year or two, retailers like the
Sharper Image Co. and Lands' End have instituted auction components
as part of their e-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   Computer hardware and software have also traditionally been a
popular auction product, and niche sites auctioning everything from
wine to repossessed cars to racing pigeons have been cropping up
since Internet time immemorial, which is to say about five years
(eBay was started in 1995).
</P>
<P>
   But J.C. Penney's move validates what analysts have predicted:
auctions are becoming a must-have feature for business-to-consumer
e-commerce. According to Evie Black Dykema, an analyst at Forrester
Research, which studies technology-related markets, J.C. Penney's
decision ``means department stores have started to think of
auctions as part of their retail arsenal.''
</P>
<P>
   That means e-commerce could start to look more and more like a
bazaar, at least for some brand-new items.
</P>
<P>
   Richard E. Last, executive vice president for J.C. Penney's
e-commerce division, explained the thinking behind offering goods
for auction. ``It's customer-friendly, fun and engaging _ that's
the main motivator,'' he said. He echoed a common theme: retail
auctioneers just want to have fun. While business-to-business
auctions may soon involve bigger money, business-to-consumer
auctions are big marketing.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is that once consumers have gotten the bidding bug,
they will go to auctions as much for the thrill of the chase as to
obtain an item. The retailers hope they will keep coming back _
even when they want to buy something the old-fashioned way, at full
price.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant Hilton, a spokesman for Dellauction.com, which has been
auctioning Dell computer products since July, said that Dell
started its auction site because it was looking for more
interaction with its customers. The more Dell can offer a customer
between systems purchases, ``the more loyal the customer will be,
and we'll hang on to them longer,'' Hilton said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam Sarner, an analyst with the Gartner Group, which
specializes in Internet-related market research _ who acknowledged
that he recently caught auction fever himself and splurged on a
swatch of retro ``Star Wars'' wallpaper on eBay _ said that
business-to-consumer auctions were ``a marketing rather than a
business model.'' But, he added, ``sales and marketing do go hand
in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   The entertainment factor accounts for some of the splashier
auctions that took place last year, like Amazon's ``Melrose Place''
memorabilia auction. However, the much-touted ``excitement
building'' factor can sometimes be absurd. Sharper Image, for
example, reports selling a $100 gift certificate for more than that
when it went on the auction block.
</P>
<P>
   For retailers, the happy coincidence of such excitement is that
auctions can be a good way to get rid of liquidation items. J.C.
Penney will use its site to auction close-out goods like
electronics, home furnishings and clothing. Retailers hope that
auctions will get them a higher price for surplus goods than the
straight sale-rack approach.
</P>
<P>
   David Lucking-Reiley, a professor of economics at Vanderbilt
University who studies online auctions, said: ``Auctioning
close-out goods makes sense from an economics perspective. If a
retailer has goods that aren't selling for the price they are set
at, it makes sense to put them up for auction, rather than guess
what price to mark them down to, because the retailer could guess
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   As department stores and big retailers get ready to take the
auction plunge, auction software and service providers are rushing
to provide them with the kind of branded site they can't get on
eBay. ``The business-to-consumer market was eBay's to lose _ and
they seem, amazingly, like they're going to lose it,'' Dykema said.
``They treat Fortune 500 companies like they were flea-market
stands.'' As a result, she added, big companies are either building
their own sites or having sites built for them.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers running auctions need to generate enough traffic to
make an auction worthwhile, though _ something that is easy to do
on eBay but harder on a single store's site. FairMarket Inc., the
company that is running Dell's auction site and will run J.C.
Penney's, has approached this problem by signing deals to share
items and ``eyeballs'' (potential bidders) across more than 100
sites, including portals like MSN, Excite and Lycos, and retail
sites like Ticketmaster Online.
</P>
<P>
   OpenSite Technologies Inc., a provider of auction software,
recently acquired Bidder's Edge Inc., a so-called auction bot that
scours different auction sites. OpenSite will be able to send
Bidder's Edge traffic to its own retail customers' auctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the future, Dr. Lucking-Reiley says, restaurants may auction
Tuesday-night dinners for less than Friday-night meals, and movie
theaters might auction off seats so that movie houses aren't empty
on sunny Wednesday afternoons.
</P>
<P>
   But does all this mean that, in a couple of years, we'll log on
before we go home at night and haggle for the best price for
hamburger meat? The short answer is: Probably not.
</P>
<P>
   Anne Perlman, president of Maoi Technologies, an auction
software provider that works mostly with business-to-business
auction sites, said: ``I don't think that when I go to the grocery
store I want to negotiate iceberg lettuce because the convenience
will be more important than the price. You're paying for timing and
delivery.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts predict that in the future, computer hardware will
remain a mainstay of the online auction world and that travel
packages, automobiles, apparel and goods like software, flowers,
toys, sporting goods and books should catch up. In most cases,
these items are already being auctioned in pockets on the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lucking-Reiley's view may ultimately be the bottom line:
``An economist would say, 'If someone wants to pay for it, it must
be good.'''

 By DOUGLAS FRANTZ 
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   Early last year, John F. Welch, the chief executive and chairman
of General Electric, set an ambitious goal for the managers of the
huge company's businesses _ establish a strategy for using the
Internet and put it into effect before the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 of GE's departments, from airplane engines to appliances
to industrial systems, met the goal that the company, long the
leader of the old economy, had set as part of its ferocious battle
to transform itself into a leader of the new economy.
</P>
<P>
   The company's speedy adaptation would not have been so
remarkable if it were another dot-com start-up or a small computer
company. But General Electric is the world's largest non-technology
company, a manufacturing and financial-services giant with $112
billion in revenue last year and 340,000 employees in about 100
countries.
</P>
<P>
   Working in teams and sharing information across the company's
global span, GE developed novel ways to do everything from speeding
up the overhaul of jet engines to buying a staple gun.
</P>
<P>
   Through the Internet, GE industrial engineers on three
continents can meet to discuss new products. Customers can go
online to buy GE mutual funds or analyze the cost and benefits of
upgrading the turbines at a generating plant.
</P>
<P>
   GE was not the first manufacturing company to adapt to the Web,
but the lessons it has been learning are more likely to affect the
rest of the industrial sector and beyond. GE has developed much of
its own Web software, but has also hired other companies to help.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are being smart because they are going after the Internet
in a hundred different directions,'' said William J. Fiala, an
analyst at the brokerage firm Edward D. Jones &AMP; Co., in St. Louis.
``They are big enough and rich enough to afford to take their
swings, knowing that they are going to hit a few home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, GE has learned a few things that could apply to
any business interested in the Web. Early on, for instance, the
company determined that simply listing products and services on a
Web site, a technique known as ``brochureware,'' is not very
helpful to customers, said Gary M. Reiner, the senior vice
president who is overseeing the company's Internet strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the company has developed interactive Web sites that
allow customers to buy goods and services, track their orders,
compare various products and tap into GE's technical expertise.
</P>
<P>
   The company also learned that an organizational structure based
on geography should not simply be transferred to a Web site. When
the site for GE's plastics business was unveiled last spring, there
were separate sections for the Americas, Europe and Asia. But
customers did not care about those divisions, so the site was
reorganized by products and services.
</P>
<P>
   One technique GE executives say has worked is the creation of
``wizards'' that enable customers to solve complex problems on the
Web. A design engineer at a manufacturing company, for example, can
log on to the GE plastics site and use a specialized engineering
calculator to determine a polycarbonate's strength, adhesion and
color.
</P>
<P>
   When the GE aircraft-engines business wanted to expand its share
of the maintenance and overhaul market, it adapted diagnostic tools
used on GE medical-imaging equipment to a site that company
executives say has sharply cut the time and cost of engine repairs.
</P>
<P>
   One important decision in overhauling such engines is whether to
retain, rebuild or discard a worn part. In pre-Web days, the part
in question was often sent to the customer to be evaluated before
it was installed, or the repairs had to wait until a customer's
representative could inspect it at GE, processes that could take
days or weeks. Today, a clear picture of the part can be
transmitted over the Internet and quickly evaluated by the
customer.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of GE's Internet innovations are aimed at its customers.
The industrial systems business, which supplies equipment to
distribute, operate and control electricity, has developed a
virtual city on the Web where its engineers, who are in 100
countries, can share ideas and information and work on projects
simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   When employees go to the site, known as WebCity, they see
three-dimensional images of the city's buildings, including a
library, where information is stored; a university, where training
classes are available; and a factory, where products are developed.
</P>
<P>
   There is even a City Hall, with its own mayor, Chris Fuselier,
who happens to be the general manager of technology for the
industrial systems business. He and his staff, which includes a
``zoning board,'' set the agenda for WebCity. Fuselier, who has
been at GE for 31 years, says the site acts as a tool for tying
together a worldwide business. Tasks that once required airplane
trips and telephone calls across time zones are now accomplished in
less time and at less cost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arrangement breaks down barriers of time and location,''
Fuselier said. ``We've gone from a traditional 10-hour workday to
where we are pretty much able to operate 24 hours a day, seven days
a week.''
</P>
<P>
   In developing its Internet strategies, GE is trying to turn the
Web into a profit center as well as a cost cutter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, a procurement employee who needs to buy staple guns
can go to a GE site and search for vendors from whom the company
has agreed to buy such items at a predetermined price. The employee
enters the kind and number of guns wanted, and the order is
processed. If the order is big enough to require approval, an
e-mail message is automatically sent to a supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   Reiner says consultants estimated that the cost of placing an
order used to be $50 to $200, but the cost via the Web site is only
about $1.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to saving money on its own purchases by using the
Web, GE formed a venture with the Thomas Publishing Co. to sell the
service to other businesses. So far, Reiner said, there are about
10 customers, including Boeing and 3M.
</P>
<P>
   As part of its effort to develop e-businesses as alternatives to
traditional brick-and-mortar operations, the company created two
new companies early in March. One of them, GE Global eXchange
Services, will provide Internet data exchange. The other, GE
Systems Services, will provide the operations infrastructure to
support e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Measuring gains in productivity from using the Internet has
proved elusive, as it has for other e-commerce businesses. Fuselier
thinks he and his team from industrial systems have at least part
of the answer. Based on 600 projects that have been completed
during the first five months of WebCity's operation, Fuselier said,
the time it takes to develop a product has been cut 20 percent.

 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   ``Good afternoon, Anthony Dunne's office _ I'll see if Mr.
Dunne's available.''
</P>
<P>
   I pressed the hold button.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony!'' I shouted toward the open bathroom. ``It's Thomas
O'Brien!''
</P>
<P>
   There was excitement in my voice about the return call from
O'Brien, the hot interior designer, but I added, ``Once in a while,
could you please close the door?''
</P>
<P>
   Our communal office bathroom was adjacent to our main working
space, our 276-square-foot living room.
</P>
<P>
   That was where we set up shop last spring when, at 45, my
husband, Tony Dunne, gave up the security of the insecure movie
business, where he was the set builder on films such as ``Die Hard
With a Vengeance'' (1995) and ``Ransom'' (1997), to pursue an
Internet idea: the first virtual interior-design center.
</P>
<P>
   For more than 15 years, Tony had informally designed interiors
for family members, friends and people in the movie business. Last
May, he was designing two apartments when he returned home from a
long day spent in the maze of furniture showrooms.
</P>
<P>
   He sat on the couch and said, ``I've been thinking.''
</P>
<P>
   In great detail, he laid out his idea for HauteDecor.com, which
would bring together about 20 top interior designers and have each
create virtual rooms, in which everything would be for sale.
</P>
<P>
   The site would offer the best of home furnishings and
accessories to designers as well as consumers. Shoppers could
choose from thousands of items selected by design professionals.
</P>
<P>
   It would be like shopping in New York or London from your office
or living room. It would be like looking at a magazine and being
inside the rooms. Rather than turn to the back of a magazine for
information, visitors could click on the item and find what they
needed.
</P>
<P>
   Though I knew little about the Internet and e-commerce, I knew I
was hearing a good idea. I also knew that it was perfect for Tony
because it would use his film background, computer skills _
computers have been used in set design for years _ business acumen
and knowledge of interior design.
</P>
<P>
   And it was a grownup idea. It would never occur to a kid playing
videos and eating Cheetos at an Internet incubator.
</P>
<P>
   As I studied Tony's diagrams for the site, I knew I could help
him execute the concept. As a writer, I had always worked under
enormous pressure with brutal deadlines. I found it all fun. We
both did.
</P>
<P>
   And so I offered my services and became Tony's first employee:
assistant and messenger.
</P>
<P>
   To both of us, the e-commerce and movie businesses seemed
similar. Both required tremendous manpower, equipment and money, as
well as highly complex tasks, all in a compressed time frame. That
was crucial to making the transition for us. We simply applied our
movie skills to the Web.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is the script _ it had better be great. The venture
capitalists who provide the money are the studio executives. The
teams who get the site running are the teams who make a movie. The
Web site is the movie. The site's debut is the release.
</P>
<P>
   Even the big egos are the same. The business people think they
are most important _ the creative people know the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Both businesses thrive on gossip and on people spewing opinions
with great authority. The accumulated knowledge does not add up to
much: Columbia Pictures passed on ``E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial''
(1982), even with Steven Spielberg involved. Bill Gates, among
others, was decidedly cool about the Internet's future but has
since changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   People talk as if they know. Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
   Once we started to execute the idea, it turned out to be as hard
as we had thought it would be _ which means that you really had no
idea how hard it would be, and your naivete is the only thing you
have going for you.
</P>
<P>
   You actually believe it is going to get easier, and so when it
keeps getting tougher and reaches the point where it has taken over
your life, you still believe that it is going to lighten up. That
is before you find yourself stopping at Banana Republic to buy
socks and underwear on the way to a meeting, or stealing toilet
paper from a friend's hotel room because that is one item the
coffee shop doesn't deliver.
</P>
<P>
   As in a movie, you are behind before you begin. My original deal
with Tony had been six hours in the afternoons for $20 an hour, off
the books. By Week 2, I was working 14 hours a day, and the guy was
not coughing up the dough. Oh, this is the movie business, all
right _ everyone lies.
</P>
<P>
   Just wait it out. There comes a time when you are indispensable,
and then you've got them. As we refined the concept, Tony and I saw
the need for editorial content, which helps drive people to the
site and keeps them there. And so I was offered the job of
HauteDecor's editorial director. I would have been a whole lot
nicer about my deal had he paid me when I was an assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Money is always the hardest part. We chose to take what in film
is called the studio route. The nature and scope of the project
required financing from a large venture-capital firm. Because we
did not know anyone at such a firm, we spoke to every single friend
we have.
</P>
<P>
   My most important recommendation: Do not be coy _ no one
appreciates it. If I thought a friend could somehow help, I started
the call with, ``I need a favor.''
</P>
<P>
   Do not ask about their kids or their work or their last
vacation. This is business. They will respect you for that, even if
they cannot help.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last eight months, Tony and I have made easily 1,000
calls and met with countless friends, acquaintances and strangers
whom we found through friends and acquaintances. A little buzz
started, and people started calling us. Most conversations went
nowhere, but a few were exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   That is how we found financing. Other people might have a more
sophisticated strategy, but this one worked for us.
</P>
<P>
   We identified two people who we believed were serious. Tony met
with the first one several times. Together, on a Sunday morning, we
met with the second at the Carlyle Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast, Tony laid out his HauteDecor plan for
entrepreneur Kevin Kinsella and his wife, Tamara. Thirty minutes
into breakfast _ and 29 minutes after his eyes told me he was
hooked _ Kevin said he wanted in on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   He said he would provide the $1 million seed capital needed to
get the idea moving. He made a commitment to help raise, in stages,
at least $25 million to $30 million, which is what he and Tony
determined it would cost to execute the site. He laid out the
deal's terms, and the firms and people he would ask for money. We
were familiar with a number of them.
</P>
<P>
   Back at our base, Tony returned to command central: the couch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you think he's for real?'' he asked, knowing the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yeah,'' I said, knowing that my next words would determine
our future. Tony would not go forward without my support. ``Let's
do it,'' I said, but not in a silly, gung-ho way.
</P>
<P>
   On July 1, Kevin wired the initial $500,000 to the HauteDecor
account. A month later, we moved ourselves and four new employees
from our living room into a 2,500-square-foot space in the Flatiron
district of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   In the movie business, when every element is in place and
everyone is betting on success, the production is given a green
light. That's where we are now.
</P>
<P>
   With financing mainly from the Institutional Venture
Partners/Redpoint, we will spend the next five months continuing to
create and build the Web site, form alliances, work with
manufacturers and designers, write editorial content and perform a
long list of other tasks with the other employees, who seem to
arrive on a daily basis.
</P>
<P>
   By the time we begin in August, there will be 120 of us in an
18,000-square-foot space, 62 times the size of our living room,
where this venture started as a conversation between two people.

   The roads in Gansu, China, are sometimes barely roads. Bathrooms
are pits in the ground. Fur coats are a necessity, not fashion. In
a nod to tradition, and for self-defense, some men travel with
swords at their sides.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, thanks to modem connections and the efforts of local
entrepreneurs, the Internet is trickling into back alleys and
basements of the most remote regions of western China. A nationwide
system of local Internet service providers was completed last year,
and now the seven westernmost provinces _ half of China's land,
with 20 percent of its population _ account for 5 percent of the
country's Internet use.
</P>
<P>
   So, when in early January I set out with my backpack and no
itinerary for a seven-week trek through the mountains and deserts
of western China, e-mail was the intercontinental umbilical cord
that tethered me to my anxious mother, 12,000 miles away in New
York. From Inner Mongolia to Kashgar to Lhasa, I hunted for the
elusive wang ba, or ``Net bar,'' to send reassuring updates.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are better left out of such dispatches,
incidentally: I did not tell my mother about the time my bus almost
slipped off an icy mountain road, or about another bus that fell
off a cliff outside Lhasa, killing 12 people.
</P>
<P>
   In the one-room Net bar in Kashgar, where eight personal
computers were strung together with a tangle of wires, the
coal-burning stove, spewing black smoke, was not enough to keep my
fingers from becoming too cold to type.
</P>
<P>
   In the monastery town of Xiahe, in Gansu Province, Internet
users look out the window at the mule-drawn carts and the nomadic
herdsmen who trudge along the town's one main street, oblivious to
the information revolution.
</P>
<P>
   While the Internet may be a web of dreams, China is a country of
stark realities. Like its roads and infrastructure, China's
Internet is being sewn together piecemeal and unevenly, but it is
coming together.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on where you go and whom you ask, China is alternately
prosperous or poor, cutting-edge modern or heart-achingly backward.
</P>
<P>
   Multinational corporations salivate over magazine images of
Levi-clad adolescents eating at the McDonald's in Shanghai and
talking on their Nokia cell phones. But that slice of the
demographic pie is very slim and very urban. More than two-thirds
of China's 1.2 billion people are rural, and the overwhelming
majority of that rural population is poor.
</P>
<P>
   Roughly 45 percent of China's Internet users live in Shanghai,
Beijing or in the affluent province of Guangdong, which together
account for only 8 percent of the country's total population.
Approximately 80 percent of users live in large cities.
</P>
<P>
   Almost 80 percent are men, and 85 percent are 18 to 35,
according to a government-sponsored survey by the China Internet
Network Information Center. Few rural residents can afford
computers or the fees charged by their local Internet bars, the
equivalent of $2.50 to $4 an hour. Urban Internet bars are cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet presence reflects these disparities. A wang ba can
be a sleek mirrored club, with uniformed attendants bringing tea to
customers at their computers, or a dirt-floor hovel where men
huddle under dim lighting. Beyond larger cities, wang-ba customers
are largely foreign tourists seeking quaint, traditional villages
but demanding modern communications services.
</P>
<P>
   Many wang bas use the names Hotmail and Yahoo as synonyms for
Internet access on their store signs. These services' increasing
presence is leading the way for infiltration of the Internet
throughout the underdeveloped areas of China.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, local residents who go to wang bas seem more
interested in the multiplayer video games than in the potential for
revolutionizing commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Jin, who owns Tim's Internet Cafe in Dali, in Yunnan
Province, estimates that 95 percent of his customers are
foreigners, 4 percent come from other parts of China and less than
1 percent are local residents.
</P>
<P>
   As for e-commerce, Jin says, a number of the communities
surrounding Dali still do their purchasing and bargaining at weekly
outdoor markets.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way we can do an e-commerce site here,'' he says, citing
the lack of infrastructure in Yunnan, the difficulty of
transportation and the low population density. ``In big cities and
through foreign mail-order companies, maybe. Locally, there's no
way.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Tibetan capital of Lhasa, which is not connected to China
by railroad, Tsering Tashi opened the Khang Li Internet Bar as soon
as Tibet established an Internet service provider last year. He
says it was the only Tibetan-owned Internet bar in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
   Within 10 months, he says, he recovered his original investment
of almost $10,000. Still, nearly all of his customers are tourists.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tibetans almost never use high technology _ they don't
understand it,'' Tashi says. ``They have heard of the Internet, but
the Internet cafe is a wholly new concept to them.''
</P>
<P>
   In the offseason, October through February, he converts most of
his Internet cafe into a clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Sluggish connections are a problem throughout China. In
mid-February, Jin closed his cafe for two days because the Internet
was too slow, particularly the e-mail provider Hotmail, which 80
percent of his customers use.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, China is changing rapidly, and so is the Internet.
Entrepreneurs say they are optimistic that logistical obstacles can
be overcome.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate profits in China have historically been elusive.
Ask any multinational corporation that has set up shop in China in
the last decade, eager to tap into the billion-customer market.
Most companies are still waiting for the investments to pay off.
</P>
<P>
   Plagued by distribution difficulties, inflated estimates of
demand and bureaucratic red tape, more businesses are leaving
China, deciding that the market can wait.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, profits in e-commerce are elusive as well, though
not only in China. E-business opportunities in China could
therefore prove to be doubly difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But low costs and tourists' cash, it turns out, can become a
very workable, albeit modest, business plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our fundamental goal is to make money,'' Tashi says. ``So far,
the Internet has been very good for making money.''

 By ALLEN R. MYERSON  
 c.2000 The New York Times  
<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   STAMFORD, Conn. _ Priceline.com does not even look like your
normal dot-com company. Its headquarters are not in Silicon Valley,
but in a suburban office park. Instead of 20-somethings in jeans
and T-shirts with long hair and short resumes, many of its
inhabitants are gray-haired recruits from companies like Citigroup
and AT&AMP;T. Some wear neat, casual clothes, while others wear suits.
</P>
<P>
   Looks are not deceiving. For all its e-commerce, new-economy
credentials, Priceline wants to be a member of the Old World
corporate club. Instead of battling older, more traditional
companies, Jay S. Walker, its 46-year-old founder and largest
shareholder, and his lieutenants have turned them into partners and
allies. If he does well, he says, so will Delta Airlines, American
Airlines, AT&AMP;T, A&AMP;P, D'Agostino's, Pathmark, the National and
Budget car rental companies and the Ford Motor Co.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't compete against these companies,'' Walker said at his
office. ``We don't seek to own an airline. We don't seek to be a
car dealer. We don't seek to be a grocery store. We don't seek to
be a phone company. We seek to improve the profitability of our
partners rather than cannibalize it.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead of conducting auctions with rising bids, Priceline
allows a buyer to propose a price that the seller, whether of
airline tickets or orange juice, can choose to accept or reject.
Translated into Pricelinese, this approach comes out as the slogan
``Name Your Own Price.''
</P>
<P>
   For all Priceline's establishment stripes, what Walker has in
mind is more radical than eBay, pushing a strategy that is becoming
more important throughout e-commerce: partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, when customers call up a Web site, they see a
single entrance to a structure made up of many businesses in a
tangle of alliances and subsidies. Entrepreneurs like Walker
concentrate on what they do best, finding partners for everything
else.
</P>
<P>
   ``We distribute prices, not products,'' Walker said, his bushy
eyebrows rising and falling for emphasis. Priceline, he said, is
demonstrating how the Web can introduce a new series of
relationships between seller and buyer. ``You can't wheel a grocery
cart down the aisle and have AT&AMP;T say, `You know what? I'll pay for
all the meat in your grocery cart if you'll try our long-distance
service for 7 cents a minute.' The Net allows for far richer, far
more customized, instantaneously creative partnering.''
</P>
<P>
   In general, Priceline's target is not the customer who wants
favorite grocery brands delivered to the door, who wants to fly
direct flights at reasonable hours and stay in favorite hotels. All
those desires are served well by other companies and Web sites.
Priceline targets the bargain hunter.
</P>
<P>
   Stores like Wal-Mart manage to offer low prices partly by using
their size to win special breaks from their suppliers. Walker does
not. He wants sellers to have the flexibility to lower their
prices, then raise them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not use our size to try to extract concessionary
prices,'' he said. ``Sellers like us because they can use us to
balance supply and demand in a constantly changing business.''
</P>
<P>
   But isn't Walker dishing out some unrealistic bargains? Yes, he
said, at least for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The model in every business is subsidize first to build
traffic,'' he said. ``Every business spends money to acquire
customers. It's every grand-opening sale that has ever existed.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts like Henry Blodget, at Merrill Lynch, remain optimistic
about Priceline's prospects, but they also wonder what will happen
when the grand-opening sale ends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is what happens when the discounts narrow and the
consumers won't be getting such a great deal,'' Blodget said.
</P>
<P>
   Walker said that Priceline will be able to sustain attractive
discounts. Bidding and buying through Priceline, he said, can
involve a deal with up to five parties: Priceline, the customer, a
retailer like a grocery store, a manufacturer or a service
provider, and the provider of an unrelated service like
long-distance calling or credit cards or magazine subscriptions.
</P>
<P>
   The issuer of Discover cards, for instance, will add $30 to
Priceline customers' bids for airline tickets if they apply for the
cards. Another $5 from Discover goes to Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   The corporate partners are so important to Walker that he often
identifies them, not his online buyers, as his true market, as when
he said, ``We're not here to compete with our customers.''
</P>
<P>
   His office seems like a shrine to those partners-cum-customers.
Against an incongruous background of bookshelves filled with
leather-bound classics, he displays dozens of packages _ Cheerios,
Dove soap, Joy dishwashing detergent _ and model jets.
</P>
<P>
   So strong is Walker's belief in his strategy's distinctiveness
that he has taken out several patents, recorded on plaques that
line a Priceline.com hallway, to protect his business processes. He
has sued Microsoft, maintaining that it has infringed on Priceline,
a contention Microsoft strongly disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether this strategy will benefit consumers or investors once
consumers exhaust their specials and Wall Street starts demanding
profits is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Wall Street's passion remains strong. Though Lauren
Cooks Levitan, an analyst at Robertson Stephens, raises questions
about how many industries will be receptive to Walker's approach,
she praises the concept.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Jay stands apart as a real visionary,'' she said. ``He
isn't just trying to shift market share online, but develop a whole
new business model.''
</P>
<P>
   The Priceline strategy has been applied to hotel rooms, rental
cars, mortgages, groceries, new cars, castoff household appliances
and, as announced just last month, gasoline, but it will not work
everywhere. Given the opportunity to offer name-your-own-terms
credit cards, many major issuers have balked, as have some large
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft Foods, a unit of Philip Morris and the nation's largest
maker of packaged foods, has also balked. So for the time being,
shoppers who want Kool-Aid, Jell-O, Post cereals, Maxwell House
coffee, Kraft cheeses or Oscar Mayer hot dogs cannot order through
Priceline.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not participating,'' said Moyra Knight, a spokeswoman
for Kraft. ``We just need a better understanding of their
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Airline tickets, the closest thing to a certifiable success for
Priceline, have features that suit the company's strategy, a point
Walker readily confirmed. Airlines have to unload a highly
perishable inventory, seats that would otherwise be empty, at low
prices, without sacrificing revenue from business travelers and
others willing to pay high prices. Priceline allows the airlines to
find travelers willing to accept inconvenient connections and
departure times in return for a bargain.
</P>
<P>
   Just as clothing stores do not usually post signs telling
shoppers about their outlets, airlines do not play up their
Priceline partnerships. American Airlines, for example, refused to
comment.
</P>
<P>
   But other partners see so many benefits, and so few risks, that
they are happy to voice their praise.
</P>
<P>
   ``The stores like it and the customers seem to be happy,'' said
Nick D'Agostino III, a vice president at D'Agostino Supermarkets
Inc. of New York. Priceline allows his stores to sell groceries
over the Web at no extra cost to them, he said, because the
manufacturers provide the discounts and the customers pick up the
groceries themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Walker came to his big idea in stages. As a student at Cornell
University, he was sued by Parker Brothers to prevent him from
publishing a guide to winning at Monopoly, and watched the weekly
newspaper he started in Ithaca, N.Y., collapse under competition
from a local daily owned by the Gannett Co. chain.
</P>
<P>
   ``As you become more experienced in business, you learn that
picking a fight is usually the last thing you want to do,'' he
said. ``War is the ultimate failure of diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   When Priceline began operating in April 1998, inviting customers
to propose prices for airline tickets, its diplomacy led to the
signing of only two, relatively meek carriers: TWA and America
West. Securing major airlines as partners took money, in the form
of Priceline shares.
</P>
<P>
   That summer, Delta Airlines agreed to sell its tickets on
Priceline's Web site in return for, among other goodies, rights to
buy millions of shares for nearly nothing. Other major airlines
followed, with American and United also receiving Priceline stakes,
although smaller. The total cost to Priceline _ if not in cash, in
the ability to raise it _ is about $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts were understanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way they could have primed the pump without doing
that,'' Blodget said. Walker, saying that such concessions are not
habit forming, said that he has not had to give equity stakes to
any other partners.
</P>
<P>
   And if Priceline initially subsidized the tickets, paying the
airlines more than it was receiving from customers, the company is
paying less now. Marketing expenses, including those television
advertisements with the actor William Shatner, still leave
Priceline with heavy but narrowing losses.
</P>
<P>
   Will the strategy work? The results, so far, are unclear. But it
is a strategy distinct from the backward-looking approaches to
selling over the Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not just catalogs online,'' Walker said. ``That's not
the future of e-commerce.''
</P>

 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   A gerbil shot from a cannon, a hammy actor crooning a song
woefully off key, a college student who burps the alphabet: These
were just a few of the colorful images used in the past year by
dot-com companies flooding the airwaves with ``edgy'' advertising.
</P>
<P>
   To analyze why dot-com advertisements are so wild, whether they
work and where they go from here, a group of advertisers _ some old
hands, some new faces _ and dot-com clients, including one, Michael
Zapolin, who appeared in his own Super Bowl ad, assembled recently
in New York, watched one another's commercials and exchanged views.
The moderator was Warren Berger, a contributing editor at Wired and
editor of the advertising magazine One.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WARREN BERGER &LR;  _ So many dot-com ads, including the ones we
just looked at, seem to feature off-the-wall humor, outrageous
situations, quirky celebrities. Why do these offbeat approaches
seem to be popular?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MICHAEL ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ With all the names out there, even if you
have a really hot name, you still have to burn that into somebody's
brain _ so that a day later, a week later, when they need what you
were talking about, they can recall what you were doing. There's
not a lot of ways to burn something into the brain unless it's just
totally nuts.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ELLIS VERDI &LR;  _ I'm concerned, though, because half of the
dot-com ads, I don't even know what they're selling; I don't know
what the benefits are to them. At some point I've got to understand
what advantage the site offers to me.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROY GRACE &LR;  _ I agree a lot of them sacrifice relevance for
impact, but when I see a gerbil shot out of a cannon, I never
forget it.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ROBERT BOWMAN &LR;  _ We were the first to do the ``Look, ma, no
hands'' advertising, really. We were relatively new to this. And we
got an A in Marketing 101: Get your name out there. But we didn't
tell them what we do and why it's important. So this past
Christmas, we ran ads that talked about overnight free delivery.
Our traffic doubled and our sales tripled.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GEORGE PARKER &LR;  _ But many of these spots are not aimed at the
end-user anyway. They're aimed at the investment community. And all
they need to know is your name, not what you're selling.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ It goes beyond just somebody coming to your site and
buying product. We had four segments to kill. No. 1, consumers
coming to the site. No. 2, the Wall Street community. They're
sitting there and the ad comes on TV and the guy's wife says, ``Are
you taking them public?'' And he says, ``I don't know, I'll call
them tomorrow.'' And then there's the individual investor _ in the
dot-com space, it's 80 percent individual investors, wanting to
know, ``Can I put money into your company?'' And then fourth,
partner companies who want to advertise on the site. It would have
taken us a year and a half to go out and see all these people.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ But at some point, somebody's going to say, ``I can't
give you another dollar until you show me some level of
accountability.'' And the accountability has to be in the
marketplace.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; SHERI BARON &LR;  _ I'm sure everyone in this room has sat with
venture capitalists and presented the big idea to them. And they're
not measuring advertising in the traditional way _ because they are
not advertising people. To be honest with you, I don't want a
venture capitalist responsible for developing my advertising
strategy. But at that moment, all bets are off and everybody is
playing different roles.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ How involved do the V.C.'s get? To the point of
vetoing ads?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ It depends on the company, whether it's a well-funded
dot-com start-up in Phase 2, or still in Phase 1.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ I think the V.C.'s are going to learn their lessons,
too. You can see it already. At one time, $25, $30 million was easy
to get. Now it's $15 to $20.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Is it difficult to find the balance between creating
an entertaining commercial like the ones we saw and giving the
basics for consumers _ what is this dot-com, how is it different
from 16 others?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ The basic rules apply. People don't come home at night
to watch the commercials, so it behooves you to make them
entertaining _ whether it's a dot-com, soap, an automobile. Even
more so now, because there's this fierce competition for air. In
the history of the world, have there ever been so many new
companies? There's this wonderful, manic desperation.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ It's a very exciting time, but I also think that it's
a chance for agencies to be irresponsible. All of a sudden a
creative person who's always been told they can't do this or that
has newfound creative freedom.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Putting aside the investor audience, are most of
these ads targeting a younger audience? Does that explain why
there's so much of a certain style of humor, such as the campy
William Shatner ads?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; DAVID WECAL &LR;  _ Actually, we're very serious about that stuff.
The truth is, I think mainstream America is pretty edgy. If you
look at the Priceline work, you can say it's a little out there.
But here's a campaign that was talked about on the ``Today'' show,
on ``Entertainment Tonight'' _ it was interesting to mass culture.
I think we underestimate middle America in terms of, like, how edgy
their humor is.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Bob, let me ask you, what exactly was the effect of
that ``gerbils'' campaign on the business?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ Traffic spiked way up in December of '98. We had
37,000 new customers when the gerbil ads were flourishing. But of
those 37,000, only 8,000 came back to buy over the next 10 months.
In the holidays of '99 _ when we were running our boring ad about
overnight free delivery _ we had 100,000 new customers. Of those,
already 35,000 have come back. So by telling people what we did, we
got visitors who actually might become customers. We did the
outrageous stuff, and obviously Priceline's ads have been edgy. But
we finally retreated and said, ``We have to tell people what the
value proposition is,'' whereas Priceline has sort of kept with the
same edginess _ they've still not told people that stuff is really
cheap.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ David, will there be a second phase to that campaign?
Do you envision it as something that will evolve, where you'll have
less of Shatner singing and more information?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WECAL &LR;  _ I think he dances in the sequel. No, we're doing a
second round, but _ you know, there is a balance. I guess I'm going
to answer Bob's question with another question. When you switched
back to more responsible advertising, did you feel like you were
changing the image of your company?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ We were worried about that. In '98 our ads were
outrageous and our site was colossally boring. In '99 our ads were
boring and our site was interesting and fun _ so we tried to keep
the edginess in our site, figuring the ads won't be as irreverent.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ In truth, this business is a direct business. There
may be some mass businesses like a Priceline, but, in the end, it's
not like all of a sudden, overnight, we have quadrupled the
capacity for consumers to buy things. So one of the things that's
going to happen is that once we get past this first stage of
getting your financing and getting your name out there, then it
becomes a business like everything else. You have to go out there
and see who your customers are and then refine your targeting as
you move on. You may not be in mass television all the time telling
your story.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Mike, what kind of traffic did the Super Bowl ad
generate _ and how did it taper off in the weeks afterward?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ We had about 500,000 people come through within 24
to 48 hours. What happened was, it spiked real hard, and then it
came down pretty hard _ but before the ad we were running at a few
thousand people a day; now we're over tens of thousands of people.
But aside from traffic, I got a call from every investment bank on
Wall Street, and I'm raising money right now at 10 times what I
raised my first round. I mean, you know, so much money that it's
ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ As Mike points out, when you spike up to another
level with a big ad campaign, it's temporary _ but when it settles
back down, it doesn't go all the way back down. Because with
everyone you capture, you keep moving to different plateaus and
that's the game. Once we rope somebody in, and they've looked at
our site and particularly if they've been a customer, we now have
their e-mail address; we know who they are. So we don't necessarily
have to rely on mass media to keep people coming back.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ One thing that we found from the Super Bowl, it was
like we could do this giant focus group where half a million people
came into our site and told us what they really wanted. We just
watched where they went and what they looked for.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ But I have a question about these advertising
budgets. I recently read about a $25 million advertising account of
a dot-com company aimed at serious marathon runners _ of which
there cannot be more than 50,000 in the entire U.S. If you do the
math, these people are maybe going to go through a pair of shoes a
month, a few pairs of shorts, socks. So where does this $25 million
budget become justified?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WECAL &LR;  _ They all say they have $25 million.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ Yeah, I know, but a lot of them do. And of course
it's V.C. money to go in and capture a share of the market, but if
you extrapolate it out, it doesn't make sense.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ I think the investment market's already changed. We
just completed our quarter two days ago, and when we announce
earnings we will spend a lot of time on our customer-acquisition
cost and we'll divide that by our number of new customers _ and
unless that number's both low and falling, people will sit there
and say, ``You don't have a model that works.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Returning to the ads, there's been a real saturation
over the last year. Is anyone concerned that consumers may be
overwhelmed by the amount of ads ending with dot-com?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ I think there's a numbness. I know it's happened to
me. Listening to the radio, one company after another: dot-com,
dot-com, and you just start to turn it all off. And it has nothing
to do with the content or the message. It has to do with, Enough!
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ I don't think the consumer says, ``Dot-com, dot-com, I
don't want to listen to it anymore.'' I think they do their own
editing. And then it gets back to where we started, which is, if
you're relevant to them, they will accept you into their lives.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ It's funny, I've been hearing this even before the
Super Bowl _ everybody's sick of the dot-coms. But last night I
turned on ``Law and Order'' and it's ``The Dot-Com Murder,'' you
know? Nobody's really sick of it because it's such an integral part
of our lives. And part of our commercial was saying, ``You know
what? If two guys like us can have a dot-com and an ad on the Super
Bowl, then the dream lives.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ I've heard agency people say that dot-com clients
sometimes treat the advertising like fun and games. And Mike, here
you are, appearing in your own Super Bowl commercial, doing a funny
routine ... as if you're out there having a good time, while the
meter's running at $2 million for 30 seconds. What would you say to
that?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ I'm obviously an egomaniac. But when we sat down
with the agency and they gave us 15 different storyboards, we said
...
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BARON &LR;  _ You said, ``Where's the one with me in it?''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ZAPOLIN &LR;  _ No, we said to ourselves, the only way we can be
unique is to try to give our own story, and to portray that we were
low-tech for novices, to say, ``I don't know more about computers
than you, but I'm just trying to help.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ I want to ask the agency people to evaluate dot-coms
as clients, generally speaking. What do they fail to understand
about advertising and how it works?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ They don't have a huge amount of marketing skills.
Which is wonderful. And it's also terrible. You know, they aren't
ready to look at advertising and marketing as a science. I think
they're more willing to have some fun.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ If they've had business experience before, then
they're usually pretty good. If they just graduated from Stanford
with an MBA six months ago, then some of them have pretty weird
ideas. And so it can be good and bad. I mean, you may come up with
something wild and wacky like shooting gerbils through a hole in
the wall, and these guys say: ``Yeah, let's do it. And we've got to
be on the air next week.'' Whereas if you're dealing with Procter &AMP;
Gamble, you'd have to research it. And you'd never get away with it
to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; GRACE &LR;  _ You'd have to change it to squirrels.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ The other thing is, I have friends in agencies around
the country who are steering clear of dot-com companies because
they have huge debts that these guys don't pay up.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WECAL &LR;  _ But they've also woken up the rest of the clients _
they've provided shock treatment for the advertising industry. You
have clients that are not dot-coms that want a little of that fun;
they want to be talked about. So it's giving us the opportunity to
prove that advertising can be powerful for a brand again.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ This has been noted before, but it's ironic that new
media is spending so much on old media. With dot-coms relying so
heavily on TV commercials, does it suggest that advertising on the
Internet is not a viable way to build a business right now?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ The last couple of years has proven that advertising
on the Internet doesn't work. Even when you get the hits, you get
visitors but nothing else. I mean, right now, as it's structured,
Internet advertising is probably one of the worst ways you can
spend your money.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BOWMAN &LR;  _ I think every new medium launches through the old
media. You rely on the old media because that's the mass market;
that's how you reach everybody. And then you get more targeted and
specific.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ So is this just a temporary bubble now, as far as all
the TV commercials are concerned?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; VERDI &LR;  _ I think it's a bubble. As the numbers come in from the
fourth quarter, I think the expectations for the advertising were
much higher than what the delivery was, and I think that reality is
going to start setting in. That doesn't mean that there isn't an
incredibly important role for advertising. But it is going to find
its place in the mix.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; BERGER &LR;  _ Any thoughts on how dot-com advertising will evolve
from here?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; PARKER &LR;  _ I think it will become respectable as the bigger
companies get into it. They'll want to take less chances, so
they'll focus-group research it and what will happen is what
happens to all advertising that goes through that process. It won't
be as funny. It won't be as edgy.

   HONEY, THERE'S A DOT-COM GROWING IN THE LIVING ROOM
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-ETAIL-PRIMER-NYTSF _ For more than 15 years, Tony Dunne had
informally designed interiors of homes for family and friends. Last
May, he was designing two apartments when he returned home from a
long day spent in furniture showrooms and told his wife about an
idea he had for a business. HauteDecor.com would bring together
about 20 top designers and have each create virtual rooms, in which
everything would be for sale. On July 1, 1999, they received
$500,000 for financing. This is their story. By Rosemary Breslin.
</P>
<P>
   TRACKING THE WEB TO REMOTE WESTERN CHINA
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-CHINA-NYTSF _ Thanks to modem connections and the efforts
of local entrepreneurs, the Internet is trickling into back alleys
and basements of the most remote regions of western China. A
nationwide system of local Internet service providers was completed
last year; now the seven westernmost provinces account for 5
percent of the country's Internet use. By Jennifer 8. Lee.
</P>
<P>
   PEDICARTS LINK SHANGHAI'S STREETS TO THE INTERNET
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-SHANGHAI-NYTSF _ In the United States, ``fulfillment'' of
Internet orders can be left to domestic mail carriers. But in
China, where the dreams of dot-com wealth soar as high as the
obstacles to e-commerce _ like snail mail that deserves the name, a
balkanized banking system and a near-absence of consumer credit
cards _ success calls for a kind of ingenuity not taught at
business school. By Grace Fan.
</P>
<P>
   SPINNING OFF CAN MEAN BIG MONEY, BUT BIG DANGER TOO
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-SPINOFF-RISKS-NYTSF _ As establishing an Internet presence
becomes imperative for brick-and-mortar companies, they face the
urgent question of how much distance, physical and logistical, to
put between themselves and their online operations. By Hillary
Appelman.
</P>
<P>
   HIS PITCH: COME ON IN, THE WATER'S LUCRATIVE
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-CEO-RECRUITING-NYTSF _ Today, the nation's most experienced
managers are trying to decide whether to jump to Internet startups
with little more than a business plan and a pile of
not-yet-valuable stock options. Nobody understands this dilemma
better than David Beirne, a top technology headhunter who is now a
partner in Benchmark Capital, a leading Silicon Valley venture
capital fund. A Q&AMP;A interview. By Saul Hansell.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW ECONOMY'S CURRENCY IS STOCK, STOCK AND STOCK
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-EQUITY-STAKE-NYTSF _ Today, hordes of business-to-business
contractors who make deals with high-tech companies are trading
their services for equity. While law firms have long taken slices
of their clients' companies on top of regular fees, consultants are
now doing the same, along with public-relations agencies, executive
search firms and commercial landlords. Now, signing contracts with
new clients resembles aggressive stock picking. By Martha Baer.
</P>
<P>
   IS ANYONE NOT OUT FOR E-BILLIONS? JOSIE TRUE, FOR ONE
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-NONCOMMERCIAL-SITES _ Without millions of dollars of
investors' money to buy mass-market advertising, noncommercial
sites, especially ones catering to untapped or underserved sectors,
face an uphill battle as they try to gather like-minded audiences
from the far corners of cyberspace. But such efforts are far from a
lost cause. By Andrea Adelson.
</P>
<P>
   HELP! MY BRAIN'S BEING EATEN BY A ZILLION DOT-COM ADS!
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-ADVERTISING-NYTSF _ A gerbil shot from a cannon. An actor
singing off-key. A college student who burps the alphabet. These
were just a few of the colorful images used in the past year by
dot-com companies flooding the airwaves with ``edgy'' advertising.
To analyze why dot-com advertisements are so wild, whether they
work and where they are going, a group of advertisers and dot-com
clients watched one another's commercials and exchanged views.
</P>
<P>
   BEHIND `NAME YOUR OWN PRICE' LIES A MESH OF PARTNERS
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-PRICELINE.COM-NYTSF _ Priceline.com allows a buyer to
propose a price that the seller, whether of airline tickets or
orange juice, can choose to accept or reject. This approach comes
out as the slogan ``Name Your Own Price.'' What Jay S. Walker, its
46-year-old founder, has in mind is more radical than eBay, pushing
a strategy that is becoming more important throughout e-commerce:
partnerships. Included: a sidebar about the author's experience
using Priceline. By Allen R. Myerson.
</P>
<P>
   TO PUT GE ONLINE MEANT PUTTING A DOZEN INDUSTRIES ONLINE
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-GE-ONLINE-NYTSF _ Early last year, John F. Welch, the chief
executive and chairman of General Electric, asked the managers of
the huge company's businesses to establish a strategy for using the
Internet and to put it into effect before the end of 1999. All 12
of the GE's departments, from airplane engines to appliances to
industrial systems, met the goal. Here is what the
multibillion-dollar company learned by adapting to the Web. By
Douglas Frantz.
</P>
<P>
   CHARITIES SEE WEB'S POTENTIAL, BUT FIND IT HARD TO AFFORD
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-NONPROFITS-NYTSF _ Businesses have discovered the power of
the Internet for communicating with employees and customers quickly
through e-mail or a Web site. Nonprofit organizations should find
the Internet just as appealing. But the majority of charitable
organizations have been hindered by a lack of money, time, workers
and technological savvy. By Reed Abelson.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTIONS CREEP INTO ALL KINDS OF SITES (BECAUSE THEY'RE FUN)
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-AUCTIONS-NYTSF _ Ebay isn't the only site running auctions
anymore. Retailers like Sharper Image Co. and Lands' End have
instituted auction components as part of their sites. Why? Once
consumers have gotten the bidding bug, they will go to auctions as
much for the thrill of the chase as to obtain an item. And they
will keep coming back. By Sally McGrane.
</P>
<P>
   BETTER WAYS TO SEARCH THAN TYPING `NEEDLE AND HAYSTACK'
</P>
<P>
   ECOM-WEBSEARCH-TEST-NYTSF _ The modern equivalent of searching
for a needle in a haystack is searching for just about anything on
the Web. To illustrate this, three people were asked to track down
three very different items in a random, completely unscientific
test. Here are the results. By Lisa Napoli.

   Who wants to be a centimillionaire?
</P>
<P>
   That is the question rattling around the most elite country
clubs and the executive washrooms of the biggest corporations, as
the nation's most experienced managers decide whether to jump to
Internet startups with little more than a business plan and a pile
of not-yet-valuable stock options.
</P>
<P>
   The good news, for those who want to take their chances, is that
Silicon Valley needs as many chief executives as Cecil B. DeMille
needed extras. Still, for the open CEO jobs and headless companies,
the mating rituals between start-up and seasoned executive are
complex. No one is likely to know them better than David Beirne, a
top technology headhunter who is now a partner in Benchmark
Capital, a leading Silicon Valley venture capital fund.
</P>
<P>
   For 12 years, Beirne was a partner at Ramsey/Beirne Associates
of Ossining, N.Y., and recruited top names, including Robert J.
Herbold from Procter &AMP; Gamble to be chief operating officer at
Microsoft and James Barksdale from Federal Express to be chief
executive of the young Netscape Communications Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Beirne's switch, in 1997, to Benchmark, notable for its early
investment in eBay, the online auction company, was not as big a
jump as it might have seemed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't do any more recruiting or any less than the other
partners here,'' Beirne said. ``But all of us spend a tremendous
amount of time recruiting for our companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, talent wins.''
</P>
<P>
   Bierne spoke about the challenges of recruiting Internet chief
executives in true Silicon Valley style _ while talking on a cell
phone as he jumped out of a taxi and ran through an airport
security check on his way home from a corporate board meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you look for in a chief executive to run an Internet
company?
</P>
<P>
   A: One size doesn't fit all. Intellect and raw leadership
ability is a given. What you really need is someone who is a magnet
for talent. Since talent is the scarcest resource and getting more
scarce, the key to success is being able to recruit a world-class
team.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is different about recruiting a chief executive for an
Internet company?
</P>
<P>
   A: What's more apparent is the need for speed. Five years ago,
people could take their time making decisions. Today, if someone
doesn't have the ability to adapt to the pace, you have to pass on
them.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How do you tell if a candidate can keep up with Internet
time?
</P>
<P>
   A: You have to spend a tremendous amount of time with them to
get into their heads. You also look at what culture they come from.
It's one thing to say to yourself you can deal with the pace; it's
another thing to have lived it.
</P>
<P>
   It's no accident that so many Internet executives were at FedEx
in the early days, like Barksdale, Christos (M. Cotsakos) of
E-Trade Group, and (William J.) Razzouk, who is now running
PlanetRx.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why would someone quit a cushy, well-paid job at the top of a
big company to join a start-up?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't believe there is such a thing as a person who can't
be recruited. You have to find the right opportunity for someone
and sell them the dream.
</P>
<P>
   A person wants to come in and really have an impact on the
world. Instead of running some division of AT&AMP;T, they want to
create something that has huge shareholder value that changes the
way people do what they do. There is a huge psychic reward to doing
that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did somebody say stock options?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of these guys have made enough money, so it's not about
that anymore. It is about psychic gratification when the day is
done.
</P>
<P>
   There is financial reward _ if it works. There is more financial
upside and higher risk.
</P>
<P>
   Look at Shaun Holliday, who now runs Living.Com (an online
furniture store in which Benchmark has an investment). He was
running Guinness Ireland, and so he was practically running
Ireland. Now he has only $200,000 in cash compensation. But like
all these guys, he can make $100 million or more if it works.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why would you pick someone like George Shaheen, who ran
Andersen Consulting, to be the head of WebVan, an Internet grocery
store?
</P>
<P>
   A: First of all, WebVan isn't just a grocery store, it's the
last mile for the Internet. At the end of the day, it's a systems
company. Hiring a marketing guy from Pepsi wouldn't have been right
for this company. I can get all the marketing people I want to work
under him. Also, Shaheen is a great leader, a magnet for talent,
and people will follow him. And he has built a massive scale
business on a global basis.
</P>
<P>
   Q: So, with all the billions that have been made by Internet
executives, are you besieged by corner-office executives who want
to run Internet companies?
</P>
<P>
   A: It certainly was different when I recruited Barksdale to
Netscape. That was a seminal event: the first time a world-class
executive ever came to run an Internet company. It was a lot more
difficult before people saw the wealth creation.
</P>
<P>
   There is now a huge number of executives who want to leave their
corporate jobs and join the next dot-com. And with success,
executives can see 10 other people with experience they can relate
to. They see they can have a fun quotient. But I don't think it's
getting any easier to find the talent you really need to have. A
lot of companies are settling just to get a body in the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Since you have been a headhunter so long, can you save money
on fees to search firms?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. There hasn't been a time that I haven't hired a search
firm. It's another set of eyes and ears. And even if I know my
first and second choice, you need a process in place behind you if
you can't get them.

LABOR SECRETARY DID NOT BREAK   LAWS, INVESTIGATION CONCLUDES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent prosecutor who has been
investigating accusations of corruption involving Alexis Herman,
the secretary of labor, said Wednesday that he has concluded that
Herman did not break any laws and should not be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, the fifth Cabinet officer in the Clinton administration
to come under the scrutiny of an independent counsel, was accused
by a former business partner of engaging in a plan involving
kickbacks and solicitation of illegal campaign contributions to the
Democratic Party. But the independent counsel, Ralph Lancaster, who
conducted the 23-month investigation, announced in a one-sentence
statement Wednesday that he would not seek an indictment of Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said she was ``gratified personally and for my family''
that the investigation was over. Her lawyer, Neil Eggleston, said
Herman had cooperated ``in every way possible'' with Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   The charges against Herman were made by Laurent Yene, a
Cameroonian businessman living in the United States who said
Herman, while head of the White House office of public liaison,
improperly agreed to accept payments in return for generating
business for a consulting firm owned jointly by Yene and a close
friend of Herman's, Vanessa Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Yene also accused Herman of directing Weaver to pressure the
firm's clients to illegally contribute money to the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Barcella, a lawyer for Weaver and her sister, Caryliss,
said Wednesday that he had been notified that Lancaster had also
decided there were no grounds to prosecute his clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been an ordeal,'' said Barcella, describing his clients
as ``relieved.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that it took a couple of years and $4 million or
$5 million of public money,'' Barcella said. ``This is why the
independent counsel law is well buried.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to clear Herman is a boost not only to her but also
to Vice-President Al Gore, since any indictment against Herman
would have been an embarrassment to his presidential campaign. Some
of the accusations against her involving fund-raising were
connected to the system of raising money through White House
coffees, an issue with which Gore was closely connected.

   The four other Cabinet officers who were investigated were
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who was cleared last October by
an independent counsel of charges that he had lied about his role
in an Interior Department decision to deny an application by three
Indian tribes to operate a casino in Hudson, Wis.; former Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros, who pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor
count of lying to the FBI about payments to a former mistress;
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was acquitted at trial
of corruption allegations; and Ron Brown, the commerce secretary
who was accused of failing to properly report large payments from a
business partner. That investigation ended when Brown was killed in
a plane crash in Croatia in April 1996.
</P>
<P>
   When Attorney General Janet Reno sought the appointment of an
independent counsel to resolve the accusations against Herman, she
emphasized that she had no choice but to do so under the law that
was in existence at the time. The law lapsed last June.

COMPUTER QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)

<P>
   Q. I have so many programs on my computer that I can't see the
whole list in the Windows 98 Start menu. Is there any way to
rearrange the list so I can get my most-used programs together in
one place?
</P>
<P>
   A. Windows 98 very helpfully adds most newly installed software
applications to the Programs list, but the list can get rather
lengthy if you have a large number of them. New programs are added
to the list in alphabetical order by default, with folders coming
before single items.
</P>
<P>
   You can rearrange the programs so that you can find them more
quickly on the list. In the Start menu, click on the program folder
or item that you would like to move, then drag it to where you want
it to be.
</P>
<P>
   If you use just a few applications repeatedly, the easiest place
to put them is in the center of the Programs list. You may also
want to consider making desktop shortcuts for them or loading them
into your Startup items area so they are ready to go when you boot
your computer.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative to rearranging the list: If you are
trying to get to a specific program, like Microsoft Word, you can
quickly jump to that area of the list by typing the first letter of
the folder or item. Clicking on Start and then typing M, for
example, will send you right into the part of the list where the
programs starting with M reside.
</P>
<P>
   If you find that your Programs menu is cluttered with
applications that you rarely use, you can remove them from the list
without removing the actual program from your hard disk. In the
Start menu, go to Settings and select Taskbar. In the box, click on
the Start Menu Programs tab and then on Remove. In the list that
appears, click on the programs you want to remove from the menu and
click on Remove again.
</P>
<P>
   If you would like to rename a program in the list (doing so will
not affect the actual program on your computer), go to the same
Start Menu Programs box and click on Advanced. In the Contents of
Start Menu area of the Windows Explorer window, find the program
you want to rename. Right-click on the program name, select Rename,
type in the new name and hit the Enter key.
</P>
<P>
   Mac users who find unwanted program alias files in the Apple
Menu can go to the Apple Menu Items folder inside the System folder
on the hard drive and drag unwanted aliases to the trash. Users can
also change the names of the Apple menu's alias files by retyping
them _ just make sure they are alias files and not the original
program icons.
</P>
<P>
   Q. I'm having printing problems in Windows 98 and was told that
I should make sure I have the right printer driver on my computer.
I don't see the name of my printer in the list, so how can I find
the right driver?
</P>
<P>
   A. Having the correct printer driver for your PC or Mac is vital
to trouble-free printing because the driver tells the computer
exactly what kind of printer you have and what it can do. Without
the right driver, you may be experiencing quirky output from your
printer or may not be able to print at all.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best place to find missing printer drivers is on the
floppy disks or CD-ROM that came with the printer. Check the
printer manual for instructions on where to find the driver and how
to install it. If you no longer have the disk or the manual, you
can often find a library of printer drivers available for download
on the Web site of the company that made your printer. If you don't
have Web access, call the company's technical support number and
ask about how to obtain the software.
</P>
<P>
   If you are new to the world of device drivers and have a
connection to the Web, you may want to check out the Driver Guide
at www.driverguide.com. The site asks each new user to register,
but it is free and offers a wealth of information about device
drivers, including those for printers. You can find links to major
manufacturers of printers and other hardware, as well as tutorials
on how to install and update your drivers.

&HT;     HOW BUSH AND GORE SHOULD CHOOSE A RUNNING MATE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, April 9)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 &HT;     By ROBERT E. THOMPSON  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore and George W. Bush have roughly four months
to ponder the first fateful decision that a presidential nominee
must make _ the selection of a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   The decision always is a gamble. The vice president, occupying
the post that John Adams described as ``the most insignificant
office that ever the invention of man contrived,'' may at any
moment succeed to one of the most significant offices ever devised
_ commander-in-chief of the world's richest and most powerful
nation.
</P>
<P>
   Some vice presidents have been nonentities, chosen simply to
provide a party's ticket with geographic, age or philosophical
balance. Others, such as Hubert Humphrey and Nelson Rockefeller,
have been men of stature who would have made excellent presidents.
</P>
<P>
   In the past century, four vice presidents _ Theodore Roosevelt,
Calvin Coolidge, Harry Truman and Lyndon Johnson _ have succeeded
to the presidency on the death of the incumbent and one _ Gerald
Ford _ on the resignation of the incumbent.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president can emerge as a highly influential force
within the president's White House team or fade into the
background. It all depends on the veep's own leadership qualities
and relationship with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The Constitution provides only limited duty for the vice
president _ to preside over the Senate, cast the deciding tally
when there is a tie vote and take over the presidency when the
incumbent dies, resigns or is declared unable to fulfill his
duties.
</P>
<P>
   The vice presidency has played a significant role in the
political fortunes of both Gore and Bush, and how they approach and
resolve the matter of a running mate could provide an insight into
how they would conduct themselves in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who in 1988 ran an unsuccessful campaign for the
Democratic presidential nomination, was chosen as Bill Clinton's
running mate in 1992 and since then has become the president's
highly valued partner in both national and international matters.
</P>
<P>
   In designating Gore for that office, Clinton chose a moderate
Democrat from Arkansas' neighboring state of Tennessee who is two
years his junior and shares his aspirations for America. Clinton
thus abandoned the philosophical, generational and geographic
criteria that normally play a role in the nomination of a vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Gore unquestionably is the most influential vice
president in history.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, his father's elevation to vice president by Ronald
Reagan in the 1980 election followed by the senior Bush's own
presidency from 1989 to 1993 provided the name identification,
money connections and political ties that helped propel George W.
toward the nation's highest office.
</P>
<P>
   A far less successful choice was President Bush's designation in
1988 of Dan Quayle as his running mate. Quayle, a second-term
senator, was virtually unknown outside his home state of Indiana
and had little influence in the Senate. He was viewed by many
Americans as something of a sad joke.
</P>
<P>
   But the senior Bush was 64 at the time he was nominated and,
emulating Dwight Eisenhower's selection of Richard Nixon, who was
23 years Ike's junior, he chose Quayle who was 40 years old and the
grandson of Indiana's most prominent newspaper publisher, the late
Eugene Pulliam.
</P>
<P>
   Like his son 12 years later, President Bush was under strong
pressure to name an abortion foe. He started with a lengthy list of
possible vice presidents, headed by Bob Dole, his wife Elizabeth
Dole, former Rep. Jack Kemp and at least 12 others including John
McCain, a Vietnam War hero who was a U.S. senator from Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   In a memo from one GOP campaign adviser to another, Roger Ailes
wrote that Quayle ``looks like Robert Redford, only he is better
looking. He symbolizes youth in the future of the Republican
Party.''
</P>
<P>
   So George Herbert Walker Bush named Quayle, who was identified
with the GOP's right wing. If Americans remember nothing else from
the 1988 campaign, they recall the televised debate between Quayle
and the Democratic vice presidential nominee, then-Texas Sen. Lloyd
Bentsen.
</P>
<P>
   During that confrontation Quayle proudly claimed to have had as
much experience in government as John F. Kennedy did when he sought
he presidency in 1960. The words were barely out of his mouth when
Bentsen caustically declared, ``Senator, I served with Jack
Kennedy. I knew Jack Kennedy. Jack Kennedy was a friend of mine.
Senator, you are no Jack Kennedy.''
</P>
<P>
   Quayle's feeble response was that Bentsen's remark was ``really
uncalled for.''
</P>
<P>
   The younger Bush is not expected to make a similar mistake this
year. When asked whether his running mate would have to pass an
anti-abortion litmus test, George W. has replied that the only
qualification he would look for in a running mate would be his or
her ability to serve as president.
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s most popular choice of a running mate would be
McCain, but the Arizona senator has vowed that he will not run for
that office.
</P>
<P>
   Three talented governors could also enhance the GOP ticket and
presumably serve well in the White House _ New Jersey's Christine
Todd Whitman, Pennsylvania's Tom Ridge and New York's George
Pataki. Ohio Rep. John Kasich, an expert in budgetary matters, and
Nebraska Senator Chuck Hagel could prove attractive and qualified
candidates. Elizabeth Dole also is available.
</P>
<P>
   Gore could choose former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley who
opposed him in the primaries or one of several senators _
California's Dianne Feinstein, Massachusetts' John Kerry, Florida's
Bob Graham, Indiana's Evan Bayh and Nebraska's Bob Kerrey, who is
retiring from the Senate. A long shot, but a good one, would be
California Gov. Gray Davis.
</P>
<P>
   The day that either party would choose a vice presidential
nominee who lacks strong qualifications for the presidency should
be over. We no longer can afford a vice president who is a joke.

FILTERING THE DOCTOR-PATIENT RELATIONSHIP THROUGH A TRANSLATOR 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif.)   By EDWARD WONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, Dr. William Bateman looked for a way to break down
the language barriers that hampered patient care at the Manhattan
hospital where he worked as medical director. It was no easy task:
the hospital, Gouverneur, was located on the Lower East Side of
Manhattan, a neighborhood mostly made up of Hispanic and Chinese
immigrants. Half the patients could not speak English fluently.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors have been using hospital volunteers or nurses when they
needed interpreters, but that practice has its shortcomings. Those
people often have no training in medical interpretation. Sometimes
the patient interacts more with the interpreter than with the
doctor. At other times, the patient is reluctant to talk honestly
to the doctor with a third person in the room.
</P>
<P>
   Then five years ago, a colleague told Bateman about medical
interpretation technology that was being developed in California.
The concept seemed simple enough: Equip doctors and patients with
wireless headsets, and hook those up to a bank of staff people
trained in simultaneous interpretation, as is done at the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Last April, Gouverneur became one of two medical centers in the
country to introduce the technology as an alternative to on-site
interpreters. Medical staff members and patients in the adult
medicine and mental health departments now have the option of
speaking with one another by using headsets that connect with
simultaneous interpreters, five floors above them, who speak
Spanish, Cantonese and Mandarin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective communication is the fuel that drives medical
service,'' said Bateman, now the director of business development
at the hospital. ``Communication to us is like the Standard Oil of
the industrial age.''
</P>
<P>
   Using a system designed by a company called Simulmed, the doctor
and the patient both wear headsets connected to a small black
transmitter box that can be looped around the neck or onto a belt.
The speech is transmitted wirelessly to a nearby receiver and then
sent digitally over a fiber-optic line to a central switching
station in the interpreter room.
</P>
<P>
   There, people wearing headsets translate the speech, which is
then transmitted back to the doctor and the patient. By using a
toggle switch, the translator ensures that the doctor and the
patient hear only their own languages.
</P>
<P>
   Each interpreter speaks each word almost as soon as it is heard
through the headset.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, the wireless transmission technology is the same as
that used by theater producers and football coaches. But William
Wood, founder of Simulmed, based in Foster City, Calif., said that
within the next year the technology would start using
nonproprietary Ethernet transmission, a cheaper and more flexible
method that lets new users, even at locations outside the hospital,
join the system more easily. The only difference that speakers will
notice is that they will wear headsets that communicate to cell
phones on their belts in place of the radio transmitter boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Using simultaneous interpretation in a one-on-one medical
setting was the brainchild of Dr. Count Gibson, a professor
emeritus at the Stanford University School of Medicine. As a young
lieutenant in the United States Army medical corps, Gibson spent
several hours at the Nuremberg trials after World War II. He picked
up a headset and listened as the testimonies of Nazi war criminals
were interpreted simultaneously into five languages.
</P>
<P>
   When the trials ended, the interpreters moved to New York to
work for the United Nations, and Gibson carried with him the germ
of an idea that would see fruition in the mid-1980s. That was when
he met Wood, who was running a company that provided simultaneous
interpretation at business conferences. Gibson's interest in
interpretation had been reawakened by his years at Stanford, where
he saw a large number of patients who spoke only Spanish or
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   The first headsets that Gibson and Wood developed had wires
connecting them to remote interpreters. With a Kaiser Family
Foundation grant, they upgraded to wireless transmission and
introduced the technology in a pilot program in the Santa Clara
County Valley Medical Center, where many patients speak only
Spanish. A second study was completed in 1996, and the center is
installing the technology for use in its physical therapy
department.
</P>
<P>
   Alberto Garcia, the center's language services coordinator, said
the new system saved time because the interpreters did not have to
show up in person. It also allows doctors and patients to maintain
more eye contact. ``This will also help us in the physical therapy
areas, where a lot of noise and conversations are taking place in
the gym,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bateman has added a twist to the system at Gouverneur in that
all the interpreters are visually impaired or blind. A state agency
that finds employment for people with such handicaps has paid for
training costs and monitors that magnify words on a computer
screen. The interpreters are trained and monitored by experts who
speak Spanish and Chinese dialects.
</P>
<P>
   But the remote interpretation system has its critics. What some
see as advantages _ the removal of a third person's presence, the
word-for-word interpretation _ others see as potential pitfalls.
Linda Haffner, director of interpreter services at Stanford
University Hospital and Clinics, said face-to-face interpretation
was necessary in certain situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the clues I get from the patient is when I am talking
to them in person,'' she said. ``You have to take into
interpretation the visual cues from a person.''
</P>
<P>
   Haffner said that simultaneous interpretation did not allow room
for the interpreter to stop and explain things in more depth to the
speakers.
</P>
<P>
   But several doctors who have used the system at Gouverneur said
they were pleased. Bateman said he would like to hire more
interpreters, especially a Fujianese speaker, and to distribute
headset units on more wards. But price remains a barrier: each
headset and transmitter costs $2,000, while the central switching
unit costs $10,000 and interpreter stations run $3,000 each. Wood
said the change to Ethernet technology would cut down on those
costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``To tell you the truth, I wasn't sure how I would feel about
it,'' said Wendy Barron, a clinical psychologist at Gouverneur.
``But since we've been using it, I've been more and more pleased.
The interpreters have been really professional, and it's made a
huge difference for us.'' (af)

   Bringing Up Daisy
</P>
<P>
   Q. Late last spring I purchased two small pots of Cape daisy.
The label said only osteospermum. Over the summer, they became so
huge I had to build cages around them. I cut them back late in the
season, and when the first frost turned the foliage to slime, I cut
them back again. Was this a mistake? Should I have mulched them for
winter? The greengrocer I bought them from knew only that ``it will
come back again next year,'' so I assume osteospermum is a
perennial. I would appreciate any tips on growing them.
</P>
<P>
   A. Most Osteospermums are indeed perennial, but only in their
native South Africa and in similarly frost-free climates.
Everywhere else, they are treated as annuals.
</P>
<P>
   Osteospermums, sometimes labeled Dimorphotheca, or Star of the
Veldt, come in a wide range of colors from bright oranges and rich
purple-reds to yellow, pink and cream. Though a few are
golden-centered, most have dark hearts, and this is especially
striking in the lavender-tinged whites.
</P>
<P>
   Cape daisies are sun lovers that close at night and on dark
cloudy days. They don't mind heat, and, once established, will
tolerate some drought. Seeds need warm soil to germinate but grow
so easily and quickly they can be sown the garden in spring for
summer bloom about nine weeks later. They'll flower all season
long, if you keep them deadheaded; and should the plants start
looking used up, you can cut them back to strong buds and they will
put out vigorous new flowering shoots.
</P>
<P>
   Seeds and plants of several varieties are widely available in
garden centers. The Internet site www.osteospermum.com, an upbeat
fan page originated by commercial breeders, offers photographs,
links galore and some mail-order sources.
</P>
<P>
   A Useful Time-Out
</P>
<P>
   Q. The recent birth of our third child in three and a half years
has led, after some discussion, to a gardening moratorium for this
season. Could you suggest some sort of cover crop that would leave
my four four-by-six-foot raised beds in excellent shape for next
year's garden? I can set up a drip irrigation system, but can't
devote much other time to it.
</P>
<P>
   A. Planting a cover crop isn't a moratorium: it's an advance.
When you give your beds a season filled with crops like buckwheat,
clover and alfalfa, you're using a very low tech (and low cost) but
highly effective natural system to give them a major boost. Legumes
like alfalfa, which can gather nitrogen from the air, are best for
increasing fertility. But all cover crops will improve soil
structure, prevent erosion and forestall the invasion of weeds.
</P>
<P>
   As a bonus, many of these crops are as beautiful as they are
useful. Choose crimson clover and you will have carpets of rich red
flowers. With alfalfa you get endless subtle shadings of blue-green
that shift with every wind. Grasses offer deep greens that turn to
gold at season's end.
</P>
<P>
   The hardest decision will probably be between hardy plants and
those that die over the winter. Buckwheat, for example, will be
knocked down by frost and rot to almost nothing by spring. Winter
rye, on the other hand, will persist long into the fall and sprout
again early in the season. Tender plants mean less work next year
when it's time to till them into the soil, but perennials tend to
give you more soil building power and look better, longer, while
they do it.
</P>
<P>
   One warning: Many cover crops flower heavily, attracting large
numbers of assorted bees. Most bees are not aggressive, but if
you're planning to turn the toddlers loose nearby, it might be wise
to stick to grasses, which are of no interest to stinging insects.
</P>
<P>
   There is a wide selection of cover crops, all of them thoroughly
described, offered by Fedco Seeds, P.O. Box 520, Waterville, Maine
04905, (207) 873-7333; catalog is $2. Another good source is
Peaceful Valley Farm Supply. P.O. Box 2209, Grass Valley, Calif.

HISPANICS ARE NARROWING THE DIGITAL DIVIDE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Texas)   By KATIE HAFNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the attention paid to the so-called digital divide
lately, little of it has been devoted to the topic of Hispanics in
the United States and their computer and Internet usage.
</P>
<P>
   A 150-page report released Thursday by Cheskin Research, a
market research firm in Redwood Shores, Calif., found that for
Hispanics, that gap is narrowing, and that the rate at which
Hispanics in this country are buying computers far outstrips that
of the general population.
</P>
<P>
   The Cheskin study, titled ``The Digital World of the U.S.
Hispanic,'' was based on a telephone survey of 2,017 Hispanic
households in February. The survey found that 42 percent of the
nation's 9.3 million Hispanic households had a computer. That
represents a 68 percent increase over 1998, compared with a 43
percent increase in computer ownership for the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Economics still plays a large role. The median income for
Hispanic households is $28,300, compared with $38,900 for the
general population, said Felipe Korzenny, a principal at Cheskin
Research and the main author of the study.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Cheskin study, 25 percent of Hispanic
households with annual incomes between $10,000 and $20,000 have a
computer. Another recent study of the gap between the computer
haves and have-nots, conducted by National Public Radio, the Kaiser
Family Foundation and Harvard University's Kennedy School of
Government, showed that in the general population where household
income is less than $20,000, 31 percent of households had computers
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that gap in income, the degree to which the
Hispanics are adopting the technology is beyond expectations,''
Korzenny said.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason for the large increase in computer purchases
among Hispanics, Korzenny said, is ``a very strong motivation of
not being left behind.''
</P>
<P>
   Korzenny said that although the perception of high cost is still
a strong barrier to computer ownership, lack of information about
technology is an impediment that looms just as large.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kids get it,'' said Rochelle Newman, president of Enlace
Communications, an advertising firm in Los Angeles that focuses on
the Hispanic market. ``They see that it will get them to the next
level. The kids are the ambassadors for the technology
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Newman said that in all the years she has been marketing to
Hispanics, she has not see anything as strong as the Hispanic
consumer's interest in being online. In focus groups she has
conducted on the topic of health care, she said, ``the respondents
still don't know what an HMO is, but they do know the Internet
could help them find out what an HMO is.''
</P>
<P>
   Another problem in the past, Korzenny said, has been the dearth
of Hispanic-oriented Web sites. But now, sites like quepasa.com,
Latino.com and Yupi, to name a few, are beginning to appear on the
Web.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been interesting watching it develop from a very small
group of Hispanic-oriented sites to all the new sites like
quepasa.com and Espanol.com,'' said Ernest Bromley, president of
Bromley Communications, an advertising firm in San Antonio that
focuses on the Hispanic market. ``Plus there are all the companies
coming in from Latin America launching their portals. It's just
going crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   Surprisingly, however, Korzenny said, most Hispanic Internet
users prefer the Spanish-language versions of Yahoo and America
Online to the Hispanic-specific sites.
</P>
<P>
   One possible explanation, Korzenny said, is that the Hispanic
sites do not do enough to distinguish themselves from the AOL's of
the world. ``These sites, though they're very nice, look like
replicas of Yahoo, AOL and Netscape Navigator,'' he said. ``The
point of differentiation might not be strong enough. My guess is
that the Spanish sites have focused on being sophisticated portals
without customizing themselves to the culture or the needs of the
culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the greater popularity of the mainstream
portals' Hispanic versions, the situation could soon change,
because Quepasa.com recently began offering free, ad-supported
Internet access through NetZero.
</P>
<P>
   Newman said the next big challenge is to get computers into more
Hispanic households. ``There is still the economic ``she said.
</P>
<P>
   Korzenny said that one way he sees to increase computer
ownership among Hispanics is with innovative sales methods. He
pointed to retailers like La Curacao, in Southern California, that
have succeeded by going door to door, offering credit to low-income
Hispanics with no credit history.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are people with relatively low income but they would
pay,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell computer executives that if they would partner with
these companies and sell computers that way,'' he added, ``they
could sell hundreds per day.''

&HT;     EXPERTS SAY MAYOR EITHER HAD HELP, OR LUCK, WITH PORTFOLIO 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LANCE WILLIAMS and CHUCK FINNIE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Mayor Willie Brown says he made a quick
financial killing as an Internet stock trader, but traders say they
have trouble believing that he really chose his stocks in the way
he described.
</P>
<P>
   Financial specialists said that only an unbelievable run of good
luck _ or some major help from the inside _ could explain how Brown
obtained the initial stock offerings of eight red-hot companies
during a nine-week stretch that coincided with his 1999 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's 16-stock portfolio, heavy on technology companies
selling shares for the first time, has doubled in value since it
was assembled between Oct. 1 and Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   In one case, according to financial disclosure statements, Brown
flipped an Internet stock called Expedia Inc. two days after it
went public, obtaining a 280 percent return on his investment.
</P>
<P>
   The financial specialists said it would be very unusual for an
e-trader to have scored so many hot initial offerings, or IPOs, in
so short a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not accusing him of anything, but just hypothetically I
would say this is very questionable unless he is a very lucky
guy,'' said Tom Taulli, the author of the 1999 book ``Investing in
IPOs: New Paths to Profit with Initial Public Offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   Matt Harris, a Santa-Ana based financier, called Brown's run
``extremely rare and odd.'' Even the most skilled e-trader is
unlikely to get a piece of even three successful IPOs in a year's
time, he said. To get in on eight in nine weeks, ``either he was
very lucky, or he knew someone,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Kandace Bender, the mayor's press secretary, said that Brown did
indeed put together the portfolio by buying stocks on a home
computer before going to work.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was doing it at his house at 6 o'clock in the morning,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   In his financial disclosure report, Brown estimated the worth of
his stocks as between $97,000 and $970,000. She said the real value
of Brown's holdings are closer to the lower number.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went on record saying that as of today he was $16,000 in
the hole'' because of Tuesday's market downturn, the spokeswoman
said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Brown's description of how he obtained the
shares did not square with how initial stock offerings are actually
distributed via the Internet. Taulli said that when a company goes
public, its officers and its stock underwriters distribute IPO
stock to valued workers and customers, to wealthy potential clients
_ and to anyone else with whom they want to curry favor.
</P>
<P>
   The insiders who are offered IPOs get the chance to buy a few
hundred shares of the stock at its opening price. In many cases,
that turns out to be no big deal, because IPOs are often clunkers,
Taulli said. But on certain hot IPO issues, stock prices can
double, triple or even quintuple within hours of the market's
opening.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary investors do not get a shot at good initial offerings,
Taulli said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, on-line brokerages have begun distributing a limited
amount of IPO stock to their clients via lotteries. The lottery
makes it difficult for an e-trader to obtain a piece of more than a
handful of good IPOs in a year.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's success rate _ his stocks have shown gains of between 39
percent and 350 percent since he bought them _ is more consistent
with obtaining IPOs the old way, through personal association with
underwriters or company executives, the author said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris called Brown's success unbelievable for an e-trader. ``I
would say that I get one in every 20 IPOs that I try to get (via
the Internet), and that's doing very good,'' he said. ``Lately,
it's been worse. I haven't gotten in on a good IPO since May, and I
apply for all of them,'' including, he added, some of the stocks
the mayor said he obtained on line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be extremely rare and odd for anybody in a two-month
period to get that many IPOs allocated,'' Harris said.
</P>

<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to his disclosure statement, the mayor's stock-buying
binge began Oct. 1 with a purchase of more than $1,000 worth of
McAfee.com Corp. shares at a pre-IPO price of $12 a share. On the
first day of public trading, stock in the Santa Clara-based company
traded up to $44.
</P>
<P>
   After that, Brown bought other plum IPOs: Veritas Software of
Mountain View, the world's largest maker of data storage software;
Texas-based Metasolv Software Inc.; NDS Group PLC, a British
telecom stock; United Parcel Service Inc.; Agilent Technologies and
Cache Flow Inc., two Silicon Valley companies; and Pittsburgh-based
FreeMarkets Inc., an Internet auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Paskin, the wife of former Mayor Frank Jordan and a
manager at Montgomery Securities in San Francisco, said she
eschewed IPOs and other investments during her husband's years in
office to avoid any appearance of favoritism.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never want even the insinuation of us getting in on an
IPO because of Frank's position,'' Paskin said.
</P>
<P>
   While Jordan served as mayor from 1991 to 1995, when Brown
ousted him, Paskin worked in the securities divisions of Wells
Fargo Bank and then Montgomery Securities. At Montgomery, she
added, access to IPOs of substantive value that were underwritten
by the company ``went to our customers who were worth
seven-figures.''

   AIDS-DRUG (Paris) _ The 23 million Africans infected with the
AIDS virus should be given regular doses of a common and affordable
antibiotic, the World Health Organization and UNAids said
Wednesday, as a way to ward off fatal secondary infections. They
based their recommendation on encouraging preliminary studies, and
added that if the results are borne out, the impact could be
dramatic. Many people could add years to their lives and have
longer gaps between debilitating complications. But the antibiotic
is not a cure for the fatal disease. The drug, known as
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or as cotrimoxazole, is marketed as a
generic drug in the U.S. called Bactrim. It can cost as little as
$8 a year in Africa. Its use for prophylaxis there was endorsed for
the first time last week by AIDS experts who convened in Zimbabwe
to assess the new studies. The Clinton administration is spending
more than $100 million to fight AIDS in Africa and trying to raise
that to $325 million. It may spend millions of those dollars to
help distribute Bactrim in Africa, but has not yet calculated how
much to commit. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.

   ABORTION-CONGRESS (Washington) _ In what has become a regular

House Wednesday again debated and approved a measure to ban
``partial birth abortions,'' a bill President Clinton vowed to
veto. Since 1995 the House and the Senate have repeatedly voted to
ban this specific type of abortion, which critics compare to
infanticide. Clinton has vetoed it, and has said he would continue
doing so until it allows an exemption to protect a woman's health.

   MARKET-TRADERS (New York) _ At high noon Tuesday, after a rocky
morning of trading, U.S. stocks pitched into a 90-minute freefall.
By the time the dive ended, shares in some of the market's biggest
and most important companies, from technology leaders like Yahoo to
corporate titans like General Electric, had fallen 5, 10 or even 15
percent. There was no news bulletin to explain the decline, no mad
rumor of presidential ill health war in Asia, only a tidal wave of
selling. Then, just as quickly, the market turned, and many stocks
finished the day close to where they began or even up slightly. So

 By JULIE V. IOVINE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week in Charleston, S.C., a profusion of soft-scented,
full-bloom dogwood, azalea, wisteria, Lady Banksia roses and
peppermint peach trees attested to a city populated by green
thumbs. The perfectly groomed streets of the city, pincered between
two rivers and bursting with august old piles, also bore witness to
a proud attachment to a resplendent past.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest houses date back to the early 1700s; then, the
Georgian period takes over, elegant precision with leaded glass
demilune windows and classical orders. Not to be overlooked are
those magnificent plantation-era dowagers (and tourist magnets),
the single houses with their double verandas facing south over
luscious gardens. The entire historic city is a registered National
Historic Landmark, birthplace of the preservation movement. Even
parking lots rate a mention in the guidebooks.
</P>
<P>
   Down a little alley near the district's epicenter, where even
1980s-era houses have 18th-century-style carriage doors, the most
astonishing sight is not another period gem but something more
unexpected: a modern house. Originally a 1781 brick warehouse, it
has been transformed over time into an ersatz single house.
</P>
<P>
   Today, stripped of ad hoc appendages, the building has returned
to the feeling of being a solid rectangle. The original clay-dark
red-brick walls now feature a series of disciplined steel-case
glass doors that allow an uninterrupted flow between an open
interior and a new bluestone terrace. A stucco addition in the back
is pointedly new. Its glass-and-steel awning mark the official
entrance. A black-bottomed pool reflecting a gnarled peppermint
peach tree and a tinkling rill that flows around the patio's edge
lend the place a meditative mood, offering no scars of the
ferocious battles that were waged over five years to finish the
renovation.
</P>
<P>
   Subtly different and elegantly precise, the modern house in old
Charleston could be the proud standard for a more enlightened
approach to preservation today, beyond just stopping time in its
own tracks.
</P>
<P>
   The owners of the 3,500-square-foot house are James L. and Sarah
Coker, both ``thoroughly South Carolinian for as many generations
as we know of,'' Coker said. She grew up just a few historic alleys
away and hasn't lost a drop of her drawl despite the couple's 1991
move to Stonington, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   Coker, 59, is retired, a director of the Sonoco Products Co.,
founded by his great-grandfather together with a Union soldier
while both were convalescing from wounds received, Coker said, ``in
the war.'' (The company, with sales of about $3 billion, started
with the invention of cardboard spinning cones and now produces
packaging materials, from construction columns to Pringles tubes.
Coker worked on L'eggs pantyhose holder.)
</P>
<P>
   The couple's original plan had been to spruce up the place,
vacant for a year, with a little paint to make it a pied-a-terre
for frequent visits to their hometown. They needed three bedrooms
to handle visits from their far-flung adult children.
</P>
<P>
   They hired W.G. Clark, of Clark and Menefee, a Modernist who had
trained with Robert Venturi and had come to Charleston from
Philadelphia in 1974 because, he said, ``nobody else was going
south'' and he had hoped to corner the market on modern
architecture. His compass must have been broken that day. Most
aspiring architects go west. After all, the city motto is, ``She
guards her buildings, customs and laws.'' When his first job, an
addition to a historic house, was presented to the review board,
the client's mother, a tour guide, opposed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was unprepared for how conservative it was,'' Clark said,
adding, ``That was my first insight into the true nature of
Charleston.''
</P>
<P>
   Well before Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis led candle-lighted vigils
to save Grand Central Station, society ladies in Charleston were
body-blocking bulldozers to halt the demolition of cherished
buildings. In 1920, the Society for the Preservation of Old
Dwellings was established and in 1931, the Board of Architectural
Review was formed to approve permits affecting historic properties.
Numerous watchdog groups monitor preservation and hold views on
change that run the gamut from seeing it as an opportunity to
enhance to a necessary evil to a sacrilege.
</P>
<P>
   But Clark was not particularly flexible himself. Brandishing
principles honed through the close study and admiration of the
works of Louis Kahn and Carlo Scarpa, Clark likes to say: ``We are
modern architects. We abhor anything else.''
</P>
<P>
   During his 15 years in Charleston, few jobs came along; no
surprise. In 1988, he moved to Charlottesville to become chairman
of the architecture department at the University of Virginia.
Clark's partnership with Charles Menefee, formed in 1985, was
dissolved amicably in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was a project in Charleston that established the
architects as inheritors of the mantle of the great Kahn with the
Middleton Inn, a compound of buildings completed in 1985. Its
picturesque siting overlooking the Ashley River and its smooth
concrete cubic forms, wooden shutter walls and window grids made
subtlety sensual and showed that the reductive nature of modernism
could still be packed with emotional power.
</P>
<P>
   Clark takes an almost spiritual approach to building. In an
essay from a forthcoming book on the firm's work, he writes that
architecture should ``seek not only the minimal ruin of the
landscape'' but should also supply ``a replacement of what was lost
with something that atones for the loss.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cokers are equally sensitive to architecture. Both are
members of the advisory council for the National Trust for Historic
Preservation and Coker is on the properties committee at Lyndhurst,
the historic house on the Hudson River. But they are also skeptics
when it comes to what Coker calls ``the whole `Gone With the Wind'
mystique that the tours are selling.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cokers wanted their home to fit in without capitulating to
what they described as a local obsession with making the city more
18th century than it was in the 18th century. Not that they
necessarily shared Clark's Modernist zeal. ``James and I did an
awful lot of stretching,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   The architect proposed stripping off all the various additions
to return the warehouse to its essential shoe-box shape. Gradually
laying bare the structure, Clark discovered that the ground-floor
windows had originally been tall doors and that the roof had had a
much steeper rake, which was restored. Every move was toward
clarity and reduction. The couple had to fight to keep an attached
garage.
</P>
<P>
   The ground floor of the old building became a open living and
dining room with three eight-foot doors leading to the terrace.
Materials were kept to a minimum, primarily concrete, steel and
mahogany (in tribute to the traditional furniture of Charleston).
The architect made much of the division between brick house and
concrete addition.
</P>
<P>
   On the interior, the passage from old to new is marked by a wide
mahogany staircase, flanked by a sandblasted glass scrim with a
vaguely Japanese feeling that rises through the two-story house.
The addition's commandingly modern kitchen has shiny steel
appliances, a concrete counter and mahogany cabinetry to provide
the mollifying effects of richly burnished woodwork.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors enter into the kitchen. Charleston friends find it
disconcerting. ``They get confused,'' Mrs Coker said, ``and say,
`How can a proper front door lead into a kitchen?'''
</P>
<P>
   But it is the upstairs that suggests the most radical break with
tradition. Unable to fit three bedrooms, enough closets and extra
bathrooms onto the second floor, the Cokers decided at their
architect's urging to give it all over to their bedroom. Visiting
children were relegated to a condo around the corner that the
couple bought. ``It became so clear that that was what the house
wanted,'' Coker said. ``It was a real awakening.'' Thus a 13-room
project became a 4-room house.

UNDATED: 4-room house.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The entire project took a languid five years and cost about $2
million dollars. Every decision was made in concert, not only with
Clark but also with the interior designer, Dian Boone of
Philadelphia, and the landscape architect, Warren Byrd of
Charlottesville. ``We would thrash and thrash and thrash until
everyone agreed,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   Well, not everyone. The neighbors, upon learning about the plans
to reinvent the house that they adored as quaint and quirky,
reacted in swift retaliation. At a meeting of the Board of
Architectural Review, a swat team of 50 people filled the gallery.
They complained about the steel and glass; they objected to a plan
to raise a wall separating the garden from the street. The new
addition, they feared, would be visible from the alley. Perhaps
worst of all, a tall plate-glass window on the north facade showed
it didn't have ``northern manners.'' (In Charleston, windows on
north facades are traditionally eliminated to give privacy to
homeowners with south-facing gardens.)
</P>
<P>
   The project was stalled for one and a half years. Some
concessions were made on both sides. The glass stayed, but the wall
was somewhat lowered. A neighboring couple moved out, dreading the
impact of a glass tower on the alley's character.
</P>
<P>
   ``It knocked the wind right out of our sails,'' Coker recalled.
</P>
<P>
   But the Board of Architectural Review took an enlightened
approach and finally granted the building permits. Charles Chase,
the city architect and preservation officer at the time, said
recently, ``We believed that it was one of the very rare moments
when design was able to find the essence of what was appropriate
and interpret it in modern materials with a quiet elegance that is
very fitting for a historic district.''
</P>
<P>
   While sensitive to the neighbors' fears, the delay matured the
Cokers' resolve, and they began to think of the project as a work
of art. ``People conjecture that modern architecture is going to be
cold,'' Coker said. ``They like to surround themselves with lots of
things and fabric and bric-a-brac in order to feel a certain
coziness and they feel threatened that that's going to be taken
away.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple experienced that themselves, at first planning to
fill the house with family heirlooms and then letting them go (but
not far, to the visitors' condo ). ``It was a major accomplishment
to realize I didn't have to live with all this stuff in order to be
comfortable,'' Coker said.
</P>
<P>
   The house was completed last fall. Even the peppermint peach
tree hobbled by Hurricane Hugo came back to life this spring,
bursting with blooms that fill the large window where the Cokers
have their morning coffee. A few neighbors are still griping that
the glass awning is tacky, but Barbara G.S. Hagerty, who lives
across the street, has grown to love the house. ``It's a Zen
space,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The most promising sign that the modern house might be accepted?
The Historic Charleston Foundation just asked if it could put it on
its house tour.

BURSTING BUBBLES: WEB TALES OF SPECULATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
 By MICHAEL POLLAK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For some, the bubble was the great uranium land rush of the
1950s. When it burst, most Colorado desert turned out to be
Colorado desert. For others, it was the great coin craze of the
1960s, when new Lincoln pennies were sold for dollars as great
investments. Guess what they ended up being worth? Those who
plunged into wine futures in the 1970s drowned their sorrows in
style.
</P>
<P>
   Financial bubbles, those dangerous combinations of crowd
psychology and alluring, wispy investment offers, have a long and
painful past. Today's dot-com investors may get an education from
three of history's hottest deals: tulipmania, the South Sea bubble
and the Mississippi scheme.
</P>
<P>
   All three are in an 1841 classic that is as current as today's
stock quotes: Charles Mackay's ``Extraordinary Popular Delusions
and the Madness of Crowds.'' It is online at www.bibliomania.com,
and at sailor.gutenberg.org.
</P>
<P>
   Mackay traces the tulip from Turkey to its introduction into the
Netherlands in the mid-16th century. ``In 1634, the rage among the
Dutch to possess them was so great that the ordinary industry of
the country was neglected, and the population, even to its lowest
dregs, embarked in the tulip trade.''
</P>
<P>
   One would-be buyer offered 12 acres of land for a rare bulb. A
single example of the Viceroy variety fetched four fat oxen, eight
fat swine, 12 fat sheep, a bed, a suit of clothes, a silver
drinking cup and large quantities of wheat, rye, wine, beer, butter
and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   One common thread in these accounts is that when the bubble
bursts, it bursts quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cry of distress sounded everywhere, and each man accused
his neighbor.'' Alas, Mackay wrote, the courts refused to
interfere, ruling that tulipmania debts were gambling debts, and
unenforceable.
</P>
<P>
   A shorter account that focuses more on the tulips themselves,
``A Rambling Romp Through Tulip History,'' can be found at
www.bulb.com/historymyth/romp.html.
</P>
<P>
   The South Sea Bubble, which caused the first great British stock
market crash in 1720, began in 1711 with a plan for a private group
of merchants to enrich the public treasury by trading British goods
to the Spanish colonies in America. All they needed was an
exclusive trading right and a large loan from issuing stock,
according to Mackay's account.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody had heard of the gold and silver mines of Peru and
Mexico; every one believed them to be inexhaustible and it was only
necessary to send the manufactures of England to the coast to be
repaid a hundredfold,'' Mackay wrote. Never mind that Philip V of
Spain had no intention of allowing the English free trade with
Spanish America _ the rumors were irresistible. ``Visions of ingots
danced before their eyes,'' and warnings in parliament were drowned
out.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the oddest and most instructive outgrowths of the South
Sea Bubble were the unrelated stocks that were issued just to take
advantage of the frenzy. Mackay lists four pages of them: for
insuring horses, for rebuilding parsonages, for a perpetual motion
machine, for trading in hair, and the piece de resistance: ``for
carrying on an undertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know
what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a well-illustrated account of the South Sea Bubble in
an online Harvard Magazine reprint at
www.harvard-magazine.com/issues/mj99/damnd.html.
</P>
<P>
   The Mississippi Bubble, which occurred in France about the same
time, owed its origin to a Scotsman with the magnificently
inappropriate name of John Law. A mathematical genius and bon
vivant, according to Mackay, he developed a winning gambling system
that got him kicked out of a number of countries until he
ingratiated himself with the Duke of Orleans, who became regent to
Louis XV. Law issued notes based on the profits to be made from the
gold and silver of the Mississippi and the Louisiana Territory.
(Gold? Mississippi? Hey, it sounded good in 1718.)
</P>
<P>
   Speculation in Mississippi bonds was so great that space on
Law's street in Paris was rented for a fortune to traders. ``The
story goes that a humpbacked man who stood in the street gained
considerable sums by lending his hump as a writing desk to the
eager speculators.''
</P>
<P>
   Law was not entirely to blame, Mackay wrote: ``He did not count
on the avaricious frenzy of a whole nation; he did not see that
confidence, like mistrust, could be increased almost ad infinitum
and that hope was as extravagant as fear.''
</P>
<P>
   In his epitaph for Law, Mackay compares the bubbler to the first
unsuspecting canoeist down the Niagara River: ``He was dashed to
pieces with his bark, but the waters, maddened and turned to foam
by the rough descent, only boiled and bubbled for a time, and then
flowed on again as smoothly as ever.''  &QL;

SCANDALOUS CABINET FROM POMPEII OPENS, PARENTAL GUIDANCE
SUGGESTED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: France, Germany, Italy)  By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPLES, Italy _ The contents of the Secret Cabinet that were so
scandalous they were kept locked up for most of the last 200 years
will be unveiled to the public next week. Schoolchildren visiting
the National Archaeological Museum of Naples, however, will need
parental permission to see the exhibition. Curators delicately
refer to the Secret Cabinet or the ``Forbidden Collection,'' but
museum guards loudly direct visitors to ``il pornografico.''
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Cabinet is actually two rooms containing a vast
collection of ancient erotica: 250 frescoes, mosaics, statues,
talismans, amulets, oil lamps as well as votive _ and highly
explicit _ fertility symbols, most of them dug up during the
18th-century excavations at Pompeii and Herculaneum.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sexuality of the ancients is not the sexuality of our
times,'' Marinella Lista, a museum archaeologist warned as she
pointed out one of the most famous works in the collection, a
second-century A.D. marble statue of the mythological figure of
Pan, copulating with a goat. Discovered in 1752 during excavations
at the Villa of the Papyrus in Herculaneum, ``Pan and the Goat''
was locked away in a chest by the Bourbon King Charles III. Even
the most noted German archaeologist of the time, Johann
Winckelmann, was forbidden to see it.
</P>
<P>
   At least compared with the rather clinical depictions of human
sexual acts surrounding it, however, this statue of two creatures
gazing raptly into each other's eyes is almost romantic. ``There is
cruelty,'' Lista said, ``but there is also tenderness.''
</P>
<P>
   The collection, which amply illustrates the sexual proclivities
of pre-Roman and Roman societies, is important to historians and
archaeologists and intriguing for ordinary tourists. It is not,
however, unique. Ancient erotic artworks can be found in major
archaeological collections around the world, including the
Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Even the famous lupanare of Pompeii, brothels richly decorated
with obscene murals, are open to all visitors. Until 15 years ago
those murals were shown only to men; women and children needed to
bribe guards for a glimpse.
</P>
<P>
   The Secret Cabinet is perhaps most interesting as a reflection
of the shifting mores of recent history, a famous, rarely seen
collection that opened in rhythm with liberal political movements
that swept Europe in the 19th century and closed again when
reactionary forces regained the upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   Lista, however, seemed concerned that contemporary visitors
would draw the wrong conclusions about depravity in ancient Rome.
``Previous generations thought that the people of Pompeii were
justly punished by the volcano eruption, because they were so
lascivious,'' she said indignantly. ``Nothing could be less true.''
</P>
<P>
   The profusion of bold and bawdy Roman erotica unearthed in the
ruins led Pietro d'Onofri, a priest, to ``excommunicate'' Pompeii
in the early 1800s, saying, ``That entire city was given to the
most sordid impropriety, and so from God, it deserved, like Sodom,
the calamity of fire.'' His was a devout but somewhat empty
gesture, since Pompeii was pagan in A.D. 79, when Vesuvius erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Even broad-minded visitors like the French writer Stendhal were
taken aback that women of ancient Rome could be allowed to see such
explicit depictions of sexual acts and reproductive organs. (Lista
said, however, that Roman matrons never saw the most graphic murals
and statues, which were kept in rooms open only to men and their
concubines.)
</P>
<P>
   Obscene murals, statues and artifacts scandalized kings and
cardinals, but they also stirred 18th-century scientists. William
Hamilton, the British ambassador to the court of Naples (best known
as the cuckolded husband of Emma Hamilton, the lover of Lord
Nelson), wrote a paper in 1781 for the Royal Society of London
comparing the cult of Priapus to the contemporary Roman Catholic
cult of Sts. Cosmas and Damien in Isernia, near Naples (one of the
first anthropological comparisons of ancient and modern
examinations of sexuality). He also donated some of the phallic
votive objects he had collected to the British Museum.
</P>
<P>
   The study of Etruscan and Roman erotica was a risky business,
however. Even a well-known curator, Pierre Hugues, was expelled
from Naples in 1769 after he published a study of the secret cult
of Priapus, a compendium of lewd ancient Roman writings. (Hamilton
later rehabilitated him by hiring him as curator of his statuary
collection.)
</P>
<P>
   In 1785 King Ferdinand of Naples set aside one room in his royal
museum for obscene antiques that would be seen only with special
permission. But by 1819 the collection had been transferred to a
new museum where it was kept on open display. In 1827 an anonymous
priest wrote to Ferdinand's successor, Francis I, describing the
room as hell and begging that it be closed: ``Sire, this room is
the plague of religion. It is the corrupter of the morals of the
modest youth, the ruin of your subjects. Only in Naples do you see
such infamous things.''
</P>
<P>
   Francis complied and locked the room, opening it only to
``people of mature age and respected morals'' who had written
permission from a government minister. Predictably the Secret
Cabinet became a favorite stop for young British, European and
Russian aristocrats on the Grand Tour.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1848 revolutions that swept Europe, the collection
was re-opened for a year. After the revolutionary leader Garibaldi
defeated the Bourbons and set up his own brief dictatorship in
southern Italy in 1860, one of his first acts was to order that fig
leaves be removed from public statuary. He also demanded that the
Secret Cabinet be reopened. One of the three keys needed was
missing, so a museum craftsman broke down the door.
</P>
<P>
   After Garibaldi handed over southern Italy to King Victor
Emmanuel II in 1860, the Secret Cabinet was closed again. In 1866 a
museum curator, Francesco Fiorelli, made a catalog of the
collection, arguing that many of the objects were not obscene and
could be displayed in other parts of the museum. But his catalog
had no illustrations and used only obscure terminology
(``drillopote,'' a rarely used Italian word for vase with a figure
attached, and ``veretro,'' an amulet decorated with a phallus),
suggesting that he, too, was a bit embarrassed by his subject.
</P>
<P>
   The collection was last opened in the 1960s, but then was shut
again for restoration. It remained closed until now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously in an era of proclaimed full sexual freedom and
erotic museums opened in many European capitals, it makes no sense
to speak of a forbidden collection,'' the current curator, Stefano
De Caro, wrote in his catalog, which does include illustrations. He
said one of the Secret Cabinet's attractions was its ``ambiguous
history as a museum and nonmuseum.''

ISRAEL RELEASES LEBANESE PRISONER HELD WITHOUT CHARGES 
</HEADLINE>
   By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Israel Wednesday freed one of 16 Lebanese prisoners
who have been held without charges as ``bargaining chips'' for the
potential release of Israeli soldiers captured in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   After a decade in an Israeli prison, Ghassan al-Dirani, 35, a
former bank clerk, crossed back into Lebanon, where he was met at
the border by International Red Cross officials and his family.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, the Israeli High Court blocked a Tel Aviv
district court judge's order to free al-Dirani on humanitarian
grounds. That had been the recommendation of Israeli prison doctors
who considered him physically and mentally ill. This time when
another Tel Aviv judge issued the same release order, the High
Court did not intervene.
</P>
<P>
   Al-Dirani spent most of his captivity isolated in a prison
hospital, and attempted suicide several times, according to his
lawyer, Zvi Rish.
</P>
<P>
   Rish said his client was kidnapped in 1986 by a Christian
militia group in Beirut _ ``head-hunters'' who considered him
valuable because he is related to Mustafa al-Dirani, a former
leader of the Amal militia. He was imprisoned for four years in
Lebanon, ``and during the interrogations, he simply lost his
mind,'' Rish said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1990, Ghassan al-Dirani and several others were secretly
transferred to Israel, and their incarceration was kept hidden
until 1992. Four years later, Ghassan al-Dirani's mother tried to
visit her son, traveling into Israel on a false passport. According
to Amnesty International, she was told by a government spokesman
that there would be no meetings with Lebanese detainees until
information was released about Ron Arad, an Israeli navigator who
was captured by the Amal in 1986 after parachuting out of his jet
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Rish said that international human rights organizations had
taken a special interest in Ghassan al-Dirani's case. ``He is so
mentally ill that he does not have to be _ even if there are
bargaining chips _ he doesn't have to be in this game,'' he said.
``I hope with the perspective of time the issue will be
investigated _ how the state of Israel and the courts permitted the
holding of hostages.''
</P>
<P>
   Mustafa al-Dirani is one of the 15 remaining Lebanese detainees
in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Five others were freed last December.
</P>
<P>
   Also Wednesday, the High Court issued a temporary restraining
order to block the imminent release from jail of Yoram Skolnick,
who was convicted of murdering a bound Palestinian man and
sentenced to life in prison. His sentence was reduced by a
presidential order to 14 years, and then by prison authorities to
seven years when he met criteria for early release.
</P>
<P>
   A leftist lawmaker, Zehava Gal-on appealed his release, which
was barred temporarily Wednesday by a seven-judge team.

TECHNOLOGY STOCKS ARE HAMMERED IN ASIAN MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
   By MARK LANDLER   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ In Asia, as in the United States, the bloom is off
the rose for technology shares. But here, it has withered even more
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Stock markets from Tokyo to Singapore swooned Wednesday as
investors followed the gyrating Nasdaq in the United States by
dumping shares in technology, Internet and telecommunications
companies. The rout was most severe in Hong Kong, where the Hang
Seng index plunged 3.4 percent and popular companies like China
Telecom and Pacific Century Cyberworks led the retreat.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off has particularly troubling implications for Pacific
Century, which is using its stock as currency to finance a takeover
of Hong Kong's dominant telephone company, Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT.
Pacific Century's shares fell 11 percent, to 14.95 Hong Kong
dollars, or $1.92, a share. The shares have declined by 32 percent
since the agreement was announced in late February.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're certainly in the danger zone for this deal,'' said David
Webb, editor of Webb-site.com, an Internet service for investors.
``The institutional investors who own Cable and Wireless stock are
sensible people. There is a point at which they will reject the
transaction.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific Century deal is something of a bellwether because it
symbolizes the rise of Internet companies in Asia. The company,
controlled by a 32-year-old entrepreneur, Richard Li, has few
assets aside from a clutch of investments in Internet start-ups.
Yet it has become one of the most highly-valued stocks in Hong
Kong, rivaling the property empire of Li's father, Li Ka-shing.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To win Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT, the younger Li vanquished Singapore
Telecommunications, a much larger company controlled by the
Singapore government. He was able to do so because the board of
Cable &AMP; Wireless, the London-based parent of Cable &AMP; Wireless HKT,
concluded that selling to an Internet company was more attractive
than settling for another phone company.
</P>
<P>
   But while Cable &AMP; Wireless owns 54 percent of HKT, Li still
needs the approval of other shareholders, including China Telecom
and the Hong Kong government. He is offering two options for their
shares: all stock or stock-and-cash. The value of the all-stock
offer has dropped to $25.8 billion from $38.1 billion, while the
stock-and-cash offer has dropped to $28 billion from $35.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Webb said the erosion in Pacific Century's shares all but
guaranteed that investors would opt for the stock-and-cash offer.
That would leave HKT's majority owner, Cable &AMP; Wireless, with less
cash and a larger stake in Pacific Century. Cable and Wireless has
pledged to sell a chunk of that stake soon after the deal is
completed, which will put further pressure on Pacific Century's
shares.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts said they were baffled by the open-ended nature of
the deal. ``Cable &AMP; Wireless didn't negotiate a collar on the
stock, they didn't negotiate a walk-away price, and the break-up
fee is minimal,'' said Henry Lee, managing director of Hendale
Ventures, an asset management firm in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   But other analysts pointed out that Pacific Century will not
make a formal offer to shareholders until May 18. Given the wild
swings in technology shares, Pacific Century's stock price could
well rebound by then. Despite the steady erosion in the company's
shares, there have been no public indications of concern, either
from Cable &AMP; Wireless or from other HKT shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Pacific Century declined to comment Wednesday,
noting only that the terms of the deal would not be modified.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Pacific Century was far from the only technology stock punished
in Hong Kong on Wednesday. Three of the hottest local Internet
start-ups _ Tom.com, Hongkong.com, and Sunevision _ plunged 16.6
percent, 16.8 percent, and 12.2 percent respectively. After soaring
into the stratosphere, these companies are now trading below the
price at which they went public a few weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nor was the bad news limited to Hong Kong. In Tokyo, two of the
most prominent new-economy stocks also continued to languish.
Softbank, which owns a portfolio of Internet investments, fell by
the Nikkei's one-day trading limit of 5,000 yen, or $47.61, to
close at 76,500 yen, or $728.57.
</P>
<P>
   Hikari Tsushin, which sells cellular phones and has a joint
venture with Pacific Century, was halted for a fourth consecutive
session, as orders to sell shares swamped orders to buy. The
company recently warned of much larger-than-expected losses in the
six-month period that ended in February.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the angst, many analysts said this was a much-needed
correction for Asian markets that had become dangerously
overheated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tech bubble is finally bursting,'' said Marc Faber, the
head of his own investment firm here. ``In order to burst a bubble,
people have to lose money. Now, people are losing money.''

 &HT;    GROUP URGES MANDATORY HEARING TESTS FOR ALL NEWBORNS
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newborns should receive mandatory hearing tests
from hospitals before they are taken home, a national group said
Wednesday as it released its state-by-state report card on newborn
hearing screenings.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 babies are born deaf or with serious hearing
loss annually, and it sometimes takes parents up to two years to
find out, according to Hear Us: The National Campaign for Hearing
Health (NCHH).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 22 babies who go home every day without being able to
hear their parents say 'I love you,''' said Elizabeth A. Foster,
campaign director of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Laura Miller of Long Island, N.Y., are parents of two
hearing-impaired children. They told a forum hosted by NCHH that
they did not realize that their oldest daughter, Veronica, 5, was
deaf until she was 14 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, with mandatory testing at birth, Veronica would not
have any speech delays today,'' said a sobbing Tom Miller. ``With a
simple inexpensive test given at birth, you are not going to
eliminate hearing loss, but you can identify it and address it.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Newborn Hearing Screenings (UNHS), a system that tests
hearing abilities shortly after birth, costs as little as $20.
</P>
<P>
   But less than 35 percent of all newborns in the United States
are tested for hearing because hospitals are not required to
administer the test, and parents don't know that they should get
their children tested at birth, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is launching a campaign, called May Babies, aimed at
increasing by 50 percent the number of newborns who are screened
for hearing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing deficiencies can affect a child's cognitive, language
and academic development, said Dr. Eugene Sussman, a pediatrician
at Holy Cross in Maryland. But if detected early enough, he said,
steps can be taken to help the child.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 states have adopted policies or mandates supporting
UNHS, according to the NCHH report card. Of those states, nine got
grades of excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas received a ``good'' rating, while Florida, Ohio and
Georgia were given grades of ``fair.'' Georgia and Texas have
enacted screening legislation, while bills are pending in Ohio and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's legislation encourages, but does not mandate
screenings. Georgia screens 21 percent of babies born in the state
annually, while Florida screens 25.8 percent for hearing. Ohio
screens 17.3 percent of its newborns, and Texas screens 26.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Congress last November passed the Infant Hearing Screening Act,
sponsored by Rep. Greg Walsh, R-Ore. The three-year law gives seed
money in the form of grants to states that want to set up their own
UNHS programs.
</P>
<P>
   States can apply for the grants through the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention or the Health Resources Service
Administration. Both organizations were allocated $3.5 million
under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give our kids the chance to hear the rush of a stream,
to hear the genius of Mozart or Wynton Marsalis,'' said Walsh, who
for nine years had been unsuccessful in his attempts to get the
legislation to pass in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have all the research and all the legislation we want,
but it won't make a difference if parents don't get involved and

LAPTOPS OF LUXURY: PRICE IS AN AFTERTHOUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   By PETER H. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Why is this man smiling? Here he is, stuck in the middle seat
between two large people in the third-to-last row of coach on a
bumpy, 1,500-mile, early Sunday morning flight.
</P>
<P>
   But all is well; because the Apple PowerBook G3 portable
Macintosh computer I'm testing has a gorgeous 14-inch,
high-resolution screen, a DVD drive and ample battery life to show
a full-length movie.
</P>
<P>
   High-end laptop computers, the kind that are powerful enough to
serve as desktop computer replacements, are getting fancier all the
time. For people who are willing to pay first-class prices, the
PowerBook G3 and its high-altitude Windows-based counterparts
provide the convenience of portability without sacrificing power or
features.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of power and portability does not come cheap.
High-end laptops cost $3,000 to nearly $5,000, easily double the
cost of comparable desktop computers. But for those who would
otherwise consider buying two computers, one for the desktop and
one for the road, investing in one of these double-duty laptops may
make financial sense.
</P>
<P>
   The PowerBook G3 I traveled with is more powerful than the iMac
DV SE desktop computer I bought recently ($1,499), and I was
surprised to discover that it has the same size display screen. At
the same time, at just over 6 pounds it weighs a half pound less
than Apple's top of the line portable iBook SE ($1,799), and yet is
much more powerful.
</P>
<P>
   The PowerBook G3 500 costs $3,499, or $200 more than the two
lesser computers combined. However, there is something appealing
about having just one computer and not having to worry about two
sets of data and applications. (Unless, of course, there are other
family members who compete for computer time. In that case, two
computers are always better than one.)
</P>
<P>
   The PowerBook takes up less desk space than a desktop PC, which
is important to people who live and work in cramped spaces. It is
trim enough to be locked in a desk drawer for security.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the PowerBook G3 is much too large to use on the
seat-back tray in coach, especially when the passenger in front
puts her seat all the way back and appears to be doing the
Macarena. So, to protect its screen, the G3 goes on my lap. If my
legs had not gone numb early in the flight, I might have found the
heat generated by the computer to be uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   The heat comes from the 500 MHz G3 processor with a generous 1
megabyte of performance boosting level 2 backside cache. The unit I
tested also had 12 gigabytes of storage and 128 megabytes of system
memory. A decent ATI Rage video card with 8 megabytes of video
memory keeps the display colorful and lively.
</P>
<P>
   As impressive as those specifications are, the PowerBook G3 500
is not the most powerful laptop on the market these days. There are
several 650 MHz Pentium III rivals on the Windows side, with larger
hard disks. The 14-inch screen is not the largest in its price
class, but it is plenty big enough to do justice to business
presentations or DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   Without doubt, however, the PowerBook is the best-looking
portable around. Sleek and midnight black, it has a translucent
white Apple logo in the center of the lid that glows like a full
moon when the computer is awake, and a lightning-bug green power
light that throbs on and off while it is asleep.
</P>
<P>
   And the PowerBook has many bonus features that set it apart from
its rivals, starting with the Mac OS 9 operating system. It comes
with a pair of USB connectors for attaching external devices like a
mouse and a keyboard, and with an external monitor it becomes a
stylish desktop machine. Memory can be boosted from the standard
128 megabytes to up to 512 megabytes, and an 18GB hard drive is an
option.
</P>
<P>
   Like other Macintoshes, the PowerBook comes standard with an
Ethernet high-speed networking card, which can be used to connect
to a cable modem for an office network, as well as a built-in 56K
modem for connecting to the Internet over regular phone wires.
</P>
<P>
   Like other current Macs, it has built-in antennas for Apple's
AirPort high-speed wireless networking system (a $99 AirPort
networking card must be installed under the keyboard, which
requires some dexterity and patience). Because neither I nor the
pilot particularly cared to see if there were any sensitive
avionics devices in the cockpit that I could network with at 41,000
feet, I disabled the AirPort feature before takeoff.
</P>
<P>
   The PowerBook really excels when it comes to multimedia. It has
a pair of high-speed Firewire (IEEE 1394) ports for attaching
digital video cameras, and an S-Video Out port for sending video to
an S-Video-equipped television or video tape recorder. The DVD-ROM
drive plays audio CD's and CD-ROM discs as well as DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   The battery life is exceptional, up to 5 hours. The DVD-ROM
drive can be popped out and replaced with a second battery,
yielding up to 10 hours of use between charges.
</P>
<P>
   At just over 6 pounds, though, the PowerBook is not an ideal
traveling companion unless one is seriously into Web design,
business presentations or video production.
</P>
<P>
   Video is certainly one of Apple's strengths, both on the desktop
and in its PowerBook line. To show off its strengths, Apple loaded
my borrowed PowerBook with Final Cut Pro, a professional-quality
video editing program that costs nearly $1,000, and sent it along
with a Canon Optura digital video camera (about $1,500). Thus
equipped, the PowerBook becomes a mobile video production lab.
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine the antitrust lawyers at the Justice Department
running around with such a system, making home movies of their
gleeful victory parties this week after Microsoft was found to have
illegally exploited its Windows monopoly to stifle competition.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of Windows, the biggest news in high-end notebook
computers is the arrival of Intel's SpeedStep processor technology
(formerly code-named Geyserville), which allows the chip to vary
its speed depending on whether the computer is plugged into the
wall or running on batteries.
</P>
<P>
   If it is plugged in, the computer runs at top speed; if it is
unplugged, it ``steps down'' to a lower, power-saving speed. An
Intel rival, Advanced Micro Devices, is expected to have similar
chips this summer. Dell's new Inspiron 5000 G650VT, for example,
operates at 650 megahertz on alternating current, but ratchets down
to 500 MHz when it is unplugged, which extends the battery life for
a handful of minutes. Most people won't notice the battery savings
or the difference in processing power unless they are doing
processor-intensive applications.
</P>
<P>
   If you use your flight time to work through e-mail messages,
compose memos and make up Internet business plans, save your money
and get a cheaper portable with a one-speed chip. But if you travel
frequently, need a powerful computer and consider battery life to
be precious, the SpeedStep technology may be worth it.

THE SUPREME COURT TELLS JOE CAMEL: HAPPY DAYS ARE HERE AGAIN

 &HT;    
 By STEPHEN L. COHEN  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    
 &HT;    
 &HT;    The smirk on Joe Camel's face has grown a bit larger of late,
thanks to his new pals William Rehnquist, Antonin Scalia, Anthony
Kennedy and Clarence Thomas. The famed outdoorsman, gambler and
raconteur has good reason to smile. After being pummeled by
anti-smoking forces for years, he just got the latest news from
Washington: Happy days are here again.
 &HT;    The Supreme Court, in fact, has just handed cigarette companies
a rare victory in one of the most pivotal battles of the tobacco
wars. Rebuffing President Clinton, the court ruled that the Food
and Drug Administration lacks the authority to regulate tobacco,
effectively bringing much of the government's anti-smoking
initiative to a dramatic halt.
 &HT;    The decision, which prevailed by just one vote, will have a
profound impact on public health because it blocks federal efforts
to protect the nation's youth from the hazards of smoking. A vital
array of FDA regulations to discourage teenage smoking -- from
advertising restrictions to rules governing sales to minors -- must
be rescinded in the wake of the court's decision.
 &HT;    In the long saga of the tobacco wars, already fraught with
misfortune, this new development represents a major setback. Just
when it seemed that the nation was finally coming to grips with the
single most preventable cause of death in America, the Supreme
Court has stymied further progress with a narrowly drawn
interpretation of the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA).
 &HT;    Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, writing the majority opinion,
seemed to acknowledge this reality when she noted that smoking
``poses perhaps the single most significant threat to public
health'' in the U.S. Nonetheless, she argued for a narrow
interpretation of the FDCA, despite the huge stakes involved.
 &HT;    This is unfortunate, because such an interpretation consigns
millions of Americans to the prospect of premature death and
disability. Given the ambiguity of the law, it seems an
unnecessarily dogmatic decree.
 &HT;    Writing the dissenting opinion for the court, Justice Stephen G.
Breyer stressed the importance of this very issue. He contended
that when assessing the agency's authority to regulate tobacco, it
is crucial to consider the basic purpose of the FDA: ``the overall
protection of public health.''
 &HT;    Precisely. When considering a product that kills more people
each year than AIDS, car accidents, alcohol, homicides, drugs,
suicides and fires COMBINED, it seems reasonable to take an
expansive view of FDA authority that is consistent with its
legislatively mandated role to protect the public welfare.
 &HT;    Yet the conservative majority of the court ignored this
reasoning, choosing instead to take a much more limited view of the
agency's domain. Such a limited view does little to advance the
cause of public health, which happens to be the statutory realm of
the FDA.
 &HT;    The convoluted reasoning doesn't end there. Curiously, the court
cited the unusual nature of the case in order to justify a more
restrictive view of FDA authority. After recognizing that an agency
can set its own agenda in cases of ``legislative ambiguity'' (in
which the intent of Congress is unclear), the court then argued
that this prerogative should not be used in extraordinary
situations like the tobacco case.
 &HT;    Extraordinary indeed. But the court wasn't referring to the
appalling health effects of smoking here -- it was referring
instead to tobacco's ``unique political history,'' which apparently
obliges the court to exercise great care before granting the FDA
broader authority over cigarettes.
 &HT;    If this sounds like a lot of energetic posturing to justify a
rather contorted, precarious position, perhaps it reflects the
court's discomfort with the ramifications of its decision.
 &HT;    After all, the central issue of this case involves the
appropriate role of government in managing a public health crisis
of enormous magnitude. Regrettably, as more than 400,000 Americans
are killed each year by smoking, the Supreme Court seems content to
focus on other issues like the unique political history of tobacco.
 &HT;    The point here isn't that Congress's intent regarding the FDA is
clear. It isn't, as we've seen over the last two years as
legislators have proven incapable of passing comprehensive tobacco
legislation. But something else is quite clear: hundreds of
thousands of people are dying unnecessarily as the tools to save
them remain underutilized. The question is, when will the
legislative and judicial branches of government allow the executive
branch to do its job?
 &HT;    Whether one takes a conservative or more expansive view of FDA
jurisdiction, one thing is certain: in the absence of aggressive
federal action to reduce smoking, millions more will die in the
coming years. Given the uncertainty regarding congressional
intentions -- and the Supreme Court's inability to reach a
consensus even among its own members -- it is tragic that the
justices have allowed a narrow interpretation of the law to do so
much harm to America's nascent anti-smoking campaign.

MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES MUST BECOME SENSITIVE TO HUMAN RIGHTS,
REPORT SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ A multinational corporation prepares for a major
investment in a troubled part of the world. The pickings, from oil
or mining or cheap labor, stand to be enormous. But the local
government is corrupt. Its security forces are brutal. What does
the company do?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, according to a report released in London on
Wednesday night by Amnesty International, the answer is fraught
with a new kind corporate risk, not just for the company's
operations but its global reputation, retention of quality staff
and, ultimately, its shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   In the modern, wired world, the company's activities will not
simply fall under the microscopic scrutiny of advocacy groups, the
report says, but those same groups will spread their assertions and
criticism around the world within seconds on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Far more than in the past, the report argues, a multinational
company's stance on human rights will be considered part of its
performance.
</P>
<P>
   And, it says, companies must be prepared to confront the
governments that host them about issues ranging from political
repression to child labor.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no hiding place,'' said Sir Geoffrey Chandler of
Amnesty International, the London-based human rights monitoring
group that composed the report along with the Prince of Wales
Business Leaders Forum, an advocacy organization supported by
Britain's Prince Charles to promote socially responsible business
practises.
</P>
<P>
   ``To go without a policy on human rights is to go naked into a
dangerous world,'' said Chandler in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The report, titled ``Human Rights _ Is It Any of Your
Business?,'' signals the beginning of a new campaign by activists
to hold corporate behavior to standards that many multinational
corporations once had sought to dismiss at their peril.
</P>
<P>
   It cites, for instance, the experience of Royal Dutch Shell in
Nigeria's Niger Delta in the mid-1990s, when the oil company's
activities were caught between a repressive, military regime and
increasingly vocal protesters demanding a greater share of Shell's
production.The conflict led to the execution of nine activists in
1995 _ and, immediately afterwards, demands for a boycott of Shell
products. The result, the report says, was that Shell revised its
business principles to commit itself to upholding human rights.
</P>
<P>
   The report's insistence that other corporations should follow
the lead of companies such as Shell, BP Amoco PLC, Reebok
International and Levi Strauss &AMP; Co. reflects how activist and
advocacy groups have increasingly challenged businesses over their
practices.
</P>
<P>
   In Britain, consumer advocacy groups have succeeded in virtually
driving genetically modified foods off supermarket shelves.
Corporations are expected to routinely report on their
environmental record. Pressure from U.S. and British advocacy
groups in the 1990s forced new scrutiny of the way child labor was
used in the Asian sporting goods industry, from footwear to
soccer-balls.
</P>
<P>
   But the newest campaign takes aim not so much at consumers as at
the boardrooms of big, international companies, urging the most
senior managers to consider the hazards of ignoring issues such as
labor rights, local land rights, the use of security forces to
protect foreign installations and the dilemmas of operating under
corrupt regimes or in war-zones. All those factors, it argues, have
become more relevant as multinational corporations play an
increasingly dominant role in economic development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies have a direct self-interest in using their
legitimate influence to protect and promote the human rights of
their employees and of the communities within which they are
investing and/or operating,'' the report says. ``The increasing
scrutiny of corporate behavior by the media, consumer groups,
community organizations, local and international nongovernmental
organizations, and the immediacy of global communication leave
companies with little, if any, hiding place.''
</P>
<P>
   The report urges that companies incorporate explicit commitments
to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in their central
strategies and operating procedures and accept outside scrutiny of
their performance. ``There can be no neutrality,'' Chandler said in
the interview. ``If you are silent, you are going to be seen as
complicit.''
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Wednesday night how the report would be
received in business circles. However, a survey by Britain's
Ashridge business school released Wednesday night in conjunction
with the report suggested that human rights issues are finding
their way onto corporate agendas.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of Fortune 500 companies said 36 percent of
respondents ``have decided not to proceed with a proposed
investment project because of concerns over human rights issues''
while 19 percent ``have disinvested from a particular country
because of concerns'' about the same issues. It also found that
less than half _ 44 percent _ of companies with a code of ethics or
business principles ``make explicit reference to human rights.''

 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ Capping an extraordinary morning of abruptly shifting
emotions, Japan's parliament Wednesday elected a new prime
minister, replacing Keizo Obuchi, who was left in a coma by a
stroke over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's successor, Yoshiro Mori, was nominated, as expected, by
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party after a party meeting Wednesday
morning. His candidacy was quickly put to a vote before the two
houses of parliament, which overwhelmingly approved.
</P>
<P>
   Teary remembrances of Obuchi made by the leader of the caretaker
government the night before gave way to Mori's selection in an
almost lusty acclamation by the Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers,
and then to his confirmation by an overwhelming vote in the Diet.
</P>
<P>
   Mori needed 245 votes for a majority in the lower house, and he
received 335 of 488 votes cast. In the upper house he won 137 of
244 votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will continue to pursue Obuchi's economic revitalization
policies and make every effort to restore the economy to stable
growth,'' said Mori, a burly former rugby player and debating team
colleague of Obuchi's from their days together at Tokyo's
prestigious Waseda University. Both men are 62 years old.
</P>
<P>
   The speedy ratification put to rest concerns about a power
vacuum, which were voiced within the governing party after Obuchi's
hospitalization late Sunday and immediately triggered an electoral
scramble to decide who would be Japan's next popularly elected
leader.
</P>
<P>
   With Liberal Democratic Party leaders eager for prompt elections
that would in theory give them a sympathy vote in the wake of
Obuchi's catastrophic stroke, many legislators hastily left the
parliament after the ratification of Mori, hoping to book trains
and flights back to their districts to prepare for elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are strong feelings within LDP that we should quickly
dissolve parliament and hold elections as quickly as possible,
because the sympathy vote may be easy to get,'' said Hiroshi
Mitsuzuka, a former finance minister and close friend of Mori.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the deep superstitions that prevail in Japanese
politics, ruling party members were said to favor June 4 for the
upcoming vote, in part because the date is considered reasonably
auspicious according to Chinese astrological calendars.
</P>
<P>
   Politicians said other considerations in arranging a quick vote
included a summit meeting of leading economic powers, the Group of
Eight, scheduled for July in Okinawa. Also, the transition of power
from Obuchi to Mori, after a brief caretaker's turn at the helm by
Mikio Aoki, was regarded by many Japanese as an episode of
political razzle-dazzle unworthy of a major economic power and
putative democracy.
</P>
<P>
   Aoki claimed that his legitimacy as caretaker was based on what
he said was a conversation he had with Obuchi during his illness,
in which he said the prime minister had asked him to take over the
government temporarily. Aoki announced Obuchi's illness to the
nation 22 hours after the prime minister was hospitalized. What
ensued were further secretive rounds of maneuverings, which
produced Mori as the governing party's standard bearer.
</P>
<P>
   If Mori's route to Japan's top political office was
controversial, little about his style could be described that way.
The longtime Liberal Democratic Party stalwart is expected to
continue most of the policies of his predecessor and work hard to
avoid rocking the boat. The intended tack was made clear by Mori's
re-adoption of the entire Obuchi Cabinet, which had resigned
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In case the message was lost on anyone, Mori, who was previously
his party's secretary-general, used baseball imagery in an early
morning exchange Wednesday with journalists to explain his
intentions. ``I was a catcher for Obuchi,'' he said. ``I think it
is important to carry through what he wanted to accomplish and what
he was concerned with.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Mori's retention of the old Cabinet and plans to carry out
Obuchi's policies were also reminders for many that he has no
popular mandate and occupies a tenuous position as interim leader
at a time when the Liberal Democratic Party's governing coalition
is deeply unpopular and saddled with stubborn economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   The governing party's chief coalition partner, the New Komeito
Party, is a Buddhist-affiliated group that many voters disapprove
of as blurring the lines between church and state.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition leaders, sensing that the coming elections may be
their best chance in years to unseat the conservative Liberal
Democrats, who have governed for all but two years since 1955, were
quick to drive home these points.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new Cabinet will demonstrate that the LDP is reaching a
dead end, and I don't think that Mr. Mori will be able to break
through the wall,'' Kazuo Shii, secretary-general of the Communist
Party, said. ``It is worth mentioning that his appointment is not
something that has been submitted to the approval of the people of
Japan. More correctly, it is an appointment that defies the will of
the people of Japan.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as they expressed trepidation about a possible sympathy
vote on behalf of the Liberal Democratic Party, other opposition
leaders said they felt the Japanese electorate was deeply
disillusioned with the state of the country after 10 years of
recession and a spate of recent scandals involving abuse of
authority, and would be particularly receptive to a campaign of
ideas about government reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Obuchi administration enjoyed a number of successes in
pulling Japan from the depths of a near economic meltdown in the
late 1990s. But it has kept the economy going largely through huge
spending programs on public works projects and by protecting
industries that are not competitive.
</P>
<P>
   Although Japan cannot easily abandon its heavy spending for fear
of triggering a deep recession, the country is fast approaching
dangerous levels of public debt for programs that in many cases
will never prove productive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next election will be a battle between the LDP and its
coalition partners, which are wasting public funds by scattering
money about for public works, versus an opposition, which is very
serious about structural reform,'' said Naoto Kan, the policy chief
of the Democratic Party of Japan, the leading opposition group.
``In terms of message, I think things will be very clear.''

&HT;     TOP DEMOCRAT ACCUSES GOP OF RAISING MONEY FROM GONZALEZ CASE  
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)   
 &HT;     By STEWART M. POWELL   
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The chairman of the Democratic party on Wednesday
cited a fundraising appeal by Florida Republicans to accuse the GOP
of using the custody battle over 6-year-old Elian Gonzalez to raise
campaign donations.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph J. Andrew, the national chairman of the Democratic party,
made the allegation after releasing an intercepted GOP fund-raising
appeal that condemned the Clinton administration's handling of the
Gonzalez case.
</P>
<P>
   The February letter appealed for donations to serve as a
``powerful force against the Democrats and the liberals who act
cowardly before the intimidating tactics, the hysterical speeches
and the criminal lies of (Fidel) Castro.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida GOP Chairman Al Cardenas, a Cuban-born U.S.-educated
lawyer, signed the fundraising appeal.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore and other Democrats are ``struggling to make sure we
have the best interests of the child'' at heart, ``we've got
Republicans here fundraising on it,'' Andrew declared.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said the four-page GOP fundraising appeal was ``literally
an attempt to make direct political hay (and) raise cash over a
6-year-old boy's plight,'' adding that it is ``unconscionable''
that Republicans are ``taking a complicated issue and trying to
raise dollars off of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Portia Palmer, a spokeswoman for the Florida Republican party in
Tallahassee, Fla., conceded that the criticism was ``appropriate''
but emphasized that the fundraising letter was sent to ``a limited
mailing list'' in February and repudiated by the Florida GOP in
March.
</P>
<P>
   The Florida Republican party has forwarded all proceeds from the
mailing to the Elian Gonzalez Legal Defense Fund, Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   The fund is helping to finance efforts by Gonzalez' Miami-based
relatives to enable the youngster to remain in the United States
rather than return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer declined to discuss the number of letters mailed or the
amount of money turned over to the Gonzalez fund.
</P>
<P>
   The statement issued by the Florida GOP on Wednesday said ``the
Democrats are late and wrong on the real issue at hand,'' adding
that the Clinton administration has been responsible for ``8 years
of capitulation toward the Castro dictatorship'' and for the legal
``limbo'' suffered by Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has been staying with anti-Castro relatives in Florida
since being rescued at sea on Thanksgiving Day after his mother and
10 other Cubans died when their boat capsized while trying to reach
the United States. The boy's parents had been divorced.
</P>
<P>
   His father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez, who lives in Cuba, won a
go-ahead from Castro on Wednesday to travel to the United States to
stay with his son until the custody battle is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department set a Thursday deadline for the boy's
Miami relatives to sign an agreement promising to return the boy to
his father if they lose their case in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew distributed the intercepted Republican fundraising appeal
after defending Gore's controversial public break with the Clinton
administration last Thursday to support an effort to keep Gonzalez
in the United States so that a Florida family court could
adjudicate the custody battle.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew insisted that Gore's announcement 18 weeks into the
controversy was a sign of political courage rather than evidence
that the vice president was bending to political pressure to curry
favor with the Cuban American community in South Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm actually very proud that he did it,'' Andrew said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has scheduled campaign stops in Florida on Thursday and
Friday, with stops in Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew said Democrats believe that Gore has a good chance to
carry Florida and its 25 electoral votes in November despite the
fact that the state's governor, Jeb Bush, is a younger brother of
the presumptive GOP presidential nominee, Texas Gov. George W.
Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Gore hopes to repeat President Clinton's feat in 1996 when he
carried Florida by 6 percentage points over Republican Bob Dole to
become only the third Democrat in the 10 elections since 1960 to
carry the nation's fourth largest state.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton recovered from his 1992 defeat in Florida in part by
boosting his share of the state's Hispanic vote from 31 percent in
1992 to 42 percent in 1996. Florida's 800,000 Cuban-Americans make
up the largest share of Hispanics in Florida, who account for 12
percent of the voting-age population.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is clearly a state that's in play,'' Andrew told
reporters. ``We have no secret signal that we believe that Florida
is a state that we can win and we're going to make sure that we
have the resources and the time and the energy to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Recent opinion surveys found the state up for grabs. A
Mason-Dixon poll completed on March 8 showed Bush leading Gore in
the state, 45 percent to 37 percent. A Rasmussen Research survey
completed March 16 showed Gore leading Bush, 43 percent to 37
percent.

 &HT;    FLASHES BRIGHTER THAN A MILLION GALAXIES MYSTIFY ASTRONOMERS
 &HT;    750&AMP;add. For release Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    Eds: Second in the occasional ``Window on the Universe'' series.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For roughly 30 years, astronomers have known that
mysterious flashes of radiation are lighting up the distant
universe about 100 times a day, each with the energy of all the
stars of a million galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, more than 170 different explanations of what
is going on have been suggested. Nearly all of them have been
proved wrong, and Stan Woosley was the author of five of them.
</P>
<P>
   So, Woosley remains cautious about the growing popularity among
physicists of his sixth explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wrong before,'' said the University of California,
Santa Monica, astrophysicist, ``so I like to keep a certain amount
of skepticism, even about my own models.''
</P>
<P>
   In about three years, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration plans to launch a ``low-budget'' $163 million
satellite called ``Swift'' to make the observations that could
finally determine whether Woosley's newest theory is correct.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is built around a scenario in which an extremely
large star abruptly collapses, then explodes in what astronomers
are calling a ``hypernova.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause of the bursts, astronomers agree they
represent the most violent explosions to occur since the ``Big
Bang,'' in which the universe is believed to have originated
billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation from a gamma ray burst taking place 5,000 light years
(or about 30,000 trillion miles) from the Earth would burn away the
ozone layer and wipe out life on the planet, some scientists
believe. That's not a likely prospect, since the bursts are
believed to occur only once every 10 million years in our entire
galaxy, which is 100,000 light years across.
</P>
<P>
   If a burst occurred at a distance of about 50,000 light years,
it would shine as brightly as the noonday sun for a minute or two,
then disappear forever.
</P>
<P>
   This fleeting nature of gamma ray bursts has frustrated
scientists for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Some bursts last for a minute or two, others for a fraction of a
second. Like camera flashes you see from the corner of your eye,
then turn to find gone, the bursts fade rapidly from view and with
one notable exception, astronomers have never seen one.
</P>
<P>
   If it works as intended, the Swift satellite will detect a gamma
ray burst, then wheel about and focus its onboard telescopes on the
site while the event is still going on.
</P>
<P>
   Gamma ray bursts were first observed on July 2, 1967, said Neil
Gehrels, head of the gamma ray astrophysics branch of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force ``Vela'' satellites had been placed in orbit to
monitor Soviet compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by
watching for the high-energy gamma rays given off by nuclear
explosions. Soon, it became apparent that the satellites were
detecting gamma ray events that did not originate on the Earth's
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Since gamma rays from the bursts are absorbed by the atmosphere,
these phenomena had never been detected before.
</P>
<P>
   About two years later, satisfied the phenomena had no military
significance, Air Force officials revealed their existence,
creating overnight a new branch of astronomy and astrophysics and
setting in motion the three-decade search for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Woosley said he has ``loved things that go kaboom'' since
childhood, when he used a toy chemistry set and a small tank of
propane to blow up a backyard shed. His gamma ray bursts, however,
are confined to the innards of a computer, which he used to make
complicated calculations describing the explosion of an star 30
times or more the size of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   He figured the explosion would send ``jets'' of matter racing
through space at 99.995 percent of the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   When these jets collide with wispy-thin clouds of gas that
surround the exploded star, the gamma ray burst is created, Woosley
thinks. Because they are moving at a speed that is at the very edge
of scientific imagination, the particles within the jet collide
with the gas clouds and with each other with such awful force that
a beam of gamma rays, visible light and X-rays is propelled into
space in the direction of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the Earth lies in the path of the beam would it be
seen. The fact that the bursts are seen about once a day implies
that another 99 or so are happening but point away from this
planet, Woosley says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our model can explain the bursts that last around 20
seconds,'' Woosley said, ``but not the burst that lasts only
three-tenths of a second. We think that some other model, like
merging neutron stars, might explain those.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The collision of two neutron stars would amount to about the
biggest atom smasher imaginable. Both stars would be converted to
raw energy in a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   But Bohdan Paczynski, a Princeton University astrophysicist who
proposed the merging neutron star model, says he has become
skeptical about all of the explanations, including his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long chain of if-if-if and hypotheses and so on,''
he said, ``but observational evidence is limited. I am very cynical
about the models. I used to do this myself and it is difficult to
be very positive or very negative about any specific model.''
</P>
<P>
   What's needed, Paczynski said, is more observation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, astronomers have seen only a dim ``afterglow'' of gamma
ray bursts, and they believe these represent the supernova
explosions the jets left behind. Instruments aboard NASA's Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory, launched in 1991, have been detecting the
bursts for the past decade and locating them within general regions
of sky roughly as large as 1,600 full moons.
</P>
<P>
   By the time, astronomical telescopes can search such an area,
the burst has long faded.
</P>
<P>
   One gamma ray burst has been seen directly, and that was
achieved with the help of the Internet and the 800-millimeter lens
of a Canon telephoto camera like those use by ``paparazzi''
celebrity photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists at Goddard, the University of Michigan, and the Los
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories used an an
Internet link to monitor Compton detections of gamma ray burst
events. Four of the Canon cameras automatically aim at the spot
where the Compton detected the bursts and start clicking away.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are far less powerful than astronomical telescopes,
the Canons cover a much larger area of sky, and on Jan. 23, 1999,
one of them photographed a burst of visible light inside the area
where the Compton had detected gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
   The light grew increasingly brighter for several minutes, then
faded. Astronomers are convinced it was the visible portion of the
event that created the gamma ray signal. But it was little more
than a small dot that became a large dot before fading away
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The event that caused the light appears to have happened 9
billion years ago, said Michigan physicist Carl Akerlof, director
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a failure of one of its guidance systems, NASA has
decided to ``de-orbit'' the Compton in the next few weeks in an
effort to avoid having it fall onto a populated area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a sad moment for us,'' Akerlof said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Swift satellite is in orbit, the observations will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   NASA astronomer Ann Parsons said gamma ray sensors on the
satellite will cover virtually the entire sky at all times. Small
blocks of lead will be scattered over the sensor panels in random
arrangements, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since lead absorbs gamma rays, the blocks will throw gamma
``shadows'' on the sensor panels, and an onboard computer will uses
these shadows to calculate more precisely the location of the
bursts.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite will then evaluate this information to decide
whether to swing around and aim its visible light and X-ray
telescopes at the spot, Parsons said. Such considerations as
whether the maneuver would expose the spacecraft's telescopes to
ruinous rays from the sun will go into the computer's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 12 to 14 hours it now takes for close-up views of
the bursts, Swift will theoretically be able to start snapping
pictures within 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers can barely wait to get a look at those pictures.
</P>
<P>
   During a breakfast speech recently, Akerlof held up a bran
muffin to describe the enormous size of the event that caused the
flash recorded by his Canon cameras last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The amount of matter that is converted to energy in a
one-megaton thermonuclear explosion is about the size of this
muffin,'' he said. ``But in a gamma ray burst, the quantity of
matter found in the sun appears to be converted to energy in about
10 seconds.''
</P>
<P>
   It should make quite a celebrity photograph.

<TEXT>
<P>
   On their February ski vacation to Crested Butte in Colorado,
Madeline Bayard and Wendy Black woke one morning to whiteout
conditions and a tough decision: Should they waste valuable
vacation time waiting for the weather to improve or brave the
storm? Emboldened by a pair of $90 palm-size two-way radios that
would let them find each other if separated, or even call for help,
they decided to strap on their skis.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, later that day the two did become separated, and Bayard
was uneasy. ``It was like skiing in a pillowcase,'' she said. Cold
and unhappy, she turned to the radio, which she had bought back
home in Baltimore, and called for Black. ``When Wendy's voice came
back, it was like, `Yeah!''' Bayard recalled. They rendezvoused and
traded cold toes on the slopes for warm drinks in the lodge.
</P>
<P>
   Small but powerful two-way radios _ updated versions of the
walkie-talkie _ are growing in popularity among families on the go,
gadgeteers, hikers, cyclists, roller skaters and other sports
enthusiasts.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission had these very people in
mind when it created the Family Radio Service in 1996 and carved
out a section of the airwaves for it. The FRS handles two-way
radios that broadcast up to two miles; no license is required.
Radio manufacturers won approval to produce 14 FRS models in 1997,
41 in 1998, 72 in 1999 and 23 so far this year, a testament to the
demand for these devices.
</P>
<P>
   The radios have become popular partly because they are so easy
to use _ the push of a button is all that is needed to communicate
with friends or family members on the other side of a shopping
mall, at the base of a ski run or farther up the road or trail. Any
number of radios, even ones from different manufacturers, can be
used together.
</P>
<P>
   Most of these short-distance radios offer communication over 14
channels, with 38 squelch settings that help the user block out
other people's conversations. By selecting the same channel and the
same squelch setting, two or more people can have a conversation
and effectively block transmissions from other users who are within
range but are not on the same setting (although the conversation is
not private _ it can be overheard by others tuned in to that
frequency).
</P>
<P>
   The radios cost roughly $35 to $200 each, (street prices can be
much lower than list prices), with the least expensive models
featuring fewer than 14 channels and no squelch settings. The more
expensive radios come with many extra features, like
voice-activated transmissions for hands-free operation, a choice of
sounds to signify incoming calls (including vibration), a built-in
weather radio or a scramble mode that makes your conversation
unintelligible to nearby listeners using a different brand.
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, however, the manufacturers will
introduce new models that really load on the extras. Motorola will
offer a model with a digital compass, thermometer, altimeter,
barometer and FM radio. Cobra will have a unit with a weather radio
that will turn on automatically for an alert. And Audiovox will
sell a radio with a Global Positioning System receiver to pinpoint
locations.
</P>
<P>
   The radios are also popular because they are generally less
expensive to buy and use than other communications devices, like
cell phones, and can work better at short range. That was the
experience of Gary Eheman, a senior market support representative
stationed in Atlanta for International Business Machines, when he
attended an industry convention in Anaheim, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Although Eheman had a wireless phone and his co-workers had
pagers, he was thwarted when he tried to use his cell phone to call
a colleague from a basement conference room. That's when he thought
about how useful family radios would be.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at my cell phone and I can't get a signal. Why?
I'm below ground,'' he said. He switched to a set of Uniden 1400
radios _ a friend had purchased the pair for about $80 at a
warehouse buying club _ and reached a colleague on the 10th floor.
And there were no per-call charges.
</P>
<P>
   Away from work, Eheman and his son use the radios to stay in
touch while hiking. The range of the radios is generally advertised
as 2 miles, although atmospheric conditions, location and the type
of terrain can alter that range significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Another fan of the FRS radios is Paul Folmsbee, a real estate
agent with Block &AMP; Associates in Raleigh, N.C., who uses the radios
to talk to clients traveling in a separate car.
</P>
<P>
   ``Car to car, you get three-quarters of a mile,'' he said. ``Out
in the clear, you get about a mile and a half. Under exceptional
conditions, at the beach to someone out on the water, you'll get
the 2 miles.''
</P>
<P>
   Folmsbee also uses the radios at the mall with his wife. ``If I
want to go to Radio Shack and she wants to go to the shoe store, we
have a way to meet back up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under optimal conditions, the radios can far exceed the expected
range. Hobbyists in a short-distance radio Usenet group claim to
have transmitted 38 miles, from a Tennessee mountaintop to the
valley below, and others have claimed a distance of 58 miles,
transmitting mountaintop to mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   Since all models are limited by law to the same power output, a
half-watt, they differ primarily in the extra features they offer.
</P>
<P>
   A look at four 14-channel radios _ the Motorola T289 (a more
elaborate radio, the Motorola T6100, is not yet available), Kenwood
UBZ-LH14, Cobra FRS 310WX and Audiovox FR-314 _ show the range of
features available. In a test, all had good sound and range,
comfortably covering more than a mile in a downtown area.
</P>
<P>
   All the models offer the 38 squelch settings to block out
signals from other radios. That is becoming more important as the
airwaves become more crowded, especially in tourist locations. The
models can communicate with one another if they are set to the same
channel and same squelch setting.
</P>
<P>
   The family radios are like CB radios in that anyone who has one
can eavesdrop on a particular frequency. To make a conversation
more private, you need a scramble feature, which makes your signal
intelligible only to others with the same brand who have tuned
their radios to the same channel and turned on their descramblers.
That, of course, could still include listeners other than the ones
you intend to reach.
</P>
<P>
   Most family radios come with a keyboard lock, which turns off
all but the push-to-talk button and volume controls. That can keep
children from inadvertently changing channels, which could lead to
missed calls.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   On the Motorola, holding down the display light button for two
seconds disables the keyboard. That's so simple that it's easy to
shut down the keyboard accidentally.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, other units required a visit to the manual to set
the lock. On the Kenwood radio, the instructions read, ``With
transceiver power off, press and hold the mode key, then press the
power switch.'' That is difficult to remember, but it also makes it
hard to disable the keyboard by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Otherwise, the Motorola radio was the easiest to use without
consulting the manual. Ease of use and attractive cases have made
Motorola's models popular.
</P>
<P>
   A handy feature on the Cobra radio is the ``roger beep.'' When
the Send button is released, a beep tone is transmitted to the
other handset to let that person know when it is time to talk. That
is easier than saying, ``Over,'' or perhaps, ``Roger wilco,'' after
every transmission, which might be a thrill (or an embarrassment)
for the neophyte but in either case gets old very quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Cobra also has a more sophisticated call signal, which
alerts the other person _ or people _ that you want to talk. The
Cobra's signal is silent at the sending end, while the other radios
play a ringing tone at the sending end that is duplicated at the
receiver. The Audiovox radio offered a series of different tones,
including a song from the Popeye cartoon and ``shave and a haircut,
two bits.'' The Cobra can also be set to vibrate like a pager,
rather than ringing.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenwood radio is notable for its scanning feature, which can
be set to either find the busiest, or least busy, channel or a
clear channel. The Kenwood scanner can also search for signals from
a companion handset, although the Talk key on the other radio must
be depressed at the right moment. The process may require as much
coordination between users as does manually calling back and forth
until a clear channel is found.
</P>
<P>
   The Audiovox is the most compact of the four models, about a
half-inch smaller in width and height than the other radios but
just as powerful.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because of the careful limits on engineering that the
FCC has specified for these short-distance radios, there was no
clear difference in broadcast distance or clarity in the radios we
tested. Many features come down to personal preferences, like
whether to get models with rechargeable or single-use batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Rechargables are less expensive to use, and some would say more
environmentally friendly. The advantage of single-use batteries is
that you can buy more when you are at Disneyland and your power
runs low. The Cobra, Motorola and Audiovox can run on either power
source. The Kenwood uses only single-use batteries.
</P>
<P>
   Some models, including the Cobra and Kenwood, have fold-down
antennas, while some, including the Motorola and Audiovox, have
fixed antennas that are more rugged. The fold-away antennas make
the radios easier to pack, but the radios work best when their
delicate antennas are extended and vulnerable. The fixed antennas
are beefy enough to withstand everyday use.
</P>
<P>
   Walkie-talkie owners say they buy the units for security but
become hooked on them because they are fun. The Washington Area
Roller Skaters, which holds a group skating excursion that starts
near the White House several times a week, gives an FRS radio to
the lead skater, who picks the route, and the sweeper, who makes
sure that no one is hurt or left behind.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Clayton, a hair salon owner from Baltimore, makes it a
point to be the sweeper whenever she goes. ``You can volunteer to
sweep, and I like to so I can play with the walkie-talkie,'' she
said. ``It looks official.'' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Family radios are not the only two-way wireless devices. Here
are some others: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TOY WALKIE-TALKIES These toys, like those emblazoned with
Pokemon or Buzz Lightyear, have about the same broadcast power as a
garage door opener. The range may be 100 yards _ the front yard to
the back yard, provided the house isn't in between. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   COMMERCIAL WALKIE-TALKIES Often carried by construction workers,
these are usually General Mobile Radio Service devices. They have a
power output of one to five watts and a range of up to 5 miles for
portable units, more for base units. These devices can also be for
personal use. An $80 license is required. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CITIZENS' BAND RADIOS These are powerful, with a four-watt
transmitter of broadcast power, and no license is required. But
reception can vary greatly, depending on atmospheric conditions.
Under good conditions, CBs can broadcast several miles; under
exceptional conditions, the range can be 20 miles or more. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CELLULAR WALKIE-TALKIE SERVICE This is available through
wireless phone service providers like Nextel. The handset can be
used as a walkie-talkie, sending free calls to matching handsets.
No license is needed, but you need a phone-service contract. &QL;

`BURT LANCASTER': FROM ACROBAT TO ACTOR, EMBRACING RISKS ALL THE
WAY 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes appear at end of review.) By MEL GUSSOW   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The popular image of Burt Lancaster is that of a handsome,
abrasive tough guy, a former circus acrobat who tumbled through
action movies with an athletic grace. That Lancaster turns out to
be far more than that _ in fact, one of Hollywood's most versatile
stars and an actor with a conscience and an artistic sensibility _
is a tribute to Kate Buford, the author of ``Burt Lancaster: An
American Life.''
</P>
<P>
   Buford's illuminating biography is an almost complete portrait,
``almost complete,'' because Lancaster was, from all testimony, a
man who withheld himself emotionally. Buford quotes the director
Sydney Pollack as someone who ``knew and loved Lancaster as well as
anyone ever did, which is to say only partially.''
</P>
<P>
   Then looking back on a man he considered to be a mentor, Pollack
offers a clue to his character: ``He knew who he was, what he was
worth _ knew himself better than anyone I've ever met. So he was,
in a curious sense, fearless.'' Lancaster was, of course,
physically fearless, performing almost all his own stunts (as in
``Trapeze''). He was also daring in his acting choices, challenging
convention and the demands of stardom, sometimes stubbornly
choosing the most offbeat roles, like ``Birdman of Alcatraz.''
</P>
<P>
   As is pointed out in the book, his career was cumulative and
went through many changes, from his first riveting appearance on
screen in ``The Killers'' through his gangster-grown-old in
``Atlantic City,'' the capstone of what had been an extraordinary
career.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, the author corrects a few misapprehensions.
Lancaster was not always an imposing figure. Growing up in
Manhattan, he was small for his age, ``a short sissy,'' until he
suddenly grew tall at 13. His interest in acting began early, and
he had a long theatrical apprenticeship at the Union Settlement
House before he stepped on the professional stage. Eventually he
became something of a closet intellectual.
</P>
<P>
   He directed only one film, ``The Kentuckian,'' but with his
producing partners Harold Hecht and, later, James Hill, he was
responsible for many films (including ``Marty'') in which he did
not appear. He had a comprehensive knowledge of filmmaking and
aimed to be a perfectionist, in itself the source of some of his
clashes with directors.
</P>
<P>
   Interestingly, some of the people with whom he initially had
conflicts came to be his greatest admirers, foremost among them
Luchino Visconti. By talking back to the great Italian director,
Lancaster gained his respect. Nevertheless, Visconti called him
``the most perfectly mysterious man I ever met.'' That the actor
was underappreciated in ``The Leopard'' and many other films is
characteristic of his career. His biographer demonstrates how
shortsighted Hollywood, the public and critics could be, how quick
they were to pigeonhole him and how so many of his movies seem to
have improved with time. As Roddy McDowall observed, Lancaster had
the ability, rare in Hollywood, to ``discard what ... defined him
and change.''
</P>
<P>
   After briefly studying at New York University, he quit to join
the circus with his childhood friend Nick Cuccia. Cuccia became
Cravat and Lancaster shortened his name to Lang. As Lang and
Cravat, they polished their double act, which they were to
resurrect years later in ``The Crimson Pirate.'' Lancaster always
retained a measure of what his biographer calls ``the old circus
mountebank.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1945, on terminal leave from the Army and in uniform, he went
to visit his wife-to-be (his second wife) in the theatrical office
where she worked, and he was instantly discovered. In his Broadway
debut in ``A Sound of Hunting,'' he became the center of attention.
One movie talent scout reported that Lancaster, playing an Army
sergeant, had the ability to ``bounce off that stage'' with the
vitality of ``a mountain cat.'' That vitality quickly proved to be
transferable to movies. Cast in ``The Killers,'' he demonstrated
what the director Robert Wise called ``a gene for the screen.''
</P>
<P>
   The producer Hal Wallis initially wanted to change his name to
Stuart Chase, and at the beginning of his film career, Lancaster
rejected an offer to play Stanley Kowalski in the Broadway premiere
of ``A Streetcar Named Desire.'' No regrets: Lancaster thought he
had talent but not genius. Much later, however, he wanted to play
Don Corleone in ``The Godfather'' but lost out to Marlon Brando.
Another role that he wanted to play but didn't was the gay
hairdresser in ``Kiss of the Spider Woman.''
</P>
<P>
   One of many differences between him and Brando (and many other
film stars) is that Lancaster did not denigrate his profession. He
loved being an actor. As Buford says, acting offered him an
opportunity to try on ``different identities like an artist
shifting into different periods.'' Because of that quest, he
exhibited a much wider range than many of his peers and whenever
possible he made films with social content.
</P>
<P>
   Think of his characters: solitary gangster, self-mocking pirate,
hypocritical preacher, cowboys, con men, a depressed suburbanite
and an arrogant gossip columnist. At an older age, he played older
variations of the roles he had created.
</P>
<P>
   Marred only by an overly visceral writing style _ too many
references to Lancaster as a colossus, a golem and a volcano, as if
the author were reaching for a verbal equivalent of Lancaster in
action _ the biography puts the actor in perspective. Questions are
raised about his obsessive womanizing and his possible bisexuality,
his fear of flying (and even of swimming) and his temperamental
outbursts on set.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to those actors who thrive on ego and are vanquished
by failure, Lancaster was still working in his late 70s and
survived with his integrity intact. He acted in more than 70 films,
and a healthy percentage of them were of value. Wisely, he followed
his wife's advice to make one movie ``for the bank'' and one for
his art, thereby achieving an equilibrium.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster once said of the director Robert Aldrich and himself:
``We're all forgotten sooner or later. But not the films.'' He
concluded, ``That's all the memorial we should need or hope for.''
Lancaster's memorial is in, among other movies, ``From Here to
Eternity,'' ``Sweet Smell of Success,'' `Ulzana's Raid'' and
``Atlantic City.''

 &HT;    GROUP URGES MANDATORY HEARING TESTS FOR ALL NEWBORNS
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects congressman in first graf following optional trim.
 &HT;    420&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By ISMAIL TURAY Jr.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Newborns should receive mandatory hearing tests
from hospitals before they are taken home, a national group said
Wednesday as it released its state-by-state report card on newborn
hearing screenings.
</P>
<P>
   More than 12,000 babies are born deaf or with serious hearing
loss annually, and it sometimes takes parents up to two years to
find out, according to Hear Us: The National Campaign for Hearing
Health (NCHH).
</P>
<P>
   ``That's 22 babies who go home every day without being able to
hear their parents say 'I love you,''' said Elizabeth A. Foster,
campaign director of the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Tom and Laura Miller of Long Island, N.Y., are parents of two
hearing-impaired children. They told a forum hosted by NCHH that
they did not realize that their oldest daughter, Veronica, 5, was
deaf until she was 14 months old.
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, with mandatory testing at birth, Veronica would not
have any speech delays today,'' said a sobbing Tom Miller. ``With a
simple inexpensive test given at birth, you are not going to
eliminate hearing loss, but you can identify it and address it.
</P>
<P>
   Universal Newborn Hearing Screenings (UNHS), a system that tests
hearing abilities shortly after birth, costs as little as $20.
</P>
<P>
   But less than 35 percent of all newborns in the United States
are tested for hearing because hospitals are not required to
administer the test, and parents don't know that they should get
their children tested at birth, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   The group is launching a campaign, called May Babies, aimed at
increasing by 50 percent the number of newborns who are screened
for hearing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Hearing deficiencies can affect a child's cognitive, language
and academic development, said Dr. Eugene Sussman, a pediatrician
at Holy Cross in Maryland. But if detected early enough, he said,
steps can be taken to help the child.
</P>
<P>
   Only 24 states have adopted policies or mandates supporting
UNHS, according to the NCHH report card. Of those states, nine got
grades of excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Texas received a ``good'' rating, while Florida, Ohio and
Georgia were given grades of ``fair.'' Georgia and Texas have
enacted screening legislation, while bills are pending in Ohio and
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's legislation encourages, but does not mandate
screenings. Georgia screens 21 percent of babies born in the state
annually, while Florida screens 25.8 percent for hearing. Ohio
screens 17.3 percent of its newborns, and Texas screens 26.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Congress last November passed the Infant Hearing Screening Act,
sponsored by Rep. James Walsh, R-N.Y. The three-year law gives seed
money in the form of grants to states that want to set up their own
UNHS programs.
</P>
<P>
   States can apply for the grants through the federal Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention or the Health Resources Service
Administration. Both organizations were allocated $3.5 million
under the new law.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's give our kids the chance to hear the rush of a stream,
to hear the genius of Mozart or Wynton Marsalis,'' said Walsh, who
for nine years had been unsuccessful in his attempts to get the
legislation to pass in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can have all the research and all the legislation we want,
but it won't make a difference if parents don't get involved and
demand that their babies get tested,'' said Dr. Karl White,
director of the National Center for Hearing Assessment and
Management at Utah State University.
</P>
<P>
   More information about hearing screening can be obtained at the
National Campaign for Hearing Health Web site at
www.hearinghealth.net or at National Center for Hearing Assessment
and Management's site at www.infanthearing.org.

 &HT;    FLASHES BRIGHTER THAN A MILLION GALAXIES MYSTIFY ASTRONOMERS
 &HT;    Eds: Corrects univerity in graf 4 to ``Santa Cruz.''
 &HT;    750&AMP;add. For release Sunday, April 9.
 &HT;    Eds: Second in the occasional ``Window on the Universe'' series.
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For roughly 30 years, astronomers have known that
mysterious flashes of radiation are lighting up the distant
universe about 100 times a day, each with the energy of all the
stars of a million galaxies.
</P>
<P>
   During that time, more than 170 different explanations of what
is going on have been suggested. Nearly all of them have been
proved wrong, and Stan Woosley was the author of five of them.
</P>
<P>
   So, Woosley remains cautious about the growing popularity among
physicists of his sixth explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been wrong before,'' said the University of California,
Santa Cruz, astrophysicist, ``so I like to keep a certain amount of
skepticism, even about my own models.''
</P>
<P>
   In about three years, the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration plans to launch a ``low-budget'' $163 million
satellite called ``Swift'' to make the observations that could
finally determine whether Woosley's newest theory is correct.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is built around a scenario in which an extremely
large star abruptly collapses, then explodes in what astronomers
are calling a ``hypernova.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the cause of the bursts, astronomers agree they
represent the most violent explosions to occur since the ``Big
Bang,'' in which the universe is believed to have originated
billions of years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Radiation from a gamma ray burst taking place 5,000 light years
(or about 30,000 trillion miles) from the Earth would burn away the
ozone layer and wipe out life on the planet, some scientists
believe. That's not a likely prospect, since the bursts are
believed to occur only once every 10 million years in our entire
galaxy, which is 100,000 light years across.
</P>
<P>
   If a burst occurred at a distance of about 50,000 light years,
it would shine as brightly as the noonday sun for a minute or two,
then disappear forever.
</P>
<P>
   This fleeting nature of gamma ray bursts has frustrated
scientists for three decades.
</P>
<P>
   Some bursts last for a minute or two, others for a fraction of a
second. Like camera flashes you see from the corner of your eye,
then turn to find gone, the bursts fade rapidly from view and with
one notable exception, astronomers have never seen one.
</P>
<P>
   If it works as intended, the Swift satellite will detect a gamma
ray burst, then wheel about and focus its onboard telescopes on the
site while the event is still going on.
</P>
<P>
   Gamma ray bursts were first observed on July 2, 1967, said Neil
Gehrels, head of the gamma ray astrophysics branch of NASA's
Goddard Space Flight Center at Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Air Force ``Vela'' satellites had been placed in orbit to
monitor Soviet compliance with the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty by
watching for the high-energy gamma rays given off by nuclear
explosions. Soon, it became apparent that the satellites were
detecting gamma ray events that did not originate on the Earth's
surface.
</P>
<P>
   Since gamma rays from the bursts are absorbed by the atmosphere,
these phenomena had never been detected before.
</P>
<P>
   About two years later, satisfied the phenomena had no military
significance, Air Force officials revealed their existence,
creating overnight a new branch of astronomy and astrophysics and
setting in motion the three-decade search for an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Woosley said he has ``loved things that go kaboom'' since
childhood, when he used a toy chemistry set and a small tank of
propane to blow up a backyard shed. His gamma ray bursts, however,
are confined to the innards of a computer, which he used to make
complicated calculations describing the explosion of an star 30
times or more the size of the sun.
</P>
<P>
   He figured the explosion would send ``jets'' of matter racing
through space at 99.995 percent of the speed of light.
</P>
<P>
   When these jets collide with wispy-thin clouds of gas that
surround the exploded star, the gamma ray burst is created, Woosley
thinks. Because they are moving at a speed that is at the very edge
of scientific imagination, the particles within the jet collide
with the gas clouds and with each other with such awful force that
a beam of gamma rays, visible light and X-rays is propelled into
space in the direction of the jet.
</P>
<P>
   Only when the Earth lies in the path of the beam would it be
seen. The fact that the bursts are seen about once a day implies
that another 99 or so are happening but point away from this
planet, Woosley says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our model can explain the bursts that last around 20
seconds,'' Woosley said, ``but not the burst that lasts only
three-tenths of a second. We think that some other model, like
merging neutron stars, might explain those.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The collision of two neutron stars would amount to about the
biggest atom smasher imaginable. Both stars would be converted to
raw energy in a fraction of a second.
</P>
<P>
   But Bohdan Paczynski, a Princeton University astrophysicist who
proposed the merging neutron star model, says he has become
skeptical about all of the explanations, including his own.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a long chain of if-if-if and hypotheses and so on,''
he said, ``but observational evidence is limited. I am very cynical
about the models. I used to do this myself and it is difficult to
be very positive or very negative about any specific model.''
</P>
<P>
   What's needed, Paczynski said, is more observation.
</P>
<P>
   So far, astronomers have seen only a dim ``afterglow'' of gamma
ray bursts, and they believe these represent the supernova
explosions the jets left behind. Instruments aboard NASA's Compton
Gamma Ray Observatory, launched in 1991, have been detecting the
bursts for the past decade and locating them within general regions
of sky roughly as large as 1,600 full moons.
</P>
<P>
   By the time, astronomical telescopes can search such an area,
the burst has long faded.
</P>
<P>
   One gamma ray burst has been seen directly, and that was
achieved with the help of the Internet and the 800-millimeter lens
of a Canon telephoto camera like those use by ``paparazzi''
celebrity photographers.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists at Goddard, the University of Michigan, and the Los
Alamos and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories used an an
Internet link to monitor Compton detections of gamma ray burst
events. Four of the Canon cameras automatically aim at the spot
where the Compton detected the bursts and start clicking away.
</P>
<P>
   Because they are far less powerful than astronomical telescopes,
the Canons cover a much larger area of sky, and on Jan. 23, 1999,
one of them photographed a burst of visible light inside the area
where the Compton had detected gamma rays.
</P>
<P>
   The light grew increasingly brighter for several minutes, then
faded. Astronomers are convinced it was the visible portion of the
event that created the gamma ray signal. But it was little more
than a small dot that became a large dot before fading away
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   The event that caused the light appears to have happened 9
billion years ago, said Michigan physicist Carl Akerlof, director
of the project.
</P>
<P>
   Because of a failure of one of its guidance systems, NASA has
decided to ``de-orbit'' the Compton in the next few weeks in an
effort to avoid having it fall onto a populated area.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll be a sad moment for us,'' Akerlof said.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Swift satellite is in orbit, the observations will
continue.
</P>
<P>
   NASA astronomer Ann Parsons said gamma ray sensors on the
satellite will cover virtually the entire sky at all times. Small
blocks of lead will be scattered over the sensor panels in random
arrangements, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Since lead absorbs gamma rays, the blocks will throw gamma
``shadows'' on the sensor panels, and an onboard computer will uses
these shadows to calculate more precisely the location of the
bursts.
</P>
<P>
   The satellite will then evaluate this information to decide
whether to swing around and aim its visible light and X-ray
telescopes at the spot, Parsons said. Such considerations as
whether the maneuver would expose the spacecraft's telescopes to
ruinous rays from the sun will go into the computer's decision.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the 12 to 14 hours it now takes for close-up views of
the bursts, Swift will theoretically be able to start snapping
pictures within 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Astronomers can barely wait to get a look at those pictures.
</P>
<P>
   During a breakfast speech recently, Akerlof held up a bran
muffin to describe the enormous size of the event that caused the
flash recorded by his Canon cameras last year.
</P>

PRESIDENTS GET SHORT SHRIFT IN PBS SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Check local listings for time and channel.)  
 By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For a big, fat PBS series about a topic so important that the
program has a companion book, ``The American President'' feels
rather sparse.
</P>
<P>
   The series jams profiles of all 41 presidents into 10 hours,
over five consecutive nights. Figure the math, and that's why the
program doesn't seem bloated. By TV measure, each president is half
a sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   That's all right for some. William Henry Harrison took office on
March 4, 1841, and died on April 4, 1841. What can they say, that
most of his furniture arrived? But it's a squeeze to stay on
schedule with an Abraham Lincoln or a Franklin Delano Roosevelt.
FDR loved his work, signed a lot of bills, got elected four times,
and wham, gone.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the profiles are like a theme week speed read on A&AMP;E's
``Biography'' series, only a bit more serious.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by the father-and-sons team of Philip B. Kunhardt Jr.,
Philip B. Kunhardt III and Peter W. Kunhardt, ``The American
President'' isn't flashy.
</P>
<P>
   It's not lushly photographed or scored. It ventures few grand
pronouncements. The narrator, Hugh Sidey of Time magazine fame, is
serviceable but not rich of voice. It doesn't lend a sense of
pageantry to the nation's highest political office.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is there a profusion of on-camera historians. In fact,
there's one. He's Richard Neustadt of Harvard _ smiley,
bespectacled, bad teeth, good mind, pretty much down-to-earth.
</P>
<P>
   If you hang around, you might find yourself getting to like
Neustadt's modest observations about the presidents. The same is
true of the series itself. Don't expect brilliant illumination or
glitzy footwork, and ``The American President'' can grow on you.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, you won't learn what the Founding Fathers had in
mind for the presidency, but you do learn that ``Hail to the
Chief'' was first played for James Polk.
</P>
<P>
   The program's organization is problematic. Rather than starting
with George Washington and moving chronologically, it bunches the
presidents around one-hour themes.
</P>
<P>
   The first hour on Sunday, for example, looks at presidents who
reached office on the wave of family dynasties: John Quincy Adams,
son of John Adams; Benjamin Harrison, grandson of William Henry
Harrison; Franklin D. Roosevelt, cousin of Theodore Roosevelt; and
John F. Kennedy, son of the willful Joe Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   That's a curious and not altogether effective way to batch these
presidents. Sunday's second hour makes more sense. John Tyler,
Millard Fillmore, Andrew Johnson, Chester Arthur and Harry Truman
were some, but not all, of the ``accidental'' presidents _ vice
presidents under men who died in office.
</P>
<P>
   With these thematic batchings, some presidents seem hammered
into the wrong holes. Who wouldn't feel a little tug of remorse to
see that Abraham Lincoln turns up on Monday in a ``professional
politician'' category?
</P>
<P>
   (If you're wondering, Bill Clinton is the last president on the
last night, profiled with James Madison, James Polk and William
Howard Taft in a ``balance of power'' category. In Clinton's case,
it's about how 1990s partisanship strained the constitutional
balance of power.)
</P>
<P>
   The program provides voices for those presidents who didn't
leave audio recordings behind. Some of these are uneasy fits, too.
George Will's voice doesn't work with John Quincy Adams' visage. I
have heard Teddy Roosevelt's voice, and it didn't sound like
William F. Buckley. Others are ... interesting. Former Atlanta
Mayor Andrew Young voices Thomas Jefferson. Walter Cronkite is
George Washington. That one'll do.
</P>
<P>
   The presidents who speak for themselves include several
interviewed specifically for the series. Clinton and all the living
ex-presidents, except for Ronald Reagan, consented to on-camera
interviews. Clinton thanks the public for his ``second chance.''
Jimmy Carter credits his self-confidence and religious faith for
getting him through his disappointments.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the series makes clear is that unlike modern
presidential prospects, who practically drool to get elected,
plenty of presidents didn't want the job and were happy to leave
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel no regret that I was relieved of the thankless task of
running this government,'' Fillmore said after a presidency of
barely two years.
</P>
<P>
   And that from a man who never even had to figure out a
definitive position on Elian Gonzalez.

   NATIONAL FORECAST
</P>
<P>
   Jet stream winds moving quickly above the northern tier of
states will bring rapid weather changes to that region in the next
few days.
</P>
<P>
   Mild air will surge across the Ohio Valley into the Middle
Atlantic States on strong winds from the Southwest. Patchy clouds
will accompany the arrival of the milder air but sunshine will be
ample. Wind gusts over 30 miles an hour will be common as vigorous
low pressure moves east near the Canadian border. Clouds and a
broken area of rain and snow showers will occur in the chilly air
near the track of the low pressure center.
</P>
<P>
   A strengthening disturbance will produce intermittent snow over
the northern Rockies. In the wake of the low, blustery northerly
winds will deliver colder air to the region. Later Thursday night
and Friday as the storm center moves swiftly east, thundershowers
will develop in the central Mississippi Valley. Some snow will
whiten the eastern Dakotas and Minnesota.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: FIRE SEASON
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, residents of northern Virginia were alerted to a
heightened risk of wildfires Thursday. In much of the East, the
greatest risk from forest and brush fires typically occurs in
spring. Brush, leaves and grass deadened from winter provide fuel
for the fires. Also at this time, winds are relatively strong and
humidities are relatively low resulting in high evaporation rates
and fast drying. As a result, even after a period of spring rain,
the risk of fires can return within days.

 &HT;    N.C. HOUSE MEMBER ANGERED BY DELAY IN FLOOD AID
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A North Carolina lawmaker expressed frustration and
anger Wednesday that more than $300 million in hurricane relief for
the state is stalled in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is just absolutely ridiculous,'' said Rep. Bob Etheridge,
D-N.C. ``People living in trailers don't want to be there for a
second winter. ... They've been through hell. They don't want to
have to go through it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss., and other GOP
leaders this week indefinitely postponed action on a $12.6 billion
supplemental spending package for the current fiscal year that
includes the disaster relief.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republicans say the bill is bloated and that Congress
should deal with much of the spending, including flood relief, as
part of the normal appropriations process for fiscal 2001, which
begins Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no excuse for it,'' Etheridge said of the possible
delay. ``We are talking about American tax-paying citizens who've
lived by the rules and done the right things, and they don't
deserve to be treated this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The spending bill approved by the House, which more than doubled
President Clinton's request, includes $2.1 billion for peacekeeping
operations in Kosovo and $1.7 billion for drug intervention in
Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   The Colombia issue is particularly controversial, as critics
have expressed concerns about human rights violations and drug
trafficking by military and paramilitary groups fighting a civil
war there.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., said the problem with the spending
bill is not the money for drug interdiction or for U.S. troops in
Kosovo, but the millions in special projects that are not
emergencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm hoping that in the short term ... Senator Lott will go
ahead and move what is a true emergency,'' he said. ``Obviously,
the needs of North Carolina _ they are an emergency.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones also said he was confident that North Carolina's two
senators would work with the Senate leadership to secure the money.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lanier, an aide to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., said that Helms
would try to get the flood relief in the first spending bill to
move through Congress, whether that is a supplemental bill for
fiscal 2000 or a regular appropriations measure for fiscal 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Last fiscal year's first appropriations bill was signed into law
Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, language could be inserted to make the money
available as soon as the bill passes, he said. ``We don't want
people to have to wait until October,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's only a month or two longer but the truth is, that
matters,'' said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for Sen. John Edwards,
D-N.C. ``We need to get the money to the people who need it ... as
soon as we can.''
</P>
<P>
   The federal government has sent nearly $2 billion in disaster
aid to North Carolina, but much of it was delayed for weeks last
fall in a budget fight between Congress and the White House. In
addition, the state legislature has provided $836 million.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency spending package, which was approved by the House
last week, includes $81 million for tobacco farmers, $68 million
for home buyouts, $43 million for road repairs, $41 million for
rental housing and assistance, $12 million for a new Armed Forces
Reserve Center in Greenville, and $1.5 million for a U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers study on raising the dike on the Tar River in
the historic town of Princeville, in Edgecombe County.
</P>
<P>
   Etheridge said that Republicans could suffer politically if they
don't move the desperately needed hurricane aid.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as I'm concerned, it's in their camp and if they fail
to do it, I don't think there's any question about who held it
up,'' he said.

 A BROADWAY ORIGINAL: Writer-director Arthur Laurents hasn't
lost  any of his feisty spirit  
 By STEVEN WINN  
 c.2000, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK &LR;   &LR; _ The name might not register as quickly as Stephen
Sondheim, Ethel Merman, Barbra Streisand or Alfred Hitchcock, all
of whom he has worked with in over a half century on Broadway and
in Hollywood. But there's probably not a man or woman alive who
epitomizes the ebullient, feisty and pretension-skewering spirit of
20th century show business like the playwright and director Arthur
Laurents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost nothing on stage, screen or the printed page
that isn't too long,'' Laurents asserts with typical swagger,
``largely because of the notion that length equals importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurents wrote the classic books for ``West Side Story'' and
``Gypsy'' and the films ``Anastasia,'' ``The Way We Were'' and
Hitchcock's ``Rope.'' He directed the landmark gay musical ``La
Cage aux Folles.'' He was blacklisted in the 1950s and battered for
the infamous 1991 Broadway flop ``Nick and Nora,'' which he wrote
and directed.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at a very unbowed 82, he's published a bracingly frank
memoir, ``Original Story By'' (Knopf; $30), that pulls few punches.
</P>
<P>
   Greeting a visitor at his spacious Greenwich Village townhouse
one recent morning, Laurents looked as trim and almost as energetic
as a bantam weight prizefighter, a plum-colored ascot at his
throat. He was just back from a European ski vacation, followed by
a stint of London theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing worth seeing,'' he groused, his view made
uncontestable by the native Brooklyn burr in his voice.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions come easily and in unvarnished form for Laurents, both
on the page and in person. Unlike most showbiz autobiographies,
this one celebrates the joys of collaboration without blinking at
the flaws of his colleagues, friends and lovers. There was ``West
Side Story'' director Jerome Robbins' paranoia and composer Leonard
Bernstein's ego, ``Gypsy'' star Merman's obtuseness and his own
long struggle to embrace his homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Of today's musical theater, Laurents is equally blunt.
``Ragtime'' is ``god-awful. How many scenic styles can one show
have? I liked the first 10 minutes of `The Lion King.'''
</P>
<P>
   Laurents is dismayed by the current director-driven theater.
``They have this tendency to say, `How can I make it mine?' instead
of serving the intentions of the piece.'' And he bemoans the
dwindling of new American plays on Broadway (``There's no place for
them there anymore'') and the dearth of true theatrical producers.
</P>
<P>
   But Laurents is at heart an optimist, a doer. ``I think life's
terrific. There are plenty of people who would hit me for saying
it.'' His own creative plate is full _ with new plays, a musical he
is writing with his godson (and Richard Rodgers' grandson) Adam
Guettel and forth coming revivals of his McCarthyism play ``Jolson
Sings Again'' and others.
</P>
<P>
   His friend Stephen Sondheim's gloomy reflections in a recent
prominent interview nettled Laurents. ``It sounded whiny. He's had
too much success to complain. The theater (set ital)is(end ital) in
a bad place, but you don't quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Surrounded by engraved mementos of his hits and flops in a sunny
sitting room, Laurents can boil down success or failure to an
essence. ``West Side Story'' worked ``because it was done out of
innocence. We didn't think we were doing (set ital)art.''(end ital)
``Gypsy'' was written (with lyricist Sondheim and composer Jule
Styne) in three months, with no director or producer interference:
``It came from one viewpoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurents blames himself for attempting a ``Nick and Nora''
musical: ``It can't be done without William Powell and Myrna Loy. I
saw the story as a metaphor for dancing, and then I cast two people
(Barry Bostwick and Joanna Gleason) who couldn't dance. That wasn't
smart.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``La Cage,'' Laurents was convinced a 1983 Broadway
audience would never accept the gay love story if it were too
sexual. ``The gay community thought we pussyfooted, but they forget
this was the first time a man sang a love song to another man, held
his hand and kissed it.''
</P>
<P>
   Only in one area of his memoir, Laurents said, did he exercise
self-censorship: ``I didn't mention the names of any married
gays.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Original Story By'' is a jittery, jump-cut portrait of a life
devoted to the theater and the movies, with the joys of physical
love right up on the list. ``I think sex is absolutely primal. It
has always been a big part of my life, and it is today, at 82,''
said Laurents, whose book details some heady exploits with men in
his Army days and beyond, not to mention a fling with Lena Horne.
He also had a long-term relationship with film idol Farley Granger,
who starred in ``Rope.''
</P>
<P>
   Laurents met his longtime companion, Tom Hatcher, in the 1950s,
and he attributes much of his serenity to their life together. In
conversation, by contrast, serenity never suits Laurents for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you see Kevin Spacey (on `60 Minutes'),'' Laurents replied
impishly, when asked about his own exit from the closet. ``He went
on and said he wasn't gay. OK. Then he said he was 40. And you
don't believe anything he says.''

<P>
   Goga Vukmirovic heard a strange noise. It was a Monday morning,
April 6, 1992, the day of a dreaded biology test that the Sarajevo
seventh-grader had spent the entire weekend studying for furiously.
</P>
<P>
   She heard voices from outside her room, which made her pause,
because her parents were normally at work by the time she crawled
out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   Trodding tentatively into the living room, she saw her parents
gathered on the couch with her older sister Maja, watching scenes
on CNN _ scenes they had seen for weeks in Croatia, other places.
Not in Sarajevo. She sat on the couch and saw the war blowing apart
in her city.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your first instinct is hey, no school today!'' Ogjenka
Vukmirovic said ruefully, sitting in her dorm room at Princeton
University where she is a senior, captain of the nationally ranked
women's water polo team and known to everyone as Goga. ``But it
hits you pretty quick when the bombs start exploding that it may
not be such a good bargain.''
</P>
<P>
   Vukmirovic, now 21, never went back to school in Bosnia, never
went back to seventh-grade, or eighth-grade for that matter. After
fleeing from the war with her mother and sister, she enrolled as a
high school student in Venezuela. The next year she was at a
Connecticut boarding school to finish high school, where she was
introduced to the sport of water polo.
</P>
<P>
   Now she lives in a neat, white-walled room with typical college
decorations: post cards on the wall, shelves of academic books, a
poster of the rock group U2. But the books on the shelves are
mostly on the war in Bosnia, research for one of two senior theses
she is writing. She will point out the postcards that picture
places bombed and destroyed in the war, use her mouse to diagram
shelling trajectories on her screen saver of the mountains outside
of Sarajevo. Next to a box of computer disks sits a small clear
glass container, filled with bullets that she picked up from the
floor of her room in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that strange?'' she asked, smiling. ``It keeps you
motivated to write your thesis, Ill tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't seem as if Vukmirovic needs motivation. A founding
member of Princeton's varsity water polo team, which is 18-3 this
season, she was the 1999 Ivy League and Eastern Collegiate Athletic
Conference most valuable player, and a 1999 all-America goalie. She
is the only senior in the four-year-old program and was the most
valuable player in the ECAC championships which Princeton won last
weekend. The nationals are May 5-7 in Bloomington, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Women's water polo is an emerging collegiate sport. Thanks to
Vukmirovic's efforts, Princeton was ranked in the top 10 for the
first time in its history earlier this season and remains, after
traditional West Coast powers, a national contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's kind of a legendary kid here,'' said Bill Berghoff, her
high school coach at Choate Rosemary Hall in Wallingford, Conn.
``She'll come to visit a practice and she'll walk on the deck and
all these little high school girls will collect around her. She's
very embarrassed by it.'`
</P>
<P>
   At Choate, there is the ``Goga defense,'' where the goalie
glides out of the goal into the center of the pool to help defend,
the ``Goga save'' _ anything spectacular _ and the ``Goga cap,''
which she wore at Choate and is now ratty and falling apart.
</P>
<P>
   She does not talk with teammates about her experiences unless
somebody asks, but it is always there. In the mornings at Choate,
she would rush to check her e-mail messages, the only way she could
communicate with her parents. When an e-mail message wasn't there,
she wondered why, and would check compulsively until it came.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was actually my lifeline which helped me a lot in this
period of separation,'' Vukmirovic's mother, Svjetlana, said
recently in an e-mail message from Sarajevo, to which she returned
after her daughters went to the United States. ``The situation in
Sarajevo was so difficult in that time, that we were actually happy
not to have them with us in that hell.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been a series of missions for Vukmirovic, some seemingly
impossible. Lead a normal life without being able to hear or see
your parents for years, learn water polo, a sport she had never
seen until she started to play it. In Venezuela, where she lived
with her mother's family for 18 months, she attended school where
everything that was taught was in English and all she knew were
basic phrases. The first book she was assigned was ``Great
Expectations'' by Charles Dickens.
</P>
<P>
   But there was something to make her feel at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right as we went to Venezuela, they had a coup,'' she said.
``You saw all these people who are shocked that there are airplanes
flying over their homes and we were like, `oh, been there, done
that.' It's a sink-or-swim situation.''
</P>
<P>
   So she swam and followed her older sister to the United States
when a Choate representative visited her school. ``The progress as
a water polo player through her senior year was because she made it
a priority to learn,'' Berghoff said. ``When she commits to
something, she's just a hard driver. She does what she intends to
do. And she does it well.''
</P>
<P>
   After spending three years at Choate, Vukmirovic was accepted
into Harvard, Princeton, Yale and MIT. She chose Princeton because
she was offered an opportunity to work in a lab her freshman year
even though Princeton offered only a club water polo team.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the backbone of our team because you can always count on
the big save,'' Coach Luis Nicolao said. ``She has a very good
perspective on life, her priorities and the way she carries
herself. She's beyond her years.''
</P>
<P>
   Vukmirovic said that ``when you're not given a choice, you deal
with things much better because you can't second-guess yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can roll up and die and be depressed and sit in your room
all day, or you can figure out a way to go and deal with it,'' she
said. ``A lot of my papers and a lot of the work that I've done
relates to Bosnia. My thesis right now kind of brings a closure to
scattered years of thinking about some of these issues.''
</P>
<P>
   At first, Vukmirovic hoped that it would do more than provide a
personal closing. She considered returning to Bosnia after
graduation to try to implement her ideas for a truth commission to
promote ethnic reconciliation. She has since abandoned that idea,
stunned at the lack of support among her people, hurt that some now
view her as an international, someone too removed from the problem
to understand its solution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a typical Bosnian; I thought that I was,'` she said (her
father is Serbian, her mother Muslim). ``Even at Choate, I thought
my views on reconciliation were something that 99 percent of the
Bosnian population would agree with, but they're absolutely not.
I'm a huge minority view, which was completely discouraging and
disheartening.''
</P>
<P>
   So instead, Vukmirovic will live in New York, and work at the
private-equity group J.H. Whitney in Stamford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no econ background,'' she said, grinning. ``But I'm
very excited. It will be a challenge to me to learn it, to fit in.
This is going to be a sink or swim.''
</P>
<P>
   Been there. Done that.

   DOW-SIDE _ Where are the safe havens for nervous investors who
worry a lot in the kind of volatile markets we have today?
Blue-chips? Bonds? Gold? O rnone of the above. The best advice for

   AOL-BROWSER _ America Online Inc., the world's largest Internet
service, upgraded its Netscape Internet browser and said Gateway
Inc. will offer specialized Internet appliances featuring the
program. America Online said the new version, Netscape 6, is based
on open-source software, meaning programmers outside the company
can use the code it's based on to modify the browser. Such
contributions helped Netscape develop the underlying browser
program, called Netscape Gecko. America Online bought Netscape
Communications Corp. for $9.8 billion in March 1999. (Katz, Atlanta
Journl-Constitution). 16.

<P>
   COKE-STOCK _ Coke shares fell sharply on both short-term and
long-term concerns about the company's prospects. The dramatic
decline came only a day after Chairman Doug Daft and other
executives traveled to Wall Street to explain their strategy to
some 250 beverage analysts and money managers. But the company did
not get the buy-in it was hoping for. ``We expect investors to
restrain enthusiasm for KO until actual evidence of volume and
earnings growth acceleration begins to materialize,'' wrote analyst
Marc Cohen of Goldman, Sachs. (Unger, Atlanta
Journal-Constitution). 12.
</P>
<P>
   COKE-DISCRIMINATION _ A coalition of advocacy groups has offered
their support to organizers of a bus ``ride for justice'' against
Coca-Cola Co. to get the company to settle an employee racial
discrimination case quickly. The Coalition for the People's Agenda
_ which includes the NAACP in Georgia, Concerned Black Clergy, the
Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials, the Southern
Christian Leadership Conference, the Coalition of Black Women and
others, says it will also help raise funds to underwrite the costs

<P>
   Al Gore and George W. Bush, with the nominations already locked
up, coasted to two victories in two more states: Pennsylvania and
Wisconsin. But they weren't the only candidates on the ballot.
Pennsylvania Republicans (unofficial): Bush, 73 percent; John
McCain, 23 percent; Steve Forbes, 3 percent; Gary Bauer, 1 percent.
Pennsylvania Democrats (unofficial): Gore 74 percent; Bill Bradley,
21 percent; Lyndon LaRouche, 5 percent. Wisconsin Republicans
(unofficial): Bush, 69 percent; McCain, 18 percent; Alan Keyes, 10
percent; Forbes, 1 percent. Wisconsin Democrats (unofficial): Gore,
89 percent; Bradley, 9 percent; LaRouche, 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   HOME ON THE RANGE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush was taking the day off the campaign trail
Wednesday and turning to the business of governing Texas. And for
the first time, Bush's campaign team distributed a schedule of his
activities in Austin, Texas, to campaign reporters. The new
openness comes on the heels of recent press reports suggesting that
Bush doesn't work hard and may lack the stamina and drive for a
long campaign. ABC News reported that the governor was slated to
meet with staff and to sit through a series of campaign policy
briefings.
</P>
<P>
   BUT THEY'RE NICE PEOPLE THERE
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush claimed victory in Tuesday's Kansas primary with
thanks to all the voters who came out to support him. One problem:
The primary was canceled in February. ``Thank you Pennsylvania,
Wisconsin and Kansas,'' Bush said in a statement issued by his
campaign. Bush and Al Gore coasted to victories in the other two
states, but Kansas officials, citing a tight budget and lack of
relevance so late in the primary season, dropped their primary.
Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer blamed the press release on a
``goof.'' He said the writer had used a chart that hadn't been
updated.
</P>
<P>
   GIULIANI SUPPORT WANING
</P>
<P>
   Another poll is out showing a drop in support for Rudy Giuliani
_ in the wake of another fatal police shooting of an unarmed black
man. The Quinnipiac College poll (3 percentage point margin of
error) shows Giuliani's lead over Hillary Rodham Clinton in New
York's Senate race melted into a 46 percent to 43 percent edge for
Clinton. Polls released last week from Zogby International for the
New York Post and from Marist College's Institute for Public
Opinion had similar results. In the March 2 Quinnipiac poll,
Giuliani led Clinton 48 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   SICK FRIEND COMES FIRST
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore abruptly scuttled a campaign trip to North Carolina
Wednesday to visit a sick friend. He spoke Wednesday morning at an
AFL-CIO meeting in Washington and is still expected at an evening
fund-raiser in Maryland. But Gore was to have flown to Charlotte
Wednesday night for a visit today to a middle school. Spokeswoman
Laura Quinn said Gore wanted to keep the matter private. But she
said, ``This is not in any way related to any family member nor the
health of the vice president or Mrs. Gore; it has to do with the
health of a friend.'' Gore's schedule was to resume this evening in
Florida. The Charlotte school visit has been rescheduled for April
13.
</P>
<P>
   MAKING THEM HAPPY IN MASSACHUSETTS
</P>
<P>
   John McCain, who won all 37 of Massachusetts' Republican
delegates, has agreed with Gov. Paul Cellucci, a Republican, to
send seven supporters of George W. Bush to the national convention.
The Boston Globe reported that Cellucci and Lt. Gov. Jane Swift are
expected to be among them.
</P>
<P>
   BUCHANAN MAKES SOUTH DAKOTA BALLOT
</P>
<P>
   Partly because of petition signatures gathered by Pat Buchanan's
campaign, the Reform Party has earned a place on the South Dakota
ballot, the Buchanan camp announced Wednesday. The Reform Party of
South Dakota ballot slot, earned after 6,505 signatures were
submitted to the secretary of state, marks the first time Reform
has ever had its own ballot line in South Dakota. Buchanan workers
secured a place on the Utah ballot earlier this year. Ross Perot
ran in South Dakota as an independent in 1992 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
   THAT FREE SOIL MUST BE SHIFTING
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore made three different statements on Elian Gonzalez, and
it was not entirely clear what he had meant to convey. In short,
Gore said that the 6-year-old's father, Juan Miguel Gonzalez,
should get to take his son to Cuba if he makes the request ``on
free soil'' in the United States. A Wall Street Journal analysis
noted that ``Gore has taken different approaches on Elian Gonzalez
and the Microsoft antitrust case.''
</P>
<P>
   IT'S KLINK TO FACE SANTORUM
</P>
<P>
   Pennsylvania Democrats chose Ron Klink in a six-way battle to
challenge the re-election of freshman Republican Sen. Rick
Santorum. Klink received 41 percent; State Sen. Allyson Schwartz,
26 percent; and former state Labor Secretary Tom Foley, 25 percent.
Three other, lesser-known candidates split the rest. Santorum had
no Republican opposition.
</P>
<P>
   OLD RACIAL COMMENT QUICKLY RESURRECTED
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after state Rep. Terry Van Horne won the Democratic
nomination for a congressional seat in southwestern Pennsylvania,
Republicans began circulating news stories alleging he used a
racial slur six years ago. Soon after the results were announced,
the Republican National Congressional Committee sent reporters
copies of 1994 news stories that quoted Van Horne, who is white,
referring to a black lawmaker from Philadelphia. The remark, made
in a state Capitol hallway, was reported at the time in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. Van Horne said he was repeating what he
had heard others say when he was overheard by a reporter. Van Horne
and Republican state Sen. Melissa Hart are running for the seat
being vacated by four-term Democrat Ron Klink, now running for the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   RE-ELECTION IN MILWAUKEE
</P>
<P>
   Milwaukee Mayor John Norquist won a fourth four-year term,
defeating a downtown businessman, George Watts, who targeted
Norquist's record on crime, taxes and keeping jobs in the city. The
tally: 56 percent to 44 percent. Norquist ran upbeat ads showing
him jogging around Milwaukee streets and closing up drug houses
alongside police officers. Watts challenged Norquist's assertion
that crime in Milwaukee is going down, and called for the ouster of
the police chief.
</P>
<P>
   ELECTION GAMBLE PAYS OFF
</P>
<P>
   About 125 miles from Milwaukee, in the small town of Tomah, Ed
Thompson, the younger brother of Gov. Tommy Thompson, beat
incumbent Mayor Bud Johnson 1,179 to 909. ``I feel like I'm king of
the world,'' said Ed Thompson, 55, who has been a professional
poker player in Las Vegas, a prison cook, a snow plow driver, and a
boxer in ``Toughman'' contests. He said he decided to run for mayor
after his supper club, Mr. Ed's Tee Pee, was raided. Thompson
settled out of court and agreed not to operate video poker machines
for two years. The governor did not campaign in Tomah for his
brother.
</P>
<P>
   LOTT'S CHALLENGER SELECTED
</P>
<P>
   An ex-college administrator who ran an unsuccessful campaign for
lieutenant governor of Mississippi last year will take on Senate
Majority Leader Trent Lott in November. Troy Brown defeated farmer
Rickey Cole in the Democratic runoff. Lott, of course, is about as
unbeatable as it gets. In the only other Mississippi primary
runoff, accountant Randy McDonnell won the GOP's nomination for the
House 5th District race and will face incumbent Gene Taylor, a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   BIG SLAP IN LITTLE RHODY
</P>
<P>
   Party endorsements may not mean everything, but it was a slap to
second-term Democratic Rep. Robert Weygand when the Rhode Island
Democratic Party voted to give its endorsement for senator to
Weygand's opponent, Richard Licht, a former lieutenant governor.
Licht has been trailing Weygand in polls for the chance to take on
Republican Sen. Lincoln Chafee, who took over the seat last year
after the death of his father, John Chafee. Licht last held a state
office 12 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   WHAT MICROSOFT MAY NEED
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush, who has high-level backing from within Microsoft
Corp., is trying to steer clear of the software giant's legal woes.
In a bland statement issued when a federal judge declared Microsoft
an illegal monopoly, Bush said little more than that he would
``fully enforce antitrust laws.'' Back in February, though, Bush
had a lot more to say on a swing through Washington state,
Microsoft's homeland. ``I think the great fear is that Microsoft
will be broken up,'' he said, adding that he ``worried'' about the
consequences. Washington think-tank experts with opposing views on
what's best for the country, according to Cox Newspapers' Ken
Herman, think a Bush win in November is what's best for Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   MAKE THEM SHOW THEMSELVES
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lloyd Doggett (D-Texas) filed legislation aimed at forcing
nonprofits to disclose their donors. Several high-profile
Republicans have set up 527 organizations that rake in a lot of
money to aid their causes, but are exempt from having to disclose
the donors. Cox Newspapers' Jena Health reported that Doggett wants
groups such as Republicans for Clean Air, which ran ads attacking
John McCain days before the March 7 Super Tuesday primaries, to
have to disclose the names of the people who control these groups
and anyone who receives payments of more than $200. Under Doggett's
bill, failure to do so could cost the groups $100 a day and as much
as $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   STILL NECK-AND-NECK HORSE RACE
</P>
<P>
   Two new polls indicate that November is still a tossup. An ABC
News/Washington Post survey has George W. Bush leading Al Gore by
47 percent to 45 percent, while a CNN/USA Today/Gallup survey has
Gore leading Bush 45 percent to 44 percent. Both polls were
conducted March 30-April 2 and have a margin of error of plus or

   LAZIO WILL HAVE TO WARM THE BENCH
</P>
<P>
   New York GOP chief William Powers says he's found no support for
a possible Senate run by Rep. Rick Lazio as an alternative to Rudy
Giuliani. ``I've taken the pulse of the party and there is nothing
there for Rick Lazio,'' Powers said. But Lazio said that ``a
handful'' of local county chairmen ``have called and pledged their
support, so I know he's not speaking for all county chairmen.''
Several days ago, Lazio said the party might be ``blowing'' the
Senate race against Hillary Rodham Clinton by lining up behind
Giuliani, and that he, Lazio, was ready to run if the party wanted
him.
</P>
<P>
   FOR WYLY, ADVERTISING DIDN'T PAY
</P>
<P>
   That wealthy Texan who spent $2.5 million on ads backing George
W. Bush said he's getting out of political advertising. Sam Wyly
stirred the presidential campaign last month with the Republicans
for Clean Air ads. Broadcast in New York, Ohio and California, the
ads praised Bush's environmental record and attacked John McCain.
But in a speech in Seattle, Wyly said the ads were not effective in
publicizing his message about environmentally friendly power and
that he would not be making any more. The ads also apparently were
not effective in promoting Wyly's company, GreenMountain.com, which
sells renewable energy in states that have deregulated to allow
competition.
</P>
<P>
   DIVIDED LOYALTIES
</P>
<P>
   Florida Republicans are torn between Rep. Bill McCollum and
Education Commissioner Tom Gallagher, who are seeking the party's
U.S. Senate nomination. Gallagher is viewed ``as more moderate,''
while McCollum ``has been a champion of conservative causes,''
according to the Tampa Tribune. Former party Chairman Tom Slade
told the newspaper: ``The problem people are having with this race
is that it is the closest thing to a mathematical split I've ever
seen in how it's divided up Republican loyalists in Florida. ...
And they feel pretty passionate about it, so if you take sides,
you're going to tick off half the loyalists.''
</P>
<P>
   SO SHARP SOMEONE COULD GET CUT
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore says his campaign against George W. Bush presents voters
with ``as stark and clear and sharp a contrast as in any election
in American history.'' In a speech to party donors in Glen Cove,
N.Y., he criticized Bush's policies and said this period in time
could be described as a ``mountaintop moment.''
</P>
<P>
   At a time of continued economic growth, Gore said the country
must ask itself ``not only how do we keep this prosperity going,
but how do we make sure that nobody is left behind?''

U.S. CITIZEN ARRESTED AS SPY IN RUSSIA  
</HEADLINE>
   By CELESTINE BOHLEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russian security agents arrested an unidentified U.S.
citizen and an alleged Russian accomplice on spying charges
Wednesday, and were holding both men in Moscow's Lefortovo Prison.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, the Russian domestic security agency accused the
American, described as the head of a private firm, of having
``deliberately established contacts over a long period with Russian
scientists'' in order to obtain state secrets. The Russian, also
unidentified, was described as a specialist working in the Russian
defense industry.
</P>
<P>
   A Russian TV news report Wednesday night said that both men
would be charged Thursday, when their names will probably be
released.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy here refused to comment on the case, but in
Washington Wednesday the State Department's spokesman, James P.
Rubin, said a U.S. consular officer had visited the American and
described him as being in good health and hopeful of resolving the
matter soon.
</P>
<P>
   But without diplomatic immunity, the American could face a jail
sentence of 10 years to 20 years on espionage charges, a Russian
news agency reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's arrests are among a series of Cold War-style spy
spats between Russia and western nations in recent months, and come
at a time when President-elect Vladimir Putin is trying to reassess
Russia's relations with the West.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, a U.S. diplomat, Cheri Leberknight, was arrested
and accused of spying after Russian agents said they had caught her
on her way to meet a Russian contact in a Moscow park. Both
Leberknight and the contents of her handbag were shown on Russian
television, in an unusually public display of a case that would
have typically been handled secretively.
</P>
<P>
   Leberknight was quickly released and soon left the country.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after that, U.S. agents in Washington caught a Russian
diplomat who was allegedly monitoring a microphone that had been
planted in a conference room on the executive floor of the State
Department.
</P>
<P>
   And last month, the Russians said they had uncovered a Russian
citizen who had been passing on reports _ including some about
Putin's presidential campaign _ to the British Embassy in Estonia.
In Poland, the Warsaw government earlier this year expelled several
Russian diplomats on espionage charges.
</P>
<P>
   In its statement Wednesday, the Federal Security Service, which
is the heir to the Soviet-era KGB, said that a large quantity of
incriminating documents had been found on the U.S. citizen and that
the Russian citizen was carrying large quantities of foreign
currency.
</P>
<P>
   In a news broadcast Wednesday night, NTV television said that
$30,000 had been found on the Russian, while diagrams and plans for
Russia's latest submarine missiles had been discovered in the
American's office. According to the news report, the Russian was
arrested on the street after he left the American's office.

<P>
   The election of Putin, himself a former KGB officer who served
for five years in East Germany, has given renewed confidence to
Russia's security services, which now seem less hesitant to use
their authority. The FSB has recently accused foreign intelligence
services of stepping up their activities in Russia, and claimed to
have intervened against 65 foreign spies in 1999 and to have
intercepted 30 Russian citizens from selling state secrets.
</P>
<P>
   This latest spy case also comes as the Russian government goes
on the defensive against accusations of serious human rights
violations committed by Russian troops in Chechnya, which are this
week being discussed in various international forums, including the
parliamentary assembly of the Council of Europe.

   Spills Are Not a Problem For a Flexible Keyboard  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is generally considered a bad idea to clean your computer
keyboard by holding it under running water. But then, it is also a
bad idea to spill tabouleh salad between the keys, and thousands of
people do that every day.
</P>
<P>
   The Flexboard is a keyboard that you cannot only wash but also
hang out to dry. The flexible, rubber-covered keyboard resembles a
no-slip bathmat, and its sealed surface can withstand any number of
spills. You can clean it, disinfect it (with bleach, if you wish),
then simply roll it up and put it aside.
</P>
<P>
   The Flexboard has been available in Europe for a couple of years
_ about 50,000 units have been sold there _ and it is now being
distributed in the United States. The touch of the Flexboard is
closer to that of an electric typewriter than the average computer
keyboard, so typing on the Flexboard requires a little more elbow
grease.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I were going to write a doctoral thesis, it's not the
keyboard I would necessarily use,'' said Ken Corsun, president of
Man &AMP; Machine (www.mmits.com), which is distributing the Flexboard
in the eastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   The basic model sells for $99; an industrial model, which can
withstand harsher chemicals, is priced at $229. Corsun said
potential customers would include restaurants, hospitals and places
with children, like schools and day care centers. ``Peanut butter
and jelly won't damage it,'' he said. ``And as far as I can tell,
they can't break it.''

   For Dreamcast Players, A Network of Their Own &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Dreamcast devotees will have their own network this fall, and
Sega is offering some heady incentives, including cash and
Dreamcast consoles, to attract them.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Sega Enterprises announced the creation of Sega.com,
a company devoted to online interactive entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to developing new games, Sega.com will offer
SegaNet, a private network devoted to high-speed console gaming.
SegaNet is expected to give game fanatics plenty of the things they
crave, like online 3-D multiplayer games, industry news, instant
messaging, game downloads, tournaments and cheat codes.
</P>
<P>
   SegaNet will also function as an Internet service provider. The
network will also cater to the other interests of its target market
of young males, including tie-ins with movies, sports and music.
SegaNet is expected to cost $21.95 per month, which is comparable
to the monthly fees of other Internet providers, and users can sign
up for the service at www.sega.com.
</P>
<P>
   Although no incentives may be needed for some Dreamcast fans,
Sega.com is dangling an attractive rebate offer to those who sign
up for the SegaNet service, which is scheduled to start in early
September. New subscribers who own a Dreamcast machine will receive
a check for $200 from Sega and a keyboard. PC owners who sign up
will get a Dreamcast console and keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   The Dreamcast console, two million of which have been sold since
the fall, hooks into the user's television and has a built-in
modem. The company is making adapters that will support both
Ethernet and broadband connections.
</P>
<P>
   By creating its own network of people using the same hardware,
Sega.com hopes to quell the common complaints of online gamers,
mainly slow response time due to Internet traffic and hardware
incompatibility. That should allow users to bond, brag and blow one
another off the screen faster than ever. J.D. Biersdorfer &QL;

   Backflip Lets Web Users Store and Share Bookmarks &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A new service from Backflip, based in San Francisco, offers Web
users who have obscure interests a chance to create Internet
directories that reflect their personal obsessions.
</P>
<P>
   Backflip is one of several companies that allow users to store
their Web browser bookmarks or favorites list on the company's Web
site (www.backflip.com) rather than on their _ or perhaps more to
the point, their employers' _ hard drives.
</P>
<P>
   With its recently introduced feature, called Show and Tell,
users can create folders of links on a specific topic and attach a
series of e-mail addresses. People on that list automatically
receive messages telling of any updates to the mini-directory.
Everyone invited to view the directory can contribute additional
links or post comments. ``Our users are building up a huge
collection of wisdom,'' said Tim Hickman, Backflip's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   Hickman said the free service would probably be of interest to
users like teachers, students and book clubs, but he said not all
the wisdom being gathered was of the ages. He said the service had
also been used to help plan weddings and to coordinate house
hunting between a couple and their real estate agent. &QL;

   RECYCLING COMPUTERS Don't know what to do with the 1988
Macintosh Plus? You aren't alone. According to estimates from the
Clean Computer Campaign, a project of the Silicon Valley Toxics
Coalition, more than 12 million computers became obsolete last year
and only a fraction of those ended up in landfills. Three-quarters
are still sitting in basements and garages.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition also surveyed 21 major computer manufacturers to
determine their environmental policies for old products, including
policies on hazardous waste and on taking back used machines. At
the top of the environmental group's list were Apple and IBM, and
toward the bottom were Packard-Bell/NEC, Unisys (the only company
that filled out the coalition's questionnaire) and Hitachi. The
1999 environmental scorecard is at
www.svtc.org/cleancc/99reportcard.htm.  &QL;

   Pentax Digital Camera Has Built-In Computer  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Pentax VersaCam doesn't have a viewfinder and it doesn't run
on batteries. But it does have one feature not commonly found on
digital cameras: its very own personal computer.
</P>
<P>
   The VersaCam's built-in PC and its laptop-style slot for modems
or network cards allow it to take snapshots, convert them to the
common JPEG Internet file format and _ without any human
intervention or extra equipment _ post them on a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   ``It probably doesn't fall into the digital camera
classification,'' said Jeffrey McAlister, the camera's program
manager at Pentax Technologies. ``It's more an Internet camera.''
</P>
<P>
   McAlister said the boxy camera, which must be plugged into an
electrical outlet, is designed to be used for tasks like security
surveillance. To frame the camera's view and focus its lens, users
must plug in a monitor. A cable connection to a PC is also required
to set the duration and frequency of the camera's photo sessions
and specify the Web site where its images are to be displayed.
</P>
<P>
   In its current form, the $899 VersaCam is palm size. McAlister
said the next model will probably have a viewfinder and be
battery-powered. If so, when combined with a wireless modem card,
it could create a new way for tourists to pester the folks back
home with their vacation photos. &QL;

   Retracing an Ill-Fated Shackleton Expedition &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sir Ernest Shackleton's great renown as an explorer is not based
on what he discovered, but on what he survived. The captain of the
British ship Endurance set out in 1914 to become the first man to
cross the Antarctic continent. Four months after the Endurance was
caught and crushed in ice, Shackleton and five crewmen set out in a
22-foot boat, hoping to reach a whaling station on South Georgia
island, some 800 miles away. Remarkably, their attempt was
successful and the rest of Shackleton's crew was rescued 22 months
after their expedition began. PBS/Nova Online
(www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/shackleton) will follow three modern
mountaineers as they retrace Shackleton's steps across the glacier
peaks of South Georgia. Online dispatches will include audio from
the climbers themselves, digital maps and, weather permitting,
360-degree panoramas from the peaks.
</P>
<P>
   The site also features visits to other scenes of the Shackleton
voyage, illustrated by stunning still pictures and film captured by
Endurance photographer Frank Hurley. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ The Equator Mini-Maid dishwasher is small enough to
sit on a countertop. Though it is bigger than a breadbox (if square
in shape), it is as portable as a microwave or a 13-inch
television. The modest size might make it the renter's solution to
dishpan hands.
</P>
<P>
   The dishwasher, about 19} inches on each side, can also be
mounted in a cabinet as a miniature version of the high-end
dishwasher drawer. The Mini-Maid's two models are not for scrubbing
big pots or cookie sheets.
</P>
<P>
   The PLS 602 S (about $370) has four wash-cycle settings and may
hold as many as eight full place settings.
</P>
<P>
   The PLS 600 (just introduced at $300), is a party giver's dream:
it is designed for glassware, especially martini glasses.
</P>
<P>
   The same company also offers space-saving appliances for
clothes. The EZ 3,600 CEE (about $900) is one of its ``clothes
processors,'' which combine a washer and a dryer in one unit, a
combination long popular in Europe. Because the combination clothes
washers and dryers are ventless, they can be installed under a
kitchen counter.
</P>
<P>
   This one can do a few shirts, two or three pairs of jeans,
perhaps the contents of one pillow case. The total time for washing
and drying can be two hours, but it is faster than hand washing and
air drying, without the need to drape laundry on a shower rod.
</P>
<P>
   Both appliances can be hard to find in stores. Information is
available from Equator at (800) 935-1955 or from the company's Web
site, www.equatorappl.com.

   LOS ANGELES AND MIAMI _ The day-trading clients hanging on the
telephone at the Charles Schwab brokerage house were begging for
mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't tell my husband I've just lost $50,000,'' one
woman sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers were calling to tell the private investors hunched
over their home computers that it was time to settle their
positions and cut their losses before they became any bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts involved were not monstrous _ most day traders do
not hold on to much stock for very long _ but still big enough in
some cases to warrant second mortgages, sell-offs of assets,
cancellations of Caribbean vacations.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of Los Angeles, where for months home-based
investors have reaped the stock market whirlwind and contributed to
a furious boom in house prices and trendy new restaurant openings,
the sobriety of the moment was sinking in fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm down 20 percent, what can I tell you?'' said day trader
Lorraine Conn, who missed part of the big slide in prices over the
past few days because she was sunning herself on a beach in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a bust moment for e-tailers and e-commerce
companies, but the big backbone companies like Cisco will bounce
back. We're seeing a lot of margin selling but I think the market
will hit bottom pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Mathison, a spokesman for Charles Schwab, acknowledged
there had been ``some level of dizziness'' but said most of his
company's clients were level-headed enough to take a long-term view
and not give themselves over to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a busy day,'' he said. ``But we haven't seen a big
volume of requests for help. We try to encourage people not to
overreact to short-term fluctuations in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That did not mean the atmosphere was any less than frantic in
the homes of day traders or at securities brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Most at risk were the short-term individual investors who had
bought up batches of a few hundred shares in hi-tech stocks on the
Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   When the index plummeted, as it did on Monday and again Tuesday,
those stocks reached a value so low that the difference in purchase
price and current selling price exceeded the credit limit those
investors had with their brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers then ``called in the margins'' _ a polite way of
saying that they were collecting their debts by forcing their
customers to sell, triggering automatic losses running into the
tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   One investment fund noted that day traders were getting ``blown
out'' of the market in this way.
</P>
<P>
   In homes and offices, phones were ringing constantly, with many
callers forced to call back four or five times as lines constantly
cut off without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call back when the markets have closed?'' asked a
harried Michael Strahan of Round Hills Securities in Los Angeles,
before offering the tentative view that the market, in the
``semi-long-term,'' would hit a ``semi-bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet online chat rooms where the New Economy stock
boom started, there was a frenzied mixture of elation, despair and
greed as stocks plunged down, then caught their breath again.
</P>
<P>
   Many _ if not most _ were as gung-ho as ever, in the
relentlessly optimistic atmosphere that characterizes the world of
cyber-trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really wish I had more money to throw at the market now...
great leverage opps,'' said Mercury in the Daytraders chat room.
``Covered all my short positions _ first time ever,'' said Segman,
who was being more cautious. ``Alot of houses going to market this
month,'' said DayRaider.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these people? Senior citizens day-trading from their
Boca Raton condominiums? The independently wealthy who became
dot.com millionaires on the tech-stock boom? Or the taxi-drivers,
concierges, cleaners and busboys who have been sucked into the
vortex of the stock-market boom?
</P>
<P>
   They went on: ``Oh, this is going to be a NIIIIIIIIIIICE ride,''
said NDennis0249 in the peculiar grammar-free rhetoric of the chat
room. Racecar called it ``CHARCOAL TUESDAY!'' while CDN was looking
on the bright side: ``Tomorrow the markets ROAR back as everyone
senses a bargain!'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700, OR CONTINUE TO 850) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   ``So so mad no more money to trade,'' said Mercury, still
desperately seeking bargains. ``This is a buy of the year
opportunity right this instant.'' It was 1:23 p.m. Eastern Time;
the Dow was down 210.7, the Nasdaq down 430.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys think this is fun?'' said Node, who apparently had
little time for the fiddling while the Nasdaq burned. ``This is
CRASH!... We beat 1987 CRASH today!''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, market commentators were complaining
vociferously about ``panic buying'' in the technology sector. That
was all a dim memory Tuesday as people watched the initial collapse
in shocked disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a body in motion,'' commented Arthur Hogan, the chief
market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``There is really no floor for
this. It's impossible to stop this until they ring the bell.'' &QL;

   When the index plummeted, as it did on Monday and again Tuesday,
those stocks reached a value so low that the difference in purchase
price and current selling price exceeded the credit limit those
investors had with their brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers then ``called in the margins'' _ a polite way of
saying that they were collecting their debts by forcing their
customers to sell, triggering automatic losses running into the
tens of thousands.
</P>
<P>
   One investment fund noted that day traders were getting ``blown
out'' of the market in this way.
</P>
<P>
   In homes and offices, phones were ringing constantly, with many
callers forced to call back four or five times as lines constantly
cut off without warning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can you call back when the markets have closed?'' asked a
harried Michael Strahan of Round Hills Securities in Los Angeles,
before offering the tentative view that the market, in the
``semi-long-term,'' would hit a ``semi-bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Internet online chat rooms where the New Economy stock
boom started, there was a frenzied mixture of elation, despair and
greed as stocks plunged down, then caught their breath again.
</P>
<P>
   Many _ if not most _ were as gung-ho as ever, in the
relentlessly optimistic atmosphere that characterizes the world of
cyber-trading.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really wish I had more money to throw at the market now...
great leverage opps,'' said Mercury in the Daytraders chat room.
``Covered all my short positions _ first time ever,'' said Segman,
who was being more cautious. ``Alot of houses going to market this
month,'' said DayRaider.
</P>
<P>
   Who were these people? Senior citizens day-trading from their
Boca Raton condominiums? The independently wealthy who became
dot.com millionaires on the tech-stock boom? Or the taxi-drivers,
concierges, cleaners and busboys who have been sucked into the
vortex of the stock-market boom?
</P>
<P>
   They went on: ``Oh, this is going to be a NIIIIIIIIIIICE ride,''
said NDennis0249 in the peculiar grammar-free rhetoric of the chat
room. Racecar called it ``CHARCOAL TUESDAY!'' while CDN was looking
on the bright side: ``Tomorrow the markets ROAR back as everyone
senses a bargain!'' &QL; 
 &LR;  &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
    &UR; (STORY CAN END HERE AT 700, OR CONTINUE TO 850) &LR;  &QC; 
</ANNOTATION>
 &LR;  &QL;
<P>
   ``So so mad no more money to trade,'' said Mercury, still
desperately seeking bargains. ``This is a buy of the year
opportunity right this instant.'' It was 1:23 p.m. Eastern Time;
the Dow was down 210.7, the Nasdaq down 430.8.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys think this is fun?'' said Node, who apparently had
little time for the fiddling while the Nasdaq burned. ``This is
CRASH!... We beat 1987 CRASH today!''
</P>
<P>
   Only a few weeks ago, market commentators were complaining
vociferously about ``panic buying'' in the technology sector. That
was all a dim memory Tuesday as people watched the initial collapse
in shocked disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a body in motion,'' commented Arthur Hogan, the chief
market analyst at Jefferies &AMP; Co. ``There is really no floor for
this. It's impossible to stop this until they ring the bell.'' &QL;

VIRTUAL GARAGE SALES, WITH NO HAGGLING
</HEADLINE>
 By MICHELLE SLATALLA  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I heard about a new online site called Half.com, where you
can buy and sell used books, software and music CDs for up to half
their list prices, my initial reaction was fear. Here, I figured,
was another gimmicky site that would turn out to be sort of like
eBay, but not really, and might be fun to use once, but only if you
have a lot of time on your hands.
</P>
<P>
   I do not have a lot of time on my hands. So Half.com's promise
that I could make money selling my dusty, paperback copies of ``The
Armies of the Night'' and my Billy Joel CDs did not appeal to me.
Nor do I have a high tolerance for the busywork of packing and
standing in line at the post office. Last winter, it took me two
weeks to sell a $12 vase for $8 on eBay, and then I had to spend
almost $3 on bubble wrap. I wasn't eager to try again.
</P>
<P>
   So it is fair to say that no one at the post office one morning
last week was more surprised than me to realize that I was the
person in line who was humming contentedly. (Well, maybe the tall
clerk with the glasses, the one I yelled at last Christmas for
dawdling over a customer's money order _ Must we indulge in
chitchat when there's a long line? _ was more shocked. He gave me
one of those cautious, wan smiles frequently directed at people one
hopes have finally filled their mind-calming prescriptions.)
</P>
<P>
   Drugs would probably have been a more obvious explanation for my
cheeriness than the truth: I was waiting to mail a copy of the
``Portnoy's Complaint'' that I had sold for 50 cents through
Half.com to a woman in Oklahoma. I felt as though the Internet had
helped me beat the system again.
</P>
<P>
   The system I am referring to this time is the one that decreed
that the only way to get rid of used items was to set up a rickety
card table on the front lawn, call it a garage sale and watch your
neighbors paw disdainfully through your personal inventory, then
paw through it again that evening after you have left all the
unsold stuff on the curb.
</P>
<P>
   Half.com (www.half.com) has managed to create a new system, a
hybrid that mingles the best aspects of online auction sites like
eBay and online retailers like Amazon. Here's how it works. Like
eBay, Half.com functions like a big open marketplace where sellers
can get rid of used merchandise. But unlike sellers at eBay,
Half.com's sellers list their items for a fixed price (which can be
no more than half of the manufacturer's list price) and buyers do
not bid against one another.
</P>
<P>
   Auction houses are premised on the notion of scarcity, said
Joshua Kopelman, Half.com's chief executive. ``But we're
different,'' he said. ``We offer mass-produced or commodity items,
so there's no reason to bid. It's like when I go to the Gap.
There's no reason to bid on khakis.''
</P>
<P>
   As of last week, the site had 2.35 million listings, of which
2.16 million were books. To ensure standardized pricing, Half.com
limits listings to the 8 million or so items that carry either an
International Standard Book Number, which Kopelman said had been
issued to most books published since 1968, or a Universal Product
Code, issued to all CDs and videos.
</P>
<P>
   All I had to do to list an old murder mystery called ``The
Sirens Sang of Murder'' on Half.com was to type in the book's ISBN,
printed on the cover. Then Half.com informed me that the book had
been published in 1990, that its list price was $5.99 and that I
could sell it for up to half that amount. If the book had such
defects as rips, creased pages or notes in the margin, Half.com
recommended asking for less. Using the site's comparison-shopping
feature, which automatically popped up on the listing page, I could
see that at least six online booksellers offered new copies of the
same book at prices ranging from $4.50 to $5.39.
</P>
<P>
   It is a pretty good deal for the buyer, too. Under the old
garage-sale system, the buyer of my old mystery novel might have
wandered around at garage sales and used bookstores for 10 years
before she found this book. Now she could read it, then turn right
around and sell it again _ for $2.02, the same price that she had
paid _ on Half.com.
</P>
<P>
   One drawback is that you may not be able to unload all your
garage-sale-worthy books. If, like me, you possess an ISBN-less
copy of the Gesell Institute's ``Child Behavior,'' originally
published in 1955, you will not be able to sell it on Half.com. It
seems a shame, really, to deprive readers of the opportunity to
possess a copy of a book that once sold more than 1 million copies
and that, according to its cover, was considered by PTA Magazine to
be a milestone in education.
</P>
<P>
   But where Half.com really excels is as an intermediary between
buyer and seller. Half.com processes all payments (which are
charged to a buyer's credit card after a seller confirms plans to
ship) and sends a check once a month to the seller for all
merchandise sold during that period, minus a 15 percent commission.
</P>
<P>
   If a buyer complains that an item never arrived or was
misrepresented, Half.com puts the money on hold and investigates.
If an item is unsatisfactory, a buyer returns it to Half.com, not
to the seller, and the site refunds the money. (``This is a very
rare occurrence,'' Kopelman said.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition to that 15 percent commission, Half.com makes money
by charging the buyer more for shipping than it actually costs. For
instance, the actual cost to mail ``The Sirens Sang of Murder'' was
$1.13. Half.com will reimburse me, the seller, $1.50 for shipping
to subsidize the cost of packing materials but will charge the
seller $1.95, still a lot cheaper than the $3.99 a buyer would have
to pay to Amazon for shipping.
</P>
<P>
   After I returned from the post office, I bought used copies of
three recently published books (including a hardcover copy of ``A
Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius,'' which was not in stock
at my local bookstore) on Half.com for $44.59. That was a savings
of more than $10 over the cost of buying the same discounted books
new from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   The thing that took the longest to accomplish on Half.com?
Making a wish list. I typed the names of about a dozen recently
published books that I wanted. If a seller lists any of them,
Half.com will notify me via e-mail. Then I listed six more books
for sale. That clerk at the post office is going to be seeing a lot
more of me.

   LOS ANGELES AND MIAMI _ The day-trading clients hanging on the
telephone at the Charles Schwab brokerage house were begging for
mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Please don't tell my husband I've just lost $50,000,'' one
woman sobbed.
</P>
<P>
   The brokers were calling to tell the private investors hunched
over their home computers that it was time to settle their
positions and cut their losses before they became any bigger.
</P>
<P>
   The amounts involved were not monstrous _ most day traders do
not hold on to much stock for very long _ but still big enough in
some cases to warrant second mortgages, sell-offs of assets,
cancellations of Caribbean vacations.
</P>
<P>
   On the west side of Los Angeles, where for months home-based
investors have reaped the stock market whirlwind and contributed to
a furious boom in house prices and trendy new restaurant openings,
the sobriety of the moment was sinking in fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm down 20 percent, what can I tell you?'' said day trader
Lorraine Conn, who missed part of the big slide in prices over the
past few days because she was sunning herself on a beach in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``This may be a bust moment for e-tailers and e-commerce
companies, but the big backbone companies like Cisco will bounce
back. We're seeing a lot of margin selling but I think the market
will hit bottom pretty soon.''
</P>
<P>
   Glen Mathison, a spokesman for Charles Schwab, acknowledged
there had been ``some level of dizziness'' but said most of his
company's clients were level-headed enough to take a long-term view
and not give themselves over to panic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a busy day,'' he said. ``But we haven't seen a big
volume of requests for help. We try to encourage people not to
overreact to short-term fluctuations in the market.''
</P>
<P>
   That did not mean the atmosphere was any less than frantic in
the homes of day traders or at securities brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>
   Most at risk were the short-term individual investors who had
bought up batches of a few hundred shares in hi-tech stocks on the
Nasdaq index.
</P>
<P>
   When the index plummeted, as it did on Monday and again Tuesday,
those stocks reached a value so low that the difference in purchase
price and current selling price exceeded the credit limit those
investors had with their brokerage firms.
</P>
<P>

saying that they were collecting their debts by forcing their

``semi-long-term,'' would hit a ``semi-bottom.''

 By DAVID USBORNE  
 c.2000 The Independent, London  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Where euphoria use to reign, a frenzied despair,
verging on panic, gripped Wall Street at times Tuesday as the
Nasdaq exchange staged a second dizzying plunge in the wake of the
Microsoft antitrust ruling and the Dow Jones industrial average
index suddenly threatened similarly to lose its footing.
</P>
<P>
   For many small investors it was their first encounter with a
bear market. The shock waves, and the pain, rippled across America,
which in recent years has become a nation of stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the country was suddenly feeling less wealthy and less
sure about its mutual funds and retirement plans. But by
mid-afternoon, there were signs that investors were moving back in
to pick up cheap stocks and the worst of the losses would be pared.
</P>
<P>
   Hi-tech stock in London suffered a similar, if less severe,
retreat, dragging the FTSE 100 to a four-week low. The tech-heavy
U.K. techMARK index sank more than 350 points to close at 3,731
points.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile victims included the raft of New Economy stocks
that recently gained inclusion in the FTSE 100 index and the
Web-based retailer, lastminute.com.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said the sell-down was inspired both by the ruling,
issued late on Monday in Washington, on Microsoft's violation of
anti-monopoly laws, and by investors' concerns over the sky-high
valuations that the sector has attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious passersby were gathering Tuesday outside the Nasdaq
exchange's giant ticker wall on Times Square in New York to absorb
the gravity of what was happening inside. The Nasdaq is home to
most of the hi-tech and Internet stocks that until recently had
been so hot.
</P>
<P>
   Most seemed determined to remain calm. ``I am not too worried
and I am just looking for the bottom, then this may turn out to be
another buying opportunity,'' noted Brian Haber, who was at the
window. He expected his Microsoft shares to pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the Nasdaq might have managed a limited recovery
after losing 7.3 percent of its value on Monday were dashed in
morning trading Tuesday. By the lunch hour in New York it had
slipped another 11.25 percent to below 3,749 and was more than 20
percent off its all-time high of 5,0848.62, hit on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was shaping up to be the worst day in the Nasdaq's short
history.
</P>
<P>
   Several recently floated hi-tech companies were being torn
apart. Electronic share-dealing firms were among the worst hit.
Where so many of these companies have been used to making daily
double-digit gains, Tuesday they saw frightening double-digit
losses. The electronic Nasdaq tickers were nearly all flushed with
red.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves were further frayed by a parallel slide on the Dow Jones.
Home to most of the old-guard blue-chip companies, it resisted the
hi-tech slide and rose by 300 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly at mid-morning Tuesday, however, it seemed to succumb
to the Nasdaq virus and begin its own swoon. Three hours before the
close it was off by 416 points, or about 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trading curbs were repeatedly activated on the exchanges as
brokers scrambled to cope with one of the most frantic days in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off was being exacerbated as investors faced margin
calls on their stock holdings, giving them no choice but to sell.
By 1 p.m. the Nasdaq index, which opened the year at 4,069, was
below 3,700.
</P>
<P>
   How much further can Wall Street fall? Nobody knew Tuesday
night. One thing that is for sure, however, the worry that the
Federal Reserve has repeatedly expressed, that the markets in the
U.S. have been wildly overpriced, will now be eased.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on Alan Greenspan to raise interest rates further is
similarly likely to recede, analysts noted. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Where euphoria use to reign, a frenzied despair,
verging on panic, gripped Wall Street at times Tuesday as the
Nasdaq exchange staged a second dizzying plunge in the wake of the
Microsoft antitrust ruling and the Dow Jones industrial average
index suddenly threatened similarly to lose its footing.
</P>
<P>
   For many small investors it was their first encounter with a
bear market. The shock waves, and the pain, rippled across America,
which in recent years has become a nation of stockholders.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the country was suddenly feeling less wealthy and less
sure about its mutual funds and retirement plans. But by
mid-afternoon, there were signs that investors were moving back in
to pick up cheap stocks and the worst of the losses would be pared.
</P>
<P>
   Hi-tech stock in London suffered a similar, if less severe,
retreat, dragging the FTSE 100 to a four-week low. The tech-heavy
U.K. techMARK index sank more than 350 points to close at 3,731
points.
</P>
<P>
   High-profile victims included the raft of New Economy stocks
that recently gained inclusion in the FTSE 100 index and the
Web-based retailer, lastminute.com.
</P>
<P>
   Brokers said the sell-down was inspired both by the ruling,
issued late on Monday in Washington, on Microsoft's violation of
anti-monopoly laws, and by investors' concerns over the sky-high
valuations that the sector has attracted.
</P>
<P>
   Anxious passersby were gathering Tuesday outside the Nasdaq
exchange's giant ticker wall on Times Square in New York to absorb
the gravity of what was happening inside. The Nasdaq is home to
most of the hi-tech and Internet stocks that until recently had
been so hot.
</P>
<P>
   Most seemed determined to remain calm. ``I am not too worried
and I am just looking for the bottom, then this may turn out to be
another buying opportunity,'' noted Brian Haber, who was at the
window. He expected his Microsoft shares to pick up again.
</P>
<P>
   Hopes that the Nasdaq might have managed a limited recovery
after losing 7.3 percent of its value on Monday were dashed in
morning trading Tuesday. By the lunch hour in New York it had
slipped another 11.25 percent to below 3,749 and was more than 20
percent off its all-time high of 5,0848.62, hit on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   It was shaping up to be the worst day in the Nasdaq's short
history.
</P>
<P>
   Several recently floated hi-tech companies were being torn
apart. Electronic share-dealing firms were among the worst hit.
Where so many of these companies have been used to making daily
double-digit gains, Tuesday they saw frightening double-digit
losses. The electronic Nasdaq tickers were nearly all flushed with
red.
</P>
<P>
   Nerves were further frayed by a parallel slide on the Dow Jones.
Home to most of the old-guard blue-chip companies, it resisted the
hi-tech slide and rose by 300 points on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly at mid-morning Tuesday, however, it seemed to succumb
to the Nasdaq virus and begin its own swoon. Three hours before the
close it was off by 416 points, or about 3.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Trading curbs were repeatedly activated on the exchanges as
brokers scrambled to cope with one of the most frantic days in
recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   The sell-off was being exacerbated as investors faced margin
calls on their stock holdings, giving them no choice but to sell.
By 1 p.m. the Nasdaq index, which opened the year at 4,069, was
below 3,700.
</P>
<P>
   How much further can Wall Street fall? Nobody knew Tuesday
night. One thing that is for sure, however, the worry that the
Federal Reserve has repeatedly expressed, that the markets in the
U.S. have been wildly overpriced, will now be eased.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure on Alan Greenspan to raise interest rates further is
similarly likely to recede, analysts noted. &QL;

 &HT;    WORKER SHORTAGE THREATENS TECH BOOM, CLINTON WARNED
 &HT;    With E-COMMERCE-GATES. Moving in (w) Washington and (f)
financial categories.
 &HT;    By MARILYN GEEWAX
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While the longest economic expansion in U.S.
history remains healthy, a looming shortage of workers could
threaten the good times, President Clinton was warned Wednesday by
top economic thinkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This economy has gotten not just bigger, but also better,''
said Abby Joseph Cohen of Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co., one of Wall
Street's most influential analysts. But because this ``better''
economy requires more skilled workers, boosting education will be
``our greatest challenge in the coming years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan agreed that today's
labor pool, the tightest in a generation, may not keep pace with
employers' needs. As result, the central bank has had no choice but
to nudge up interest rates to cool the economy and keep labor
supply and demand in balance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Greenspan warned that ``short of a repeal of the law of
supply and demand,'' if labor shortages develop they will ``almost
surely'' make wages rise faster than productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan and Cohen were among dozens of ``A list'' economists
and business leaders who joined Clinton in a day-long discussion on
how to keep the ``new economy'' growing.
</P>
<P>
   Even Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates couldn't resist the
invitation to the ornate East Room of the White House, despite his
battle with the Clinton administration. Just two days after the
company he co-founded was found guilty of anti-trust violations in
a case brought by the Justice Department, Gates sat next to the
president on a panel.
</P>
<P>
   Americans are living through ``an economic transformation as
profound as (the one) that led us into the Industrial Revolution,''
Clinton said in opening remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The president recalled that when he held his first economic
summit in Arkansas shortly after his 1992 election, ``unemployment
was high, interest rates were high, the deficit was exploding, the
debt had quadrupled, and even an apparent recovery was generating
no jobs.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the U.S. economy has flourished amid an explosion of
new technologies that are boosting productivity and jobs. ``I
believe the computer and the Internet give us a chance to move more
people out of poverty more quickly than at any time in all of human
history,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, considered a leading optimist on Wall Street, agreed that
the ``new economy'' is generating opportunities for workers,
entrepreneurs and stock investors. ``For the past decade, we have
been enthusiastic about the outlook for U.S. prices,'' she said.
``And we remain so.''
</P>
<P>
   But amid the enthusiasm for a tech-driven economy, many speakers
said the nation's educational system must do a better job of
getting more people, regardless of economic background, into the
ranks of skilled workers.
</P>
<P>
   Another note of caution was sounded by International economist
C. Fred Bergsten, who said he was worried about ``the huge and
growing trade deficit.'' That imbalance, which hit a record high of
$267.6 billion last year, could trigger a panic in which foreign
investors flee U.S. markets and drive down the value of the dollar.
``A sharp decline in the dollar would push up interest rates and
push down the stock market,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while the economists weighed the possibilities for an end to
today's prosperity, they generally were upbeat. University of Texas
economics professor James K. Galbraith was perhaps the cheeriest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despite the nervousness of the markets, these are good
times,'' he said. ``They are very good times.'' With wise
leadership in Washington and cooperation from the Federal Reserve,
``we can continue to grow and prosper,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   David Silvester, owner of Zeus Lightning Rod Inc. in Hopewell,
N.J., knows that proselytizing is hopeless: not until an electrical
storm gives homeowners firsthand experience _ when it blows their
chimneys apart, zaps their computer disk drives and fries their
air-conditioners _ do they think of buying a lightning rod. Until
then, they consider the chore as pressing as recaulking the
windows.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it after you've been hit,'' said Karen
Shapiro, who bought a lightning rod after her Georgian-style home
in Croton-on-Hudson was struck last summer. ``Something that
sounded like a cannon went off next to the house,'' she recalled,
and _ mid-e-mail _ her computer screen went black. Much of her and
her husband's other electronic equipment also went down, and the
laptop computer was destroyed. They bought a $3,000 lightning
protection system with lightning rods and surge suppressors for the
electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Matthew Martin of Sanbourne, N.Y., was finally moved
to act in July, when a bolt shot through his window and ignited the
sofa and rug in a fire that spread rapidly through the entire
house. ``Only the walls and the roof were left,'' said his fiancee,
Marisa Crane.
</P>
<P>
   Statistics confirm that lightning exacts a heavy toll on homes
across the country, particularly in the Northeast, which has the
most violent thunderstorms. The National Fire Protection
Association's most recent report, covering 1993 to 1997, said that
on average there are 6,150 lightning-related fires a year resulting
in 11 deaths and $129.7 million in residential property damage.
</P>
<P>
   Policyholders submitted 500,000 lightning-related claims to
State Farm Fire and Casualty Co. between 1995 and 1999. ``Among all
of our reported fire losses, lightning damage is the leading cause
and represents one of the most costly types of damage that State
Farm pays,'' said Phil Supple, a company spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Modernization and the advent of the wired home make lightning a
greater threat to property. ``One thing that has changed is the
proliferation of electronic equipment, which is sensitive to
lightning,'' said Richard Kithil, founder of the National Lightning
Safety Institute, a nonprofit organization in Louisville, Colo. In
1997, according to statistics cited by Kithil, lightning destroyed
101,000 laptop and desktop computers.
</P>
<P>
   Anything with microcircuitry, including digital television sets,
security systems and portable phones, is especially at risk.
Lightning, even when it hits many miles away, can travel through a
power line or phone line and deliver 20,000 to 30,000 amps, enough
to melt the delicate circuitry in a modem.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Ed Frank, a licensed engineer with the home inspection
company InspectAmerica Engineering, in White Plains, said lightning
rods are rare in old and new houses alike. Similarly, Sylvester
said, ``only the high-end builders building custom houses recommend
them to customers.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony F. Abone, a real estate agent in Rome, N.Y., could not
remember the last time he saw one on a new house.
</P>
<P>
   One reason may be the cost: to outfit a 2,500-square-foot house
with a standard system, which includes several lightning rods
(often called air terminals), and a central surge suppressor at the
main fuse box, costs about $2,500, according to Underwriters
Laboratories, the safety certification organization.
</P>
<P>
   Suzanne Brinn of Folsom, N.J., said the cost kept her from
adding a lightning rod to her three-story Victorian home. ``You
don't want to put money out because it's not something you see;
it's like buying insurance,'' said Brinn, who installed a rod after
a co-worker's home was hit.
</P>
<P>
   Other homeowners could be put off by the perception that
lightning rods are crudely ineffective relics of another era. There
are also the rare naysayers. ( Kithil believes chances are slim
that a house will be hit dead-on and said surge suppressors are
more important.)
</P>
<P>
   But watchdog groups like the National Fire Protection
Association and Underwriters Laboratories believe that lightning
rods are essential; one proponent likens them to plumbing in terms
of lasting usefulness. Among the believers is Charles Moore, a
lightning expert and professor emeritus at Langmuir Laboratory for
Atmospheric Research at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and
Technology in Socorro, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   Made of materials that conduct electricity easily, like copper
and aluminum, the rod acts as the path of least resistance. The
lightning charge passes to wire conductors alongside the house
(either inside or outside the walls), which are connected to ground
rods driven into the earth about 2 feet from the house.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs a lightning rod? Homes in large, empty fields are at
obvious risk. But so are houses in suburban areas that are not
surrounded by larger structures, which act as targets. (This
explains why buildings in cities may need only surge suppressors;
the Empire State Building, for example, acts as a lightning rod for
the buildings nearby.)
</P>
<P>
   One of the many myths about lightning is that flat-roofed houses
are safer from strikes than peak-roofed ones. Not true, said Moore.
The corners on any building are vulnerable, he explained, while the
edges of the roofs are the prime strike points, so the pitch of a
roof is inconsequential.
</P>
<P>
   Nor will trees protect homes from lightning. Trees do not
conduct electricity well, and if struck they can crack and fall
thunderously on the house. ``We felt the house shake,'' said Jill
Papenhausen of Haddonfield, N.J., whose house was struck a year
ago. ``A tree had gone through the picture window.''
</P>
<P>
   Wayne Koshofer, owner of Koshofer Lightning Protection Inc., in
Westchester, N.Y., recommends installing seven lightning rods on a
30-foot-by-80-foot home. ``The best way to protect your home if
you're surrounded by large trees is to put lightning rods in the
trees themselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Hartnett, a project engineer with Underwriters
Laboratories, says lightning rods should be spaced no more than 20
feet apart.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to another myth, lightning rods, which typically
measure 10 to 12 inches, are not significantly taller than the roof
line and do not increase the chances of the house's being hit. They
only attract lightning that would otherwise be hitting the house.
</P>
<P>
   Surge suppressors for individual pieces of equipment are
recommended, Hartnett said, because lightning protection standards
are not designed ``to protect solid state or electronic equipment
within a structure, but to prevent fire or explosions within a
building.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that homeowners with electronic equipment may want to
add surge suppressors at points like the power strips or electrical
boxes that are installed to accommodate appliances and phone lines.
Surge suppressors are sold for under $10 (the UL stamp means the
suppressor complies with the most recent requirements) and are
recommended for sensitive equipment like the computer _ not the
toaster oven.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Suspicion over the effectiveness of the lightning rod is as old
as Ben Franklin's 1752 invention itself. It was sold door-to-door
to incredulous homeowners; there were no general standards in the
industry, and each salesman had a theory as to the best design and
installation. (The lightning rod salesman is lampooned in Herman
Melville's short story ``The Lightning-Rod Man.'') Today the only
real debate _ if you can call it that _ is over the relative merits
of different models. Franklin designed a pointy lightning rod, but
it was soon challenged by a blunt version introduced by the
British. Possibly for patriotic reasons, pointy has stayed the
American standard. Most shapes will do, Underwriters Laboratories
says.
</P>
<P>
   Installation is not typically a do-it-yourself job (the UL
installation requirements fill more than 45 pages). For example,
any metallic objects grounded near the house, including water
pipes, have to be accounted for to prevent lightning from being
directed toward the house and causing a fire.
</P>
<P>
   Underwriters Laboratories recommends that even if a home comes
with a lightning protection system, the new owner have it inspected
to ensure installation was done properly. Underwriters Laboratories
puts its stamp on systems and can verify whether it lists a local
installer; information from (847) 272-8800, extension 12578.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Proper lightning protection is a lasting investment, as Robert
McCracken and his wife, Sarah, can attest. In 1993, they returned
to their weekend home in Lyme, Conn., to find that lightning had
destroyed a hemlock tree 30 feet from the house before shooting
along the ground, hitting an irrigation pipe in the yard and
splitting it wide open. The bolt kept going, right into the house,
``frying everything there was to fry,'' McCracken said.
</P>
<P>
   The couple installed lightning rods and surge suppressors, and
they believe that in the seven years since, the home has survived
potentially nasty hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to say, it's working,'' McCracken said. &QL;

   NEW YORK _ Giggles galore greet the gaggle of frogs that
populate the first of the nine captivating vignettes that are
sending the talented performers of the Imago Theater Mask Ensemble
hopping, slithering, jiggling, undulating, waddling, strutting and
rolling over the stage of the New Victory Theater these days.
</P>
<P>
   The impetus for all this varied movement, which also evokes
outright laughter, oohs and enthusiastic applause from children and
adults alike, is a gently humorous, charmingly creative show called
``Frogs, Lizards, Orbs and Slinkys,'' scheduled for five more
performances Friday through Sunday at the warm and welcoming
theater in Times Square.
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by music that ranges from the tinkling bells of Bali
to the scores of old westerns and never speaking a coherent word, a
supple, talented troupe of five from Portland, Ore., with a
well-developed taste for mischief is providing a novel diversion.
</P>
<P>
   Even the announcement of the intermission in this
one-hour-and-45-minute show created by Carol Triffle and Jerry
Mouawad is turned into clever entertainment, as three masked
performers in striped clown costumes with bulbous bellies or
bulbous behinds create a tottering tower of lettered cartons to
spell out their intent.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has ever enjoyed a Slinky toy is bound to respond to
the sight of three human-size versions curling across the stage,
looking at times likely to flop into the audience and then pulling
back, contracting like accordions and all the time appearing to
have very lifelike emotions, including a sense of humor.
</P>
<P>
   The long, long two-faced alligators with glowing eyes and the
enormous lizard that joins them are moody menaces, and a huge paper
bag that pulses with life, stands up, tips this way and that while
eventually emitting some strange yowls, turns out to have an inner
life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the cleverest of the vignettes tells the tale of a
handlebar-mustached, bowlegged cowboy of the Old West who has a
screen for a face. And as the cowpoke's hand cranks the screen, the
story unspools through illustrations by the cartoonist George Smith
that track the cowboy's ordeal under a blazing desert sun to a
saloon and an encounter with a gunslinger.
</P>
<P>
   Besides all this, there are glow-in-the-dark strings that assume
all manner of beguiling shapes, an acrobatic larva, huge fabric
orbs that roll all over the place and a pack of penguins that play
a not-so-sporting but very funny game of musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   With all its movement, ``Frogs, Lizards, Orbs and Slinkys''
turns out to be an exercise in audience relaxation and inventive
fun.
</P>

HAMANA DIRECTOR HEADING TO SEATTLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JEFFREY ERIC JENKINS  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOUISVILLE _ Look out Seattle, a Louisville Slugger is on the
way. This particular heavy hitter is no candidate for the Baseball
Hall of Fame, but someone should consider making space for him in
the theatrical version.
</P>
<P>
   With the closing of the 24th Humana Festival of New American
Plays this coming weekend, director Jon Jory and his family will
begin making the transition from their home in this languid Ohio
River town to the lively environs of Seattle's U District.
</P>
<P>
   After 31 years as artistic head of Actors Theatre of Louisville
_ where he produced nearly 1,400 productions that included more
than 290 new plays _ Jory will join the University of Washington
School of Drama in the fall as a tenured professor.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, Jory and his talented spouse, costume
designer Marcia Dixcy Jory, have their hands full with an annual
new play festival that attracts critics, agents, producers and
theater people from around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The 2000 festival includes works by 31 playwrights, a
satisfyingly symmetrical number considering the length of Jory's
tenure in Louisville. As in past years, though, only a half-dozen
of the 33 pieces on display can be considered fully realized
dramatic works. A 75-minute dramatic anthology of 19 scenes, for
instance, is little more than a contrivance to make sure that
festival visitors see performances by the company's young
apprentices.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's innovation, so-called ``phone plays,'' already
appears somewhat shopworn. The now-traditional 10-minute plays
feature Tina Howe, Naomi Wallace and David Ives writing crisp, if
familiar vignettes. But all of the brief interludes are mere
appetizers for the main course of six full-length plays.
</P>
<P>
   Many playwrights have become identified with the Humana
festival, but none more so than Kentucky playwright Jane Martin.
The pseudonymous Martin frequently tackles subjects that are edgy
and ``politically incorrect'' _ often topics of particular interest
to women. But the author tends to balance her conflicts and avoid
simplistic resolutions to issues.
</P>
<P>
   Although no one who has ever seen her will describe her, many
believe Jory himself is Martin. He is her director at Humana and
his own plays stopped appearing about the time that she arrived on
the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Whoever Martin is, though, she is certainly a sophisticated
observer of the theater. Her current comedy, ``Anton in Show
Business,'' lacerates everyone in sight as she satirizes actors,
directors, producers, funders and critics. Seven women play 16
roles _ including several male ones _ as the author pokes fun at
Hollywood ambition, cross-dressing, multiculturalism and the grand
tradition of rehearsal romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anton'' looks at the troubles encountered when artists with
big aspirations (and very little money) attempt a production of
Chekhov's ``The Three Sisters'' in San Antonio _ a city notorious
for its battles over arts funding in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   One critic seated nearby turned and said, ``it's the great
kiss-off.'' But Martin's own critic in the play _ who is planted in
the audience and stops the action from time to time to question or
complain _ turns the author's pen on herself when she complains
that the play satirizes ``something dead in culture'' (theater),
which is like ``beating a dead horse ... from the inside.''
</P>
<P>
   Self-consciously echoing the Chekhov play in its approach to the
importance of work, Martin's play is ultimately upbeat and
life-affirming. Crisply staged by Jory, ``Anton'' is both raucously
funny and painful to watch. And we never quite shake the sense that
this is a farewell to the troops.
</P>
<P>
   The other strong showing at the festival is Charles F. Mee's
``Big Love,'' a sprawling tale _ literally and figuratively _ that
pits 50 brides against 50 brothers. Based on Aeschylus' ``The
Suppliant Women,'' the play unearths every unpleasant stereotype
about the relationships between men and women. The antagonists rant
and rail at one another until words no longer suffice. Then,
passions bubble up from deep within their bodies and the actors
explode in a maelstrom of physical expression. The result is
powerfully affecting in its humor and its madness.
</P>
<P>
   In ``War of the Worlds,'' director Anne Bogart examines the life
and work of Orson Welles by mirroring the director's storytelling
style in the film ``Citizen Kane.'' But beneath the surface of the
Welles story, Bogart and her collaborator, Naomi Iizuka, also probe
the nature of truth, reality and identity. Notions of ``reality''
are commented on by shifting our gaze away from what we know or
believe to be true. Bogart and Iizuka demonstrate how reality can
be constructed by manipulating its presentation. The lingering
image of this poignant piece is that of an artist unhinged by his
personal demons.
</P>
<P>
   We expect artists to raise questions about life and our role in
the world around us. In this year's festival offerings, there seems
to be more pondering than usual. Why, these playwrights seem to
ask, must we live with so much pain?
</P>
<P>
   For the departing Jory, an exciting new life awaits in Seattle.
There is a new home, new students, new colleagues. Will the
artistic directorates of Seattle theaters open their doors to the
accomplished director? They are foolish if they do not.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, we needn't weep for Jory. Now that he is no
longer burdened with running the most important new play festival
in the United States, his work is bound to appear in theaters
around the country, off-Broadway and on.
</P>
<P>
   There's just one other question. Will Jane Martin fit into his
suitcase?
</P>

conclude the case and impose a remedy on the software giant by
roughly the end of May, and the state attorneys general who have

   SCI-BIOTECH-FOOD (Undated) _ Amid growing concerns over possible
risks posed by genetically modified crops, the National Academy of
Sciences took a new tack on biotech organisms, issuing a report
Wednesday calling for stronger regulation of the novel plants and
pointing to the potential for both food and environmental hazards.
While noting the potential for problems, the report stated that so
far there is no evidence that any genetically modified foods
currently on the market are unsafe to eat. By Carol Kaesuk Yoon and

   NY-LAPD-RECRUIT (New York) _ Faced with calls to increase the
diversity of its force and an expected exodus of officers, the New
York City Police Department embarked on an ambitious recruiting
drive over the past several years. The department learned Wednesday
that the drive had produced only 5,500 people interested in taking
the qualifying test this year, a 50 percent drop from the year
before. But, as New York struggles to lure its residents to its own
department, police recruiters from Los Angeles have come to the New
York Police Department's own hiring turf with promises of warmer
climes, higher starting salaries and openings at the academy as
soon as this summer. By C.J. Chivers.

<P>
   AIDS-DRUG (Paris) _ The 23 million Africans infected with the
AIDS virus should be given regular doses of a common and affordable
antibiotic, the World Health Organization and UNAids said
Wednesday, as a way to ward off fatal secondary infections. They
based their recommendation on encouraging preliminary studies, and
added that if the results are borne out, the impact could be
dramatic. Many people could add years to their lives and have
longer gaps between debilitating complications. But the antibiotic
is not a cure for the fatal disease. The drug, known as
trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or as cotrimoxazole, is marketed as a
generic drug in the U.S. called Bactrim. It can cost as little as
$8 a year in Africa. Its use for prophylaxis there was endorsed for
the first time last week by AIDS experts who convened in Zimbabwe
to assess the new studies. The Clinton administration is spending
more than $100 million to fight AIDS in Africa and trying to raise
that to $325 million. It may spend millions of those dollars to
help distribute Bactrim in Africa, but has not yet calculated how
much to commit. By Donald G. McNeil Jr.
</P>
<P>
   HERMAN-CLEARED (Washington) _ The independent prosecutor who has
been investigating accusations of corruption involving Alexis
Herman, the Clinton administration's secretary of labor, said
Wednesday he has concluded that Herman did not break any laws and
should not be indicted. Herman, the fifth Cabinet officer in the
Clinton administration to come under the scrutiny of an independent
counsel, was accused by a former business partner of engaging in a
plan involving kickbacks and solicitation of illegal campaign
contributions to the Democratic Party. But Ralph Lancaster, who
conducted the the 23-month-long investigation, announced in a
one-sentence statement that he would not seek an indictment of
Herman. By David Johnston and Neil A. Lewis.

TOMMASO BUSCETTA, ITALIAN MOB LEADER AND WITNESS , DEAD AT 71 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALESSANDRA STANLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROME _ Tommaso Buscetta, the first important Italian mob leader
to break the Mafia's oath of silence and who gave testimony that
helped convict hundreds of Mafia leaders in Italy and the United
States, died of cancer on Sunday, his Italian lawyer, Luigi
Liggotti said. He was 71 and living at an undisclosed location
under the American witness protection program.
</P>
<P>
   Italy's best known ``pentito'' _ the Italian word for a penitent
is now used to describe Mafia informers _ Buscetta was a ruthless
pioneer in the Sicilian Mafia's turn to drug trafficking. His
decision in 1984 to cooperate with Italian and later U.S.
prosecutors changed the course of one of the darker chapters of
modern Italian history.
</P>
<P>
   Buscetta's testimony about heroin smuggling in the ``pizza
connection'' case in the mid-1980s won him American citizenship, a
place in the U.S. witness protection program and the gratitude of
Italian and American law enforcement. Notoriety gave him a public
forum for disingenuous expiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Over the years, I have seen our organization change from
within,'' Buscetta, speaking behind a screen, told U.S. senators at
a 1988 hearing on organized crime. ``I have seen money, drugs and
greed corrupt and destroy the Cosa Nostra code of honor and loyalty
to the families.''
</P>
<P>
   His career as a mobster-turned-state witness spanned the highs
and lows of Italy's long, bloody battle against organized crime.
The government's reliance on ``pentiti'' culminated with the 1993
arrest of Salvatore Riina, whom Buscetta identified as the head of
the Sicilian mafia. But it reached its nadir two years later. In
August 1995, Buscetta, back under Italian government protection to
testify against former prime minister Giulio Andreotti, was
photographed by a journalist on a Mediterranean cruise ship,
sunbathing and mamboing in the ship's ballroom.
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti was found innocent of colluding with Mafia chieftains
in two trials last year, partly because the testimony of Buscetta,
who mentioned Andreotti's reputed intimacy with mob leaders eight
years after he joined the witness protection program, was hearsay.
</P>
<P>
   Andreotti, seven times prime minister and one of Italy's most
powerful postwar politicians, noted Buscetta's passing with his
customary dryness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pleased the state helped him try all the cures,'' he
told reporters on Tuesday. ``It would have been very serious if his
illness had stopped him from attending my trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Buscetta, the son of a Sicilian glazier, began his criminal
career in the black market after World War II, moved to Argentina
in 1948, then back to Sicily to join the Mafia in 1957. He fled mob
turf wars and local law enforcement in 1962 and was on the lam for
10 years until he was arrested in Rio de Janeiro on international
drug trafficking charges and extradited to Sicily, where he served
eight years in jail.
</P>
<P>
   His release coincided with a fierce power struggle between his
clan and Riina's mob, a bloodbath that cost him many relatives,
including two sons. He again fled to Brazil, and was arrested there
in 1983. Learning that he was about to be extradited back to Italy,
Buscetta made an unsuccessful suicide attempt by swallowing
strychnine. In 1984, three days after his plane landed in Rome, he
told a top mafia prosecutor, Giovanni Falcone, words that quickly
became famous: ``I am a mafioso.'' He began talking and did not
stop for 45 days.
</P>
<P>
   Buscetta, a self-described ``man of honor'' in the Mafia
hierarchy, didn't just provide investigators with names and dates.
He painted an intimate portrait of the means and mores of the Cosa
Nostra, explaining the sometimes complex, often feudal rituals,
codes, and castes below the surface of organized crime.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Falcone and his fellow prosecutor Paolo
Borsellino, won the first ``maxi-trials'' in Sicily, putting
hundreds of mobsters behind bars. That victory unleashed a decade
of unbridled violence as the mafia brazenly challenged the state,
killing judges, prosecutors and local officials. Falcone and
Borsellino, two of Italy's most respected magistrates, were
assassinated within two months of each other in 1992. In 1996,
Riina was convicted of conspiring in the murder of Borsellino and
five bodyguards and the next year he was convicted of ordering the
assassination of Falcone, his wife and three bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
   Buscetta, who had three wives in three different countries and
seven children, was so famous in Italy that he earned a certain
cachet. In 1994, the design house Dolce e Gabbana brought out a
men's spring collection inspired by the mobster, featuring black
pinstripe suits, shiny pointed shoes and black sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   When his death became known on Tuesday, Buscetta was mourned by
Italian prosecutors and government officials as a hero of the war
against organized crime _ jarring accolades for a man who once
described the ``liberating'' feeling that comes with pulling the
trigger and watching an opponent fall.
</P>
<P>
   On the meaner streets of Palermo, however, the word ``buscetta''
has become a slang insult in the same the way ``sbirro'' is a
pejorative term for a cop.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a pentito,'' Buscetta once told Enzo Biagi, one of
Italy's best known journalists. ``I am a man who had to defend
himself and to do so, had to tell the truth.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ What is reality?
</P>
<P>
   For the $6.2 billion artificial, dried and preserved flower and
foliage industry, it is not a metaphysical question or a joke.
</P>
<P>
   Business is blooming: a 35 percent increase over the last five
years for the domestic wholesale ``permanent botanicals'' industry,
as it calls itself, according to a 1999 study commissioned by the
American Flower Importers Association, a trade association, and the
Dallas Market Center, the trade capital of permanent floral
products.
</P>
<P>
   And resistance is wilting. A mainstay of hotels, offices, malls
and atriums, they don't require watering or spraying. They don't
produce pests or provoke allergic reactions (and subsequent
lawsuits). They resist the effects of chemicals like pool chlorine.
And because they stay pretty and ``live'' forever, permanent
botanicals are making inroads into home decor.
</P>
<P>
   Now permanent floral products are finding themselves at home
where they might least be expected: outdoors in the garden. For a
family living in a ground-floor duplex apartment on the Upper East
Side in New York, the situation was too real: a charming back court
with a view of the Cottages, a row of 1930s stores topped by
apartments overlooking an interior garden, that became a dark,
bricked-in well last year when the neighboring site was developed
as a 76-story luxury condominium.
</P>
<P>
   Not willing to lose the amenity of their garden, the homeowners
(a real estate broker and her husband, a lawyer) contacted
Christian Duvernois, a New York landscape designer. Duvernois, who
created an artificial garden for Hermes' East 57th Street boutique
in 1996, suggested for the new garden a folly, based as it would
have been in the 18th century, on the amusements of fakery.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in the wooded, informal grove, bowered by white birch
and trellised and vined with ivory cameo-size roses, canopied by
white and purple wisteria and tendriled by tender shoots of ivy, is
synthetic: several hundred plastic and polyester pieces and $20,000
worth of state-of-the-art sylvan parts. Nymphs will need knee-pads.
A gardener comes once a month to wash it, and ``plump it,'' as
Duvernois said. Delicate items, like hydrangea flowers, can be
popped off their stems and washed in the sink, inside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had no choice,'' said the homeowner, who asked not to be
identified. ``It was a beautiful, open garden before, then it was a
blank wall, now it's more beautiful.'' She explained: ``I'm sure
someone who wanted to be a slave to a garden could put in real
things, but I knew I couldn't keep it going. We spent a ton of
money putting ivy up, and that completely died, and we put in
bamboo, and then it died, and evergreens, and they died. I have no
problem with its being fake.''
</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to the garden, Duvernois, the designer,
straightened a yew with a firm yank, bent an ivy shoot to point it
back toward the wall it was intended to train on, then sat down to
talk at a wrought-iron garden table. A watering can by the gated
door to the kitchen had been put there ``for effect,'' he said. Two
plastic owls were being installed, near the second story window
boxes to discourage pigeons, which were a problem at Hermes.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the way, the trellis is plastic too,'' he said, gesturing
toward the 18-foot-high gazebo facade that towered above him and
was hand-twined with rose vines and wisteria twigs. Duvernois
created the architectural element, flanked by 15-foot white
birches, as a proscenium seen from the house, to break the
bluntness of the new cement-block wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we did the garden, a little overgrown, is exactly the
way they were making follies in the 18th century,'' he said,
explaining that the expectation for plastic plantings is that they
will be artificially prim. Duvernois' garden looks like a high
hairdo after a hard bounce.
</P>
<P>
   There were no problems in making it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very easy to deal with plastic plants, actually,'' he
said. ``If you need more, you just put one more in.'' He
demonstrated by jamming a hydrangea stem down through a leafy
tangle into its potting medium, a trash-bagged loose polystyrene
that Duvernois covers with real wood chips: a simulation trick.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can play with this garden,'' he said, beheading a rose
with a snap. ``It's really like a toy.'' The homeowners intend to
honor the seasons, more or less, by removing the flowers in the
fall and having them reappear in the spring, as plastic buds. The
garden is sheltered from harsh weather; wear and tear, and
replacement, is more typically a consequence of people touching the
plants to see if they are real.
</P>
<P>
   To realize the garden, Duvernois worked with Permanent Foliage,
a floral import and design company on West 26th Street (on the edge
of the flower district, though not by fiat), whose clients include
decorators like M Group, corporations like Sony and hospitality
groups like Marriott. They have shipped palms to Saudi Arabia,
orchids to Hawaii.The American Museum of Natural History in New
York bought materials from it in 1998 when they moved in their
annual live-butterfly exhibition, to help sell the butterflies on
their new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The butterflies wouldn't go to the real trees,'' said Lawton
Toodle, a partner with Permanent Foliage. ``The butterflies liked
our stuff better.'' John Walker, a partner and Permanent Foliage's
principal designer, said, ``The quality of the materials themselves
is phenomenal now.'' Walker, under the direction of Duvernois,
worked with three assistants for three weeks to complete the Upper
East Side garden. Thanks to newer technologies like
photographic-transfers, improved materials like polyesters and
foams and closer attention to fresh-flower trends, artificial
foliage and flowers are more realistic than they were even five
years ago. Many large wholesalers and designers like Supersilk in
Salt Lake City, which won last year's Fame award (the Oscar of
artificial plants), have showrooms in High Point, N.C., capital of
the domestic home furnishings industry, whose spring trade market
opens Thursday. Furniture retailers like Haverty, with 100 stores,
sell artificial flower and foliage arrangements as decorating
accessories.
</P>
<P>
   ``The permanent botanicals industry is a fashion business,''
said Beatrice Chang, executive vice president of Supersilk. ``It
follows fashion in home decor.'' The last big hullabaloo, now
dying: sunflowers, courtesy of the interest in Arts and Crafts.
This year's excitement: the feng shui look. ``Lots of reeds and
grasses,'' Chang said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Glasses propped on her close-cropped hair, a scarf
tossed around her regal neck, Heather Headley casually swivels on a
stool as she rehearses Elton John's ``Your Song'' in preparation
for a charity benefit in his honor. With the ease of a seasoned
rock singer, Headley holds the room rapt as she puts a fresh spin
on the familiar refrain, ``I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't
mind. ...''
</P>
<P>
   A few days later, at the benefit for two AIDS charities at
Broadway's New Amsterdam Theater, she brings down the house. One
would think Headley had been doing this kind of thing forever. But
she is only 25. It wasn't so long ago that she was a schoolgirl
walking barefoot on the shores of her native Trinidad, singing in
her church choir and dreaming of becoming the next Whitney Houston.
It was only three years ago that she won her first major role, as a
member of the ensemble and an understudy in the Toronto tryout of
``Ragtime'' _ a production she left to play Nala in the Broadway
cast of ``The Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, she opened to rave reviews in the title role of
Disney's Broadway show ``Aida.'' No more waiting in the wings for
the lead to get sick. No more lioness mask. Headley is now front
and center, singing to the rafters of the Palace Theater in the
Elton John version of Verdi's tragic romance about a Nubian
princess and her Egyptian captor.
</P>
<P>
   ``She not only has what is called It _ that ineffable, sensual
glow _ but also a voice of stunning emotional variety and
conviction,'' Ben Brantley wrote in The New York Times. The praise
for Headley, echoed by other critics, is particularly striking
given the generally poor, even harsh, reviews of ``Aida'' itself,
which has been characterized as style without substance. Headley
alone, some critics seem to be saying, is worth the price of
admission.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the life of the show proves to be, ``Aida'' is a major
moment for this young actress, proving that she can not only carry
a show but also lift it up. It has established her as a force to
watch. ``I felt from the beginning that when a New York audience
saw her, it would be like an audience in the '60s discovering
Barbra Streisand for the first time,'' said Robert Falls, the
director.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a powerful voice, Headley has an arresting poise
and intensity. When she appeared in the Encores concert production
of ``Do Re Mi'' last May, Brantley of The Times described her as
``a Modigliani-faced beauty,'' adding, ``She finds hypnotic
expressiveness in the simplest gestures, and you can't take your
eyes off her.''
</P>
<P>
   Falls repeatedly reminds Headley to ``keep it simple'' in
performances, in part it seems because she radiates so much feeling
without really trying that the slightest additional inflection or
gesture can be distracting.
</P>
<P>
   But as is often the case this early in a career, Headley seems
untouched by the fame that may be in store. She talked about her
sense of being lucky. Every night before a show begins, she walks
to the center of the curtain and prays, ``not calling all the gods,
just the main one,'' she said. By now, she said, the rest of the
cast and crew know to leave her alone at such moments.
</P>
<P>
   Headley said she needs a lot of solitude these days to
concentrate her energy and attention on this role. (She is also
working on her first solo album for Hollywood Records.) Friends
know not to call before 5 p.m. because Headley is resting her
voice. She does not go out after the show; she heads home to her
apartment in Washington Heights. ``My social life is kaput for
now,'' she said. ```Aida' is the boyfriend right now.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no problem staying at home,'' she continued. ``The way
I look at it, you're paying me to do something I do in the shower.
I'm honored and blessed that at 25 I have this role. Not in a proud
way, but in an awed, grateful way.''
</P>
<P>
   Adam Pascal, who plays Radames, the conquering Egyptian captain,
said that this ascetic lifestyle was typical of Headley. ``She's a
good girl in the truest sense of the word,'' Pascal said. ``Heather
doesn't curse, Heather doesn't drink, Heather doesn't smoke.''
</P>
<P>
   Headley grew up as the daughter of church pastors. A skinny
little girl with a big voice, she sang in church and, without any
formal voice training, tried to imitate Houston, Anita Baker and
CeCe Winans. ``I was just screaming,'' Headley said. ``the higher
the note, the louder you are, the better.''
</P>
<P>
   When she was 15, her parents moved the family _ she has one
younger brother _ from Trinidad to a new pulpit in Fort Wayne, Ind.
There, as a member of her school's show choir, Headley won several
awards for her solo performances, trophies that she said her mother
still refuses to put in the basement. In junior high school she
played Fanny Brice in ``Funny Girl.'' Deciding she wanted to go to
Northwestern University, Headley said she had to prepare four
arias, three of them in different languages. She listened to opera
recordings of stars like Kathleen Battle and tried to mold her
voice to sound like them.
</P>
<P>
   In her sophomore year Headley landed a leading role in a
production of ``Dreamgirls'' at the Marriott Lincolnshire Theater
in the suburbs just north of Chicago. Already working her way
through school as part of a scholarship, Headley began living a
double life, rising at dawn to do her schoolwork, attending class
until late afternoon, then heading to the theater and returning to
campus by midnight. The work paid off: she met her agent, Janet
Louer, who is now her manager.
</P>
<P>
   Next came an audition for ``Ragtime.'' She sang ``Out Here on My
Own'' from the movie ``Fame.'' Garth H. Drabinsky, then the
creative director of the production company Livent, along with the
lyricist, Lynn Ahrens, and the composer, Stephen Flaherty, came to
hear her sing. ``We saw her and said, `Who is this beautiful
creature?''' Ahrens recalled, ``and wooed her away from college.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining ``Ragtime'' in Toronto meant leaving Northwestern.
``Leaving school was a hard decision for me,'' Headley said. She
said she consulted each of her professors about the move. ``I was
crying as each one told me to go,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Now Headley believes it was the right choice. Working in Toronto
with seasoned performers like Audra McDonald, Brian Stokes Mitchell
and Marin Mazzie taught her the basics of being part of a
professional production. ``It was the best training I could ever
have,'' she said. ``How to be part of an ensemble, how to do my
makeup, how to dress in 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was by myself in a new country, and I couldn't call Mommy
for any and everything,'' she continued. ``I just grew up.''
</P>
<P>
   Next came the role of Nala in ``The Lion King.'' Then Disney
chose her for ``Aida.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We auditioned lots of people,'' said Peter Schneider, the
chairman of Walt Disney Studios and a producer of ``Aida.'' ``And
when she sang it and when she acted it, you felt the chemistry in
the room. You felt the star power.''
</P>
<P>
   Schneider said that Headley had come a long way from the days
when a young girl made her first trip to New York to sing in ``The
Lion King.''
</P>
<P>
   Headley said, on a visit to Trinidad in January, she was struck
by how much her life had changed. ``I walked places I had walked
barefoot or to piano lessons,'' she said. ``Back then, I didn't
know any of this was going to happen.''

 &HT;    CLINTON, GATES ALL SMILES AT WHITE HOUSE VISIT
 &HT;    With E-COMMERCE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton turned to Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates on Wednesday and asked him how the nation could encourage
more ``young billionaires'' like him to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was not talking about the Gates who has dug in his
heels in a legal battle with the federal government. Instead, he
was talking about the Gates who co-founded a charity that has
quickly vaulted to the top of the world's philanthropy charts.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was the East Room of the White House, where Clinton
had convened a day-long conference on the challenges and
opportunities posed by the ``new economy'' of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   As both men listened to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, Clinton gave Gates several friendly pats on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gates, seated to the president's immediate right, joined an
afternoon panel on ``Closing the Global Divide'' along with other
luminaries such as World Bank President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after the panel discussion,
Clinton cited philanthropists from an earlier era such as Andrew
Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller, who, he said, ``had
built monuments to our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have all these young people who have made a lot of
money,'' Clinton went on. Turning to the world's richest man, he
asked, ``what we can to encourage more philanthropy from this
group?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good question,'' Gates replied. I think about it a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not have any ready answers, other than allowing that
``as I learn more (about giving), I get more excited myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Philanthropy, if it is done the right way, can have a
tremendous impact,'' said Gates, whose Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation focuses on ways to help to improve peoples' lives
through health and learning. ``It's a full-time job. I need to
think about that some more.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no apparent exchange between the two men about
Monday's ruling by a federal judge in a case brought by Clinton's
Justice Department that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws,
harming consumers by stifling competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton left Gates to chat amiably with another attendee,
Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.
</P>
<P>
   He told the cabinet officer that ``unlike United Nations, who
have to defend themselves whatever they do in the developing world,
whether it works or not, we are free to spend $50 million and admit
we made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In his formal remarks to the panel, Gates said the ``technology
revolution has been one of the greatest job creation engines ever''
and will lead to ``breakthroughs that will allow computers to
listen, to learn, to be in a tablet form connected up to a wireless
network that you just carry around with you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the session ended, Gates and his small traveling party were
escorted to a private White House elevator, the first step on a
trip back to Seattle on a Microsoft jet.

 &HT;    With E-COMMERCE. Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton turned to Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates on Wednesday and asked him how the nation could encourage
more ``young billionaires'' like him to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was not talking about the Gates who has dug in his
heels in a legal battle with the federal government. Instead, he
was talking about the Gates who co-founded a charity that has
quickly vaulted to the top of the world's philanthropy charts.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was the East Room of the White House, where Clinton
had convened a day-long conference on the challenges and
opportunities posed by the ``new economy'' of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   As both men listened to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, Clinton gave Gates several friendly pats on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gates, seated to the president's immediate right, joined an
afternoon panel on ``Closing the Global Divide'' along with other
luminaries such as World Bank President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after the panel discussion,
Clinton cited philanthropists from an earlier era such as Andrew
Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller, who, he said, ``had
built monuments to our culture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have all these young people who have made a lot of
money,'' Clinton went on. Turning to the world's richest man, he
asked, ``what we can to encourage more philanthropy from this
group?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good question,'' Gates replied. I think about it a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not have any ready answers, other than allowing that
``as I learn more (about giving), I get more excited myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Philanthropy, if it is done the right way, can have a
tremendous impact,'' said Gates, whose Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation focuses on ways to help to improve peoples' lives
through health and learning. ``It's a full-time job. I need to
think about that some more.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no apparent exchange between the two men about
Monday's ruling by a federal judge in a case brought by Clinton's
Justice Department that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws,
harming consumers by stifling competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton left Gates to chat amiably with another attendee,
Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.
</P>
<P>
   He told the cabinet officer that ``unlike United Nations, who
have to defend themselves whatever they do in the developing world,
whether it works or not, we are free to spend $50 million and admit
we made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In his formal remarks to the panel, Gates said the ``technology
revolution has been one of the greatest job creation engines ever''
and will lead to ``breakthroughs that will allow computers to
listen, to learn, to be in a tablet form connected up to a wireless
network that you just carry around with you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the session ended, Gates and his small traveling party were
escorted to a private White House elevator, the first step on a
trip back to Seattle on a Microsoft jet.

volatile police shootings in New York is evidence of a political

RECOVERY OF OZONE MAY BE DELAYED BY COLDER TEMPERATURES OVER ARCTIC
REGION 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM K. STEVENS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Unusual cold and a sharp loss of ozone in the Arctic
stratosphere over the winter just past have heightened concern that
changes in global climate may delay recovery of the earth's
partially depleted ozone layer, scientists said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The stratospheric ozone layer, composed of a form of oxygen that
blocks some kinds of solar radiation, protects all forms of life
from the harmful effects of the sun's ultraviolet rays, which can
cause skin cancer, cataracts and damage to the immune system and
can harm natural ecosystems. If there were no ozone shield, plants
and animals could not exist on land.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, it was found that synthetic chemicals used in
refrigerants, plastic foams and aerosol propellants were destroying
the ozone layer. Production of the most destructive chemicals,
mainly chlorofluorocarbons, was halted or curtailed in the early
and mid-1990s by international agreement. Scientists say the
atmospheric concentrations of such chemicals have peaked and are
slowly decreasing.
</P>
<P>
   The ozone layer is expected to recover eventually, possibly by
the mid-21st century. But computer simulations of the atmosphere
have suggested that colder temperatures in the stratosphere, about
11 miles high, could increase the rate of ozone depletion in the
meantime, delaying recovery by a decade or two.
</P>
<P>
   Measurements taken by instruments carried aloft by aircraft and
balloons over the past winter have found that temperatures in the
crucial layer of the Arctic atmosphere were, indeed, among the
coldest on record, and that ozone losses of more than 60 percent
occurred.
</P>
<P>
   In three of the last five winters, stratospheric temperatures in
the Arctic were colder and more persistent, and covered a wider
area, than at any other time in the last 20 years, said Dr. Ross
Salawitch, an ozone researcher at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in
Pasadena, Calif. He was one of hundreds of U.S. and European
scientists from many institutions involved in the recent Arctic
survey.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's results were announced Wednesday by the Pasadena
laboratory and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's
Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.
</P>
<P>
   Most Arctic winters in the last decade brought unusually low
ozone coincident with an unusually cold stratosphere, according to
the World Meteorological Organization.
</P>
<P>
   When the Arctic region cools, ``that's bad news for the ozone,''
Salawitch said, adding that the new data has ``really solidified
our view'' that the ozone layer is sensitive not only to
ozone-destroying chemicals but also to temperature.
</P>
<P>
   He said the conditions observed this winter also ``heighten our
concern regarding possible couplings between climate change and
stratospheric ozone depletion.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozone depletion and global climate change are essentially
separate phenomena, but they can interact in some ways. For
example, emissions of heat-trapping industrial gases like carbon
dioxide, which warm the lower atmosphere, have the opposite effect
in the stratosphere: they cool it. Indeed, a general stratospheric
cooling has been observed in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Chlorofluorocarbons and other industrial chemicals cause large,
rapid ozone losses in the polar regions when the stratospheric
temperature reaches 105 to 110 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. The
critical threshold is reached only in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Over Antarctica, the coldest place on earth, severe ozone
depletion takes place every winter. In the Arctic, some winters are
too warm for a major depletion. But this year the temperature
stayed well below the threshold for long periods, sometimes
reaching 120 degrees below zero.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the long-term pattern could be changing toward a colder
Arctic stratosphere is an open question for researchers, Salawitch
said. One complicating factor, he added, is that the three plunges
to very cold temperatures in recent winters are much bigger than
the stratospheric cooling produced by emissions of gases like
carbon dioxide that warm the lower atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   It may be, Salawitch said, that some dynamic machinations within
the atmosphere are enhancing a stratospheric cooling by carbon
dioxide. Although computer models have suggested that such a
cooling might delay the recovery of the ozone layer by 10 to 20
years, scientists are far from pinning down the possible
relationship between climate change and ozone depletion, he said.
</P>
<P>
   While colder temperatures make the polar regions most
susceptible to ozone loss, midlatitude regions have experienced it
as well, although more gradually and to a much lesser extent.
</P>
<P>
   In a broad assessment of the ozone problem in 1998, the World
Meteorological Organization reported that the problem had eased in
the midlatitude regions, with the rate of depletion slowing.
</P>
<P>
   The report said that the peak of ozone depletion globally should
come within the next two decades, but that it would probably not be
discerned for some time after that.

WEB SURFER DELIVERS THE INTERNET 
</HEADLINE>
  By MICHEL MARRIOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mark Chamber's introduction to digital technology
came when he was an inquisitive teen-ager growing up in a rural
area of Jamaica.
</P>
<P>
   One day in 1985, a friend brought home a strange contraption
after visiting his father, a computer programmer who lived in
England.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was some kind of a computer, the first one I had ever
seen,'' Chambers recalled. The modest machine was made by the
British Broadcasting Corp. Similar to a Commodore 64, it had to be
connected to the family television set to work.
</P>
<P>
   Chambers, who was 13 at the time and had already impressed his
teachers with his talent for mathematics, raided a stash of
computer manuals belonging to his friend's father. In weeks,
Chambers was writing his first computer programs. Within a month he
had developed a simple game that the two boys could play on the PC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Writing software became my passion, and it still is,''
Chambers said. ``I started thinking of myself as a software
developer.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, at 27, Chambers has more than home-made video games to
his credit. He has created an Internet tool that is the culmination
of his self-taught mastery of software.
</P>
<P>
   Called Webbe, the software device appears on a computer screen
much like a virtual remote control. Webbe controls, integrates and
streamlines Internet functions like chat, e-mail, searches, news
alerts and buddy lists _ functions traditionally spread among
separate programs, browers and Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   Webbe manages the functions from a single place on the screen.
Chambers says it makes easy and intuitive what was often difficult
and confusing. He plans to license Webbe's technology to e-commerce
sites, which will be able to use it to stay in contact with
customers and manage e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier versions of Webbe started attracting users last year. To
Chambers' surprise, a large percentage of Webbe's 100,000 users are
in Italy. Even though the program is in English, Chambers said, it
appears to be popular in Italy because there are many small
Internet service providers and Webbe, being Web-based, can work
with all of them.
</P>
<P>
   A corporate version of the software, used mainly for instant
messaging, also has been sold to offices of Merrill Lynch and
members of the U.S. Navy Seals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a terrific tool,'' said Tom Donovan, an administrative
manager at Merrill Lynch in New York. ``It is used from senior vice
presidents down to support staff.''
</P>
<P>
   The inspiration for Webbe, Chambers said, was simple. Like many
users, he found himself increasingly frustrated by the
ever-widening gap between the Internet's bright promise and its
often dull delivery. He was fed up with computer screens filled
with useless information, mind-numbing redundancies and virtual
dead ends in his searches for meaningful data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just found it harder and harder to get the right information
at the right time,'' he said. Three years ago, he sat down in his
parents' home on Long Island, N.Y., and started writing lines of
code. In a few months, Chambers created Webbe, which not only
greatly simplified his Internet searches, he said, but helped him
to communicate more easily with friends and family online.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Chambers and his small company, Webbe Inc., of Long
Island, release Webbe 3.0, packed with new functions like on-line
gaming and drag-and-drop file transfer capabilities. (It is
available for free downloading at www.webbe.com.)
</P>
<P>
   Internet analysts are watching what some call the ``desktop
attention'' category that Webbe wants to occupy. Several years ago,
PointCast Network, one of the so-called push technologies, enjoyed
a surge of popularity and then suddenly fell out of favor.
</P>
<P>
   PointCast Inc. and Launchpad Technologies, major developers of
Internet and e-commerce tools, have combined to form Entrypoint
Inc. and recently produced EntryPoint 2.0, which does tasks similar
to Webbe's, although it lacks Webbe's instant-messaging features.
</P>
<P>
   There have been 2 million downloads of EntryPoint 2.0 since it
was released in the fall of 1999. But Chambers is undaunted. ``It
doesn't have robust communications,'' he said of EntryPoint.
</P>
<P>
   Being undaunted by challenge, even failure, has been a
consistent component of Chambers' personality, friends and
colleagues said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after he completed high school in Jamaica, where he
took some computer courses in a class of 50 students with four
aging computers, his parents decided to move the family to the
United States and settled in Hempstead on Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Suffering from culture shock, Chambers, a middle child, said he
decided not to go to college. (All of his six brothers and sisters
graduated from U.S. colleges and universities.) Instead, he
concentrated on developing software.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew about Gates and Jobs and I was just trying to outdo
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His parents helped him get a job running the computers for a
construction company in Brooklyn. On the job, he got an education
in what he called practical computing.
</P>
<P>
   (End Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   By late 1993, while still living at home, he began working to
create a touch-screen-based computer terminal called Movie Master
that could give video store customers instant access to
information, including short, on-screen video previews, on
videotapes available for rental. But the prototype failed to
interest the video rental industry.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just so disappointed,'' Chambers said. ``I had this
great product but couldn't get it to the people who needed to see
it.''
</P>
<P>
   He put Movie Master on the shelf and went to work on something
more modest, something he said he felt he could present to the
buying public without a lot of outside help.
</P>
<P>
   (End Optional Trim)
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 he introduced Power Quotes, a screen saver with
inspirational quotations, including the words of John F. Kennedy
and Martin Luther King Jr. The quotes would appear on the screen
along with music and images.
</P>
<P>
   The screen saver sold well, giving Chambers some breathing room
to start working on what would become Webbe, which was completed in
1998. The first person he shared it with was Rawle Howard, the
cousin of a friend.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin Optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `Man, this is the greatest thing I've ever
seen,''' recalled Howard. ```How can I get one?''' He said he had
no idea that Chambers had created the software. Three or four weeks
later, Howard, now the vice president of operations for Webbe,
received the first copy of the program.
</P>
<P>
   Looking back, Howard said he should not have been surprised. He
described Chambers as driven and said that he constantly sits in
front of his computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I'll come by and say let's go exercising, let's go
lift weights,'' Howard said. ``And he'll say: `No. The only thing
I'm lifting today is a mouse.'''
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In the next few months, Chambers said he hopes to lift the
profile of his fledgling company, and at the same time lift the
spirits of other living-room tinkerers who dare to do more than
just dream about success.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dreaming is only important,'' Chambers said, ``when you go and
act on it.''

 &HT;    MICROSOFT PUNISHMENT HEARING SET FOR NEXT MONTH
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge who ruled Monday that Microsoft
Corp. has broken the nation's antitrust laws set May 24 to hear how
the company and the government think it should be punished.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Wednesday with lawyers for both sides in the
landmark case, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson relented
from an earlier stand, allowing the Justice Department and the 19
states which joined forces two years ago to file their proposed
remedies separately if they could not agree on a common approach.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Jackson met with the attorneys, Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates drove by the federal courthouse on the way to the U.S.
Capitol for separate meetings with Republican and Democratic
lawmakers. Gates spent much of the afternoon with President Clinton
attending a White House economic conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gates blames hard-liners among the attorneys general for the
failure of settlement talks in which he took a highly active part.
The collapse prompted Jackson to quickly issue his scathing
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson placed the historic case, with the full approval of the
litigants, on a fast legal track. The Justice Department and the
states have until April 28 to file their proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is to reply by May 10, and the government is issue its
answer to Microsoft's views by May 17.
</P>
<P>
   That exchange will set the stage for the final courtroom drama
before the case is appealed, possibly directly to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could still seek a lengthier proceeding if the
government proposes ``something that was so radically different
than anything that somebody had talked about before,'' said David
Boies, the government's chief trial lawyer, according to a
transcript of the discussion in Jackson's chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My transcendent objective is to get this thing before an
appellate tribunal _ one or another _ as quickly as possible
because I don't want to disrupt the economy or waste any more of
yours or my time on a remedy if it's going to come back here,''
Jackson said at an earlier meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1974 law, the high tribunal can decide to hear a direct
appeal from the trial court decision in major antitrust cases
brought by the government.

 &HT;    MICROSOFT PUNISHMENT HEARING SET FOR NEXT MONTH
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The federal judge who ruled Monday that Microsoft
Corp. has broken the nation's antitrust laws set May 24 to hear how
the company and the government think it should be punished.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting Wednesday with lawyers for both sides in the
landmark case, U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson relented
from an earlier stand, allowing the Justice Department and the 19
states which joined forces two years ago to file their proposed
remedies separately if they could not agree on a common approach.
</P>
<P>
   Even as Jackson met with the attorneys, Microsoft Chairman Bill
Gates drove by the federal courthouse on the way to the U.S.
Capitol for separate meetings with Republican and Democratic
lawmakers. Gates spent much of the afternoon with President Clinton
attending a White House economic conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gates blames hard-liners among the attorneys general for the
failure of settlement talks in which he took a highly active part.
The collapse prompted Jackson to quickly issue his scathing
verdict.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson placed the historic case, with the full approval of the
litigants, on a fast legal track. The Justice Department and the
states have until April 28 to file their proposed remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft is to reply by May 10, and the government is issue its
answer to Microsoft's views by May 17.
</P>
<P>
   That exchange will set the stage for the final courtroom drama
before the case is appealed, possibly directly to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft could still seek a lengthier proceeding if the
government proposes ``something that was so radically different
than anything that somebody had talked about before,'' said David
Boies, the government's chief trial lawyer, according to a
transcript of the discussion in Jackson's chambers.
</P>
<P>
   ``My transcendent objective is to get this thing before an
appellate tribunal _ one or another _ as quickly as possible
because I don't want to disrupt the economy or waste any more of
yours or my time on a remedy if it's going to come back here,''
Jackson said at an earlier meeting on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a 1974 law, the high tribunal can decide to hear a direct
appeal from the trial court decision in major antitrust cases
brought by the government.

   &QL;  NEW ENGLAND LAWMAKERS CALL FOR HIGH-SPEED RAIL
</P>
<P>
   By Alex Canizares
</P>
<P>
   States News Service
</P>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, April 5 - A plan to extend high-speed train service
from Boston to Montreal that could cut in half commute times for
New Hampshire and Vermont residents who drive to Boston is being
pushed by New England lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The legislators, including Massachusetts Gov. Paul Cellucci and
both of the state's US senators, want to extend the 110
mile-per-hour train service already planned between Boston and New
York, through Lowell, Nashua, Manchester, Concord, Montpelier,
Burlington, to Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   An April 4 letter from Vermont Senator Jim M. Jeffords to
President Clinton and US Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater
argued that the heavily-populated area has become congested, and
urged them to upgrade tracks along the 330-mile stretch between
Boston and Montreal with federal highway funds.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our population density and a 150 percent increase in travel
throughout New England has combined to overwhelm traditional modes
of transportation in our region,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The rail would also allow passengers to use the Manchester
airport as an alternative to Logan Airport. ``Boston's Logan
Airport, the hub of the region's air traffic and one of the main
gateways for travelers to northern New England, is among the
nation's busiest,'' the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed extension would allow residents in southern New
Hampshire to cut their driving commute times to downtown Boston --
about four hours -- down to two hours, said Jeffords' legislative
director Ken Connolly. Passengers would be able to reach Montreal
in three hours.
</P>
<P>
   There is currently no passenger train service between
Massachusetts and Canada.
</P>
<P>
   The project would cost roughly $500 million, paid under 1998
legislation calling for the expansion of high-speed rail service
around the country. The project would entail building new tracks
between Concord and White River Juncture, Vermont, a stretch that
currently lacks any service.
</P>
<P>
   ``High speed rail service between Boston and Burlington will
bring significant economic and transportation benefits through New
England,'' Senator Edward Kennedy said Wednesday. ``We have already
made progress in linking Boston to New York City, and this proposal
is an important expansion of that effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak, whose Northeast Direct train from Boston to New York has
been delayed until later this year, would operate the new line.
</P>
<P>
   Representatives James McGovern of Worcester, and Martin Meehan
of Lowell, with Senator Robert C. Smith and Representative Charles
Bass, both Republicans of New Hampshire, and Vermont Independent
Bernard Sanders, also signed the letter.

FINDING HER WORKSTATION IN LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  (My Job column) 
 
 By SUSAN BARTERS With ROBERT WADDELL   
Ms. Barters is a customer service representative at Unum Provident,
a disability and life insurance company in New York. 
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ I live with multiple sclerosis, so when I roll into
work, my fellow employees sometimes have to tell me to slow down or
yell for people nearby to watch their toes. They raised my
workstation here, so that I can roll right in. I was given a
21-inch computer, and my printer is at my desk.
</P>
<P>
   And everyone is jealous.
</P>
<P>
   There are constant jokes. They make fun of me in the office, but
no one has ever crossed the line. We all work hard, and joking is
one way of getting through the day. They tell me I've got to get a
horn on that wheelchair and call me a daredevil menace. The horn
that I do have right now is kind of wimpy. I need something that
goes aoogaw! I've got a big mouth, and that works better.
</P>
<P>
   The business that I'm in is disability insurance. I've never had
anything really negative happen to me. I don't show fear or that
I'm different in any way. I just happen to be sitting. It comes
across to my boss, my co-workers and clients that I don't take guff
from anyone.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of our work at Unum Provident is that you're injured,
then you get back to work. I'm on the phone most of the time trying
to help people with billing or with changing their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Once this poor girl called. Her boyfriend had died, and she said
that his parents wanted to keep all of the money for themselves. I
tried to help her. It turned out her boyfriend had overdosed on
heroin, and she wanted money for her own drug problem. She kept
insisting that she was being swindled, but she wanted the money for
her own heroin addiction. I felt so sorry for her, but we don't pay
out if someone commits suicide.
</P>
<P>
   I probably talk to 100 people a day. I deal with brokers and
policyholders who have no idea of my disability. Sometimes people
get angry and start shouting at me and berating me. I always try to
remain composed, but once I just lost it. I shouted right back; the
conversation got pretty nasty. My manager heard part of it. She
didn't chew me out. She just told me that I had to maintain control
and not talk to my brokers that way. I got no special treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Once, before an open-enrollment meeting at a law firm, a woman
there said, ``You're not what I expected,'' and I said, ``You're
not what I expected either.'' Normally, you go to meetings, and
you're there to do your job, but with this woman, we seemed to
click. There was no guff. Even though I showed up in a wheelchair,
she saw past that. Unfortunately, the first thing that most people
see is the wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know if anyone would appreciate this story, but it is
kind of heart-warming to me. Last week, one of the bigwigs was
coming to our office in Manhattan. I was a little nervous, but she
turned out to be so down-to-earth that I thought to myself: ``If
these are the types of people running this company, then I know
that I'm not going anywhere else.'' &QL;

SPORTS COLUMN: RETOUCHES FOR GOLF'S MONA LISA 
</HEADLINE>
  (With GLF-MASTERS) 
 By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ If Cypress Point, out there with the surf and the
seals on the rocks of the Monterrey Peninsula in California, is
considered the Sistine Chapel of golf courses, Augusta National is
the Mona Lisa.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a true piece of art,'' said Jose Maria
Olazabal, who won the Masters last year for the second time. ``When
you have a great painting or whatever, you don't try to change much
on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Olazabal seemed to be quietly questioning the subtle retouching
on nine holes, mostly the gentle rough that has narrowed the
fairway landing areas, for the 64th Masters that starts Thursday
with the same story line whenever Tiger Woods is playing: can
anybody here beat him?
</P>
<P>
   But a great golf course _ even, if not especially, Augusta
National _ is as much a work in progress as a work of art.
</P>
<P>
   With all the high-tech changes in equipment and agronomy over
the years, name a famous golf course that hasn't made changes and
you'll find it is as outdated as the hickory shaft. And the Augusta
National green jackets, on the advice of the golf architect Tom
Fazio, have retouched the Mona Lisa again.
</P>
<P>
   But not everybody appreciates the retouching, beginning with
Jack Nicklaus, the six-time Masters winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``This golf course has always been played by the tree lines,''
said the Golden Bear, who has designed nearly 200 courses in 27
countries. ``I'm in favor of rough, but don't cut it in straight
lines that aren't along the tree lines. It looks like it's done by
someone who doesn't play golf or understand golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Harsh words for Fazio and the current green-jacket descendants
of Augusta National's original co-designers, the legendary Bobby
Jones and the worldwide architect Alister Mackenzie.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby Jones and Alister Mackenzie were great
designers,'' Mickelson said. ``I don't think it's the place of
anybody, if you can't break 90, to be changing the golf course from
those original designs.''
</P>
<P>
   Mickelson might be surprised to learn that those ``original
designs'' hardly exist now. After the first Masters in 1934, the
original front nine and back nine were reversed.
</P>
<P>
   If that switch had not been made, Gene Sarazen's legendary
double-eagle 2 in 1935 would have happened on the sixth hole
instead of the 15th hole, if it happened at all.
</P>
<P>
   In those early years, the greens were almost as hard as an
asphalt road. As Sam Snead remembers, ``When you walked across 'em,
you could hear your spikes.''
</P>
<P>
   After World War II, both the 11th and the 16th holes were
altered. On the 11th, now a par 4 of 455 yards, a pond was created
to the left of the green and a new tee was built in the pine trees
behind the 10th green.
</P>
<P>
   The 16th, originally a little par 3 of about 125 yards over a
meaningless ditch, was extended to what is now 170 yards over a
yawning pond to a slippery green.
</P>
<P>
   In 1974, the bunkers were filled with different sand. In 1981,
the greens were converted to bent grass from Bermuda grass.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, after more than 60 years of no discernible rough, what
Augusta National likes to call ``the second cut'' was grown _ one
and three-eighths inch of rough that's smoother than the fairways,
if not the greens, at some golf courses.
</P>
<P>
   And for this year's Masters, hoping to put a premium on driving
for Woods and golf's other big bombers, the green jackets narrowed
the landing areas on six holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt,'' said William (Hootie) Johnson, the Masters
chairman, ``that we could no longer let them swing from the heels.
We had to require more accuracy off the tee. If you're hitting a
sand wedge or a pitching wedge or no more than a 9-iron to almost
any green, then we have to call on some premium on accuracy off the
tee.''
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Woods and the other big bombers must be more
careful with their tee shots on the ninth and 10th holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``On No. 9,'' Woods said, ``now you have to go right of that big
tree, which means you can't hit to the middle of the fairway. The
middle has moved over 15 or 20 yards. On No. 10, a ball that used
to hang up on the fairway is now in the rough. Now there's a longer
shot from the rough to a green that is now harder and faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the changes just represent a little retouching for
golf's Mona Lisa, still a work in progress. Low score will still
win.

WRITERS AND THEIR SECRETS IN A VANISHED NEW YORK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, APRIL 9) 
</HEADLINE>
  Charles McGrath is the editor ot the New York Times Book Review and
was the deputy editor of The New Yorker 
 By CHARLES McGRATH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Joe Gould's Secret'' is an odd book to want to make a movie
of. It is a classic of sorts, by one of the most revered of the old
New Yorker writers, Joseph Mitchell; and until the book-length
version was republished recently by the Modern Library, copies of
the original magazine articles, bleary from over-Xeroxing, were
passed around in certain circles like samizdat.
</P>
<P>
   But the action, such as it is, is largely interior; ``Joe
Gould's Secret'' is sometimes called a ``writer's book,'' and not
without reason: it's a story that in part is (italics)about(end
italics) writing, a theme whose track record up on the screen is
not terribly encouraging. Think of those embarrassing scenes in
``Doctor Zhivago,'' with the crumpled papers littering the freezing
studio.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably, it was the very literariness and unfashionableness
of the story _ its serious, writerly aspect _ that appealed to
Stanley Tucci, who produced, directed and starred in ``Joe Gould's
Secret,'' which opened Friday. He and his screenwriter, Howard A.
Rodman, have created a film version that is earnest and intelligent
and, for the most part, painstakingly faithful to the facts.
</P>
<P>
   But the movie necessarily makes linear what in the written
version was double and circular, and in the process the story loses
some of its stereotypical quality, in the best sense of the word:
the depth of field generated by looking at the same thing twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe Gould'' is a kind of diptych _ two portraits, written 22
years apart, of the same person. Gould, or Professor Seagull, as he
was sometimes called, was a familiar figure in the Greenwich
Village of the '40s, a diminutive, shabby but well-spoken
panhandler who cadged money for drinks (``donations to the Joe
Gould Fund,'' he preferred to call it) by reciting poetry and
performing screeching sea gull imitations.
</P>
<P>
   In 1942, Mitchell, who had made a specialty of such characters _
gypsies, scam artists, sideshow performers: the odd, forlorn, and
often quite funny people who lived in the margins of New York then
_ published a famous profile of Gould in The New Yorker. This
article, which became the first part of the book, was a lively,
mostly cheerful piece, full of offbeat and colorful detail _ as
soundly constructed, William Maxwell writes in the book's
introduction, as a piece of carpentry: ``No hesitations. No bent
nails. Every word driven, so to speak, all the way into the wood.''
</P>
<P>
   The piece made a forceful case that Gould was more than your
run-of-the-mill eccentric; he was the author of an unfinished _ and
who knew, possibly great _ manuscript called ``An Oral History of
Our Time,'' a work of roughly nine million words, recording some
20,000 conversations, from people of all walks of life, that Gould
had overheard and faithfully transcribed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1964, seven years after his death, The New Yorker published
Mitchell's longer, two-part piece about Gould, who, it turned out,
had become an ongoing presence in Mitchell's life, a source of
guilt, annoyance and revisionist misgivings. From the very first
sentence, the tonality of the new piece was different _ slower,
darker, more meditative _ and the Gould who emerged was less a
``character'' than an almost tragic figure, whose life had been
filled with yearning and disappointment and self-thwarting.
</P>
<P>
   Readers learned much more about his background _ as the
disappointing son of a well-to-do Boston physician and as a
fish-out-of-water member of Harvard's class of 1916 _ and along the
way they learned more, too, about Mitchell and his own loneliness
and hesitations, his second thoughts about Gould. As Maxwell says,
this may be the first moment in magazine journalism when we see the
emergence of the reporter as human being.
</P>
<P>
   In a famous passage toward the end of the piece, Mitchell
reveals something he had suspected, but hadn't let on, two decades
before: that the ``Oral History'' was almost certainly a fraud,
consisting only of a few false starts and endlessly rewritten
passages that weren't conversations at all. And he goes on to say
that he understands just how it was that Gould could become half
convinced that this great work in fact existed _ because he,
Mitchell, had similarly deceived himself.
</P>
<P>
   For years, he says, he had been working in his head on a vast
autobiographical novel, a Joycean epic, about his own coming of age
in North Carolina and his subsequent wanderings in New York. ``But
the truth is,'' Mitchell says, ``I never actually wrote a word of
it. Time passed and I got caught up in other matters. Even so, for
several years I frequently daydreamed about it, and in those
daydreams I had finished writing it and it had been published and I
could see it. I could see its title page. I could see its binding,
which was green with gold lettering. Those recollections filled me
with almost unbearable embarrassment, and I began to feel more and
more sympathetic to Gould.''
</P>
<P>
   The book ends a few pages later, but most fans of Mitchell know
that there is an eerie and poignant coda: though Mitchell dutifully
went to his office at The New Yorker every day for the next 32
years, he never published another word.
</P>
<P>
   Gould is played in the movie by Ian Holm, who (though better
nourished) actually bears an uncanny resemblance to photographs of
the real Joe Gould. Holm gives a performance that is deliberately
understated at first but that slowly warms up, just as Gould did
after a few drinks. He resists the temptation to turn Gould into a
curiosity, at the cost sometimes of making you wonder just what was
the appeal of this tiresome, cranky little creature.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His big set piece, a party scene at which Gould does his famous
Chippewa Indian Dance, a sort of hopping, whooping striptease, is
more pathetic than it is riveting. On the other hand, when, toward
the end of the film, we see (as we don't in the book) an impassive,
well-scrubbed Gould living out his days, without an audience, at
Pilgrim State Hospital, out on Long Island, the effect is
heartbreaking.
</P>
<P>
   Stanley Tucci, who plays Mitchell, also bears a more than
passing resemblance to the original. He captures Mitchell's shyness
and dignity perfectly, and he, or his costume designer, has
recreated Mitchell's dapper wardrobe, down to the gray snap-brim
fedora he wore every day, rain or shine. Tucci even makes a game,
if inconsistent, stab at Mitchell's North Carolina accent; he's got
the vowels right, but not the syrupy rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   What he fails to evoke is Mitchell's soulfulness and his
avidity, the way, when he was excited, words burst from him in
elaborate free-flow patterns that didn't always assemble themselves
into sentences. Mitchell's curiosity was more than polite or
professional; it was passionate and even, at times, a little needy.
</P>
<P>
   Tucci's Mitchell is a businessman-journalist, and there are a
couple of lame scenes of him with his wife and daughters to
establish what a regular, family-man sort of fellow he is. The real
Mitchell was a family man, but he was also a loner, a cheerfully
melancholy figure who identified with the marginal people he wrote
about; he saw himself as one of them.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to have known Mitchell to appreciate this. It's
there in the writing. But this interior dimension seldom registers
in the movie. Mitchell is less a participant in the story than an
observer; when he confesses his own Gouldishness, he does so almost
offhandedly, to a stranger at a cocktail party, and the moment is
both unprompted and a little embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
   Where the movie does succeed, brilliantly at times, is in
recreating the Greenwich Village of the '40s, back when the Village
really was a village. The exterior shots are so well-chosen and so
evocative that you wish the movie's budget had allowed for more of
them, and for more period automobiles. (Granted, it was easy to
find a parking space back then, but surely there were more than
three or four cars to a block.)
</P>
<P>
   The legendary hangouts are all here _ Goody's, the Minetta
Tavern, the Vanguard; and the movie's two big party scenes capture
the fluid, eclectic nature of bohemian life back then. It was a
place where the ``cranks and misfits and one-lungers,'' as Gould
called them, mingled freely with genuine artists, the poets and
painters and sculptors, not to mention the wannabes and the
poseurs, and with the intellectuals, the sexually curious and
adventurous, and the precocious, thrill-seeking college kids.
</P>
<P>
   Watching ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' you immediately understand why
Mitchell was so drawn to this world, and at the same time you're
wistfully aware of how bygone it all seems. There are no margins in
New York anymore, or at least none as benign and capacious as those
the Village used to provide.
</P>
<P>
   In its poignancy the movie even offers a clue as to why Mitchell
stopped publishing: by the time Gould died, in 1957, the old,
bohemian Village was already on its last legs, and so, too, were
Mitchell's other beloved haunts, the New York harborfront and the
farms and swamps of Staten Island.
</P>
<P>
   The places he loved and felt at home in had ceased to exist, and
like Joe Gould, Joe Mitchell found himself drawn to the world of
memory. When he died, in May 1996, he was still working on the very
book he had daydreamed, the Joycean epic about the young Tarheel in
the big city.  &QL;

   Finally, a Yoga Journal essay about the convergence of yoga and
tango notes, ``In tango, two strangers meet and, within seconds, if
the alchemy is right, explore the intimate wrestle of desire, the
tension between dominance and submission. And when at last they
surrender as one, their pelvises pressed together ... the struggle
is over. In that moment, the Zen of tango awakens. ... A sweaty
little tango parlor can become a sacred space where one can dance
through memories and karma.''

&HT;     GORE STEPS UP ATTACKS ON BUSH'S EDUCATION AND TAX PLANS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By AUSTIN ZALKIN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Al Gore stepped up his attacks on George W. Bush's
education and tax policies Wednesday before an enthusiastic labor
union crowd here.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president charged that the Texas governor's education
proposals would not lower class sizes or help rebuild schools that
are falling apart and that his planned tax cuts would create
spending deficits.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing a cheering audience at the Construction and Building
Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, Gore called Bush's tax plan a
``reckless scheme that (would) devastate public schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line of his plan is a return to the Bush-Quayle
deficits,'' he said, referring to the administration of President
George Bush, the candidate's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``We face an opportunity to build on today's prosperity, use it
</P>
<P>
   to make sure no one is left behind, or to choose the other
</P>
<P>
   direction, which would mean a right-wing U-turn back to the
</P>
<P>
   Bush-Quayle deficits, the Bush-Quayle recession, the Bush-Quayle
</P>
<P>
   assault on working families,'' Gore declared.
</P>
<P>
   Repeating his earlier attacks, Gore criticized Gov. Bush's
record on education in Texas, saying the Lone Star State rates 45th
in the nation in SAT scores and 48th in the percentage of high
school students who finish college.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says he wants to do for the nation's schools what he's done
for the schools in Texas,'' Gore added sarcastically.
</P>
<P>
   The attacks followed the release of a Washington Post-ABC News
poll Tuesday that showed 48 percent of Americans say Gore is the
candidate better able to improve public education while 39 percent
claim Bush is better.
</P>
<P>
   The Bush campaign replied to Gore's speech with an attack on the
Clinton-Gore administration's record on education.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al Gore's rhetoric of bringing revolutionary change to our
nation's schools rings hollow,'' said Bush spokesman Scott
McClellan. ``Texas is leading the nation in closing the achievement
gap (between minority and non-Hispanic white students) while the
Clinton-Gore administration has done nothing in closing the
achievement gap.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement released Wednesday, Bush asked Gore why 68
percent of children in the nation's poorest schools cannot read and
why America lags behind other industrial nations in certain
international test scores.
</P>
<P>
   McClellan also accused Gore of distorting Bush's tax plan
figures and his record on education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's education plan calls for $115 billion in federal spending
over 10 years in part to hire new teachers and help districts build
new schools and rebuild old ones.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has proposed holding poorly performing schools accountable
by shutting them down and later reopening them with new
administrators and with teachers who have received new training. He
would also reward successful teachers with higher salaries.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's plan, which he amended last week to boost federal funds,
now calls for $13.4 billion in federal spending over five years.
About $3 billion would go to recruiting and training new teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Bush would hold schools accountable for students' success on
standardized tests by permanently closing poorly performing schools
and making available money to low-income parents who could then
enroll their children in private schools. Gore opposes the
private-school voucher idea.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has often boasted about the accountability standards he
oversees as Texas governor that have raised standardized test
scores among minority students in the state. His critics have noted
that many of the standards were already in place or had been
proposed before Bush took office in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, citing their differences, said of Bush's education plan:
</P>
<P>
   ``He's wrong on rebuilding public schools, wrong on small class
sizes, wrong on universal pre-school, wrong on teacher quality and
accountability.'' Gore added that Bush also is ``wrong on a tax
giveaway for the few at the expense of education and health care
and a strong economy.''
</P>
<P>
   McClellan, however, argued that Bush's tax cut would save $2
trillion for Social Security and preserve the budget surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is proposing a $483 billion tax-cut package over five
years, and Gore supports the $250 billion net tax cut over 10 years
that President Clinton outlined in his State of the Union address
in January.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the summer of 1926, Joseph Moncure March,
something of a rebel at 26, sat down at a battered kitchen table in
his airless $20-a-month walkup in Manhattan to write a narrative in
verse about ``a lot of people getting drunk at a party,'' a subject
he had come to know very well.
</P>
<P>
   The result, ``The Wild Party,'' is, as almost everyone knows by
now, the source and title of two musicals this season: one, by
Andrew Lippa, ends its run this Sunday at the Manhattan Theater
Club at City Center; the other, co-produced by the Joseph Papp
Public Theater, is to open on Thursday at the Virginia Theater on
Broadway. With music and lyrics by Michael John LaChiusa and
directed by George C. Wolfe, it stars Mandy Patinkin, Toni Collette
and Eartha Kitt.
</P>
<P>
   No era is so fully identified with its parties (and no parties
seem to have been wilder) than the Jazz Age, a period that comes
down to us as one decadelong, tinseled, alcohol-saturated
celebration. March's poem offers a jolting peek at the hard-driving
pursuit of illicit pleasure, the intoxicated throwing off of
inhibitions and the thrill of getting down and dirty.
</P>
<P>
   Great parties can reveal a lot about an era, its moods, the
character of its gaiety, its resources for pleasures and for the
ability to suspend ordinary life, from Nero's notorious excesses to
the dizzying sexual undercurrents of 19th-century balls captured by
Flaubert in ``Madame Bovary.''
</P>
<P>
   As Truman Capote's 1966 Black and White Ball marks and comments
on its historical moment, the '70s are forever linked to the
cocaine-charged parties at Studio 54.
</P>
<P>
   March's ``Wild Party'' is a tale about the dangers _ and the
frisson _ of crossing boundaries and of a restless pursuit of the
forbidden. It tells the racy story of an all-night debauch in the
bohemian squalor of the Manhattan apartment of a vaudeville dancer,
Queenie, and her swaggering boyfriend, Burrs. When Black _ a man
who ``made you think of squash-rackets;/ And dinner-jackets./ And
had that air of poise without pose/That only a well-bred person
shows'' _ turns up to mix with the exotic lowlife, Queenie makes
her move on him, and the results are deadly.
</P>
<P>
   The plot owes something to the ballad form and to the words of
blues songs and African-American ``toasts,'' while the poem's tone
veers between stark tabloid luridness and street-talk patter: ``
`Listen to me, kid!' Kate admonished:/ `Keep away from that
blond-headed vamp:/ She was wise to herself/ When your ears were
damp!'''
</P>
<P>
   The writer of these words was a New Yorker, born in 1899 into an
established, powerful family. He described feeling unnerved when,
as an undergraduate attending Amherst College's compulsory daily
chapel, he was seated beneath a portrait of his grandfather, an
Anglo-Saxon scholar and philologist who had received honorary
degrees from Princeton, Columbia, Oxford and Cambridge.
</P>
<P>
   March's uncle, Gen. Peyton Conway March, served as Army chief of
staff in World War I. His father, whom March described in a 1968
autobiographical essay as ``an imposing figure, 6 feet 6, 190
pounds, with black burly eyebrows,'' ran the legal department of
the Equity Life Insurance Co. These forebears, who took very solemn
approaches to their manly pursuits, would loom large in March's
consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   In that same essay, titled ``A Certain Wildness,'' March
described himself in the mid-1920s: ``A tense, somber young man, 6
feet 2 inches tall, weighing 148 pounds, with high cheekbones, a
slanting forehead, blackish-brown hair, a jutting nose much too big
for the rest of my face, and dark shadows under my eyes, which gave
me a dissipated look.'' His hats were by Knox and he carried a
walking stick.
</P>
<P>
   March grew up on West 112th Street before being packed off to
prep school at Lawrenceville in New Jersey, where he was
alphabetically seated beside Reginald Marsh, who would later
illustrate the first edition of ``The Wild Party,'' and at whose
home March would meet his second wife, Susan Wise.
</P>
<P>
   At Lawrenceville, March began writing poetry, and at Amherst he
studied with Robert Frost, whom he described as ambling the campus
``with the uncertain gait of a man who was slightly tipsy, or
perhaps walking in his sleep ... his gray suit looking like he had
slept in it all summer.'' Frost's ``unpretty'' diction,
disparagement of free verse and unconventional rhyme patterns
became reference points for March in writing ``The Wild Party.''
</P>
<P>
   At college, March's uneasy truce with the establishment was made
even more difficult after he wrote two articles criticizing school
policy and spoofing the rhetorical style of a minister. In hot
water with the dean, he halfheartedly apologized, then packed his
bags and headed for New York, enlisting in the Army the next day.
He served a year in France as a private in the artillery, making no
use of his connections: ``My family regarded nepotism with
disfavor,'' he wrote later.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, he finished up at Amherst and made his way to New
York the same year as F. Scott Fitzgerald and just in time for the
Roaring Twenties.
</P>
<P>
   Recalling them years later, Fitzgerald said he had ``gone to New
York on a terrible party,'' and the epigraph to his 1922 novel,
``This Side of Paradise'' _ ``The victor belongs to the spoils'' _
could serve as one for the decade.
</P>
<P>
   The New York to which March returned, pumped up by the postwar
Wall Street boom, swarmed with a prosperous crowd bent on nocturnal
diversion. Prohibition pushed pleasure into the realm of the
illicit and seemed to provoke experiments in misbehavior.
</P>
<P>
   Speakeasies and nightclubs multiplied, as partying became big
business for bootleggers and club owners. Cafe society came into
routine contact with mobsters. For the well heeled, rubbing
shoulders with people ``out of one's set'' was itself a highly
charged act of defiance of respectability. And slumming _
selective, pleasure-oriented contact with a colorful low-life,
homosexuals and ``the race'' _ became a pastime of the rich. The
romantic possibilities of transgression seemed inexhaustible; all
lines demanded crossing: racial, class, gender and legal.
</P>
<P>
   While Upper East Side clubs like the Heigh-Ho excluded blacks
and Jews, and blacks could enter many Broadway clubs only as
entertainers or hired help, white patrons were making nightly
pilgrimages to Harlem, which had displaced the bohemian Greenwich
Village as the city's nocturnal nerve center.
</P>
<P>
   Harlem clubs like Jungle Alley, Small's Paradise, Connie's Inn,
Tillie's Chicken Shack and the Cotton Club presented such talent as
Fats Waller, Ethel Waters, Bessie Smith and Duke Ellington.
Audiences included many ``downtown'' musicians like Paul Whiteman,
Hoagy Carmichael, Bix Beiderbecke and Benny Goodman, and
celebrities like Tallulah Bankhead, Joan Crawford, Mae West, Jack
Dempsey, Gene Tunney and Lady Mountbatten.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a column devoted to nightclubs and carrying the signature
``Lipstick,'' The New Yorker instructed those heading uptown that
the area did not really heat up until 5 in the morning.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the wealthy prowlers of the gaslit Victorian night world,
affluent women of the 1920s went along for the ride. H.L. Mencken's
American Mercury, reporting on gin in 1927, wrote that 10 years
before then, ``no virtuous white woman in all this Christian realm
ever tasted it.'' The article continued, ``But now it is the common
beverage of American youth, and the daughters of the white
``noblesse'' carry it to parties as they used to carry smelling
salts.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Broadway theater buzzed to the electricity of the risque.
Along with Eugene O'Neill's ``Desire Under the Elms'' and Cole
Porter and Gershwin musicals, there were shows like ``Naughty
Cinderella,'' ``The Unchastened Woman'' and ``Is Zat So?,'' about
the world of prizefighters. Prostitution was explored in ``Shanghai
Gesture,'' ``Lulu Belle'' and Mae West's ``Sex.'' And homosexuality
was openly treated in ``The Captive'' and ``The Virgin Man,'' which
Mayor Jimmy Walker attended on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   March's New York life was a fluid one and he moved easily
between worlds. He even served briefly in 1925 as the first
managing editor of The New Yorker, all the while feeling himself to
be a writer who was not writing. Meanwhile, he plunged into the
nightlife.
</P>
<P>
   In his autobiographical essay, March describes one Greenwich
Village soiree where the host quietly hanged himself in the
bathroom; at another, a friend filled a lull by jumping from a
fourth-story window to a neighboring roof: ``For a split second I
thought he wasn't going to make it,'' March wrote. ``He grinned at
us amiably, then crouched and sprang back to the window.''
</P>
<P>
   A five-year marriage to a woman he describes as a ``Vassar
intellectual'' ended in 1926, and he took up with a tall
good-looking blonde: ``We had nothing in common except boredom, and
spent most of our time ... drifting from party to party and
drinking compulsively.'' Soon out of money, he gave up his tasteful
apartment on Gay Street to begin work on ``The Wild Party,'' his
father staking him to $30 a week.
</P>
<P>
   The poem took March three months, an entire hot summer, to
write: ``On good days, I would be able to do as much as 10 lines;
on bad days, I was lucky to get four. Once in a while, the lines
would seem just right as I set them down, but that was rare.
Generally, I had to work the passage over and over until it was the
way I wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   But in his ``improvised'' cadences he felt he had stumbled onto
a ``new beat,'' and he was elated. He later described the influence
of silent film on the poem: ``My school for storytelling was the
cinema. I had sat in theaters watching films like `The Last Laugh'
and `Variety' over and over again, admiring their tremendous pace
and economy, and the way the swift succession of images on the
screen kept the story moving without any let-down.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite enthusiasm from literary critics, including the
influential Louis Untermeyer, it took March two years to find a
publisher. Richard Simon of Simon &AMP; Schuster was scared off by a
letter from the head of the New York Society for Suppression of
Vice, threatening to jail him if he published the piece.
</P>
<P>
   Finally brought out in 1928 in a tiny edition of 750 copies by
Covici, the poem became an underground sensation, was banned in
Boston and went through a number of private printings in Germany
and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But March's next work, ``The Set-Up,'' the story in verse of a
black prizefighter, inspired by Jack Johnson, who is destroyed by
corruption and racial prejudice, brought him more conventional
success. It made the New York Times best-seller list and was later
adapted for the screen _ but with a white protagonist.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, March found his way to Hollywood, where he
wrote screenplays and met his third wife, Peggy Pryor, whom he
married in 1931. His first movie, ``Hell's Angels,'' featured Jean
Harlow, the Blonde Bombshell, as an upscale Queenie, a scantily
clad pre-Hayes-code vamp, and it made her a star. His roster of
films includes ``Madame Butterfly,'' with Cary Grant as Pinkerton;
``Journey's End,'' a war drama, and ``Three Faces West,'' a
melodrama starring John Wayne.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941 he returned east, worked on documentaries for the State
Department and wrote feature stories for The New York Times
Magazine, mostly about Hollywood. He ended his career writing
industrial films for General Motors and Ford.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps March found and lost himself in the 1920s. His wayward
spirit discovered its most fertile ground then, and if he ever
returned to writing narrative verse, we have no trace of it yet. In
1968 he wrote: ``My own preference has always been for the
disreputable. I feel much more at home in a pool parlor or a
nightclub than I do in a church; walking on the sunny side of the
street makes me quite ill, and even entering the lobby of a place
like the University Club will give me a qualm of apprehension and
nausea.'' He died in Los Angeles in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   As for these two productions of ``The Wild Party'' _ have they
something to tell us about our own era? Where are the wild parties
of today? How wild do parties get in our smoke-free, nonalcoholic,
decaffeinated, nonsexually harassing, Prozac-medicated world?
Perhaps they are not to be found in the dark depths of night but in
buoyant afternoons on the stock exchange floor. (af)

IRAN SAYS IT SEIZED SHIP WITH SMUGGLED IRAQ OIL
</HEADLINE>
  By BARBARA CROSSETTE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Two weeks after the United States warned that
increased oil smuggling from Iraq could not be stopped without
Iran's help, the Iranian government said Wednesday that it had
seized a tanker illegally exporting Iraqi oil as it passed through
Iranian waters.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian national news agency said that revolutionary guards
boarded an Iraqi ship flying under a Honduran flag on Saturday. The
ship was reported to be carrying 2,500 tons of smuggled oil. The
Iranian agency said the ship and its captain and crew were in
Iranian custody.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the reports are true, we are pleased to see that Iran is
taking measures against this illegal traffic,'' a spokesman for the
State Department, James Rubin, said Wednesday. Rubin said the
United States had not confirmed the arrest, which follows more than
18 months during which Iran allowed what U.S. officials say is
significant growth in the illegal coastal trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, Iran has taken measures to halt smuggling along
its coast, and we hope this is an indication they intend to do so
vigorously again,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   On March 23, Vice Adm. Charles Moore, the U.S. coordinator of an
international fleet that patrols the Persian Gulf off Iraq and
intercepts illegal shipments, told the Security Council sanctions
committee on Iraq that oil smuggling had increased significantly
since the fall, with much of the trade beginning in Iranian coastal
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Moore told the committee that a diplomatic or political overture
to Iraq was needed and that the smuggled Iraqi oil _ most of it
gasoil, similar to diesel fuel _ went to a variety of countries
including Iran, as well as to Pakistan and India. Recently, two
Thais and a Singaporean were charged in a court in California with
trying to buy Iraqi oil, apparently for shipment to Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Pentagon officials told the sanctions panel that with high oil
prices Iraq could earn more than $1 billion in illegal sales this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Under Security Council sanctions imposed in 1990 after Iraq
invaded Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein's government is not only
prohibited from selling oil without U.N. supervision, but it is
also barred from refining oil, as it has to do to produce gasoil.
</P>
<P>
   Since December, Iraq has been allowed to sell as much crude oil
as it wants, with profits going to a U.N. escrow account to pay for
food, medicines and equipment for a range of public services. A
third of the money goes to compensate victims of the Kuwait
invasion.
</P>
<P>
   In another sanctions dispute, U.S. officials considered
Wednesday how to respond to an illegal flight into Baghdad by an
Italian plane that was taking anti-sanctions campaigners to Iraq.
All flights to Iraq have to seek approval from the sanctions
committee.
</P>
<P>
   The pilot of the small Italian passenger plane left Jordan
Tuesday saying that he was going to Syria and then turned and flew
at a very low altitude into Iraq. On board were, in addition to the
pilot, an Italian businessman, identified by the Jordanians as
Nicola Grauso; a member of the European Parliament, Vittori Sgarbi;
and a French priest, the Rev. Jean-Marie Benjamin. When the plane
returned to Jordan Wednesday, it was intercepted, forced to land
and impounded.
</P>
<P>
   The businessmen were allowed to leave Amman by commercial
flights, but the pilot was detained. The priest, who had campaigned
against sanctions, remained in Baghdad, the Jordanians said.
</P>
<P>
   In Baghdad, the group said the flight had been deliberately
planned to break the air embargo. Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
called the flight a ``noble and courageous initiative.''

<P>
   President Clinton turned to Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates on
Wednesday and asked him how the nation could encourage ``more
billionaires'' like him to take a stand.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton was not talking about the Gates who has dug in his
heels in a legal battle with the federal government. Instead, he
was talking about the Gates who co-founded a charity that has
quickly vaulted to the top of the world's philanthropy charts.
</P>
<P>
   The setting was the East Room of the White House, where Clinton
had convened a day-long conference on the challenges and
opportunities posed by the ``new economy'' of the information age.
</P>
<P>
   As both men listened to a speech by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan, Clinton gave Gates several friendly pats on the
back.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gates, seated to the president's immediate right, joined an
afternoon panel on ``Closing the Global Divide'' along with other
luminaries such as World Bank President James Wolfensohn.
</P>
<P>
   In a question-and-answer session after the panel discussion,
Clinton cited philanthropists from an earlier era such as Andrew
Carnegie, J.P. Morgan, and John D. Rockefeller, who, he said,
``great monuments to our culture -- the great museums, the great
public, the great libraries.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The information technology revolution has created more
billionaires in America in less time than ever before. And we have
just scads of people worth a couple hundred million dollars, which
to people like me is real money,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have all these young people who have made a lot of
money,'' he went on. Turning to the world's richest man, he asked,
What can we do to see that there are more efforts like the one
you're making?''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very good question,'' Gates replied. I think about it a
lot.''
</P>
<P>
   But he did not have any ready answers, other than allowing that
``as I learn more (about giving), I get more excited myself.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Philanthropy, if it is done the right way, can have a
tremendous impact,'' said Gates, whose Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation focuses on ways to help to improve peoples' lives
through health and learning. ``It's a full-time job. I need to
think about that some more.''
</P>
<P>
   There was no apparent exchange between the two men about
Monday's ruling by a federal judge in a case brought by Clinton's
Justice Department that Microsoft had violated antitrust laws,
harming consumers by stifling competition and innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton left briefly, leaving Gates to chat amiably at
the break with another attendee, Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.
</P>
<P>
   He told the cabinet officer that ``unlike United Nations, who
have to defend themselves whatever they do in the developing world,
whether it works or not, we are free to spend $50 million and admit
we made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   In his formal remarks to the panel, Gates said the ``technology
revolution has been one of the greatest job creation engines ever''
and will lead to ``breakthroughs that will allow computers to
listen, to learn, to be in a tablet form connected up to a wireless
network that you just carry around with you.''
</P>
<P>
   When the session ended, Gates and his small traveling party were
escorted to a private White House elevator, the first step on a
trip back to Seattle on a Microsoft jet.

   MARKET-TRADERS (New York) _ At high noon Tuesday, after a rocky
morning of trading, U.S. stocks pitched into a 90-minute freefall.
By the time the dive ended, shares in some of the market's biggest
and most important companies, from technology leaders like Yahoo to
corporate titans like General Electric, had fallen 5, 10 or even 15
percent. There was no news bulletin to explain the decline, no mad
rumor of presidential ill health war in Asia, only a tidal wave of
selling. Then, just as quickly, the market turned, and many stocks
finished the day close to where they began or even up slightly. So
what happened? What happened, professional traders said, is that
the U.S. markets have become bigger, more volatile, and more
uncontrollable than ever before. By Alex Berenson.

   AREZZO, Italy _ The Pieros are back.
</P>
<P>
   After 15 years of arduous, costly and high-tech restoration, the
scaffolding has come down in the Church of San Francesco, providing
a dramatic new look at one of the art world's splendors, the fresco
cycle ``Legend of the True Cross'' by the Renaissance master Piero
della Francesca, called simply Piero by his many fans hereabouts.
</P>
<P>
   The dozen 15th-century paintings on plaster are being reopened
to the public on Friday in this medieval Tuscan city with a gala
celebration attended by President Carlo Azeglio Ciampi. Local
officials in particular hope the restored frescos will bring
expanded tourism and cultural dividends.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Arezzo, a backdrop for last year's Oscar-winning
film ``Life Is Beautiful,'' the beneficiaries could include
Sansepolcro, Piero's hometown, where the ancient art of lacemaking
is still taught; Anghiari, the site of a decisive 15th-century
battle won by the Florentines; Caprese Michelangelo, where
Michelangelo was born; and Citerna, an ancient Roman town where
local authorities want to revive arts like goldsmithing and
pottery.
</P>
<P>
   Promoting Piero as a kind of celebrity, albeit one whose
personal life remains sketchy (apart from several sly
self-portraits and a historically resonant death date: Oct. 12,
1492), may not be that far-fetched. Rising museumgoing has raised
art literacy, some art experts here say, but only in recent decades
has Piero been getting his due. His family house in Sansepolcro was
bought by the government for use as a museum in 1975. Since then
Piero has overtaken contemporaries like Domenico Veneziano, Fra
Angelico, Andrea Mantegna and Paolo Uccello to become the
15th-century artist whom people most often name as their favorite,
said Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, an art history professor at Princeton
University who was a consultant on the fresco restoration project.
</P>
<P>
   His unsparing hook-nosed profile of a red-clad count of Urbino,
Federico da Montefeltro, at the Uffizi in Florence, has become an
icon of the Renaissance. Piero is believed to have slipped several
vigorous self-portraits into his works, one as an awe-struck
worshiper under the protective cloak of the towering Madonna in his
``Misericordia Altarpiece'' and another as a sleeping Roman soldier
in ``The Resurrection of Christ,'' both on view in Sansepolcro. He
is also believed to have used his mother as the model for a rare
pregnant Virgin in his ``Madonna del Parto'' on display in
Monterchi, his mother's hometown. Although his paintings can also
be found in London, Milan and Urbino, it is here in the church's
chancel that sometime between 1452 and 1466 he created ``The Legend
of the True Cross,'' regarded as his masterpiece. The cycle of
frescoes illustrate a fanciful medieval narrative, a unified-field
theory of Christianity that traces the wood of the cross from Adam
and Eve in the Garden of Eden through episodes of the Old and New
Testaments. Sweepingly executed on wet plaster as vividly as a
Cecil B. De Mille epic, the paintings are hauntingly
representational _ Piero was a pioneer of perspective _ and coolly
abstract, foreshadowing Cubism and Impressionism and influencing,
scholars say, Cezanne and Seurat.
</P>
<P>
   Time has enhanced his reputation, but it has not been gentle
with his works. During Napoleon's occupation of the region in the
early 1800s, French troops quartered in the Arezzo church fired
shots that chipped the frescoes. The changing climate, natural
disasters and air pollution have also taken their toll.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million Piero Project rivaled in complexity the recent
cleaning and conservation of Michelangelo's frescos on the ceiling
of the Sistine Chapel in Rome. It was underwritten by the Banca
Popolare dell'Etruria e del Lazio, a modern Medici of art
philanthropy that has sponsored other major conservation projects.
The first six years were devoted to a study of the ``True Cross''
cycle, including damage done by earlier restorations, including the
injection of liquid cement into the walls, which caused paint to
flake off and sections of plaster to turn to chalk dust.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything that could happen, happened to these frescos of
Piero,'' said Anna Maria Maetzke, who oversaw the project as
superintendent of Arezzo's art treasures, bemoaning five centuries
of earthquakes, lightning strikes and manmade disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The restoration was noteworthy for its use of computer
re-creations and modern chemical technology, said Maetzke and
others involved in the project. The process clarified which
sections had been painted by less accomplished apprentices.
</P>
<P>
   Under patient washings with de-ionized water, long-hidden stars
were coaxed out of a luminous predawn sky above a sleeping Emperor
Constantine where an angel, astonishingly foreshortened, hurtles
out of the heavens. A colossal fabrication was uncovered in the
form of a Roman ruin that a well-meaning earlier restorer had
mistakenly conjured out of patchy sections of sky.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the restoration, the floor of the church was
perforated in a honeycomb pattern for better circulation of air,
and the outer walls were plastered for better insulation.
</P>
<P>
   The effort was so intense, wrote Silvano Lazzeri, the chief
conservator, in a bank-sponsored compendium of articles on the
project, that ``if I should ever find myself on a remote island in
the middle of the ocean, I reckon I'd be able to reconstruct, in my
mind's eye, all the scenes of the cycle.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the restoration say that such intervention risks
contaminating masterworks. On the other hand, Vittorio Sgarbi, a
prominent Italian art pundit and a member of Parliament, said that
the effort might have been too timid in stopping short of
recreating lost segments that could easily be established in the
context of the fresco. He also said that the costs of the project
may have ballooned because of the resources of the sponsoring bank.
</P>
<P>
   Italy has so many priceless treasures that selecting what to
conserve and restore takes political and commercial overtones as
sponsors vie for projects that will provide maximum publicity while
needier or worthier causes may go begging.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But for all-round popular appeal, the Piero Project would be
hard to top.
</P>
<P>
   Piero's birth in Sansepolcro to a prosperous family of
leathermakers and indigo merchants, probably between 1410 and 1420,
seems to have gone unrecorded. By 1436 he was studying painting
under a local master, Antonio d'Anghiari, and by 1450 he was
carrying out commissions as far afield as Venice. At the same time
he held office as a religious lay leader and consul in Sansepolcro
and studied mathematics, which led to three groundbreaking works in
arithmetic, geometry and perspective. He was assisting a Florentine
master, Lorenzo di Bicci, in painting the frescos in Arezzo when
Bicci fell ill and died, bequeathing the job to Piero.
</P>
<P>
   His method, the restorers confirmed, was to prepare a sketch on
heavy paper, attach it to the wet plaster wall, perforate the
outlines of the drawing with pinholes and then slap the paper with
coal dust to leave marks on the wall, a technique called spolvero.
Then with surprising speed, and nary a correction, Piero daubed in
the slabs of color and modeled the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Wet sacks were placed against the wall to keep the plaster damp.
After the plaster dried, he sometimes added fat-based colors, which
some scholars had wrongly assumed was the work of earlier
restorers. When apprentices took over, for example, in a grim
sequence depicting the torture of Judas, they cast the shadows in
the wrong direction.
</P>
<P>
   How long it took to complete the original work is not clear, but
Piero inherited the job in 1452 and the cycle was finished by 1466,
according to documents recently discovered by Professor James R.
Banker of North Carolina State University. Piero, who had created
other masterworks in the meantime and went on to produce yet more,
went blind in the 1480s, the Renaissance chronicler Vasari relates.
He died on what Americans regard as Columbus Day, one of the few
verifiable facts of his life. An excavation at a Sansepolcro church
in 1956 unearthed a tall skeleton that may be his.
</P>
<P>
   Today ``the Piero trail'' has become a tourist draw in a region
known for its walled cities, verdant hills, robust cuisine and
hearty wines. The ``Madonna del Parto'' with its plethora of
explanatory exhibits in Monterchi receives up to 50,000 visitors a
year, officials said. Piero executed the work in seven days _
``like God,'' said Nicola Laneri, an archaeologist working on
tourism programs.
</P>
<P>
   Among the visitors to Monterchi recently were two Americans,
Kaaren Plant of Chicago and her sister, Marcia Jackson of
Indianapolis, who stood in a darkened room reverently viewing the
delicate images of the blue-clad Madonna and two attending angels,
their restored faces also bearing the scars of bullet holes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We kept passing it by four years ago and it was never open,''
Plant said.
</P>
<P>
   In nearby Sansepolcro, meanwhile, the authorities commonly leave
a window of the museum open so that passersby can glimpse the
master's ``Resurrection of Christ'' on an opposite wall. ``Piero is
always present in town,'' said Paula Cardelli, cultural counselor
for the municipality. ``We call him `friendly Piero.'''

ON THE STREETS OF PHILADELPHIA WITH TONY GOLDMAN
</HEADLINE>
 By BARBARA FLANAGAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ If hype were an art form, Tony Goldman might have
won a Pulitzer by now. And if Pritzker prizes were awarded not for
boutique architecture, but for turning seedy buildings into
world-class destinations, then Goldman would surely be on the short
list.
</P>
<P>
   Most real estate mavens do not mess with losing propositions,
but this developer loves them. So far, Goldman, a trustee for the
National Trust for Historic Preservation, claims to have saved SoHo
in Manhattan (in the late '70s); South Beach in Florida (in the
mid-80s); and Wall Street (in the mid-90s). Now, he has plans to
recycle Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   What he sees is an infinitely walkable town with nothing to walk
to. Goldman has every intention of lifting the curse off
Philadelphia, a shrinking city of 1.5 million, semi-famous for
greasy food, high taxes, a surfeit of bricks, a dearth of style and
a lack of news.
</P>
<P>
   In five years, Goldman says, Philadelphia could be the Paris of
the Northeast, a town of affordable, comfy live and work quarters,
bustling with so much alfresco dining and strolling that people
would actually make Philadelphia the kind of destination that South
Beach has become. Without the beach, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, 56, who is based in Manhattan, likes to discover
once-flourishing neighborhoods, buy them up cheaply (his buying
spree in Philadelphia happened two years ago) and then nurture them
over a decade or two. While other developers tend to bulldoze
defunct, outmoded buildings, Goldman likes to turn them back into
intricate neighborhoods. (He did this in South Beach where, among
other things, he bought the Tiffany Hotel, built in 1939, and
eventually hired Todd Oldham, the fashion designer, to turn it into
a chic boutique hotel.) That's one reason he rejects the term
developer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are knock 'em down, build 'em up guys,'' said
Goldman, the president of Goldman Properties, a company with 375
people in three cities: New York, Miami and Philadelphia. ``That's
not me.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that right now few Philadelphians want to take
leisurely strolls around their city. And the suburbanites who do
venture into the fancy restaurants downtown won't walk around;
instead, they pay $12 for curbside valet parking.
</P>
<P>
   So how do you remake the place?
</P>
<P>
   Goldman has acquired a motley zone of modest buildings in Center
City, an area with just enough grit _ porno movies, bars and vacant
buildings _ to deter most people from investing. Of the 30-some
properties Goldman has bought in Philadelphia, 13 are in the 13th
Street Passages neighborhood, as he calls the area around Walnut
and 13th Streets.
</P>
<P>
   His plan is to revamp the place over the next 18 months and
connect it to the nearby Avenue of the Arts section on Broad
Street, where the Regional Performing Arts Center, designed by
Rafael Vinoly, is rising among theaters and hotels. (The
Pennsylvania Convention Center, home to the Republican National
Convention this summer, is nearby.)
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Goldman has spent millions on
Philadelphia. To stretch his money, he convinced the city to make
the 13th Street Passages into a tax increment financing district,
which helps developers borrow money for blighted areas.
</P>
<P>
   His plan is to clean the area up by ending leases for, he said,
``a porno video store, check cashing place, gold chain store and
palm reader.'' He has turned an old office tower into his flagship
Philadelphia Building, on Walnut Street, and filled it with office
tenants. Now, he said, he has deals for three restaurants and three
shops on his desk. One is his own SoHo Kitchen and Bar, which is
being moved from Manhattan to Philadelphia. (He is redeveloping
part of Greene Street in Manhattan, where the restaurant used to
be.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be edgy,'' he said of his proposals. ``I want
impact.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldman's vision often involves relentless boosterism.
Philadelphia is ``the most undervalued, underappreciated and
overlooked city,'' he has told most publications in his newly
discovered town. Dressed like a carpetbagger _ in Armani,
black-on-black or white-on-white with an I-play-hard tan set off by
hipster shades and white hair _ he harangues Philadelphia residents
about their low civic self-esteem.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his more-talk-than-action approach to remaking
Philadelphia, he has fans throughout the city.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Kaplan, the executive director of the Philadelphia City
Planning Commission, believes his project is solid. ``We just wish
he would hurry up and do it,'' she said. Kaplan, an ex-New Yorker,
thinks that Philadelphia, her adopted city, is the ``undiscovered
gem of the East Coast.''
</P>
<P>
   But if the city is such a gem, why isn't the place full of
developers?
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of New York developers have come in and bought cheap _
then realized why it was cheap,'' Kaplan said. Philadelphia, a
smaller, slower city, has had an entrenched ability to withstand
gentrification.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to do the easy or obvious thing,'' she said.
``They're not willing to take a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Others also feel that it is time for Goldman's plans to be put
into action. Craig Berger, the director of projects at
Philadelphia's Foundation for Architecture, an organization that
promotes public dialogue in urban development, said, ``We're a
little tired of the hype.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he accepts that Goldman's talking about his
projects creates optimism, which fuels new deals.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman says that the infrastructure is already there. ``I love
the little streets,'' he said. ``Street beds 12 feet wide.
</P>
<P>
   What he is counting on is the same urge to live downtown that
has transformed other cities, from New York to Denver and beyond.
His tenants will be the entrepreneurs who buy living and work
spaces in old office buildings, and suburbanites who are ready to
abandon their big houses and cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just wait,'' he said. ``But don't believe what I say, believe
what I do.''

COMMENTARY: ALLY VS. CUSTOMER 
</HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM SAFIRE    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Israel is on the brink of endangering its strategic alliance
with the United States. Its leader seems to place higher priority
on a lucrative sale to China of Awacs spy planes equipped with the
most sophisticated Israeli-developed technology. Beijing could then
far better manage any battle with Taiwanese and American forces in
the Taiwan Strait.
</P>
<P>
   This week the U.S. defense secretary, William Cohen, went to
Jerusalem to plead with Prime Minister Ehud Barak to stop the Awacs
sale to China. Barak said he'd think about it.
</P>
<P>
   Next week President Jiang Zemin of China will arrive in Israel
to inspect the first Phalcon radar system mounted atop a Russian
Ilyushin transport. He is expected to offer to buy at least three
and perhaps seven more for a quarter of a billion dollars each.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Barak is faced with the stark choice between the interests
of an ally and the interests of a customer. But no major Israeli
leader, in government or opposition, has publicly raised an
objection or launched a debate. Few supporters of Israel in the
United States _ and certainly no candidate for president _ have
sounded an alarm.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis eager to consummate the deal say that the Clinton
administration failed to object when the sale was arranged four
years ago, when President Clinton was appeasing China as a
``strategic partner.'' They note that a business contract is a
solemn obligation, and that other arms customers might react badly
if the United States were seen to have a veto over Israeli weapons
sales.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, say the sellers of the newly equipped spy planes, this
deal will lead to greater penetration of the growing Chinese market
and to the strengthening of Israel's state-owned aircraft industry.
If the sale goes through, Beijing may permit diplomatic relations
with Israel to blossol; but if it does not, nobody can say what
missiles or nuclear technology an angry China may sell to enemies
of Israel like Iran or Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   But all these arguments pale in the face of today's overriding
danger: China is publicly menacing Taiwan with military action that
would cause the United States to help the 20 million free Chinese
on Taiwan defend themselves. Our policy is cloaked in calculated
ambiguity, but we are not ambivalent; in case of conflict, we would
not be conflicted.
</P>
<P>
   Strategic circumstances in Asia have changed, which means that
previous commercial considerations of the United States and its
allies must change with them. Israel cannot imperil a democratic
island of 20 million in Asia without imperiling its moral call on a
superpower to defend a democratic island of 6 million in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen, speaking in mushmouthed Pentagonese, told Barak the sale
would be ``counterproductive,'' and that ``the U.S. does not
support the sale of this type of technology to China because of the
potential of changing the strategic balance in that region.''
</P>
<P>
   Needed instead is a candid call from Clinton to say: Does Israel
seriously want to put at risk American sailors and airmen who may
have to intercede in the Taiwan Strait? Does Barak want to be the
prime minister who takes the special out of our special
relationship? If another war breaks out in the Middle East, from
which direction will Israel expect staunch moral and military
support _ east or west?
</P>
<P>
   I suspect that Barak will now try to split the difference. He is
likely to tell his next guest, Jiang, that Israel can deliver only
the one Phalcon-equipped aircraft already sold. As far as the other
seven China wants, it will have to build its own system or buy it
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   In that way, Barak would be able to say to Jiang, ``I delivered
on my contract despite awful arm-twisting from the Americans, and
now expect your support for a temporary seat when the U.N. Security
Council is expanded.'' He could then say to Clinton, ``I stopped
new Phalcon sales to China as you asked, at huge financial and
market-developing sacrifice, and how about reimbursement?''
</P>
<P>
   Some compromise. Chinese technicians, demonstrably better than
Americans at launching satellites, will begin to copy the advanced
Israeli battle-management technology as soon as the first Phalcon
Awacs is delivered. And they'll invite Israeli technicians to more
than Chinese dinners.
</P>
<P>
   Reconsider, Israel; let not your democratic hand lose its
cunning.
</P>

COMMENTARY: BUSH GOES GREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By BOB HERBERT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, boy.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes you'd like to say to the presidential candidates: Just
don't go there.
</P>
<P>
   That would have been the best advice for George W. Bush, who
decided this week that it might be fun to present himself as an
environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every environmental issue confronts us with a duty to be good
stewards,'' said Bush during an appearance in Pennsylvania on
Monday. ``As we use nature's gifts, we must do so wisely.
Prosperity will mean little if we leave future generations a world
of polluted air, toxic lakes and rivers, and vanished forests.''
</P>
<P>
   That odd noise you hear is coming from the governor's aides, who
have been trying desperately to stifle their laughter. This is
breathtaking, spectacular, Texas-sized chutzpah. Bush's
relationship to the environment is roughly that of a doctor to a
patient _ when the doctor's name is Kevorkian.
</P>
<P>
   Where to begin? OK, Let's start here. Bush's Texas is the most
polluted state in the union. It is an environmental disaster zone.
Last year Houston surpassed Los Angeles as the smoggiest city in
the United States. Texas as a whole had more smog alerts in 1999
than any other state. Texas ranked ahead of all states in the
discharge of recognized carcinogens into the air. It leads the
nation in the number of factories violating clean-water standards.
It leads the nation in the injection of toxic waste into
underground wells.
</P>
<P>
   And on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The Sierra Club, which knows a little something about the
environment, summed the matter up as follows: ``Texas ranks first
in toxic releases to the environment, first in total toxic air
emissions from industrial facilities, first in toxic chemical
accidents, and first in cancer-causing pollution.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October high school athletes in the Houston suburb of Deer
Park experienced coughing fits, difficulty breathing and other
forms of respiratory distress during one of the worst smog episodes
in the Houston area in years. Angry parents began demanding that
schools be notified when the air is particularly bad so strenuous
student activities can be curtailed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened during Bush's tenure is that by most measures
environmental quality in Texas has gotten worse,'' said Tom
(Smitty) Smith, director of the public interest group Texas Public
Citizen. ``Every chance that Bush has had, he's stood up for the
polluters.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's approach has not been subtle. His first appointment to
the state's environmental protection agency, the Texas Natural
Resources Conservation Commission, was Ralph Marquez, an executive
who had spent 30 years with the Monsanto Chemical Co. and had
served as the chairman of the environmental regulation committee of
the Texas Chemical Council, a trade association.
</P>
<P>
   Great idea! Let's put a top chemical company guy in charge of
regulating pollution from chemicals. Let's put the biggest,
hungriest fox we can find right at that gaping entrance to the
chicken coop.
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1995. Three weeks after Marquez's appointment, the
commission used its muscle to thwart a plan, already in the works,
to issue smog health advisories that would warn residents whenever
there were particularly high ozone levels in and around Houston.
</P>
<P>
   The business types in Houston hate health advisories and
anything else that calls attention to the city's dirty air. It's
bad for business. Just give the kids some cough drops.
</P>
<P>
   Marquez doesn't even think ozone is particularly bad for you.
Testifying before a congressional committee in November 1995, he
said: ``After all, ozone is not a poison or a carcinogen. It's a
relatively benign pollutant compared with other environmental
risks.''

   I've no doubt George W. is enjoying his spiffy new
environmentalist costume. The Bush men can always count on the
environment for a good laugh. Back in 1992, George H.W. Bush,
campaigning for re-election, gleefully derided Al Gore's interest
in the environment by dubbing the vice-presidential candidate ``the
Ozone Man.''
</P>
<P>
   The business types loved it.
</P>
<P>
   Bush the elder, smiling, said he was ``an environmental man''
too. He might as well have winked. He never expected anybody to
believe him. Costumes are about fun.

`SAVED' FROM BIG, BAD MICROSOFT?

<P>
   PHOENIX - In 1997, with its battle against the Justice
Department already 3 years old, Microsoft Corp. maintained a
Washington, D.C., government affairs office with all of four
employees. As columnist James Glassman noted at the time, AT&AMP;T
employed 45 lobbyists. IBM had 26.
</P>
<P>
   If there ever was a curious innocence to the unwillingness of
Bill Gates to play the Washington extortion game, it has
evaporated, along with tens of billions of dollars' worth of
investment in America's technology industry.
</P>
<P>
   Is Microsoft guilty, as federal District Court Judge Thomas
Penfield Jackson concluded Monday? It certainly is. Of criminal
naivete in the first degree. Microsoft, the greatest success story
of the New Economy, forgot Rule No. 1 of the Old Economy: Ignore
the regulatory power of the federal government at your peril.
</P>
<P>
   To the surprise of no one (except, it seems, the denizens of
Wall Street who utterly panicked at the news), Judge Jackson found
the Redmond, Wash., firm guilty of predatory anti-competitive
behavior. The world's largest software manufacturer, he said,
``placed an oppressive thumb on the scale of competitive fortune.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's bill of particulars is equally unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   He found that by means of restrictive contracts and bullying,
Microsoft monopolized the personal-computer operating system
business. Further, Jackson concluded that by tying its Internet
Explorer Web browser to its Windows operating system, Microsoft
unfairly blocked its competition in that incipient industry.
</P>
<P>
   But the judge fails to explain in any coherent way what damage
has been wrought upon consumers by Microsoft's manipulations _ a
point Attorney General Janet Reno has asserted on numerous
occasions rests at the core of the suit her prosecutors brought.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the ultradynamic computer industry has changed so
radically since the government leaped in to protect us that it is
utterly retro to even refer these days to the ``computer''
industry.
</P>
<P>
   To a great extent, technology has bypassed this fight. The
future of computerization today is not in the operating systems of
bulky, do-it-all desktops, but in Palm Pilots, wireless telephones
and a staggering variety of small appliances, all connected through
the Internet by systems that have nothing to do with Microsoft.
Does this suggest a latter-day version of a ubiquitous telephone
monopoly? Hardly.
</P>
<P>
   Well before the decision, Microsoft already had mitigated its
most egregious behaviors. It no longer writes into contracts
``bundling'' requirements for its various systems, for example. And
it will change still more. By the time this fight reaches a Supreme
Court resolution, as expected, technology and time may well have
rendered all points moot.
</P>
<P>
   There's another, not-insignificant point worth noting:
</P>
<P>
   When Judge Jackson's decision came down Monday, many among us
learned the details first by accessing a news Web site via
Microsoft's archcompetitor, Netscape Navigator.
</P>
<P>
   As the feds battled to save the world from Microsoft, some of us
already had saved ourselves.

EX-ENVOY HITS ADMINISTRATION CAVE-IN TO HELMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A career diplomat long affiliated with the Democratic
Party blasted the Clinton administration Wednesday for attempting
to appease Senator Jesse Helms and other congressional
conservatives, saying the executive branch has traded away its
leadership in foreign policy and gotten nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, who resigned as director of the US Agency for
International Development last year after it became clear Helms had
blocked his nomination to be ambassador to Brazil, said the
administration ``should have known better'' than to attempt to
appease the South Carolina archconservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Senator Helms a great deal,'' Atwood said in a
speech to the United Nations Association of Greater Boston and the
Boston Committee on Foreign Relations. ``He is a man of his word.
His position has been known for years and he has never changed that
position. He is opposed to the United Nations. He is opposed to
international engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood works on international development issues for Joseph P.
Kennedy 2d's Citizens Energy Corp. He declined to fault
administration officials by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're taking the Security Council down to
Washington to meet (Helms),'' Atwood said. ``All that's going to do
is empower him. It's going to encourage his colleagues to say `We
can't get into this, Jesse's handling it.' Baloney!''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said reducing US contributions to the United Nations may
be worth considering, but the way the United States is attempting
to do this is ill-advised and will harm the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is attemopting to accomplish this goal by
placing a legislatively imposed gun to the head of the General
Assembly,'' Atwood said. ``This is not a constructive way to
engage. This is not cooperation. This is an undisguised attempt to
blackmail. . . &UR;  &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we achieve in winning by blackmail?'' he asked. ``We
merely encourage others to use our methods. Do we want the
parliaments of Germany and Japan to hold back their UN payments
until those countries are made permanent members of the Security
Council?''

EUROPE SWINGS WITH WALL STREET; LONDON TAKES TIMEOUT DUE TO
TECHNICAL PROBLEMS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Stoxx in 11th graf is cq.) By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Unsettled by Wall Street's wild swings, European stocks
fell Wednesday, pulled down by some of the technology shares that
had been leading the market higher. But for British investors the
real news was that they could not trade for much of the day because
of an unexplained technical problem that crippled the London Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension of trading until late afternoon could hardly have
come at a worse time. Wednesday was the last day of the British
fiscal year for individuals, when investors usually scramble to
reduce tax exposure using a strategy known in the business as ``bed
and breakfast'' _ selling stocks today with an arrangement to buy
them back tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had all these private-client brokers coming in today to
arrange these deals, finding the stock exchange closed and going
ballistic,'' said one broker.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the breakdown coincided with reports that the London
exchange was in early merger talks with the Deutsche Boerse in
Frankfurt, and its negotiating position was clearly undermined by
such a technical debacle. Brokers showed no hesitation in venting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's diabolical,'' said David Donnelly, chief
investment officer at Gordon House Asset Management. ``If you think
that in today's technological world, the London Stock Exchange
can't open, it's incredible, farcical that there's no backup
facility to keep it running.''
</P>
<P>
   When trading did open at 3:45 p.m. _ the close was extended to 8
p.m. _ the London market followed the rest of Europe down.
</P>
<P>
   Europe's retreat affected just about every index, with new
economy stocks taking the brunt of the selling, which analysts
attributed to fears among investors that the risks of owning
technology and Internet stocks had risen because of the huge swings
on Tuesday on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trans-Atlantic correlation between the two markets is very
high,'' said Paul Horne, a European equity market economist with
Salomon Smith Barney in London. But, he said, the fall in European
technology stocks was part of a process that had been going on for
about a month, driven by expectations of higher interest rates in
the United States, Britain and the 11-nation euro-zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The markets are taking profits out of these overvalued and
under-earning shares,'' he said. ``There's a lot of hope, but not
much earning.''
</P>
<P>
   He forecast that volatility would continue on Thursday, as
investors bought their way back into old-sector stocks with the
potential to benefit from newer technologies.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones Stoxx 50 Price Index of European companies fell
2.8 percent, its sharpest drop since Jan. 4. But the Euro.NM index
of computer-related shares fell 4.7 percent, extending declines
that have stripped 35 percent of its value since its record high
set on March 10.
</P>
<P>
   In Helsinki, dominated by new economy stocks, the General Index
slumped 7.7 percent, dragged down by a sharp fall in Nokia, the
mobile phone company, which partly recovered before the close.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, the CAC-40 index closed off 3 percent, and Frankfurt's
Xetra DAX fell 2.6 percent. Among individual stocks, the sharpest
losses were among technology and computer-related companies with
high valuations based on assumptions a booming future profits.
</P>
<P>
   Sonera, Finland's biggest telephone company, fell 8.6 percent;
Canal Plus, the Continent's largest pay-TV company, fell 11.4
percent; and Cap Gemini, Europe's the biggest computer-services
group, fell 9.6 percent. The gloom disrupted plans by some
companies for initial share sales. Newconomy, for instance, which
aims to provide support for Internet-related businesses, postponed
plans for a $96 million flotation. Analysts forecast that the
number of such offerings would be sharply scaled back.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the misery elsewhere, there was one beneficiary of the
day's upheavals in London. Tradepoint Financial Networks, which
operates an electronic rival to the London exchange, recorded seven
times the trades as usual. ``This is a great day for us,'' a
spokesman said.

ARTHUR C. RUGE, 94; INVENTED GAUGE TO HELP MEASURE WEIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TOM LONG  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Arthur C. Ruge, the inventor of the ``strain gauge'' used in
many weight-measurement devices and to determine the stresses on
metals, died of heart failure Monday in his home in Lexington,
mass. He was 94.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Ruge was born in Tomah, Wis. He graduated from Carnegie
Institute of Technology in 1925. After working as a structural
steel engineer for several years he earned a master's degree in
civil engineering and a doctorate in engineering seismology at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined the faculty at MIT
in 1932.
</P>
<P>
   He invented the strain gauge in April 1938, while investigating
the effects of earthquakes on water towers.
</P>
<P>
   In a story published in the Boston Globe on March 3, 1986, when
he was named inventor of the year by Boston's Museum of Science,
Mr. Ruge said he remembered clearly the moment the idea came to
him. He was trying to develop a device to measure the stresses on
the bottoms of scale models of municipal water tanks. After months
of failure, he said, ``the invention just popped into my mind,
whole. I could see it clearly and knew that it would work.''
</P>
<P>
   Using glue and fine wire, he created an instrument the size of a
fingernail. By applying the wire in a rigid base (the glue) to the
surface of the tank, then measuring the change in resistance in the
wire as stress was applied, an accurate measurement of the stress
was acquired.
</P>
<P>
   Since its invention, the gauge has affected millions of people
around the world. Virtually all commercial scales employ the device
as the weight-sensing element. It has provided inexpensive,
accurate measurement of stresses on aircraft components and gun
barrels. It was a strain gauge that signaled Earth when the first
lunar lander touched the surface of the moon.
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, the MIT Patent Committee granted Mr. Ruge all rights to
the invention because while it was ``interesting,'' the committee
did not feel the commercial use would be of major importance.
</P>
<P>
   To market the device, which he called the SR-4 strain gauge, Mr.
Ruge and Alfred V. de Forest co-founded Ruge-de Forest Inc. in
1939. After selling the company in 1955, he founded Arthur C. Ruge
Associates, a consulting firm that he owned and operated until his
retirement in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves a daughter, Claire Bertucci; and two grandchildren.

HOUSE VOTES TO BAN `PARTIAL-BIRTH' ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Facing a certain presidential veto and an uncertain
hearing by the Supreme Court, the House Wednesday overwhelmingly
passed a ban on ``partial-birth abortions,'' holding doctors
criminally liable for performing the late-term procedure.
</P>
<P>
   The 287-141 vote is large enough for the House to overturn a
threatened third veto by President Clinton, though the Senate fell
short of a veto-proof majority when it passed its version of the
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the impassioned debate in Congress provides a glimpse of
the arguments that will echo in the courts and the congressional
and presidential campaigns in the coming months.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court is to consider a Nebraska ban on the abortion
procedure April 25, and a decision is expected before the high
court adjourns in late June. With the high court narrowly divided
on abortion, the matter is also expected to enter the presidential
campaign, since the next president may appoint as many as three new
justices to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   In the House Wednesday, Democrats who favor abortion rights
railed against their Republican colleagues, charging that they were
trying to eradicate the landmark Roe v. Wade decision legalizing
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans repeated gruesome, graphic descriptions of the
procedure, challenging Democrats to explain to voters this fall how
they could support what critics called ``infanticide.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you cannot see the abject, inhuman cruelty'' of the
procedure, ``then I fear for you,'' said a somber-sounding House
Majority Leader Richard Armey, Republican of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats said the Republicans were using the distasteful
description of one abortion method to take the right away from all
women.
</P>
<P>
   ``Proponents of this bill are not just chipping away at the
right to choose. They are taking a jackhammer to it,'' said
Representative Louise Slaughter, Democrat of New York.
</P>
<P>
   The all-Democrat Massachusetts congressional delegation voted
against the bill, except for Representatives J. Joseph Moakley and
Richard Neal, both of Massachusetts. Both men are antiabortion.
</P>
<P>
   The legislation seeks to prohibit what opponents call
``partial-birth abortion,'' a politically loaded term for a medical
procedure known as ``intact dilation and extraction.''
</P>
<P>
   The process involves dilating the cervix and manipulating the
fetus into a breech position, according to the American College of
Obstetricians and Gynecologists. The fetus is pulled through the
vagina, and the head is partially evacuated while still inside the
pregnant woman. The dead fetus is then extracted vaginally,
according to the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Since no one keeps figures on methods of abortion, it is not
possible to determine how many such procedures are done yearly, the
ACOG said. But since fewer than 6 percent of abortions are
performed after the 16th week of pregnancy, ``it's not very
common,'' said ACOG spokeswoman Ann Allen.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're really done for tragic circumstances,'' such as when
the pregnant female's life or health is at stake, or when the fetus
has a ``fatal anomoly,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Abortion foes described the procedure Wednesday in far more
graphic terms, using photographs to attempt to sway their
colleagues to vote for the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partial-birth abortion isn't being done for the health of the
woman. It's being done for the convenience of the abortionist,''
said Representative Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure said the bill went much further than
banning the procedure and could theoretically be used to ban nearly
all abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partial-birth abortion is a political term, not a medical
term,'' said Pam Nourse, spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood
League of Massachusetts, which is fighting a similar bill in the
Massachusetts Legislature. ``We asking people to look beyond the
rhetoric to what the bill really does,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Barney Frank, Democrat of Massachusetts, also
tried to insert language that would make an exception if the health
of the pregnant female was at stake, but that, too, was defeated.
</P>
<P>
   Frank accused the Republicans of cynically passing legislation
they knew would never become law so they could schedule a veto
override vote right before the November elections.

<P>
   BEREZNIKI, Russia _ When the Russian military roared into
Chechnya in late September, most people in this factory town in the
Urals were convinced that the Kremlin had begun a just and
triumphant war.
</P>
<P>
   But that was before the bodies arrived, the flags were draped
with black ribbons and a local sports complex was turned into a
hall of remembrance for 16 policemen who were killed in an ambush
in Chechnya last week.
</P>
<P>
   Now lust for revenge, irritation with Russia's bumbling generals
and anxiety that the nation is enmeshed in an open-ended guerrilla
war dominate the talk here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until recently I thought we should fight until we win,'' said
a 56-year-old pensioner named Yuliya, 56. ``But the way the
military is running things today, I don't think victory can be
achieved. There is no sense sending our boys there.''
</P>
<P>
   As the war against Chechnya, the breakaway region in the
Caucasus, enters its seventh month, there has been a subtle but
unmistakable shift in the public mood in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians still seem to think that the nation has every
right to re-establish its control over Chechnya, and Russian enmity
toward the rebels there seems greater than ever. But an increasing
number of Russians worry that their nation has plunged into a
military quagmire.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls show that a majority of Russians no longer
believe their generals' assurance that the militants are on the
verge of defeat. And there are growing fears that the military's
approach is costing too many Russian lives.
</P>
<P>
   The swing of mood is certainly evident in Berezniki, an
industrial town of 180,000 that is a three-hour drive from Perm,
the regional capital. Surrounded by forests of fir trees, frozen
lakes and fields of snow, Berezniki seems as far from Chechnya as
one can imagine. It is a town with a history of quiet fealty to the
state.
</P>
<P>
   Berezniki may be the one place in Russia that is proud of its
connection to former President Boris Yeltsin, who graduated from
the local secondary school. Yeltsin's hand-picked successor,
Vladimir Putin, received 63 percent of the vote here in last
month's presidential election, well above his national average of
52.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
   As Chechnya dissolved into chaos after the first war there in
1994-96, there was a lot of discussion here about whether Russian
troops should again get involved. But after Putin decided to take
the fight to the rebels, Berezniki did its part.
</P>
<P>
   Along with other specially trained riot police _ a SWAT-like
Interior Ministry force known as OMON _ from the Perm region,
Berezniki's militia was dispatched to Chechnya to take charge of
areas that the regular army troops were supposed to have secured.
The policemen were local heroes.
</P>
<P>
   By March the militia was in Vedeno, the hometown of Shamil
Basayev, one of the most notorious Chechen warlords.
</P>
<P>
   Then the news broke last week that a convoy of militia from the
Perm region had been ambushed on a road outside Vedeno and that 25
Russian dead had been recovered.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush was a terrible blow for the Perm district, which has
lost 181 men in the two conflicts in Chechnya, compared with 142
who perished in the 10-year Soviet war in Afghanistan. The toll in
Chechnya is certain to rise, since 11 members of the Perm militia
are still missing and Basayev asserted Wednesday that his fighters
had captured and executed nine of them.
</P>
<P>
   It was a catastrophe in Berezniki. Its small militia accounted
for 16 of the dead in the ambush.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding the grief were accusations that senior Russian
commanders had dispatched the lightly armed police convoy on a road
that was not under Russian control and then failed to provide a
proper military escort.
</P>
<P>
   The ambush was a virtual repetition of a rebel attack near
Grozny just a month ago against a militia unit from the Russian
town of Sergiyev Posad. It, too, did not have a military escort,
and many people here cannot understand how top Russian commanders
managed to step on the same rake twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``The city is in shock, and there is a lot of talk that the war
needs to be brought to an end,'' said Aleksandr Moshkin,
Berezniki's mayor. ``When corpses arrive it always sparks debate
about what has to be done and why our guys died there. But at the
same time, Russia's territorial integrity should be preserved.''
</P>
<P>
   Moshkin said the town was so distrustful of Russia's military
leadership that it would not believe the military's investigation
of the incident unless representatives from the Perm region took
part.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday a violinist played a funeral dirge as thousands of
the town's residents filed past the row of bodies, which were laid
out in an indoor track-and-field complex here. The families of the
dead policemen sat on small wooden chairs grouped around the open
plywood coffins, which were wrapped in red fabric.
</P>
<P>
   Some wives stroked the heads of their slain husbands, whose
foreheads were covered by paper bands bearing a Russian Orthodox
prayer. A gun-toting sentry stood at attention at the head of each
coffin.
</P>
<P>
   A senior Interior Ministry official gave a speech, proclaiming
the men martyrs in the battle against terrorism. But the governor
of the Perm region, Gennadi Igumnov, was closer to the public mood
when he described the deaths as the result of incompetence by
Russia's military officers, who had failed to protect the convoy.
It was the first time that a governor has been so critical of the
military's conduct in the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the guilt for the death of our magnificent guys is the
result of our commanders' negligence,'' he said. ``The names of
these people will be made public, and they will get the punishment
they deserve.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; (MORE)
</P>
<P>
   Then, after prayers by several priests, the hall reverberated
with the clatter of hammers as the coffins were nailed shut.
</P>
<P>
   Each was loaded onto the back of a light truck, which carried a
tombstone bearing the likenesses of the slain policemen and a red
five-pointed star. A long procession of shiny government Volga
sedans and humble Lada compacts then snaked its way to the
cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   Although such setbacks have not led to a substantial drop in
popular support for continuing to fight the Chechen rebels, polls
show a growing skepticism about the claims of Russia's generals
that victory is imminent.
</P>
<P>
   A nationwide survey of 1,500 adults by Romir, a Russian polling
organization, carried out before the ambush of the Perm militia,
found that about 60 percent of the Russian public thought the war
would go on for a long time, if not forever.
</P>
<P>
   In Berezniki the percentage is probably far higher. Many people
here appear to have conflicting thoughts. They want the war to be
finished as soon as possible. They do not want to make concessions
to the rebels. And they do not want any more Russian casualties,
especially among their own friends and relatives.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Seryodkin, 50, a chemical equipment operator, represented
one pole in the debate. He said the only hope was to gather the
Chechen population and deport it, much as Stalin did in 1944.
</P>
<P>
   ``They should be divided up in groups and gradually sent to
different parts of Russia,'' he said. ``We have so much land in
Siberia and in the north.''
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Malyavkin, 44, has been in a wheelchair since he was
wounded when he served in the Soviet Army during the invasion of
Czechoslovakia in 1968. He said too many Russians had died in
Chechnya to pull out now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Revenge is not the solution to the problem,'' he said. ``But
this has to be completed.''
</P>
<P>
   Oleg Ryashev, the deputy commander of the Berezniki militia, has
a different view, perhaps because he has been chastened by
experience. He has served in Chechnya, though he was not there at
the time of the latest attack.
</P>
<P>
   He cautioned that the Russian authorities would not succeed if
they depended entirely on military force. Moscow, he argued, needs
a political strategy. And he said it would have a better chance of
success if it managed somehow to forge an alliance with one of the
Chechen clans. Even so, he doubted that doing do would stop all the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are just too many weapons there,'' he said, ``and all
the kids have been taught to hate Russia since childhood.''
</P>
<P>
   But what everybody seemed to agree about was that the war was
not going according to plan and that Russia's strategy needed to be
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something is wrong in Chechnya,'' said Mestnoye Vremya, a
weekly newspaper in the region whose name means ``Local Time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody feels it,'' the paper said. ``And the death of our
guys, or to be more correct, the way they died, makes this feeling
stronger.''

MAGELLAN FUND NO LONGER NO. 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Fidelity's Magellan fund was edged off its pedestal as
the world's biggest mutual fund during Tuesday's stock shock,
according to a firm that closely tracks the Boston fund group.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard Group's Index 500 fund grabbed the No. 1 spot by a
hair, according to calculations by Jim Lowell, editor of the
Fidelity Investor, an independent newsletter, and Daniel Wiener,
who follows Vanguard.
</P>
<P>
   At the close of trading Tuesday, Lowell said, Magellan had
$106.9 billion of assets, while Vanguard's Index 500 fund had
$107.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first day in its history that Magellan woke up
without the crown on its head,'' Lowell said.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan is the fund that made Peter Lynch famous in the 1980s.
The portfolio exploded under his watch, and his prowess at stock
picking became the standard for investing in growth companies.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan's vast girth came under attack when Jeff Vinik ran the
fund and underperformed the benchmark Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index.
Critics argued that investors were better off in Vanguard's index
fund, which mirrors the S&AMP;P 500, saying Magellan could no longer
beat the index.
</P>
<P>
   But Bob Stansky has silenced the critics during his tenure
running Magellan, beating the S&AMP;P 500 in 1998 and 1999. Even in the
recent battering of technology stocks, Magellan maintained a 2.9
percent gain since Jan. 1. Its top holdings include stocks that
have tumbled lately, such as Microsoft Corp. and Texas Instruments
Inc. Vanguard's index fund is up 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Neither fund company would confirm the latest asset numbers, but
both said the figures were slightly low.
</P>
<P>
   Lowell and Weiner said their estimates were based on careful
calculations. They used the funds' reported assets from March 31,
then accounted for investment performance in the first four days of
April, plus estimates of the average daily sums investors put into
the funds and remove from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tug of war,'' said Lowell, who's been watching the
horse race between Magellan and Vanguard's index fund for three
months. Wiener predicted Vanguard would overtake Fidelity's
flagship fund as early as January, but the lead is hardly a
commanding one _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   Said Lowell, ``Magellan will probably take it back _ maybe
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard nonetheless put out a quietly celebratory statement:
``The asset growth of the Vanguard 500 Index Fund is a clear
indication that investors have come to realize the fundamentally
compelling benefits of indexing,'' said John Brennan, the Valley
Forge, Pa.-based firm's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Index fans say returns in passive funds are better than in
active funds over time. Expenses are generally lower in index
funds, and capital gains taxes are smaller because the funds buy
and sell stocks less frequently than actively managed funds.
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard funds mushroomed in size with the rise in popularity of
index funds in the second half of the 1990s. The S&AMP;P 500 beat most
active funds in those years, until last year. Magellan closed to
new investors in September 1997 but remains Fidelity's most popular
fund among retirement-account customers.
</P>
<P>
   Magellan's assets appear to have fallen more sharply than
Vanguard's in the first week of April, with the market's gyrations.
Fidelity said Magellan's assets totaled $109.1 billion on March 31.
Vanguard Index 500's were at $107.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Fidelity spokeswoman Ann Crowley said, ``We're not concerned
with having the largest fund. We're concerned about good
performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Vanguard's Brennan, too, noted that investment performance
matters more than size.
</P>
<P>
   ``We also believe that it is irrelevant for investors to focus
on a single fund's assets,'' he said in his statement. ``We measure
our success by how well we are serving our shareholders _ both
individual and institutional.''

<P>
   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia _ This is the way Doc Phum got his land: by
crawling on his belly through a minefield, poking at the ground
with a knife until he hit something hard, then throwing rocks at it
until it exploded.
</P>
<P>
   ```I know it wasn't my land,'' he said. ``It didn't belong to
anybody. But I demined it, and it was good farmland.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the way he lost it three years later: 200 armed men
arrived with bulldozers just before harvest time last year and tore
up the fields and thatched huts of Doc Phum and 100 other
subsistence farmers. A local general had decided to build a casino.
</P>
<P>
   ``Go ahead and file your complaints,'' said the general,
according to another villager, Reach Somaly. ``I don't care. The
guys at the top are my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   As Cambodia emerges fitfully from three decades of mass killings
and civil war, land disputes and land grabbing have spread across
the country. And a basic truth about Cambodian society is being
reaffirmed: Cambodia belongs to the powerful.
</P>
<P>
   With the collapse of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla insurgency and an
end to factional fighting within the government, tens of thousands
of landless farmers now find themselves in competition with
business interests and military officers for former battlegrounds
and minefields.
</P>
<P>
   A result is a new generation of dispossessed people in a country
where land ownership has been in dispute since the overthrow in
1979 of the brutal Khmer Rouge government, which had taken all the
land for itself.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, mass killings and warfare have created huge waves of
refugees, and many of Cambodia's people _ more than 80 percent of
whom are farmers _ remain wanderers.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, only 14 percent of land is properly registered, and
many of those registrations are fraudulent. Even in the capital,
Phnom Penh, three-fourths of the land is not secured by a legal
title, according to the ministry of land management.
</P>
<P>
   The battles over land are being fought by people who have been
toughened by generations of brutality in Cambodia. So the methods
of eviction sometimes involve throwing a hand grenade into a crowd
or firing B-40 rockets at buildings or cutting off the heads of
stubborn villagers or, as in a case in March, burning down 60 homes
that had been built for widows, orphans and disabled veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Desperation and a dawning sense among some poor people that they
do have rights have led to a new phenomenon _ a changing but nearly
permanent colony of squatters in a park outside the Parliament
building here. They are evicted villagers who have come from
various provinces to petition for redress, spending their days with
paid scribes to send letters to every official and ministry they
can think of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their lack of sophistication, people when they are
angry go everywhere and send letters everywhere to every kind of
official,'' said George Cooper, a lawyer with a private group
called Legal Aid of Cambodia. ``It's sort of, in one way,
inefficient because they are firing shots all over the place. On
the other hand, it means officials of all kinds have been bombarded
_ really bombarded _ by complaints. Because these people are really
up against it; they don't have any land, and they don't have any
food.''
</P>
<P>
   Doc Phum and Reach Somaly are among more than 200 landless
people from four provinces who now live under the tamarind trees
outside the Parliament building, not far from a hospital where most
of the children they have brought with them are being treated for
chicken pox, which is epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Among the people here are Meas Sophan, 45, and her three hungry
children, who pull off and chew the tender, sour leaves of the
tamarind trees that shelter them. They are part of a group of
villagers from the province of Kompong Thom who are protesting not
the loss of their land but the loss of the trees in which they
lived.
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Meas Sophan said, they were forced by flooding to
leave their rice fields. When they tried to return, the fields had
been occupied by other, more powerful people.
</P>
<P>
   So the villagers climbed big trees along a river, and had lived
there ever since _ cooking, sleeping and fishing in the branches
above the water. When the river rose, they climbed higher, she
said. When it receded, they descended.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not an easy way to live,'' she said, ``especially when
you drop a pot or a glass or a knife into the water. There's
nothing you can do until the dry season, when you can go down and
look for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the government granted a fishing concession
to a private company, and the villagers were evicted from their
trees.
</P>
<P>
   Now all they have is this sidewalk in Phnom Penh, where they
subsist for the moment on donations from aid groups and sacks of
rice from King Norodom Sihanouk, the nearly powerless monarch, who
lives next door in his palace.
</P>

<P>
   Va Sophal, 40, is a former Khmer Rouge foot soldier and a former
refugee who describes himself, with a surprisingly bold grin, as
``a powerless person, the poorest farmer you can find.''
</P>
<P>
   Since he fled the Khmer Rouge ranks in 1979, he said, he has
spent his years shifting from one refugee camp to another and from
one plot of farmland to another, barely managing to feed himself
from day to day.
</P>
<P>
   He came here with a group of evicted farmers from O'Smach, in
northwestern Cambodia, an area filled with land mines and malaria.
It had been a battleground for most of his life.
</P>
<P>
   Now for the first time, he said, he is doing battle for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my own feelings, I believe I have as many rights as
anybody,'' he said. ``But when they use their power against me and
take my land away, I'm not so sure anymore. The only thing for us
is to unite and come here and sleep under the tamarind trees and
see whether anyone will do anything to help us.''  &QL;

   ATLANTA _ Tennessee authorities won't determine until at least
next week whether they will file criminal charges against a school
bus driver who rolled into the path of a freight train, causing a
collision that killed three children, according to the Tennessee
State Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are still attempting to gather evidence and talk to
witnesses,'' said Dana Keeton, spokeswoman for the agency, which is
investigating the March 28 crash in which the bus driver's daughter
was among those critically injured. ``We want to make sure we do
everything right.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency has given National Transportation Safety Board
investigators the videotape from the camera inside the school bus.
Technicians at the NTSB, which investigates all major crashes, will
enhance the audio and video, Keeton said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators have said the tape, witnesses and physical
evidence show bus driver Rhonda Cloer, 34, failed to stop before
entering the crossing, which is near the Tennessee-Georgia line.
Tennessee law requires school bus drivers to stop 15 to 50 feet
from a crossing. Violation of the law is a misdemeanor punishable
by up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $500.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer, of Chatsworth, Ga., has not talked to investigators. Her
lawyer, Greg Melton of Dalton, Ga., said he has advised Cloer not
to talk until he reviews the bus' videotape.
</P>
<P>
   ``She very badly wants to talk about this,'' Melton said. ``I
hope that will be sooner rather than later. It is her absolute
right to remain silent. At a minimum, we've been asking for a piece
of evidence we have every right to see.''
</P>
<P>
   Kayli Cloer, 5, and Kevin Sherrill, 8, are in critical condition
at T.C. Thompson Children's Hospital in Chattanooga, Tenn. Rhonda
Cloer and two students were hospitalized briefly.
</P>
<P>
   Cloer has remained with her daughter at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see how she's held up as well has she has,'' said
Melton.

DOUBTS ABOUT LEWIS DIAGNOSIS VOICED AT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ During tense, combative testimony, the former
supervisor of Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., the doctor who announced
publicly that Reggie Lewis had a benign fainting condition that
would not end his basketball career, said Wednesday that he had
doubts about Mudge's diagnosis and worried that, if Mudge were
wrong, Lewis could die.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the first time in the case, which ended in a hung
jury last year, Dr. Eugene Braunwald said he questioned Mudge's
diagnosis, which was at odds with the conclusion reached by a team
of preeminent cardiologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I questioned his degree of certainty,'' said Braunwald, a
cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who chaired the
hospital's medical department when Lewis was under Mudge's care in
1993. ``I thought he might be right, but I wasn't as confident and
sure as he seemed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge ``seemed to think this was open and shut. . . but I wasn't
all that certain,'' added Braunwald, testifying on the third day of
the retrial in the medical malpractice lawsuit stemming from the
Celtics star's July 1993 death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew that if he was wrong, Mr. Lewis's life was in
jeopardy, didn't you?'' asked Neil Rossman, the lawyer representing
Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, who sued Mudge for wrongful
death after her 27-year-old husband died of heart failure three
months after he came under Mudge's care.
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald paused for several seconds, then replied, ``That's
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald, who was not called to the stand during the first
trial, was clearly a reluctant witness. Called as a plaintiff's
witness by Rossman, Braunwald acknowledged that he had refused to
meet with Rossman or take his phone calls prior to his courtroom
appearance. And throughout Rossman's questioning, Braunwald was
frequently argumentative and uncooperative, prompting the judge to
intercede several times and ask him to answer the questions posed
to him.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange that lasted at least 10 minutes and prompted
laughs from the jury, Rossman tried to get Braunwald to concede
that neurocardiogenic syncope _ the fainting condition Mudge said
Lewis had _ is not a medical condition that can cause death.
Braunwald insisted that if a person experienced neurocardiogenic
syncope while crossing a street and fainted in front of a truck, he
could indeed die.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doctor,'' Rossman finally asked, ``neurocardiogenic
syncope alone won't kill you, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Braunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   But Braunwald also testified that while he asked Mudge if he
felt ``all that certain'' about his fainting diagnosis, which Mudge
announced at a May 1993 press conference, Mudge told him privately
that he was also considering a second diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   A central component of Mudge's defense is that despite his claim
at the press conference that Lewis suffered only from a fainting
disorder, he also believed Lewis might have a cardiac arrhythmia, a
potentially lethal heart condition. Indeed, at the first trial,
Mudge testified that he, the Lewises, hospital officials, and
Celtics representatives had a ``calculated plan'' to conceal the
second, more worrisome diagnosis from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has testified that Mudge never told her or her
husband that he could have a life-threatening disorder.
</P>
<P>
   During his questioning of Braunwald, Rossman established that
nowhere in Lewis's Brigham medical records was there any indication
that Mudge believed he suffered from an arrhythmia.
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald appeared more composed under questioning by Mudge's
attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., who asked him to elaborate on why
he had called Lewis's medical case ``challenging'' and
``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald noted that multiple tests run on Lewis had yielded
conflicting data, forcing doctors to ``try to sort out a lot of
evidence, some of which was contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a clear set of signals that we received from the
patient,'' he added. ``That's what made the case very, very
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald also noted that a person can suffer from
neurocardiogenic syncope and arrhythmia simultaneously, further
complicating efforts to diagnose Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Mudge had said during the press conference that
``medicine is an art, not a science,'' Dailey asked Braunwald if it
is ``true that medicine is not a precise science?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet,'' Braunwald replied.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey's questioning went to the core of a key issue the jury
will have to consider: in medical malpractice cases, juries are
told it is not enough to find that a doctor made a mistake. They
must find that the care deviated from ``acceptable standards of
practice.''

&HT;     LAZIO, CRITICAL OF GIULIANI, RECONSIDERS SENATE RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAN FREEDMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., said Wednesday a thumbs
down from New York Gov. George Pataki would make it virtually
impossible for him to challenge New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani for
the Republican senatorial nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki appeared to oblige him, telling reporters in Albany that
``it's not particularly helpful'' for Republicans like Lazio to do
anything other than support Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, 42, a fourth-term House member who last year bowed to
Pataki's entreaties to make way for Giuliani, said in an interview
Wednesday that the governor's disapproval would ``disincline me''
from challenging Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   But he continued to insist that the controversial mayor was
dragging the GOP down with him in an increasingly bitter contest
against the Democratic candidate, First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton. The winner in November will replace Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, a Democrat who is retiring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not trying to be difficult or defiant or create heartburn
for the Republican leadership in New York,'' Lazio said. ``What I'm
trying to do is encourage the Republican leadership to make a sober
assessment as to where they are with the Senate race, and to think
of the world not in terms of the way they'd like it to be, but the
world the way it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio said he wanted to discuss with the Republican governor
about getting into the race, but that Pataki had not returned a
phone call. Pataki's spokeswoman, Zenia Mucha, said late Wednesday
that Pataki had placed a call to Lazio, but she was unsure if they
had connected.
</P>
<P>
   Still, whether on the phone or to reporters, Pataki's message to
Lazio was loud and clear: Stay out. ``I don't think it's
particularly helpful for other Republicans to do anything other
than get behind the candidacy of Mayor Giuliani,'' Pataki said. ``I
urge (Lazio) and all others to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Byzantine political drama arose in the wake of Giuliani's
strident defense of the New York police in shootings of unarmed
minorities. Last month, after one such shooting death, Giuliani
released the sealed juvenile arrest record of the victim, Patrick
Dorismond, and insisted that he was not ``an altar boy.''
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Giuliani's poll numbers have plummeted. A Quinnipiac
College Polling Institute survey released Wednesday showed Giuliani
with 43 percent to Clinton's 46 percent. Early last month in the
same poll, Giuliani led Clinton 48 percent to 41 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a real problem,'' Lazio said. ``If you don't
acknowledge it's a problem, you're not dealing in reality. Some of
that (support) may well come back. But some of it might not.''
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani could have defended the police and shown sympathy for
concerns of the minority community as well as the victim's family,
he said. ``There is racial tension in New York, and if you want to
alleviate that, you've got to show some sensitivity to the way
people think.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio has won an implicit nod from New York's Conservative
Party, whose candidates poll anywhere between 300,000 and 2 million
votes, and often make the difference between Republican electoral
success and failure.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, by contrast, has drawn the Conservatives' ire for not
backing efforts to outlaw late-term abortions and accepting the
endorsement of the state's Liberal Party.
</P>
<P>
   Although Lazio favors keeping abortion legal, he has voted in
the House to ban late-term abortions _ a measure ultimately vetoed
by President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lazio could be the right person,'' said Michael Long,
Conservative Party chairman. ``The ballgame is a wide-open
ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio insisted that although Election Day is seven months away
and he is way behind Giuliani in raising money, he stands the best
chance of beating Hillary Clinton. Republicans ``can either have
someone who can unify the party, who can draw soft Democrats and
independents, (and) who can bring the Conservative Party on board,
or they can go in another direction,'' he said. ``Before they go
down another path, I just would like them to think about what
they're buying into.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, for his part appeared unimpressed by Lazio's argument.
``I think he's just wrong,'' Pataki said.

MOSCOW OPENS CHEMICAL WEAPONS DESTRUCTION CENTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID FILIPOV  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the high-security research institute that once
developed much of the Kremlin's 44,000 tons of chemical weapons,
smiling US and Russian officials Wednesday unveiled a
state-of-the-art control center to oversee the destruction of an
arsenal capable of wiping out all life on Earth hundreds of times
over.
</P>
<P>
   The opening of the spiffy, $18.5 million facility _ funded and
built by Americans in a compound where 10 years ago no Westerner
could get past the heavily armed guards _ provided a rare, upbeat
moment for what has become a very shaky Russian-American
relationship. But the moment was very short-lived.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after US Ambassador James Collins hailed the new center
as a sign of post-Cold War cooperation, Russia's domestic security
service announced that it had detained an American citizen and a
Russian associate on suspicion of spying.
</P>
<P>
   Collins refused to comment, but the Russian security service,
known here as the FSB, alleged the American had tried to purchase
Russian defense industry secrets. Without revealing the suspects'
identities, the FSB said the American was a manager of a private
company in Moscow and a former career intelligence officer, while
the Russian was described as ``an expert in defense technologies
employed by a Moscow organization.''
</P>
<P>
   The arrests, part of an escalating espionage conflict between
Russia and the West in which dozens of foreigners and Russians have
been detained here, quickly dampened the spirit of partnership at
Wednesday's arms-control ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   The new spy scandal also epitomized how renewed tensions between
Russia and the US keep getting in the way of one of the few joint
projects both sides qualify as a success: the US-funded disarmament
projects collectively known as Cooperative Threat Reduction,
commonly referred to as the ``Nunn-Lugar'' program, after its
sponsors, former Senator Sam Nunn and Senator Richard Lugar.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1991 Nunn-Lugar money has helped Russia safely destroy
thousands of nuclear weapons, and eliminate potentially hazardous
fuel and missile components. The idea behind the program is simple
_ by helping Russia comply with disarmament treaties, the United
States helps itself by keeping weapons from falling into the hands
of rogue states. But the dismantling of Russia's deadly chemical
arsenal, sometimes referred to as ``poor man's nuclear weapons''
for their relative technological simplicity, has only just begun.
</P>
<P>
   When Moscow ratified an international ban on chemical weapons in
1997, officials estimated that destroying its stockpiles, which
dwarf even the US arsenal of 32,000 tons, would cost $5 billion
over 10 years, a price Russia says it cannot afford.
</P>
<P>
   The facility opened Wednesday, located at Moscow's State
Scientific Research Institute of Organic Chemistry and Technology,
is part of an $888 million Nunn-Lugar project that includes the
construction of a site to destroy more than 6,000 tons of chemical
weapons stockpiled in Schuchye, 960 miles east of Moscow. US
officials say the Schuchye site, when completed, would provide a
model for similar facilities at Russia's six other major stockpiles
of nerve, blister and choking agents.
</P>
<P>
   The development of these plants will start in the new center, a
spotless facility that looked out of place among the decrepit
buildings, leaky pipes and barbed wire of the rest of the
institute. Scientists at the center will help evaluate technologies
for destroying chemical weapons, assess their impact on the
environment and train personnel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerve agents are very lethal _ one drop can kill,'' said
Miguel Morales, a spokesman for the Cooperative Threat Reduction
Program. ``When you're destroying chemical weapons, you want to
make sure they're completely destroyed.''
</P>
<P>
   Zinovy Pak, the head of Russia's Munition Agency, which is in
charge of dismantling chemical weapons, voiced hope that the US
assistance would help Russia catch up to its timetable for
fulfilling its international obligations.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the global ban, Russia was supposed to
destroy 440 tons of chemical weapons by April 29, but had to
request an extention because of chronic budget woes. Pak promised
to ``do all we can'' to meet the April 2002 deadline of the second
stage, which calls for the destruction of 8,800 tons of chemical
weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we must say,'' Pak added, ``that this task is incredibly
hard to accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Adding to the difficulty was a decision by the US Congress to
halt funding for the Schuchye complex for 2000. General Thomas E.
Kuenning, director of the Cooperative Threat Reduction program,
said Congress had been discouraged by the slow progress of the
site, as well as Russian requests that part of the US funding go to
social programs and local infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
   Kuenning said President Clinton had decided to press ahead with
the project in the hope that Congress changes its mind by next
year.
</P>
<P>
   The worsening climate of US-Russia relations might affect this
choice. The West's relations with Russia have been strained by
Moscow's protest of NATO's air-assault last year on Yugoslavia and
Western criticism of Moscow's military offensive in Chechnya.
Disagreements over nuclear arms treaties and the increase in
espionage cases have not helped the atmosphere, either.
</P>
<P>
   But the US officials in Moscow Wednesday were hopeful that they
could finish their project no matter what the climate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regardless of what's going on, we try to stay above the
political issues,'' Morales said.

TRIBUNAL HEARS VIVID TESTIMONY OF RAPES BY SERB SOLDIERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds.: Note strong content thruout.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KEVIN CULLEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   THE HAGUE _ She was a virtual slave, forced to do the housework
when she wasn't being raped, and so when she saw her captor, a Serb
soldier, come through the door wounded, his arm heavily bandaged,
for once she was thankful for the war and thought she would be left
alone for one, just one, night.
</P>
<P>
   But he raped her anyway.
</P>
<P>
   It was 1992. She was 15.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about how an individual who had been wounded or
injured could do something like that,'' the woman, a Bosnian Muslim
and now 23, said Tuesday as she sat in the witness stand.
</P>
<P>
   How anyone could do what is being alleged in Courtroom One at
the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia is
almost beyond comprehension.
</P>
<P>
   But the charges, besides being sickening, stake out new ground
in international law. This is the first case in which rape and
sexual assault are the sole basis of a war crimes prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making history here, and it's about time,'' said
Patricia Sellers, the tribunal's legal adviser for sexual crimes.
``It's too late for all the women who were raped in war time. But
we are drawing a line here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sellers, 45, is a lawyer with a remarkably varied career that
has seen her work as a public defender in Philadelphia and a tax
attorney for the Price Waterhouse accounting firm. Now she has
orchestrated a precedent-setting case that aims to change the way
the civilized world regards rape in wartime.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first case in which prosecutors are arguing that
rape can be genocidal,'' said Sellers. ``We're trying to show the
war as sexual violence, that part of the attack on the civilian
population was sexual violence.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, 1992, the town of Foca, southeast of Sarajevo, was
overrun by Serb forces bent on ridding Bosnia of Muslims and
Croats. About half of its 40,000 residents were Muslim, the rest
Serb.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens, if not hundreds, of Muslim women were made sex slaves,
held in homes, apartments, hotels, and the local sports auditorium
and high school, to serve Serb soldiers, who returned from a day of
fighting to rape them. The men would line the women up and pick
them, as if for a pickup basketball game.
</P>
<P>
   A 12-year-old girl told investigators she was raped daily by
soldiers for months. A woman described how she lost her virginity
at 15 to a group of soldiers. One woman said she fainted when her
attackers bit her breasts bloody while raping her. Another said she
was gang raped by 15 soldiers for three hours. Still another said
she was raped by more than 20 soldiers after they had killed her
mother in front of her.
</P>
<P>
   One woman said a neigbhor raped her.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was 20 years older, married,'' she testified. ``He laughed,
and I had the feeling he was doing it exactly because he knew me,
to cause me even more evil.''
</P>
<P>
   The women were forced at gunpoint to cook, clean, and do the
laundry when they weren't being raped. Soldiers sold them to others
for less than $100. Some women cried. Others tore their hair out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Muslims, we will show you!'' one soldier cried before
committing a rape.
</P>
<P>
   Heather Ryan, a lawyer with the Coalition for International
Justice, a private group that monitors the tribunal, said the case
is being watched closely around the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a legal perspective, the significance here is that it is
the first time that a charge of enslavement has been made in which
sexual abuse was the focus,'' said Ryan, who next month will leave
The Hague for a stint at the John F. Kennedy School of Government
at Harvard University.
</P>
<P>
   ``To prove crimes against humanity, you have to prove that there
was an organized and systematic attack on a civilian population.
This is the first time that sexual assault has been used as the
basis of a systematic attack. . .''
</P>
<P>
   When she was the United States ambassador to Austria, Swanee
Hunt, director of the Women and Public Policy Program at the
Kennedy School, dispatched some of her staff to take statements
from rape victims in the Bosnian war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The statements I read made me sick to my stomach, and I have a
strong constitution,'' said Hunt, who has worked extensively in the
Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   Armies have raped civilians throughout history, she said, but
rape was used differently in the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The language that was used had a genocidal context,'' said
Hunt. ``Soldiers would say to Muslim women they raped, `Now you'll
have a Serb baby.' ''
</P>
<P>
   That is exactly what is alleged in the indictment charging three
Serb soldiers, Radomir Kovac, 39, Dragoljub Kunarac, 39, and Zoran
Vukovic, 44, with crimes against humanity.
</P>
<P>
   One woman who refused their advances was allegedly beaten and
dragged into a room at the Hotel Zelengora. After Kunarac and
Vukovic raped her, they said she would ``give birth to Serb
babies,'' she testified. Another woman said that after Kunarac and
two other soldiers raped her, Kunarac humiliated her by saying
``they would never know whose son this was.'' She said Kunarac took
her back to her apartment and robbed her of what little money and
jewelry she had hidden.
</P>
<P>
   It was Kunarac who allegedly raped the 15-year-old even after he
had been wounded in battle.
</P>
<P>
   Kovac is alleged to have sold a 12-year-old girl he was
routinely raping to another soldier for less than $100. Kovac
allegedly made the 12-year-old and other women disrobe and dance
naked for him on a table. Kovac allegedly sold two other women to
soldiers from Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
   Not all Serb soldiers were heartless. Several women told
investigators of Serb soldiers who took pity on them and helped
them escape, often to Montenegro. After watching Kunarac allegedly
rape two women for six months, a Serb soldier who was disgusted by
his comrades took the women away to safety.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony that began two weeks ago is expected to go on for
another month, and there could be a verdict by the end of the year,
Sellers said. She said investigators are now in Kosovo, gathering
evidence for possibly similar charges there.
</P>
<P>
   War crimes investigators believe at least 20,000 women have been
raped in Balkan fighting over the last decade. Those telling their
stories at The Hague are the few and the brave.
</P>
<P>
   There is a certain poetic justice in the central role that women
are playing in this effort to hold men accountable for using rape
as an instrument of war. Sellers made the case happen. Two of the
three main prosecutors are women, as is the tribunal's chief
prosecutor. The presiding judge is Florence Mumba, a no-nonsense
jurist from Zambia.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are the Bosnian Muslim women who, day-in day-out,
climb onto the witness stand and confront their demons, and their
alleged assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The 23-year-old woman who said she was raped by Kunarac turned
to face him Tuesday afternoon. When asked by Peggy Kuo, the
prosecutor, to point out her attacker, the woman leveled her eyes,
and then her finger, at Kunarac.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Kuo asked her to say how often she had been raped.
</P>
<P>
   The woman paused, trying to recall all the times. Then she said,
more in resignation than anger, ``I don't think that is possible.''

 &HT;    AOL previews sleeker Net browser
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ This is not your big brother's Netscape browser.
</P>
<P>
   America Online introduced the preview version of its sleeker,
hipper Netscape 6 on Wednesday at the annual Internet World Trade
Show in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   AOL says the slimmer browser is part of its ``AOL Anywhere''
strategy that lets members access the Internet from any device. The
program is about half the size of earlier versions and works better
with digital set-top television boxes and Web-enabled cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   The browser can be downloaded free at the Netscape Web site
(www.netscape.com). It includes a new technology called sidebar.
Netscape describes sidebar as ``a skinny Web page'' users can
customize so it will deliver information tailored to their needs.
</P>
<P>
   It will continuously deliver news, stock quotes, weather, buddy
lists and other news, even when the main browser window is closed.
</P>
<P>
   The new Netscape may become a point of contention in the penalty
stage of the Microsoft antitrust case. AOL Chief Executive Steve
Case says the company wants to make Netscape Communications Corp.'s
Navigator the default browser in the service as soon as possible.
The company currently uses the Explorer browser by Microsoft, but
that contract runs out at the end of 2000. AOL now owns Netscape.
</P>
<P>
   One of the key findings during the trial was that Microsoft
illegally attempted to monopolize the Web browser market. The court
found ``the predatory course of conduct Microsoft has pursued since
June of 1995 has revived the dangerous probability that Microsoft
will attain monopoly power in a second market,'' the judge wrote.
Experts believe the addition of AOL's customers could revitalize
Netscape's market share.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft spokesman Jim Cullinan said AOL's announcement shows
``Netscape has and will continue to be strong competition'' and
that Microsoft has not prevented Netscape from getting ``its
product to consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Legal issues aside, Jupiter Communications Web technology
analyst Lydia Loizides said she's impressed with Netscape 6's
design.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is different,'' she said, ``and it's much different from
Communicator (Netscape's current browser product). They have gone
for a streamlined, modular and, I guess, you could call it a
futuristic look.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the most interesting aspect of the new browser was the
sidebar function.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like an organizer on your desktop _ it's like an
intelligent bookmark,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more stuff like this as you get technology
that lets you have a window you can load up from the server,'' says
Tom Andrus, vice president of product management for Atlanta-based
EarthLink Network.
</P>
<P>
   EarthLink already has a sidebarlike feature with its 5.0
software. ``Basically what we did was try and integrate it with our
personal start page and have that be able to stay with you while
you travel the Web,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   CNet was lukewarm in its praise for the product, which is still
in the preview stage. The CNet Web site (www.cnet.com) called the
product ``smart, stable and slick ... so far,'' but it also cited
download and installation problems. It advised: ``Netscape 6 ain't
soup yet, but it's off to a good start.''
</P>
<P>
   Jupiter's Loizides says developers may take advantage of the new
sidebar technology and build some interesting new products just for
Netscape 6.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait six months,'' she says. ``You'll see applications that
are designed just for the Netscape browser because of the open
standard that makes it a dream come true for developers, and you'll
see exclusives.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone is giddy about the new Netscape 6. In an online
article for Wired News called ``Netscape 6: Does Anybody Care?''
(www.wired.com
</P>
<P>
   /news/technology), Zona Research Executive Vice President Harry
Fenik said most users don't know or care what browser they use.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we were doing market studies, the most consistent
response we got was, `I don't care,''' Fenik said.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The rough stone emerges from the African soil at fortress-like
mines in the war zones of Angola or straight from the muck of a
dammed-up river in Congo. After journeying across continents and
oceans, after being graded, cut, polished and set in gold along the
way, a diamond lands in a display window in New York, transformed
into a pricey symbol of eternal love and beckoning to brides-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   The journey can take months or even years. To enforce the myth
that diamonds are rare and valuable, most of the world's rough
stones are hoarded in London and then carefully fed back into the
world market.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, the South African conglomerate that controls
two-thirds of the world's rough diamonds, decides how many will be
sold, when, to whom and at what price.
</P>
<P>
   Where they are mined responsibly, as in Botswana, South Africa
or Namibia, diamonds can contribute to development and stability.
But where governments are corrupt, rebels are pitiless and borders
are porous, as in Angola, Congo or Sierra Leone, the glittering
stones have become agents of slave labor, murder, dismemberment,
mass homelessness and wholesale economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   While market manipulation guarantees their price in world
markets, the portability and anonymity of diamonds _ millions of
dollars worth can be smuggled in a sock, and identifying where they
came out of the ground is often impossible _ have made them the
currency of choice for predators with guns in modern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't wage war without money, and diamonds are money,''
said Willy Kingombe Idi, who buys diamonds from diggers in Congo.
``People are fighting for money. Everything that happens, it's
about money.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers estimates that only 3 percent of global rough diamonds
now come from conflict areas in Africa, according to Andrew Lamont,
a company spokesman who repeatedly said it was difficult to define
a conflict area.
</P>
<P>
   But Christine Gordon, a London-based journalist and independent
diamond analyst who has been critical of De Beers, said that as
recently as the mid-1990s, diamonds from African war zones
accounted for 10 to 15 percent of the world supply.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, violent goings-on in diamond-rich Africa have done
nothing, thus far, to change the consuming habits of Americans, who
buy more than half the world's diamond jewelry. Sales jumped about
11 percent last year. Diamond sales are also booming around the
world, with De Beers showing record sales last year of more than $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORKERS: Digging in the Mud &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom rung of the international diamond trade, the need
to scrape together enough money to eat sends Africans like Mati
Balemo clawing through the mud of a Congolese streambed. Balemo is
a digger.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, he and six other diggers set off from
Kisangani, in north-central Congo, traveling first by bicycle taxi
and then on foot. Along the way, a soldier armed with a stubby
machine gun demanded to come along. He hired another bicycle taxi,
which took a spill on a hill, pleasing the diggers.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived after three hours at a small stream where the thick
canopy of bamboo and vines made the early afternoon as dark as
twilight. The diggers had been working this site for a month and
had found only a few diamonds. They used shovels to dam off small
sections of the stream. Then they heaped mounds of mud onto the
bank. They picked out big rocks from the mud and sifted through
what was left with metal screens nailed to wooden frames.
</P>
<P>
   Diggers like Balemo are driven by the dream of one stone that
will change their lives. For weeks or months, they work bent over
in shallow rivers or in pits. In Balemo's three years as a digger,
the biggest diamond he ever found was a stone of 2.16 carats worth
$800. That diamond, if it were of flawless color and clarity, could
retail for as much as $10,000 in New York, experts say. Balemo
split his $800 among five fellow diggers.
</P>
<P>
   Miki Galedem, 30, another digger who started when he was 16
years old, once found a monstrous stone of 9 carats. He was paid
$4,800. But he was young then, in 1993, and the money disappeared,
he said, on ``beer and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a pool of water stilled by mounds of mud, the
diggers professed not to think much about their business _ where
the diamonds go, who wears them and at what price. ``Diamonds are
beautiful,'' Balemo said. ``Everyone wants to be beautiful. That is
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was knee-deep in the stream, and had been sifting mud _ a
brown stew with pebbles and quartz _ for an hour. Suddenly, he
found a diamond. He popped it in his mouth to clean it and then
showed off a shiny white stone half the size of a raisin. His
friends clapped, and one digger guessed that traders back in
Kisangani would pay $20 at most for the stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad,'' Balemo said, not smiling much. This was the
first diamond in nearly a week. ``It's not much money for all that
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldier with the machine gun, who had been watching closely
from the riverbank, then came over and took the diamond. He folded
it into a scrap of paper backed with gold foil and stuffed the
packet into his chest pocket.
</P>
<P>
   By the rules of the Congo, the guy with the gun got the diamond.
Even when the stones are taken from the ground using the most
sophisticated equipment, the game is roughly the same.

<P>
   ANGOLA: Financing the Arms
</P>
<P>
   In northeastern Angola, the Catoca diamond mine _ one of a half
dozen such sites in that Texas-sized country _ is an island of
modernity in a sea of civil war. Massive earthmovers gouge out the
diamond-bearing earth and feed it into a sorting plant where water,
electric vibrators and X-rays separate out about $8 million worth
of diamonds a month _ a number expected to quadruple as the mine
expands.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds are stored in a high-security sorting room before
being flown to Europe. As technicians grade the uncut stones,
Israeli-trained security guards watch from every angle to make sure
that no one slips a rock into his pocket. The mine has satellite
television and 24-hour Internet access, but the only way in or out
is by air. To protect employees from attack, they are locked inside
the mine's gates every night by guards with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Until four years ago, the men with guns were rebel soldiers
working for Unita, the Angolan rebel group led by Jonas Savimbi.
Delfi Rui, a 39-year-old digger, recalled seeing rebels whip an
elderly man who refused to dig. He said they threatened to shoot
workers who would not give them at least half the diamonds they
found.
</P>
<P>
   The Angolan military took Catoca from Unita in 1996, and within
two years modern mining began atop one of the planet's largest
veins of diamonds. The mine now employs 1,100 Angolans and has the
potential to anchor an economic revival in a part of the country
where there are no other industries, no money for war
reconstruction and no government services. Employment at the mine
is expected to last for at least four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the persistence of fighting in the area means that men with
guns still find ways to milk the diamond business. A private
security force controlled by the chief of staff of the Angolan
army, Gen. Joao de Matos, protects Catoca. About 300 armed guards,
most of them former Angolan soldiers, have staked out a fortified
perimeter around the mine. They charge $500,000 a month to protect
the mine from Unita.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were driven from the mine, Unita soldiers have stayed
in the area and terrorized the local citizenry with hit-and-run
guerrilla raids. They have forced about 56,000 nearby civilians
from their homes. Most are destitute. Many have been maimed by land
mines. Without international food aid, they would starve.
</P>
<P>
   Unita's behavior led the United Nations to impose a diamond
embargo on the group in 1998, making it the only African rebel
force subjected to such action.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States and the apartheid government of
South Africa supported Unita as a counter to the Soviet-backed
Angolan government in Luanda. But with the end of the Cold War and
of apartheid, Unita lost its military patrons. International
isolation deepened when Savimbi lost an election in Angola 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than accept a vote that foreign observers judged free and
fair, Savimbi returned to the bush and resumed war against the
Angolan government. His fighters seized control of the Cuango River
valley, Angola's richest diamond territory, and began a major
mining operation that more than compensated for the lost Cold War
aid, and made them the richest rebels in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond money paid for Unita offensives that in the 1990s
elevated Angola's civil war to a new plateau of savagery. Highland
cities like Cuito and Huambo were all but flattened by artillery
shells. More than half a million Angolans were killed. Land mines
maimed about 90,000. Fighting displaced 4 million Angolans, and
about 1 million continue to depend on foreign food aid. The U.N.
Children's Fund now ranks Angola as the worst place on earth to be
a child.
</P>
<P>
   At Andulo, Unita's headquarters in the central highlands of
Angola, Savimbi personally haggled with arms merchants and diamond
traders who flew in from Europe. He bargained using small bags of
diamonds, each of which contained several million dollars worth of
gems, according to Robert R. Fowler, the Canadian ambassador to the
United Nations and chairman of a committee that investigated
violations of the embargo against Unita.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price was $22 million, Savimbi would reach down for
four of those bags and two of those,'' Fowler said. ``The arms
dealers had their diamond experts and Savimbi had his and they
would inspect the diamonds to see if they really were worth $22
million. And then they haggled some more and somebody would throw
in an extra bag of diamonds and off the arms dealers flew.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Savimbi became a major player on the international arms scene.
Giant Russian-made Il-76 cargo planes made as many as 22 deliveries
a night at Andulo, said Fowler. The primary source for most of the
arms was Bulgaria, the report said, although Bulgarian officials
deny it.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations waited nearly six years before imposing an
embargo on Unita diamonds, even though there was never any doubt
what Savimbi was doing with his little bags. With an estimated $3
billion in legal diamond sales, he built Unita into a highly mobile
war machine with 35,000 well-armed troops. By the early summer of
last year, Unita seemed on the verge of toppling the government in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were turned back only because the government went on
a $500-million weapons-buying spree of its own, financed by Western
oil companies that paid the government more than $900 million for
rights to new offshore oil finds.
</P>
<P>
   Although Unita's sales of diamonds are down sharply from the
mid-1990s, the U.N. report said that gems continue to play a
``uniquely important role'' for the rebels.

EX-ENVOY HITS ADMINISTRATION CAVE-IN TO HELMS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Corrects Jesse Helms' state in 2d graf)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A career diplomat long affiliated with the Democratic
Party blasted the Clinton administration Wednesday for attempting
to appease Senator Jesse Helms and other congressional
conservatives, saying the executive branch has traded away its
leadership in foreign policy and gotten nothing to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   J. Brian Atwood, who resigned as director of the US Agency for
International Development last year after it became clear Helms had
blocked his nomination to be ambassador to Brazil, said the
administration ``should have known better'' than to attempt to
appease the North Carolina archconservative.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect Senator Helms a great deal,'' Atwood said in a
speech to the United Nations Association of Greater Boston and the
Boston Committee on Foreign Relations. ``He is a man of his word.
His position has been known for years and he has never changed that
position. He is opposed to the United Nations. He is opposed to
international engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood works on international development issues for Joseph P.
Kennedy 2d's Citizens Energy Corp. He declined to fault
administration officials by name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know why we're taking the Security Council down to
Washington to meet (Helms),'' Atwood said. ``All that's going to do
is empower him. It's going to encourage his colleagues to say `We
can't get into this, Jesse's handling it.' Baloney!''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood said reducing US contributions to the United Nations may
be worth considering, but the way the United States is attempting
to do this is ill-advised and will harm the national interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United States is attemopting to accomplish this goal by
placing a legislatively imposed gun to the head of the General
Assembly,'' Atwood said. ``This is not a constructive way to
engage. This is not cooperation. This is an undisguised attempt to
blackmail. . . &UR;  &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we achieve in winning by blackmail?'' he asked. ``We
merely encourage others to use our methods. Do we want the
parliaments of Germany and Japan to hold back their UN payments
until those countries are made permanent members of the Security
Council?''

   CONGO: Creating a Wasteland
</P>
<P>
   There is no U.N. embargo on diamonds from Congo or Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger for looted diamonds is a major reason why six outside
states have sent soldiers into Congo, formerly Zaire. Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe have dispatched troops to protect the
government of President Laurent Kabila, while Burundi, Rwanda and
Uganda have sent soldiers to assist rebels seeking to overthrow
him.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, they have succeeded in shattering much of the
economy of eastern Congo, and transforming Kisangani, the major
city of eastern Congo, into a gaudy and ghostly ruin.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Kisangani are nearly empty of cars. The textile
plant is closed and the once-thriving port on the Congo River is
quiet. Apart from spotty electricity from a hydroelectric dam,
there are hardly any public services left. Public salaries go
unpaid. Prices have soared.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The only businesses that seem alive are those buying diamonds
from diggers coming in from the dense forest that encircles
Kisangani. To catch their eye, storefronts have been dressed in
garish paint that shouts the names of diamond buyers like Mr. Cash,
Jihad the King of Diamonds and Jehovah Ire, run by one Papa Samuel,
``in connection with Jesus Christ.'' One store is painted with an
image of the Sylvester Stallone movie character Rambo, his machine
gun replaced with a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the diamond shops, it is possible to see hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of stones. Shop owners say the diamonds
are often flown out of Congo to Rwanda or Uganda, as commanders
from those countries reward themselves for their revolutionary
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think is the reason for this war?'' asked a
diamond buyer named Papa Ben, who plies his trade in Kisangani.
``It's only about the riches of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about a third of Congo's annual diamond production is being
sold through the country's official market, according to diamond
experts in Antwerp, Belgium. They say the rest is being smuggled
away for sale in bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest diamond prize in the Congo is more than 1,000
miles to the southwest of Kisangani, near the city of Mbuji Mayi.
Diamond experts say Kabila has allocated a substantial percentage
of that huge diamond complex to Zimbabwe, which has dispatched
11,000 troops to prop up Kabila's wobbly regime.
</P>
<P>
   So Zimbabwe has recently become a major diamond exporter,
although it has a negligible local industry.
</P>
<P>
   With their eyes on the prize at Mbuji Mayi, large numbers of
Congolese rebels and supporting troops from Rwanda began massing
about a year ago to the north and east of the city. If they take
the diamond mines there, many military analysts believe, Zimbabwe
would lose its will to fight and Kabila's regime would probably
fall.

<P>
   SIERRA LEONE: Allying With Smugglers
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, the surgeons were
frantic. Scores of men, women and children, their hands partially
chopped off by machetes, had flooded the main hospital. Amputating
as quickly as they could, doctors tossed severed hands into a
communal bucket.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front, a rebel outfit that barters
diamonds for weapons, was trying early last year to conquer
Freetown. Chopping off limbs was their trademark strategy, as it
greatly simplified conquest in the diamond fields of eastern Sierra
Leone. When word got out that rebels were moving in, tens of
thousands of terrified people would take off. The rebels chased
half the country's population of 4.5 million out of their homes in
the 1990s. Half a million people fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One day during last year's carnage in Freetown, a diamond trader
approached a reporter at the Cape Sierra Hotel. He stuck out his
tongue and from beneath it plucked out a stone, which he offered to
sell. When no sale took place, the trader popped the diamond back
in his mouth and moved on.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Most of Sierra Leone's diamonds were _ and still are _ smuggled
into neighboring Liberia for sale, according to several human
rights groups and diamond industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Sierra Leone rebels, Foday Sankoh, has
established a lucrative partnership with his longtime Liberian
friend, Charles Taylor, the rebel-boss-turned-president. Both had
training in Libya, both their rebellions began in the late 1980s,
and their armies have helped each other fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's access to the world's diamond bourses and to arms was
secured when Taylor was elected president of Liberia in 1997.
Sankoh and the Liberian government deny this trade.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of diplomats, international relief officials and
mining experts say there is persuasive evidence. Liberia was a
marginal exporter of diamonds until the mid-1990s. Since then it
has it exported some 31 million carats _ more than 200 years worth
of its own national capacity, according to trading records in
Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   After Sankoh failed to take Freetown last year, he signed a
peace deal granting his rebels amnesty for war crimes. The deal,
which was brokered by the United Nations, also gave him a
government job _ chairman of the Strategic Minerals Commission,
which controls diamond mining.

   BOTSWANA: Where Diamonds Bring Benefits
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds need not lead to horror. Botswana, the world's largest
diamond producer, is one of the most stable and prosperous
countries in Africa. The diamond industry there employs nearly a
fourth of the country's 1.5 million people and accounts for
two-thirds of government income.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers and the government control the industry in a 50-50
partnership, but there is far more to the country's success than
corporate paternalism. First of all, the borders of Botswana _
unlike the borders of many African countries _ make sense. Inside
Botswana's borders, there is ethnic and linguistic unity, and a
long history of democratic decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional chiefs rarely take action without first consulting
ordinary villagers, who are invited to speak freely. The fact that
Botswana gained independence peacefully has also helped. The
country was so poor that the British decided it was not worth
fighting for, so it was never inundated with guns or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   When De Beers discovered diamonds in Botswana in 1969, the
government had been independent for three years and the men running
it were traditional chiefs who owned cattle. They came from a
desert culture where people have to scrimp and save to survive the
long, dry season.
</P>
<P>
   During three decades, Botswana's leaders have carefully guided
what became the world's fastest-growing economy. They invested in
roads, schools and clinics. In stark contrast to the rulers of
Angola and Congo, they created an African nation devoted to
improving the lives of its people. In 1965, the year before
independence, only about half of primary-school-aged children
attended school. Today, 90 percent of that group is enrolled. Life
expectancy, which was less than 50 at independence, is now near 70.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, phones work, potholes get repaired, garbage gets
picked up and a lively press pokes fun at the government without
fear. At $3,600 per year, the gross national product per capita is
seven times higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The
standard of living is higher in Botswana than in South Africa,
Turkey or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds are not devils,'' said Terry Lynn Karl, a professor
of political science at Stanford University and the author of ``The
Paradox of Plenty,'' a book about the poisonous mix of natural
resources, big money and thieving elites in developing countries.
``What matters is that there be a tradition of good government and
compromise in place prior to the exploitation of these resources.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HISTORY: Exploiting a Continent
</P>
<P>
   The miseries of modern Africa are, in many ways, a legacy of its
history.
</P>
<P>
   In Angola and Congo, colonialism obliterated whatever political
culture may have pre-dated the arrival of Europeans. It invented
huge, largely fictive nations roping together people who regarded
each other as foreigners. To make their nation-building pay,
colonialists used force to haul off everything from ivory to rubber
to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, the Belgian colonial state was famously greedy and
cruel. Its agents set impossible quotas for production of rubber
and ivory, killing or chopping off the hands of villagers who
failed to meet them. Novelist Joseph Conrad called it ``the vilest
scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   In Angola, the Portuguese were less brutal, but no less toxic.
At independence in 1975, several hundred thousand Portuguese
residents, virtually the entire educated population, abandoned the
country. Some took their doorknobs with them. They left behind a
place where almost no Angolans had any training in statecraft,
business or agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   And for most of the last half century, the Cold War and the
white-minority regimes of southern Africa injected cash and arms
into regional wars.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, for example, supported Unita in the early 1970s and
again in the late 1980s. Angola's Marxist government received
military assistance from the Soviet Union and up to 50,000 troops
from Cuba. When the CIA was not helping Unita, the rebels got
military backup from white-ruled South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, a small country in West Africa, had a more benign
colonial history under British rule. But since the 1940s, predators
who smuggle diamonds have warped every aspect of the nation's
economic and political life.
</P>
<P>
   The meddling of colonialists, superpowers and white regimes all
but stopped at the start of the 1990s, leaving diamonds, oil and
other natural resources as the primary forage for rebels and
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the countries where there was nothing to trade for weapons _
as in Mozambique, where post-apartheid South Africa stopped funding
rebellion and post-communist Eastern Europe stopped funding the
government _ war simply fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
   But Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone had plenty of diamonds left
over to excite greed, fuel war and to buy favors.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N. report on the embargo against Unita described how
Savimbi gave a ``passport sized'' packet of diamonds to the
president of Togo, Gnassingbe Eyedema, as payment for allowing his
children to live in Togo and go to school there. Togo has denied
it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Savimbi ``sealed'' his friendship with the president of Burkina
Faso, Blaise Compaore, by giving him a number of envelopes full of
diamonds, as well as contributing to his political campaign and
helping his government pay debts, according to the report. In
return, it said that Burkina Faso sent Savimbi three flights of
diesel fuel. The government of Burkina Faso denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the diamonds, diamonds, diamonds,'' said a character in
Graham Greene's ``The Heart of the Matter,'' a 1948 novel set in
Sierra Leone. ``You cannot understand how many bribes are
necessary.''

 &HT;    Coca-Cola shares fall 8% despite Daft's talk
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola shares fell $4.12 1/2, or 8 percent,
Wednesday on both short-term and long-term concerns about the
company's prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic decline to $47.62 1/2 came only a day after
Chairman Doug Daft and other executives traveled to Wall Street to
explain their strategy to some 250 beverage analysts and money
managers.
</P>
<P>
   But the company got a sell-off instead of the buy-in it was
hoping for.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect investors to restrain enthusiasm for KO (Coca-Cola's
stock ticket symbol) until actual evidence of volume and earnings
growth acceleration begins to materialize,'' analyst Marc Cohen of
Goldman, Sachs wrote Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Jennifer Solomon of Salomon Smith Barney on Wednesday
lowered her 12-month target to $60 a share, from $70, ``given the
disappointing first-quarter volume trends as well as the fact that
KO is now in a 'show me' situation,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The analysts were disappointed in Coca-Cola's announcement
Tuesday that its first-quarter volume, or case sales, will increase
about 3 percent worldwide, and only 1.5 percent excluding the
recent acquisition of Cadbury Schweppes brands in 161 nations
outside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``KO's volume recovery is developing at a slower-than-expected
pace,'' Cohen wrote as he lowered his 2000 earnings estimate by 2
cents a share to $1.43.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to disappointing first-quarter case sales, analysts
also think the company is being overly ambitious with its long-term
growth targets.
</P>
<P>
   At this week's meeting, Daft said the company will be able to
produce long-term volume growth of 7 percent to 8 percent annually,
and earnings-per-share growth of about 15 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
   But several analysts disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goals described by management ... continue to be
challenging in our view,'' Cohen wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Solomon agreed with Cohen. ``We think 12-14 percent EPS
(earnings per share) and 5-6 percent volume is more appropriate, ''
she said.

   DE BEERS: Manipulating Scarcity
</P>
<P>
   De Beers created its cartel 110 years ago when the company's
founder, Cecil Rhodes, realized that the sheer abundance of
diamonds in southern Africa would make them virtually worthless. By
carefully manipulating scarcity, De Beers prospered as perhaps the
most powerful cartel in the annals of modern commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, however, De Beers has run afoul of U.S.
antitrust laws. The company's senior executives dare not enter the
United States because of an outstanding antitrust indictment that
charges De Beers with fixing the prices of industrial diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The company's grip on the diamond market has slipped a bit from
near-total dominance at mid-century, but it has continued to keep
the price of gem-quality diamonds high by being both aggressive and
flexible. Through the years, De Beers has sponged up periodic
floods of diamonds from Russia, Australia and, until recently,
across parts of war-torn Africa where it does not own all the
mines.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the artificial perception of rarity, what makes
diamonds profitable to more than 2.5 million miners, traders,
cutters and wholesalers around the world _ and what energizes the
$50-billion-a-year retail diamond jewelry industry _ is romance.
</P>
<P>
   That, for the most part, is also an invention of De Beers. In
1938, De Beers hired a New York advertising firm to convince
millions of couples that the larger the diamond on an engagement
ring, the greater their love. In the 1960s, a similar campaign in
Japan created a diamond engagement ring ``tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds spilling out of Angola's war zone have had a
destabilizing effect on the cartel, first by increasing the supply
of gem-quality stones and then by tarring the reputation of De
Beers as a company that trafficked in blood-stained goods.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain world prices, De Beers bought up a sizable amount of
what Unita was selling _ although the company insists it bought the
diamonds on the open market without any direct dealings with the
rebels, and that it stopped all buying when the embargo was imposed
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Global Witness, a London-based human rights group, embarrassed
De Beers in October 1998 with a report that showed _ citing the
company's own annual reports _ how the cartel had pumped large
amounts of money into the coffers of the rebels as the war
escalated.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, De Beers took decisive action. The company
declared last October that it would not buy any diamonds that
originate in Angola, except from one government-controlled mine.
</P>
<P>
   Some diamond analysts said De Beers' announcement, while
laudable, came late _ after Unita, having exhausted the easy
pickings in Angola's alluvial mines and having lost considerable
territory to Angolan government forces, could no longer roil the
world market with high quality stones.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers moved again in March to sanitize the image of the
diamonds it sells. As of March 26, the company says it can
guarantee that none of its diamonds originate with African rebels,
but come instead from its own mines in South Africa, Botswana or
Namibia, or are bought from mines in Russia or Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have welcomed De Beers' moves and praise the
company for taking steps they say the entire diamond industry
should follow. Rebel-mined diamonds, though, can still find their
way out of Africa. About a third of diamonds imported into the
United States are purchased from traders who are not employed by De
Beers and are not bound by its new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ANTWERP: Tracing the Stones
</P>
<P>
   Near Antwerp's train station, police barricades seal off three
narrow streets. In warren-like rooms above the streets, men hunch
over precision turntables, grinding rough diamonds to coax forth
shapes and colors that lure wholesaler jewelers to Belgium from
around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Eight out of 10 of the world's rough diamonds _ about 125
million carats a year _ pass through Antwerp's Diamond Center. But
exactly which of those stones come from war zones in Africa is
something Antwerp's experts say they find hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vaughan, managing director of the Diamantkring, one of
the four exchanges in Antwerp, said his business depends on trust,
and that if diamonds have been smuggled by African rebels and
re-packaged elsewhere, ``We don't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many diamond traders in Antwerp don't particularly want to know
where the stones come from. A recent U.N. report complained of
``extremely lax regulations'' at the world's largest diamond bourse
in Antwerp. A Canadian human rights group, Partnership Africa
Canada, calls Antwerp ``a diamond smuggler's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgium has objected to the report, saying it ignores major
moves in January to set up tougher customs inspections and a new
certification system with the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Belgium. According to the U.N. report,
Antwerp is flooded with diamonds exported from countries passing
off smuggled diamonds as their own, complete with false, but
official, certificates of origin. The experts say these countries
include Liberia, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   One way to keep rebel-mined diamonds off the world market would
be to impose a diamond embargo on African countries known to be
exporting smuggled stones. Thus far, though, there is little
enthusiasm in the United Nations for such a move. ``It is tough
enough in Angola, believe me,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and some members of Congress are also
calling for a mandatory diamond labeling system. One proposal calls
for a worldwide ban on sales unless diamonds have verifiable
documents proving country of origin. A bill introduced in Congress
last year would require similar documentation for diamonds sold in
the United States.

 UNDATED: United States.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., introduced
the bill after seeing the horrors of war in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world looked the other way in Angola for most of the
1990s, while revenues from diamond sales were used to butcher
innocent civilians,'' Wolf said. ``We should not stand by as the
same thing happens in Sierra Leone and Congo. We should do whatever
it takes to cut off the flow of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The diamond industry in the United States objects to the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to tell where a diamond comes from,'' said Eli
Haas, president of the Diamond Dealers Club of New York. ``Diamonds
don't have identifying marks and probably never will. You just
can't look at a diamond and say, yes, it comes from Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. De Beers says that it is ``actively
pursuing'' a diamond fingerprinting technology being developed by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a forensic laboratory in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Using lasers, the technology tries to identify chemical
impurities that are characteristic of diamonds from a particular
country. Before it can work, though, a huge database containing the
fingerprints of the world's diamonds would have to be gathered and
a method of industrial testing would have to be devised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identifying them is going to take many years,'' said Andrew
Bone, a De Beers spokesman in London. ``Most international experts
believe that the techniques are not yet sufficient to allow the
tracing of individual stones. Nevertheless, we are committed to
helping in any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MARKET: Buying Tokens of Love
</P>
<P>
   It appears likely, then, that a trickle of diamonds from the war
zones of Africa will continue to leak into jewelry stories, at
least until technology, international law or a heretofore unseen
vigilance in the diamond industry finds a way to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers insists that the chances of buying such a diamond are
infinitesimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less than a one-in-a-hundred chance that any single
stone will come from conflict areas,'' said Bone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such assurances, the window remains open for African
rebels. Smugglers in Sierra Leone and Congo have ready access to
the third of the world diamond market that De Beers doesn't
control. And Unita, although its diamond dealing is down sharply
from the mid-1990s, is still selling between $80 and $150 million
worth of stones a year, according to the most conservative
estimates. To perk up sales, Unita held a sale last year, military
experts said, marking down rough diamonds prices by a third.
</P>
<P>
   The perceived need to own a diamond appears, if anything, to be
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday afternoon, Tracy Scholl, of Suffolk County,
N.Y., stood with her fiance, Mike Sabatino, at an engagement ring
counter on 47th Street in Manhattan's diamond district.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get engaged, you get a diamond,'' said Scholl as
Sabatino, an electrician from Staten Island, warily eyed a
one-carat ring that cost $5,500. ``It is what you are supposed to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Africa? ``I want to say that I would not want a diamond
because of that stuff in Africa, but I guess that's not really
true,'' said Scholl. ``Me not buying a diamond is not going to stop
what is going on over there.''

   DEMS-GOP-ELIAN (Washington) _ Democratic National Chairman
Joseph J. Andrew, seeking to bolster Vice President Al Gore's
campaign in Florida, accuses the state's Republican Party of
exploiting the bitter custody battle over 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez. Andrew releases a GOP fund-raising letter telling

   PATAKI-LAZIO (Washington) _ Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., says a
thumbs down from New York Gov. George Pataki would make it
virtually impossible for him to challenge New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for the Republican senatorial nomination. Pataki appeared
to oblige him, saying in Albany that ``it's not particularly

support Giuliani. By DAN FREEDMAN. (Already filed.)

   BLACK-PHOTOGRAPHERS (Washington) _ ``Reflections in Black: A
History of Black Photographers, 1840 to the Present,'' an
exhibition through June 30 at the Arts and Industries building of
the Smithsonian Institution here, is a history with a provocative
notion at its core: that at various times, but especially in the
first several decades of the 20th century, American blacks used
photography to resist the image the dominant culture imposed on
them. Without a common program, perhaps even without a fully
conscious intent, people all over the nation devised a way to see
themselves as they were or wished to be, no matter what white
society had in mind. By Vicki Goldberg. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   JOE-GOULD'S-SECRET-FILM (Undated) _ ``Joe Gould's Secret'' is an
odd book to want to make a movie of. It is a classic of sorts, by
one of the most revered of the old New Yorker writers, Joseph
Mitchell; and until the book-length version was republished
recently by the Modern Library, copies of the original magazine
articles, bleary from over-Xeroxing, were passed around in certain
circles like samizdat. Stanley Tucci, produced, directed and star
in ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' which opened Friday. He and his
screenwriter, Howard A. Rodman, have created a film version that is
earnest and intelligent and, for the most part, painstakingly
faithful to the facts. By Charles McGrath. (Moved).  &QL;

<P>
   DUCHOVNY-FILMS (Los Angeles) _ It's a Tuesday morning on the set
of ``The X-Files'' and David Duchovny is working three jobs. He has
just changed out of his FBI agent suit _ the uniform for the
brooding but sartorially conformist Fox Mulder _ into an orange
T-shirt and jeans, director chic. A Princeton undergraduate, Yale
graduate, Manhattan, Scots-Jewish, Leo, he enjoys contact sports
and yoga. At this point no one knows for sure how much longer
Duchovny will be a part of ``The X-Files,'' Fox's most popular
drama series, or even if this is the show's last season altogether.
They just know he's been spending a lot of time publicizing his new
movie, ``Return to Me,'' a romantic comedy about a heart
transplant. Is film his future? Or can he never escape the
identification with Mulder, a strangely emotionless man obsessed by
government conspiracies, space aliens and his sister? And most
important, is he a truly talented actor or just a really lucky guy
who got cast as the one character he was born to play? By Anita
Gates. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   CORPORATE-FILMS (Undated) _ Midway through ``Erin Brockovich,''
I began to peel off from that hugely likable movie and consider its
curious new genre, whose template has already hardened. Once again,
as in ``The Rainmaker'' and ``A Civil Action,'' a David law firm
was suing a Goliath corporation on behalf of the company's victims.
Once again, the corporation was responding with a conspiracy of
silence and intimidation. And once again I had that uneasy feeling
that something was missing: a credible, complex opponent. By

   OM-PURI-FILMS (New York) _ Although Om Puri has appeared, by his
own estimate, in something like 140 films in his 24-year screen
career and has been characterized by one expert on Indian cinema as
``the finest actor of the post-independence generation,'' he does
not expect to be recognized on the streets of New York. But when he
and I step out for a cigarette in front of the SoHo Grand Hotel, a
middle-aged man and woman strolling up West Broadway look startled,
walk a few steps farther up the street, and then, after a fast
conference, return to tell Puri how impressed they had been by his
performance in ``East Is East'' (opening Friday), which they had
seen in Israel. By Terrence Rafferty. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   ZE'EVA-COHEN-DANCE (New York) _ The dances of the Israeli-born
choreographer Ze'eva Cohen focus on women, contemporary, ancient
and mythical. Some of the women are feisty, some are noble. All,
ultimately, are tragic: they dance as an act of resistance against
straitened circumstance or passing time, as if they were singing
private songs in a desert. Five of the 40 works Cohen has
choreographed since 1968, collected under the title ``Female
Mythologies,'' will be performed at Danspace Project in St. Mark's
Church in Manhattan from Thursday through Sunday. By Mindy Aloff.

<P>
   HAYLEY-MILLS-THEATER (Undated) _ Given her theatrical pedigree,
Hayley Mills must be aware of more than a few show business maxims.
For example: try to avoid following a tough act, and, there is no
tougher act than a cute kid. But what happens when you're your own
toughest act to follow? In one way, Mills has already found out,
having worked on the London stage for the last 30 years. But in
this country she is still best known as that saucer-eyed little
girl in such popular Disney films as ``Pollyanna'' (for which she
won a special 1960 Academy Award), ``The Parent Trap'' (1961) and
``That Darn Cat'' (1965). If Mills has her way, her New York stage
debut will begin the third act of what has already been a long
career. The London-born actress, who turns 54 next week, opens
Monday at the Lucille Lortel Theater in ``Noel Coward's Suite in
Two Keys,'' an evening of two one-act plays directed by John
Tillinger. By Steven Drukman. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

<P>
   WILD-PARTY-THEATER (New York) _ In the summer of 1926, Joseph
Moncure March, something of a rebel at 26, sat down at a battered
kitchen table in his airless $20-a-month walkup on West 14th Street
in Manhattan to write a narrative in verse about ``a lot of people
getting drunk at a party,'' a subject he had come to know very
well. The result, ``The Wild Party,'' is, as almost everyone knows
by now, the source and title of two musicals this season: one, by
Andrew Lippa, ends its run this Sunday at the Manhattan Theater
Club at City Center; the other, co-produced by the Joseph Papp
Public Theater, is to open on Thursday at the Virginia Theater on
Broadway. With music and lyrics by Michael John LaChiusa and
directed by George C. Wolfe, it stars Mandy Patinkin, Toni Collette

   GARLAND-WORLD-MUSIC-BOOK (Undated) _ The Garland World Music
Encyclopedia, a projected 10-volume series of telephone-book-size
reference works from Routledge started appearing in 1998. Six
volumes have been published; the two volumes just released, on
Europe and South Asia, are up to the level set by their
predecessors, on Africa, Southeast Asia, Australia and the Pacific
Islands and South America, Mexico, Central America and the
Caribbean. Don't spend too much time fussing here about the loaded
term ``world music.'' In this case it is not a naive stand-in for
``music that North Americans consider foreign''; it literally means
music made all over the world, including here. By Ben Ratliff.

<P>
   STIG-ANDERSEN-MUSIC (Houston) _ One last question for Stig
Andersen (the G is silent), the athletic tenor from Denmark.
Suppose singing had not worked out. What would he have done
instead? ``I am a ceramicist,'' he answers. ``I make pots. I like
to work against some resistance. I don't like clay that's too soft
or too weak. I have to have something to grab.'' This exchange took
place recently backstage at the Houston Grand Opera, where Andersen
was appearing in ``Tristan und Isolde.'' In jeans and a biker's
jacket, looking less tall but stouter in person than onstage, he
still seemed an exceptionally plausible physical match for Wagner's
Siegfried, the role that takes him to the Metropolitan Opera in
Manhattan for his house debut on Saturday afternoon. By Matthew
Gurewitsch. (Moved). WITH PHOTO. &QL;

   CHINESE-STOOLS-ART (New York) _ William Lipton remembers the
first time he saw Chinese stools. It was the late 1950s, and he was
5. A pair of barrel-shaped stools, in blue and white porcelain,
flanked the sofa in his grandmother's parlor in Dallas. Lipton has
no idea today what became of the stools, family heirlooms that were
trophies of a trip around the world made by a
great-great-grandfather in 1887. Then, on a first visit to China in
1979, when Lipton was a textile designer working for Jim Thompson
Ltd. in Bangkok, stools loomed large again. In Beijing he saw a
towering pile of weathered wood stools, with elegantly carved
aprons and legs, with hoof feet, scrolled feet and flat feet
protruding here and there from a stack that looked like a bizarre
offering to the gods of good taste. The memory of that scene stayed
with him. He became an antiques dealer in 1989, ultimately
specializing in Chinese furniture. Four years ago he began to
assemble as many examples of stools ``with personality'' as he
could find for a show on a form of furniture that is the most
humble and versatile of all in China but is rarely exhibited. He
selected 92 of them for ``The Wondrous and Amenable Chinese
Stool,'' an exhibition at his shop, William Lipton Ltd., in
Manhattan, through April 22. By Rita Reif. (Moved).  &QL;

   TV-MEN-COMEDIES (Undated) _ Men in a growing number of comedies
are depicted as rude, crude, sex-crazed, sexist, childish and
blindly egotistical. The curmudgeonly title character of ``Becker''
(Ted Danson), a middle-aged doctor, says things like: ``If you want
to know about women, you don't ask a woman. If you want to know
about meat, do you ask a cow?'' On ``Friends,'' Joey eats steak
with his fingers at Ross's wedding reception. Prime time gives us
grown men who can't stop giggling in church, bawdy male magazine
publishers married to women half their age and men who stick
Montblanc pens up their noses in order to meet women in the
emergency room. Anyone who watches television regularly could get
the impression that one of the two sexes on this planet is not only
dimwitted and uncouth but darned proud of it. By Anita Gates.

DOUBTS ABOUT LEWIS DIAGNOSIS VOICED AT TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and s coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SACHA PFEIFFER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ During tense, combative testimony, the former
supervisor of Gilbert H. Mudge Jr., the doctor who announced
publicly that Reggie Lewis had a benign fainting condition that
would not end his basketball career, said Wednesday that he had
doubts about Mudge's diagnosis and worried that, if Mudge were
wrong, Lewis could die.
</P>
<P>
   Testifying for the first time in the case, which ended in a hung
jury last year, Dr. Eugene Braunwald said he questioned Mudge's
diagnosis, which was at odds with the conclusion reached by a team
of preeminent cardiologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``I questioned his degree of certainty,'' said Braunwald, a
cardiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital who chaired the
hospital's medical department when Lewis was under Mudge's care in
1993. ``I thought he might be right, but I wasn't as confident and
sure as he seemed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Mudge ``seemed to think this was open and shut. . . but I wasn't
all that certain,'' added Braunwald, testifying on the third day of
the retrial in the medical malpractice lawsuit stemming from the
Celtics star's July 1993 death.
</P>
<P>
   ``You knew that if he was wrong, Mr. Lewis's life was in
jeopardy, didn't you?'' asked Neil Rossman, the lawyer representing
Lewis's widow, Donna Harris-Lewis, who sued Mudge for wrongful
death after her 27-year-old husband died of heart failure three
months after he came under Mudge's care.
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald paused for several seconds, then replied, ``That's
right.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald, who was not called to the stand during the first
trial, was clearly a reluctant witness. Called as a plaintiff's
witness by Rossman, Braunwald acknowledged that he had refused to
meet with Rossman or take his phone calls prior to his courtroom
appearance. And throughout Rossman's questioning, Braunwald was
frequently argumentative and uncooperative, prompting the judge to
intercede several times and ask him to answer the questions posed
to him.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange that lasted at least 10 minutes and prompted
laughs from the jury, Rossman tried to get Braunwald to concede
that neurocardiogenic syncope _ the fainting condition Mudge said
Lewis had _ is not a medical condition that can cause death.
Braunwald insisted that if a person experienced neurocardiogenic
syncope while crossing a street and fainted in front of a truck, he
could indeed die.
</P>
<P>
   ``But doctor,'' Rossman finally asked, ``neurocardiogenic
syncope alone won't kill you, right?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's right,'' Braunwald said.
</P>
<P>
   But Braunwald also testified that while he asked Mudge if he
felt ``all that certain'' about his fainting diagnosis, which Mudge
announced at a May 1993 press conference, Mudge told him privately
that he was also considering a second diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   A central component of Mudge's defense is that despite his claim
at the press conference that Lewis suffered only from a fainting
disorder, he also believed Lewis might have a cardiac arrhythmia, a
potentially lethal heart condition. Indeed, at the first trial,
Mudge testified that he, the Lewises, hospital officials, and
Celtics representatives had a ``calculated plan'' to conceal the
second, more worrisome diagnosis from the public.
</P>
<P>
   Harris-Lewis has testified that Mudge never told her or her
husband that he could have a life-threatening disorder.
</P>
<P>
   During his questioning of Braunwald, Rossman established that
nowhere in Lewis's Brigham medical records was there any indication
that Mudge believed he suffered from an arrhythmia.
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald appeared more composed under questioning by Mudge's
attorney, William J. Dailey Jr., who asked him to elaborate on why
he had called Lewis's medical case ``challenging'' and
``difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald noted that multiple tests run on Lewis had yielded
conflicting data, forcing doctors to ``try to sort out a lot of
evidence, some of which was contrary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't a clear set of signals that we received from the
patient,'' he added. ``That's what made the case very, very
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   Braunwald also noted that a person can suffer from
neurocardiogenic syncope and arrhythmia simultaneously, further
complicating efforts to diagnose Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that Mudge had said during the press conference that
``medicine is an art, not a science,'' Dailey asked Braunwald if it
is ``true that medicine is not a precise science?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You bet,'' Braunwald replied.
</P>
<P>
   Dailey's questioning went to the core of a key issue the jury
will have to consider: in medical malpractice cases, juries are
told it is not enough to find that a doctor made a mistake. They
must find that the care deviated from ``acceptable standards of
practice.''

JAPAN'S NEW PREMIER DESCRIBED AS ADEPT BUT INDECISIVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With JAPAN-POLITICS) 
 By CALVIN SIMS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ In Nagatacho, Tokyo's political hub, Yoshiro Mori, who
was elected prime minister Wednesday, is often referred to as ``an
elephant with a flea's heart,'' a reference to his 220-pound frame
and what many of his critics say is his indecisiveness, especially
under fire.
</P>
<P>
   Mori, 62, has held several cabinet posts, including the trade
and education portfolios, and is considered an adept political
operator who has been in parliament for more than 30 years. Lately
he has played a pivotal role in keeping the Liberal Democratic
Party's coalition, one of the largest in decades, intact.
</P>
<P>
   He is also said to have especially warm relations with New
Komeito, a Buddhist-backed party whose strength is greater than the
Liberals, which recently splintered from the government coalition.
</P>
<P>
   What Mori does not have is experience in either the foreign or
finance ministries, two government powerhouses where several of his
predecessors have served.
</P>
<P>
   Those deficiencies, together with his reputation for blunt talk
that has got him in trouble in the past, have prompted some to
question whether he is little more than an interim leader until a
general election can be called.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's lack of broad experience may be an immediate handicap
given the fact that as the world's second-largest economic power,
Japan is in frequent contact with foreign officials and that it is
scheduled to be host at the annual summit meeting of the world's
leading economic powers in Okinawa in July. The meeting will
include Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin, whom Mori is now
expected to meet later this month, his first overseas trip as prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
   But Mori's domestic policy views are not well known either. And
like many politicians of his generation, he has steadily climbed
the political ladder here by staying assiduously loyal to the
leadership of the dominant party, the Liberal Democrats, not by
staking out policy initiatives or specialties.
</P>
<P>
   When he has attracted attention it was usually for some misstep
like the time his blunt language or a flip remark got him into hot
water.
</P>
<P>
   In January, he apologized to AIDS patients after he likened them
to unwelcomed guests. ``When I visited a village, all farmers out
in the fields went home, as if AIDS had come in town,'' he was
reported to have said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, he angered many people in Okinawa by saying that
teachers there opposed the government's new policy of requiring the
national anthem at functions because they were ``controlled by
Communists'' and ``oppose everything the government does.''
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday night, Mori said that his
comments on Okinawans and AIDS patients were taken out of context.
</P>
<P>
   His career also has not been without scandal. In the late 1980s,
he was implicated in a major stocks-for-favor scandal known as
Recruit that illuminated the Liberal Democratic Party's history of
cronyism and corruption, and toppled Prime Minister Noboru
Takeshita.
</P>
<P>
   Back then Mori admitted making more than $950,000 by selling
shares that he had acquired in a company before it went public. At
his first news conference Wednesday night as prime minister, Mori
seemed to brush aside the 11-year-old scandal and his role in it by
characterizing it as a ``regular business transaction,'' a remark
that struck some as a sweeping oversimplification and dangerously
cavalier.
</P>
<P>
   Before being named prime minister, Mori, a former college rugby
player, held the Liberal Democratic Party's No. 2 position as
secretary-general and was a close ally of his longtime friend
Obuchi, whom he met on the college debate team.

   ``When continuity is most important, you need someone like Mori
who is colorless and can fit into any kind of mold,'' said Yukio
Okamoto, a political consultant. ``Because he is not biased in his
ideology and political beliefs, he can change according to the
situation. He was a safe bet because he epitomizes middle of the
road.''
</P>
<P>
   While members of Mori's party praised his selection as prime
minister, some opposition party legislators ridiculed it.
</P>
<P>
   Hiroshi Kawauchi, a lawmaker belonging to the Democratic Party,
which is not part of the Mori's coalition, said, ``I think he's
better suited to be a sumo wrestling stable master than prime
minister of a country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the news conference Mori clearly signaled that he would make
no major changes. He offered no new policy agenda but vowed to
continue Obuchi's economic plan. He also retained Obuchi's cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will aim to achieve a government that would walk with the
people and is trusted by the people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He said that he had no immediate plans to call elections,
despite the rumors Wednesday that the party was considering moving
them up to take advantage of public sympathy over Obuchi's massive
stroke.
</P>
<P>
   Mori was born on July 14, 1937, to a family of middle-class rice
farmers in Neagari, a rural town in Ishikawa Prefecture on the
coast of the Sea of Japan. Politics ran in the family, and both
Mori's father and grandfather served as mayor of Neagari.
</P>
<P>
   Mori graduated from prestigious Waseda University where he
majored in commerce and pursued his boyhood passion for rugby. But
an illness forced him to give up the sport, and on a whim he joined
the debating club where he met Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
   After working briefly as a newspaper reporter in the early
1960s, Mori started his political career as secretary to a Lower
House member and was first elected to the Diet in 1969 at age 32.
He has been re-elected to that seat nine times. Mori was named to
his first cabinet post as education minister in 1983, followed by
an appointment as trade minister in 1992. When Obuchi became prime
minister in 1998, Mori assumed the party's second-ranking job. Mori
and his wife, Chieko, have a daughter and son.
</P>
<P>
   Junzo Nishino, who played rugby with Mori when the two were in
high school, dismissed criticism that his former teammate lacked
the leadership skills for the prime ministership.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a very considerate and compassionate man,'' Nishino said.
``Whenever we wanted to exclude some boys from the game, Mori-san
would always say, `No, let's give him a chance to train harder and
improve his ability.'''

LAWYER WORKS TO ARRANGE MIAMI VISIT BY CUBAN BOY'S FATHER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and i coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD CHACON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAVANA _ As talks between federal officials and lawyers
representing the Miami relatives of Elian Gonzalez were put on hold
until Thursday, the US lawyer representing the boy's father spent
the day in Cuba scrambling to arrange Juan Miguel Gonzalez's
immediate visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The father's lawyer, Gregory Craig, spent most of Wednesday in
Havana before flying back to Washington Wednesday night.
Accompanied by members of the US Council of Churches and
representatives from the Methodist Church, he reportedly met with
Juan Gonzalez and top members of the Cuban government in hopes of
persuading the father to travel to the US as soon as &UR;  &LR; possible to
reunite with his 6-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
   But there appeared to be two main sticking points in the
discussions: when Gonzalez would travel to Washington, and who
would accompany him.
</P>
<P>
   The US Interests Section in Havana handed over six visas on
Tuesday for Gonzalez, his wife, another son, a young cousin,
Elian's kindergarten teacher and a pediatrician. But Gonzalez, 31,
and the Cuban government have requested visas for a 28-member
delegation, including several of Elian's classmates and Ricardo
Alarcon, president of Cuba's National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez has said that he would be willing to come with a
smaller group, or even by himself, if he could take Elian back to
Cuba immediately. But he wants the larger group to be with him if
he has to stay in the US while Elian's case is decided by a federal
appeals court in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   As of Wednesday, no additional visas had been approved, a
Havana-based US official said, adding that there had been no formal
contact with Craig during his visit.
</P>
<P>
   Craig left Havana for Washington late in the afternoon without
issuing any statement about his talks. And there was no official
word Wednesday from the Cuban government.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the secrecy of Wednesday's negotiations, the drama
surrounding the young boy, who survived a shipwreck off the Florida
coast last November, continued to galvanize the residents of this
Caribbean country of 12 million people. Dozens of billboards around
Havana depict a larger-than-life painting of the boy with the
words, ``Return our Elian to us.''
</P>
<P>
   State-run Cuban television and the official newspaper, Granma,
argue that Elian has been ``kidnapped'' by anti-Castro Cuban
Americans in Miami, a group often referred to here as ``la mafia.''
</P>
<P>
   At the closing ceremony of a convention for Latin American
college students, held at the Karl Marx Theater, Cuban President
Fidel Castro joined in the ovations as a litany of student speakers
denounced the Cuban-American community protecting Elian and
demanded the boy's immediate return to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are lying to everyone, to the public, to us and to
Elian,'' said one student from the eastern Cuban city of Santiago,
referring to Elian's Miami relatives. ``It's time to stop the lies
and let our Elian come home where he belongs.''
</P>
<P>
   A few miles away, at a triangle in front of the US diplomatic
mission in Havana along the Malecon, the city's famous shoreline
drive, where Cubans have regularly held protests for Elian's
return, government workers put finishing touches on the new Plaza
de la Dignidad, a football-field-length outdoor stage with
state-of-the-art spotlights and hundreds of new, black chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a coincidence that this was built here, in front of
the office where the Americans work,'' said Rodolfo Santos, 27,
lives just a few blocks from the new stage. ``It was built because
of Elian and it's a symbol of how serious we are about getting him
back.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, the $2 million spent to build the stage could
have been used for something else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not more food or better houses?'' asked one man who walked
along the stage and refused to give his name. ``That would be a
better example why we believe Elian would be better off here than
in Miami.''

LABOR SECRETARY CLEARED IN FUND-RAISING PROBE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Labor Secretary Alexis Herman was cleared Wednesday
of any wrongdoing by an independent counsel who spent 23 months
investigating allegations that she was involved in illegal
fund-raising and influence-peddling while working at the White
House.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement by Independent Counsel Ralph Lancaster that
Herman faces no criminal charges also signals that his inquiry will
end. Charges were filed against only one person, a Singapore
businessman accused of illegally donating $200,000 to the
Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Herman is the third Clinton Cabinet member cleared of wrongdoing
after lengthy, multi-million dollar investigations by a variety of
independent counsels. One other _ former Housing Secretary Henry
Cisneros _ pleaded guilty to perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster investigated allegations that Herman solicited the
illegal campaign contributions through two friends and engaged in a
kickback scheme when she was a White House aide during President
Clinton's first term in office.
</P>
<P>
   The two friends, Vanessa and Caryliss Weaver, have been notified
by Lancaster's office that they would not be prosecuted, their
attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he was pleased by Lancaster's decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I said at the start of this inquiry nearly two years ago,
Secretary Herman did nothing wrong,'' the president said. ``She did
not deserve what she has had to endure over the past many months.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the Herman investigation, the president _ who was
impeached in a separate, 5{-year, $52 million inquiry that has yet
to end _ was interviewed under oath by Lancaster and two of his
deputies in September 1999.
</P>
<P>
   After Lancaster announced that he would seek no indictment
against her, Herman said she was ``gratified personally and for my
family that the independent counsel has terminated his
investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Her attorney, W. Neil Eggleston, said he was pleased.
``Secretary Herman cooperated with (the independent counsel) in
every way possible, and we always believed that he would conclude
that she had engaged in no wrongdoing,'' Eggleston said.
</P>
<P>
   Lancaster's investigation of Herman centered on allegations by
Cameroon-born businessman Laurent Yene that he delivered an
envelope of cash to Herman's home. The money, Yene said, was
Herman's share, or 10 percent, of a consulting fee he earned from a
Singapore businessman, Abdul Rahman, while seeking a federal
license for a satellite telephone system.
</P>
<P>
   Yene said Herman earned her share by using her influence to aid
clients of a consulting business he partly owned with Vanessa
Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver had purchased the company from Herman in 1993 when Herman
took a job running the White House Office of Public Liaison. Yene
subsequently joined the consulting business as co-owner.
</P>
<P>
   Yene and Vanessa Weaver worked with Rahman to obtain a license
from the Federal Communication Commission, eventually awarded in
1997. Yene and Weaver ended their business relationship in the
mid-1990s, and Rahman hired another Weaver firm in Sept. 1996. A
month later, according to federal records, she and her sister
Caryliss gave $150,000 to the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Yene accused Herman of soliciting the money from Rahman, who
could not legally make political contributions as a non-U.S.
citizen. Rahman was introduced to Herman by Vanessa Weaver on one
or two occasions and to Clinton during his 1996 re-election
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 16, Rahman was indicted by a federal grand jury on
charges of making $200,000 in illegal contributions to the
Democratic National Committee and four state party organizations in
1996. As a foreigner, Rahman is barred from making donations to
political candidates or political parties. The indictment said
Rahman made 11 donations under the Weaver sisters's names.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecution of Rahman is considered unlikely unless he returns
to the United States and is arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation was begun in May 1998 when Attorney General
Janet Reno, against the advice of her staff, decided that financial
records ``might possibly'' support Yene's allegations and an
independent examination was needed. A five-month inquiry by the
Justice Department had found no evidence that Herman had committed
a crime.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Lancaster, a lawyer from Portland, Maine, was the last special
prosecutor appointed under a now-defunct law that required
government-funded, independent investigations of credible
allegations of wrongdoing by top-ranking administration officials.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five investigations of Clinton's Cabinet members, only
one resulted in a conviction. Former Housing Secretary Henry
Cisneros pleaded guilty Sept. 7, 1999, to lying under oath to the
FBI about secret payments to his former mistress. Cisneros, who was
the target of a four-year, $12 million independent counsel probe,
was ordered to pay a $10,000 fine.
</P>
<P>
   An 18-month, $5.6 million investigation of Interior Secretary
Bruce Babbitt ended with no indictments. An effort to begin an
investigation into Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown ended when he
died in an airplane crash four years ago. Former Agriculture
Secretary Mike Espy was tried and acquitted on corruption charges
after a four-year, $22 million investigation.

2D MAN CHARGED IN ALLEGED CANCER DRUG SCAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ US Attorney Donald K. Stern has charged a second man in
what authorities say was a scam involving a phony cancer drug made
in an unlicensed facility in suburban Woburn in the mid-1990s, and
shipped to doctors and patients across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The defendant, Thomas M. Rodgers Jr., 56, of Atlanta, was
charged Wednesday with three violations of the Food, Drug and
Cosmetic Act in a report filed by the US Attorney and the federal
Food and Drug Administration's Office of Criminal Investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers appears to be the man referred to as ``Mr. X'' in an
indictment filed in January charging a Cape Cod man with fraud in
connection with the same purported cancer drug. Thomas Ronald
Theodore, 54, of Sandwich was charged with defrauding investors in
Private Biologicals Corp., the Woburn company named Wednesday in
the court document referring to Rodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Theodore was posing as a doctor as he
solicited investments in Private Biologicals. Theodore was
convicted of mail fraud in 1987, after being charged with falsely
claiming he had graduated from a medical ``diploma mill'' in the
Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   At the center of the alleged scheme are the drug _
Lymphokine-200, or LK-200 _ and the manufacturing company, which
authorities say was turning out the drug in the Woburn plant from
1993 to 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Rodgers was chairman of the board of directors and a majority
shareholder of Private Biologicals Corp., according to the court
document. During that time, according to the earlier indictment,
Theodore and ``Mr. X'' falsely told investors that they had
discovered or developed LK-200 and that they intended to patent the
drug. Through this and other alleged misrepresentations, the
indictment says, the pair raised some $2 million from investors and
received payments for consulting services.
</P>
<P>
   FDA officials allege that the Woburn facility was never licensed
to produce drugs and that LK-200, which was not approved for sale
by the FDA, was illegally shipped in interstate commerce. In
addition, the charges say that the drug was stored under unsanitary
conditions and was not manufactured with good manufacturing
practices.
</P>
<P>
   The documents say that the two defendants created a ``charade''
that LK-200 was being made legally outside the United States and
was shipped from the Bahamas to customers.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the indictment against Theodore says, the defendants
arranged to have the drug shipped from Woburn to the Bahamas and
from the Bahamas to pharmacists, physicians, and patients around
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Although the charges against Rodgers do not make the connection,
LK-200 is the name of a drug that figures in the decades-long saga
of Dr. Stanislaw Burzynski, a physician who has operated a clinic
in Houston since 1977, where he treats patients with what he calls
``anti-neoplastons.'' These substances, extracted from urine and
processed into a drug, are manufactured under the LK-200 name.
</P>
<P>
   Burzynski says the drug has cured some cancers, but many
mainstream specialists are skeptical. The National Cancer Institute
scrutinized some of his cases and agreed, along with Burzynski, to
perform clinical tests. That agreement fell apart in a disagreement
over procedures.

DOCTORS BRACE FOR QUESTIONS ON HORMONE REPLACEMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  By GINA KOLATA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Every time that Marion Nestle sees a new doctor, the awkward
question comes up. The doctor looks at her age: 63. The doctor
looks at her family history: heart disease. And the doctor asks her
why on earth is she not taking estrogen?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every encounter with a new doctor involves a discussion about
it, not raised by me, raised by the doctor,'' said Nestle, who is a
professor and chairwoman of the department of nutrition and food
studies at New York University. ``Are you taking it? Have you
considered taking it? At your age, you should be taking it.''
</P>
<P>
   Her experience is common, women say. As soon as women approach
menopause, their doctors often start asking when they will start
taking hormone replacement therapy. If the woman hesitates, her
doctor will often explain that the hormones can protect her against
heart disease, the leading killer of women.
</P>
<P>
   But now, a huge federal study of hormone replacement therapy is
calling that idea into question and doctors and individual women
are trying to deal with the consequences. Phones rang in doctors'
offices throughout the country Wednesday, and doctors braced
themselves for the inevitable questions that would come up in every
office visit with a postmenopausal woman.
</P>
<P>
   Women taking estrogen wondered if they had done the right thing.
Others who had refused the drug felt vindicated. But the real
answer, for now, is that the estrogen question is still a work in
progress.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being a medical certainty that hormone replacement
therapy protects against heart disease, preliminary data suggest,
in fact, that the drugs might cause a slight increase in heart
attacks and strokes, at least in the first two years that women
take them. The results are sketchy, and the risk, if any, seems
very slight.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Claude Lenfant, director of the National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute, which is running the study, said women taking the
therapy should not stop because of it.
</P>
<P>
   But the finding brings to the fore one of the great conundrums
of American medicine: a leading reason for using the best-selling
drug in America has never been established and might well not be
true.
</P>
<P>
   The belief that estrogen protects the heart did not come out of
nowhere. Studies comparing heart attack rates in women taking
hormone replacement therapy to those who did not found lower rates
of heart disease in women taking the hormones. The difficulty,
though, is that women who take hormones tend to have a lower risk
of heart disease anyway. They are unlikely to smoke, and more
likely to exercise and eat healthful diets.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the findings seemed to offer a solid reason for healthy
women to take a drug for the rest of their lives. For some, though,
the real appeal of estrogen might have been their hopes that it was
a path to eternal youth.
</P>
<P>
   Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the maker of Premarin, the
best-selling estrogen product, says that while 10 million American
women take the drug, it is only approved for the treatment of
symptoms of menopause, like hot flashes, and for the prevention and
management of osteoporosis, the bone disease many women suffer
after menopause. But Lauren Hutton, a supermodel who is featured in
company advertisements about menopause, told Parade magazine that
estrogen was ``good for your moods, it's good for your skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had to choose between all my creams and makeup for
looking and feeling good,'' Hutton advised, ``I'd take the
estrogen.''
</P>
<P>
   Audrey Ashby, a spokeswoman for Wyeth Ayerst, said: ``Lauren
Hutton speaks her mind about what she believes in. But she is a
spokesperson, not for Premarin, but for an unbranded ad that
discusses the consequences of menopause and estrogen loss.''
</P>
<P>
   Some women who refuse to take the drug say they constantly have
to explain themselves. ``Everyone I know takes it, practically
without exception,'' Nestle said. She does not, she says, because,
``I read the medical literature and I prefer to be cautious.''
</P>
<P>
   Now Nestle feels vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   The disconcerting finding on heart disease arose in a study,
known as the Hormone Replacement Therapy Trial of the Women's
Health Initiative, that involves about 25,000 healthy
postmenopausal women. They were randomly assigned to take hormone
replacement therapy or a dummy medication.
</P>
<P>
   Last Friday, the study investigators sent each of the women a
letter, gingerly informing them that those who took estrogen were
having slightly more heart attacks, strokes and blood clots in
their legs and lungs than those taking the placebo. The total
number of women who experienced these serious problems was very
small, less than 1 percent of the women. The effect seemed to fade
with time. But, the study investigators said, they had to tell the
women about it.
</P>
<P>
   Another recent study, of women who already had heart disease,
also found that hormone replacement therapy increased the
likelihood of heart attacks and strokes for the first two years.
Although the trend reversed itself in that study, the net effect of
estrogen was neither to protect nor harm the heart.
</P>
<P>
   Many gynecologists were persuaded by the weaker comparative
studies, however.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Nanette Wenger, a cardiologist at Emory University in
Atlanta, said she went to a medical meeting recently and tried to
explain the questions about hormone replacement therapy and heart
disease to an audience of about 700 obstetricians and
gynecologists. They were surprised, she said, telling her that they
had thought that it was well known that estrogen prevented heart
disease. As a result, Wenger said, ``often coronary disease is
cited as the reason to prefer estrogen over other therapies.''
</P>
<P>
   Some gynecologists say they will continue, for the time being,
to recommend that some women take estrogen to protect against heart
disease.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Wulf H. Utian, an obstetrician/gynecologist in Cleveland who
is the executive director of the North American Menopause Society,
said he had and still would use estrogen for that purpose. The new
findings, he said, ``don't change my stance at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charles B. Hammond, a professor and chairman of the
department of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke University, said
``it's way too soon to react'' to the Women's Health Initiative
study.
</P>
<P>
   Hormone replacement therapy ``is one tool in the war on
cardiovascular disease and a very important one,'' he said,
cautioning that at this point ``we have to be very careful not to
stampede women based on scanty information.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CAN END HERE.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some women say their doctors tried to stampede them the
other way _ into taking the hormones.
</P>
<P>
   ``My experience was plain and simple,'' said Alice Wolfson, a
55-year-old lawyer in San Francisco. Although she has no risk
factors for heart disease, she said, her doctor urged her to take
the therapy to protect her heart. ``My doctor said, `You should be
taking hormone replacement therapy,''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   Sarah Grindel, 59, who runs a quilting business with her
daughter in Rockport, Mass., saw three doctors, all of whom
insisted that she should take estrogen to protect against heart
disease, even though her blood pressure is low, her cholesterol
level is fine and she has no family history of heart disease.
``Every doctor was saying just do it, do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wenger, a principal investigator in the Women's Health
Initiative Study, said Wednesday that her office had been inundated
with calls from other doctors with questions. ``Should I let my
wife take estrogen? Should my wife continue with estrogen?'' she
said
</P>
<P>
   ``The answer is that right now, we don't know,'' Wenger said.
</P>
<P>
   That is why the National Institutes of Health is doing its
study.

<P>
   The rough stone emerges from the African soil at fortress-like
mines in the war zones of Angola or straight from the muck of a
dammed-up river in Congo. After journeying across continents and
oceans, after being graded, cut, polished and set in gold along the
way, a diamond lands in a display window in New York, transformed
into a pricey symbol of eternal love and beckoning to brides-to-be.
</P>
<P>
   The journey can take months or even years. To enforce the myth
that diamonds are rare and valuable, most of the world's rough
stones are hoarded in London and then carefully fed back into the
world market.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers, the South African conglomerate that controls
two-thirds of the world's rough diamonds, decides how many will be
sold, when, to whom and at what price.
</P>
<P>
   Where they are mined responsibly, as in Botswana, South Africa
or Namibia, diamonds can contribute to development and stability.
But where governments are corrupt, rebels are pitiless and borders
are porous, as in Angola, Congo or Sierra Leone, the glittering
stones have become agents of slave labor, murder, dismemberment,
mass homelessness and wholesale economic collapse.
</P>
<P>
   While market manipulation guarantees their price in world
markets, the portability and anonymity of diamonds _ millions of
dollars worth can be smuggled in a sock, and identifying where they
came out of the ground is often impossible _ have made them the
currency of choice for predators with guns in modern Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't wage war without money, and diamonds are money,''
said Willy Kingombe Idi, who buys diamonds from diggers in Congo.
``People are fighting for money. Everything that happens, it's
about money.''
</P>
<P>
   De Beers estimates that only 3 percent of global rough diamonds
now come from conflict areas in Africa, according to Andrew Lamont,
a company spokesman who repeatedly said it was difficult to define
a conflict area.
</P>
<P>
   But Christine Gordon, a London-based journalist and independent
diamond analyst who has been critical of De Beers, said that as
recently as the mid-1990s, diamonds from African war zones
accounted for 10 to 15 percent of the world supply.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, violent goings-on in diamond-rich Africa have done
nothing, thus far, to change the consuming habits of Americans, who
buy more than half the world's diamond jewelry. Sales jumped about
11 percent last year. Diamond sales are also booming around the
world, with De Beers showing record sales last year of more than $5
billion.
</P>
<P>
   THE WORKERS: Digging in the Mud &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At the bottom rung of the international diamond trade, the need
to scrape together enough money to eat sends Africans like Mati
Balemo clawing through the mud of a Congolese streambed. Balemo is
a digger.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, he and six other diggers set off from
Kisangani, in north-central Congo, traveling first by bicycle taxi
and then on foot. Along the way, a soldier armed with a stubby
machine gun demanded to come along. He hired another bicycle taxi,
which took a spill on a hill, pleasing the diggers.
</P>
<P>
   They arrived after three hours at a small stream where the thick
canopy of bamboo and vines made the early afternoon as dark as
twilight. The diggers had been working this site for a month and
had found only a few diamonds. They used shovels to dam off small
sections of the stream. Then they heaped mounds of mud onto the
bank. They picked out big rocks from the mud and sifted through
what was left with metal screens nailed to wooden frames.
</P>
<P>
   Diggers like Balemo are driven by the dream of one stone that
will change their lives. For weeks or months, they work bent over
in shallow rivers or in pits. In Balemo's three years as a digger,
the biggest diamond he ever found was a stone of 2.16 carats worth
$800. That diamond, if it were of flawless color and clarity, could
retail for as much as $10,000 in New York, experts say. Balemo
split his $800 among five fellow diggers.
</P>
<P>
   Miki Galedem, 30, another digger who started when he was 16
years old, once found a monstrous stone of 9 carats. He was paid
$4,800. But he was young then, in 1993, and the money disappeared,
he said, on ``beer and women.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing in a pool of water stilled by mounds of mud, the
diggers professed not to think much about their business _ where
the diamonds go, who wears them and at what price. ``Diamonds are
beautiful,'' Balemo said. ``Everyone wants to be beautiful. That is
normal.''
</P>
<P>
   He was knee-deep in the stream, and had been sifting mud _ a
brown stew with pebbles and quartz _ for an hour. Suddenly, he
found a diamond. He popped it in his mouth to clean it and then
showed off a shiny white stone half the size of a raisin. His
friends clapped, and one digger guessed that traders back in
Kisangani would pay $20 at most for the stone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very glad,'' Balemo said, not smiling much. This was the
first diamond in nearly a week. ``It's not much money for all that
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The soldier with the machine gun, who had been watching from the
riverbank, then came over and took the diamond. He folded it into a
scrap of paper backed with gold foil and stuffed the packet into
his chest pocket.
</P>
<P>
   By the rules of the Congo, the guy with the gun got the diamond.
Even when the stones are taken from the ground using the most
sophisticated equipment, the game is roughly the same.

ARCHDIOCESE TO WELCOME WOMEN WHO HAD ABORTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL PAULSON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Archdiocese of Boston, known for its staunch
opposition to abortion rights, next month will launch its largest
effort yet to encourage women who have had abortions to return to
the church.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is the outreach effort broader than anything previously
attempted here, but it is also the first that does not specifically
target Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will feature radio advertisements on five FM radio
stations popular among female listeners, and also may include a
newspaper advertising insert. The ads will urge women who have had
abortions to call an archdiocesan office that will refer them to
clerical or psychological counseling or other services.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, according to archdiocesan officials, is to offer
assistance to women from any religious background and to inform
Catholic women who have left the church that it wants them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is that many of the people who would
benefit from help after an abortion are not in church, because they
think that the church doesn't welcome them, or that they don't
belong there,'' said Barbara Thorp, director of the pro-life
activities office for the archdiocese. ``They're afraid to go to
church because of shame, and the only way we can reach them is
through the secular means of advertising.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church in the United States has had a 15-year
effort to reach out to women who have had abortions through a
program called Project Rachel, which has been publicized through
church bulletins and on occasion with small radio buys. But this
year the National Conference of Catholic Bishops is encouraging
dioceses to expand their efforts in the spirit of reconciliation,
which is one of the themes Pope John Paul II has declared for this
Jubilee Year in which the church is celebrating its 2,000th
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   The new campaign was conceived by the bishops conference and has
aired in Maryland, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., where it was
combined with billboards and bus and subway placards. Officials say
the number of women calling for help skyrocketed, in Washington
from eight calls per week to 150.
</P>
<P>
   The radio ads do not mention the Catholic Church, and an
estimated 50 percent of the women who responded to the ads in the
Washington area were not Catholic, officials said. Those women were
referred clergy of their own faith or with lay counselors.
</P>
<P>
   ``To us this is part and parcel of a complete and consistent
pro-life voice that says everybody's life is uniquely valuable,''
said Helen Alvare, spokeswoman for the Secretariat for Pro-Life
Activities of the bishops conference. ``Just as the church reaches
out to anyone with uniquely difficult suffering, we reach out in
this case as well.''
</P>
<P>
   The 60-second radio ads, which carry the tagline, ``Something
insides dies after an abortion,'' are composed of lines uttered by
women who have had abortions. In one spot, women speak of feeling
pressured by boyfriends or parents to have an abortion; in others,
women speak of a lack of support for the grieving they feel.
</P>
<P>
   The ads urge women to call a number for Project Rachel, which is
named after a verse in Jeremiah describing a woman mourning the
death of her children.
</P>
<P>
   The ads are being viewed with some skepticism by officials at
the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, a family planning
organization that performs abortions. The officials said they are
concerned that the church is exaggerating the number of women who
suffer long-term emotional trauma from abortion and that church
counselors may criticize women for their choices.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe that an organization which teaches that
abortion is a mortal sin is appropriate for unbiased and healthy
counseling,'' said Virginia Martin, an executive vice president of
Planned Parenthood of Metropolitan Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, Michelle Ringuette, spokeswoman for Planned
Parenthood League of Massachusetts, was less critical, saying, ``A
very small number of women experience extreme distress after the
procedure _ what we mostly see is relief.'' She added that ``if
women need this, they should be able to access it, and Project
Rachel is a valid place for people to contact if they have
emotional distress.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither the Boston nor Washington affiliates have received any
complaints from women who have been counseled through Project
Rachel, agency officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Two women who were counseled by Project Rachel, who agreed to
talk to the Globe at the request of the church program but asked
that their names not be published, spoke positively of their
experiences. Both women had attended retreats with other women who
had had abortions to talk about their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had an abortion about 17 years ago, and had pretty much
dismissed it, but whenever I went into a church I found myself
filling up with tears,'' said a 46-year-old businesswoman. ``I
needed to make peace. Project Rachel referred me to a priest, and
he so lovingly took me through the process of talking about all the
upsets I had about the church, without any recrimination or
judgment. I felt such peace coming home.''
</P>
<P>
   A 50-year-old woman who had been active in pro-life causes
before having an abortion said she had struggled for years to come
to grips with the emotional impact of the procedure before finally
calling for help.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call abortion the silent sin, because people go out and talk
about how they've had affairs or whatever, but this is not
something that you can talk about,'' she said. ``But when I finally
went in, I was made to feel so welcome that all my fears left me.''
</P>
<P>
   The Catholic Church, which considers abortion to be the taking
of a human life, places abortion among the most serious category of
transgressions, called mortal sins. Abortion is termed
intrinsically evil by the church, and until they are formally
absolved by a priest, women who have had abortions are considered
to be outside of the communion of the church, which makes them
ineligible to receive the sacrament of the Eucharist.
</P>
<P>
   When Project Rachel began in Boston in 1986, it referred women
seeking absolution to one of a select group of priests who had been
specially trained to work with women who had had abortions. This
year, in honor of the Jubilee, Boston's Cardinal Bernard Law has
permitted any priest to perform such absolution, and every priest
has been given training materials on working with such women.
</P>
<P>
   To receive absolution, a woman must attend confession, admit
sorrow for sin, and receive mercy, which is acknowledged when the
priest recites a specific prayer of absolution.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials say they do not condemn the women who call
them, do not force them to talk to clergy, and do not urge them to
rejoin the church, but instead try to convince them that God
forgives them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You never would be judgmental because they'd walk right out
the door,'' said the Rev. Jerome F. Gillespie, who has counseled
many women who have had abortions. ``They're still a very good
person who made a tremendous mistake and a misjudgment.''
</P>
<P>
   Gillespie said there is no conflict between the church's
antiabortion stance and its effort to reconcile with women who have
had abortions.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the one hand, the church has to keep doing what she
believes in: to preach against abortion, which we believe is a
great evil and sin,'' he said. ``On the other hand, we believe that
there is a God who is very merciful and compassionate, and we
believe in forgiveness. No sin we commit is greater than God's
love.''

 &HT;    Harbinger to be sold for $2.1 billion
 &HT;    By David McNaughton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Harbinger, one of Atlanta's early software companies,
will be acquired by San Diego-based Peregrine Systems in a stock
swap valued at $2.1 billion. The deal was announced after the
market closed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Harbinger looked at a number of ways to reach its target of
being a major player in the rapidly growing field of
business-to-business electronic commerce and decided the best path
was a merger with Peregrine Systems, said James M. Travers,
Harbinger's chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies complement each other, he said, with Harbinger
providing the software for business-to-business commerce over the
Internet, and Peregrine Systems with software to manage computer
systems and communications, facilities and transportation assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this was the best long-term way of creating
shareholder value,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, which has been in the works for about 60 days,
Harbinger shareholders will get three-fourths of a share of
Peregrine Systems for each share of Harbinger they own. Based on
Wednesday's close for Peregrine Systems _ $58 _ the deal values
Harbinger shares at $43.50 each. That's 80 percent above
Harbinger's close of $24.12 1/2 and well above the 52-week high of
$39.87 1/2 hit in mid-March.
</P>
<P>
   Travers said the companies expect to close the deal in the
second quarter. It is subject to regulatory and shareholder
approvals.
</P>
<P>
   Headquarters for the merged companies will remain in San Diego,
but Travers expects a ``significant management presence'' to remain
in Atlanta and little impact on employees.
</P>
<P>
   Harbinger, with headquarters in Atlanta, has about 1,100
employees worldwide, including 350 in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Peregrine Systems has about 1,500 employees.

   ANGOLA: Financing the Arms
</P>
<P>
   In northeastern Angola, the Catoca diamond mine _ one of a half
dozen such sites in that Texas-sized country _ is an island of
modernity in a sea of civil war. Massive earthmovers gouge out the
diamond-bearing earth and feed it into a sorting plant where water,
electric vibrators and X-rays separate out about $8 million worth
of diamonds a month _ a number expected to quadruple as the mine
expands.
</P>
<P>
   The diamonds are stored in a high-security sorting room before
being flown to Europe. As technicians grade the uncut stones,
Israeli-trained security guards watch from every angle to make sure
that no one slips a rock into his pocket. The mine has satellite
television and 24-hour Internet access, but the only way in or out
is by air. To protect employees from attack, they are locked inside
the mine's gates every night by guards with automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   Until four years ago, the men with guns were rebel soldiers
working for Unita, the Angolan rebel group led by Jonas Savimbi.
Delfi Rui, a 39-year-old digger, recalled seeing rebels whip an
elderly man who refused to dig. He said they threatened to shoot
workers who would not give them at least half the diamonds they
found.
</P>
<P>
   The Angolan military took Catoca from Unita in 1996, and within
two years modern mining began atop one of the planet's largest
veins of diamonds. The mine now employs 1,100 Angolans and has the
potential to anchor an economic revival in a part of the country
where there are no other industries, no money for war
reconstruction and no government services. Employment at the mine
is expected to last for at least four decades.
</P>
<P>
   But the persistence of fighting in the area means that men with
guns still find ways to milk the diamond business. A private
security force controlled by the chief of staff of the Angolan
army, Gen. Joao de Matos, protects Catoca. About 300 armed guards,
most of them former Angolan soldiers, have staked out a fortified
perimeter around the mine. They charge $500,000 a month to protect
the mine from Unita.
</P>
<P>
   Since they were driven from the mine, Unita soldiers have stayed
in the area and terrorized the local citizenry with hit-and-run
guerrilla raids. They have forced about 56,000 nearby civilians
from their homes. Most are destitute. Many have been maimed by land
mines. Without international food aid, they would starve.
</P>
<P>
   Unita's behavior led the United Nations to impose a diamond
embargo on the group in 1998, making it the only African rebel
force subjected to such action.
</P>
<P>
   For years, the United States and the apartheid government of
South Africa supported Unita as a counter to the Soviet-backed
Angolan government in Luanda. But with the end of the Cold War and
of apartheid, Unita lost its military patrons. International
isolation deepened when Savimbi lost an election in Angola 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than accept a vote that foreign observers judged free and
fair, Savimbi returned to the bush and resumed war against the
Angolan government. His fighters seized control of the Cuango River
valley, Angola's richest diamond territory, and began a major
mining operation that more than compensated for the lost Cold War
aid, and made them the richest rebels in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Diamond money paid for Unita offensives that in the 1990s
elevated Angola's civil war to a new plateau of savagery. Highland
cities like Cuito and Huambo were all but flattened by artillery
shells. More than half a million Angolans were killed. Land mines
maimed about 90,000. Fighting displaced 4 million Angolans, and
about 1 million continue to depend on foreign food aid. The U.N.
Children's Fund now ranks Angola as the worst place on earth to be
a child.
</P>
<P>
   At Andulo, Unita's headquarters in the central highlands of
Angola, Savimbi personally haggled with arms merchants and diamond
traders who flew in from Europe. He bargained using small bags of
diamonds, each of which contained several million dollars worth of
gems, according to Robert R. Fowler, the Canadian ambassador to the
United Nations and chairman of a committee that investigated
violations of the embargo against Unita.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If the price was $22 million, Savimbi would reach down for
four of those bags and two of those,'' Fowler said. ``The arms
dealers had their diamond experts and Savimbi had his and they
would inspect the diamonds to see if they really were worth $22
million. And then they haggled some more and somebody would throw
in an extra bag of diamonds and off the arms dealers flew.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Savimbi became a major player on the international arms scene.
Giant Russian-made Il-76 cargo planes made as many as 22 deliveries
a night at Andulo, said Fowler. The primary source for most of the
arms was Bulgaria, the report said, although Bulgarian officials
deny it.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations waited nearly six years before imposing an
embargo on Unita diamonds, even though there was never any doubt
what Savimbi was doing with his little bags. With an estimated $3
billion in legal diamond sales, he built Unita into a highly mobile
war machine with 35,000 well-armed troops. By the early summer of
last year, Unita seemed on the verge of toppling the government in
Angola.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels were turned back only because the government went on
a $500-million weapons-buying spree of its own, financed by Western

   CONGO: Creating a Wasteland
</P>
<P>
   There is no U.N. embargo on diamonds from Congo or Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger for looted diamonds is a major reason why six outside
states have sent soldiers into Congo, formerly Zaire. Angola,
Namibia and Zimbabwe have dispatched troops to protect the
government of President Laurent Kabila, while Burundi, Rwanda and
Uganda have sent soldiers to assist rebels seeking to overthrow
him.
</P>
<P>
   Altogether, they have succeeded in shattering much of the
economy of eastern Congo, and transforming Kisangani, the major
city of eastern Congo, into a gaudy and ghostly ruin.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The streets of Kisangani are nearly empty of cars. The textile
plant is closed and the once-thriving port on the Congo River is
quiet. Apart from spotty electricity from a hydroelectric dam,
there are hardly any public services left. Public salaries go
unpaid. Prices have soared.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The only businesses that seem alive are those buying diamonds
from diggers coming in from the dense forest that encircles
Kisangani. To catch their eye, storefronts have been dressed in
garish paint that shouts the names of diamond buyers like Mr. Cash,
Jihad the King of Diamonds and Jehovah Ire, run by one Papa Samuel,
``in connection with Jesus Christ.'' One store is painted with an
image of the Sylvester Stallone movie character Rambo, his machine
gun replaced with a shovel.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the diamond shops, it is possible to see hundreds of
thousands of dollars worth of stones. Shop owners say the diamonds
are often flown out of Congo to Rwanda or Uganda, as commanders
from those countries reward themselves for their revolutionary
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you think is the reason for this war?'' asked a
diamond buyer named Papa Ben, who plies his trade in Kisangani.
``It's only about the riches of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Only about a third of Congo's annual diamond production is being
sold through the country's official market, according to diamond
experts in Antwerp, Belgium. They say the rest is being smuggled
away for sale in bordering countries.
</P>
<P>
   By far the biggest diamond prize in the Congo is more than 1,000
miles to the southwest of Kisangani, near the city of Mbuji Mayi.
Diamond experts say Kabila has allocated a substantial percentage
of that huge diamond complex to Zimbabwe, which has dispatched
11,000 troops to prop up Kabila's wobbly regime.
</P>
<P>
   So Zimbabwe has recently become a major diamond exporter,
although it has a negligible local industry.
</P>
<P>
   With their eyes on the prize at Mbuji Mayi, large numbers of
Congolese rebels and supporting troops from Rwanda began massing
about a year ago to the north and east of the city. If they take
the diamond mines there, many military analysts believe, Zimbabwe
would lose its will to fight and Kabila's regime would probably
fall.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA LEONE: Allying With Smugglers
</P>
<P>
   In Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, the surgeons were
frantic. Scores of men, women and children, their hands partially
chopped off by machetes, had flooded the main hospital. Amputating
as quickly as they could, doctors tossed severed hands into a
communal bucket.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolutionary United Front, a rebel outfit that barters
diamonds for weapons, was trying early last year to conquer
Freetown. Chopping off limbs was their trademark strategy, as it
greatly simplified conquest in the diamond fields of eastern Sierra
Leone. When word got out that rebels were moving in, tens of
thousands of terrified people would take off. The rebels chased
half the country's population of 4.5 million out of their homes in
the 1990s. Half a million people fled the country.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One day during last year's carnage in Freetown, a diamond trader
approached a reporter at the Cape Sierra Hotel. He stuck out his
tongue and from beneath it plucked out a stone, which he offered to
sell. When no sale took place, the trader popped the diamond back
in his mouth and moved on.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Most of Sierra Leone's diamonds were _ and still are _ smuggled
into neighboring Liberia for sale, according to several human
rights groups and diamond industry experts.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the Sierra Leone rebels, Foday Sankoh, has
established a lucrative partnership with his longtime Liberian
friend, Charles Taylor, the rebel-boss-turned-president. Both had
training in Libya, both their rebellions began in the late 1980s,
and their armies have helped each other fight.
</P>
<P>
   Sankoh's access to the world's diamond bourses and to arms was
secured when Taylor was elected president of Liberia in 1997.
Sankoh and the Liberian government deny this trade.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of diplomats, international relief officials and
mining experts say there is persuasive evidence. Liberia was a
marginal exporter of diamonds until the mid-1990s. Since then it
has it exported some 31 million carats _ more than 200 years worth
of its own national capacity, according to trading records in
Antwerp.
</P>
<P>
   After Sankoh failed to take Freetown last year, he signed a
peace deal granting his rebels amnesty for war crimes. The deal,
which was brokered by the United Nations, also gave him a
government job _ chairman of the Strategic Minerals Commission,
which controls diamond mining.

GREENSPAN SAYS FED IS NOT AIMING TO FORCE DOWN STOCK PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, MARKET-TRADERS and STOCKS-MARKETPLACE) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Wall Street endured one of its most
unnerving rides, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
offered soothing words to investors Wednesday, saying as explicitly
as he ever has that the central bank's interest rate increases are
not intended to drive down stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But as he has now for months, Greenspan continued to identify
the wealth being generated by rising stock prices as the primary
cause of imbalances in the economy that could potentially lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan seemed intent on drawing a distinction between raising
or lowering interest rates based on movements in the stock market _
a strategy he said would be ineffective and perhaps inappropriate
for the Fed to attempt _ and acknowledging that Wall Street's
effects on the rest of the economy are so powerful that they have
to be taken into account in monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction was subtle if not meaningless to some analysts
and investors. In their view, Greenspan wants to have it both ways,
putting pressure on the markets without taking heat for it, and
they suggested that he did not mind sowing a bit of uncertainty to
keep the markets in check even as he reassures them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time he denies that he's targeting asset prices, he
highlights the fact that equity prices are central to monetary
policy at the moment,'' said Rory Robertson, an economist at
Macquarie Bank in New York. ``Removing equity market strength is
going to be part and parcel of removing economic imbalances,
whether or not you say that you're targeting equity prices.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a White House conference on the technology and the
economy, Greenspan was much clearer that he is sticking for now to
his strategy of raising rates in small steps until he is sure that
the economy is on an even keel. He said the Fed would not go ``far
wrong if we maintain a consistent, vigilant, noninflationary
monetary policy.''
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan peppered his speech with admiring phrases about the
ways in which information technology has reshaped the economy in
recent years, calling current conditions ``profoundly different''
and ``without precedent.'' And he said that the pickup over the
last few years in the growth rate of productivity _ potentially the
most fundamentally beneficial change of this era in economic
history _ shows no signs yet of slowing.
</P>
<P>
   But he warned that the positive developments could be put at
risk if the Fed allowed inflation to infect the economy. The risk
of that happening, he said, stemmed from the most basic of
misalignments in the economy, between demand, which is rising
sharply, and supply, which cannot keep pace.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenspan's view, growth in demand is exceeding the
corresponding increase in supply because it stems not from an
increase in the nation's capacity to produce but from the wealth
created by rising prices for stocks, homes and other assets, the
gyrations of the last few weeks on Wall Street notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise in stock prices, as well as in the capital gains on
homes, has created a marked increase in purchasing power without
providing an equivalent and immediate expansion in the supply of
goods and services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, analysts and investors have taken Greenspan to mean
that the most direct way to bring supply and demand back into
balance is to choke off the wealth effect. But Wednesday, Greenspan
moved closer to the more traditional central bank position that the
remedy is as simple and as complex as slowing the entire economy,
halting the gradual drop in unemployment and arresting the growth
in the trade deficit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The persuasive evidence that the wealth effect is contributing
to the risk of imbalances in our economy, however, does not imply
that the most straightforward way to restore balance in financial
and product markets is for monetary policy to target asset price
levels,'' Greenspan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leaving aside the deeper question of whether asset-price
targeting is an appropriate government function,'' he continued,
``there is little if any evidence that monetary policy aimed at
achieving that goal would be successful.''
</P>
<P>
   He went on to stress that the focus of monetary policy should be
the broader economy and any potential imbalances within it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Should changes in asset prices foster economic imbalances, as
they appear to have done in recent years, it is the latter we need
to address, not asset prices,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Greenspan has long given off somewhat conflicting signals about
the stock market and its influence on monetary policy _ in part
because he seems to be struggling with how the financial markets
interact with the real economy, and how central banks in turn
should react when markets move sharply up or down.
</P>
<P>
   His famous remark more than three years ago about ``irrational
exuberance'' was not a statement of fact but rather a question
about how policy-makers should recognize when asset price swings
are getting out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Greenspan is well aware of the power that the Fed has to
influence the markets, and over his nearly 13-year tenure at the
Fed has spoken at various times during closed-door meetings of his
fear that markets have entered speculative territory.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1994, as the Fed embarked on a series of interest rate
increases, Greenspan was at first worried about giving too big a
jolt to the markets but then happy to see stock and bond prices
tumble, according to recently released transcripts of Federal Open
Market Committee meetings from that year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we partially broke the back of an emerging speculation
in equities,'' Greenspan said in a telephone conference call with
members of the policy committee on Feb. 28, 1994. ``We also have
created a degree of uncertainty. If we were looking at the
emergence of speculative forces, which clearly were evident in very
early stages, then I think we had a desirable effect.''
</P>
<P>
   In his only direct comment Wednesday on valuations in the
market, Greenspan noted that securities analysts had projected that
earnings growth for technology companies would be double that for
the other companies in the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent that there is an element of prescience in these
expectations, it would reinforce the notion that technology
synergies are still expanding and that expectations of productivity
growth are still rising,'' Greenspan said. ``There are many who
argue, of course, that it is not prescience but wishful thinking.
History will judge.''

 By J. BRADFORD DELONG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Two decades ago, Ronald Reagan campaigned for
president promising to shrink the size of the federal government.
And in America's political mythology Reagan's victory started the
rollback of the social insurance state. Reagan pushed his immense
supply-side tax cut through Congress and so starved and shrank the
leviathan that was the government.
</P>
<P>
   This is the mythology. But it is not the economic history. In
the current budget year _ in fiscal 2000 _ the share of the
nation's economic output, or gross domestic product, collected by
the federal government as taxes will be more than 20 percent, up
from an average of 18.7 percent for the five administrations before
Reagan's, 1976 through 1980. How did this come to pass? What
happened to the supply-side line in the sand drawn by Reagan?
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the 1981 tax-cut shift in America's political
economy was eroded to nothing has three parts: the deficits of the
1980s, the forecasts in the early 1990s and the boom of the late
1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan's 1981 tax cut came without significant spending cuts.
1981 was the year of tax cuts. But 1982 and the years following
were the years of deficits. Even before the ink of Reagan's
signature was dry, his policymakers began loudly and angrily to
blame each other for the deficit.
</P>
<P>
   David Stockman, the budget director, and his aides blamed the
rest of the administration's unwillingness to think about serious
budget cuts. Martin Anderson, who was the White House domestic
policy adviser early in Reagan's first term, disagreed, blaming a
Congress that ``time and time again'' rebuffed presidential plans
to cut spending.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic House leaders and Republican Senate leaders
accurately pointed out that nine-tenths of the deficit would have
remained had Congress accepted every one of Reagan's spending
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most interesting attribution of blame came late, in
the mid-1990s, from Irving Kristol, the conservative intellectual,
whose magazine, The Public Interest, had helped start the
supply-side boom. Kristol contended the mistake was in carrying out
the campaign promises of 1980, for supply-side doctrine was a
political platform, not a public policy, and had a ``rather
cavalier attitude toward the budget deficit and other monetary or
fiscal problems.''
</P>
<P>
   The point, he added, was to create a ``Republican majority _ so
political effectiveness was the priority, not the accounting
deficiencies of government.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter whose finger-pointing you agree with _ Stockman's,
Anderson's, Senate Republican leader Bob Dole's or Irving Kristol's
_ the fact of the deficits of the 1980s created slow but inexorable
pressure to raise taxes to close the deficit. The process of taking
back some of the revenue given away by the government in 1981 began
as early as 1982 with a tax bill pushed through Congress largely by
Dole.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to raise taxes was amplified by another consequence
of the deficit: slower economic growth. The deficit meant reduced
money for investment, which meant lower income growth, which meant
lower revenue growth. As a result, the long-term forecasts of the
administration's Office of Management and Budget and the
Congressional Budget Office kept turning out to be substantially
more optimistic than what actually happened. So by the early 1990s,
both the OMB and the CBO, eager not to overestimate federal revenue
yet again, began _ perhaps unconsciously _ to low-ball their
forecasts. In the early 1990s, as the economy weakened and
government revenue slowed, the offices produced increasingly
pessimistic and horrifying deficit forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   This increased the pressure for tax increases. Both George Bush,
a Republican, and Bill Clinton, a Democrat, proposed tax increases
explicitly aimed at reversing the widening deficits. And by 1994-95
federal revenues as a share of GDP were as high as they had been in
Jimmy Carter's term.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the boom of the late 1990s. Lowered interest rates
driven in part by the shrinking of annual budget deficits, coupled
with the flourishing of the information technology sector _ partly
made possible by extra money no longer going to cover the
government deficit that fueled high-investment expansion _ fostered
a boom in asset prices.
</P>
<P>
   And as the paper wealth of rich Americans grew, the well-off
began to cash in some of their gains. Such increases in the stock
of wealth from higher asset prices are not part of GDP, which
measures the flow of goods and services newly produced, and has no
place for changes in value of assets that already exist.
</P>
<P>
   But the Internal Revenue Service collects extra taxes when the
affluent sell assets and realize capital gains. Thus the magnitude
of the boom in production and the value of wealth has pushed
federal revenue relative to GDP to their current level.
</P>
<P>
   In retrospect the people who worked hard in the late 1970s to
elect a president to cut federal spending and roll back the social
insurance state saw their work go for naught. They had succeeded,
or thought they did, with the election of Reagan. They were elated,
and their social democratic adversaries disheartened. But today the
level of federal taxes shows no sign of their work.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps there is a moral here. Perhaps if you are in politics to
change actual policy _ rather than to provide jobs for your friends
_ it is important to make sure that those you vote and work for do
not take political effectiveness and media splash as their sole
compass.

 This article was reported by Alan Cowell in Zambia and Belgium, Ian
Fisher in Congo, Blaine Harden in Angola and New York, Norimitsu
Onishi in Sierra Leone and Congo, and Rachel L. Swarns in
Botswana.

<P>
   Although they are linked to ongoing warfare and misery in
African countries like Congo and Angola, diamonds need not lead to
horror. Botswana, the world's largest diamond producer, is one of
the most stable and prosperous countries in Africa. The diamond
industry there employs nearly a fourth of the country's 1.5 million
people and accounts for two-thirds of government income.
</P>
<P>
   The South African diamond conglomerate De Beers and the Botswana
government control the industry in a 50-50 partnership, but there
is far more to the country's success than corporate paternalism.
First of all, the borders of Botswana _ unlike the borders of many
African countries _ make sense. Inside Botswana's borders, there is
ethnic and linguistic unity, and a long history of democratic
decision-making.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional chiefs rarely take action without first consulting
ordinary villagers, who are invited to speak freely. The fact that
Botswana gained independence peacefully has also helped. The
country was so poor that the British decided it was not worth
fighting for, so it was never inundated with guns or soldiers.
</P>
<P>
   When De Beers discovered diamonds in Botswana in 1969, the
government had been independent for three years and the men running
it were traditional chiefs who owned cattle. They came from a
desert culture where people have to scrimp and save to survive the
long, dry season.
</P>
<P>
   During three decades, Botswana's leaders have carefully guided
what became the world's fastest-growing economy. They invested in
roads, schools and clinics. In stark contrast to the rulers of
Angola and Congo, they created an African nation devoted to
improving the lives of its people. In 1965, the year before
independence, only about half of primary-school-aged children
attended school. Today, 90 percent of that group is enrolled. Life
expectancy, which was less than 50 at independence, is now near 70.
</P>
<P>
   In Botswana, phones work, potholes get repaired, garbage gets
picked up and a lively press pokes fun at the government without
fear. At $3,600 per year, the gross national product per capita is
seven times higher than the average for sub-Saharan Africa. The
standard of living is higher in Botswana than in South Africa,
Turkey or Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   ``Diamonds are not devils,'' said Terry Lynn Karl, a professor
of political science at Stanford University and the author of ``The
Paradox of Plenty,'' a book about the poisonous mix of natural
resources, big money and thieving elites in developing countries.
``What matters is that there be a tradition of good government and
compromise in place prior to the exploitation of these resources.''
</P>
<P>
   THE HISTORY: Exploiting a Continent
</P>
<P>
   The miseries of modern Africa are, in many ways, a legacy of its
history.
</P>
<P>
   In Angola and Congo, colonialism obliterated whatever political
culture may have pre-dated the arrival of Europeans. It invented
huge, largely fictive nations roping together people who regarded
each other as foreigners. To make their nation-building pay,
colonialists used force to haul off everything from ivory to rubber
to human beings.
</P>
<P>
   In Congo, the Belgian colonial state was famously greedy and
cruel. Its agents set impossible quotas for production of rubber
and ivory, killing or chopping off the hands of villagers who
failed to meet them. Novelist Joseph Conrad called it ``the vilest
scramble for loot that ever disfigured the history of human
conscience.''
</P>
<P>
   In Angola, the Portuguese were less brutal, but no less toxic.
At independence in 1975, several hundred thousand Portuguese
residents, virtually the entire educated population, abandoned the
country. Some took their doorknobs with them. They left behind a
place where almost no Angolans had any training in statecraft,
business or agriculture.
</P>
<P>
   And for most of the last half century, the Cold War and the
white-minority regimes of southern Africa injected cash and arms
into regional wars.
</P>
<P>
   The CIA, for example, supported the Angolan rebel group Unita in
the early 1970s and again in the late 1980s. Angola's Marxist
government received military assistance from the Soviet Union and
up to 50,000 troops from Cuba. When the CIA was not helping Unita,
the rebels got military backup from white-ruled South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Leone, a small country in West Africa, had a more benign
colonial history under British rule. But since the 1940s, predators
who smuggle diamonds have warped every aspect of the nation's
economic and political life.
</P>
<P>
   The meddling of colonialists, superpowers and white regimes all
but stopped at the start of the 1990s, leaving diamonds, oil and
other natural resources as the primary forage for rebels and
governments.
</P>
<P>
   In the countries where there was nothing to trade for weapons _
as in Mozambique, where post-apartheid South Africa stopped funding
rebellion and post-communist Eastern Europe stopped funding the
government _ war simply fizzled out.
</P>
<P>
   But Angola, Congo and Sierra Leone had plenty of diamonds left
over to excite greed, fuel war and to buy favors.
</P>
<P>
   A U.N. report on Unita described how its leader, Jonas Savimbi,
gave a ``passport sized'' packet of diamonds to the president of
Togo, Gnassingbe Eyedema, as payment for allowing his children to
live in Togo and go to school there. Togo has denied it.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Savimbi ``sealed'' his friendship with the president of Burkina
Faso, Blaise Compaore, by giving him a number of envelopes full of
diamonds, as well as contributing to his political campaign and
helping his government pay debts, according to the report. In
return, it said that Burkina Faso sent Savimbi three flights of
diesel fuel. The government of Burkina Faso denies it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, the diamonds, diamonds, diamonds,'' said a character in
Graham Greene's ``The Heart of the Matter,'' a 1948 novel set in
Sierra Leone. ``You cannot understand how many bribes are
necessary.''

   De Beers created its cartel 110 years ago when the company's
founder, Cecil Rhodes, realized that the sheer abundance of
diamonds in southern Africa would make them virtually worthless. By
carefully manipulating scarcity, De Beers prospered as perhaps the
most powerful cartel in the annals of modern commerce.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, however, De Beers has run afoul of U.S.
antitrust laws. The company's senior executives dare not enter the
United States because of an outstanding antitrust indictment that
charges De Beers with fixing the prices of industrial diamonds.
</P>
<P>
   The company's grip on the diamond market has slipped a bit from
near-total dominance at mid-century, but it has continued to keep
the price of gem-quality diamonds high by being both aggressive and
flexible. Through the years, De Beers has sponged up periodic
floods of diamonds from Russia, Australia and, until recently,
across parts of war-torn Africa where it does not own all the
mines.
</P>
<P>
   Together with the artificial perception of rarity, what makes
diamonds profitable to more than 2.5 million miners, traders,
cutters and wholesalers around the world _ and what energizes the
$50-billion-a-year retail diamond jewelry industry _ is romance.
</P>
<P>
   That, for the most part, is also an invention of De Beers. In
1938, De Beers hired a New York advertising firm to convince
millions of couples that the larger the diamond on an engagement
ring, the greater their love. In the 1960s, a similar campaign in
Japan created a diamond engagement ring ``tradition.''
</P>
<P>
   Diamonds spilling out of Angola's war zone have had a
destabilizing effect on the cartel, first by increasing the supply
of gem-quality stones and then by tarring the reputation of De
Beers as a company that trafficked in blood-stained goods.
</P>
<P>
   To maintain world prices, De Beers bought up a sizable amount of
what Unita was selling _ although the company insists it bought the
diamonds on the open market without any direct dealings with the
rebels, and that it stopped all buying when the embargo was imposed
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Global Witness, a London-based human rights group, embarrassed
De Beers in October 1998 with a report that showed _ citing the
company's own annual reports _ how the cartel had pumped large
amounts of money into the coffers of the rebels as the war
escalated.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, De Beers took decisive action. The company
declared last October that it would not buy any diamonds that
originate in Angola, except from one government-controlled mine.
</P>
<P>
   Some diamond analysts said De Beers' announcement, while
laudable, came late _ after Unita, having exhausted the easy
pickings in Angola's alluvial mines and having lost considerable
territory to Angolan government forces, could no longer roil the
world market with high quality stones.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers moved again in March to sanitize the image of the
diamonds it sells. As of March 26, the company says it can
guarantee that none of its diamonds originate with African rebels,
but come instead from its own mines in South Africa, Botswana or
Namibia, or are bought from mines in Russia or Australia.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups have welcomed De Beers' moves and praise the
company for taking steps they say the entire diamond industry
should follow. Rebel-mined diamonds, though, can still find their
way out of Africa. About a third of diamonds imported into the
United States are purchased from traders who are not employed by De
Beers and are not bound by its new rules.
</P>
<P>
   ANTWERP: Tracing the Stones
</P>
<P>
   Near the train station in Antwerp, Belgium, police barricades
seal off three narrow streets. In warren-like rooms above the
streets, men hunch over precision turntables, grinding rough
diamonds to coax forth shapes and colors that lure wholesaler
jewelers to Belgium from around the globe.
</P>
<P>
   Eight out of 10 of the world's rough diamonds _ about 125
million carats a year _ pass through Antwerp's Diamond Center. But
exactly which of those stones come from war zones in Africa is
something Antwerp's experts say they find hard to tell.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Vaughan, managing director of the Diamantkring, one of
the four exchanges in Antwerp, said his business depends on trust,
and that if diamonds have been smuggled by African rebels and
re-packaged elsewhere, ``We don't know about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many diamond traders in Antwerp don't particularly want to know
where the stones come from. A recent U.N. report complained of
``extremely lax regulations'' at the world's largest diamond bourse
in Antwerp. A Canadian human rights group, Partnership Africa
Canada, calls Antwerp ``a diamond smuggler's dream.''
</P>
<P>
   Belgium has objected to the report, saying it ignores major
moves in January to set up tougher customs inspections and a new
certification system with the Angolan government.
</P>
<P>
   But it is not just Belgium. According to the U.N. report,
Antwerp is flooded with diamonds exported from countries passing
off smuggled diamonds as their own, complete with false, but
official, certificates of origin. The experts say these countries
include Liberia, Uganda, Rwanda and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   One way to keep rebel-mined diamonds off the world market would
be to impose a diamond embargo on African countries known to be
exporting smuggled stones. Thus far, though, there is little
enthusiasm in the United Nations for such a move. ``It is tough
enough in Angola, believe me,'' Fowler said.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and some members of Congress are also
calling for a mandatory diamond labeling system. One proposal calls
for a worldwide ban on sales unless diamonds have verifiable
documents proving country of origin. A bill introduced in Congress
last year would require similar documentation for diamonds sold in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Hall, D-Ohio, and Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Va., introduced
the bill after seeing the horrors of war in Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world looked the other way in Angola for most of the
1990s, while revenues from diamond sales were used to butcher
innocent civilians,'' Wolf said. ``We should not stand by as the
same thing happens in Sierra Leone and Congo. We should do whatever
it takes to cut off the flow of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The diamond industry in the United States objects to the
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no way to tell where a diamond comes from,'' said Eli
Haas, president of the Diamond Dealers Club of New York. ``Diamonds
don't have identifying marks and probably never will. You just
can't look at a diamond and say, yes, it comes from Sierra Leone.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be changing. De Beers says that it is ``actively
pursuing'' a diamond fingerprinting technology being developed by
the Royal Canadian Mounted Police at a forensic laboratory in
Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
   Using lasers, the technology tries to identify chemical
impurities that are characteristic of diamonds from a particular
country. Before it can work, though, a huge database containing the
fingerprints of the world's diamonds would have to be gathered and
a method of industrial testing would have to be devised.
</P>
<P>
   ``Identifying them is going to take many years,'' said Andrew
Bone, a De Beers spokesman in London. ``Most international experts
believe that the techniques are not yet sufficient to allow the
tracing of individual stones. Nevertheless, we are committed to
helping in any way we can.''
</P>
<P>
   THE MARKET: Buying Tokens of Love
</P>
<P>
   It appears likely, then, that a trickle of diamonds from the war
zones of Africa will continue to leak into jewelry stories, at
least until technology, international law or a heretofore unseen
vigilance in the diamond industry finds a way to stop it.
</P>
<P>
   De Beers insists that the chances of buying such a diamond are
infinitesimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is less than a one-in-a-hundred chance that any single
stone will come from conflict areas,'' said Bone.
</P>
<P>
   Despite such assurances, the window remains open for African
rebels. Smugglers in Sierra Leone and Congo have ready access to
the third of the world diamond market that De Beers doesn't
control. And Unita, although its diamond dealing is down sharply
from the mid-1990s, is still selling between $80 and $150 million
worth of stones a year, according to the most conservative
estimates. To perk up sales, Unita held a sale last year, military
experts said, marking down rough diamonds prices by a third.
</P>
<P>
   The perceived need to own a diamond appears, if anything, to be
increasing.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent Sunday afternoon, Tracy Scholl, of Suffolk County,
N.Y., stood with her fiance, Mike Sabatino, at an engagement ring
counter on 47th Street in Manhattan's diamond district.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get engaged, you get a diamond,'' said Scholl as
Sabatino, an electrician from Staten Island, warily eyed a
one-carat ring that cost $5,500. ``It is what you are supposed to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   And Africa? ``I want to say that I would not want a diamond
because of that stuff in Africa, but I guess that's not really
true,'' said Scholl. ``Me not buying a diamond is not going to stop
what is going on over there.''

McCANN GETS QB CALL FOR UCLA _ FOR NOW 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Last spring, UCLA had five quarterbacks and no
starter. This spring, the Bruins, who began practice Tuesday, are
down to three quarterbacks . . . and, again, no starter.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, they have a temporary starter, sophomore Ryan McCann, and
they definitely have a third-stringer, junior Scott McEwan.
However, because of a shoulder injury to sophomore Cory Paus, who
cannot participate in contract drills this month, coach Bob Toledo
won't name an opening-day starter until training camp in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wouldn't be fair to Cory,'' Toledo said. ``He was the
starter for most of the games last year and then he got hurt. When
he comes back healthy and can compete in the fall, that's when
we'll make a decision.''
</P>
<P>
   Paus broke his left (nonthrowing) collarbone Nov. 13 against
Washington. On Jan. 18, he had surgery to tighten the capsule in
his left shoulder, a condition that's plagued him since high
school. The combination of the broken bone and the offseason
surgery prevented Paus from throwing for four months.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Paus is involved in all the meetings, film sessions and
passing drills this month, though he cannot participate in the
contact drills and scrimmages that are essential to quarterback
evaluation. He expects to be ready for training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't able to do anything when it comes to being a better
quarterback,'' Paus said after Tuesday's practice. ``But I feel
really good. I thought I'd be a lot more rusty. . . . I thought I'd
look like a high school quarterback. My accuracy was a little off,
but I didn't lose too much arm strength. I haven't thrown at a
moving target for four months.''
</P>
<P>
   McEwan will be the second-stringer during contact drills. Drew
Bennett, who started opening day last season, is a full-time
receiver.
</P>
<P>
   McCann, who completed 17 of 29 passes against USC in his only
start, did not play baseball this spring in order to focus on
football. One of the hardest workers on the team, he organized the
7-on-7 passing drills (receivers and running backs against
linebackers and defensive backs), and he spent two hours each day
studying film and the playbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see an opportunity and I'm trying to take advantage of it,''
said McCann, who is from Westlake. ``I can honestly say that now I
know what everybody does on every play. That's come from the 7-on-7
drills and studying the playbook. Now I have to apply it.''
</P>
<P>
   __ Position changes: The most noteworthy changes involve three
starters on the offensive line. Tackle Brian Polak has moved to
guard, his natural position. Guard Mike Saffer has moved to tackle,
and tackle Blake Worley has moved to guard. Polak and Saffer are
expected to start.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Santi Hall has moved to outside linebacker, where
he'll compete with Tony White for the starting job. Defensive
tackle Steve Sanchez, a redshirt freshman, has moved to center,
where he'll relieve starter Troy Danoff. Reserve linebackers Ed
Stansbury and Chris Jackson have moved to fullback, where the
Bruins must replace Durell Price. Reserve cornerback Paul Nelson
has moved to receiver, his primary position in high school.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was combination of a couple players asking for the changes
and us deciding on a couple guys,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   __ Injury update: Several players aren't available this spring,
including Polak (offseason knee surgery), Danoff (knee surgery),
reserve cornerback Joe Hunter (knee surgery) and reserve offensive
tackle Josh Webb (shoulder surgery).
</P>
<P>
   __ Roster update: Junior wide receiver Freddie Mitchell won't
participate in spring practice because he's playing baseball _ and
hitting .286 through nine games.

HEALTH GROUPS URGE USE OF COMMON ANTIBIOTIC IN FIGHT AGAINST AIDS
IN AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
  By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The 23 million Africans infected with the AIDS virus
should be given regular doses of a common and affordable
antibiotic, two international health groups said on Wednesday, as a
way to ward off fatal secondary infections.
</P>
<P>
   The World Health Organization and UNAIDS based their
recommendation on encouraging preliminary studies, and added that
if the results are borne out, the impact could be dramatic.
Virtually all of those infected with the virus will still die
prematurely of AIDS, the two groups said, but many could add years
to their lives and have longer gaps between debilitating
complications.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, known as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or as
cotrimoxazole, is marketed as a generic medicine in the United
States, treating a variety of ailments including urinary tract
infections and bronchitis; it is best known as Bactrim, a trademark
of Roche Pharmaceuticals. In Africa, ongoing use of the drug can
cost as little as $8 a year per patient. Its use as a preventive
measurein Africa was endorsed for the first time last week by AIDS
experts who convened in Zimbabwe to assess the studies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is spending more than $100 million to
fight AIDS in Africa and is trying to raise that to $325 million.
It may spend millions of those dollars to help distribute Bactrim
in Africa, but has not yet calculated how much to commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some of the original work on this, and we're extremely
enthusiastic about it,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the
AIDS division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
``It's cost-effective, it's ready to roll, and it may become an
important component of the program. But upfront we can't make any
cost projections yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing the drug was ``a difficult decision because the
research is not definite yet,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, executive
director of UNAIDS, a joint program under the World Health
Organization that includes a number of U.N. agencies, including
UNICEF. But, Piot added, ``This drug, which is widely available and
affordable, can prolong the life of HIV-infected people and improve
their quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Bactrim has been prescribed in wealthy countries to
ward off pneumocystic carinii pneumonia, which was once a primary
killer of Americans with AIDS. In Africa, its use seems to be
appropriate in handling bacterial pneumonias, diarrheal diseases
and some septicemias, and perhaps against parasitic infections of
the brain and intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Because the studies have been brief, it is impossible to say
what the long-term effects will be, warned Dr. Badara Samb, a
medical care adviser at UNAIDS. But a one-year study in the Ivory
Coast found that Bactrim cut death rates by 50 percent among the
group that took it, he said, and a second study in the same country
found that it cut the number of dangerous complications like bouts
of diarrhea or pneumonia by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know what will happen in five years, but we can't
wait for five years to find out,'' Samb said. ``Gaining even six
months of life is not negligible _ and six months when people are
not in bed, sick, all adds to the quality of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies in South Africa and Malawi were also
optimistic that the drug was effective and could be safely given to
HIV-infected Africans, who normally have more meager diets than
Americans, have less access to clean water and do more physical
labor, and are subject to more parasitic disease.
</P>
<P>
   There are 23 million people infected with HIV in Africa, and the
rate of new infections is estimated to be 100 times that of the
United States. In some countries, as many as 25 percent of all
adults are infected, and in Botswana, the country with the highest
rate, AIDS has slashed life expectancy from nearly 70 years to 41,
according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny number of Africans can afford the $15,000 annual
cost of the ``cocktails'' of drugs that can prevent the infection
from progressing to full AIDS. Many African countries have national
annual medical budgets of as little as $6 per citizen. No public
health system and almost no employers pay for protease inhibitors
or other expensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many Africans who develop AIDS die rapidly of common
complications such as tuberculosis or malaria. Both diseases are
usually treatable with relatively inexpensive drugs, though many
Africans may be unable to reach urban hospitals that could provide
these medicines, and in very poor countries, even urban hospitals
may lack them.
</P>
<P>
   Others fall prey to parasitic diseases endemic in parts of the
continent. Bactrim seems to be able to ward off or slow down many
of these diseases.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS and WHO acknowledged that the more the drug is used, the
more danger there is of creating germs resistant to it. But the
benefits were judged to outweigh that risk.
</P>
<P>
   Although India, Bangladesh, Thailand and other Asian countries
have an AIDS epidemic rivaling Africa's, WHO and UNAIDS did not yet
recommend the preventive use of Bactrim there, awaiting more
studies, a UNAIDS spokeswoman said.

DRUG PRICE ISSUE CATCHING FIRE IN SENATE
</HEADLINE>
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Republican senator said Wednesday that he was
drafting legislation to reduce price disparities that force
consumers to pay much more for prescription drugs in the United
States than in Canada or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The senator, Slade Gorton of Washington state, who is running
for re-election, said that drug companies had become ``the new
health care villains,'' and that consumers were being ``ripped
off'' by their pricing practices.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's comments, echoing concerns expressed repeatedly by
President Clinton and other Democrats in the last two years,
suggested that the two parties might be able to find common ground
on the issue this year. The comments alarmed drug companies, which
adamantly oppose government restrictions on their prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton's remarks _ and a vote in the Senate Wednesday on a
related question _ were the clearest signs to date that some
Republicans had begun to focus on drug prices as a potent political
issue. The Senate vote came on a Democratic proposal that would
have forced lawmakers to create new Medicare drug benefits before
they could cut taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was 51-49 in favor of the proposal. But the proposal
failed because 60 votes were needed. Although Gorton voted no, six
other Republicans, including four facing the voters this year,
joined all 45 Democrats in supporting the measure.
</P>
<P>
   A drug company lobbyist said the industry's main trade
association, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, was ``in a panic'' because of Gorton's initiative. In an
interview, Gorton said the drug companies were so distressed ``they
have gone into orbit.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has not yet introduced his bill, but drug companies are
frantically trying to dissuade other senators from signing up as
co-sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said he met last week with the president of the drug
manufacturers organization, Alan F. Holmer, and with
representatives from most of the big drug companies to find out
``why Americans pay more than people in Canada or Mexico for the
same exact drug.''
</P>
<P>
   In setting drug prices, Gorton said, drug companies discriminate
against Americans and force them to pay most of the costs of
research to discover and develop drugs sold around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Unless drug companies come up with a solution of their own,
Gorton said, he will introduce legislation this month to prohibit
drug makers from charging higher wholesale prices in the United
States than in Canada or Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech on the Senate floor and in an interview Wednesday,
Gorton, a former attorney general of Washington, said he was not
telling drug companies what prices they had to charge. Rather, he
explained, ``I am simply saying that manufacturers can no longer
discriminate against American consumers by charging Canadian and
Mexican pharmacies lower prices than they charge Americans for the
same product.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said that ``several Republican senators have committed to
supporting my idea,'' and that the majority leader, Trent Lott, has
``expressed interest.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said his constituents often went to Canada to buy cheaper
drugs. ``I was astounded to learn that for the top 10 most commonly
prescribed drugs,'' he said, ``average prices are 64 percent lower
in Canada than in Washington state. That is outrageous.''
</P>
<P>
   Another border-state Congressman, Bernard Sanders of Vermont,
has made a similar point many times. But Sanders is a Democratic
socialist. Gorton is a loyal Republican who voted with a majority
of his party on 92 percent of last year's recorded votes.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a mainstream Republican to sponsor a raw price control
bill is troubling,'' Glaxo Wellcome said in ``talking points'' sent
to Senate offices.
</P>
<P>
   In a memorandum sent to one Senate office, Elizabeth Beavin, a
lobbyist for Glaxo Wellcome, said: ``No matter what Senator Gorton
is calling this proposal, it's plain and simple a price control
bill. The result would be disastrous for American consumers, our
industry and research everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton insisted that his bill would not impose price controls.
But he said it would put pressure on Canada and Mexico to let drug
companies charge higher prices, so consumers there would eventually
``pay their fair share of research and development costs.'' Then,
he said, residents of the United States would pay lower prices.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton said Americans felt ``ripped off'' under the current
system. The victims, he said, include ``40 million Americans who
are uninsured and those seniors without drug benefits who pay
higher prices at the drugstore cash register than just about anyone
else'' in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of their pricing policies,'' Gorton said, ``the drug
companies have become the new health care villains. In my state, I
hear constantly from constituents who rail against the drug
companies for charging them hundreds of dollars more than what they
would pay in Canada.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Holmer said Canadians were getting ``a free ride,'' receiving
the benefits of research done by drug companies based in the United
States without bearing an appropriate share of the costs. Holmer,
an international trade lawyer, said the United States should use
its leverage in trade negotiations to challenge this practice.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate is considering a budget blueprint that could set
aside up to $40 billion for Medicare drug benefits over the next
five years. Democrats wanted to add language saying the Senate
could not take up tax-cutting legislation unless Congress had first
approved such drug coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Among the Republicans who supported the Democratic proposal are
four senators who face the voters this fall: Spencer Abraham of
Michigan, Conrad Burns of Montana, Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island
and Mike DeWine of Ohio.
</P>

ABERCROMBIE BIG HIT IN MATADORS' CAMP
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A leaner, quicker Cos Abercrombie is the hit of
the Cal State Northridge football team's spring camp. Especially
since he's making so many.
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie is making a strong transition from middle to outside
linebacker. He's lost eight pounds since last season _ ``a lot of
stomach weight,'' he said _ and he now carries 220 pounds on his
6-foot-1 frame.
</P>
<P>
   And despite having the flu, Abercrombie was one of the quickest
defenders in a team scrimmage on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think (Abercrombie)'s playing to (our) expectations,'' said
CSUN linebackers coach Terrance Johnson. ``He's dedicated the
offseason to getting in shape. He's dedicated himself in the weight
room.''
</P>
<P>
   Abercrombie said he was not happy with the way he played last
year. He was fifth on the team in tackles, with 51, but as soon as
the season ended, he made lifestyle changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, I didn't play to my full potential,'' said
Abercrombie, who will be a junior. ``My mind wasn't there. I
changed my whole attitude. I went on a diet. I stopped eating fast
food. . . . I played a lot of basketball over the winter, which
helped with my footwork.''
</P>
<P>
   The CSUN coaches hope Abercrombie's commitment is similar to
that of Brennen Swanson, a two-time All-Big Sky first-team
selection. Swanson, a pass-rushing linebacker, became the team's
defensive MVP as a junior.
</P>
<P>
   __ Immediate help: The football program signed 15 high school
recruits in 1999 but has only signed nine this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kearin said the decrease is a direct effect of the school's
decision to jump from the Big Sky Conference to the Big West _
which forces the Division I-AA football team to go independent in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Big Sky gets an automatic bid to the Division
I-AA playoffs, but independents are forced to compete for at-large
spots. Kearin said the Matadors needed good, experienced players
rather than relying on incoming freshmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to win now,'' Kearin said. ``We had huge holes to
fill on the offensive and defensive lines. We needed some good
players, right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Midsemester transfers Ramsey Venner (Fresno State), Jason
Nicastro (Chaffey College) and Andrew Holt (Idaho) are all in
spring camp. Venner and Nicastro are defensive linemen and Holt is
an offensive lineman.
</P>
<P>
   __ New coach: Junior Thurman is the Matadors' new
defensive-backs coach, replacing Brent Huff. Thurman's most recent
experience was in the Canadian Football League as a guest coach
with the Calgary Stampeders.
</P>
<P>
   Thurman, 35, played at USC from 1984-86, and CSUN defensive
coordinator Foster Andersen was his position coach.

MARKETS RELATIVELY CALM AS DOW ENDS LOWER AND NASDAQ UP SLIGHTLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also STOCKS-MARKETPLACE, MARKET-TRADERS, MARKET-GREENSPAN) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stock prices bounced around again Wednesday, but the
markets calmed considerably from Tuesday's steep, violent swings
and record volume, conditions that at times verged on the
disorderly.
</P>
<P>
   Major gauges ended mixed as activity subsided, with many
investors stepping back to assess damage and to await earnings
reports for the first quarter and the government's survey of the
job market in March, due Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had such turbulence that some investors are simply
exhausted,'' said Hugh Johnson, investment strategist at First
Albany Corp. Tuesday's relentless selling, mostly by institutions,
followed by bargain-hunting that erased most of the losses, gave
way to a to-and-fro market of lesser, but still substantial,
swings.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite, for example, pulled out of an early 3.4
percent decline and boasted a 3.3 percent gain by mid-afternoon,
only to slip back and finish with a modest advance of 20.33 points,
or 0.49 percent, at 4,169.22. It was just the second advance in the
last eight trading days.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average, which was ahead in early
trading, finished 130.92 points, or 1.17 percent, lower, at
11,033.92. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 7.36 points,
to 1,487.37.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike many recent sessions, when stocks seemed to gyrate with
every political or expert whisper, the market largely ignored the
appearance, at a White House conference, of two of the chief
influences of recent years: Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve
chairman, and Abby Joseph Cohen, the strategist at Goldman Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan said once again that monetary policy is not aimed at
lowering stock prices and Cohen said she remained bullish.
</P>
<P>
   But biotech companies benefited from President Clinton's
statement that they should be able to patent privately financed
gene discoveries. A joint declaration on that subject with British
Prime Minister Tony Blair, either misworded or misinterpreted, was
a big factor in starting Nasdaq's spring swoon, which has chopped
17.4 points off the Nasdaq index since its March 10 peak, a loss
that was almost 28 percent at its low point Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's action was a combination of bargain hunting,
covering of short positions and cashing in of profits, said Ken
Sheinberg, head of listed trading at S.G. Cowen, adding that
traders tended to avoid big exposure when news with such
market-moving potential as the monthly labor market report is
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   Bond prices were steady as Greenspan's comments assured the
market that the Fed would maintain its policy of raising interest
rates to prevent inflation. The price of the Treasury's benchmark
30-year bond fell 5/32, to 106 22/32, while the yield, which moves
in the opposite direction from price, was 5.78 percent, up from
5.77 percent Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest drag on the Dow, 24 of whose 30 components declined,
was Coke, which stumbled 4}, to 47|, after saying that global case
sales will trail estimates. It was followed by Intel, Exxon Mobil,
American Express, Microsoft and United Technologies, all down
between two and three points.
</P>
<P>
   Sears, Roebuck, dropped from the Dow last year, was a standout
gainer, soaring 7 to 37{, the biggest rise in at least 20 years,
after announcing it expects to beat Wall Street's profit estimates
for the first quarter and full year.
</P>
<P>
   In technology, investors gravitated toward such long-established
companies as Motorola, up 12], to 148, and Texas Instruments, up
4\, to 150, partly at the expense of some recent Internet
favorites. Microsoft, in the wake of an adverse, but not
unexpected, antitrust decision on Monday, fell 2 3/16 to 86], down
from a peak of 113 on Dec. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Over-all, strategists said that while the market might move
sideways for awhile, it will likely rise again when earnings
reports prove even better than expected.
</P>
<P>
   When the current ``information void'' ends, said Thomas M.
Galvin, chief investment officer at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette,
``I think fundamentals will overwhelm nervous psychology.''
</P>
<P>
   After the close Yahoo reported strong earnings that beat
published Wall Street estimates but that fell a bit short of
so-called whisper predictions. The shares, which at 4 p.m. were
down 1 13/16 to 165 9/16, traded as low as 159 in after-hours
trading.
</P>
<P>
   In first public offerings, Metlife advanced 1\, to 15{ and was
the session's most actively traded issue with 65.6 million shares
changing hands. Shares of Krispy Kreme, the doughnut company,
jumped 16 to close at 37.
</P>
<P>
   Overseas, stocks fell broadly in most major markets _ 3.4
percent in Hong Kong, 3 percent in Paris, 2.5 percent in Frankfurt,
0.7 percent in London and 0.6 percent in Tokyo.

HOUSE AGAIN PASSES BAN ON `PARTIAL-BIRTH' ABORTIONS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The House approved a ban on so-called
``partial-birth'' abortions Wednesday for the third time in five
years, but the measure is certain to be vetoed by President Clinton
if it passes the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has vetoed similar measures twice before, and Congress
has failed to override his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Republican supporters of the measure acknowledged that a like
fate may await the bill this year, but they pressed ahead in an
effort to fulfill a political promise to social conservatives in
the party to promote the passage of ``family-oriented''
legislation.
</P>
<P>
   The ban on such abortions was approved by a House vote of 287 to
141, with 77 Democrats joining 209 Republicans for passage.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the measure complained that the ban would provide no
exception for the health of the mother, even though it does contain
a provision that would allow the procedure to be used only to save
the life of the mother.
</P>
<P>
   White House officials said that language was not broad enough to
address other health concerns short of death and insisted that the
bill would infringe on the right of a woman, in consultation with
her doctor, to decide whether the procedure was necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Although the issue has been debated in Congress seven times
since 1995, the arguments that unfolded on the floor were highly
emotional and politically-charged. Republican advocates of the ban
used graphic illustrations to make their point that the procedure,
performed during the second or third trimester of pregnancy,
constitutes a murderous and immoral act.
</P>
<P>
   House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, described how the
procedure involves partially delivering the fetus and then piercing
its skull with an instrument to abort it.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can't see the abject cruelty of this procedure, then I
feel for you,'' Armey told his colleagues, calling it a ``cruel and
ugly'' way to end a baby's life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most Americans wouldn't want this process done to a dog,''
added House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, calling the procedure
``a stain'' on our nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   He called on Clinton ``to listen to the conscience of America
and sign this ban.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents of the measure, however, accused Republicans of trying
to turn it into an election year issue while ignoring state court
rulings that say banning the procedure would be unconstitutional
because it would infringe on a woman's right to choose abortion as
guaranteed under the Supreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., called the ban ``an attack on the
constitutional right to reproductive choice,'' adding that it would
``insert the government into one of the most personal and painful
decisions a woman will ever have to make.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Chet Edwards, D-Texas, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am strongly opposed to late term abortions,'' Edwards said.
But he added that such a decision ``should be made by a woman and
her doctor, not by politicians in Washington.''
</P>
<P>
   He warned his colleagues that the bill would ``do harm to
decent, loving women'' unless its language was broadened to include
exemptions for health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   ``A health exemption for women is not a loophole, it's a
constitutional right,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Ken Bentsen, D-Texas, also accused Republicans of putting
politics over policy at the expense of women's health issues. He
called on GOP lawmakers to consider a compromise bill that would
take into account the serious long-term health consequences to a
mother if she was forced to carry a questionable pregnancy to the
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in Congress are not medical specialists,'' Bentsen said.
``Most people agree that there are too many late term abortions.
But that's no reason not to make exceptions for the life and health
of the mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Bentsen noted that a number of states, including Texas, already
have laws addressing the procedure, but they make exceptions for
serious health concerns.
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders refused to allow a vote on any substitute
legislation, insisting that anything short of an exemption to save
the life of the mother would be condoning murder.
</P>
<P>
   The vote marked the seventh time the House has dealt with the
issue since Republicans took over control of Congress in 1995.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The vote came as the Supreme Court is preparing to hear
arguments later this month on the constitutionality of a ban on the
procedure enacted by the Nebraska legislature that provides no
exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   There is no connection between the Nebraska law and the federal
ban pushed by Republican leaders. But by including a narrowly
defined exemption to save the life of the mother, sponsors of the
federal ban hope to avoid a constitutional challenge if their bill
ever becomes law.
</P>
<P>
   The debates have always caused considerable anguish for
Democrats who are abortion rights supporters, but find it difficult
to oppose ending a procedure that many find repulsive.
</P>
<P>
   House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt of Missouri, for example,
voted along with 77 other Democrats and 209 Republicans for passage
of the ban. Eight of the 17 Texas Democrats in the House voted in
favor of the ban, along with all 13 of the state's Republican
members.

STUDY FINDS LITTLE ACCESS TO PAIN DRUGS IN POOR NEIGHBORHOODS 
</HEADLINE>
 
 (ATTN: Minn., Calif., Mich., Ill.)  By DENISE GRADY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Cancer patients and others with severe pain who live
in black, Asian and Hispanic neighborhoods may have trouble getting
medicine for their pain, because their pharmacies often do not
stock morphine and related drugs, doctors are reporting.
</P>
<P>
   A survey of 347 pharmacies in New York City found that in
nonwhite neighborhoods, only 25 percent of pharmacies had enough
morphine-like drugs, or opioids, to treat severe pain. In white
neighborhoods, 72 percent of the stores had adequate supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Although the survey was conducted in New York, interviews with
pharmacists and doctors in Los Angeles, Chicago, Minneapolis and
Detroit suggested similar problems.
</P>
<P>
   Druggists who did not carry the medicines blamed low demand,
onerous regulations and fear of theft. But when the analysis of the
numbers was adjusted to take actual crime rates into account,
opioid availability was still linked to the racial makeup of the
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Some doctors who reviewed the report suggested that the real
culprit was a subtle form of racial bias.
</P>
<P>
   ``This study comes on the heels of many other studies that have
documented a disparity in treatment in which racial and ethnic
factors seem to be the predominant factor, and that's quite
disturbing,'' said Dr. Richard Payne, chief of the pain and
palliative care service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Payne did not take part in the study, but wrote an editorial
that is being published with it in Thursday's issue of The New
England Journal of Medicine. The study was directed by Dr. Sean
Morrison of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But others said racial bias was too simple an explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Selig Corman, a pharmacist who is director of professional
affairs for the Pharmacists Society of the State of New York, in
Albany, said the lack of drugs in certain neighborhoods was more
likely due to low demand, because pharmacists cannot afford to
stock drugs that people do not buy. And in low-income areas, where
many people lack insurance, sales may be slow.
</P>
<P>
   The study did not determine why demand was low _ whether, for
example, patients had been turned down and had given up asking. But
Payne said that if the claim of low demand is true, it may be
another symptom of the larger problem, that pain is inadequately
treated in minority groups, in large part because doctors do not
prescribe enough medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Reasons that have been suggested for the failure to prescribe
include the false perception among some doctors that blacks are
less sensitive to pain than whites, or more likely to be addicts.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In their editorial, Payne and his co-author, Dr. Harold Freeman,
a cancer surgeon and president of North General Hospital in
Manhattan, pointed out that of all ethnic groups, blacks have the
highest incidence and death rates from cancer; therefore, they
should need pain medication just as much, if not more than whites.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, the authors of the survey said it offered
evidence that many blacks and Hispanics, including elderly people
with cancer, either do not receive proper treatment for severe
pain, or face obstacles and delays in obtaining it.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors say the problem fits into a nationwide pattern of racial
inequality in health care, revealed by studies showing that blacks
are less likely than whites to be referred for kidney transplants
or surgery for early-stage cancers of the breast, colon or lung,
and that blacks and Hispanics are less likely to be given
painkillers for broken bones or pain following surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Morrison, a specialist in geriatrics and palliative care at
Mount Sinai, said he and his colleagues began the study because
they found that many black and Hispanic patients could not have
prescriptions filled for opioids at their neighborhood pharmacies.
Often, pharmacists would not even offer to order the products, and
when they did, it could take several days or a week for the
medicine to arrive.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Morrison described a 74-year-old Hispanic woman from the South
Bronx with severe back pain from a spinal disease, for whom he
prescribed morphine and a similar drug. When he called her the next
day, she was still in agony. Her daughter had gone to every
pharmacy in the area, but could not get either drug. The doctor
helped the daughter find a pharmacy that would fill the
prescription.
</P>
<P>
   (End Optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Morrison and his colleagues conducted a telephone survey of 347
drugstores in all five boroughs, both chain and independent, asking
pharmacists whether they stocked various forms of morphine and
other opioids like fentanyl patches, hydromorphone and oxycodone.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used census data to identify white and nonwhite
neighborhoods. They defined nonwhite areas as those in which at
least 60 percent of the residents were nonwhite. In white
neighborhoods, at least 80 percent of the residents were white.
</P>
<P>
   Although some pharmacists cited fear of robbery for not selling
opioids, Morrison and his colleagues found that when they took
actual crime rates into account, the differences were not large
enough to account for the great difference in drug availability.
</P>
<P>
   But Corman said many pharmacists feared crime nonetheless, as
well as being duped by stolen or phony prescriptions, which he said
pharmacists could be fined for filling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know some pharmacies who are very anxious about armed
robberies, and will have signs saying they don't carry narcotics,''
Corman said.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Asif Noor, a pharmacist interviewed at the Shawn Pharmacy in
Queens, said he did not carry the strongest opioids, because they
attracted addicts.
</P>
<P>
   ``People come with fake prescriptions, will start stealing and
will finish prescriptions very early and demand refills,'' Noor
said. ``Once you have junkies in the store, then the government
starts watching you.''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Schiffer, an owner of the Sunset Pharmacy in the Sunset Park
section of Brooklyn, said he had been held up for opioid drugs many
times, and that other pharmacists even had to worry about theft by
their own employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're afraid of being targets, and the poor people suffer
because of that,'' Schiffer said.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   In Minneapolis, Ed Findell, at Diamond Lake Pharmacy, said he
gave up stocking opioids in 1984 because he was held up so many
times. ``Eventually you learn and you just stop carrying it,''
Findell said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Angel T. Ponce, a cancer specialist in Los Angeles who
treats mostly blacks and Hispanics, said that a quarter of the
patients for whom he prescribed opioids come back within three
days, unable to fill their prescriptions, regardless of what kind
of insurance they had.
</P>
<P>
   In a mostly black and Hispanic neighborhood on Chicago's South
Side, Jay Patel, a pharmacist at Southern Pharmacy, said those who
stocked opioids risked being robbed and had to deal with onerous
paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a headache,'' he said.

CHALLENGING CLINTON, HOUSE BACKS BAN ON `PARTIAL BIRTH' ABORTION

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Disregarding President Clinton's promise of yet
another veto, this one in an election year, the House on Wednesday
passed a bill that would ban an abortion procedure that its
opponents call ``partial birth.''
</P>
<P>
   In what has become a routine showdown over the procedure,
replete with photographs of cuddly babies and accusations of
infanticide, 287 House members voted for the ban and 141 opposed
it, exceeding the number needed to override a presidential veto by
2 votes. Abortion rights supporters have picked up 9 votes since
the last time the House took up the measure, in 1997, mostly from
new members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In order to override a presidential veto, both the House and
Senate must pass a bill with a two-thirds majority. However, when
the Senate approved the ban in October, it fell 2 votes short of
the number needed to block a veto.
</P>
<P>
   So Wednesday's vote was a kind of kick-off for a broader
abortion rights debate, both on the campaign trail and before the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court will hear arguments this month on the
constitutionality of a ban on ``partial birth'' abortions in
Nebraska, making it the first time in eight years the court has
taken up an abortion case. Such bans have been enacted in about 30
states, but in most cases have been struck down or curtailed by
lower courts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's House vote drew a clear line between Gov. George W.
Bush, who supports a ban, and Vice President Al Gore, who opposes
one.
</P>
<P>
   Both presumed presidential nominees have tread into the
perennial debate over Roe vs. Wade, the 1973 decision that
legalized abortion. Bush supports the Republican platform opposing
abortion. And Gore, an abortion-rights backer, does not miss an
opportunity to remind voters that the next president will likely
name three Supreme Court justices, appointments that could lead to
the reversal of the Roe decision.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, several Republicans made it clear on the House
floor that the ban was one piece of a larger strategy to chip away
at the Roe decision. Public opinion surveys have shown that
abortion opponents have drawn support by focusing on this late-term
procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never in the history of man has more lip service been paid to
the needs of children, never in the history of man have so many
children been sacrificed so mercilessly in such high number,'' said
Rep. Tom DeLay, the Texan who is the third-ranking Republican in
the House. ``Abortion is a stain we must begin to wash away. A ban
on partial birth is the first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats complained that Republicans did not want to pass a
bill that Clinton would not veto _ one that would include an
exception to protect the health of the mother _ because they wanted
to use the issue for political purposes.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all about politics, not about saving lives, not about
winning hearts,'' said Rep. James Greenwood, D-Pa. ``It's about
winning seats in the Congress. It's not about making law; it's
about making noise.''
</P>
<P>
   The legislation would outlaw a kind of abortion, in which, the
bill's supporters say, a fetus is partly extracted feet first. An
instrument is then inserted into the skull, and the brain is
removed before the fetus is taken out. The procedure is used in the
second and third trimester. Exceptions to the ban would be
permitted to protect the mother's life.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the legislation argue that this kind of abortion is
never medically necessary. Its opponents counter that, while they
dislike the procedure, Congress should not dictate to doctors how
they should do their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   A ban was first passed by the House in 1995 and then again in
1997. But each time, the Senate failed to secure the votes needed
to override a presidential veto, and each time, President Clinton
vetoed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said Wednesday that Clinton would veto the
legislation again, explaining that while the president opposes
late-term abortions, he would demand exceptions to a ban in cases
where the mother's health was in jeopardy, not just cases in which
a mother might die without an abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats proposed an alternate bill that they said would have
addressed the president's concerns, but abortion opponents voted
not to consider it. Republicans argued, among other things, that
the wording would have allowed third-term abortions for mental
health reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Joseph Pitts, R-Pa., drew protests from Democrats when he
said that their suggestions on how to refine the bill would allow a
woman who was ``having a bad day'' to undergo the procedure.
</P>
<P>
   ``They would have you believe that there are women out there who
would cavalierly choose to have an abortion,'' said Rep. Rosa
DeLauro, D-Conn. ``How dare you demonize, how dare you trivialize
what women in this country do in giving birth to children?''
</P>
<P>
   The gruesomeness of the procedure has made it difficult for some
Democrats to vote against the bill, even those who support abortion
rights. For example, Rep. Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., the minority
leader, has consistently voted for the ban.

 &HT;    BellSouth, SBC shake hands on new wireless phone deal
 &HT;    By Michael E. Kanell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ BellSouth Corp. and SBC Communications Inc. unveiled
plans Wednesday to combine their U.S. wireless units into a new
company that will become the nation's second-largest carrier.
</P>
<P>
   The bold move _ coming a week after BellSouth announced a
separate stock for its multibillion-dollar Latin American business
_ will create a wireless unit with revenues of $10.2 billion and
16.2 million phone subscribers in 32 states. Only Verizon, the
24-million-subscriber joint venture of Bell Atlantic, GTE and
Vodafone AirTouch, is bigger.
</P>
<P>
   F. Duane Ackerman, BellSouth chairman and chief executive, said
during a teleconference that the company expects approval from
regulators by year's end. ``This will let us do things much faster
than either company could do on its own.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, some big-ticket action could come even before the deal
is consummated, starting perhaps with offers of flat-rate deals for
cellular phone use while traveling, said Edward E. Whitacre Jr.,
SBC chairman and CEO.
</P>
<P>
   And while the BellSouth-SBC venture is still shy of complete
coverage _ lacking, for example, metropolitan New York _ it covers
70 percent of the nation's population and can fill in the gaps by
purchasing licenses in coming auctions or buying smaller providers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chances are we will do some of both of these,'' Whitacre said.
</P>
<P>
   National ``footprints,'' like those of competitors Verizon,
Sprint and Nextel, offer the hope of eliminating roaming charges
with one-rate plans. The companies also lower costs while providing
more consistent service _ and for customers, taking everything on
the road will be increasingly key as customers buy new features
such as Internet access, said telecom analyst Jeff Kagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the U.S. marketplace is a patchwork quilt of
technologies and standards. Tomorrow, it will be a seamless
experience for the customer. SBC and BellSouth apparently read the
writing on the wall,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While falling far short of the merger once contemplated by SBC
and BellSouth, the wireless combination is a dramatic effort to
make the companies national players. With the move, the two
leapfrog past nearly everyone else _ including AT&AMP;T with its 11
million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   They also preserve their option to make the arrangement more
than just an alliance.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying this will happen, but many mergers start with
partnerships,'' said Rikki Lee, editor of Wireless Week.
</P>
<P>
   SBC _ the larger company _ will own 60 percent, and BellSouth 40
percent of the venture, but the companies will share control: Each
will have the same number of board members and top executives.
SBC's ownership share will be larger, but BellSouth added its
national wireless data unit to the package.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both companies believe that wireless data is a significant
part of the future growth of the company,'' Ackerman said.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Wireless Data, based in New Jersey, is the company's
only nationwide offering. The unit offers interactive paging and
its network also carries messages from the popular Palm VII.
Moreover, America Online plans to deliver its wireless applications
via the BellSouth network.
</P>
<P>
   SBC and BellSouth have not settled on a name for the venture,
but say they will somehow preserve their own brand recognition in
selling the service. Among other questions left unanswered are a
headquarters location and a chief executive to run the unit.
</P>
<P>
   While the venture will meld the work forces of SBC and
BellSouth, the companies say they have no plans at this time to
shift employees.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has about 10,000 employees in its wireless unit.
</P>
<P>
   Executives and some managers might be concerned, since the
venture is likely to mean consolidation at the top. But field staff
may be fairly safe: Wireless is a rapidly growing industry, and if
nothing else, the deal will give sales people more ways to sell
service.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth and SBC overlap in their coverage only in New Orleans
and Indianapolis, where one or the other would sell that property.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies also share the same technology through most of
their networks. Where they differ, they are planning to use the
next generation of phones that will be able to shift back and forth
as a user travels from one area to another.
</P>
<P>
   The new wireless company is expected to eventually sell stock,
although BellSouth and SBC would presumably retain control. When
that public offering occurs, SBC and BellSouth hope to let
investors see and value wireless by itself, separate from the
traditional phone businesses that have lately been in disfavor.
</P>
<P>
   But just rumors of a deal, followed by the announcement, helped
boost both stocks. On a day that the Dow Jones industrial average
dropped 131 points, SBC rose 31.25 cents to close at $46.3125 per
share. BellSouth, which was trading below $40 weeks ago, climbed
37.5 cents to close at $49.25.
</P>
<P>
   Talks aimed at an alliance have been an open secret for weeks,
and analysts have praised the arrangement as a benefit for both
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony Ferrugia, analyst for AG Edwards, said the deal's
long-term stock value hinges less on spotlighting wireless than on
the companies' competitive positions. ``A joint venture would
probably help them in terms of the stock,'' he said, ``but the
reason it would is it would change things operationally, giving the
companies a bigger footprint.''
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth estimates the venture will be worth upwards of $70
billion _ and that estimate could be conservative. ``Pure play''
wireless companies have often been valued by investors at more than
$9,000 a subscriber. Nextel, for instance, has fewer than 5 million
subscribers and a market value of $47 billion.
</P>
<P>
   By that measure, the BellSouth-SBC company could be worth more
than $100 billion.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth has long been praised by analysts for its cautious,
frugal management _ a reputation that hasoffered little bump to the
stock in the epoch of the Internet boom. Some analysts have come to
see BellSouth as bait for a big acquisitor; the company has
probably been more aggressive in the past year than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Last spring, BellSouth bought 10 percent of Qwest
Communications. More recently, BellSouth took an interest in
Dutch-based KPN Telecom, confirmed plans to put its television
service on satellite throughout the Southeast and announced its
Latin American tracking stock.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the SBC deal, negotiated by the same BellSouth team
that hammered out the agreements with KPN Telecom and Qwest.
</P>
<P>
   At least some of the impetus for the high-stakes partnership
comes from the top. Ackerman and Whitacre are both longtime
veterans of the old AT&AMP;T system who get along well enough to have
gone bird hunting together.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot depends on the personalities of the people running these
companies,'' said Elliott Hamilton, vice president of the Strategis
Group. ``People forget that.''

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHARGES LOCKHEED WITH VIOLATING EXPORT LAWS
</HEADLINE>
 By JEFF GERTH  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The State Department has charged the Lockheed
Martin Corp. with 30 violations of arms export laws in connection
with its help in evaluating problems in Chinese-made satellite
technology in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The claims, which expose the aerospace company to a possible
penalty of $15 million, were outlined in a letter sent to Lockheed
Martin on Tuesday by the Office of Defense Trade Controls, the
State Department entity that supervises the export of
military-related goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are 1994 communications by Lockheed Martin rocket
specialists about Chinese-made kick motors, the rocket-motor
technology used to lift a satellite into its final orbit. At the
time, Chinese kick motors had suffered multiple failures, the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed Martin's specialists went to China in January 1994 for
discussions with a state-owned Chinese rocket company and later
prepared a report for Lockheed's customer, a Hong Kong satellite
company that was planning to use the kick motor in a 1995 satellite
launching, the letter said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has accused the company of violating the
terms of its export license by discussing the motors and passing on
the report to its Hong Kong client without the department's written
approval.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was provided to The New York Times by Lockheed
officials who said they intended to contest the accusations. If the
case is not settled, it will be heard by an administrative law
judge.
</P>
<P>
   The Lockheed officials said that the company had offered to
resolve the case by paying a fine of several million dollars, but
that the State Department had rejected the offer.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department spokesman, James P. Rubin, said the
department viewed the matter as serious, in part because ``any
assistance to Chinese technical capabilities in space launch has
the potential to be applied to missile development.''
</P>
<P>
   The activities under scrutiny occurred in a different era for
both the company and the government. The help concerning kick
motors was provided by Martin Marietta before it merged with
Lockheed. At the time, the Clinton administration was encouraging
more commercial interchange between U.S. satellite makers and their
Chinese counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   But Congress tightened the rules following disclosures in 1998
that Loral Space and Communications was under criminal
investigation for helping Chinese rocket makers solve problems in
1996 with rocket and missile-related technology.
</P>
<P>
   Loral has denied any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials said that the information transferred in
1996 by Loral officials to a Chinese aerospace company raised more
concerns than Martin Marietta's report in 1994 to its Hong Kong
client.
</P>
<P>
   Lockheed officials said they did not believe the 1994 activities
were being reviewed by the Justice Department.

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to reputation, good images go down
the drain fast. Ask Bill Clinton. Ask Gary Hart. Negative images
are a lot tougher; they've got real staying power. Ask Michael
Dukakis about the tank, or Edmund Muskie about his tears.
</P>
<P>
   President Ronald Reagan, who knew a lot about image power, had a
habit of arranging important ribbon cuttings or attendance at
charitable events whenever he had just done something unpopular, so
the good image would upstage the bad.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the media are assumed to be all-powerful, ethnic and
religious groups immediately cry prejudice when negative public
images come calling, but forthe better part of history, that would
not have done much good. Most groups did not have access to public
forums where their complaints could be heard; others would not have
been listened to anyway, had they raised their voices. Ask
African-Americans about that. The recent shooting of Amadou Diallo
still looks a lot like a moment when an image took over, with fatal
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflections in Black: A History of Black Photographers, 1840
to the Present,'' an exhibition through June 30 at the Arts and
Industries building of the Smithsonian Institution here, is a
history with a provocative notion at its core: that at various
times, but especially in the first several decades of the 20th
century, American blacks used photography to resist the image the
dominant culture imposed on them.
</P>
<P>
   Without a common program, perhaps even without a fully conscious
intent, people all over the nation devised a way to see themselves
as they were or wished to be, no matter what white society had in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   This idea isn't entirely new, nor is this the first historical
show of black photographers in America, though it is by far the
largest and most wide ranging. In ``Reflections in Black,'' Deborah
Willis, curator of exhibitions at the Smithsonian's Center for
African-American History and Culture, has assembled more than 300
images by 120 photographers, many previously unknown or little
known. The show will tour nationally, including a stop at the
Studio Museum in Harlem in 2001, and in May, W.W. Norton will
publish Willis' book of the same name, the first comprehensive
history of its kind, with close to 600 reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   The show, largely portraits in the early years, begins with
1840s daguerreotypes (some in modern, silver-print copies) and
progresses to C.M. Battey's early 20th-century pictures of a
relaxed but entirely commanding Booker T. Washington and an
intense, fiercely concentrated W.E.B. Du Bois. The 1930s produced
character studies of back-country people like the sturdy women P.H.
Polk called ``The Boss'' and ``The Pipe Smoker,'' or James Van Der
Zee's extravagantly posed big-city career dandy with cane, spats
and cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the material from this period is more interesting
historically than aesthetically, a common occurrence in historical
shows, and the section on recent ``art'' photography is vastly
uneven, as contemporary surveys so often are. But the subject alone
is compelling, and there is more than enough to engage the eye and
mind in pictures like J.P. Ball's cabinet card photograph printed
as if it were on a curling piece of paper, or James Latimer Allen's
moody 1920s portrait of Langston Hughes, or Ernest C. Withers' 1968
picture of the Sanitation Men's march in which everyone carried
signs saying ``I Am A Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Shows based on ethnic or gender identity prompt the question:
doesn't the photography matter more than the color (nationality,
ethnicity, gender) of the photographers? Yes, but this photography
remained virtually unseen by the larger culture for years, because
it too was segregated until after the civil rights era.
</P>
<P>
   The black press printed the picture of 14-year-old Emmett Till's
battered face after he was brutally murdered by whites in 1955; the
white press did not. The 1982 edition of Beaumont Newhall's
``History of Photography'' did not include a single black
photographer; neither did Jonathan Green's ``American Photography:
A Critical History'' in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the black image was distorted by widespread,
disparaging assumptions about race. In the 19th century, a theory
was abroad that dark skin was a sign of genetic inferiority. At
mid-century, even as black daguerreotypists in the North
photographed black men in frock coats and women in elegant dresses,
Louis Agassiz, the Harvard anthropologist, commissioned photographs
of naked slaves meant to reinforce his ideas about the defects of
their race.
</P>
<P>
   The best Frederick Douglass' Paper in New York could do to
counter this was to write of a Cincinnati studio, owned by a black
photographer and hugely successful with both black and white
customers, that it was ``one of the best answers to the charge of
natural inferiority we have lately met with.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Cartoonish and stereotyped images of African-Americans, all of
which took for granted subordinate status and intelligence,
continued well into the 20th century in minstrel shows, postcard
pictures of lazy fishermen and watermelon eaters, films, ads, jokey
salt shakers and cookie jars. And these were merely the milder
evidence of a dehumanized view that made it possible for whites to
smile at lynchings, as they do in the chilling photographic show
now at the New-York Historical Society.
</P>
<P>
   This was tantamount to visual warfare against a group that could
not fight back. Creating dignified images within that group was one
means of defense. And cameras in black hands bestowed the precious
gift of shaping one's own public persona rather than depending on
others, or submitting to them.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to shape one's own public (and private) image is the
beginning of empowerment. Family snapshots are not included in
``Black Reflections,'' but black homes were full of them, and as
family snaps do, they constructed, sometimes concocted, stories
about ``good'' families. Pictures of past generations must have
been even more important to African-Americans than to whites; they
proposed an alternative to the genealogy of slavery.
</P>
<P>
   Control over the images of others exerts control over the way
the others are regarded and influences the way society treats them.
During World War II, American posters pictured the Japanese as
yellow devils, encouraging a degree of generalized hate that made
the heavy losses in the Pacific more bearable and the internment of
Japanese-Americans more nearly acceptable.
</P>
<P>
   On another level, the Nazis repeatedly identified the Jews as
Schweinehunde, filthy swine, a tag that branded them less than
human.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992, Roger Wilkins wrote that blacks were mistaken to
believe that the power to segregate was the greatest power used
against them. The real weapon, he said, was ``the power to define
reality where blacks are concerned and to manage perceptions and
therefore arrange politics and culture to reinforce those
definitions.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflections in Black'' offers evidence that from the later
years of the 19th century, as more African-Americans were educated
and financially successful, they worked at least within their
communities to redefine their realities and manage their own
perceptions.
</P>
<P>
   By then, as images spread and gained power, photographs were a
common instrument for mild self-aggrandizement and the kind of
self-invention that pervades so much studio portraiture and so many
family albums. But African-Americans had more than the usual
reasons for wanting their successes commemorated, and fewer places
to display them.
</P>
<P>
   If the white world did not see documents of black pride, the
record was always visible to the people it depicted, and it must
have been a silent support as well as a counterweight, perhaps even
a gesture of defiance, to the postcards and salt cellars.
</P>
<P>
   A wall text for ``Reflections in Black'' notes that most of the
photographs are not about race because African-Americans were not
obsessed with race. Like everyone else, they were probably more
preoccupied with earning a living, raising a family and making a
life within or against whatever limitations hemmed them in.
</P>
<P>
   Among blacks in the first part of the 20th century there was a
division between Booker T. Washington's call for accommodation to
the status quo and W.E.B. Du Bois' appeal to struggle for equal
rights, but just about everybody wanted the good life as Americans
saw it.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of the small ironies of history that a dominated
people so often yearn to be like their dominators; to judge by the
photographs, the black community, withdrawn as it was from the
white community and essentially invisible to it, still imitated it
in many ways, at least in the externals of dress, possessions,
rituals, even class structures.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1930s, photojournalism had moved to the forefront, and
the civil rights movement in the 1960s made it an imperative for
African-Americans like Jonathan Eubanks, Joe Flowers, Robert L.
Haggins, Moneta J. Sleet Jr. and Ernest C. Withers. By then it was
impossible (italics)not(end italics) to be obsessed by race.
</P>
<P>
   Many liberal white photographers and a few blacks viewed that
conflict from the black viewpoint in the early years, providing the
press with brutal images of white attacks. After the mid-60s, when
the Black Power movement excluded longtime white supporters and
African-Americans rioted and fought back, the camera viewpoint
shifted to the position of whites facing attack from blacks, and
blacks were pictured more as aggressors than victims, a subtle
change in news reports that must have influenced the way a changing
reality was seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflections in Black'' includes very few purely artistic
photographs before the 1970s, art photography being a poor way to
earn a living, as even white photographers knew. Racism would have
made a hard course even harder, so black photographers assigned
themselves other tasks. Today, redressing racial grievances, or
just bringing black life into the light, has become a primary task
_ heavy work, which has been known to produce art that is heavy,
too, rather than weighty.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But good art, as well. Recent documentary photographs by people
like Chester Higgins Jr., a New York Times photographer, and
Marilyn Nance respectfully explore the role of religion among
African- Americans. The art photographers are often feistier. Pat
Ward Williams uses images, text and objects to address the choices
presented by light skin color; Amalia Amaki spells out the central
role of photographs in black families by printing family snapshots
on a cotton quilt; Albert Chong, who is half black and half Asian,
attempts to reconcile his double heritage on paper.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie Mae Weems comments pointedly on art and artists' models
in a five-part series of herself, sometimes naked, seen in a
bedroom mirror. One caption reads, ``It was clear, I was not
Manet's type Picasso _ who had a way with women _ only used me and
Duchamp never even considered me.'' This might be a feminist
complaint about the way male artists regarded their female models _
or a black woman's observation about the place of black women in
the early years of modern art.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflections in Black'' brings up a number of facts that will
be little known to whites. Item: Jules Lion, a black man who had
immigrated from France, was the first daguerreotypist in New
Orleans, taking pictures by 1840. (Unfortunately, none survive.)
Item: during the 1840s, there were 50 documented black
daguerreotypists running galleries in American cities.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1850s, African-American photographers showed in group
exhibitions and took home prizes. In the 1860s, as more
African-Americans moved from rural to urban areas, ads for black
photographers and printers (and for some white photographers) began
to appear in black newspapers, which obviously served a sizable
population that read the paper and could pay to be commemorated.
</P>
<P>
   J.P. Ball, a black abolitionist in Cincinnati, photographed the
white abolitionists in his city in the 1850s. In fact, though race
is not always identifiable from appearances, it is clear that
before the Civil War and at some points after it, black
photographers had white patrons, and sometimes a lot of them.
</P>
<P>
   For Northerners who had abolitionist leanings, it might have
been a point of pride to frequent a black establishment; in other
cases, the African-American studio may simply have been the best
one around.
</P>
<P>
   African-American photography grew in stature, variety and
artistry as blacks began to form their own societies late in the
19th century in response to hardening racial attitudes and Jim Crow
laws. Morehouse College and Howard University had been founded two
years after the Civil War; other black colleges soon followed, and
by 1897 black intellectuals had founded the American Negro Academy.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later Booker T. Washington organized the National
Negro Business League. A new elite prospered in the first decades,
and talented photographers like Addison N. Scurlock, C.M. Battey,
Florine Perrault Collins, P.H. Polk, James Van Der Zee and James
Latimer Allen signed on to make them look good.
</P>
<P>
   In 1900 the census listed 247 black photographers; in 1930 it
listed 545, more than twice as many. With their cameras, they
documented not just men wearing boutonnieres, women in dressmaker
gowns and children in lace-trimmed dresses but typewriting clubs
and high school cooking classes, college commencement days,
businesses, Emancipation Day parades. (Emancipation Day was
celebrated by blacks all over the country.)
</P>
<P>
   They clearly believed Marcus Garvey when he said ``Black is
beautiful'' back in 1910. They did not, could not, establish a good
image for African-Americans in the culture at large, yet it is just
possible they helped prepare the ground. It is easier to stand up
tall if your self-image says you should, and easier to fight for
your rights if you are standing up to begin with. &QL;

 &HT;    Ace is the place for Internet visits on in-store kiosks
 &HT;    By Patti Bond
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ace Hardware is bringing Internet shopping to stores
in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The country's second-largest hardware chain has installed kiosks
in two stores that link shoppers to its Internet partner,
OurHouse.com. Consumers using the computer terminals can look up
and purchase products, as well as order installation and household
repairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're aiming to offer virtually anything that takes care of
the home,'' said Gary Briggs, founder and chief marketing officer
of OurHouse.com. Briggs is promoting the kiosks this week in
Atlanta at Ace's spring convention, which starts today at the
Georgia World Congress Center and runs through Monday.
</P>
<P>
   OurHouse.com hopes to sign up about 2,000 Ace dealers at the
show. About 1,200 of its 5,100 independent dealer stores already
have signed up, Briggs said.
</P>
<P>
   The kiosk program is Ace's latest move into online shopping.
Last fall the Oak Brook, Ill., dealer-owned cooperative bought a 20
percent stake in OurHouse.com, which exclusively promotes and
distributes Ace products.
</P>
<P>
   Ace and other home improvement retailers have moved quickly in
recent months to sell their goods via the Internet, where they can
get a head start on Home Depot and Lowe's Cos. Those two
``big-box'' retailers still are fine-tuning their Internet
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   Last month TruServ Corp., the largest hardware store chain,
began selling 3,000 hand and power tools through Truevalue.com. By
midyear, TruServ plans to sell about 20,000 items on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Ace started selling products through the OurHouse.com Web site
in November. Ace now is promoting the kiosks to its dealers as a
way to make stronger links with the shoppers in the stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest advantage is that it expands our product offerings
and services,'' said Rodney Etheredge, general manager of six Ace
company-owned stores in Atlanta. ``Most of the Ace retailers do a
good business in special orders. Having the kiosks for online
ordering will be great.''
</P>
<P>
   The typical Ace store carries 13,000 to 15,000 products.
OurHouse.com currently offers 22,000 products and is adding about
3,000 items a month, said Briggs of OurHouse.com.
</P>
<P>
   The retail store gets an undisclosed percentage of any sale made
through a kiosk, he said. Also, OurHouse.com is putting store
coupons in the boxes it ships to consumers to drive traffic back
into the store.
</P>
<P>
   Ace will test the Web stations for a month before beginning a
nationwide rollout, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Home Depot plans to begin selling products online
in a city-by-city launch that will begin in the summer. North
Wilkesboro, N.C.-based Lowe's will begin a major online sales push
nationwide in the summer. It already sells some products through
manufacturer Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   This month Lowe's is setting up ``Web lounges'' in 30 stores to
test online appliance sales, said spokesman Brian Peace.

JUDGE PUTS PENALTY PHASE OF MICROSOFT TRIAL ON `FAST TRACK' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case set a
``fast-track'' schedule on Wednesday designed to conclude the
proceeding and impose a remedy roughly by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   And with that deadline looming, the state attorneys general, the
plaintiffs who have favored the strongest remedies, are coalescing
around the view that they will not seek a breakup of the company,
several officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on timing came in a meeting on Wednesday morning
between Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and lawyers for the
government and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an expedited process that everyone agreed on,'' said
Joel Klein, head of the the Justice Department's antitrust
division. The Justice Department prevailed in the case when Jackson
ruled on Monday that Microsoft was a ``predatory'' monopolist that
had acted illegally to protect its market domination.
</P>
<P>
   With this fast-track schedule, the judge appeared to drop the
idea, discussed at a meeting earlier this week, of immediately
appealing his own findings of law to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, before he deliberates on a
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now entering the remedy phase, and I am very much
desirous of having an appellate panel take a look at my work
product so far, and would prefer if we were able to conclude the
remedy phase on a fast track,'' the judge told the parties during a
meeting on Tuesday. He did not raise the idea on Wednesday,
however.
</P>
<P>
   It also remained possible that Jackson might encourage an appeal
directly to the Supreme Court once the proceedings are over _
another idea he mentioned on Tuesday. Microsoft would almost
certainly oppose that because in previous rulings some judges on
the appeals court have agreed with some of the company's positions.
For the same reasons, government officials would probably favor a
direct appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan announced on Wednesday, the state and federal
governments must submit their remedy proposal to the judge no later
than April 28, and Microsoft is to offer its reply on May 10. A
court hearing, presumably with witnesses, would begin on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jackson clearly indicated that he would prefer to receive
a single remedy proposal from the state and federal officials _ and
the parties said they would work hard to comply _ he also told them
they could submit two if they could not agree.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, who
participated in the meeting by conference call, said: ``We expect
to be working with the Justice Department in the same kind of
cooperative spirit'' that was in evidence during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also told the states that they should submit a
proposal ``preferred by a majority of the plaintiff states'' _ an
important pronouncement because it would not allow a handful of
states to hold out for their preferred remedy against the will of
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   As one official said last week in the final days of the
court-ordered settlement talks, ``All it takes is for one attorney
general to say no, and there's no settlement.'' Presumably,
Jackson's instruction would eliminate that threat in the remedy
process.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 state attorneys general hold a range of opinions on
remedies, and some of them believe that only a structural remedy,
like breaking up the company, will work, officials said. But a
growing number of influential attorneys general now hold the view
that breaking up the company is ``too radical,'' as more than one
official said on Wednesday, adding that it might not hold up on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And, significantly, since Jackson has ordered the states to send
him only the majority opinion, hard-liners who held out for a
stronger remedy would be likely to lose influence.
</P>
<P>
   A remedy that would simply constrain Microsoft's behavior while
keeping the company intact would be ``more palatable at the appeals
level and maybe easier to implement,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``the few cases'' of hard-line attorneys generals who say
they could not accept such a remedy, the official said they
probably could be persuaded to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   A state official who said he was familiar with the views of the
hard-liners, said the other attorneys general would ``have to show
a really bulletproof conduct remedy proposal'' to bring them
around. Even with Jackson's new majority-rules directive, he added,
the hard-liners could ``still make a lot of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials say they have not made up their
minds about what remedies to recommend. And Joel Klein, who heads
the Justice Department's antitrust division, generally does not
disclose his decisions on big issues like this, even to some of his
colleagues, until sometime near the deadline, several officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, serious disagreements arose between the state and federal
officials in the settlement talks that ended on Saturday. The
federal officials offered behavioral remedies that most of the
attorneys general _ even those now talking about conduct remedies _
considered far too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Two issues most concerned them. The Justice Department proposal
would have allowed Microsoft to continue folding new products into
the operating system and declaring them to be a part of Windows.
Microsoft's management has repeatedly said that was a right they
were unwilling to give up.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials said such a compromise would allow Microsoft
to continue to use its Windows operating-system monopoly to
overpower competitors. This is the very behavior that prompted the
present suit, and Jackson, in his ruling, demonstrated clear
concern over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's federal settlement proposal also had no clear
enforcement mechanism, several officials said. Under that plan, if
a competitor determined that Microsoft was violating the terms of
the settlement, its only recourse would have been to complain to
the government, which could choose to take Microsoft back to court.
For a variety of reasons, few companies would have been likely to
complain _ particularly if the November elections produced a
Republican administration uninterested in antitrust enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of more direct and immediate enforcement ideas have
been discussed, including perhaps appointing a special court master
with enforcement authority.

NEW YORK POLICE RECRUITING HAS NEW PROBLEM: LOS ANGELES
</HEADLINE>

 By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For two years, New York City has been struggling to
attract applicants to take the Police Department's admissions test,
battling a downward trend that saw the number of applicants plummet
from 31,000 in 1996 to fewer than half that number last year.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday, despite last year's $10 million recruiting
campaign, police officials learned that the number had dropped
sharply again: only 6,000 people have expressed interest in the
latest exam, forcing the city to extend the application deadline
for a second time, to April 20.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials, union leaders and critics of the department
have described a list of factors that have hindered local
recruiting: the relatively low pay for rookies, the sizzling
private-sector economy, the strained relations with minority
residents and the shootings of unarmed men that have prompted
public outcry.
</P>
<P>
   Now add this: poaching. Even as the city struggles to lure its
residents to its own department, police recruiters from Los Angeles
have come to New York's own turf, offering promises of warmer
climes, higher starting salaries and openings at the academy as
soon as this summer. And they are having surprising success.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're probably fielding 300 or 400 phone calls a day just from
people in New York City asking for information about the test,''
said Los Angeles Police Officer Jose A. Ferreira, who is recruiting
this week at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan.
``With our salaries, and with living in L.A. being what it is _ the
beaches, the weather _ we're finding a lot of people who are
attracted to this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Out-of-town recruiting is not a new phenomenon, and no one
claims it has caused the steep drops in applicants to New York's
department. But the visit by the Los Angeles recruiters, their
first in nearly 20 years, is remarkable for its scale _ and for its
timing.
</P>
<P>
   Not only have they arrived at a time when fewer people are
applying to New York's Police Academy, but they are directly
competing for minority applicants. The Los Angeles department has
run advertisements on minority radio stations, inviting all New
Yorkers _ not just students at John Jay College _ to take the test.
It is part of a national recruitment effort by the department,
which seeks to add 1,000 officers to its ranks, Ferreira said.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, 34 percent of the department's 40,000 officers are
black, Hispanic or Asian. The Los Angles Police Department, with
9,600 sworn officers, has a minority representation of 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that the possibility that Los Angeles police
recruiting would be successful in New York underscores the serious
problem that NYPD has in recruiting minorities,'' said Norman
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union.
``It illustrates what some of us in the civil rights community have
said, which is that you can get African-Americans, Latinos and
Asians interested in applying for your police department, if you
send out the message that you want them to apply.''
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir said criticism of the
department's recruiting was ``made of whole cloth'' because the
department has a list of people who have passed the test in recent
years that is far larger than the 3,000 to 6,000 openings he
expects at the academy in the next two years. No one can say how
many people on the waiting list are still available to be hired.
And by extending the deadline Wednesday, it was clear the
department is still seeking fresh talent.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of declining applications, he said, had little to do
with the department's ability to fill its ranks. He said the drop
in applicants was a natural extension of the booming economy and
what he described as negative coverage of the department by the
news media.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, based on the media attention, and the way the
department has been portrayed in the media,'' he said, ``it is not
surprising to me that the people are not applying in the numbers
they applied in the past.''
</P>
<P>
   Safir also said the Los Angeles was forced on the road to
recruit because it could not find enough applicants in its own
region. In New York, recruiters have not had to travel to fill the
department, he said, except for trips to military bases to recruit
veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Jerome H. Skolnick, a professor at New York University
School of Law who teaches a seminar in police practices, said the
recent decline is grounds for serious concern. ``I think this is
really a crisis now _ the small number of potential recruits,''
Skolnick said. ``There is the danger that you may have so few
applicants that you can not get the quality you desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Like police officials, Skolnick said the prosperous economy has
caused the decline. But he also said the cases of Abner Louima, who
was tortured in a Brooklyn police station, and Amadou Diallo, who
was killed by the police on the doorstep of his house, have raised
awareness of racial tension between the department and the city's
residents, discouraging some applicants from even considering the
test. ``Among blacks, it is likely that there is a stigma to saying
I am going to be a New York cop,'` he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Patrick Lynch, president of the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, said he agreed that the perception of the department
has suffered in recent years. But he said New York City's drop in
applicants, and Los Angeles' prediction of success on the New
York's turf, can be attributed to a simple factor: pay. Police
salaries in Los Angeles start at $41,000 each year; in New York,
salaries start at $34,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lynch said the gap is particularly aggravating to the union
because New York's recruits are required to have completed 60
college credits or two years of military service for admission to
the academy. In Los Angeles, cadets are admitted to the academy
with only a high school diploma.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fairly obvious that the New York Police
Department is not paying a livable wage,'' Lynch said. ``Our rookie
officers are taking home $700 every two weeks. That's not enough to
put food on the table, much less pay the rent. We have young
officers living in the basements of their parent's homes, while I
think Los Angeles is an example of a department that is paying its
officers a livable wage, which allows people to follow their
passions.''
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles police hope to take advantage of this gap
Thursday. At 8 a.m., in an auditorium at John Jay College, Ferreira
will reach into one of 19 sealed boxes, remove bundles of
standardized tests and distribute them to rows of potential
recruits. And by Saturday evening, when the last would-be rookie
has taken the test, Ferreira and his six colleagues expect to have
screened as many as 4,000 applicants, an accomplishment in three
days that rivals the New York Police Department's recruiting effort
so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   On the campus Wednesday, students who met with the Los Angeles
recruiting team had money on their minds. Ato Gordon, 22, a senior
from Canarsie, Brooklyn, met with the officers near the cafeteria.
He and his peers asked questions about police-community relations
and the Los Angeles crime rate, but they also asked about the cost
of renting an apartment. Gordon eyed the salary on the LAPD
literature.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could be in Beverly Hills right now driving around,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Skolnick also described another phenomenon. The New York
department is not alone in receiving harsh criticism, he noted,
even as crime has declined. The department in Los Angeles has been
roiled by its share of scandals during the past decade, including
the beating of Rodney King by officers and the controversial tenure
of former Chief Daryl Gates during the early 1990s, as well as the
recent decision by Chief Bernard Parks to disband an anti-gang unit
that had been at the heart of a corruption and brutality scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the students who were interviewed seemed to know any
substantive details about recent controversies in Los Angeles. And
many were in their preteen years when Rodney King was beaten, and
the riots erupted in 1992. Skolnick said perhaps when a department
recruits away from the area in which it serves, it enjoys less
biased view among the pool of applicants.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think some of the reason for the Los Angeles police coming
to New York is that they don't have the local stigma in New York,''
he said. ``Knowing this, maybe New York ought to go to Los Angeles
to recruit.''

COUNCIL SEEKS   JUSTICE INQUIRY   OF THE POLICE   IN LOS ANGELES 
</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Concerned about internecine warfare between law
enforcement officials and potential conflicts of interest, the Los
Angeles City Council voted Wednesday to ask the U.S. Justice
Department to take over the investigation of corruption in the
police department.
</P>
<P>
   On a 10-1 vote, the city council passed a resolution asking the
Justice Department to become the lead agency coordinating the
local, state and federal authorities involved in the investigation
and prosecution of charges of brutality, evidence planting and
false testimony centered in the Los Angeles Police Department's
Rampart Division.
</P>
<P>
   The request came on the same day that officials announced the
filing of federal civil rights charges against one current and one
former Los Angeles police officer from the department's 77th Street
station in the South-Central area. The charges stem from a 1995
incident in which the two officers were said to have planted a gun
on an innocent man and had him prosecuted for possession of a
concealed weapon. The man, Victor Tyson, was exonerated on a
judicial finding of innocence, in which a judge, regardless of a
jury's decision, essentially acquits a defendant.
</P>
<P>
   The Rampart scandal was unleashed by the statements of one
officer, Rafael Perez, who in exchange for a lighter sentence on
charges of stealing cocaine from an evidence locker has told the
authorities about widespread corruption at the Rampart Division.
Last week, prosecutors went to court to have four more convictions
overturned, bringing to 50 the number that have been thrown out as
a result of Perez's statements. Though no officers have yet been
criminally charged, the police department has filed administrative
charges against 10 officers implicated in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, Police Chief Bernard Parks and District
Attorney Gil Garcetti have warred openly about the course of the
investigation, with Garcetti saying the police department refused
to provide him with necessary information, and the chief saying
that Garcetti manufactured the controversy over the information for
political gain. Despite a rebuke of Parks by the Police Commission
and assurances from both parties that they would work together, the
two officials feuded as recently as last week over whether to grant
officers immunity from administrative discipline for failing to
come forward sooner if they would agree to do so now.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski, who co-sponsored the request
approved by the council Wednesday, has expressed growing uneasiness
with the potential for conflicts of interest with agencies _ from
the local to the federal level _ investigating themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office has been reported to have ignored
early warnings about the credibility of Perez, and in at least one
case declined to prosecute an officer fired after he was accused of
beating a gang member. And news reports have raised questions about
FBI and Immigration Service involvement with Rampart officers.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   The request for outside intervention is considered evidence of
city officials' dismay over the behavior of their top law
enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   Mike Feuer, another sponsor of the request, said he felt the
criminal inquiry had been imperiled by infighting. ``I think it's
come down to this: We can continue to allow the investigation and
the prosecution arising from Rampart to be undermined by the
finger-pointing and the backbiting, or we can try to adopt a
different approach,'' Feuer said.

 &HT;    Bus ride gains supporters; Coca-Cola boycott hinted
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A coalition of advocacy groups has offered its support
to organizers of a bus ``ride for justice'' against Coca-Cola to
get the company to settle an employee racial discrimination case
quickly.
</P>
<P>
   The Coalition for the People's Agenda _ which includes the NAACP
in Georgia, Concerned Black Clergy, the Georgia Association of
Black Elected Officials, the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference and the Coalition of Black Women _ says it will also
help raise funds to underwrite the costs of the April 15 trip from
Atlanta to the company's annual shareholders meeting in Wilmington,
Del., on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   The chief organizer of the trip, former Coca-Cola human
resources manager Larry Jones, said a boycott of the company's
products will be called if substantial progress to settle the suit
is not made before the buses roll.
</P>
<P>
   ``There must be a definite movement toward settlement on the
part of the company by April 15, or we will call a boycott of
company products on the 15th,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   He and a group of former and current employees are organizing
the three-bus convoy that will stop for rallies in three cities
before reaching the shareholders meeting. About 55 out of 150
people have signed up to ride the buses so far, and about $15,000
out of the $60,000 needed for the trip has been raised, Jones said.

   The Coalitoin for the People's Agenda said it will press for a
meeting with Coca-Cola executives ``to urge them to do the right
thing and avoid a national boycott.'' Last week, the Rev. Jesse
Jackson was in Atlanta to try to persuade the company to settle the
suit. The company has said it is seeking a speedy and equitable
resolution, and a court-ordered mediator is attempting to
facilitate one.
</P>
<P>
   The federal suit, filed by eight current and former employees,
alleges that Coca-Cola has discriminated against African-Americans
in pay, promotions and performance evaluations. The plaintiffs are
seeking class-action status so they can represent about 2,000 other
current and former black employees in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The company has denied the suit's allegations and opposed
plaintiffs' efforts to make it a class-action case.

<P>
   HOUSTON _ One last question for Stig Andersen (the G is silent),
the athletic tenor from Denmark. Suppose singing had not worked
out. What would he have done instead?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am a ceramicist,'' he answers. ``I make pots. I like to work
against some resistance. I don't like clay that's too soft or too
weak. I have to have something to grab.''
</P>
<P>
   Andersen, it turns out, used to own his own kiln, but he sold it
years ago along with all his tools. When does a tenor have time to
throw pots? Still, I wonder: Was his style rugged and sturdy?
Smooth and fragile?
</P>
<P>
   ``The big forms were quite rough, but within that I like very
delicate lines,'' he says. ``I like that contradiction.''
</P>
<P>
   I jot this down. ``Maybe it sounds as if it had something to do
with the way I sing,'' he concludes, reading my mind.
</P>
<P>
   This exchange took place recently backstage at the Houston Grand
Opera, where Andersen was appearing in ``Tristan und Isolde.''
Offstage, his bright eyes, broad cheekbones and shock of healthy
chestnut hair made a happier impression than in the role of
Tristan, that gloomy lover born to ``yearn and die.''
</P>
<P>
   In jeans and a biker's jacket, looking less tall but stouter in
person than onstage, he still seemed an exceptionally plausible
physical match for Wagner's Siegfried, the role that takes him to
the Metropolitan Opera for his house debut on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The protagonist of the second half of Wagner's four-part epic,
``Der Ring des Nibelungen,'' Siegfried enters the action in the
opera that bears his name, proceeding to his tragic end in the
concluding opera, ``Gotterdammerung,'' which Andersen sings on
April 22, to complete the Met's first cycle of the season. He
returns early next month in the season's third and last ``Ring.''
(Wolfgang Neumann is Siegfried in the second cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   OK, Andersen does the work of a heldentenor, a fabled beast like
the unicorn, much in demand. But what is a heldentenor, exactly?
And is Andersen the Real Thing?
</P>
<P>
   ``Held'' meaning hero, we associate the term above all with the
heroic music dramas of Wagner. The prototype remains Lauritz
Melchior, another Dane, who towered over the 1930s and '40s, rising
to Wagner's challenges with matchless stamina, brilliance and
brawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the common taxonomy of vocal types, heroic (or ``dramatic'')
voices lie at the far end of a spectrum from the lyric variety. The
distinction is a mite crude.
</P>
<P>
   ``If by `dramatic' you mean singing loud all the way through, in
my opinion that's not dramatic but boring,'' Andersen said. ``If
`lyric' means that you're trying to express the words and emotions,
then yes, I'm lyric, and maybe I'm singing the wrong repertoire.
But I'm convinced Wagner never meant us to shout all the time. He
wants everything, from extra loudness to extra silence. In whatever
I sing, I try to find the right color for every moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Houston ``Tristan,'' with Renate Behle as Isolde, gave a
clear account of what Andersen has to offer. The poignant longing
in his early lines describing the view from ship to shore went
straight to the morbid heart of the romance. In the love duet, his
finespun legato gave the passage repeated in the last act as
Isolde's transfiguration a calm, eerie bliss that few sopranos
could equal. The hero's delirium as he lies dying _ veering from
exhaustion to elation, punctuated by eruptions of searing anguish _
unfolded with spontaneity, immediacy and a remarkable palette of
apt timbres, now ashen, now aglow.
</P>
<P>
   It was a rich and deep performance. True, the Houston Symphony
Orchestra in the pit, conducted by Christoph Eschenbach, gave no
quarter, momentarily swamping Andersen here and there. Without
raising the specter of Melchior, one could cite living tenors who
roar louder. Sometimes their cries get lost, too. Andersen's
instrument held firm and steady to the end, and his identification
with the character never faltered.
</P>
<P>
   For an engrossing non-Wagnerian sample of Andersen's vocal and
interpretive gifts, seek out the recent Grammy-nominated recording
of Franz Schmidt's oratorio ``The Book With Seven Seals,'' on EMI,
in which he invests the awesome text of St. John the Divine with
apocalyptic dread and wonder.
</P>
<P>
   David Gockley, the general director of the Houston Grand Opera,
had long hoped to stage ``Tristan,'' he said. Only his discovery of
Andersen, in a Copenhagen ``Tannhauser,'' persuaded him to go
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has qualities seldom found in a heldentenor,'' Gockley
explained. ``The singing is lyrical, musical, always in control of
the pitch. The phrasing is sensitive. It's much more to my taste
than the Bayreuth bark. It's all part of a package. Onstage, he's a
credible human being. He thinks in terms of character, not just of
the singing voice.'' Volume is not everything.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Copenhagen barber and a nurse who later ran a home
for the elderly, Andersen grew up making music for fun. ``I'm old
enough to have had the luck to have a childhood without
television,'' he said with an impish grin, declining to give his
age.
</P>
<P>
   He studied in Copenhagen and Aarhus, and it was in Aarhus, in
1978, that he made his operatic debut, as the undetectable Don
Curzio in Mozart's ``Nozze di Figaro,'' soon graduating to the
melodious bel canto juveniles. With his engagement at the Royal
Opera in Copenhagen in 1980, he juggled roles like these against
such punishing grown-up fare as Canio, the sobbing clown of ``I
Pagliacci.'' Another purely lyric interlude ensued, lasting several
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   By now, Andersen has worked up roles extending from Mozart's
Tamino in ``The Magic Flute'' and Beethoven's Florestan in
``Fidelio'' to Verdi's Otello, Britten's outcast Peter Grimes and
the young Buddha in Per Norgard's ``Siddharta.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Still, Wagner's heroes hold a special place in his affections.
``I'm rare in that I sing them all at the same time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The note of pride is justified. Nowadays, the name-brand artists
most in demand prefer to take their Wagner a role or two at a time:
not necessarily an unwise policy. Unlike Handel, Mozart, the bel
canto composers and even Verdi on occasion, Wagner composed first
and cast later.
</P>
<P>
   His were the ``works of art of the future.'' He wrote, it has
been said, for artists yet unborn. More to the point, he conceived
each character as a total entity, the voice the mirror of a soul.
No two are alike.
</P>
<P>
   Siegfried, for instance, is nothing like Tristan. He enters the
``Ring'' as a child of the forest in his days of youthful glory. In
five of the most arduous hours in the tenor literature, he forges a
sword, slays a dragon and wins a sleeping beauty, who awakens in
highly vocal condition.
</P>
<P>
   The first act of ``Siegfried'' _ crushing in its orchestration,
relentless in its high, jubilant tessitura _ is a marathon in
itself. In Act III, the pressure mounts anew, with the competitive
love duet saved for last. In ``Gotterdammerung,'' treachery
(suffered and inflicted) is the order of the day, culminating in
Siegfried's murder. The hero's part begins much as it left off in
the previous opera but concludes in trancelike radiance, with tense
episodes along the way.
</P>
<P>
   Andersen has trod this road before, in Aarhus (before the
cameras of Danish television), in the Finnish capital and at the
Royal Albert Hall in London as well as at the Teatro Colon in
Buenos Aires, with a Met scout in attendance.
</P>
<P>
   The two Siegfrieds are among Andersen's favorite Wagnerian
leads, but then, he has trouble whittling his list down to as few
as five. The others are Siegmund (Siegfried's father, in ``Die
Walkure''), Tristan and Tannhauser, the poet torn between celestial
and carnal love.
</P>
<P>
   Not Parsifal? ``When I do `Parsifal,' I'm in heaven, but I feel
restrained,'' Andersen said. ``Act II is wonderful to sing, but in
Act III, I'm not sure I'm in an opera. I feel like it's an
oratorio. The characters aren't really theatrical.''
</P>
<P>
   And Lohengrin, the white knight? ``The part is wonderful to
sing, but he's in armor all the time,'' Andersen replied. ``I like
it more when a character is slightly crazy. I like as many colors
as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Singing, as Andersen conceives of the job, is an
all-encompassing affair. For the last 12 years, he has honed his
technique on his own, without the benefit of a voice teacher. ``But
not without advice,'' he instantly added. ``I'm married to an opera
singer, and if there are problems, we discuss them. If ever I am in
doubt, there's someone to trust completely. Singing is so complex.
If you concentrate on one aspect, it's easy to forget another.''
</P>
<P>
   Such as?
</P>
<P>
   ``If I concentrate on the placement of my voice, I might forget
the balance of my body. I sing with my knees bent, for a feeling of
complete balance. The hips must be brought forward, as if you were
riding a horse. With your feet, you must grab the ground the way a
monkey grabs a branch, like John Wayne, with his rolling walk.''
</P>
<P>
   He rose and demonstrated, with the same youthful pounce he
displays onstage: a great theatrical plus for characters far
younger, in general, than any artist ready to sing them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to be able to move instantly in any direction, to
express the particulars of a character with the body as well as the
voice,'' he added. ``Technically, the body and the voice are one
and the same. I'm very bad at vocalizing. I almost never sing
arpeggios. To warm up, I do bits of my parts. My wife does this,
too.''
</P>
<P>
   She is Tina Kiberg, whose light, fresh soprano resounded in
church music and Mozart to exquisite effect in 1987 on the
soundtrack of Gabriel Axel's film ``Babette's Feast.'' Like her
husband, she has moved on to heavier repertory.
</P>
<P>
   The list of operas in which one of them has appeared without the
other is not long. When Kiberg sang the dancing Judean princess of
Strauss's ``Salome,'' Andersen even looked on as her lust-crazed
stepfather, King Herod. Soon the couple will be reunited in
Copenhagen as the star-crossed lovers of Tchaikovsky's ``Queen of
Spades.''
</P>
<P>
   One stage on which they have not yet performed as a team is that
of Wagner's Festspielhaus in Bayreuth, a theater no more overrun
with heldentenor talent than any other. Kiberg has been called to
the shrine repeatedly, singing Sieglinde in ``Die Walkure'' and
Elisabeth in ``Tannhauser.'' Andersen has gone along with their two
daughters and his two sons from a previous marriage, a company
spouse.
</P>
<P>
   Does he dream of singing in the house Wagner built?
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know anybody who sings Wagner who doesn't want to
try,'' he replied.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there is the world. (af)

STOCK MARKETS SEEN AS UNCONTROLLABLE DUE TO SIZE AND VOLATILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also MARKET, STOCKS-MARKETPLACE and MARKET-GREENSPAN) 
 By ALEX BERENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At high noon Tuesday, after a rocky morning, stocks
pitched into a 90-minute freefall. By the time the dive ended,
shares in some of the market's biggest and most important
companies, from Internet leaders like Yahoo to corporate titans
like General Electric, had fallen 5, 10 or even 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There was no news bulletin to explain the decline, no mad rumor
of presidential ill health or war in Asia, only a tidal wave of
selling. Then, just as quickly, the market turned, and many stocks
finished the day close to where they began or even up slightly.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened?
</P>
<P>
   What happened, said professional traders said as the dust
settled Wednesday, is that the U.S. stock markets have become
bigger, more volatile, and more uncontrollable than ever before.
Even the billions of dollars that Wall Street firms put up to
``make markets'' _ to buy and sell stocks from individual investors
and mutual funds _ is no longer enough money to significantly slow
the moves in companies like Microsoft and Intel, which are valued
at well over $400 billion each.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the commissions paid by individual investors to trade
shares have dropped, leading to more trading than ever before and
adding to the volatility on days like Tuesday. Billions of shares
worth hundreds of billions of dollars now routinely change hands
every day on both the Nasdaq stock market and the New York Stock
Exchange, the two primary U.S. markets. On Tuesday, investors
traded a total of more than 4 billion shares on the Nasdaq and the
Big Board, topping the previous record by almost 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market caps have never been this big, and the volumes have
never been this high or this concentrated.'' said Mike Molnar,
managing director of equity sales and trading for Salomon Smith
Barney. As a result, securities firms that try to stand against a
large market move by buying shares run the risk of quickly losing
tens of millions of dollars, Molnar said. The moves ``are dwarfing
the amount of capital that any one firm could reasonably be
expected to commit to any given name.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Ketchum, president of the National Association of
Securities Dealers, which owns the Nasdaq, offered a blunter
assessment. ``No market, whether it's the New York Stock Exchange
or us, requires its market makers to commit suicide'' by trying to
prop up a plunging market, Ketchum said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that there have been significant changes
in the markets over the last few years,'' Ketchum said. ``The
amount of trading that comes in that dealers have to execute
against is much greater than it used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The conventional wisdom is that individual investors panic more
quickly than institutions. But Laszlo Birinyi, who runs a stock
market research firm in Westport, Conn., said that both large and
small investors were quick to look for the exits Tuesday. ``When
you look at the size of the trades, there were a lot of large
institutional trades,'' Birinyi said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the 18-year-old bull market may have entered a
perilous new phase. For if the Nasdaq composite index can fall by
13 percent, as it did Tuesday, on a day with little news, how much
might it drop on a day an earthquake shakes Silicon Valley?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the end, investors have to understand that if everybody
wants to go out the door at the same time, you can't get there,''
Ketchum said. ``There is only so much liquidity in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Wall Street firms risk only a small portion of their
capital to keep markets orderly, a comparison of their capital
growth to that of the overall market shows just how outgunned they
have become. In 1987, firms had $25 billion in equity capital,
according to the Securities Industry Association, a trade group. At
the time, that equaled about 1 percent of the total value of U.S.
stocks, which was $2.54 trillion, according to data from Birinyi's
firm.
</P>
<P>
   By 1999, the equity capital of Wall Street firms had almost
tripled, to $71 billion. But the total value of U.S. stocks had
risen sevenfold, to a whopping $17.4 trillion. As a result, the
ratio of securities firms' capital to the total value of U.S.
stocks had shrunk to barely 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the role of market maker in Nasdaq stocks has
generally become less profitable for securities firms, because of
lower commissions and smaller ``spreads,'' or markups between the
prices paid by buyers and to sellers, on stocks. Those changes have
led some securities firms to retreat from market making in smaller
stocks in particular.
</P>
<P>
   Their place has been taken, at least in part, by ``electronic
communications networks'' which attempt to match buyers and sellers
directly. When there are lots of investors making bids for and
offers of stock, the new networks are generally considered a plus
for investors, because they cut trading costs. But if the markets
suddenly turn down, ECNs cannot slow their slide, because they do
not put up any of their own capital to help match buyers and
sellers.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Nasdaq stocks are swinging more wildly than ever
before. Big companies like Yahoo and JDS Uniphase, with market caps
of close to $100 billion, fell 15 percent or more in minutes on
Tuesday, while some smaller companies recorded 25 and 35 percent
declines before recovering.
</P>
<P>
   The volatility was not quite as severe on the New York Stock
Exchange, which funnels all trades in a particular stock through a
single market maker called a ``specialist,'' who has responsibility
for matching buyers and sellers. But the most heavily traded stocks
are on the Nasdaq, not the Big Board, making the New York's
argument that its system is superior hard to prove. Like the
Nasdaq's market makers, the Big Board's specialists do not have
enough capital to oppose major market moves, traders said. The
Nasdaq and the New York ``are closer together than they have ever
been before,'' said Ken Sheinberg, head of listed trading for SG
Cowen.
</P>
<P>
   The increased volatility is unlikely to abate soon, said Molnar
of Salomon Smith Barney. But over time, market makers and traders
will find new ways to profit from the wild swings in price, he
said. And those new strategies will almost certainly moderate the
swings, since they will probably involve buying on the dips. Until
then, investors can only hope the ride does not get too bouncy.

 &HT;    Gore in Florida for fund-raiser
 &HT;    By Brian E. Crowley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Vice President Al Gore will be at the home of
attorney Bob Montgomery tonight for a $10,000-per-person dinner.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, Gore travels to Old School Square in Delray Beach,
where he will meet with voters and talk about Medicare and his plan
to make it easier to get prescription drugs.
</P>
<P>
   At the meeting, with an invited crowd of about 150, Gore also is
expected to talk about the Democratic Party platform and a plan to
allow people to send suggestions about changing the party platform
over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic National Committee has formed a partnership with
Speakout.Com, a Web site that helps people find out about issues
and contact their elected officials. Gore and the DNC plan to use
Speakout.Com to allow people to read the party platform and make
comments.
</P>
<P>
   After the morning meeting at Old School Square, Gore will travel
to the Broward County home of U.S. Rep. Peter Deutsch, where he
will attend a $5,000-a-person lunch with about 85 people.
</P>
<P>
   The more than $1 million expected to be raised from the dinner
and lunch is going to the Democratic National Committee. That money
will be used to help elect Democratic candidates, including Gore,
who is challenging Texas Gov. George W. Bush for the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   After lunch, Gore is scheduled to travel to Tampa, where he will
go to an after-school program, meet with children and teachers and
talk about education.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is tentatively scheduled to return to West Palm Beach on
Monday to raise more money for the Democratic Party. For in-depth

 &HT;    Makers of brand-name drugs can make millions
 &HT;    By Mary Ellen Klas
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLAHASSEE, Fla. _ Thirteen-year-old Carolyn Ruben of Stuart
lives daily on the edge. Her rare heart condition makes her
dependent on a host of medications which, if not managed properly,
could kill her.
</P>
<P>
   Her situation is so delicate, her father traveled to Tallahassee
on Wednesday to plead with legislators not to pass a bill before
the Senate to allow six pharmaceutical drugs, including the blood
thinner his daughter depends on, to be replaced by a generic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not need one more factor that will complicate our
efforts to give Carolyn the care that she both needs and
deserves,'' said her father, Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   If her medication were changed from the name brand Coumadin to
the generic warfarin and that causes her blood to fluctuate, he
said, her doctors ``should not have to wonder whether her
medication has been switched.''
</P>
<P>
   Pharmacists are required to indicate on the label when a generic
drug is substituted, but patients may not always read the labels.
</P>
<P>
   There is more at stake here than Carolyn's condition. About a
dozen name-brand drug manufacturers have reaped millions of dollars
because they have been been protected for decades in Florida from
competition from cheaper generic equivilents.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal before the Senate, which has been one of the most
heavily lobbied bills of the session, allows a lower-priced generic
drug to be substituted for four name-brand drugs because the
federal Food and Drug Administration has determined them to be
``bioequivalent.''
</P>
<P>
   State law now prohibits 11 name brand drugs from being
substituted unless a doctor orders otherwise because of fears that
even a slight fluctuation in the composition of the drugs could
have a deterimental effect on patients.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents of the change, mostly makers of the generic drugs,
argue that officials in 46 other states, where generic
substitutions are allowed, have reported that the switch is safe.
</P>
<P>
   They claim that the medical profession in Florida has been
heavily saturated with scare stories about the variabilitiy of the
drugs at symposiums and educational seminars paid for by the large
drug manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
   One drug maker, Barr Laboratories _ which makes warfarin _
recently obtained letters from the deans of the colleges of
pharmacy at the University of Florida and Florida A&AMP;M that say
warfarin can be safely substituted for Coumadin.
</P>
<P>
   Barr said it has not given money to the schools.
</P>
<P>
   Under an amendment proposed by Sen. Ron Klein (D-West Palm
Beach), four generic drugs could be substituted for Coumadin,
Dilantin, Quinaglute and Slo-Bid beginning July 1. After that,
Florida's boards of medicine and pharmacy would report to the
legislature whether any of those drugs, and the seven other generic
drugs not on Klein's list, should remain on the list of restricted
generics, known as the ``negative formulary'' list.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was scheduled for debate Tuesday but was later
postponed after some opponents said they were not prepared. Senate
leaders said they were confident the bill will pass, regardless of
the postponed debate.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the House has postponed all efforts to raise this
issue. House leaders oppose it and barring the governor's
intervention, it may be dead there.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben said he came to Tallahassee as a man concerned not only
for his daughter, but also for his wife, Patricia, who takes an
asthma drug on the protected list. ``Nobody paid me to be here,''
he said. ``I came to try to protect those who I love most from a
profit-motivated scam that could endanger the health and safety of
Carolyn, Patricia and thousands of Floridians who endure similar
hardships.''

BOTH PARTIES WOO A RENEGADE OHIO DEMOCRAT
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, Va, Texas)  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Leaders of both parties are wooing Rep. James
Traficant Jr., a blustery former sheriff who is, by his own
admission, about to be indicted and who over the years has been
scorned by his colleagues as often as he has been courted.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, with Republican support, Traficant, a Democrat, won
the first legislative round in his effort to get a $35 million
grant for Youngstown, Ohio, the main city in his district.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant often sides with Republicans, and he has said that if
he is re-elected, he might actually vote with Republicans to elect
their candidate as speaker. That vote would amount to switching
parties and that could be critical, given the uncertainty over
which party will be in the majority.
</P>
<P>
   The majority party, even if it has a majority of just one,
controls the legislative agenda, all the committees and most of the
staff positions. The balance between Republicans and Democrats is
so close that if Democrats gain a net of six seats from the
election in November, they would be in control.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the House Rules Committee, which is effectively an
arm of the current Republican leadership, agreed to allow a vote on
Thursday by the full House on Traficant's proposal to give
Youngstown $35 million for a new community center as part of a
broad, bipartisan housing bill. The House is expected to approve
the proposed amendment.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual, though not unheard of, for the Republicans to
champion this kind of pork-barrel project in a Democratic district.
When they were asked how it came about this time, lawmakers, who
often treat Traficant as something of a misfit, answered with
winks, nods and smiles.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David Dreier, R-Calif., who is chairman of the Rules
Committee, said: ``Traficant is someone we've looked to for
support, and he has often helped us when we've needed a vote. We
look kindly on someone like that.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Congressional Quarterly, Traficant sided with
Republicans 57 percent of the time in 1999 on votes when most
Republicans voted one way and most Democrats the other. Only two
other representatives broke party ranks more often: Virgil Goode
Jr. of Virginia, who left the Democratic Party this year and became
an independent, and Ralph Hall, D-Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant was sheriff of Mahoning County before he was elected
to Congress in 1984. While he was sheriff, he was accused of
accepting money from a mobster after federal agents videotaped a
meeting between the two. In his trial, he testified that he was
conducting a sting operation when he took the money, and he was
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In his primary campaign this year, Traficant acknowledged that
he expected to be indicted again this year as part of a grand jury
investigation into corruption in Youngstown. He proclaimed his
innocence and won the primary anyway last month with more than 50
percent of the vote in a three-way race.
</P>
<P>
   He has said he suspected that the national Democratic Party
worked against him in the primary and has threatened to bolt the
party as a consequence.
</P>
<P>
   If he learns for sure that the Democratic leaders did try to
purge him, Traficant said in an interview last month on C-Span,
``it will be the biggest mistake they ever made.''
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a 50-50 chance he would vote for Republicans
to control the House next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Rick Lazio, R-N.Y., who is chairman of the housing
subcommittee of the Banking Committee, grinned broadly when he was
asked how the proposal for the grant to Youngstown had won so much
support. `` Mr. Traficant made a good case for it,'' he declared.
Lazio's subcommittee has jurisdiction over the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Nichols, the spokeswoman for Rep. Richard Gephardt of
Missouri, the Democratic leader, said she understood some Democrats
in the House were opposed to the grant but that the Democratic
leadership was behind it.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John LaFalce of Buffalo, the top Democrat on the Banking
Committee, also broke into a grin when he was questioned. ``I don't
want to oppose it at this juncture,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Traficant would not comment. ``I never discuss pending
legislation,'' he said when he was confronted outside the House
chamber this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   If the House approves the grant, it would be only the first step
in a long legislative process. Not only would the grant need to win
support in the Senate, but the money would also have to be included
in the appropriations legislation that determines what money is
actually spent.
</P>
<P>
   The only outspoken opponent of the Traficant grant is Rep.
Barney Frank of Massachusetts, a senior Democrat on the Banking
Committee. ``It's a zero-sum game,'' Frank said. ``The $35 million
comes out of someone else's pocket.''
</P>
<P>
   By Frank's account, Traficant's price more than doubled in the
last two weeks. Frank said he was first approached about supporting
a $15 million grant. He said he declined and thought that was the
end of it. But on Friday, he said, he was told the amendment would
now cost $35 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to come from the Republican leadership,'' Frank
said, ``but I got the impression the Democratic leadership wanted
me to go along.''

   An Argentine court ordered the extradition of two Paraguayans
accused in the assassination of Vice President Luis Maria Argana of
Paraguay last year. The men, arrested in January, were named by a

 &HT;    Echoes of glory
 &HT;    By Kirk Bohls
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ His approach shot on No. 9 carried the hole and
instantly spun backward like a yo-yo on a string. The ball headed
toward that menacing slope in front of the green that serves as
golf's version of a boomerang.
</P>
<P>
   But instead of returning from whence it came, the ball took dead
aim toward the cup, lipping out at the last second and stopping
only a foot away for an easy birdie.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery cheered wildly, appreciative of the excellent shot
and oblivious to the fact that this was only a Wednesday practice
round, just a prelude to the real thing that begins in earnest
today.
</P>
<P>
   But they cheered just the same. As they always have for Ben
Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The roars of the gallery aren't as frequent as they once were
for Austin, Texas', own, but the embrace with which golf fans hold
the two-time Masters winner remains as warm and firm and genuine as
ever.
</P>
<P>
   No man holds as dear the vivid memories of this prestigious
tournament as the slender, affable, 48-year-old Texan. No
professional athlete has ever been classier or more accommodating
with the press. And no one knows better than Crenshaw that twilight
has caught up with his career. He recognizes it as well with the
barest of lament, but then he's had more moments in the bright
Georgia sun than most and will soon play on the Senior Tour.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-eight times, he has come to this tiny, scenic community
that clings to the state's eastern border, and on 18 of those
occasions, he has finished in the top 25. He's been in the top 10
an amazing 11 times and finished among the top three in six
Masters. It's never been a course that terrifically suited
Crenshaw's game. He has never been long off the tee or particularly
straight, but his ability to scramble, to imagine, to create on a
tract of land that demands it were virtually unmatched. And it
didn't hurt that he was one of the best putters the game has ever
known.
</P>
<P>
   But those are times gone by.
</P>
<P>
   He has missed the cut in his last two trips to Augusta and
hadn't played on the weekend here three of the last four years.
Sadly, that's been the state of his game overall for some time. He
lunges at the ball now instead of smoothly stroking it toward the
hole.
</P>
<P>
   Consequently, he has missed the cut in 22 consecutive
tournaments and not survived one since the Buick Classic in June
1998 when he tied for 63rd and cashed a check for $11,393.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he's received more notoriety lately for his wife
Julie's sexy pose alongside her fully clothed husband in Sports
Illustrated's annual swimsuit issue than for anything he's done on
a golf course.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd love to have a good tournament this week,'' Crenshaw said
softly, almost in a whisper under the sprawling, thick 150-year-old
oak tree set behind the storied Augusta National clubhouse. ``But I
haven't had a good tournament in so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The last good tournament he had a hand in wasn't even a
tournament, not in the conventional sense. Last September, Crenshaw
captained the U.S. team that stormed from behind on the final day
at the Country Club in Brookline, Mass., to win 8 1/2 points in the
biggest comeback in the event's history to dramatically recapture
the Ryder Cup. The two-year obsession with every last detail of
that competition from the matching player uniforms to the team
dinners physically and mentally drained Crenshaw and ultimately
consumed a man who's so sentimental he almost tears up over a
sunset. Underneath the photo in the family Christmas card he and
Julie mailed out were the words ``Our Cup runneth over ...''
</P>
<P>
   To this day, Crenshaw is besieged with positive response from
the Ryder Cup. ``It's nice,'' he said in his understated way.
</P>
<P>
   As he came off the course Wednesday, one woman approached him
and shouted into his ear, ``You made me proud to be an American.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.'' A small boy posed for a snapshot
with Ben. Others clamored for him, calling his name, yelling out
encouragement, just wanting to slap him on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The well wishes and tributes continue to overwhelm the highly
emotional Crenshaw, whose declaration on the eve of the Ryder Cup
comeback that he had a ``good feeling'' about the next day proved
him a prophet. Unfortunately, he cannot predict his next successful
round of golf as a player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to go out and play well,'' said Crenshaw, who has
played in only four Tour events this year and has yet to break par
in any round. ``I feel capable at times, but a few holes derail me.
I'll play good at times, then I'll have a squirrelly hole, and it
stops me. I'm slowing down.''
</P>
<P>
   For now, his days are as consumed by devotion to his three
daughters and attention to the new Austin Golf Club he co-designed
with Bill Coor west of the city that may open this fall. Where once
he derived his greatest pleasure from one of his 19 Tour victories
that brought him $7 million in career earnings, now he measures
happiness in watching 12-year-old Katherine Vail play softball and
7-year-old Claire Susan go through a gym practice or dance routine
and bouncing 2-year-old Anna Riley on his knee. The simple
pleasures are always the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoy just getting up with them,'' Ben said, ``and putting
them to bed.''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Crenshaw would like to play better, like to be in a
contending position this week and have that Gentle Ben blade in his
hands, needing to sink a 20-footer on 18 to win. But he doesn't
need to. His life is fulfilled, his legacy assured. And if his last
golf championship on the PGA Tour is the improbable 1995 Masters
that he won just five days after burying his beloved golf
instructor, Harvey Penick, then he can think of no better way to go
out.

GTE WEB UNIT TO HIRE 500 E-COMMERCE SPECIALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GTE Internetworking plans to hire 500 e-commerce consultants and
engineers in Massachusetts this year to help develop its high-speed
data network and offer services as part of a proposed spinout from
GTE Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The division, with headquarters in Burlington, Mass., also plans
to announce that it will change its name to Genuity Inc. as it
becomes a publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
   The plan is part of a controversial bid by GTE and Bell Atlantic
to gain government approvals for their $84 billion merger plan,
which would create the country's biggest local phone company.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the GTE unit employs about 2,000 people in
Massachusetts and 3,500 in all. It includes most of the assets of
the former Bolt Beranek &AMP; Newman in Cambridge, which GTE bought in
1997 for $616 million. GTE says the unit had revenue of about $1
billion last year but wasn't profitable.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, Bolt Beranek was one of the Pentagon's first
contractors for the computer system that became the Internet. More
recently, the company has operated high-speed data connections for
big corporation and Internet service providers. In February, it won
a contract from America Online Inc., estimated to be worth more
than $2.5 billion, to install new connections for the service
provider.
</P>
<P>
   If the Genuity spinout is approved, GTE Internetworking's
president Paul R. Gudonis said, the company would become one of the
top four providers of Internet connectivity services along with
Sprint, WorldCom and UUNet. To compete, Gudonis said Genuity will
offer more consulting services to help companies create corporate
Internets and business-to-business services for e-commerce. Gudonis
would be head of the new company.
</P>
<P>
   The future of the division remains a touchy issue before
regulators, however. In filings with the Federal Communications
Commission, GTE and Bell Atlantic had proposed to spinoff the unit
as a public company and keep a 10 percent ownership interest, with
an option to increase that to 80 percent within five years.
</P>
<P>
   But competitor AT&AMP;T says that would leave those companies
effectively in control of the unit. AT&AMP;T wants the FCC to insist
Bell Atlantic make more commitments to open local phone service to
competition.
</P>
<P>
   The FCC is considering the arguments and hopes to rule on the
merger by July.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Kovar, a manager at the Yankee Group consulting firm who
follows the networking industry, said Genuity would be free as a
stand-alone company to pursue a more aggressive strategy than it
would be as a local phone company unit. ``It's not a change to the
entire business model,'' he said of Genuity's plans. ``But maybe
these are things they felt they weren't free to do, or weren't able
to do, because of the lethargic Bell operating company mentality.''
</P>
<P>
   Gudonis said he couldn't discuss financial specifics, including
the total amount of networking investment Genuity would make, until
the company files registration statements with the Securities and
Exchange Commission to sell public shares. No filings are expected
until the FCC clears the merger of the parent companies, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gudonis's tenure with the GTE unit dates back to 1994, when he
joined Bolt Beranak as president of what then was known as its
``BBN Planet'' division, providing high-speed data services to
individual companies. The business totalled about $5 million that
year, he said; now it will generate the majority of Genuity's
revenue. In addition to Internet companies, customers include
Honeywell and FleetBoston Financial Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Genuity also will invest heavily to upgrade its Internet
backbone services so it can eventually handle the heavy demands
needed to send video signals to homes via cable modems and
high-speed phone lines. Clients for these services include Yahoo
Inc. and General Electric's NBC Interactive, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The unit is also constructing a new office park in Woburn.
Gudonis said will house 1,400 people by next year, some of whom
transferred from other offices in the state.

 &HT;    Opening-leg losses put Barcelona, Lazio in bind
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The four main contenders for the European Champions
League have some hefty work to do when they return home for the
second leg of quarterfinal play in two weeks' time. But Barcelona
and Lazio, considered two of the best clubs on the continent this
season, may soon be eliminated thanks to two disastrous opening-leg
results this week.
</P>
<P>
   Valencia, missing two key starters, smashed Lazio 5-2 on the
Spanish coast on Wednesday, getting a hat trick from Gerard. The
Italian club can advance in Rome on April 19 by a minimum 3-0
score, which won't be easy.
</P>
<P>
   Barcelona's task is not much easier, as Chelsea dominated in a
3-1 victory. The Spanish champions were the victims of a three-goal
blitz by the Londoners during an eight-minute stretch in the first
half, as Gianfranco Zola opened with a free-kick strike and Tore
Andre Flo scored twice on quick counterattacks. Luis Figo got the
away goal in the second half for Barca.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, defending champion Manchester United drew 0-0 at
Real Madrid as goalkeeper Mark Bosnich made a series of dramatic
saves. Bayern Munich needed an 80th-minute goal from Paulo Sergio
to pull even with Porto 1-1.
</P>
<P>
   In today's first leg of the UEFA Cup semifinals, two English
clubs are favored. Arsenal plays host to former French champion
Lens, while Leeds visits Istanbul club Galatasaray.
</P>
<P>
   LATIN: EL SALVADOR WINS
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay Mutiny striker Raul Diaz Arce scored on a header in
the 50th minute for the only goal of the game, and traveling El
Salvador defeated bitter rival Guatemala 1-0 Sunday in a World Cup
qualifying match. . . . A penalty kick by Julio Dely Valdes lifted
Panama to a 1-0 win over Honduras. . . . In South American
qualifying, a penalty kick from Newcastle's Nolberto Solano was all
Peru needed in a 2-0 upset of Paraguay in its opening qualifier. .
. . Two goals by Juan Sebastian Veron and single tallies from
Gabriel Batistuta and Claudio Lopez helped Argentina crush Chile
4-1. ENGLAND: VILLA REACHES FINAL
</P>
<P>
   A penalty kick by Dion Dublin and two clutch saves by David
James propelled Aston Villa to its first FA Cup final in 43 years.
The Birmingham club ousted Bolton 4-1 Sunday after a scoreless
draw. In the finals on May 20 at Wembley, Villa will play either
Chelsea or Newcastle, which meet Sunday in the other semifinal. . .
. The only suspense left in the Premier League is which two teams
will join Manchester United in next year's Champions League.
Liverpool moved to within a point of second-place Leeds by getting
two goals from Michael Owen and beating Coventry City 3-0. John
Harley's second-half goal lifted Chelsea to a 1-0 win over Leeds,
which has lost three in a row. Chelsea and Arsenal are also in
striking range.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: LEVERKUSEN LEADS
</P>
<P>
   Bayer Leverkusen's ambition of winning its first Bundlesiga
title moved a step closer to reality Saturday with a 2-1 win over
1860 Munich to take over the league's top spot. Second-half goals
by Ulf Kirsten and Markus Schroth pushed Bayer to 57 points, two
ahead of Bayern Munich, which drew Wolfsburg 1-1 and lost the lead
for the first time since Oct. 2.
</P>
<P>
   ITALY: LAZIO MAKES IT A RACE
</P>
<P>
   Less than a minute after Juventus defender Ciro Ferrara was
red-carded for a hard tackle, Lazio's Diego Simeone responded with
a scoring header midway in the second half Sunday. Lazio won 1-0 on
the road to cut the Turin club's Serie A lead to three points.
SPAIN: ATLETICO `BANKRUPT'
</P>
<P>
   The on-the-field problems for Atletico Madrid _ second from the
bottom in the Primera and facing relegation for the first time in
67 years _ are bad enough. But an accountant charged with examining
the club's woeful books this week declared it ``technically
bankrupt.'' Atletico, winless in its past nine matches, is roughly
$75 million in debt. Club president Jesus Gil y Gil has been
suspended because of financial irregularities that have led to
government charges against him.
</P>
<P>
   EUROPE: MARSEILLE IN DANGER
</P>
<P>
   The last time Olympique Marseille was relegated, in the
mid-1990s, it was the result of a match-fixing scandal. Now, the
French club with the most passionate following could be making the
drop without the smell of corruption. Its fate could be sealed
Saturday when it plays host to AS Monaco, which has a 13-point lead
in Le Championnat. Marseille, a preseason title favorite, is in
13th place, a point out of relegation. . . . Sporting Lisbon,
seeking its first Portuguese first-division title in 18 years,
stretched its lead over Porto to four points with a 1-0 win over
Belenenses.

 &HT;    Olympic course awes 8th-grader
 &HT;    By Kent Mitchell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When 8-year-old Eric Hurd saw paddlers battling the
Ocoee River's roaring whitewater during the Olympic trials in 1995,
he said to his father, ``I wonder if I'll ever paddle on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Five years later, Hurd will be the youngest kayak competitor
among 125 hopefuls in the Olympic canoe/kayak slalom team trials
this weekend on the Ocoee.
</P>
<P>
   The Woodstock Middle School eighth-grader is one of six paddlers
in the trials who have received support from the U.S. Olympic
Committee's Community Development Program. The program distributes
money left over from the Atlanta Olympics to smaller sports such as
kayaking to help pay for equipment and coaching.
</P>
<P>
   Hurd said his return to the Ocoee ``is awesome.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1995, I'd just started to paddle, and now I'm actually
racing in it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hurd, Eric's father, was an elite kayaker but left the
sport by 1980, so his son didn't grow up on the water. It was only
after Eric saw old 8-millimeter films of his father competing that
he got interested.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he got interested, I got interested again,'' said Mike
Hurd, 48.
</P>
<P>
   They started with an old broken kayak. Once Mike saw his son's
talent, they each got new kayaks.
</P>
<P>
   Eric soon moved to the Atlanta Center for Excellence and coach
Mike Larimer.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hurd said Eric's strong points are his ability to read the
water and his strength-to-weight ratio. He can move his 4 feet, 9
inches and 100 pounds through the water better than most older,
stronger paddlers. Coaching did the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``With as much talent as Eric has, Mike (Larimer) is responsible
for his climb,'' Mike Hurd said.
</P>
<P>
   Eric earned a spot in the trials with a fourth-place finish at a
national qualifying meet on the Nantahala River in North Carolina.
Larimer is hoping for a top-20 finish this weekend, Mike Hurd said.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Eric wins, he can't go to Sydney. ``I'm too young,'' he
said. ``You have to be 18.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ The new-economy stocks may be battered, but they
aren't dead.
</P>
<P>
   The high-technology companies led the market down in the rout
that ended about 1:15 p.m. on Tuesday, but many of those same
stocks turned around and led the market back up in the next day and
a half.
</P>
<P>
   No group of stocks better represented the stars of Nasdaq's rise
_ a gain that saw the Nasdaq composite index double from last
summer to its peak early this month _ than 1999's best performing
initial public offerings. A total of 23 new stocks ended the year
trading at least 10 times their original offering price _ a
performance almost unheard of until the last couple of years, when
public enthusiasm soared.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly all of the 1999 class of very hot deals were Internet
related, and nearly all of them have no profits. They trade on
hopes and expectations to the extent they reflect fundamentals at
all, and they have been highly popular with momentum investors who
pay more attention to price movements than to financial statements.
</P>
<P>
   The group has performed horribly since the Nasdaq market peaked
on March 10. Since then, the Nasdaq composite is down 17.4 percent,
while the best performing of last year's new stars, Brocade
Communications, is down 18.9 percent. On average, the group has
lost 48 percent of its value in just 18 trading sessions. Anyone
who got in near the top has good reason to moan.
</P>
<P>
   But the figures were far worse before the revival. Measured from
Tuesday's lows, these stocks were up 33.9 percent by the close of
trading Wednesday, more than twice the 14.3 percent recovery of the
overall Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   After selling ended Tuesday, there was a lot of talk that
traditional valuation measures would once more come to the fore,
and that the amazingly optimistic valuations that had characterized
the market in recent months would fade away.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that will still happen. But the revival of those stocks
_ including some that had fallen out of favor in early 2000, before
the Nasdaq market began to fall _ shows that the investors who bid
up their prices with enthusiasm are still in the market, and many
see the latest market slide as merely being the most recent in a
series of buying opportunities dating back to the 1987 crash. In
each of those declines the eventual profits went to those who
bought, not to those who panicked and sold. That may change one of
these days, but many do not believe it has happened yet.
</P>
<P>
   The recent fall has been far more rapid than most declines since
1987. It stems in part from the sharp rise in margin borrowing by
speculators. The lows reached on Wednesday morning, when the Nasdaq
composite briefly traded down 3 percent from Tuesday's close,
probably reflected forced selling of positions by brokerage firms
whose customers had not come up with the cash needed to prevent
liquidation of some or all of their positions.
</P>
<P>
   But after that selling was done, prices in the Nasdaq market
broadly recovered, and buying was again concentrated in many of the
previous favorites.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 23 hot new issues of 1999, all are still trading at
prices well above the initial offering prices. But most of them
have declined so far in 2000, by an average of 22.2 percent even as
the Nasdaq composite has risen 2.5 percent. Still, seven of the 23
are ahead in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   It may be no coincidence that the worst performer of the hot 23
in the last day and a half is also the only one that has virtually
no happy public shareholders. Akamai Technologies, whose software
speeds the delivery of Internet pages, went public at $26 a share
in October and ended the first day of trading above $145. The low
trade that day was $110, which happens to be the price at which the
stock closed at on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It is still up 323 percent from its offering price, but there is
not a shareholder who bought in the public markets who has a
profit, save for any who bought near the lows Tuesday or yesterday.
Unlike many similar stocks, it has not served momentum investors
well.
</P>
<P>
   Akamai is also one of the stocks whose lockup period for
investors who owned shares before it went public is about to
expire. On Monday, the Securities and Exchange Commission received
13 filings from those investors stating that they planned to make
such sales.

 &HT;    Franks catching scouts' attention
 &HT;    By Mark Schlabach
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Miami tight end Daniel Franks was a toddler, he
earned the nickname ``Bubba'' because that's what he called his
bottle.
</P>
<P>
   Now, NFL scouts are the ones drooling for ``Bubba,'' a man-child
from Big Spring, Texas, who runs and catches like a receiver but
blocks like an offensive tackle.
</P>
<P>
   Franks, 6 feet 5 and 265 pounds, will be the first tight end
chosen in the draft. Before a somewhat disappointing workout last
month in Miami, it was thought he would become the highest-drafted
tight end since Southern California's Charle Young was picked sixth
by the Eagles in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Franks) is one of the top tight ends to come out of college
football in the last 10 years,'' said Gil Brandt, the Cowboys'
director of player personnel. ``When you start talking about the
next greatest tight end, this is the kid.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks left college after a junior season in which he had 45
catches for 565 yards and five touchdowns. In his final two seasons
with the Hurricanes, he often went in motion and worked out of the
slot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say I'm probably a tight end,'' Franks said. ``I am a
big receiver, but I can also block. Most people don't see that part
of a tight end. They just see me running down the field making
one-handed catches and stuff like that. But I try to take pride in
my blocking.''
</P>
<P>
   Franks, a two-time All-Big East selection, also was a Division I
basketball prospect, but he didn't know it. Franks said his high
school football coach hid the recruiting letters from him because
he knew that his star player's future was on the field.
</P>
<P>
   Franks said he realized it last season, when his former
roommate, Indianapolis Colts running back Edgerrin James, suggested
that it was time for Franks to play in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Edgerrin whispered in my ear that it would be my decision,''
Franks said. ``He felt it was probably time for me to come out, but
that was something I had to figure out myself.''
</P>
<P>
   After Franks had somewhat slow sprint times in the workout last
month, NFL scouts are wondering whether he is worthy of a top-10
pick. The Broncos, who have the 10th choice, didn't re-sign Pro
Bowl tight end Shannon Sharpe in the offseason. The Bears, who pick
eighth, use the position heavily in coordinator Gary Crowton's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like Bubba Franks,'' Bears coach Dick Jauron said.
``The tight-end position should explode in our offense. The numbers
should go way up, especially if the wide receivers come through the
way we expect.''

30 NORTHEASTERN FRESHMEN SUSPECTED OF CHEATING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ABEL  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ At least 30 Northeastern University freshmen, many of
them honor students, face cheating charges after discovering a
glitch in an Internet-based homework service program used by
college campuses nationwide that is supposed to prevent cheating,
university officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The students used WebAssign.net, which promises professors and
students a variety of other benefits, including immediate feedback,
reduced grading errors, more practice with difficult problems, and
the elimination of monotonous grading.
</P>
<P>
   But freshmen in an introductory physics class turned in
identical homework assignments even though the program is supposed
to give each student a different set of problems, said Nathan
Israeloff, an associate professor of the class.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is different than other cheating cases on the Internet,
in that the answers weren't available on the Web,'' said Israeloff.
``What they did is copy from other students. It's similar to
photocopying the answers or downloading directly off the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   In figuring out how to dupe WebAssign.net, a site used by more
than 200 high schools and colleges and about 40,000 people per day,
the Northeastern freshmen have forced the North Carolina State
University-based company to redesign its program, according to
WebAssign.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key thing is that it's no longer possible to do what the
students did,'' said Brian Pittman, WebAssign's senior programmer,
adding that the problem has occurred at one other university. ``The
whole thing has been closed up, and I have given all those students
zeros on the assignment.''
</P>
<P>
   Somehow, Israeloff and Pittman said, the students discovered
that entering the Web site numerous times on the same computer
would generate identical questions even if the students used
different passwords and user IDs.
</P>
<P>
   WebAssign was designed to avoid such a scenario. When students
in the same class log on, they are supposed to receive individually
tailored homework assignments. In addition to making it easier for
professors to grade the assignments, it is also supposed to prevent
students from sharing questions and answers.
</P>
<P>
   But apparently once freshmen in ``Physics for Scientists and
Engineers'' learned their way around the system, the word spread
and others decided to ditch learning how to solve gravity and
oscillation equations for a few clicks of a computer mouse.
</P>
<P>
   Several students have turned themselves in, Israeloff said, and
others may be innocent if they can prove their actions were a
mistake or another student stole their answers.
</P>
<P>
   At least one freshman was willing to admit his dishonesty:
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't understand how to do the assignment,'' said a
computer engineering major who asked not to be named. ``I asked a
guy for help and he said he didn't have the time, but he said he
would let me use his answers. I regret not just being caught. I
came out of the class not knowing how to use the program, and it's
something I'm going to have to learn.''
</P>
<P>
   The penalties, university officials say, range from probation if
it is a first offense to expulsion if it is a second offense.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Internet and computers to cheat is an increasing
phenomenon plaguing professors around the country. At Northeastern,
during the past winter term, five students were put on disciplinary
probation for copying each other's computer code, school officials
said. Last month, 78 students at Dartmouth College were exonerated
after their computer science professor accused them of filching
answers to a homework assignment off a class Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Northeastern officials downplayed any notion that the school has
a unique cheating problem, saying that it has an average of about
12 such cheating cases a year out of a population of 12,000
students.
</P>
<P>
   And as clear as what the freshmen in the introductory physics
class are accused of is wrong, Richard Scranton, Northeastern's
associate dean of engineering, said the more important thing is
that students learn from their mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to remember that freshmen are students in
transition from high school to college, coming from a
parent-supervised life to one where they make their own
decisions,'' he said. ``Students have to learn how to do that. They
have to learn that there are consequences to bad decisions. They
have to understand ethical responsibility.''

MIAMI-AREA LATINOS DIVIDED ON ELIAN ISSUE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By ARMANDO VILLAFRANCA 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MIAMI _ While the American public is fed televised images of
Cuban-Americans storming barricades and shouting anti-American
epithets aimed at U.S. leaders, Latinos have differing perspectives
on how the Cuban exile community has responded to the plight of
6-year-old shipwreck survivor Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Cuban-Americans who share the protesters' anti-Castro sentiment
believe the community as a whole is being unfairly portrayed. Other
Latinos, however, believe the exile community has gone too far and
has used the boy as a conduit to vent its long-standing hatred for
Cuban President Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the press wants to show us in a bad light,'' said Dell
Godvina, 38, who was born in Cuba, grew up in Little Havana and now
lives in Kendall, south of Miami. ``They show scenes of people
rushing the gates, and that's what people want to see. They don't
want to see professional Cubans sitting behind a desk. What they
want to see is Miami burning, they would love to see us burn, but I
don't think they're going to see that.''
</P>
<P>
   Jose Andres Ulloa, a 23-year-old native of Ecuador, who believes
``sangre es sangre'' (blood is blood) and that Elian belongs with
his father, said any claim on behalf of the boy's best interest has
been tainted by the daily spectacle outside his Little Havana home.
</P>
<P>
   There, hundreds of exile demonstrators spew verbal attacks
against Castro, U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The Cuban-American demonstrators, he said, ``grab on to anything
to try to make a big deal out of Castro. That's their way of
fighting back, sort of like wanting Castro to leave, but I really
don't think they're going to get anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of public opinion, Americans are getting their fill
of a Miami not often seen _ a city seemingly dominated by its
Cuban-American community whose political clout compels
Cuban-American officeholders to boldly challenge the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
   Jeanne Sullivan, spokeswoman for the Greater Miami Convention
and Visitors Bureau, said the issue has not affected the city's
tourism industry, which just ended its high season, running from
December to March. She also said the controversy has been isolated
to a small section of the city.

   ``We're 2,000 square miles, and we're business as usual,'' she
said. ``The average American person is educated enough to realize
that this kind of controversy happens everywhere in America and
that the actions of one segment of the community do not reflect the
whole of the community.''
</P>
<P>
   However, the storm surrounding the Elian case dominates the
daily letters-to-the-editor section of The Miami Herald, with most
critical of the Cuban exile community.
</P>
<P>
   John Hopkins of North Augusta, S.C., wrote recently: ``I once
considered Miami a good prospect for vacationing. No more. I never
could feel comfortable in a city that puts itself above the laws of
the country, humanity and God. Elian belongs with his father, not
with a great-uncle.''
</P>
<P>
   C.L. Conrad of Homestead, Fla., wrote, ``The Department of
Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service have been
swayed too long by threats of disruption from community members if
Elian is returned to Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   The threat of violent demonstrations is prevalent enough that
Miami City Manager Donald Warshaw toured the scene outside Elian's
home Wednesday to ensure calm prevailed and to downplay the
possibility of violent demonstrations.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, demonstrators took their protests to Reno's
Kendall home, where they held signs showing the attorney general
with devil's horns.
</P>
<P>
   Tomas Von Hertz, a 19-year-old native of Argentina, believes the
issue has been given ``more attention than was really needed and
now has been blown up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something simple, actually, and it's been turned into a
political matter,'' he said. ``It's a simple thing, really. The boy
belongs in Cuba. He should be back in Cuba, not only in Cuba, but
back with his father. It's good that they say what they feel is
wrong, but they shouldn't have the power to keep the boy here when
he belongs in Cuba.''
</P>
<P>
   Eduardo Cobo, 23, also was disturbed by the attention focused on
Elian, especially in light of how other immigrant children are
regarded when they arrive in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't fair,'' Cobo said. ``If it was another kid who is not
like Elian, like a Haitian, for example, it would not get the same
attention. If he were to be from Haiti or Ecuador or wherever,
nobody would pay attention to that.''

GORE HOPES TO UNNERVE BUSH IN FLORIDA
</HEADLINE>
 By RICHARD L. BERKE  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ It seems these days as if Vice President Al Gore is
running for president of Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The night he clinched the Democratic presidential nomination,
Gore neglected five other states where there were primaries and
popped up in Tallahassee, the capital of Florida, for his victory
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   His advisers have been eagerly floating the name of Sen. Bob
Graham of Florida as a possible running mate _ even as Gore has
insisted that he has no short list yet.
</P>
<P>
   And in the most brazen gesture, Gore bucked his own
administration last week by declaring that 6-year-old Elian
Gonzalez should be granted permanent residence status in the United
States, a statement that drew furious responses from many loyal
Gore backers who called it a craven bid to win Cuban-American
votes.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, these and other early moves _ including Gore's
return later this week to West Palm Beach, Fort Lauderdale and
Tampa for more events _ seem to telegraph to Floridians that, yes,
he intends to compete energetically in a state that the Republicans
are counting on winning.
</P>
<P>
   In the minds of Gore's strategists, the maneuvers are aimed less
at the Florida electorate than at a far smaller audience in Austin,
Texas: Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican nominee.
</P>
<P>
   Mindful of the conventional wisdom that Bush needs to win
Florida more than Gore does, the vice president's campaign has
opened an all-out drive to appear competitive in Florida. The last
Republican to win the White House without winning Florida was
Calvin Coolidge in 1924. And Gore's aides are confident they can
win with victories in California and New York, even if they lose
Texas and Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The calculation is that Gore can rattle his foe and force him to
pump resources and campaign time into a state that only months ago
Bush's advisers had assumed he could win easily, at least in part
because Bush's brother Jeb happens to be the governor here.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can force Republicans to spend three or four dollars
for every one or two dollars you're spending, it's obviously to our
benefit,'' said a leading Gore strategist.
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview on Wednesday, Jeb Bush said his brother
was not about to be unnerved. Gore's behavior, he said, reminds him
of the campaign of Michael Dukakis, the Democratic presidential
nominee in 1988, who lost to Bush's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember the Dukakis campaign made a big deal about Florida,
they had four highly seasoned paid people,'' the Florida governor
recalled. ``By September we were saying good-bye to the Dukakis
campaign. They had packed their bags and left.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush acknowledged that the state is more
competitive now than it was in 1988 and that his brother cannot be
too complacent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Irrespective of these antics,'' he said, ``George needs to
take Florida very seriously because we are a swing state in many
ways. President Clinton carried the state in '96 _ it is an
indication that we can't take it for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   After months in which Bush was ahead in Florida with a
double-digit lead, polls now show that Gore has closed the gap. The
most recent poll, by Mason-Dixon Polling &AMP; Research, had Bush with
a lead of 8 percentage points. Gore's advisers say that winning
Florida is certainly possible, though by no means certain. Still, a
common belief among Gore advisers is that their efforts in Florida
come at little cost, particularly if they make Bush fight hard for
victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a tong war going on in Florida, that's a good
thing,'' said the Gore strategist. ``We don't necessarily need
it.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Asked about Gore's prospects in this state, the strategist said:
``You have to be smart about playing it. You don't want to be lured
by the sirens of a big win if it's not there. But there is a
potential for victory there, and it has to be explored and
exploited.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Robert A. Butterworth, the Florida attorney general and the
chairman of the Gore campaign in the state, said the Bush campaign
would be unwise to neglect Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush has no choice but to spend a lot of money here,''
Butterworth said. ``If he doesn't he's going to lose the state.''
</P>
<P>
   Republicans also are adroit at playing that game. For instance,
Bush has been traveling to California and insisting that he is
competing vigorously in that state. As with the vice president's
campaign in Florida, some Bush advisers concede that Gore has an
edge in California and that the Bush campaign could eventually
decide not to mount an all-out effort for victory in the state.
</P>
<P>
   But Florida, which has the fourth-largest trove of electoral
votes with 25, is especially alluring for Gore because, while it
leans Republican, Democrats are viewed as having a better chance
here than Republicans have in California.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's support among Cuban-Americans, Hispanics _ of
which Cubans are the largest subset _ make up only about 12 percent
of the state's electorate. And Democrats hope that black voters,
distressed by Gov. Jeb Bush's elimination of affirmative action in
university admissions and state government contracts, will turn out
more heavily in November. Black voters reliably vote Democratic.
But Republicans cite surveys showing that Democrats do not have as
strong a grip on the votes of the elderly as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   The Gore organization's effort to torment Bush is not without
costs. Even many of Gore's advisers have said privately that they
were confounded by the vice president's decision to break with the
president over the case of Elian Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The advisers said Gore was determined not to alienate the
state's powerful Cuban-American community, whose leaders believe
that Elian should not be sent back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush's advisers argue _ and many Gore aides do not dispute _
that the Cuban-American community in Florida is predisposed to back
Bush. And in reaching out to those voters, Gore may have alienated
liberals and immigrant groups around the country who complain that
he is showing favoritism toward Cuban-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know where it plays well other than in perhaps
demonstrating his independence,'' said Bob Poe, chairman of the
Florida Democratic Party. ``The Cuban community is not the base''
of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Gov. Jeb Bush said he could not see how Gore's
move would help Democrats. ``To disagree with the administration's
policy and do nothing about it doesn't ring with sincerity,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Miami, some Democrats who are not immigrants from Cuba
said they were offended by Gore's remarks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, I'm from Nicaragua and I want my 10-year-old son to get
residency here,'' said Lucia Madrid, 47, a housekeeper who has
lived in Miami for 17 years. ``Gore's going to do that for me? I
don't think so. He's just trying to get votes and is not thinking
of what he's doing. In general, I thought he was an OK candidate
until this. This is as cheap as he can get. And I'm certainly not
voting for him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Other Democrats seemed less exercised.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that he let down his own party to defend the Elian
Gonzalez cause doesn't bother me at all because it's only normal _
he's trying to win votes,'' said Elena Henriquez, 67, a retired
teacher from Nicaragua who arrived in Miami 11 years ago. ``He's
just saying Elian Gonzalez should become a resident. But he's not
actually doing anything about it. I think it's just a tactic.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Democratic and Republican strategists offered decidedly mixed
assessments of whether Gore's remarks about Elian would help him or
hurt him. But they seemed to agree that the political effect would
depend on how the matter is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on how it ends,'' Butterworth said. ``If the
INS goes in and brings out Elian with plastic handcuffs, and the
kid screaming, `I want to stay in America!' that will hurt anyone
who is associated with the administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Susan A. MacManus, a political scientist at the University of
South Florida in Tampa, said this state's rapidly changing
demographics made it impossible to predict what might happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think it's Bush's to lose,'' she said. ``But any
misstep and you might just lose one group of voters that you need
to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's aides and Republican officials said they were confident
that they would win Florida, but they expect a spirited contest.
Some Bush supporters even said they welcomed the Gore campaign's
drive to appear competitive here, saying it would only heighten
expectations for the vice president and spur Republicans here to
work harder for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   And Bush's brother did not seem exercised about Gore's courtship
of Graham.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure he whispers sweet nothings in other people's ears,''
Gov. Jeb Bush said. ``That's standard operating procedure.''

 &HT;    Good drives are a must to enjoy trip
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Expect horrible early traffic today for the first
round of the 64th Masters. Get as close to Washington Road as
possible, find a parking lot and head to the course.
</P>
<P>
   In case you haven't heard, there never has been a more pressing
need to arrive early on a Thursday. You might miss the whole
tournament. Tiger Woods starts at 10:38 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   To listen to the man's competitors, if he shoots a few strokes
under par, they might as well just start thinking about Pebble
Beach and the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   If it's a 68 or something lower, get the green jacket pressed _
a 44 Long, because Tiger's been working out so much since 1997 _
and get the TV lights ready in the Butler Cabin.
</P>
<P>
   Is that the probable story of this Masters? The oddsmakers say
there's nearly a 2-1 chance that Woods, who made Augusta National
his own private playground three years ago, will do it again. The
Masters committee, meanwhile, has grown rough and pinched the
fairways. ``I think the biggest adjustment is going to be the
fairways,'' Woods said. ``You can't go out there and take driving
for granted like you used to around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Such mower-driven changes affect veteran players, who have
collected unique local knowledge of Augusta National. But they
should be nothing major for the golfers at the top of the world
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like you come in here and say, `Wow, I've got to know
how this putt breaks or learn how this green reacts,' '' Greg
Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Augusta National allowed even off-line drives to
remain in the fairway. Unless they were positioned in the proper
section of the short grass, however, it was all but impossible to
guide an approach to the proper quadrant of the greens.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I've played well here in the past, I've always felt that
you had to drive the ball on the correct sides of the fairways,''
Woods said. ``The fairways were huge, but if you hit the ball down
the wrong side of the fairway, you have no flag. You had to play
the correct angles. Now, some of that's been moved over a little
bit. You have different angles. It's going to be quite a
challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Six-time champion Jack Nicklaus, who pointed out that the tree
lines always have been the guide to playing the course, was stunned
that the rough was cut in straight lines along the fairway. Now a
ball that in recent years was heading for fairway could end up in
the land of the flier lies.
</P>
<P>
   In a practice round this week, Norman and Nicklaus were being
shown the driving line on the 11th tee box by 19-year-old amateur
Aaron Baddeley, who had played several times the week before.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sorry,'' Nicklaus said to the gallery, smiling, ``I haven't
played this course before.''

PANEL URGES STRONGER REGULATION OF GENETICALLY ENGINEERED CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL KAESUK YOON and MELODY PETERSEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Saying that genetically engineered crops have the potential to
pose food safety risks and environmental harm, the National Academy
of Sciences on Wednesday cautiously endorsed the safety of biotech
foods now on the market, but called for stronger regulation of the
novel plants.
</P>
<P>
   The academy focused only on plants that have been genetically
engineered to produce their own pesticides. The report emphasized
that there was no evidence that any foods on supermarket shelves
made from those plants are unsafe to eat. The report also said that
the process of inserting genes from one species into another was
not inherently dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the report is a striking shift in tone from two earlier
academy reports on the subject, which emphasized the safety and
benefits of genetically modified organisms.
</P>
<P>
   In the last decade, genetic engineers have inserted foreign
genes into plants to endow them with various abilities including
withstanding exposure to herbicides and creating their own
pesticide. The crops have been popular with American farmers, who
last year planted 20 million acres of a corn that produces its own
pesticide, Bt. But Greenpeace and other environmental and consumer
groups have waged campaigns against such crops, arguing that they
pose serious risks.
</P>
<P>
   The report was prepared by a 12-member panel chosen by the
National Research Council, an arm of the National Academy of
Science. The report grew from a dispute over a rule proposed by the
Environmental Protection Agency in 1994 that would allow it to
regulate these plants. Although the agency has been operating under
this rule informally, the rule's formal adoption has been held up
for six years by the protests of thousands of agricultural
scientists and their supporters in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The academy recommended that the EPA's rule be adopted and
strengthened. It said that the government should consider
conducting studies that test for harm from long-term consumption of
biotech foods that may contain different and possibly more
dangerous substances than those now marketed.
</P>
<P>
   The report also recommended that the EPA extend its regulation
to crops engineered to be resistant to viruses, most of which are
now exempt from oversight, and which some fear have the potential
to create so-called super weeds.
</P>
<P>
   Both anti-biotech activists and industry claimed victory from
different parts of the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good news for people who want stronger regulation,'' said
Dr. Jane Rissler, senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned
Scientists. ``It's good news for people who feel that there are
risks.'' She added that the academy, long accused of being
pro-biotech, was ``singing a new tune.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Val Giddings, vice president for food and agriculture at the
Biotechnology Industry Organization, a trade group of hundreds of
biotech companies, said, ``This is a strong affirmation of the
academy's previous reports and an emphatic reaffirmation of what
the industry has been saying for years, that these products are
safe and subject to more regulatory scrutiny than any others in
history.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In Washington on Wednesday morning, as the academy prepared to
release the report, about two dozen demonstrators protested outside
the academy building. Even though the panel called for stronger
regulation, some environmental and consumer groups criticized the
report, saying that it had been tainted by the industry ties of 6
of the 12 members on the panel that wrote it. Two of the members _
a consultant and a lawyer _ work at private firms that work for
biotechnology companies. The other four are university scientists
who have received research money from biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Dr. Michael J. Phillips, the academy scientist who
had managed the proceedings of the panel, left midway through the
study to take a top executive position at the Biotechnology
Industry Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The environmental and consumer groups, backed by Rep. Dennis J.
Kucinich, D-Ohio, demanded that the study be abandoned and begin
again with a new panel of experts. ``The committee is hopelessly
tainted,'' said Andrew Kimbrell, director of the Center for Food
Safety in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   But Dr. E. William Colglazier, the academy's executive officer,
said the academy stands behind the study. The academy conducted an
internal review of the accusations that Kucinich had made about the
conflicts, Colglazier said, and found that the panel ``meets our
standards of scientific quality, evidence, objectivity and
independence.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, the panel said tests for allergens and toxins
were needed, noting that the novel crops could contain increased
toxins or new allergens. The EPA, however, oversees only
pesticide-producing plants. The Food and Drug Administration
recommends that companies developing biotech plants consult the
agency on safety, but it does not require tests and largely allows
the companies to police themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The panel did not recommend that the FDA change its policies,
but the report will put more pressure on that agency to strengthen
its rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``There needs to be some caution here,'' said Dr. Fred Gould, a
professor at North Carolina State University, who sat on the panel.
Gould said that the panel was questioning the often-repeated claim
of proponents of biotechnology that ``a tomato is a tomato'' no
matter how it was created. ``That is something we need to
reconsider,'' Gould said. ``Not all tomatoes are equal.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the regulatory system applauded the panel's
recommendation that the EPA begin reviewing plants genetically
engineered with resistance to viral diseases. The plants carry
foreign genes taken from the viruses that confer protection against
the disease. Ecologists have expressed concern about the potential
for such plants to interbreed with wild plants, conferring
virus-resistance and creating a super weed.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The report also agreed with scientists who have criticized the
Agriculture Department's handling of ecological risks. The panel
found that the department had lacked adequate scientific support
for its controversial approval of a biotech squash, which some
feared could produce a super weed.
</P>
<P>
   The report also acknowledged the potential for harm to monarch
butterflies from Bt corn plants, as suggested by a study out of
Cornell University last May. Since the study came out, companies
selling the corn have insisted on the plant's safety. The report
noted that further field studies were required to determine to what
extent, if any, monarchs are being harmed in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question mark,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the panel's conclusions disappointed members of 11
scientific societies, many of whom work in genetic engineering or
in other agricultural research, who had originally asked the
academy to do the study. The scientists in the societies had
harshly criticized the proposed rule and had lobbied to have much
of it thrown out.
</P>
<P>
   The academy decided to prepare the report released Wednesday
after at least one plant scientist, Arthur Kelman, a professor at
North Carolina State University, approached top officials at the
academy with the societies' concerns, said Dr. R. James Cook, a
plant pathologist.
</P>
<P>
   Cook said Wednesday that he was disappointed that the panel had
recommended that the EPA's proposed rules be strengthened rather
than weakened. ``In a couple of years,'' he said, ``we will see
that this is overkill.''
</P>
<P>
   But Cook said that many scientists had begun to reconsider their
position that the technology requires little or no government
regulation. With the growing opposition to genetically engineered
plants, he said, scientists realize that strong government
regulation could help ease the public's fears. ``We're at risk of
losing this technology,'' Cook said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The independent prosecutor who has been
investigating accusations of corruption involving Alexis Herman,
the secretary of labor, said Wednesday that he has concluded that
Herman did not break any laws and should not be indicted.
</P>
<P>
   Herman, the fifth Cabinet officer in the Clinton administration
to come under the scrutiny of an independent counsel, was accused
by a former business partner of engaging in a plan involving
kickbacks and solicitation of illegal campaign contributions to the
Democratic Party. But the independent counsel, Ralph Lancaster, who
conducted the 23-month investigation, announced in a one-sentence
statement Wednesday that he would not seek an indictment of Herman.
</P>
<P>
   Herman said she was ``gratified personally and for my family''
that the investigation was over. Her lawyer, Neil Eggleston, said
Herman had cooperated ``in every way possible'' with Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations against Herman were made by Laurent Yene, a
Cameroonian businessman living in the United States who said
Herman, while head of the White House office of public liaison,
improperly agreed to accept payments in return for generating
business for a consulting firm owned jointly by Yene and a close
friend of Herman's, Vanessa Weaver.
</P>
<P>
   Yene also accused Herman of directing Weaver to pressure the
firm's clients to illegally contribute money to the Democratic
National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The donations would have been illegal because some of the
clients were foreign citizens, who are prohibited by law from
donating to candidates in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Barcella, a lawyer for Weaver and her sister, Caryliss,
said Wednesday that he had been notified that Lancaster had also
decided there were no grounds to prosecute his clients.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's decision is not only a welcome relief for Herman,
but it could help Vice President Al Gore, because any indictment of
her could have proved an embarrassment for his presidential
campaign. Some of the accusations against her involving
fund-raising were connected to the system of raising money for the
Democratic Party by holding White House coffees, an issue with
which Gore was closely connected.

   President Clinton issued a statement Wednesday repeating his
insistence that Herman had done nothing wrong and saying he was
``proud to call her my friend.'' He said Herman ``did not deserve
what she had to endure over the past many months.''

   The four other Cabinet officers who were investigated were
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt, who was cleared last October by
an independent counsel of charges that he lied about his role in an
Interior Department decision to deny an application by three Indian
tribes to operate a casino in Hudson, Wis.; former Housing
Secretary Henry Cisneros, who pleaded guilty to one misdemeanor
count of lying to the FBI about payments to a former mistress;
former Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy, who was acquitted of
corruption accusations, and Ronald Brown, who was commerce
secretary until his death in a plane crash in Croatia in April
1996. The corruption investigation of Brown ended with his death.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 16, Lancaster obtained an indictment against Abdul
Rahman, a Singapore businessman, accusing him of lying about the
source of $200,000 in political contributions to Democratic Party
groups. Rahman was charged with a felony count of making a false
statement and eight misdemeanor counts of improperly making
political contributions as a foreign citizen. He is the only person
indicted during Lancaster's inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Barcella, the lawyer for the Weaver sisters, said his clients
were relieved at the outcome. ``It's been an ordeal,'' he said,
adding that the investigation showed many flaws in the independent
counsel law.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that it took a couple of years and $4 million or
$5 million of public money,'' he said. ``This is why the
independent counsel law is well buried.''
</P>
<P>
   The law providing for the appointments of independent counsels
expired last June after having produced over the years bipartisan
disgust and weariness. Republicans first complained that the
Iran-Contra investigation, which spanned the Reagan and Bush
administrations, was an effort to use the criminal law to challenge
political actions.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats found themselves saying much the same thing about the
Whitewater investigation of President Clinton, which spread into
many areas and resulted in last year's impeachment battle.
</P>
<P>
   The track record of the independent counsels used to investigate
Cabinet officers during the Clinton administration is ammunition
for both supporters and opponents of the law.
</P>
<P>
   The law was designed in part to make it more credible when a
senior administration official is investigated and cleared by an
outside lawyer rather than the Justice Department. That was the
case with Babbitt when the decision to clear him was widely
accepted.
</P>
<P>
   But to critics of the law, the investigations of Cisneros and
Espy showed its flaws. Cisneros pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor
after a four-year investigation that cost $10 million and saw him
originally charged with 18 felony counts. Espy was acquitted of all
charges.
</P>
<P>
   When Reno sought the appointment of an independent counsel in
Herman's case, she emphasized that she had no choice but to do so
under the law.

DAVIS CUP: DOSEDEL HAS STAR QUALITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LEE BARNATHAN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; INGLEWOOD, Calif. _ The United States hasn't cornered the
Hollywood market for this weekend's Davis Cup quarterfinal.
</P>
<P>
   And the winner for best actor at the Czech Film Festival . . .
Slava Dosedel?
</P>
<P>
   It seems fitting that Dosedel is part of the Czech Republic team
that will play the U.S. starting Friday at the Forum, near the
heart of film industry. He'll soon be spending time with the movie
camera focused on him.
</P>
<P>
   He said Wednesday he would rather surpass Ivan Lendl as his
country's most famous tennis player than try to make it as an
actor. Still, because of his uncanny resemblance to a Czech doctor
who cured high fever in the 1800s with cold-water therapy, as well
as his living the same healthy, vegetarian lifestyle as said
doctor, Dosedel in October starred in ``Life Water.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He had the same opinion of life like me,'' Dosedel said. ``He
was trying to treat people with nature's type of life, eating
right, drinking right, not partying.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosedel learned his lines while on tour, then flew to the Czech
Republic to film. The movie debuted in the doctor's hometown of
Jesenik.
</P>
<P>
   However, being a movie star there isn't the same as here, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People recognize me as a tennis player,'' he said. ``I'm on
the tour 10 years. They don't bother me. When I'm home (in Prerov),
I'm in a small town and everybody knows me. They don't bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosedel, on tour since 1989, is ranked No. 48 in the world. His
best finish this season is a quarterfinal loss at Sydney,
Australia. The next week, at the Australian Open, he lost in the
fourth round to Pete Sampras, who he could face in Sunday's reverse
singles.
</P>
<P>
   __ Czech them out: The other Czech team members, Jiri Novak,
David Rikl and Martin Damm, who each have at least two years of
Davis Cup experience, haven't been particularly successful. They've
combined for a 14-17 record.
</P>
<P>
   Novak has had the most Davis success. He's 5-1 in singles
matches and 4-0 when teamed with Rikl. In the first-round against
Great Britain in February, Novak accounted for all three of his
team's points.
</P>
<P>
   Novak is ranked 39th in singles, and he and Rikl are the world's
fifth-ranked doubles team. This season, they reached the Australian
Open quarterfinals, won an event in Dubai and have reached the
semifinals in Auckland, New Zealand, and Rotterdam, The
Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   Damm, a late addition to the team (he replaces Daniel Vacek), is
ranked tied for 65th, but he reached the Ericsson Open doubles
final last week at Key Biscayne, Fla. Captain Jan Kukal chose the
hotter player.
</P>
<P>
   However, Damm probably won't play. Kukal is leaning toward
playing Novak and Dosedel in singles and Novak and Rikl in doubles.

   Judge Sets Deadline in May for Microsoft Penalty Plan
</P>
<P>
   The next phase of the Microsoft antitrust case should be wrapped
up by late May under a schedule set by Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson, who is presiding over the case. The timetable calls for
the Justice Department to propose remedies by April 28 and for
Microsoft to make its proposal on May 10. State attorneys general,
meanwhile, appeared to be giving up any attempt to force the
breakup of Microsoft.

<P>
   `Yield Burning' Case Settled
</P>
<P>
   More than a dozen Wall Street investment banks, led by
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, have agreed to pay more than
$120 million to end federal investigations into whether they
overcharged state and local governments nationwide for Treasuries.
</P>
<P>
   Metropolitan Life Issues Shares
</P>
<P>
   The Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. issued nearly 500 million
shares to more than 9 million policyholders, making the company's
shares the most widely held in America. Shares the company sold in
its initial public stock offering closed at $15.375, up from their
initial price of $14.25. Robert Benmosche, the company's chief
executive, said the company was in the position to raise more
capital and make acquisitions if it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Arms Charges Filed in Satellite Case
</P>
<P>
   The State Department charged Lockheed Martin with 30 violations

</P>
<P>
   Stock markets in Asia were battered as investors sold
technology, Internet and telecommunications shares. The Hang Seng
index of stocks traded in Hong Kong was the biggest loser, falling
3.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   European stocks fell, pulled down by technology shares that had
been leading the market higher. But British investors could not
trade for much of the day because of an unexplained technical
problem that crippled the London Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Posts Profit of $78 Million
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it earned $78 million in the first quarter, up from
$1.8 million a year earlier, helped by growth in its overseas
operations. The company reported a sharp increase in the number
users visiting the Yahoo Web site. Yahoo's shares fell $1.8125, to
$165.5625. The company released its results after the close of the
market, and in after-hours trading, its stock fell as low as
$159.75 a share.

<P>
   Fact Over Supply-Side Fiction
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan campaigned for president promising to shrink the
federal government, and once he reached the White House he pushed a
huge tax cut through Congress. But his mission ultimately failed.
In fiscal 2000, the share of the gross domestic product collected

from an average of 18.7 percent during the last five
pre-Reagan-administration years.

3 MORE STATES JOIN ANTITRUST INVESTIGATION OF GUN INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Fla., Mass., Md., Calif.)  By FOX BUTTERFIELD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ California, Florida and Massachusetts said Wednesday
they would join New York, Connecticut and Maryland in an antitrust
investigation of the gun industry to determine whether firearms
companies have conspired against Smith &AMP; Wesson, the nation's
largest gun maker, after it agreed to restrictions on how it
manufactures and distributes handguns.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Blumenthal, the Connecticut attorney general who is
helping to coordinate the investigation, said that more states
might join and that the states would work as ``a single team in
what will be essentially a national investigation that can reach
beyond any of our borders.'' Some subpoenas have already been
issued, Blumenthal said, and a task force will begin interviewing
witnesses soon.
</P>
<P>
   The joint action amounts to the first large-scale governmental
inquiry into the industry after years in which gun makers, with
backing from the National Rifle Association, have been able to
avoid congressional or state investigations.
</P>
<P>
   The antitrust investigation also comes as 30 cities and counties
have filed lawsuits against gun manufacturers, wholesalers and
retail dealers. Some cases are expected to soon reach the discovery
phase, during which lawyers for the municipalities hope to uncover
documents showing the gun industry was aware its sales practices
helped make it easy for criminals and juveniles to buy handguns.
The suits against the gun makers charge them with failing to
incorporate safety devices and negligently marketing their guns so
that criminals can buy them.
</P>
<P>
   In the antitrust investigation, state officials will seek
evidence that gun companies have colluded to bring pressure on
Smith &AMP; Wesson, a unit of Tomkins PLC in Springfield, Mass., after
it agreed on March 17 to broad restrictions in return for some of
the cities ending their suits against it.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a Chicago law firm that handled many Smith &AMP; Wesson
cases has said it will stop representing the company, a large
wholesaler has said it will stop distributing Smith &AMP; Wesson guns
and some dealers have said they will no longer sell its products.
The question is whether these are independent actions or an
organized effort to harm the company.
</P>
<P>
   The National Shooting Sports Foundation, the gun industry trade
group, has insisted that the actions were spontaneous and
independent and not part of a campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The states are acting under their own antitrust laws, which are
modeled on national antitrust statutes.

ANIMAL BACKERS SAY TEXAS TOWN TOO EAGER TO KILL BEAVERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARVEY RICE 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   STAGECOACH, Texas _ No one disputes that beavers have felled
trees on private property and their burrows threaten a levee in
this East Texas town of about 450.
</P>
<P>
   But what seemed a straightforward decision to use traps that
would drown the mischievous rodents has turned into a showdown with
those who oppose killing them.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Stagecoach Farms Civic Club asked the Texas
Wildlife Management Service in February to trap the beavers after
discovering they had toppled a crepe myrtle planted in memory of a
former constable.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the club, which owns the city's two beaver-infested
lakes, were miffed later when they discovered that Cathy McNew, a
veterinarian's assistant, had phoned the service and canceled the
trapping request.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all are a little mad because we've already made our
democratic vote and this lady decided she doesn't want to let us be
a democracy,'' Municipal Judge Roger Daigger said.
</P>
<P>
   McNew, backed by the national group People for the Ethical
Treatment of Animals, favors methods that encourage the beavers to
move on, such as wrapping tree bases with chicken wire or painting
them with a latex-and-sand solution.
</P>
<P>
   The trapping request was renewed, but that didn't stop McNew.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've talked to numerous residents in the area and most are
aghast that they were going to be killing the animals,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The club held a March 31 meeting at which she presented
alternatives to lethal trapping, but it became raucous and the
members again voted to trap the beavers. They agreed, however, to
give McNew a chance to convince residents to put wire around trees
or trap beavers alive.
</P>
<P>
   She persisted, saying most of the community didn't know that
trapping would kill the beavers.
</P>
<P>
   The issue is to be decided at a club meeting Sunday. McNew
agreed to abide by the decision.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Daigger said there are thousands of trees near Apache Lake and
Hardin Lake, making it impractical to consider McNew's methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't protect every single tree,'' he said Wednesday. ``We
need the state to (set traps) because her method has never been
successful and by the time she gets rid of those beavers we won't
have any trees left.``
</P>
<P>
   Roger Dolle, a management biologist with the Texas Wildlife
Damage Management Service, examined damage to the levee, which is
topped by an important road and is threatened by collapse because
of beaver burrowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees are not the main thing,'' he said. ``The beavers are
burrowing underneath the (levee) and no wire or paint is going to
stop them from doing that.``
</P>
<P>
   But Ali Hegler, a licensed wildlife rehabilitator who is to
speak at Sunday's meeting, said she believes wire mesh could keep
the beavers away.
</P>
<P>
   PETA spokeswoman Stephanie Boyles, who has written to the club
listing nonlethal control methods, said beavers venture only a
short distance from water, so only a limited number of trees would
need protection with wire or paint. She also said beavers eat trees
only in the winter when other vegetation is unavailable.
</P>
<P>
   Boyles said the method has been used successfully in the
Northeast, where beavers have long been a problem. She also said
many communities have recruited Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts to put
wire around trees.

 &HT;    Lee Petty, 86, NASCAR pioneer, patriarch of racing family
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Lee Petty didn't start driving race cars until he was
33, but he became one of stock car racing's greatest drivers. His
two sons went on to make the family name one of the most
recognizable in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Petty, who had three generations of his family follow him
into NASCAR's Winston Cup Series, died Wednesday at Moses Cone
Hospital in Greensboro, N.C. He was 86. He had surgery for a
stomach aneurysm several weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Petty's son Richard is NASCAR's winningest driver, with
seven Winston Cup championships and 200 victories. His grandson
Kyle has eight wins, and his great-grandson Adam ran his first
Winston Cup race Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Petty owned a garage in his hometown of Level Cross, N.C.,
and worked on hot rods before he tried driving race cars.
</P>
<P>
   In an injury-shortened 15-year career, he won three Winston Cup
championships and 54 races, including the first Daytona 500 in
1959. In that race, he and Johnny Beauchamp swapped the lead 11
times in the final laps, then finished in a dead heat. Three days
later, photos showed Mr. Petty's No. 42 had won by inches.
</P>
<P>
   He was as successful on dirt tracks as on the paved
superspeedways, and he didn't shy away from the on-track knocking
and banging common in NASCAR's early days.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gazaway of Newnan, a retired vice president and competition
director of NASCAR, said Mr. Petty also won because he took care of
his equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was smart in that he didn't try to run out front all the
time, like Joe Weatherly and some of the others did,'' Mr. Gazaway
said. ``A lot of times he'd run a six-cylinder Plymouth against the
bigger V-8 engines. They'd blow up, and there he'd be leading the
race.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Smith, who raced against Lee and Richard Petty, said Lee
Petty was one of racing's innovators. ``He tried different things
and found parts that wouldn't break,'' Mr. Smith said. ``And he
knew how to get help from manufacturers like Oldsmobile and
Chrysler.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Winston Cup champion Rex White said he first met Lee
Petty when Mr. Petty showed up at a race with his entire family
riding in the car he drove in the race. He said Mr. Petty always
treated racing like a business and was willing to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd do anything to win a race because he liked those
dollars,'' Mr. White said. ``He was a lot like David Pearson in
that he didn't worry about qualifying, he just wanted to be fast at
the end of the race. He always came prepared to take money home.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Petty drove in NASCAR's inaugural race at a dirt track in
Charlotte in 1949 and retired in 1964. His career essentially ended
on the last lap of a 125-mile qualifying race at Daytona Beach,
Fla., in 1961. He and Mr. Beauchamp, whom he battled to win the
inaugural Daytona 500, locked bumpers, and both cars hurtled over
the guardrail and out of the speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Petty suffered multiple injuries and ran only six more
events before retiring.
</P>
<P>
   But the company he started, Petty Enterprises, kept thriving,
winning seven more championships and a total of 271 races.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Petty stayed out of the public eye but made many of the
major decisions for his race teams. His sons played the key roles,
with Richard the primary driver and Maurice the engine builder.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Kyle and Adam Petty drive for Petty Enterprises, along
with John Andretti.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Smith said Lee Petty made his sons work hard for everything
they got.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was tough on those kids,'' Mr. Smith said. ``He wanted
things done his way.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1959 at Lakewood Speedway in Atlanta, it appeared that
Richard Petty, then 21, had gotten his first victory in Winston Cup
(then called Grand National). But his father, who had finished
second, demanded a recheck of scoring cards. Richard was stripped
of the win; it was awarded to Lee.
</P>
<P>
   When asked why he challenged his son's first victory, Mr. Petty
replied: ''I don't reckon I regret it. When he wins, he can have
it, but he ain't going to have it given to him.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Gazaway said those hard lessons are the reason Petty
Enterprises has remained strong as NASCAR has grown.
</P>
<P>
   ``He drove those boys hard to be successful,'' Mr. Gazaway said.
``They started out in an old chicken house with a dirt floor and
built a dynasty.''
</P>
<P>
   A private graveside service for family members will be held
later this week. The family asked that instead of flowers,
donations be sent to Level Cross United Methodist Church Building
Fund, 10142 U.S. 220 North, Randleman, NC 27317.

GREENSPAN SAYS FED IS NOT AIMING TO FORCE DOWN STOCK PRICES 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This article is part of TIMES EXPRESS. It is a condensed
version of a story that will appear in tomorrow's New York Times.) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A day after Wall Street endured one of its most
unnerving rides, Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman,
offered soothing words to investors Wednesday, saying as explicitly
as he ever has that the central bank's interest rate increases are
not intended to drive down stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   But as he has now for months, Greenspan continued to identify
the wealth being generated by rising stock prices as the primary
cause of imbalances in the economy that could potentially lead to
inflation.
</P>
<P>
   Greenspan seemed intent on drawing a distinction between raising
or lowering interest rates based on movements in the stock market _
a strategy he said would be ineffective and perhaps inappropriate
for the Fed to attempt _ and acknowledging that Wall Street's
effects on the rest of the economy are so powerful that they have
to be taken into account in monetary policy.
</P>
<P>
   The distinction was subtle if not meaningless to some analysts
and investors. In their view, Greenspan wants to have it both ways,
putting pressure on the markets without taking heat for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each time he denies that he's targeting asset prices, he
highlights the fact that equity prices are central to monetary
policy at the moment,'' said Rory Robertson, an economist at
Macquarie Bank in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking at a White House conference on the technology and the
economy, Greenspan was much clearer that he is sticking for now to
his strategy of raising rates in small steps until he is sure that
the economy is on an even keel. In Greenspan's view, growth in
demand is exceeding the corresponding increase in supply because it
stems not from an increase in the nation's capacity to produce but
from the wealth created by rising prices for stocks, homes and
other assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rise in stock prices, as well as in the capital gains on
homes, has created a marked increase in purchasing power without
providing an equivalent and immediate expansion in the supply of
goods and services,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists, analysts and investors have taken Greenspan to mean
that the most direct way to bring supply and demand back into
balance is to choke off the wealth effect. But Wednesday, Greenspan
moved closer to the more traditional central bank position that the
remedy is as simple and as complex as slowing the entire economy,
halting the gradual drop in unemployment and arresting the growth
in the trade deficit.

<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ It is not a get-it-in-play, easy-on-the-Zantac
starting hole.
</P>
<P>
   Not with a sleeping sand monster on the right side and a lip as
high as a curb on Washington Road.
</P>
<P>
   Not with a power-fade tee shot required to carry a giant fairway
bunker about 270 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   Not with a sloping green that hasn't allowed a straight putt
since Tom Watson threw out his last pair of plaid bell-bottoms.
</P>
<P>
   Not with that famous scoreboard at the bottom of the hill, with
its international flags fluttering in the breeze.
</P>
<P>
   Not with all those little green chairs surrounding the tee box
and their inhabitants so clearly spoiled by past performances from
Nicklaus, Palmer, Player, Snead and Nelson. The hole is 410 yards.
Uphill, turning right. Sometimes into the wind. With trees on the
left, where a fairway quickly disappears for a ball drawn too
sharply.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get jumpy when you get up there,'' Sea Island's Davis Love
III said, ``but the more you play, the easier it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Nervous? I think `anxious' is maybe a better word,'' Steve
Elkington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unavoidable to get a little nervous on that tee box,''
Jeff Sluman said. ``You want to hit a good shot, get your legs
under you, get the round started in a positive way.''
</P>
<P>
   John Daly said, ``I get butterflies on every hole out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly has blown it left, into the 9th fairway. He has hit a ball
so far right on No. 1 that it's been closer to the media center
than the fairway. He is about the only player who would even think
of launching his approach over the trees, from that right side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, but that's the greatest way to go into that hole, out of
the straw,'' Daly said, ``because you're hitting back into the
slope. You can hit it into that bank and spin it a little better.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a tee box with more distractions than anywhere else on the
course. People pack the area from early in the morning. With the
big oak tree at the clubhouse a gathering place for conversation
and interviews, No. 1, known as Tea Olive, is a place where
commotion sometimes must be blocked out.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of people around there,'' said Bernhard
Langer, who had a four-shot lead after 54 holes in 1993 and
promptly bogeyed No.1 to begin his Sunday. ``It's a busy place.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price will never forget the first hole at Augusta. On a
near flawless day in 1986, when he tied the Masters record with a
9-under-par 63, he bogeyed No. 1. It's a tee shot that demands a
lot of accuracy, contrasting to much of the course, known for its
room to roam.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tougher hole for the average-length hitters,'' he said.
``Not for the long hitters. They still blow it over that bunker.
But if you've got any kind of a draw on a ball that starts down the
middle of the fairway, invariably, you're going to end up in that
left rough, or second cut. Then, basically, on your second shot,
you're just aiming for the front right-hand portion of the green.
It's difficult. It's probably one of the more specific strategy
holes on the golf course.''
</P>
<P>
   If the flagstick is in the left half of the green in the back,
players have to guard against going left and long, which means an
almost automatic bogey. Unless the pin is back right, the approach
has to be short and right of the hole.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players the assumption is that the Masters committee,
having exhausted all other ways to lengthen the hole without anyone
really noticing, has taken extreme measures.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be a pretty easy tee shot, but now they've
lengthened the tee by about 30 yards,'' Steve Elkington said.
``Davis Love asked them if they put in a new tee and they said,
`No.' And Davis said, `Well, you've either moved the tee or moved
the clubhouse, one or the other.'''
</P>
<P>
   It's only a tough tee shot for those who don't own the 285-yard
power-fade, which is probably 80 percent of the field. The carry
over the huge fairway bunker on the right used to be about 260
yards. Now the caddie books put it more like 275.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be you teed off down there by the pro shop
almost,'' Elkington said. ``Now you're about 10 steps off the
putting green.''
</P>
<P>
   Standing on the first tee at the Masters with all the pressure
building, said Jeff Sluman, sometimes it's hard to get yourself to
hit a left-to-right shot. The more natural tendency is to swing
harder than you want to and more likely draw the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``People talk about how you need to hit the ball right to left
at Augusta, but the fact is, there's every bit as many left to
right shots as there are right to left,'' left-hander Phil
Mickelson said. ``At No. 1, boy, if you hit a draw as a
right-handed player, you're going to go right into those trees.
You've got to cut it if you're going to take it over that bunker.''
Ernie Els said the trouble off the tee and the approach shot are
only the beginning. ``To be honest, that green is one of the most
difficult greens on the golf course. You're really just trying to
make four and get out of there.''

GERMAN BANKS CANCEL MERGER PLANS
</HEADLINE>
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service  
  FRANKFURT _ Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank of Germany canceled a
planned $29 billion merger on Wednesday, only a month after they
had announced the deal. Their action set the stage for new takeover
bids in Germany's once-impenetrable banking industry.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The demise of what would have been the biggest bank combination
in Europe came after a bitter disagreement over the fate of
Dresdner's investment banking business, Dresdner Kleinwort Benson,
which Deutsche Bank wanted to sell or disband and Dresdner wanted
to keep.
</P>
<P>
   By failing to complete the merger, the two banks remain exposed
to long-term structural weaknesses at a time when rival banks in
Europe are shoring up their own power in a wave of deal-making.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years banks have merged or announced plans to
merge in Switzerland, France, Britain, Spain and other countries.
Germany has been an exception, even though its banking market is
one of the most crowded and least profitable in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said that Dresdner, Germany's third-largest bank, would
almost certainly become a takeover target, possibly pursued by a
big U.S. company like Chase Manhattan or Citigroup.
</P>
<P>
   Many said Dresdner was too small to manage on its own, and they
warned that its investment banking business had been gravely
damaged by the recent feuding.
</P>
<P>
   The collapse also is a setback for Deutsche Bank, Europe's
largest bank. Its chairman, Rolf-Ernst Breuer, has dismayed
investors with contradictory statements about his plans and
apparent disagreements with his executives.
</P>
<P>
   But the most immediate loser may be Allianz AG, the German
insurance conglomerate that owns big stakes in both banks. Allianz
engineered much of the deal, and its executives are said to be
furious. Even before the dust had settled, people close to Allianz
said the company would be open to new deals involving foreign and
German banks.
</P>
<P>
   As a part of the merger, Allianz would have taken control of the
retail branches of the two banks and acquired Deutsche Bank's
mutual fund business. The idea was to let the banks escape the
business of running local branch networks, which barely broke even,
and focus on lucrative fields like investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Allianz shares plunged 14 percent on Wednesday, to 380 euros,
their biggest decline in 10 years. (One euro equals about 96 cents)
By contrast, Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank stock jumped amid
relief from investors who had soured on the plan. Deutsche Bank,
which had declined 21 percent since the takeover was disclosed on
March 9, rose 4 percent, to 80.01 euros, or $76.80.
</P>
<P>
   Dresdner shares, which has also taken a drubbing, jumped 4.3
percent, to 49 euros, or $47.04
</P>
<P>
   Executives of both banks acknowledged on Wednesday that the deal
fell apart over the fate of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. Though
Breuer said last month that Kleinwort Benson was ``a jewel,'' and
would neither be sold nor shut down, he reversed himself a few days
later and began pushing for an outright sale.
</P>
<P>
   That plan ran into opposition from Bernhard Walter, chairman of
Dresdner Bank. Deutsche Bank then agreed ``to integrate'' Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson, but, according to Dresdner executives, insisted
on eliminating the jobs of most employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``In both word and spirit, Deutsche Bank rejected a balanced
integration of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson,'' Dresdner Bank said in
an unusually pointed statement on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a contractual agreement, but we had more than that _ we
had an understanding,'' one Dresdner executive said. ``If they
wanted to shut down Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, then they should
have taken us over. But if they did that, they would have had to
pay a control premium.''
</P>
<P>
   Breuer, in another reversal, replied that the deal had never
been planned as a ``merger of equals.''
</P>
<P>
   Had the deal been completed, some specialists said, it would
have transformed the German financial market and eased some of the
overcrowding that has dragged down banking profits.
</P>
<P>
   As envisioned, the two banks would have consolidated their
corporate and investment banking activities, but spun off their
vast and barely profitable retail banking businesses.
</P>
<P>
   This new retail bank would have been controlled by Allianz,
which planned to use the branch network as a channel for selling
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   For the banks, the idea was to concentrate on lucrative
businesses like investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts said that the two companies had a lot of
overlapping activity in the investment banking area and that they
had little choice but to impose severe staff reductions.
</P>
<P>
   (Begin optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   The biggest dispute seems to have been in global bond and equity
trading. Deutsche Bank has built a huge presence in bond trading,
largely under the leadership of Edson Mitchell, an American
recruited from Merrill Lynch.
</P>
<P>
   Industry executives say Mitchell did not want to cede much if
any territory to counterparts at Dresdner, and fear of an exodus of
valued eecutives prompted Deutsche Bank to toughen its position.
</P>
<P>
   Josef Ackermann, the Deutsche board member in charge of all
investment banking, led the charge in favor of simply selling
Dresdner Kleinwort Benson, then later proposed eliminating most of
its trading operations.
</P>
<P>
   Investors, after a euphoric reaction when the deal was
announced, have been pounding the shares of both banks, in part
because of uncertainty over cost reductions.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty was provoking a rush for the exits among
executives at Dresdner Kleinwort Benson. Salomon Smith Barney
recruited its seven-member team of analysts covering the utilities
industry. And a top Dresdner executive said on Wednesday that
scores of others were planning to defect.
</P>
<P>
   ``This became a matter of hours,'' the executive said. ``If we
hadn't made a decision immediately, we would have lost so many
people.''
</P>
<P>
   John Leonard, a banking analyst at Salomon Smith Barney, said
the damage had been severe but might have been inevitable. ``The
only thing that could have rescued it would have been a neat, clean
sale of Dresdner Kleinwort Benson,'' Leonard said.
</P>
<P>
   An analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity said Dresdner
Kleinwort Benson's problems might be irreparable. Given that
Dresdner came so close to selling the company, he said, it will
have a very hard time recruiting or retaining deal makers and
traders.
</P>
<P>
   (End optional trim)
</P>
<P>
   Within Germany, there are not too many options for expansion.
The most obvious path would be a merger of Dresdner and the
Munich-based Hypovereinsbank AG, in which Allianz also holds a big
stake.
</P>
<P>
   In theory, Dresdner could also start talks with Commerzbank, the
fourth largest. But Commerzbank has thus far rebuffed all
overtures.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign banks could decide that this is the time too make their
own moves. Dresdner already has a longstanding relationship with
Banque Nationale de Paris, which acquired the rival Paribas last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But other foreign banks have been seeking acquisitions for some
time: HSBC reached agreement last weekend to acquire Credit
Commercial de France in a deal worth $10.6 billion. ABN Amro of the
Netherlands has been acquiring smaller banks across Europe.
</P>
<P>
   American financial institutions like Citigroup and Chase
Manhattan may also be interested. According to European press
reports, Chase Manhattan expressed interest in Dresdner Kleinwort
Benson before Dresdner shut the door on a sale. (mg)

ARMY GENERAL UNDER INVESTIGATION HAD WON KEY APPOINTMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The general accused of sexual harassment in 1996 by
the Army's highest-ranking woman was appointed last August to be
the service's deputy inspector general, an officer responsible for
investigating accusations of wrongdoing, including sexual
misconduct, Pentagon officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The movement of the officer, Maj. Gen. Larry G. Smith, into that
job has been frozen while the Army's inspector general investigates
the accusation by Lt. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy that Smith made an
unwanted sexual advance in her office at the Pentagon, the
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy, the Army's first woman to earn three stars, complained
informally to her superiors at the time the incident is alleged to
have occurred, but filed a formal complaint with the inspector
general only after the Army announced last Aug. 27 that Smith would
be appointed deputy, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith, whose identity had not previously been disclosed in
connection with the investigation, did not respond to a request
through the Army to comment on the accusation against him.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear whether any of the Army's top leaders knew about
the informal complaint _ which, the officials said, Kennedy had
assumed would hurt Smith's chances for advancement _ when they
chose him for the new assignment. Army Secretary Louis Caldera and
the chief of staff, Gen. Eric K. Shinseki, both declined through
spokesmen to comment on the investigation or the appointment.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior Army official said that since Kennedy had
originally handled her complaint informally, her grievance had very
likely not ended up in Smith's records as a red flag that would
have derailed consideration of a new assignment or promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this case was handled informally, it would not have been
made a part of the officer's permanent record,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation of Kennedy's accusation has roiled the Army
and left its leaders in a difficult position. They can either
dismiss her account as unfounded or confirm it and mete out
punishment to another senior officer. That choice follows a number
of sex scandals that the Army has endured in recent years, from the
rape and assault cases at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland
in 1996 to the recent demotions of two major generals found to have
had affairs with the wives of subordinate officers.
</P>
<P>
   One of those punished officers, Maj. Gen. David R.E. Hale, had
also been appointed deputy inspector general, in 1997. Hale served
in that post four months before he was allowed by the Army to
retire quietly, having been made the target of a complaint brought
by the wife of a colonel who had worked for him. The Army
eventually calling him out of retirement, charged him with 17
counts of misconduct and, after he had pleaded guilty to eight of
them, demoted him one rank.
</P>
<P>
   Kennedy's case has taken on particular significance, in part
because the accused officer is also a general but also because of
her prominence as one of only three women currently in the armed
services who have reached three-star rank. Her steady and highly
publicized rise has often been cited as a model of women's
expanding role in the military.
</P>
<P>
   The inquiry became publicly known last week, although the
identity of the general being investigated was not then known. Army
officials have repeatedly declined to discuss the matter, saying
they intend to protect the privacy of those involved and the
integrity of the inquiry. This week the Army's chief of public
affairs, Maj. Gen. John G. Meyer Jr., sent an electronic message to
all the service's generals telling them not to discuss the case
with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Since the investigation became public last week, Kennedy has
declined to comment and, associates say, has not discussed the
accusation even among friends.
</P>
<P>
   But four senior officials familiar with the case identified
Smith as the accused officer.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's inspector general, Lt. Gen. Michael W. Ackerman, has
been allowed to conduct the investigation, since Smith had not yet
begun serving as his deputy when the complaint was filed.
</P>
<P>
   But the office of the Pentagon's inspector general is overseeing
the Army's investigation, because of the senior ranks of those
involved. A senior Defense Department official said the Army,
having conducted its inquiry, might turn over any decision on
punishment to the Pentagon's inspector general.
</P>
<P>
   Smith joined the Army in 1966 and steadily rose through its
cavalry and armored ranks, serving three tours in Vietnam as a
cavalry officer. He has a bachelor's degree in history and
political science from Western Kentucky University and a master's
degree in industrial management from the University of Alabama that
he received after his last tour in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   He became a major general on Nov. 1, 1996, around the time
Kennedy has said he made an inappropriate advance in her office. At
the time, he was serving as the manager of the Saudi Arabian
National Guard Modernization Program, which has provided training
and equipment to elite Saudi forces since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Kennedy held the same rank as Smith, wearing two stars
in her position as the Army's assistant deputy chief of staff for
intelligence. She was promoted to lieutenant general the next year.
</P>
<P>
   When he was appointed deputy inspector general, Smith was
serving as commander of the U.S. Army Security Assistance Command,
a part of the Army's Materiel Command that works with the State
Department managing sales of Army equipment to foreign countries.
Since last November, the service has had him in an interim position
as special assistant to the director of the Army staff, while he
awaits the outcome of the inspector general's investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Kennedy's accusation remain unclear, although
officials have described the encounter in her office as a fleeting
one that evidently did not recur.
</P>
<P>
   One person familiar with the accusation said that by Kennedy's
account, Smith made an unwanted overture that involved brief
physical contact.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Kennedy chose not to file a formal complaint. ``All
sides wanted to handle this informally,'' one senior Army official
said. ``That's what you'd like to do to avoid ruining someone's
career.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army chief of staff at the time, Gen. Dennis J. Reimer, said
last week that he never knew of Kennedy's complaint against another
officer. The vice chief of staff then, Gen. Robert H. Griffith,
said Wednesday that he, too, had been unaware of any incident. He
added that if Kennedy had brought the encounter to his attention
then, he would have pursued an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The system takes allegations very, very seriously,'' Griffith
said.
</P>
<P>
   Changing her mind, Kennedy filed a formal complaint last year
because Smith's new position could involve investigating complaints
like hers against him, according to an Army official familiar with
her accusation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Gates had business before all three branches
of government on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the morning, Gates _ the founder of the Microsoft Corp. and
still considered the world's richest man despite the battering his
company's stock has taken lately _ met with lawmakers on both sides
of the Capitol, where he expressed confidence that his company
would overturn a federal judge's ruling this week that Microsoft
had violated the nation's antitrust laws.
</P>
<P>
   In the afternoon, at a White House conference on the new
economy, he sat side by side with President Clinton, whose
administration had taken him to court. He stuck to the president's
agenda _ how to spread technology to the poor _ and studiously
avoided any mention of the court case.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're invited to a forum on global warming, you don't talk
about saving the Social Security trust fund,'' explained Ginny
Terzano, a Microsoft spokeswoman. ``It would have been
inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates also had some business at Washington's federal courthouse,
but it wasn't on his itinerary. Microsoft's lawyers appeared before
U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson, who ruled against
Microsoft on Monday. Jackson set a May 24 hearing on sanctions
against the company.
</P>
<P>
   Gates' visit to Washington showed the many sides of the man.
</P>
<P>
   In court documents filed by the Justice Department, he is
portrayed as a ruthless monopolist who built his own wealth at the
expense of the marketplace. Clinton, however, invited him to the
White House to highlight his philanthropic efforts through the Bill
and Melinda Gates Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers, meanwhile, were aware of his growing political clout.
Microsoft topped the list of computer industry contributors to
political campaigns last year, according to the Center for
Responsive Politics, with $1.2 million going almost equally to
Democrats and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has long preferred to focus its attention on
Washington state, where the company is based, rather than on
Washington, D.C. But the company has clearly come to realize the
necessity of operating on both coasts.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's version of ``Gates goes to Washington'' began about
9:15 a.m. In four back-to-back meetings with adoring House and
Senate Democrats and Republicans, Gates was treated neither as a
victim nor a villain, but as a national treasure whose fate in the
courts has yet to play out.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was treated like an icon of the New Economy,'' said Rep.
Norman Dicks, D-Wash., who set up Gates' meeting with about 50
House Democrats. ``People are willing to wait and see how the
lawsuit plays out. The sentiment was that members would like this
to settle.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates has plenty of detractors, especially in the Silicon Valley
districts that are home to Microsoft's chief competitors. But the
naysayers were nowhere to be found on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very upset and disappointed by the court decision,''
said Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., who arranged Gates' meeting with
about 60 House Republicans. ``He was encouraged by our members to
hang in there and never, never give up. He said he believes he'll
win on appeal.''
</P>
<P>
   In a wide-ranging discussion with about a dozen Senate
Democrats, Gates covered subjects from education to health care to
the global economy, and the roles industry and Congress play.
</P>
<P>
   Next stop was an hour with House Republicans, where Gates, after
brief introductory remarks that did not touch on the court
decision, forecast a technological future in which even
technology-shy lawmakers would carry their daily schedules in a
tablet device, and the Internet would be a staple of work and
personal lives.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, before House Democrats who are trying to burnish
their image with the high-tech community, Gates fielded questions
about the so-called digital divide between those enjoying the
wealth and advantages that flow from access to computers and the
Internet versus those who may be left behind in the race to improve
their lives. He also put in a plug for high-tech industries' need
for more H-1B visas for software specialists and other technical
workers, a measure that's now pending in both the House and the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   When one Democrat groused that the booming economy had bypassed
his district, leaving some highly qualified engineers unemployed,
Gates insisted the legislator send him their resumes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of tapping into Gates' software expertise, White House
officials invited him to the conference because of his
philanthropic efforts. He participated in a panel discussion on how
best to bring health, education and technology to poor people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The work he's doing around the world, we have admiration
for,'' said a senior White House official. ``As far as the company
and its practices, we had a problem with that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates was able to make a similar distinction. His aides say he
considers the Justice Department to be the entity pushing the
lawsuit, not the White House. He also keeps in mind, they said,
that the federal government is one of Microsoft's largest clients.
</P>
<P>
   But there was clearly a bit of angst on both sides before Gates
arrived at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   After the court ruling this week, John Podesta, the White House
chief of staff, checked with Joel Klein, the assistant attorney
general in charge of the antitrust division, to determine whether
Gates' participation in the White House was appropriate. No
objection was lodged.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Gates also called the White House after the ruling to
determine whether Gates' invitation, which was issued a month ago,
was still valid. It was.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't appear to be awkward in any way,'' Trevor Neilson, a
spokesman for the Gates Foundation, said of the White House visit.
</P>
<P>
   And despite Gates' warnings about what effect government
meddling would have on his company, he sounded positive about the
future, sanctions or no sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the beginning of what the computer can do to change
our lives,'' he said at the White House. ``The best is yet to
come.''

 &HT;    Hewitt: `It's the right situation'
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The task of turning around the Georgia Tech basketball
program falls to a young coach most Yellow Jackets fans probably
had not heard of before Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hewitt of Siena College was expected to be approved
Wednesday night by the board of the school's athletic association.
If so, he was to be introduced formally today as the 12th coach in
Georgia Tech history.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, 36, led Siena to a 66-27 record in three seasons at the
school in Loudonville, N.Y. The Saints were in the NCAA Tournament
in 1999 and the NIT this season.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt was offered the job Wednesday morning by athletics
director Dave Braine. Terms of the contract were not disclosed, but
it is thought to be a four- or five-year deal worth about $500,000
annually, including money from radio and TV shows, camps and shoe
deals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm excited,'' Braine said. ``Paul fits the criteria we were
looking for when we set out to hire a coach. He has an excellent
record. He is a good teacher who is able to develop players. And he
is a very good recruiter who is not turned off by the academic
standards we have at Tech.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt succeeds Bobby Cremins, who announced Feb. 18 that he
would not return after 19 seasons. Cremins compiled a 354-237
record, including 13-17 this season. Tech missed the NCAA
Tournament six of the past seven seasons, and interest and
attendance lagged.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who last year turned down an offer from Pittsburgh and
interviewed for the Notre Dame job, was scheduled to be introduced
at a news conference at 11 a.m. today.
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't because it's a matter of time for leaving Siena.
It's because this is the right situation,'' Hewitt said from New
York Wednesday before heading to Atlanta. ``There are one or two
schools I would go to, this happens to be one of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Braine headed a search committee that reported to the full
board. He had discussions with several coaches, including
Appalachian State's Buzz Peterson, Oliver Purnell of Dayton,
Tulsa's Bill Self and Mike Brey of Delaware.
</P>
<P>
   Braine insisted that Hewitt was not a consolation pick.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is the first choice,'' Braine said. ``He is the only one
who has been offered the job, and in no way is Paul some fourth or
fifth choice. Finding a coach who fit our search criteria was of
the utmost importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Tech fans expressed dissatisfaction via Internet chat rooms
with the selection of a coach from a mid-major program without a
high profile, and some board members were lobbied to nix the deal.
</P>
<P>
   But Braine said he was not aware of such sentiments.
</P>
<P>
   ``If that is the case, I haven't heard about it,'' Braine said.
``When Dean Smith was hired at North Carolina, nobody knew who he
was. Three or four years ago, most fans didn't know who Billy
Donovan or Tom Izzo was.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have hired one of the very best and brightest coaches in
the country who came highly recommended.''
</P>
<P>
   Others agree, including George Raveling, who hired Hewitt as a
graduate assistant in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the Final Four ... when the conversation got around to
young coaches,'' Raveling said. ``We all shared the thought that
the two brightest young coaches around were Paul and Tommy Amaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is certainly in the small cluster of young coaches who can
become a Mike Krzyzewski, a Lute Olson, a John Chaney or John
Thompson. Paul goes about things in subtle ways but gets things
done.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt's immediate concern will be recruiting, with the spring
signing period that begins Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall, Cremins signed three players, Brendan Plavich, a
high-scoring guard from Dalton High; Halston Lane, a forward from
Oak Ridge, Tenn.; and Marvin Lewis of Baltimore, one of the top
shooting guards in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   With 7-footer Jason Collier leaving and 6-11 Alvin Jones
considering the NBA draft, adding a center and a power forward is
important.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt also must solidify his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Cantwell, Cremins' longtime aide, wants to seek a
head-coaching job, and Mark Price's plans are uncertain. Willie
Reese, who has held the program together since the season ended,
would like to stay.

 &HT;    Hewitt resume: X's, O's, superb people skills
 &HT;    By J.C. Clemons
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Any criticism of the hiring of Paul Hewitt, chosen
Wednesday as Georgia Tech basketball coach, is not new to the man.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, when Hewitt was hired at Siena College, some
people predicted that he was in over his head.
</P>
<P>
   An Albany, N.Y., newspaper columnist wrote: ``Hewitt has been
the top assistant at Villanova. For all of one year. At 33, his
experience at running a program consists of a 1985-88 stint as the
head junior-varsity coach at Westbury High School on Long
Island.... Siena deserves better. Groveling in front of assistants
from big-time programs is not the way to get Siena back on its
feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Hewitt _ who beat out Ron Jirsa, then a Georgia assistant,
to gain the Saints job _ revived a program that had won only 23
games the previous three years at the 2,300-student Jesuit school.
</P>
<P>
   Associates say Hewitt is positioned to do it again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did a great job for me,'' Villanova coach Steve Lappas said
Wednesday, ``and he did wonders at Siena. With all Georgia Tech has
to offer _ a good school, in a great city and outstanding
conference _ there's no reason to believe Paul won't be successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul is a very good communicator. He will relate well to the
kids, with professors and the community. It's a great hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Southern Cal coach George Raveling, who works for Nike,
is effusive in complimenting Hewitt, who served one season as his
graduate assistant at Southern Cal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Paul's quiet and reserved but very, very bright,'' Raveling
said. ``He is an excellent coach who is a players' coach but is
able to get close to them without having to sacrifice his authority
or leadership philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just has great people skills. The high school coaches in
the state, and the Atlanta community, will embrace him. You have to
work hard not to like Paul Hewitt.''
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt, who attended high school on Long Island, always has made
education a priority. He earned an undergraduate degree in
journalism and economics from St. John Fisher College, a highly
rated private school in Rochester, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He has emphasized education at Siena, and the class he signed
for next season averaged nearly 1,100 on the SAT.
</P>
<P>
   Hewitt also is a good promoter. He used a fast-paced offensive
attack and relentless defensive pressure to help boost Siena's
attendance to a record 7,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it's Hewitt the person that people rave about.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told (athletics director) Dave (Braine), you will never have
any problems with Paul,'' Raveling said. ``He will never lie to
you, and he will never resort to cheating. He's a fine young man.''

KHANNOUCHI: NO CITIZENSHIP, NO MARATHON TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By JERE LONGMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The world record-holder Khalid Khannouchi said Wednesday that he
would not participate in the U.S. Olympic marathon trials on May 7
unless he receives citizenship in the next few days. According to
his Houston-based lawyer, Harry Gee, Khannouchi would not get his
citizenship that quickly because the marathoner had not been
persistent enough to complete the already expedited process.
</P>
<P>
   The Moroccan native said that he would consider trying to make
the American team at 5,000 or 10,000 meters if he received his
citizenship before the Olympic track-and-field trials, which are
scheduled July 14-23 in Sacramento.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Track and Field Federation said it would allow
Khannouchi to participate in the marathon trials in Pittsburgh if
it received an official notice from the Immigration and
Naturalization Service saying that he would be sworn in as a
citizen before the Summer Olympics in September in Sydney,
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   However, Khannouchi said he was sensitive to criticism from some
American runners, who do not believe he should compete in the
trials if he was not yet a U.S. citizen. Another complicating
factor is the London Marathon, which Khannouchi is scheduled to run
on April 16 for a six-figure payday.
</P>
<P>
   His contract stipulates that he can withdraw from London up to a
week before the race if he received his American citizenship,
Khannouchi said. That cutoff date would be Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   If he runs London, he said he would not run the American trials
three weeks later, despite previous speculation by friends who said
that he would consider it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It isn't logical to do two marathons in three weeks,''
Khannouchi said in a telephone interview from Madrid, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sandra Khannouchi, said on March 29 the couple had
filed papers with the INS office in Houston seeking to expedite
Khalid Khannouchi's citizenship under a provision that speeds up
the naturalization process if a spouse has an overseas job with an
American company. This provision, most often used by the military,
was used to secure American citizenship for the French soccer
player David Regis in time for the 1998 World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, Sandra Khannouchi said, she has been working
in Madrid as a recruiter and promoter for Elite Racing Inc., an
American firm that puts on events such as the Rock-'n'-Roll
Marathon in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Gee said there was an 80 percent chance that Khannouchi would
have received his citizenship under the spousal-job provision by
the May 3 entry date for the U.S. marathon trials if the runner had
set a higher priority for naturalization.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Gee said, Khannouchi was scheduled to be
fingerprinted in Houston Wednesday, and the fingerprints were to be
submitted to the INS in a meeting Thursday. However, Khannouchi is
out of the country. ``We could get it done if he'd get over here,''
Gee said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, who is working on the case without pay, said he was
unaware that Khannouchi was scheduled to run the London Marathon,
and that he would skip the American trials if he did, until
informed Wednesday by a reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hasn't been smart,'' Gee said of Khannouchi. ``He
definitely should have shared what his goals and objectives might
be. We thought eligibility for the Olympics was his top priority.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the London payday, Gee said, ``It sounds like he
took a bird in hand.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though he could run the marathon trials without being a
citizen, Khannouchi said he would not. He said that he had been
stung by criticism from other American marathoners, including Keith
Brantly, a 1996 Olympian.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will never go to the trials if I am not an American
citizen,'' Khannouchi said. ``It doesn't feel right. I don't want
them to see me as a foreigner. It will damage my reputation. There
will be too much controversy. I am not doing it to make money. I am
doing it to promote the sport and to give something back to the
country that supported me.''
</P>
<P>
   Khannouchi, who lives in Ossining, N.Y., and who set the world
record of 2 hours 5 minutes 42 seconds at the 1999 Chicago
Marathon, came to the United States in 1993 to participate in the
World University Games. Unhappy with his support from the Moroccan
track federation, he moved to Brooklyn, married Sandra Natal, a
naturalized American, and applied for American citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   His case was frozen when the INS agent who interviewed him was
accused of taking bribes and left the agency. Because he did not
become a permanent U.S. resident until 1998, Khannouchi would not
be eligible for citizenship on the basis of marrying an American
until 2001. That is why he is using the special spousal-job
provision.
</P>
<P>
   He would be the favorite in the Olympic marathon, but he would
face stiff competition for a medal at 5,000 and 10,000 meters,
where his best times, 13:24 and 27:45, respectively, have been run
on the road.
</P>
<P>
   He would also need permission from Morocco to compete in the
Sydney Olympics, but Moroccan track officials have said they would
not interfere. (JT)  &QL;

NO ONE SHOULD GET COMPLACENT ABOUT JOB

<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The company said a couple of months ago that
it no longer could compete with other publications unless it
reduced the expenses of the business news desk. It will cut costs
by ``outsourcing'' the desk, turning operations over to outside
contractors.
</P>
<P>
   We business writers and editors, many of us with 15, 20, even 25
years of experience, were told we would be laid off. Reporters were
told they could reapply with an organization that had been
contracted to manage reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The company said editors could buy, at a nominal monthly cost,
their computers, telephones and other tools of the trade, but
they'd have to work as free-lancers after applying to an
independent contractor hired to manage them.
</P>
<P>
   The scenario, of course, is a metaphor. We still have our jobs _
for now. Other workers do not. Hundreds of workers in Kansas City
and Springfield have been hit with that kind of change.
</P>
<P>
   The current wrangle between Associated Wholesale Grocers and the
Teamsters union is worth heeding, no matter how you view contract
disputes between organized labor and owners. Even if you feel
immune in a nonunion, ``merit-based,'' white-collar world, the
scenario should shake any job-related complacency you may have.
</P>
<P>
   Outsourcing. Re-engineering. Reorganizing. Downsizing.
Rightsizing. Layoffs. Whatever the label, workers lose jobs all the
time, and not necessarily through performance faults of their own.
Owners across industries make staffing changes they think they need
to make to compete and increase profits. The changes often
eliminate or greatly alter jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it's possible to pin this kind of job loss on
intractable union leadership that fails to negotiate in the best
interests of its membership. Sometimes it's the fault of bad-faith
bargaining by owners. Sometimes it's about mutual failure to change
us vs. them cultures of entitlement into cultures of shared
responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   It's always about economic reality. Those who control the assets
can, as they always have, allocate them as they please. That's why
collective bargaining grew to protect workers. That's also partly
why the power of unions has waned.
</P>
<P>
   But don't pass off the conflict between Associated and the
Teamsters as a clash of workplace dinosaurs who would rather claw
each other to death than communicate. The next job loss you hear
about might not be because of a declared impasse in union
negotiations. It might be any owner's choice to increase
``competitive efficiencies'' as he or she sees fit.
</P>
<P>
   A Teamster on the picket line said he felt betrayed and bitter.
Anyone who has ignored or felt insulated from this inexorable sweep
of change would feel the same way.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention to the hallmarks of Generations X and Y: loyalty
to no employer and focus on self-directed careers. Younger workers
understand inexorable change, the demand for adaptability and
self-responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   They know there is no job security, no entitlement in exchange
for service, no corporate or union cocoon, no tenure or benefit
plan that provides fail-safe job protection. Dinosaurs they are
not.

WAREHOUSE ONE REWARDS OWNER AS IT GATHERS AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILIAN MINCER  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Mary Lou Jacoby's philosophy is simple: If
you're handed lemons, it's time to make lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love a challenge,'' said Jacoby, president and chief
executive of Warehouse One. Her company sells, recycles, trades and
reconditions warehouse, retail and office equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Where many people would have seen mountains of junk, unskilled
workers and a dilapidated building, Jacoby saw potential.
</P>
<P>
   She started on a shoestring budget in 1986 when she bought a
building at 33rd Street and Forest Avenue filled with surplus
factory seconds and used merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   A year later, Jacoby got the opportunity to haul away in one
weekend everything left over as Macy's closed its downtown store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know I knew so many people with pickup trucks,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Warehouse One has about 60 employees at its
400,000-square-foot warehouse near Interstates 435 and 70.
</P>
<P>
   Sales have climbed about 30 percent each year, to $6.6 million
in 1999. About 21 percent of that business is in Kansas City, 23
percent is within 150 miles and the remainder is national.
</P>
<P>
   Working Woman magazine recently named Warehouse One a regional
winner in its second annual Working Woman Entrepreneurial
Excellence Awards.
</P>
<P>
   A pink sign hangs at the entrance of the company's headquarters,
a building that is gradually being renovated. The pink is
intentional.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed something to differentiate ourselves from the rest
of the companies in our business,'' said Jacoby, who was wearing a
trademark pink blazer one day last week. ``It seemed logical that
one of the differences was that I am female. Rather than a
negative, I thought it was a positive. The pink represents the fact
that we are unique and very human. We're very concerned about the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby offers two employees a ride as she drives her pink golf
cart through the huge warehouse.
</P>
<P>
   The millions of items include mountains of light fixtures,
conveyor belts and shelving, as well as rooms of new and
reconditioned office furniture.
</P>
<P>
   The primary source of this stock is Fortune 500 companies that
are downsizing, moving or upgrading their warehousing operations,
offices or retail locations. Supplies also come from growing and
expanding small businesses.
</P>
<P>
   Then there are the unique items she has discovered over the
years, such as the Santa Claus that had been at the downtown Macy's
department store.
</P>
<P>
   Many of her clients are small and midsize businesses seeking
quality items at discounted prices. Customers include Fortune 500
companies that are Warehouse One suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortune 500 companies are learning the economics of buying
reconditioned or used equipment,'' Jacoby said.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Keefer, warehouse manager at the Westlake Ace Hardware
distribution center in Lenexa, Kan., said his company selected
Warehouse One because of ``the price and the products they had.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the stuff we bought was brand new,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby said many of her clients were repeat customers who trade
in equipment when they are ready to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The next step is e-commerce. Already, the Internet is making
sales much easier because clients can view products and place an
order within minutes.
</P>
<P>
   While Jacoby is proud of the company's growth, she is also proud
of the effect the business has had on its employees, the
neighborhood and the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company was honored by the Missouri Waste Control
Coalition for its commitment to waste conservation, recycling and
disposal.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, Warehouse One recycled 9 million tons of surplus,
overstock, industry seconds and outdated equipment. It expects that
number to increase to more than 13 million tons in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The Initiative for Competitive Inner City also selected
Warehouse One as one of its ``Inner City Top 100'' in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always accepted our inner-city location as an advantage,''
Jacoby said. ``The part of the city we're in has a population that
has a good work ethic; people want to work.''
</P>
<P>
   More than half the employees come from the immediate
neighborhood, and many do not have a high school degree. But more
than 60 percent have been with the company at least five years.
</P>
<P>
   Jacoby attributes the longevity to the family atmosphere. It's a
place where on Fridays the youngest member of the staff, Jacoby's
grandson Sterling Boone, takes lunch orders.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good fit for the type of business we are,'' Jacoby
said. ``We recycle stuff, we recycle people, we recycle property.''

LAWYER SAYS ELIAN'S FATHER IS HEADED TO THE U.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   By NEIL A. LEWIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The father of Elian Gonzalez will travel to the
United States from Cuba on Thursday morning to reclaim his son, a
lawyer for the boy's father announced Wednesday night after
returning from Havana.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement sets the stage for a final legal showdown over
the boy, who has been in the custody of relatives in Miami since he
was rescued clinging to a rubber inner tube in November.
</P>
<P>
   Gregory Craig, the Washington lawyer who represents Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, the boy's father, told reporters that he expected
Attorney General Janet Reno and the Doris Meissner, the
commissioner of immigration, ``to take immediate action aimed at
reuniting Elian with his father.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig, who traveled to Havana Wednesday night to consult with
Gonzalez and Cuban government officials, said that the father, his
new wife and 6-month-old baby will arrive in Washington Thursday
morning. His comments suggest that he was able to persuade Cuban
authorities to allow the father to come to the United States even
though the State Department had not provided visas for all 27
people the Cuban government wanted to accompany Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   ``Juan Miguel has now been separated from his 6-year-old son for
over four months,'' Craig said in a statement read to reporters in
front of his office building in downtown Washington Wednesday
night. ``This separation occurred through no fault of his own and
has continued against his wishes. It is time for the reunion to go
forward and he has come here and is prepared to stay here until he
has achieved that objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton administration officials, who have said they want to
reunite the boy with his father, have hoped for Gonzalez to come
here to help strengthen the case against the Miami relatives, who
have been taking care of Elian and insist the boy should remain in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``For many weeks, people have asked why the father has not come
to the United States to take custody of his son,'' Craig said.
``For just as many weeks, Juan Miguel has stated that he would
happily travel to the United States and was fully prepared to do so
if he could be assured that, when he came here, he would in fact be
given custody of his son.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig said that he and the father were now both satisfied that
the immigration service would immediately begin to transfer legal
custody of the boy from his great uncle Lazaro Gonzalez, who has
cared for him in the Little Havana section of Miami, to the father.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials said that could take place as soon as Thursday. A
physical transfer of custody would occur soon after, the officials
have said.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department has granted special visitors visas to
Gonzalez and five others. But the Cuban government has asked that
22 others be allowed to come, including Ricardo Alarcon, the
speaker of the national assembly and a robust critic of the United
States government.
</P>
<P>
   James P. Rubin, the State Department spokesman, said Wednesday
that officials believed that ``the six visas we have provided are
sufficient to provide an environment appropriate for the child in
this case.''
</P>
<P>
   Discussions between Justice Department officials and Elian's
relatives in Miami were expected to resume on Thursday morning at
the offices of the chief federal prosecutor in the Miami area.
Justice Department officials have insisted that the only issue open
for discussion is how the family will surrender Elian to the
father. The relatives are still arguing for ways to keep custody of
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, many Cuban-Americans in the Miami area have
been conducting regular demonstrations outside the home where Elian
is staying, vowing they would not allow federal officials to take
the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Elian was rescued in the Atlantic off Florida on Thanksgiving
Day. His mother was among 10 people who died after their boat sank
while crossing from Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a great tragedy when a young child loses a parent as
Elian did during his trip to the United States,'' Craig said. ``But
it is an equal tragedy for any parent to face the loss of a young
child.'' (JT) &QR;

SCIENTIFIC PANEL URGES TIGHTER REGULATION OF GENETICALLY ALTERED
CROPS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT CANON  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The genetically modified crops that feed
virtually every American need stricter regulation to prevent harm
to food safety and to the planet, a scientific panel said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists stressed that they had no evidence yet of ill
effects from the designer corn and other crops that have fast taken
over much of the country's farm fields.
</P>
<P>
   They also noted that the crops _ plants crafted in laboratories
to resist insects _ also reduce farmers' chemical use.
</P>
<P>
   And the panel found no sound scientific distinction between the
dangers of the genetic engineering that has been in commercial
fields for five years and the century-long practice of conventional
plant breeding.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the study by the National Research Council concluded that
genetically modified crops were a radically new technology with
still-unknown consequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a potential for undesirable effects,'' the report
said.
</P>
<P>
   That warning came less than a week after a federal agency
released a survey suggesting that farmers might be planting less of
the popular crops this year.
</P>
<P>
   The panel, a group assembled by the National Academy of
Sciences, called for more research to determine whether
transplanting genes could significantly increase the chance of
allergies or promote the mutation of pesticide-resistant bugs or
nearly indestructible weeds.
</P>
<P>
   With biotechnology growing in practice and controversy _
Europeans, for instance, have tried to ban the importation of
biotech products _ advocates on both sides found something in the
report to crow about.
</P>
<P>
   ``It supports the case that there are risks with transgenic
crops, that the risks need to be regulated and that the regulation
is too weak,'' said Margaret Mellon, a molecular biologist and
lawyer who tracks the debate for the Union of Concerned Scientists.
</P>
<P>
   Her organization is among those that worry that plant
biotechnology represents the opening of a biological Pandora's box
that could unleash health and environmental disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The biotechnology industry argues that gene-spliced crops hold
the promise of using far fewer chemicals to produce incredible
harvests that will fill supermarkets with healthier foods. It found
vindication in the report.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The) committee reached consensus that there is no evidence
that foods improved through biotechnology are unsafe,'' said Val
Giddings, a vice president at the Biotechnology Industry
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Some environmental groups criticized the makeup of the committee
because it included professors who receive grants from firms such
as Dow and Monsanto, which have invested heavily in developing
genetically modified seed. Defenders of the committee noted that
those same academics have been financed by the Union of Concerned
Scientists and the Audubon Society. They also noted that the panel
was balanced, with both boosters and critics of genetically
modified crops.
</P>
<P>
   The report was delivered amid an uncertain future for
biotechnology. First available on a large scale in 1996, the
technology accounted for the majority of acres planted among
several major crops in the United States last year.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this year, reflecting increasing disdain in foreign markets,
farmers appear to be backing away from biotechnology for the first
time. The Department of Agriculture released a survey Friday
indicating that growers planned to scale back slightly the planting
of genetically modified cotton and soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   The same survey showed that corn farmers planned to roll back by
24 percent _ from 25 percent of their acres last year to 19 percent
this year _ the planting of corn genetically modified to contain
the natural pesticide bacillus thuringiensis. The bug killer makes
the stalk toxic to the European corn borer and has long been a
favorite of organic farmers.
</P>
<P>
   A recent laboratory study coated milkweed leaves with heavy
doses of pollen from so-called Bt corn. Monarch caterpillars who
feasted on the leaves died. That fed concerns that biotechnology
could backfire by harming the wrong insects.
</P>
<P>
   In their study released Wednesday, the scientists concluded that
too few studies had been conducted to guarantee that the crops
wouldn't mate with weedy cousins, spawn generations of insects
impervious to relatively environment-friendly sprays or spur
allergies or other dangerous reactions in people who consume the
products.
</P>
<P>
   To make matters worse, the report said, the crops fall under
regulation by the Food and Drug Administration, the Environmental
Protection Agency and the Department of Agriculture. The three
agencies have overlapping duties that sometimes make it hard to
determine who has investigated what, the committee found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quantity, quality and public accessibility of
information...should be expanded,'' the study said.
</P>
<P>
   The report also singled out the EPA for criticism. For example,
the committee said the agency should give thorough study to plants
made by mixing the genes of two sexually compatible plants _ such
as when the DNA from one tomato is placed artificially in another.
</P>
<P>
   It also called for the EPA to move forward on tighter regulation
of seed already being planted.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the EPA wants seed companies to require farmers
planting Bt corn to put 20 percent of their acreage in conventional
varieties. In theory, that would reduce the chances of a super
insect evolving that could resist the natural insecticide. Today,
because the regulation is technically ``proposed,'' it's unclear
whether the agency could enforce the provision.
</P>
<P>
   ``This endorses the EPA role in regulating these crops,'' said
Rebecca Goldburg, a senior scientist at Environmental Defense and a
member of the committee. ``This should push that forward.''

A FEDERAL JUDGE MAKES USE OF AN OBSCURE RULE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Also see MICROSOFT-ANTITRUST) 
 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Stung after a major reversal by his superiors on
the appeals court on a central issue in the Microsoft antitrust
case nearly two years ago, Federal District Judge Thomas Penfield
Jackson has responded in kind this week.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Jackson took the unusual path of rebuking the appeals
court, casting aside its reasoning as ``not formally binding'' and
rebuking them for failing to follow the Supreme Court precedents
``in at least three respects.''
</P>
<P>
   The appeals court had found that Jackson was wrong on the law
when he ordered Microsoft to immediately unbundle its Windows
operating system and its Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   By Tuesday, the tactical thinking behind Jackson's unusual
criticism became clear. Reminding lawyers at a status meeting in
his chambers of an obscure appeals rule, he indicated he would help
government lawyers to bypass the United States Court of Appeals
entirely and take any appeals by Microsoft directly to the Supreme
Court.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the Antitrust Expediting Act, the rule gives a federal
district judge the power to certify any final judgment in a civil
lawsuit brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act to be ripe for
immediate review by the Supreme Court if the appeal ``is of general
public importance to the administration of justice.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule is now rarely invoked. But it could shave a year or
more off of the appeals that Microsoft has already vowed to pursue,
a significant amount of time in a rapidly changing industry. Both
Jackson and the government's lawyers have said they want the case
resolved before the issues become moot.
</P>
<P>
   The expediting act, thus, enables the government to circumvent
an appeals court that has already handed a significant defeat to
the government by overturning a Microsoft decision by Jackson and,
with the same reasoning, could do it again. It would permit the
case to be put on the Supreme Court docket as early as next term,
which begins in October.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of its promise in moving the two-year-old case along
to a speedier conclusion, it is far from certain whether any
Microsoft appeals will ultimately be expedited. While many lawyers
expect that the Justice Department will ultimately seek to put the
appeals on a fast track, officials in both the antitrust division
and solicitor general's office said Wednesday that no decision had
been made about whether to accept Jackson's invitation, and that
none would be announced before the completion of the remedies phase
of the case this summer.
</P>
<P>
   And even if the government seeks an expedited appeal, the
Supreme Court cannot hear the case unless four justices vote to put
it on the calendar. Experts in appellate procedure said it would be
a marked departure for the court to take the Microsoft case
directly if it presented a long laundry list of appeals issues.
</P>
<P>
   But they said that it was impossible to know whether the
justices would be willing to review Jackson's work rather than send
it back to the appeals court first to narrow some of the issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's certainly possible the justices would take the case, but
it would be a challenge for them to deal with such a voluminous
record,'' said Mark Levy, a former official at the Justice
Department involved in appellate litigation and now in private
practice.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision on Monday, the judge concluded that the company
violated Section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act by bundling its
Windows operating system software with its Internet Explorer
browser. Two years ago, a federal appeals panel found that the
bundling did not appear to violate Section 1 and reversed an
injunction by Jackson that had ordered the company to separate the
two software packages.
</P>
<P>
   The judge replied in his opinion that the appeals court's
decision was ``inconsistent with the pertinent Supreme Court
precedents'' and ``not formally binding.''
</P>
<P>
   For most of the century, all final judgments in civil antitrust
suits brought under the Sherman Antitrust Act would automatically
go directly from the district court to the Supreme Court. But
Congress changed the law in 1978, making expedited appeals
discretionary.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the rule has been used sparingly. It was used twice
by the government in the AT&AMP;T antitrust case heard by Federal
District Judge Harold H. Greene. In both cases, the Supreme Court
accepted the appeals and then summarily upheld Greene without
hearing any arguments on the merits. &QL;

PENN.   PRIMARIES PUT FOCUS ON CONGRESSIONAL RACES
</HEADLINE>
 By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr.  
c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   With polls showing Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush running neck-and-neck for Pennsylvania's 23 electoral
votes, the state was already one to watch in November. Now the
results from congressional primaries on Tuesday make it even more
interesting.
</P>
<P>
   More congressional races appear to be in doubt in Pennsylvania
than in most states, so the state could play a significant role in
determining which party will control the House and the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The Senate contest bids to be among the nation's hardest fought.
So do races in three congressional districts _ the 4th, 10th and
13th.
</P>
<P>
   In the Senate primary, Rep. Ron Klink, a 48-year-old moderate
Democrat from the Pittsburgh area, was nominated to take on the
Republican incumbent, Rick Santorum, 41, a conservative who is
facing his first re-election battle and had no opposition in the
primary. Klink, first elected to the House in 1992, defeated six
other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have had Santorum in their cross hairs ever since he
squeaked into office five years ago with a winning margin of just 2
percentage points. They say he is too conservative for Pennsylvania
and not collegial enough to be effective.
</P>
<P>
   Santorum has said that he was willing to stand on his record
because ``it's a good record _ I know it's a good record.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the three Pennsylvania House races that will be closely
watched this fall, the one in the 4th District to choose a
successor to Klink shapes up as the hottest.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican nominee, state Sen. Melissa Hart, faced no
primary opposition and goes into the fall contest with her treasury
intact.
</P>
<P>
   But the Democratic primary winner, state Rep. Terry Van Horne,
is not the candidate many state and national party leaders had
hoped to nominate. Their choice had been Matthew Mangino, a
district attorney from Western Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   The upset was embarrassing enough by itself for the party
leaders. But on top of that came more trouble _ a Republican
accusation on Wednesday, based on a 6-year-old newspaper clipping,
that Van Horne had once used a racial slur to describe a black
state legislator.
</P>
<P>
   According to the clipping, Van Horne subsequently ``tearfully
apologized.'' Nevertheless, Rep. Thomas Davis III, R-Va., the head
of the National Republican Congressional Committee, saw a political
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democrats woke up this morning with an unelectable
candidate with a frightening past,'' Davis said in a statement.
``I'd be surprised if most voters would want to have anything to do
with Van Horne.''
</P>
<P>
   The race in Pennsylvania's 10th Congressional District, in the
northeast corner, is a rerun of one of the closest races in the
nation in 1998. The winner of that contest, Rep. Don Sherwood, a
Republican, defeated his Democratic opponent, Pat Casey, a son of
former Gov. Robert Casey, by 515 votes. On Tuesday, Pat Casey won
the Democratic nomination a second time _ and with it a second shot
at Sherwood.
</P>
<P>
   In the 13th Congressional District, outside Philadelphia,
Republicans nominated state Sen. Stewart J. Greenleaf to face the
Democratic incumbent, Joseph Hoeffel. Hoeffel was narrowly elected
in 1998, and national Republican leaders believe Greenleaf has a
good chance defeat him this fall.

DONATIONS FROM MATTRESS MAKER FOLLOW SENATOR'S ACTION

<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Just three months after state Sen. Bill
Kenney pushed through legislation sought by the bedding industry,
Missouri's largest bed-springs maker began cutting checks totaling
$100,000 to Kenney's campaign for lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   The money from Leggett &AMP; Platt Inc. _ four $25,000 checks
written in August and September _ represent 43 percent of all
contributions Kenney took in last year, campaign finance records
show. The first check was received Aug. 28, the day the new law
took effect.
</P>
<P>
   Both Kenney and a spokesman for Carthage-based Leggett &AMP; Platt
denied any connection between the contributions and the
legislation, which requires large warning labels on refurbished
mattresses.
</P>
<P>
   But critics said the sequence of events was troubling. Sen. Joe
Maxwell, who is seeking the Democratic nomination for lieutenant
governor, said a contribution of $100,000 from a single supporter
created undue influence no matter how Kenney explained his actions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no evidence that there was a quid pro quo,'' Maxwell
said. ``But it raises questions about improprieties and whether a
deal was cut in regards to that legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   The story of how the bedding bill became law provides a long
look at the legislative process, the influence of lobbyists and the
effect of limitless campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney, a Lee's Summit Republican, said he maneuvered the
bedding provision into law to protect consumers from unscrupulous
mattress sellers, especially those who prey on low-income residents
of inner cities.
</P>
<P>
   Without the warning labels, he said, mattresses with
contaminated, bug-infested linings often are sold as new. And
buyers can suffer severe health consequences from bacteria and
fungi embedded in the mattress, Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Kenney said he owned ``a few thousand shares'' of
Leggett &AMP; Platt stock, he said he never considered how the
legislation might help the company, which sells nearly $2 billion
of new-mattress and other furniture components every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone wants to sell shoddy, used, urinated, bed-stained
mattresses and cover them with fabric (and sell them as new), I'm
saying, `You can't do that,' '' Kenney said. ``I don't want the
consumer buying something that they think is something else.''
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Health staff, however, recommended the
governor veto the bill, contending that it sought to fix a
nonexistent problem and created a regulatory nightmare for the
state. Pam Walker, director of the department's Division of
Environmental Health, said she viewed the bill as part of a turf
war between bedspring makers and recyclers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coil makers are the ones who benefit financially from this
(new law) because it's the coils that get recycled,'' Walker said.
</P>
<P>
   John Cuaderes, Leggett &AMP; Platt's chief lobbyist, said the
company supported Kenney's legislation as a way to protect
consumers. But the company did not actively lobby for the measure,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Leggett &AMP; Platt, he said, made a six-figure contribution to
Kenney because of his conservative, pro-business philosophy. The
company contributed $100,000 to U.S. Rep. Jim Talent's Republican
campaign for governor for the same reason, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Kenney is a person we believe in,'' Cuaderes said. ``His
philosophy is aligned with southwest Missouri. He shares the same
beliefs we do, period. If we gave contributions because we wanted
to pass legislation, we wouldn't be giving to Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which started in 1883 as a maker of spiral steel
bedspring coils, still sells bedsprings, bed frames and foam
padding to mattress manufacturers. That division reported 1999
sales of $1.95 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said the company had supported him since he first ran for
the Senate in 1994. Campaign finance records show Leggett &AMP; Platt
executives contributed at least $4,920 to Kenney's unsuccessful run
for lieutenant governor in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   For this year's campaign, Kenney said he asked company
executives last summer for $100,000 _ and they delivered.

Originally a concession to summer's scorching heat, Casual Friday
has given way to Casual Every Day. And conventions are crumbling as
old-economy companies find themselves competing for scarce labor
against new-media enterprises run by people who take their fashion
cues from Silicon Valley, not Saville Row. Clifford Grodd,
president and chief executive at Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue
store, said of the trend, ``These companies are shooting themselves
in the foot by letting down their standards.'' (Fred R. Conrad/The

   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ ....they delivered.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said he got involved in mattress legislation in 1998
after he saw Cuaderes in the hallway at the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``John told me that (Rep.) Chuck Gross has this good bill, it
will really help consumers,'' Kenney said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross, a St. Charles Republican, had sponsored a similar bill in
1997. That bill required a refurbished mattress to contain a label
warning that it was a ``used article and sterilized.''
</P>
<P>
   Gross said he was inspired to file the bill by an episode of
``Dateline NBC'' that showed mattress refurbishers in New York that
bought mattresses that had been left on the street and in
landfills. The mattresses were re-covered, then sold as new.
</P>
<P>
   Rancid smells soon began coming from the mattresses. Tests on
reconditioned mattresses bought in New York, Maryland and
California found none had been properly sterilized, the show said.
</P>
<P>
   Gross' bill went nowhere. In 1998, Gross filed a similar
measure, and Kenney filed a Senate version. Neither reached the
Senate or House floor.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, Gross hooked up with the International Sleep Products
Association, a Virginia group that represents companies that make
new mattresses or their components. Leggett &AMP; Platt is a member.
</P>
<P>
   The association recommended changes to make the bill match model
legislation the group was pushing in several states. Kenney filed a
similar bill in the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   This time the label was to say, ``This bedding contains
previously used materials which have been cleaned and sanitized in
a reasonable manner to kill germs and insects and to prevent
infection.''
</P>
<P>
   Association Vice President Andrea Herman said the wording was
not intended to discourage sales of refurbished beds. The wording,
she said, gives consumers ``a sense of confidence that the mattress
has been cleaned and sanitized.''
</P>
<P>
   Herman estimated that 10,000 to 15,000 refurbished mattresses a
year were sold in Missouri without labels showing the mattress had
been rebuilt.
</P>
<P>
   Walker, Missouri's environmental health director, said she
viewed the labeling as overkill. The state, she said, had not
received a complaint about renovated mattresses in decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't view this as a public health threat,'' Walker said.
``We would rather see old mattresses recycled than end up in a
landfill.''
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said the labeling bill was a marketing tool for mattress
makers aimed at reducing sales of refurbished mattresses to motels.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, no one wants to check into a hotel, lift up the
sheets and tell their wife, `Honey, this thing had to be
disinfected and the bugs killed.' If you're a hotel owner, you're
not going to buy that mattress,'' Maxwell said.
</P>
<P>
   When the bill reached the Senate, however, Sen. Jerry Howard
stripped out the bedding provisions. Howard, a Dexter Democrat who
is chairman of the Senate Aging, Families and Mental Health
Committee, said the mattress issues violated the law against a bill
involving unrelated matters.
</P>
<P>
   The bill came to the Senate floor May 13, the next to last day
of the session. Kenney rose and offered an amendment to add back
the bedding provisions. Howard argued that bedding regulation was
not germane to nursing homes. A debate ensued.
</P>
<P>
   In the waning days of a legislative session, extended debate can
be a bill's death knell.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the wee hours, any time spent on a bill is critical,''
Howard said. ``Everyone is anxious their bill won't be heard.''
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the Senate chamber, Howard huddled with other
senators. He said he was told that Kenney's allies in the Senate
would continue to debate the matter unless Howard allowed the
bedding provision to go on the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Howard relented, and the bill was approved unanimously.
</P>
<P>
   In a June 3 memo, the Department of Health's Walker recommended
that the governor veto the bill. It had conflicting definitions of
bedding, the memo said. And it violated privacy rights by requiring
a refurbished mattress label to list the name and address of the
previous owner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Information required on these labels does not directly or
indirectly reflect, or have any impact on, the safety or
healthfulness of the bedding,'' the memo said.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. Mel Carnahan, however, did not want to lose the nursing
home reforms, and he signed the bill on July 13.
</P>
<P>
   Kenney said he knew that taking large checks from Leggett &AMP;
Platt would open him up to criticism. But he said it was no
different than state Treasurer Bob Holden taking contributions from
bankers or Joe Maxwell, a lawyer, taking money from trial
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns depend on money, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have said (to Leggett &AMP; Platt), `Why don't you call
the presidents of all your subsidiaries and see if they'll give me
the money?' I took the chance by taking large checks because I knew
I had never done anything wrong,'' Kenney said. ``My record's
clean.''

A THEATER OF TRADITION DEMANDING POISE TO WIN 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFTON BROWN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Of the top 60 players in the current world golf
ranking, only four have won the Masters _ Tiger Woods, Mark
O'Meara, Fred Couples and Jose Maria Olazabal.
</P>
<P>
   If you have won at Augusta National Golf Club, you belong to an
exclusive group. It is a tournament steeped in tradition, in an
atmosphere that demands poise, and is played on a course that
demands excellence. The world's best golfers have been
concentrating on this week for months, hoping to be at their best
for the 64th Masters, which begins Thursday morning. Ninety-five
players will vie for one precious green jacket, with enough
potential drama to make millions pay attention.
</P>
<P>
   Will Woods continue his recent dominance, and win his third
major tournament, at the age of 24? Will David Duval, Colin
Montgomerie or Phil Mickelson win that elusive first major? Can
Greg Norman, the sentimental favorite, finally find a happy ending
in his 20th Masters? Or will someone unexpected enjoy the thrill of
walking up the 18th fairway and into history?
</P>
<P>
   As the tournament unfolds, there will be pivotal shots and
swings in momentum. But here are some points to ponder as one of
the special events in sports gets under way.
</P>
<P>
   LONG-BALL HITTERS DON'T ALWAYS WIN _ Players talk about length
being an advantage at Augusta, but in the last 10 years, only two
power players have won: Woods (1997) and Fred Couples (1992).
Olazabal, who won both last year and in 1994, would admit that
driving is the weakest part of his game. And none of the other
winners in the 1990s _ O'Meara (1998), Nick Faldo (1990, 1996), Ben
Crenshaw (1995), Bernhard Langer (1993) and Ian Woosnam (1991) _
would win a long-driving contest among their peers .
</P>
<P>
   While length is an advantage, you can't win at Augusta without
superb distance control on approach shots, a solid short game and
excellent putting. A huge drive followed by a poor second shot will
put you in a defensive position, making Augusta's lightning-fast
greens even more treacherous. But those who consistently put their
approach shots on the proper part of the green, then capitalize by
making putts, will have a strong chance.
</P>
<P>
   The Masters has always been a thinking man's tournament, and it
continues to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to play extremely aggressive here and start firing
at flags, you'll have three-putts,'' Norman said. ``All of a sudden
your mind changes and it's hard to regroup. This is one of those
classic golf courses where you have to shoot for a target on the
green, and sometimes that target may be no more than 10 square
feet. But you have to hit that spot to putt with confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY SUCCESS IS NOT SUNDAY GLORY _ No first-round leader has
won the Masters since Crenshaw in 1984. Many players have shot one
low round at Augusta. Far fewer have put together four days good
enough to win. The tournament is mentally taxing, and the
conditions can change dramatically with the weather. Windy days at
the Masters can blow contenders off the leader board. So having the
lead Thursday is no reason to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREIGN-PLAYER FACTOR _ Eight of the last 12 Masters have
been won by non-Americans. There are 35 non-Americans in this
year's field, including two who have played well recently at
Augusta National. Darren Clarke of Northern Ireland finished fourth
in 1998, and Lee Westwood of England finished sixth last year.
</P>
<P>
   WHO IS LIKELY TO WIN? _ Surprisingly, some prominent players
have struggled at the Masters. Montgomerie, Ernie Els, Hal Sutton
and Vijay Singh have never finished in the top five. And no player
has won in his first Masters appearance since Fuzzy Zoeller in
1979, a bad omen for Masters' rookies like the defending British
Open champion, Paul Lawrie, and Mike Weir, who is ranked No. 40 in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Those with recent strong finishes at Augusta include Duval, who
tied for second in 1998; Jim Furyk, who finished fourth in 1998;
Davis Love III, who finished second last year; and Mickelson, who
finished second in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   But much of the attention will be directed toward Woods, who
enters the tournament with three victories this year, and 10 in his
last 17 starts on the PGA Tour. Jack Nicklaus, who has won the
Masters a record six times, said that Woods' recent streak ranks
among the most impressive he has ever seen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that during the last six or eight months, Tiger is
playing better than I ever played, but I don't think a career is
made over six months,'' said Nicklaus, who won 18 major
professional championships. ``If he keeps going the way he's been
going, he's going to break all my records. A lot will depend on his
health and his desire to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he has the ability to make himself do something when he
needs to. That's the mark of champion. You're not going to keep
Tiger from playing well. He's too good a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Since Woods' record-setting 12-stroke victory in 1997 at the
Masters, however, he tied for eighth place in 1998 and tied for
18th last year. There are no guarantees at Augusta, and there have
been many unexpected winners. So while Woods enters as the
favorite, many players liked their chances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all want it badly,'' Norman said. ``It doesn't matter how
you're playing when you come here. When you get here, you want
it.''

MASTERS MIGHT WITNESS PASSING OF TORCH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUGUSTA, Ga. _ Fittingly, Jack Nicklaus, Arnold Palmer and Gary
Player are paired together today in the first round of the Masters
tournament that they lifted like a priceless antique and carried
lovingly into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
   Nicklaus, Palmer and Player won eight of the nine Masters
contested between 1958-1966. Among them, they have 13 green jackets
and 34 Grand Slam titles. They ushered in golf's Golden Age.
</P>
<P>
   And now, this first year of a new decade affords the threesome
the perfect opportunity to step aside and let the next terrific
triad play through.
</P>
<P>
   If CBS were on top of its game, it would orchestrate the passing
of the torch from Nicklaus, Palmer and Player to Tiger Woods,
Sergio Garcia and Aaron Baddeley. For the opening montage of its
telecast it would gather them all on Augusta National Golf Course's
putting green, soften the camera's focus, start the film rolling
and cue the violins.
</P>
<P>
   The era drawing to a close in golf and the one alighting are as
different as TV and DVD, Levittown and Islesworth, private lives
and private jets.
</P>
<P>
   As tough as it was for Palmer to make his first million and for
Nicklaus to win a following and for Player to stave off jet lag,
the stresses and strains facing Woods, Garcia and Baddeley will be
in many ways worse. The next set of torchbearers will carry the
burden of success but also of savage scrutiny. Since Nicklaus won
his last major here in 1986, the world has shrunk and the celebrity
culture has swelled so much it can swallow its young.
</P>
<P>
   The clamoring for information on today's public figures in this
24/7 news age knows no bounds. Goodness knows, a 20-year-old Palmer
never had to sit in front of a hundred reporters from all over the
world as Sergio Garcia did here Wednesday and answer the question,
``Is that a long-term relationship?''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that to the average 20-year-old, anything with a
shelf life longer than potato salad qualifies as enduring. Forget
that the question was about the working arrangement between Garcia
and his caddie, for crying out loud.
</P>
<P>
   Augusta National's slick, sloping greens must look tame to
Generation Next compared to the challenge of navigating adolescence
knowing perfect strangers are watching, pens poised to record every
step and stumble.
</P>
<P>
   It's an awkward time in a boy's life no matter how purely he can
strike a golf ball. Garcia might have come within two strokes of
beating Woods at the PGA Championship last August, but two months
earlier he had to withdraw from a tournament in Memphis after
suffering a severe acne attack.
</P>
<P>
   The number of pimples on his face was infinitesimal next to the
number of people who knew they were there. Talk about adding insult
to indignity.
</P>
<P>
   At the tender age of 24, Woods already is a seared veteran of
mass scrutiny. He has taken heat for telling a tasteless joke or
two, for being moody, for being self-involved. For, in short,
acting his age.
</P>
<P>
   During the PGA Championship last year, Woods was criticized for
looking too grim on the course by the same people who pop antacid
pills as their story deadlines draw near. After five years on the
PGA Tour, Woods is hip to the hypocrisy. He moves within a circle
of close friends who are less an entourage than a cocoon. They
protect him from all the rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a lot easier (being in the spotlight) now because I have
a better understanding of myself and what goes on around me,''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just grown up a little bit through trial and error and
experiences, just like everybody else my age.''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody wants to work as hard on his public persona as he
does his golf game. Fred Couples shirks the spotlight and Davis
Love III and David Duval circle it warily. Sometimes it's hard to
blame them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen players who don't want it,'' golfing great Greg
Norman said of the responsibilities that go hand-in-hand with
superstardom. ``They don't want those extra outside pressures. You
don't know what they are until you get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley, a 19-year-old amateur, officially arrived last
November when he beat Norman and Colin Montgomerie to win the
Australian Open. Woods, who has entertained Baddeley at his home in
the gated Orlando community of Isleworth, says the Australian has
more game than he did at the same age.
</P>
<P>
   Baddeley's parents have reservations about their son turning
professional. They don't want his career to go the way of Justin
Rose's, the English teen who tied for fourth at the 1998 British
Open, turned pro and hasn't been seen on the leaderboard since.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, their son doesn't share their concern. In fact, being
around other pros this week has made the prospect of joining them
``in a way nearly irresistible,'' Baddeley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have so much fun out here,'' Baddeley said. ``The pros
get treated so well. I'm definitely looking forward to being out
here.''
</P>
<P>
   The easy-going Baddeley sees only the free food spreads and the
courtesy cars and the manicured grounds now. All the rest, he'll
have to deal with later.
</P>
<P>
   Or not. The choice, really, will be his.

GORE ABRUPTLY CANCELS A NORTH CAROLINA TRIP 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Vice President Al Gore Wednesday abruptly canceled
a campaign trip to North Carolina on Thursday, citing the illness
of a friend. But aides would not disclose the friend's identity and
provided no further details.
</P>
<P>
   Gore was to spend the day at the Marie G. Davis middle school in
Charlotte, N.C., in what would have been the second in a series of
``school days'' the vice president plans to attend. The event was
rescheduled for April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's staff first said the event was canceled for ``personal
reasons.'' Questions about whether Gore or his wife was ill,
though, Gore's communications director, Laura Quinn, issued a
statement saying: ``This is not in any way related to any family
member, nor the health of the Vice President or Gore. It has to do
with the health of a friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Several top advisers to Gore said they had no more information.
</P>
<P>
   Gore did speak Wednesday morning to about 2,000 members of the
Construction and Building Trades Department of the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech, he vowed to keep Social Security intact and
suggested that Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, his Republican rival,
wanted to privatize the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants to pursue a privatization formula that would take a
good bit of the money that is now put into the fund and divert it
toward a private personal savings account,'' Gore said of Bush's
plan. ``He's talking about privatizing it? No way!''
</P>
<P>
   Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said that Gore was
distorting Bush's plan to allow payees invest part of their payroll
taxes in personal savings accounts. ``That's not really privatizing
it,'' Fleischer said. ``He likes to use attack words.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore also referred to his support for ``free and fair trade.''
But he did not mention the coming legislative battle over permanent
normal trade relations for China, which he supports. The AFL-CIO,
which endorsed Gore for president, opposes the pact and plans a
major demonstration against it here next week. (af)

GARY STEVENS FINDING SUCCESS AS TRAINER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARCADIA, Calif. _ This week more than most, with a Santa Anita
Derby to be run, it's hard for Gary Stevens to believe he'll never
ride a Stevens won seven of the past 12 Santa Anita Derbies as a
jockey before abruptly retiring in December because of chronic pain
in his arthritic right knee.
</P>
<P>
   If he wins the $1 million race on Saturday, he'll do it in the
normally anonymous role of an assistant trainer, helping to prepare
2-year-old champion Anees for California's premier Kentucky Derby
springboard.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm still having a hard time dealing with it,'' Stevens said
of the end of his Hall of Fame riding career. ``The hard part is
accepting that it's over. I'm 37 years old and what the hell am I
going to do with myself?''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is great,'' he said, walking through the Santa Anita barn
where he assists Alex Hassinger, trainer of horses owned by Saudi
Prince Ahmed Salman's Thoroughbred Corp. ``But it's not like
riding.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, Stevens said, the knee feels so good he envisions a
comeback. But then he'll exercise horses for a couple of days and
need a week of rest for the swelling to go down. Or the weather
will change and a stabbing pain will appear from out of the clouds.
Or a doctor will deliver a second, third or fourth opinion as
gloomy as the rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw an orthopedic specialist in New York,'' Stevens said.
``He basically counseled me for 45 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   So, at least until a medical miracle occurs, Stevens leaves
behind a 20-year career in which he rode three Kentucky Derby
winners and seven Breeders' Cup winners.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 5 o'clock each morning, the son of Pacific Northwest
trainer Ron Stevens devotes himself to learning new aspects of the
craft of horsemanship. From the ground up. His future could hold a
career as a trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he wanted to, he'd be a great trainer,'' Hassinger said.
``He has a keen perception of the personalities of these horses . .
. . Everybody thinks of Gary as a Hall of Fame rider, but he's an
extremely experienced horseman. He goes over Anees every day and
probably knows as much as anybody about this horse.''
</P>
<P>
   Stevens' Thoroughbred Corp. riding contract has been reworked.
He's an assistant trainer ``and consultant'' now. For Hassinger,
there must be some advantage in getting advice from the man who
rode Anees to his Breeders' Cup Juvenile victory at Gulfstream Park
last November and has dominated the Santa Anita Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have certain ideas about what it takes for a horse to get to
the grand finale, which is the Kentucky Derby (May 6),'' Stevens
said. ``Fortunately for us, we were set back (by Anees' foot
bruise) at the first of the year, but we were about to get the work
in that we needed and get in the race we needed.''
</P>
<P>
   Anees, third behind Fusaichi Pegasus and The Deputy in the March
19 San Felipe Stakes, his only start since the Breeders' Cup,
reminds Stevens most of Thunder Gulch, the colt he rode to victory
in the 1995 Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was an improving colt who never came into his own until the
Kentucky Derby,'' Stevens said. ``This colt . . . . he's improving
with every single race. You see steps forward every day he
trains.''
</P>
<P>
   Corey Nakatani is scheduled to ride Anees in the Santa Anita
Derby. Also expected to be entered this morning for the 1-mile race
for 3-year-olds unbeaten San Rafael Stakes winner are War Chant
(Jerry Bailey), San Felipe runnerup The Deputy (Chris McCarron),
leading filly Surfside (Pat Day), Captain Steve (Robby Albarado)
and Cocky (Alex Solis).
</P>
<P>
   Stevens, who won the race the past two years with Indian Charlie
and General Challenge, will watch from somewhere other than
horseback for the first time since 1984. Being a trainer in
training doesn't sound like his dream job, but it has one benefit.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only thing that's keeping my mind off not riding,''
he said.

FIRMS PITCH WARES AT INTERNET EXPO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JASON Z. COHEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They came in search of customers, strategic
partners, even employees.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies schlepped their computers, Web cams and
plenty of promotional goodies Wednesday to Spring Internet World
2000, an event organizers say is the largest gathering of Internet
professionals to date.
</P>
<P>
   About 50,000 people registered to attend the show, which will
run through Friday at the Los Angeles Convention Center.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the wandering masses of Internet professionals and
elaborate booths featuring rock-climbing walls, celebrity
spokespeople and talking robots, Greater San Fernando Valley area
companies ranging from Westlake Village-based Internet service
provider NetZero Inc. to start-ups such as Woodland Hills-based
FocusFocusInc. pitched their products.
</P>
<P>
   For FocusFocus Inc., the trade show represents a chance to
introduce its product, free Web teleconferencing software.
</P>
<P>
   The product is designed to allow smooth operation with a 56K
modem, and it installs quickly on a user's Web site. The product
will allow users to talk to and see each other over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The company had its booth inside the Microsoft Partners
Pavilion, a cluster of companies that have partnerships with
Microsoft Corp. Although FocusFocus could have set up its own
booth, the company partnered with Microsoft to take advantage of a
shared high-speed Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Jillian Pinsker, co-chief executive officer of FocusFocus, said
the Microsoft booth increased her company's visibility by placing
it at the front of a large exhibit hall rather than in the middle
of a smaller one.
</P>
<P>
   ``This way, we know we're going to get a lot of people,''
Pinsker said.
</P>
<P>
   FocusFocus' goal at the show is attracting investors. The
private company is funded by its parent company, Skyline Tools, but
is entering a second round of financing, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mainly, we're looking for venture partners and strategic
partners,'' Pinsker said.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Woolery, senior director of strategic business for
Chatsworth-based DataDirect Networks, used the show to introduce a
new product, SAN DataDirector.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the network of equipment that manages the flow of
data on the Internet. The SAN DataDirector processes requests and
distributes information more quickly than the current technology,
Woolery said.
</P>
<P>
   The product is designed for companies that access software from
remote locations, called application service providers; Internet
service providers and others who must manage vast stores of data
and distribute them over networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're interested in reaching the folks who build the Internet.
We also want to reach out to a new pool of employees,'' Woolery
said. ``You have the whole gamut here, and we're trying to reach
all of them.''
</P>
<P>
   Woolery said DataDirect hopes to begin shipping the SAN Data
Director in late May or early June. The company, formed in 1998
with the merger of two private companies, plans an initial public
offering early next year.
</P>
<P>
   DataDirect Networks has 140 employees, and hopes to bring that
number to 250 in the next six to nine months.
</P>
<P>
   Van Nuys-based Centerlinq's booth attracted a steady stream of
visitors Wednesday. The company, a division of
GenesisIntermedia.com, places kiosks in malls across the country
offering special deals, coupons and Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   Account executive Russell Mayes and his partner, Mark Howard,
came to the show in search of advertising customers and companies
interested in partnering with Centerlinq.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to reach the dot-com people,'' Mayes said. ``We come
in with a new way to advertise dot-com companies.''

NORTH CAROLINA ACTS TO PROTECT TOBACCO COMPANIES
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   The North Carolina Legislature took just four hours at a special
session Wednesday to pass a law to protect the state's tobacco
companies from potentially industry-crippling penalties in a
class-action smoking lawsuit in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   The law, signed by Gov. Jim Hunt, places a $25 million cap on
the amount North Carolina-based companies must post as bond in any
state in appealing a punitive damage verdict.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina is home to three defendants in the lawsuit, the
R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., the Liggett Group and the Lorillard
Tobacco Co. Brown &AMP; Williamson and Philip Morris U.S.A. are also
defendants.
</P>
<P>
   A Miami jury is deciding whether to award compensatory damages
of $13.2 million to three plaintiffs in the class-action suit
involving 500,000 Florida smokers who are ill. Punitive damages in
the case, if awarded, are expected to reach tens of billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   According to Florida law, a defendant who appeals must post a
bond equal to 115 percent of an award once a judge enters that
verdict. Such a bond could financially ruin tobacco companies.
</P>
<P>
   The North Carolina law is similar to laws passed recently in
Virginia, Kentucky and Georgia. A federal judge Wednesday struck
down an order barring parties in the Florida suit from talking to
the news media. Judge Adalberto Jordan of U.S. District Court
called the order unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The order, which was imposed in 1998 by Judge Robert Kaye of
Florida Circuit Court, had been challenged by The Wall Street
Journal, The New York Times, USA Today, The Miami Herald, The Tampa
Tribune and the Richmond, Va., Times-Dispatch.

EARLY ARRIVAL PAYING OFF FOR ROGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ If USC's football season started today, the
starting right tackle would be . . . . Jacob Rogers?
</P>
<P>
   In the most surprising development in the opening half of spring
practice, Rogers, a redshirt freshman from Oxnard High who arrived
as a tight end, has moved atop the depth chart _ for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guy who has moved above all the others is Jacob Rogers,''
USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He has a nose up on everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   The 6-foot-6 Rogers has gained 50 pounds since arriving at USC
and now weighs 285.
</P>
<P>
   There was a possibility that starting guard Zach Wilson would be
moved to tackle, but Hackett said Wilson will continue to play
right guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best thing for us is to start Trevor Roberts at left guard
and Zach at right guard,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that helped Rogers, according to Hackett, is that he
graduated early from Oxnard and enrolled at USC in January, 1999,
which allowed him to attend last year's spring drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a heck of a way to do it,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   One side effect of Rogers being the top right tackle is that it
provides a huge opportunity for freshman Joe McGuire to try and win
the spot when he arrives in August.
</P>
<P>
   ``Joe is in the catbird seat in terms of having an
opportunity,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   __ McCaffrey out: Senior offensive tackle Brent McCaffrey
suffered a high ankle sprain in Friday's scrimmage and will miss
the rest of the spring. It's also doubtful that freshman tight end
Chad Cook will return after twisting his knee.
</P>
<P>
   Defensive tackle Shamsud-Din Abdul-Shaheed underwent shoulder
surgery Tuesday and will be out the rest of the spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole complexion has changed,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   With McCaffrey out, junior Faasea Mailo will be the left tackle.
Redshirt freshman lineman Norm Katnik has moved to tight end on a
temporary basis to replace Cook.
</P>
<P>
   __ Academic problems: Linebacker John Cousins, tight end Antoine
Harris, wide receiver Kareem Kelly and defensive end Omar Nazel are
all sitting out practices this week to concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll probably have more exact things to say in a couple
days,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   There's a possibility some of the players will not return for
any more spring practices, and might have to attend summer classes
to retain their eligibility. Hackett has kept players out of spring
practices the previous two years to concentrate on academics.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly also might be out of track; he is one of the Trojans' top
sprinters.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scholarship for Nickels? Hackett never has awarded a
scholarship to a walk-on in the spring, but wide receiver Matt
Nickels is close to earning one based on his performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Matt Nickels is making a move,'' Hackett said. ``He's right on
line (for a scholarship).''
</P>
<P>
   Nickels was a high school teammate of Palmer at Santa Margarita
and should be USC's fifth wide receiver behind Kelly, Marcell
Allmond, Steve Stevenson and Keary Colbert.
</P>
<P>
   __ Tight battle: The position that is the intensely contested,
according to Hackett, is tailback, where sophomore Sultan
McCullough and junior Malaefou MacKenzie are vying for the No. 1
spot.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably the most heated competition on the entire
team,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   The situation could be even more muddled in the fall, when
Banning High tailback Chris Howard arrives.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, junior Kori Dickerson has taken a lead over freshman
Chris Prosser and Cousins at strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   __ Scrimmage Saturday: USC will hold a scrimmage Saturday at 1
p.m. at the Coliseum. Admission is $25 for adults and $20 for
children under 12. Included is a luncheon package. Children under 5
are free.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the midst of a wildly oscillating market,
Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., one of the oldest and best-known
insurers, issued nearly 500 million shares to more than 9 million
policyholders Wednesday, instantly making the company's shares by
far the most widely held in America.
</P>
<P>
   The company sold an additional 202 million shares to investors
at an initial price of $14.25. The shares finished the day up
nearly 8 percent, at $15.375.
</P>
<P>
   While a few policyholders _ the formal owners of MetLife, which
had been a mutual company that functioned much like a cooperative _
had earlier questioned whether the assets of the company would be
fairly distributed in the conversion to public ownership, many
seemed delighted Wednesday with the shares they received.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is like found money for me,'' said Paolo Capoferri, who
runs a small Italian food importing business in Bridgewater, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Like the other policyholders, Capoferri had originally gone to
MetLife strictly to buy insurance. Whatever the technicalities, he
never thought of himself as an owner. ``It never crossed my mind
that I might get some stock out of this,'' he said, after receiving
206 shares of MetLife on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As MetLife made the transformation to public ownership, it
soared ahead of Lucent Technologies as the company with the largest
number of stockholders, many of them concentrated in New York, New
Jersey and Connecticut. With 4.6 million shareholders, Lucent had
taken the lead from its former parent, AT&AMP;T, which now has 4.1
million shareholders and, until last August, had for decades been
the company with the most shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Even with all its shareholders though, MetLife came out far
behind Lucent in market value. With 695.9 million shares
outstanding, MetLife had a market value of about $11.7 billion,
about one-twentieth of Lucent's market value of $199 billion and
about one-fiftieth that of General Electric, Cisco Systems and
Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of insurance stocks have been depressed in general, as
have those of most banks and brokerage firms. MetLife cut back the
number of shares it sold to the general public to 202 million, down
from an original 255 million, because of market conditions. And
analysts said its opening price represented only about 75 percent
of its book value, less than other insurers received as they
recently went public.
</P>
<P>
   Yet there was no sign of concern among MetLife policyholders.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Capoferri planned to buy more Me Life shares. ``I
buy stocks and mutual funds with the long term in mind,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Gabriele, who runs the Gabriele Tire &AMP; Auto Centers in
Scotch Plains and South Amboy, N.J., received 405 shares of MetLife
stock. And he plans to hold on to them, too, along with the 400
shares of Merck that he has accumulated over the years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even think about my Merck shares,'' he said. ``My
buddies are always telling me to buy this stock and that crazy
stock. I dabbled in them and they were all losers. But something
like Met, I believe in the company. I'll probably hold onto them.''
</P>
<P>
   Under its conversion plan, MetLife could have postponed its
public offering for at least a year, hoping for better market
conditions. But soon after ringing the opening bell at the New York
Stock Exchange on Wednesday morning, as the chief executive of the
newest member, Robert H. Benmosche said in an interview that he
wanted to move now to make sure ``we have the maximum flexibility
when the opportunity presents itself'' to raise more capital and
make acquisitions.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Frinquelli, a partner at Renaissance Fund Advisers, an
investment company that specializes in insurance, bought more than
50,000 shares of MetLife, impressed during the MetLife road show
that it had a realistic plan for growth and that it planned to
remain focused on middle-class customers while many competitors
were shooting for wealthier people.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics of the MetLife conversion have complained about the
potential for executives to gain great wealth through stock
options. Not Gabriele. ``This is America,'' he said. ``I believe in
the free enterprise system. If the executives of MetLife turn this
stock from a $14 stock to a $50 stock, they deserve everything they
get. If the performance of the stock is motivation for them to
perform, what's wrong with that?''
</P>
<P>
   Some policyholders said they liked MetLife stock for the very
reason it was ignored by many investors who have been chasing
Internet issues: It is likely to be a steady, but not spectacular
grower. ``I like to sleep at night,'' said Capoferri, ``and MetLife
at $14 a share is going to let me get my sleep.''

<P>
   SURVEY OF WOMEN
</P>
<P>
   A survey for a Democratic women's group, Emily's List, shows
that Vice President Al Gore has made big gains among women in the
last three months and now leads Gov. George W. Bush among women by
46 percent to 40 percent. But the candidates are intensely
competitive among several subgroups of women, including white
suburbanites, married mothers and mainline Protestants. Education
is solidly at the top of women's agenda, according to the poll,
which was conducted March 21-24 and has a margin of error of plus
or minus 3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   GORE GETS BRADLEY AIDE
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of his continuing efforts to unite the Democratic
Party, Vice President Al Gore plans to announce on Monday the
endorsements of a group of Bill Bradley's Florida supporters. The
group will be lead by Stephen Pajcic, a Jacksonville lawyer who
raised money for Bradley. Pajcic said he also expects to help raise
money for Gore.
</P>
<P>
   VICTORY CLAIMED, NOT WON
</P>
<P>
   Although the competition has vanished, the Bush campaign
continues to trumpet its victories in Republican primaries. It went
a boast too far on Tuesday. ``Thank you Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and
Kansas,'' read a statement from Gov. George W. Bush that was
electronically mailed to reporters. The problem was that Kansas had
canceled its contest. The campaign seems to have an itchy e-mail
finger: other recent mailings teased Vice President Al Gore for a
mistake that was actually made by a news service that distributed
the information and misidentified Education Secretary Richard Riley
as Bill Riley.
</P>
<P>
   LOTT CHALLENGER SELECTED
</P>
<P>
   In a Mississippi Democratic runoff election Tuesday, Troy Brown
defeated Rickey Cole by a wide margin. Brown, 36, an
African-American who ran unsuccessfully for lieutenant governor
last fall, is now set to face the Senate majority leader, Trent
Lott, in November.
</P>
<P>
   GOVERNOR'S BROTHER IS MAYOR
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Ed Thompson, the brother of Gov. Tommy Thompson of
Wisconsin, was elected mayor of Tomah, a Wisconsin town of about
8,000. Thompson, a former poker player in Las Vegas, entered the
race after his supper club was suspected of illegal operation of
video poker games and raided. The case was settled out of court.

RUTAN UNVEILS NEW BREED OF AIRCRAFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM SKEEN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOJAVE _ A twin-engine aircraft described as giant leap in
general aviation design rolled out Wednesday at famed designer Burt
Rutan's Scaled Composites Co.
</P>
<P>
   Featuring twin tail booms and propellers at both the front and
back of the fuselage, Adam M-309 flew over about 100 invited guests
at the Mojave Airport, then landed so they could take a closer look
at the craft.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really taking a modern approach to aircraft,'' said
John Knudsen, president of Colorado-based Adam Aircraft Industries.
``Most airplanes that are out there are based on 40-year-old
designs.''
</P>
<P>
   The product of a collaboration between Rick Adam, founder of
Adam Aircraft, and Scaled Composites, the M-309 is expected to be
manufactured in Denver. First deliveries are expected in 2003.
</P>
<P>
   No price has been set for the airplane, but Adam Aircraft
officials said it will be competitive with other twin-engine
general aviation aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   Differing from most other general aviation aircraft, the
airplane is built out of carbon fiber composites and features a
glass cockpit in which traditional analog gauges are replaced with
digital, finger-touch displays.
</P>
<P>
   The six-seat aircraft is just under 32 feet long and has a wing
span of 42 feet. The aircraft is expected to have a top speed of
about 290 mph and a range of over 1,500 miles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has very, very long range - the range is about twice what
it is for airplanes in its class,'' Rutan said.
</P>
<P>
   While Wednesday's event was the aircraft's official rollout, the
aircraft actually made its first flight March 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not very often you fly a new airplane and the pilot comes
back and says, `There was no squawks, let's go again,''' Rutan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Adam M-309 is also expected to be a step up in terms of safety
compared to other twin-engine aircraft. The positioning of the
engines means that if a pilot were to lose one engine, the aircraft
would maintain its lateral stability.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft will have a low stall speed of about 84 mph,
allowing a pilot to regain control of the aircraft at low speeds.
</P>
<P>
   Adam M-309 is the latest project from Rutan, whose previous work
has ranged from a keel for an America's Cup yacht to fabricating an
experimental aircraft the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration is using to test the design of a space station
``lifeboat.''
</P>
<P>
   Rutan is perhaps best known as the designer of the Voyager
aircraft that his brother, Dick, and Jeana Yeager flown around the
world nonstop on one tank of gas in 1986.

 &HT;    ELIAN'S FATHER COMING TO U.S., SETS UP SHOWDOWN WITH MIAMI
FAMILY
 &HT;    Moving in both International and Washington categories.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ In a major development that sets the stage for a
dramatic showdown in Miami, the father of 6-year-old Cuban rafter
Elian Gonzalez is expected to fly to Washington, D.C. early
Thursday in a bid to regain custody of his son.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Miguel Gonzalez, his second wife and their infant son will
arrive at Washington Dulles International Airport outside the
nation's capitol around 7 a.m. EST, said Gregory Craig, an
influential Washington attorney representing Elian's father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's time for this reunion to go forward,'' Craig told
reporters shortly after he returned to Washington from Havana late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from Elian's Miami relatives,
who have cared for the boy since he was rescued at sea on
Thanksgiving Day. The family said months ago they would welcome
Elian's father should he come to the United States, but in the past
week they have thrown up numerous roadblocks to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials maintain that they have the
authority to remove the boy from the Miami family, and have said
they would put Elian in his father's custody should Gonzalez come
to this country.
</P>
<P>
   But the wild card remains Miami's volatile Cuban exile
community, which has turned Elian into a symbol of their struggle
against Cuban President Fidel Castro. A small, but determined group
of protestors has maintained a near-constant vigil outside the
Miami relatives' Little Havana home, vowing to form a human chain
to block any effort to send Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the pending arrival of Elian's father to the United
States was just spreading through Miami late Wednesday, but it
seemed certain the crowd of protestors would swell as the reunion
grew imminent.
</P>
<P>
   But details of the reunion remained unclear. U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service officials have been negotiating for the
past week with attorneys for the Miami relatives, but have been
unable to reach an agreement over the timing and location of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The family has been demanding that an independent team of
psychologists should first examine Elian and determine whether
turning him over to his father is best for the child. They also
want a promise that Elian will remain in the United States until a
federal court battle over the matter is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The family has also said that while they would welcome Elian's
father into their home, they would not assist in taking the boy
elsewhere to meet his father.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed sources, Miami television station WSVN-Channel 7
reported late Wednesday that it may be a week before the reunion
takes place. The family would be served notice and given time to
prepare the boy for the change of custody, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The station also reported that Elian was not at the home of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, Wednesday night, but was at an
undisclosed location with his cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, who has
been his primary care-giver the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez was released from a Coral Gables hospital
Wednesday after spending the night there following her collapse
from emotional exhaustion early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapidly-unfolding events seemed to point toward a climax
of the long-running saga which has placed the little boy with the
angelic face at the center of an international tug-of-war. Elian
was one of the few survivors of an ill-fated trip from Cuba that
left his mother and 10 other people dead after their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials immediately placed the boy with his Miami
relatives, but maintained custody over him.
</P>
<P>
   In January, they ruled he should be returned to his father. The
Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit to block the decision, but
in March a Miami federal judge ruled against them.
</P>
<P>
   The family appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, which is scheduled to hear the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Craig indicated that Elian's father would remain in the United
States until the court appeal is resolved. It is believed that he
will live in the home of a Cuban diplomat near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear late Wednesday whether an entourage of more than
20 other people would be allowed to join him. Castro wants a team
of psychologists, as well as some of Elian's schoolmates, to help
him begin readjusting to life with his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not yet finished processing travel visa
applications for the entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The key stumbling block still remained the actual transfer of
the boy to his father. Without the Miami family's cooperation,
federal officials are faced with going to the Little Havana home
and taking the boy, an event likely to touch off angry protests and
possibly violence in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who has ultimate authority in
the case, has insisted she would do everything possible to avoid
sparking any disturbances. But she has also said the boy will be
placed in the custody of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Attorney General has been clear that if we can't bring
about this reunion in a cooperative way, she will enforce the
law,'' Bo Cooper, general counsel of the INS, told reporters
Wednesday.

<P>
   ``It's time for this reunion to go forward,'' Craig told
reporters shortly after he returned to Washington from Havana late
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from Elian's Miami relatives,
who have cared for the boy since he was rescued at sea on
Thanksgiving Day. The family said months ago they would welcome
Elian's father should he come to the United States, but in the past
week they have thrown up numerous roadblocks to the reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials maintain that they have the
authority to remove the boy from the Miami family, and have said
they would put Elian in his father's custody should Gonzalez come
to this country.
</P>
<P>
   But the wild card remains Miami's volatile Cuban exile
community, which has turned Elian into a symbol of their struggle
against Cuban President Fidel Castro. A small, but determined group
of protestors has maintained a near-constant vigil outside the
Miami relatives' Little Havana home, vowing to form a human chain
to block any effort to send Elian back to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Word of the pending arrival of Elian's father to the United
States was just spreading through Miami late Wednesday, but it
seemed certain the crowd of protestors would swell as the reunion
grew imminent.
</P>
<P>
   But details of the reunion remained unclear. U.S. Immigration
and Naturalization Service officials have been negotiating for the
past week with attorneys for the Miami relatives, but have been
unable to reach an agreement over the timing and location of the
event.
</P>
<P>
   The family has been demanding that an independent team of
psychologists should first examine Elian and determine whether
turning him over to his father is best for the child. They also
want a promise that Elian will remain in the United States until a
federal court battle over the matter is resolved.
</P>
<P>
   The family has also said that while they would welcome Elian's
father into their home, they would not assist in taking the boy
elsewhere to meet his father.
</P>
<P>
   Citing unnamed sources, Miami television station WSVN-Channel 7
reported late Wednesday that it may be a week before the reunion
takes place. The family would be served notice and given time to
prepare the boy for the change of custody, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   The station also reported that Elian was not at the home of his
great-uncle, Lazaro Gonzales, Wednesday night, but was at an
undisclosed location with his cousin, Marisleysis Gonzalez, who has
been his primary care-giver the past four months.
</P>
<P>
   Marisleysis Gonzalez was released from a Coral Gables hospital
Wednesday after spending the night there following her collapse
from emotional exhaustion early Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the rapidly-unfolding events seemed to point toward a climax
of the long-running saga which has placed the little boy with the
angelic face at the center of an international tug-of-war. Elian
was one of the few survivors of an ill-fated trip from Cuba that
left his mother and 10 other people dead after their boat capsized.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials immediately placed the boy with his Miami
relatives, but maintained custody over him.
</P>
<P>
   In January, they ruled he should be returned to his father. The
Miami relatives filed a federal lawsuit to block the decision, but
in March a Miami federal judge ruled against them.
</P>
<P>
   The family appealed to the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals in
Atlanta, which is scheduled to hear the case May 11.
</P>
<P>
   Craig indicated that Elian's father would remain in the United
States until the court appeal is resolved. It is believed that he
will live in the home of a Cuban diplomat near Washington.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear late Wednesday whether an entourage of more than
20 other people would be allowed to join him. Castro wants a team
of psychologists, as well as some of Elian's schoolmates, to help
him begin readjusting to life with his Cuban family.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials have not yet finished processing travel visa
applications for the entourage.
</P>
<P>
   The key stumbling block still remained the actual transfer of
the boy to his father. Without the Miami family's cooperation,
federal officials are faced with going to the Little Havana home
and taking the boy, an event likely to touch off angry protests and
possibly violence in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno, who has ultimate authority in
the case, has insisted she would do everything possible to avoid
sparking any disturbances. But she has also said the boy will be
placed in the custody of his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Attorney General has been clear that if we can't bring
about this reunion in a cooperative way, she will enforce the
law,'' Bo Cooper, general counsel of the INS, told reporters
Wednesday.

WHO WANTS TO PARODY `MILLIONAIRE'? THERE IS NO FINAL ANSWER. 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALLISON FASS  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A contestant on the Comedy Central game show ``Win Ben Stein's
Money'' was recently asked this question: ``For $1, what is your
first name?''
</P>
<P>
   As Ben Stein, dressed as Regis Philbin, stood by, the
contestant, named Joe, was offered these choices: a) Santa b)
Moesha c) Jesus and d) Joe.
</P>
<P>
   That parody is just one example of how the media are
capitalizing on the popularity of ``Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire,'' the ABC game show that has been topping the Nielsen
ratings week after week with Philbin as the host.
</P>
<P>
   Though giveaway shows have always been around _ ``Win Ben
Stein's Money'' itself has run for three seasons _ the madness
surrounding ``Millionaire'' is inspiring an increasing number of
spoofs, knockoffs and ripoffs in advertising as well as
programming.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns for marketers as disparate as exercise clubs, discount
retailers and banks have played off the ``Millionaire'' theme,
complete with make-believe lifelines and variations on the Philbin
catch phrase, ``Is that your final answer?'' The series even
inspired a skit that was part of a presentation last week at the
annual Television Advertising Forum sponsored by the Association of
National Advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   Crunch Fitness, which operates gyms in Los Angeles, Miami, New
York and other cities, plans to start running a $15 million
campaign this week centered on ``Millionaire.'' The ads, created by
DiMassimo Brand Advertising in New York, suggest that being fit
enough to beat up a millionaire is better than being a millionaire,
or even marrying one.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign will offer a contest for consumers at least 18
years old: the chance to win six weeks of free kickboxing lessons
and then box with a millionaire.
   ``There's so much mania around money right now in this
country,'' said Mark DiMassimo, president and creative director at
DiMassimo, ``we want to make fun of that.''
</P>
<P>
   The hoopla surrounding ``Millionaire'' is not confined to the
United States. In Canada, where the CTV network carries the show in
a simulcast of ABC, Zellers, a discount retailer owned by the
Hudson's Bay Co., is running a television campaign to promote a
contest aimed at mothers. Its theme: ``Wouldn't a million dollars
make your life so much easier?'' Three commercials depict a mother
who uses the $1 million prize to hire an executive assistant, who
performs undesirable tasks like lecturing her children.
</P>
<P>
   Zellers had been considering a million-dollar promotion to start
in the fall, said Janet Kestin, creative director at the agency
that created the campaign, Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Toronto, part of the
Ogilvy &AMP; Mather Worldwide unit of the WPP Group. But everyone
involved agreed that, as she put it, ``millionaire fever is now.''
</P>
<P>
   WingspanBank.com in Wilmington, Del., an online bank owned by
First U.S.A. Bank N.A., recently completed a 28-market, two-month
radio campaign with a millionaire theme. The radio spots by eSource
Marketing in Westport, Conn. _ the interactive unit of the Source
Marketing division of Maxxcom _ were centered on a game asking
trivia questions about famous millionaires.
</P>
<P>
   Marketers are eager to tap into popular phenomena like
``Millionaire,'' said Howard Steinberg, president at Source
Marketing, because they ``are fighting for that little edge that
pulls a consumer's attention.''
</P>
<P>
   Money was no object _ and was not the object at all, in fact _
when David Marans, senior partner and director for media research
at J. Walter Thompson U.S.A., part of WPP, parodied ``Millionaire''
at the TV ad forum, which was held last Thursday at the Plaza Hotel
in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   As part of a presentation on problems with using ratings to
measure audiences, Marans mimicked Philbin's sartorial style by
wearing a dark blue tie on a dark blue shirt. As his contestant, he
``drafted'' a client, Kaki Hinton, senior director for advertising
services at the Warner-Lambert Co., to pretend to play the game.
</P>
<P>
   All the dollar amounts for correct answers referred to amounts
of money spent by advertisers to run commercials on network and
local television. The humorous format, Marans said, allowed him to
get his ideas on audience measurement across in a more ``palatable
form.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, one question he asked Hinton was to identify the
``21st-century, state of the art, reliable method'' by which
ratings in local markets were collected. Her choices were:
(a)infrared devices (b) solar powered sensors (c) unobtrusive
passive devices and (d) paper and pencil. The answer was ``d''; in
fact, all the answers were ``d,'' a clue that Marans shared with
Hinton and the audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're spoofing something so part of pop culture, so
overexposed,'' Marans said, ``you better make it good.'' (af)

RIVALS FOR SENATE EMPLOY OPPOSITE MEDIA STRATEGIES  
 BY ELISABETH BUMILLER  
</HEADLINE>
  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Since the beginning of the year, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has
given interviews, by his count, to at least eight national
television programs across the country, all part of a plan, his
advisers say, that has helped him get national attention and raise
millions of dollars for his Senate campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Giuliani has mostly avoided the headaches of
one-on-one interviews with local newspapers because, the mayor said
this week, they tend to write such nettlesome things as ```When he
said that, he twitched' or `When he did this, he was angry.'''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, by contrast, has turned down almost all
interview requests from national programs and instead focused on
television affiliates and large and medium newspapers across the
state, all part of a plan, her advisers say, to underscore that she
is a local political candidate and not just the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ``Local, local, local,'' emphasized Howard Wolfson, Clinton's
press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Like so much else about New York's most intense Senate
candidates, their media strategies are mirror opposites of each
other. Both also reveal some of the character of their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   For Clinton, strategy dictates that she never do anything, such
as give an interview to Barbara Walters, to remind voters that she
comes from anywhere but New York. For Giuliani, it is a chance to
raise his national profile and enjoy the attention of media
luminaries like Larry King, Cokie Roberts and Tim Russert, even if
Russert, as Giuliani's advisers admit, pinned him to the wall in a
recent interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mayor isn't afraid of tough questions, nor does he duck on
the issues,'' said Bruce Teitelbaum, Giuliani's campaign manager.
``But he prefers to answer those questions by speaking directly to
people.''
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, Giuliani has become something of a radio
talk-show host, and sometimes seems to be on the airwaves as often
as a local traffic report.
</P>
<P>
   He already has three regular radio programs, dating from before
the campaign: ``Live From City Hall With Rudy Giuliani,'' a
45-minute call-in show on Friday mornings on WABC; ``Ask the
Mayor,'' another call-in show on the first Thursday of every month
on WCBS; and a weekly Sunday morning address to New Yorkers on
``current topics of interest'' on WINS.
</P>
<P>
   But lately, the mayor has stepped up his interviews with radio
stations across the state. By his count, he has been interviewed by
no less than 23 radio stations since the year began.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always liked the idea of direct communication with the
people who are going to get to decide whether to vote for me,'' he
said on Tuesday on a bus trip to Long Island with Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz. ``That's why I do so many radio shows.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Giuliani has done far fewer interviews with local
television stations and no long interviews about his Senate
campaign with New York City television reporters, with whom he
often spars at his daily press briefings at City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The mayor added that he likes it when newspapers and magazines
print only questions and answers from an interview.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great, when they print the entire Q-and-A,'' Giuliani
said. ``Then somebody can say, `Oh, yeah, he's a jerk,' or `He's
very smart,' as opposed to somebody else interpreting it.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But Giuliani's advisers also say that his approach, particularly
with national television, has helped him raise $19 million for his
race _ $7 million more than Clinton _ and has bolstered the
response from his national direct mail campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Say you're a $25 donor and you live in Kansas,'' said Roger
Stone, a Republican political consultant. ``You see Rudy on TV, you
get a solicitation in the mail and you send in your check.''
</P>
<P>
   Stone added that he thought the mayor's strategy of avoiding
long local interviews about his Senate ambitions was wise, for now.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a school of thought that you limit media access to
your candidate and you control the flow of news,'' Stone said.
``That's exactly what he's doing. It's a viable strategy, and it's
certainly working for the time being.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, on the other hand, has talked to nearly every
large and medium newspaper and television affiliate in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the first lady, and she needed to establish
relationships for the first time with local media people throughout
the state,'' said Ken Sunshine, a public relations consultant who
is informally advising her campaign and who was chief of staff to
Mayor David Dinkins. ``There's no history positively or negatively
between her and the local media here.''

GROUPS QUESTION $1.6 MILLION GRANT TO COMPANY TIED TO WHITMAN'S
HUSBAND
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ Gov. Christie Whitman's husband, John Whitman,
was a major shareholder and director of an Internet company that
was approved for a $1.6 million grant from the state last November,
according to records from the New Jersey Department of Commerce and
Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitman, a venture capitalist, was a director of the e-mail
company Mail.com last fall when the company applied for and won a
state tax incentive grant to move its offices from Manhattan to
Jersey City, N.J., creating at least 175 jobs in New Jersey,
according to the company. Through Whitman's family investments and
those of his venture capital firms , he owned about 10 percent of
the company at the time of the grant application, state officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although state officials said neither Whitman nor her husband
were involved in the application or approval of the grant,
government watchdog groups said John Whitman's role in a company
that received state money raised questions of a conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``While there's no evidence of any legal wrongdoing, this
certainly gives the impression of a possible impropriety to members
of the public,'' said Pamela Garfield of Common Cause. ``We need to
be looking at ways to strengthen the laws governing spousal
business interests so that members of the public don't have to
worry about whether people are given special treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman's spokesman, Pete McDonough, insisted that Mail.com
received no preferential treatment and that John Whitman had not
been aware that the company was seeking a state grant until after
the application had been submitted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would applaud John Whitman for bringing 500 high-paying,
high-tech jobs to New Jersey,'' McDonough said, giving an upper
estimate of jobs added. ``The company took advantage of the
benefits New Jersey has to offer any high-tech company and it would
be to our detriment if they didn't, because those jobs would still
be in New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman joined the board of Mail.com in July 1998 and left
shortly after the company was approved for the grant. By partaking
in a series of stock issues and IPOs, Whitman, his investment firm
and the charitable trusts he controls have bought more than two
million shares in the company. Its stock closed at 12.93 Wednesday,
making Whitman's shares worth at least $26 million.
</P>
<P>
   Mail.com officials said their decision to seek a grant from New
Jersey's Business Employment Incentive Program was made without the
board's knowledge and was suggested by an outside consulting firm
that was hired to compare tax incentive packages of various
communities.
</P>
<P>
   Holly Lehr, a company spokeswoman, said Whitman was not involved
in preparing the application. Whitman was not listed on the
application because only those who own at least 15 percent of the
company are required to be listed.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as we know, he wasn't even aware of it,'' Lehr said.
</P>
<P>
   John Whitman did not return calls seeking comment. But McDonough
said that once Whitman learned that the company had applied for the
tax incentive, he called Gualberto Medina, the State Commissioner
of Commerce and Economic Development, to ask whether he should
disclose his involvement with the company.
</P>
<P>
   Medina's spokeswoman, Lisa Kruse, said that he told Whitman
there was no need to disclose his role in the company because he
owned less than 15 percent.

 By EDDIE SEFKO  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
AUGUSTA, Ga. _ If it was a sure thing that Tiger Woods was going to
slip on his second green jacket Sunday evening, the other 94
participants in the 2000 Masters would be shaking with fear instead
of excitement when they step up to the first tee today.
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the man for whom a TigerWoodsisGod.com Web site is
circulating through cyberspace was a dead-solid lock to conquer
Augusta National Golf Club, the next 55 players behind him in the
world golf rankings wouldn't bother spending the next few days
strolling around the prettiest acreage in golf.
</P>
<P>
   There are no gimmies in sports. Bookmakers in England have
installed Woods as the 9-4 favorite, meaning it's still more likely
somebody else will win. So, operating under the assumption that
Woods can be beaten, the next question becomes who has the best
chance of pulling off the upset.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who insist they won't bow down to Woods, even if
he's playing a course that seems handmade for him. Some people
don't believe this is his tournament to lose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, people think any event he plays in is Tiger's event
to win,'' said David Duval. ``I personally think this is my event
to win or lose this week. I've been working hard trying to make
sure everything falls into place this week. And I believe I will be
successful in that.''
</P>
<P>
   With Duval, and a few select others, you tend to believe them
when they say that.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is that this Masters is as wide-open as ever. If it's
not Mark O'Meara or Jose Maria Olazabal surprising the field, it
could be Bernhard Langer or Craig Parry. If not Duval, then Colin
Montgomerie.
</P>
<P>
   Or it could be Woods. But the point is that 72 holes at Augusta
National make it as much a crapshoot as any tournament.
</P>
<P>
   And while Woods has finished first or second in 10 of his last
11 starts, it also should be noted that he has lost four of his
last five tournaments.
</P>
<P>
   In that span, he has three seconds and a tie for 18th.
</P>
<P>
   The many splendid chasers have had their moments more often than
Woods of late.
</P>
<P>
   ``When players say Tiger is playing at 80 percent and we've got
to be playing at 110 percent to beat him, man, I'd love people to
say that about me,'' said Greg Norman. ``Davis Love made the
comment that he gets intimidated by Tiger Woods. Think about that.
I like Davis, and he's a good friend of mine. But when you read an
article like that, you go, `Whoa, they're already beaten.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If you don't think you're good enough to beat Tiger Woods,
don't even play out here.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, there are certain players who have the style of play
that fits at Augusta National.
</P>
<P>
   ``This course favors the long, high-ball hitter _ Tiger Woods,
Jack Nicklaus and Arnold Palmer in his day,'' Norman said.
</P>
<P>
   Woods couldn't agree more, saying that recent changes in the
course over the past two years play right into his hands rather
than having the intended effect of Tiger-proofing the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's helping anybody who can hit the ball long and high,''
Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   And doesn't that include himself? ``Last time I checked,'' he
added.
</P>
<P>
   Before the tournament even starts, there are some marquee
players you probably can mark off the list of contenders.
</P>
<P>
   Hal Sutton? Hasn't survived a Masters cut since 1985.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik? Has broken par only once in 10 Masters rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Vijay Singh? Six appearances, never better than 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Maggert? Only one top-20 in seven appearances at Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Janzen? Has never missed a cut here but hasn't finished
higher than 12th, either.
</P>
<P>
   And then there are those who seem a logical fit for a green
jacket.
</P>
<P>
   Duval? Top six in each of the past two years. Could be ready for
a breakthrough.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Els? Always hovering, never winning in the Masters. He's
due, considering he hasn't had a top-10 in a major since '97.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Furyk? Four of his last seven rounds at Augusta are 70 or
lower.
</P>
<P>
   Langer? Has made 16 consecutive cuts here, won twice and tied
for 11th in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Love? Top seven in four of the past five Masters. Par or better
each round in '99.
</P>
<P>
   Phil Mickelson? Came back from missing the cut at The Players to
win in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Colin Montgomerie? Eighth and 10th in the past two years but
never a serious threat.
</P>
<P>
   You can go on and on, including the past two winners (O'Meara
and Olazabal) among the possibilities. But the bottom line remains
that Woods is the only name that crops up when talk turns to the
Grand Slam, which remains a mythical feat until somebody does it.
</P>
<P>
   The likelihood of Woods winning the Masters, the U.S. Open, the
British Open and the PGA Championship remains remote, to say the
least, although he likes to think it can be done.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you win the right tournaments, you'll do all right,'' he
said. ``I won eight times last year on tour. You just have to win
the right ones.''
</P>
<P>
   Nick Price, another player who has had lukewarm results in his
Masters career, is among those who believe the Grand Slam is not
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a tall order, even for Tiger,'' Price said. ``But if
anyone could do it, certainly he could.''
</P>
<P>
   But the first step often is the hardest. You can't win all four
unless you win the first one.

YAHOO'S EARNING EXCEED PREDICTIONS

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Buoyed by accelerating growth overseas, Yahoo posted
stronger-than-expected profit and revenue for the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo, the No. 2 Internet service, said that it earned $78
million in the first quarter, up from $1.8 million a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo said it preferred that investors look at its own
calculation of ``pro-forma'' profit, which excludes a $41 million
investment gain as well as acquisition-related charges and payroll
taxes that it paid when employees exercised certain stock options.
By that measure, the company earned $63 million, or 10 cents a
share, compared with $18 million, or 3 cents a share a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts, who prefer to accept a company's definition of how to
measure income, had estimated a profit of 9 cents.
</P>
<P>
   The company's sales rose to $228 million from $103 million and
its audience grew briskly. Yahoo said it had more than 145 million
unique visitors in March, up from 60 million a year earlier. And
those users looked at an average of 625 million pages a day, up
from 275 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are beating my model on all key metrics,'' said Jamie
Kiggen, an analyst with Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. ``Notably
their revenue growth this quarter was as big as it was a year ago.
And they have a much bigger base.''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo also told investors that it had increased its target for
operating profits to a range of 32 to 38 percent of revenue, from
30 to 36 percent. The company said it believes its revenue will
increase faster than costs as its audience grows.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the many unprofitable companies in electronic commerce,
Yahoo is increasing its cash reserve and has $1.2 billion on hand,
up from $961 million at the end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 22 services based outside of the United States,
including its Japanese operation, accounted for 25 percent of the
services use, but only 14 percent of its revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yahoo has really become the global internet play,'' said Paul
W. Noglows, an analyst with Chase H &AMP; Q. Still, Noglows said it
remains unclear if Yahoo can sell enough advertising and other
services to take advantage of that audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question going forward is how do they leverage and
monetize their 145 million users,'' Noglows said. ``I don't think
we have seen the proof yet they can do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Separately, the company said it has hired Susan Decker, global
head of research at Donaldson Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette, to be its chief
financial officer. She will replace Gary Valenzuela, who will
retire in July.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo's stock closed at $165.56, down $1.81 for the day. The
company did not release its financial results until after the
regular trading session had closed. In after-hours trading the
stock fell by $5.81, to $159.75.

IMMIGRATION, NAFTA TOPICS IN MEXICO RACE
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The North American Free Trade Agreement should be
revised to ease immigration laws and protect Mexican workers
crossing the border into the United States, foreign policy advisers
for the top three Mexican presidential candidates said Wednesday in
a Los Angeles debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thousands of Mexican laborers are going to come north every
year seeking jobs, and we're not going to change that overnight, so
we should be realistic and not address the issue by building bigger
walls,'' said Carlos Salazar, a top aide to Vicente Fox of the
National Action Party (PAN).
</P>
<P>
   The topic has become a hot-button issue between Fox and his two
opponents, front-runner Francisco Labastida of the ruling
Institutional Revolution Party (PRI), and far-left candidate
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas of the Democratic Revolution Party (PRD), who
will face off in the July 2 Mexican elections.
</P>
<P>
   It could also become a hot topic in the U.S. presidential
elections in November because organized labor supports granting
amnesty to the 6 million illegal Latino immigrants the U.S.
Immigration and Naturalization Services estimates work in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Workers and small businesses are losing under the current
NAFTA rules,'' Salazar said at the debate organized by the
U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce and Town Hall Los Angeles, a
private speakers forum.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican Congressman Carlos Heredia, representing Cardenas in the
debate, suggested forming a commission with representatives from
Canada, the United States and Mexico to review the 1994 NAFTA deal
and add concessions on immigration and environmental protections.
</P>
<P>
   ``A tri-national forum looking at long-term immigration
solutions is the only realistic way to deal with this problem,
which has truly become a crisis for all sides,'' Heredia said.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Trevino, a Labastida adviser, also suggested creating an
ombudsman position in Mexico to act as an intermediary between the
U.S. and Mexican presidents strictly on the issue of immigration, a
plan all three parties have agreed on.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in a situation where two-thirds of the Mexican
population is living in poverty,'' Trevino said. ``We all know this
means that immigration into the United States is not going to be
solved overnight.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates also discussed setting up a system for
Mexican-Americans to send money to relatives in Mexico without
paying stiff bank or agency fees, and boosting California-Mexico
trade.
</P>
<P>
   James Clark, director of the U.S.-Mexico Chamber of Commerce,
said Mexico is the No. 1 importer in the world of goods produced in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still see room for improvement in trade to Mexico,'' Clark
said. ``The next Mexican president is going to have to have a
viable plan for creating more jobs in Mexico and boosting trade
from California, including agriculture and technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox, a Harvard graduate and former governor of Mexico's
Guanajuato state, poses the most serious threat to Labastida and
the PRI, which has controlled the presidency since the 1929 Mexican
revolution.

DENTIST ACCUSED OF USING FORCE ON CHILDREN 
 
</HEADLINE>
  By MARIA NEWMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New Jersey Board of Dentistry has temporarily suspended the
license of a pediatric dentist accused of using so much force to
restrain his young patients that he broke their bones or otherwise
bruised their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The dentist, Kevin Ward, who practiced in Union City, Vernon and
Maywood, will not be allowed to practice on any child or adult
until a hearing on Monday, said Mark S. Herr, the director of the
Division of Consumer Affairs, which oversees the board.
</P>
<P>
   The suspension came after the state's attorney general, John J.
Farmer, filed a complaint with the Division of Consumer Affairs,
charging that Ward's conduct was ``grossly and repeatedly
negligent'' and ``poses a clear and imminent danger to his
patients.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last seven years, according to the complaint, Ward used
so much force to restrain five children that he broke the leg of a
5-year-old boy, the wrist of a 4-year-old and the thumb of a
10-year-old girl. The complaint said Ward also frequently pulled
the arms of infant patients behind the dental chair and held them
there with his legs, covered their mouths and noses, pushed down
with his fist on patients' chests to restrain them and began dental
treatment without letting anesthesia take full effect.
</P>
<P>
   The board notified Ward of the complaint on Wednesday morning,
and called him to a hearing in the afternoon, Herr said. After
hearing from Ward and his lawyer, Vincent Loughlin, the board moved
to bar him from practicing until Monday's hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Ward nor his lawyer responded to requests for comment.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general made his complaints after the police and
county prosecutors refused to file criminal charges against Ward,
concluding each time that there was not enough evidence to prove
wrongful intent.
</P>
<P>
   Herr said although there was no criminal prosecution, the
attorney general, who oversees the licensing board, could seek
other action.
</P>
<P>
   ``While something may not violate a criminal statute, it may
violate a civil statute,'' Herr said. What is alleged in the
attorney general's complaint, he said, ``violates state civil
statutes governing dentists' conduct, more particularly the
statutes that regulate the performance of dentists.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be safe to say it's not the generally
accepted practice to break the limbs of your patients,'' Herr said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the board suspended Ward's license for a year in the
case of a 4-year-old boy who had been given an overdose of
anesthesia in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly this prior disciplinary matter failed to deter Dr.
Ward's continued misconduct,'' the attorney general's complaint
said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward works at the Children's Dental Center in Union City. He
recently lost two part-time jobs in Vernon and Maywood when reports
of the injuries to other young patients surfaced.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest case, he is said to have broken the leg of Mario
Rivero, 5, of North Bergen, N.J., whose mother said she had been
prevented from accompanying her son into the treatment room. Other
parents who filed complaints said they also had been kept from
being with their children.
</P>
<P>
   In all of the cases, according to the complaint, ``Dr. Ward
failed to obtain informed consent from the parents to use physical
restraint prior to commencing dental treatment and failed to obtain
the parents' assistance and/or consent when a problem arose.'' (mg)

SAMPRAS WAS CAREFREE `SMILEY' AS A KID
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; LOS ANGELES _ High on a hill overlooking the Pacific Ocean, the
Greek god of tennis appeared as if dropped from the heavens. He
scudded across the court like a cloud, carrying in his hands a
thunderbolt disguised as a tennis racket.
</P>
<P>
   It was on the courts of Las Canchas in Torrance that strangers
first gathered to behold this wisp of a wonder. It was there two
oracles took his father aside one day and augured his greatness.
Eleven years later, he would become the youngest U.S. Open men's
singles champion.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years later, he towers over tennis, the winner of 62
titles, including 12 Grand Slams.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, he will lead the U.S. against the Czech Republic
in the second round of the Davis Cup at the Forum, not far from
where he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, long before the world had heard of Pete Sampras, his
tennis raised plenty of eyebrows around Southern California and one
inexorable question:
</P>
<P>
   Would his body stretch enough to fit his genius? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   +++ +++ +++
</P>
<P>
   Sampras was 8 when two lawyers saw him returning balls fed to
him by his father, Soterios (Sam), on a court at Las Canchas. They
recommended the family proceed as fast as its Ford Pinto would take
it to the nearby Peninsula Racquet Club for professional
instruction.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had noticed immediately what was obvious even to
Sam, an aerospace engineer unapologetically unconversant in tennis:
His youngest son possessed uncanny coordination and quickness for
someone so young.
</P>
<P>
   In every other way Sampras was a normal kid. His older sister
Stella and older brother Gus dragged their mother and father to the
courts before dinner, and Pete, the third of the couple's four
children, tagged along after them, retrieving balls and thrilling
for any deflected attention.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sampras turned 10, he was routinely practicing with
some of the game's top young players. The Samprases had joined the
Jack Kramer Club in Rolling Hills Estates, which in the late 1970s
and early 1980s was ground zero for the U.S. junior tennis
explosion.
</P>
<P>
   The club boasted more talented kids than television's ``Mickey
Mouse Club'' would some 15 years later. There was Eliot Telscher,
Derrick Rostagno, Lindsay Davenport, Trey Lewis and Jim Pugh, to
name but a few.
</P>
<P>
   Kids at the club called Sampras ``Smiley'' because he was the
carefree exception in a cauldron of cutthroat competition. ``No one
ever talked about him being a great tennis player someday,''
recalled Trey Lewis-Mason.
</P>
<P>
   The reason Sampras didn't immediately register on a lot of the
adults' radar was he wasn't much taller than the net. Too, he was
as thin as the lines on the court. No matter how hard he tried,
Sampras' well-developed skills couldn't camouflage his
underdeveloped physique.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could just kind of tell the guy was special,'' said Eric
Amend, an occasional hitting partner of Sampras' at the Jack Kramer
Club. ``You just didn't know if he was going to grow.''
</P>
<P>
   Amend was 16 and the national champion in his age group when he
first hit with Sampras, who was 10 and so devoid of strength he
gripped his racket with both hands on his forehand and backhand to
generate more oomph.
</P>
<P>
   In those days Stella, who is Pete's senior by two years, was his
primary playing partner. They hit together often and when they kept
score, it tended to be onesided.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to always win,'' said Stella, now the women's coach at
UCLA. ``We played hard. Neither one of us wanted to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   Back then, Stella was about the only one who could wipe the grin
off Pete's face. Sometimes he would grow so frustrated after she
won another point, he'd retrieve the ball and hit it back to her
with such spite, it would sail over her head and ricochet off the
back fence.
</P>
<P>
   Such displays of emotion would disappear along with Sampras'
two-handed forehand and backhand shortly after Pete Fischer entered
his life. No one knew it at the time but ``Smiley'' was about to
become ``Stony.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   +++ +++ +++
</P>
<P>
   Fischer was a pediatrician and a pedestrian tennis player who
was a familiar figure on the Jack Kramer courts. It was hard not to
notice when Fischer was hitting, Amend said, because his form ``was
atrocious.''
</P>
<P>
   One day Fischer approached Sam Sampras at the club. He told him
he saw tremendous potential in Pete and offered to work with him,
free of charge. The father delivered his son to Fischer and receded
into the background.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad saw that Fischer had an unbelievable mind,'' Stella said.
``He just kind of let Fischer take Pete and mold him into the
player he thought he could be.''
</P>
<P>
   One day early in the partnership of the Petes, Fischer enlisted
Lewis-Mason, then in her early 20s and between pro tournaments, to
hit with Sampras so he could work on his groundstrokes. They hit
together occasionally for the next year or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit harder than Pete, but the thing I remember was his
strokes were so solid,'' Lewis-Mason said. ``He could do anything
with the ball _ topspin, slice, volley. When he was 12, he beat me
in one or two close sets. I knew it was the last time I'd be
capable of being on the same court as him.''
</P>
<P>
   John Letts started hitting with him shortly after that. Letts
had just been crowned the boys' 18 national champion. He thought he
was pretty hot stuff. Then he took the court with Sampras.
</P>
<P>
   ``I distinctly remember the first time I hit with Pete,'' Letts
said. ``I'm thinking, `I'll do this little kid a favor and hit
balls with him,' and he comes out hitting good topspin shots on
both sides and a great slice. He was really pounding the balls back
and forth, and his serve wasn't that big, but it had a snap on it
you normally don't see. I was amazed.''
</P>
<P>
   At 17, following his junior year at Palos Verdes High, Sampras
turned pro. In 1989, as a just-turned 18-year-old, he advanced to
the second round of the U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   In February of 1990 Sampras won his first pro title, in
Philadelphia. Seven months later, he shocked the world.
</P>
<P>
   At the 1990 U.S. Open, Sampras upset Ivan Lendl and John McEnroe
and found himself playing Andre Agassi for the championship. Sam
and Georgia Sampras didn't travel to New York for their son's first
Grand Slam final. Instead, they drove to the Del Amo Mall not far
from their Rancho Palos Verdes home and walked off their nervous
energy.
</P>
<P>
   At length they passed a bank of televisions tuned to a channel
showing an awards ceremony. Georgia walked up to a man who was
staring at one of the screens and said, ``Is the U.S. Open men's
final over?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah,'' the man replied. ``The Sampras kid killed Agassi.''
</P>
<P>
   The final score: Sampras, 6-4, 6-3, 6-2. Georgia and Sam let out
a sound that was equal parts revelry and relief. It was safe for
them to return home. Their son was on his way to immortality.

MRS. CLINTON CALLS SCHOOL CUTS A GIULIANI `ADMISSION OF FAILURE' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCKVILLE CENTRE, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton said Wednesday
that plans to sharply cut back summer school in New York City
represented a ``terrible admission of failure'' on the part of
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. She attacked Giuliani's push for teacher
merit pay, the issue that led to the breakdown in talks over the
school program, calling it a crude and ineffective way to improve
public education.
</P>
<P>
   With her remarks, Clinton took the side of one of her most
influential supporters, the United Federation of Teachers, in its
increasingly acrid battle with Giuliani over merit pay. The mayor
has argued for individual teacher stipends based on student test
scores as an incentive for teachers to work this summer and as his
opening move for negotiations with the union, whose contract
expires in November.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute between Giuliani and the union over the incentives
led the interim schools chancellor, Harold O. Levy, to announce
Monday that he was scaling back the number of summer school slots
by nearly 70,000, limiting the program to 250,000 students.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Wednesday that she could support merit pay awarded
to entire schools rather than individual teachers, a position close
to that of the union and Levy. And she said she supported ``pay for
performance,'' a position that, again, resembles the union's, and
would provide extra pay to teachers who take on additional
responsibilities like serving as mentors to other teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said merit pay to individual teachers would discourage
teachers from helping troubled students and would create a
distorted competition among teachers. ``I don't think that's a very
good way to inspire teachers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want our best teachers to work with the kids who are
hardest to teach,'' she added. ``And if teachers are going to be
told that the people who look better on a test, or who please an
administrator more, are the ones who are going to get them rewarded
in their salary or compensation, why would anyone take on the kids
who are harder to teach?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statement offered a strong contrast with Giuliani's
position on an issue that has received increasing attention in New
York's public school system. Giuliani was raising personal campaign
funds in Tennessee on Wednesday, and his campaign aides issued a
statement attacking Clinton and asserting that her position was
evidence that she was too close to the teachers' union.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since Mrs. Clinton shared a stage with the teachers'
union to announce her candidacy, she has been much more concerned
about perks, pay and privilege for union leaders than about
reading, writing and arithmetic for our children,'' said Kim
Serafin, a campaign spokeswoman, in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mrs. Clinton should be embarrassed for placing job protection
before our children's education,'' Serafin said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's statements marked the latest evidence of her
increasingly aggressive stance against Giuliani and her campaign's
intention to try to turn what her aides see as mayoral difficulties
into a Senate race issue.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not suggest that the question of how to staff summer
schools in New York City, or even merit pay, was likely to appear
on the Senate floor any time soon. Nonetheless, her aides have
counseled her to seize on the issue as a way to emphasize two of
her main differences with her opponent: her assertion that he has a
weak record in administering the city schools, and her claim that
he is too belligerent to serve in a collegial body like the Senate.

   ``Let me start by saying how disappointed I am by the mayor's
failure of leadership on the issue of summer schools for the
children of this city,'' Clinton said. ``For me, the idea that we
couldn't get people together under the mayor's leadership to do
what was necessary to provide summer school for every child in the
school district who needed it is a terrible admission of failure on
his part.''

<P>
   The merit pay dispute was one of a number of differences that
emerged between Clinton and Giuliani in a day of exchanges,
conducted at news conferences, across state lines and through
e-mail. Clinton, who began her day appearing at a public school
anti-smoking rally, said she would support expanding a New York
City anti-smoking bill to include, among other things, bars and
clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hesitated at first when asked about enlarging the
existing anti-smoking bill. Mark Green, the city's public advocate,
stepped forward to explain the legislation _ which, in fact, has
not been formally introduced in the City Council _ as Clinton
nodded in approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would vote for it, if I were on the City Council,'' she
said, adding: ``You know, I took some grief for saying that no one
would be permitted to smoke in the White House. I'm sure I'll take
some grief for saying I would vote for this.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Giuliani later said the mayor, who signed the
original legislation, did not consider it necessary to expand
strictures on public smoking, saying the mayor believed the
original legislation struck a proper balance between the rights of
smokers and nonsmokers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, speaking at a news conference after the anti-smoking
rally, also said she was against a proposed constitutional
amendment that would ban flag-burning, asserting that it ran afoul
of the free speech provisions of the First Amendment. Serafin said
Giuliani strongly supported the constitutional amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's main focus, though, was on tobacco. She appeared with
Green at an anti-smoking rally at the Salk School of Science on
East 19th Street, where she attacked the tobacco industry and
endorsed legislation that would authorize the Food and Drug
Administration to treat it as a drug.
</P>
<P>
   Such legislation would overturn a recent Supreme Court ruling
that the agency did not have that authority and would permit the
drug agency to proceed with efforts to restrict tobacco advertising
aimed at youth.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``What the tobacco companies have done is to target children,''
Clinton said at the school. ``And they've done it deliberately.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why do you think that the tobacco companies are still
advertising? Well, because it is legal for them to do that, and
they need to keep getting more customers. They keep having to try
to convince more and more people _ particularly young people _ to
start smoking, because it is addictive.''
</P>
<P>
   As the Clinton-Giuliani campaign continued to churn along at a
rapid pace, Giuliani prepared to announce Thursday that his
campaign fund raising enabled him to start a statewide television
advertising campaign.
</P>
<P>
   It will be unusually early to start a statewide commercial push.
It comes at a time when a series of public polls have shown
Giuliani losing ground to Clinton, and Giuliani's allies suggested
that the advertising was intended, at least in part, to halt those
losses.
</P>
<P>
   And finally, the two sides stepped up, if slightly, their talks
about holding debates, even as aides said privately that it was
highly unlikely that the candidates would actually meet in debate
before the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce J. Teitelbaum, the mayor's campaign manager, sent a letter
to Clinton's campaign manager, Bill de Blasio, politely suggesting
that the two candidates begin conversations on the ground rules for
debates.
</P>
<P>
   De Blasio replied with a sharp response suggesting there would
be no such discussions anytime soon. de Blasio noted that on Feb.
22, Clinton challenged Giuliani to a series of debates across the
state, an offer Teitelbaum had, at the time, dismissed out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry it has taken you so long to respond, but I guess
Giuliani's falling poll numbers necessitated a change in your
strategy,'' de Blasio said.

A BILL TO HALT INSURER TAX FLIGHT TO BERMUDA 
 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Conn., Mass., Calif.)  c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Legislation to prevent property and casualty insurance companies
from avoiding corporate income taxes by moving their corporate
headquarters to Bermuda was introduced Wednesday by three members
of the House Ways and Means Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., , joined with two Democrats,
Richard Neal of Massachusetts and Robert Matsui of California, in
sponsoring the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is outrageous that our own tax system encourages tax dodges
like this,'' Johnson said. She called the Bermuda tax avoidance
device ``a double slap in the face of the American taxpayer,
adding, ``First we lose tax revenue, and then we provide American
companies with an unfair advantage over U.S. companies and American
workers.''
</P>
<P>
   Property and casualty insurers make money from investing
premiums from the time they are collected until they pay claims.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, The New York Times reported that half a dozen U.S.
insurers had moved their corporate headquarters to Bermuda, which
imposes very light taxes, and had left the unprofitable portion of
their business subject to taxation in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Four major U.S. insurers _ Chubb, Hartford, Kemper and Liberty
Mutual _ sought legislation to block the Bermuda tax-avoidance
strategy.

HEAD OF PRIVATE SCHOOL CHARGED WITH EMBEZZLING COUNTY MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN T. McQUISTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROOSEVELT, N.Y. _ For two decades, Ms. Shelley's Upward Prep
School has been a rare source of educational good news _ boasting
high test scores and an emphasis on discipline _ in a Long Island
town whose public schools are now under state control.
</P>
<P>
   But in recent years, bad news has mixed with the good. The small
private school, which once had classes from preschool to grade 12,
has become even smaller, now serving preschool through grade 4. In
January 1999, its founder and executive director, Shelley Williams,
held a forum to quell false rumors that she had been arrested and
jailed.
</P>
<P>
   And Wednesday morning, Williams surrendered to law enforcement
officials to face charges that she had stolen more than $329,000
from day care funds provided by Nassau County.
</P>
<P>
   County officials said her indictment threatened the continuing
survival of the school, which has sought to serve the working poor
in this predominantly black community. Her arrest also came as
another blow to the fight for better education for the children of
Roosevelt, whose failing public schools were placed under the
control of the state Board of Regents five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The children are the ones who will suffer, and the children of
Roosevelt already have enough problems,'' said Frederick E. Parola,
the county comptroller, whose 1998 audit of the school touched off
the investigation, according to the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Williams, 51, a strict disciplinarian who founded her school in
1979 as an alternative to public schools, was charged Wednesday
with four counts of grand larceny, according to a statement by the
Nassau County district attorney, Denis Dillon. Her lawyer, John
Carman, said she had taken an extended leave of absence from her
$175,000-a-year job at the school to focus on her legal defense.
</P>
<P>
   Williams surrendered to law enforcement officials Wednesday
morning at the district attorney's office in Mineola, and was
arraigned Wednesday afternoon in 1st District Court in Hempstead.
If convicted of the charges against her, Dillon said, she could be
sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. Judge George Peck of Nassau
County District Court ordered that she be released on an interim
bond of $5,000, pending the posting of a $40,000 collateral-backed
bond on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Carman, Williams' lawyer, said after the arraignment that
Williams would plead not guilty. ``Any money she took she was
entitled to as compensation for the enormous amount of time she
worked at the day care center,'' he said. ``And all the monies she
spent were in the best interest of the center. The school was her
life. She would do nothing to harm the school.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If anything, it was a matter of poor bookkeeping and
accounting methods,'' Carman said. ``She has committed no crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Dillon said the embezzlement was discovered during an audit of
the school's finances by the county comptroller's office in the
summer of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Williams' school, a nonprofit organization, contracts with
Nassau County to provide day care services for poor children
through the Nassau County Department of Social Services, Dillon
said. The school, which receives about $2 million annually from the
county, received more than $7 million from 1995 to 1998, he said.
</P>
<P>
   During that four-year period, he said, investigators discovered
that Williams had diverted more than $92,000 from school finances
to pay for improvements to her home in an affluent neighborhood of
Old Westbury, including stained glass windows, an automated gate at
the entrance of her property, landscaping and a greenhouse
enclosure.
</P>
<P>
   Williams is also charged with diverting nearly $237,000 from
school funds to her personal bank account. Dillon said that
Williams did this by fraudulently placing family members, including
her now-estranged husband, her adopted daughter and her
now-deceased grandmother, in no-show positions on the school
payroll. She would then feign salary payments to these individuals,
but would divert the money to her personal bank account, Dillon
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the tuition costs for children in low-income families are
paid by government subsidies provided by Nassau County taxpayers,
periodic audits are required by the county comptroller's office.
</P>
<P>
   The comptroller, Parola, said it would be up to the County
Legislature to decide whether Nassau should continue to finance the
program at the school.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Parola said that Williams had cooperated fully with his office
and had complied with many of his auditors' requests for
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has been very cooperative, and our analysis is that she
runs a good program,'' Parola said. The audit report found that the
school had committed ``a serious case of misreporting'' the
expenditure of funds resulting in county overpayments totaling
$1.03 million. He said that Williams had returned nearly $420,000.
</P>
<P>
   Reactions to William's arrest were mixed Wednesday from parents
who send their children to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Joelle Day of Baldwin, who is a teacher in Hempstead, was
picking up her 14-month-old son, Brandon. She said she had
previously sent her daughter, Cristina, to the school, where the
girl learned to read at age 4. ``Academically they are doing what
they have to do,'' she said, adding that Williams' finances ``are
not my concern.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Laysaun, a New York City corrections officer from
Westbury, said he had already decided to pull his 4-year-old son
from the school after Williams recently announced a tuition
increase to $780 a month from $470. ``I knew something right away
was wrong,'' he said.

BILL ADVANCES FOR FINANCING OF CAMPAIGNS BY THE PUBLIC
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Neb., Maine)  By PAUL ZIELBAUER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ A bill forged by state Democrats to provide
public money for state political campaigns and establish voluntary
limits on the amount candidates for those offices should spend was
narrowly approved by Connecticut's House of Representatives
Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, if it survives a vote in the state Senate and the
scrutiny of Gov. John Rowland, whose fellow Republicans in the
House denounced the measure Wednesday as a sham, would put
Connecticut among a select group of states that give public money
to candidates to reduce the influence of special interest groups.
</P>
<P>
   Like existing laws in states like Nebraska and Maine,
Connecticut's bill does not mandate spending limits for political
campaigns, but only suggests voluntary limits, beginning in 2002.
Though candidates would be free to flout the suggested spending
caps _ which range from $50,000 for state House races to $6 million
for a candidates on a gubernatorial ticket _ the bill's Democratic
supporters said public pressure to stay within those limits would
be enormous.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you'd have a lot of explaining to do if you went
beyond the caps,'' said David B. Pudlin, the Democrats' majority
leader in the House.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans vociferously urged the bill's defeat, saying it
would limit political expression and unfairly hurt their candidates
for office. But after nearly five hours of debate, the measure
passed by a vote of 77- 72, largely along party lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The spending limits in this bill are patently unfair,'' said
Robert M. Ward, the Republican House minority leader, ticking off a
Top 10 list of reasons why the bill should be rejected. ``I can't
help think when I look at it, that it's meant to pick on Republican
candidates.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's campaign finance bill represents a compromise
between House and Senate Democrats who in recent weeks achieved
common ground over the issue after each had proposed separate, and
very different, campaign finance proposals earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   It would create voluntary limits on campaigns for almost all
state elective offices, including the joint ticket for governor and
lieutenant governor, attorney general, secretary of state and all
151 seats in the General Assembly, starting in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning in 2006, each gubernatorial ticket could spend up to
$6 million for a primary and general election race, $5.5 million of
which would come from publicly raised funds. In races for the
state's constitutional offices like attorney general, secretary of
state, treasurer and comptroller, candidates could spend up to
$1,325,000, most of which would also come from a state grant.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigns for seats in the legislature would not receive any
public money, but House candidates would face a voluntary spending
cap of $50,000, and Senate candidates would be under a $130,000
cap.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates who disregarded the spending limits would not get
public funds. Candidates who exceeded the limit after taking public
money would be forced to give it back or likely face larceny
charges, although the bill does not address that prospect
specifically.
</P>
<P>
   To discourage candidates from exceeding the voluntary spending
limits, the bill includes a provision that would give complying
candidates a grant equal to the amount of money their opponents
spent beyond the cap. For example, if a House candidate spent
$10,000 more than the cap, the state would give the opponent
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   To help pay for the state's most expensive races, the bill would
create a Citizens' Election Fund, financed largely by voluntary
donations from individual and corporate taxpayers. The bill would
cost the state $3 million to $9.5 million a year in lost tax
revenue, said Rep Alex Knopp, the Democrats' main defender of the
bill on the House floor Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   If approved in the Senate, where Democrats hold a tenuous
19-to-17 majority, the bill would go to Rowland, who has said he
will not favor any campaign finance measure that does not have
bipartisan support.

PORK SPENDING CRITICIZED, DEFENDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Also moving in the ``a'' national news file.) 
By BILL HILLBURG 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Depending on how you slice it, Southern California
Congress members Julian Dixon, Lucille Roybal-Allard and Jerry
Lewis are either wallowing in pork barrel spending or very adept at
bringing home some needed bacon.
</P>
<P>
   The three House members were slammed Wednesday in the ``2000
Congressional Pig Book Summary'' by Citizens Against Government
Waste, a watchdog group.
</P>
<P>
   The book highlighted $17.7 billion in outlays from the 1999-2000
federal budget that were frivolous wastes, said CAGW President
Thomas A. Schatz.
</P>
<P>
   California ranked first among the states in terms of total pork
spending with $676 million but only 29th in per-capita pork -
$20.39 for each Californian compared to the $25.92 national
average.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Democrats Dixon and Roybal-Allard, and Redlands
Republican Lewis all defended their alleged pork as worthwhile
local investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fail to understand their definition of pork,'' said
Roybal-Allard. ``My definition is something that is not needed. But
my projects filled tremendous needs in my district and other areas
of Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Lewis: ``I'm reminded of the saying that `pork barrel' is
that which is at least 100 miles away from your home. To critics,
pork barrel spending is any kind of spending you disagree with.''
</P>
<P>
   CAGW, which has been tracking federal spending since 1991, said
the 1999-2000 total set an all-time record and was up 47 percent
over 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon endured the toughest grilling from CAGW, which gave him
the ``Jurassic Pork Award'' for securing $1 million for the Natural
History Museum of Los Angeles County's planned dinosaur egg
exhibit.
</P>
<P>
   Dixon and Allard-Roybal were criticized for jointly securing
$18.2 million for the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement's
battle against methamphetamine production and trafficking; $2
million for Los Angeles' Better Educated Students for Tomorrow
program, a tutoring and recreation effort; $1 million for LAPD's
family violence response teams; and $500,000 for the L.A. Bridges
anti-gang program.
</P>
<P>
   Roybal-Allard was singled out by CAGW for securing $400,000 in
Housing and Urban Development Department money for such projects as
a $200,000 youth and senior center in Maywood and a $10,000
decorative street gate for Chinatown.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis was criticized for a long list of local programs,
including $4 million for a proton beam accelerator at Loma Linda
University Medical Center, which is used by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration; $3 million to refurbish the
historic San Bernardino train depot; $800,000 for the Redlands
Trolley project; $500,000 for a Discovery Center attraction in Big
Bear; $425,000 each for recreation programs in Highland and
Yucaipa; and $250,000 for Fogelson Pool in Barstow.
</P>
<P>
   CAGW's designated top pig was Sen. Ted Stephens, R-Alaska, who
was credited with raking in $394 million in pork - $636 for each
Alaskan.

ELIAN'S FATHER FLYING TO U.S. FOR REUNION WITH SON 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Juan Gonzalez will arrive in Washington this
morning to begin the process of being reunited with his son Elian,
who survived a daring boat trip from Cuba and became the subject of
a major custody dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Gregory Craig, the father's American attorney, said
Wednesday night he expects Justice Department officials to
``immediately begin'' the process of reuniting father and son after
Gonzalez's arrival at Dulles International Airport in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   But Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said the reunion
process might take time. Federal immigration officials are
continuing to talk with lawyers for Elian's Miami relatives, who
have been caring for the boy, in hopes of negotiating a ``prompt
and orderly way'' for Gonzalez to join the boy, Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig, addressing reporters at his Washington office, saying,
``It is time for this reunion to go forward. ... He is prepared to
stay here until he has achieved that objective.''
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez is to arrive by private plane at the airport in
suburban Washington at 6 a.m. CST with his second wife and infant
son, Craig said.
</P>
<P>
   The pending reunion would mark the latest chapter in a stirring
tale of survival and a family battle over the custody and care of a
6-year-old boy who may have seen his mother drown.
</P>
<P>
   Elian has been living with Miami relatives since his
Thanksgiving Day rescue off the coast of Florida, following an
ill-fated shipboard escape from Cuba in which his mother and 10
others drowned after the boat broke down.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even as Elian lost the love and companionship of his mother
when she died last November, Juan Miguel has lost the love and
companionship of his 6-year-old son for four long months,'' Craig
said. ``The first tragedy cannot be reversed. The second tragedy
can and will be ended.''
</P>
<P>
   Federal immigration officials have said Elian belongs back in
Cuba with his father. But the Miami relatives have strongly
objected, saying Elian's return to the communist dictatorship of
Cuban President Fidel Castro would not be in the boy's best
interest.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. immigration officials have been meeting with the
relatives lawyers in hopes of reaching an agreement under which the
family would surrender Elian to federal authorities or the boy's
father. Negotiations were to resume today.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno has said her first hope is to get a
peaceful and prompt agreement but that she is prepared to send U.S.
marshals, if necessary, to retrieve the boy.
</P>
<P>
   Miami's large population of Cuban expatriates, sympathetic to
the relative's desire to keep the boy in the United States, has
taken to the city's streets to denounce the Clinton administration
for calling for the boy's return to Cuba.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But religious organizations, saying the boy belongs with his
father, retained Craig, a widely respected Washington attorney, to
represent Gonzalez and help coordinate his trip from Cuba to the
United States to be reunited with Elian.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as late Tuesday it appeared the lawyer, who
successfully defended President Clinton during his Senate
impeachment trial last year, would not be able to pull off the
reunion.
</P>
<P>
   Craig flew to Cuba on a private jet Tuesday night to meet with
Gonzalez, who had earlier in the day surprised U.S. supporters when
he said he would not come to the United States unless certain
conditions were met.
</P>
<P>
   Either federal officials give him custody of Elian when he
arrives in the United States and allow him to return to Cuba with
the boy immediately or allow him to bring more than 20
``indispensable'' fellow Cubans with him to the United States,
Gonzalez said on Cuba's state-run television.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, which has granted permission for Gonzalez
and five others to come to the United States, said it has no plans
to let any more people escort Gonzalez when he comes to this
country. Besides Gonzalez, the State Department granted visas to
Elian's step-mother, infant half-brother, favorite cousin, teacher
and pediatrician.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez, after meeting with his lawyer, dropped his demand for
an entourage. Craig, returning to Washington after his day in Cuba,
called his meeting with Elian's father ``a success.''

REFORM PARTY CANDIDATE PAT BUCHANAN VISITS KANSAS CITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE KRASKE  
 c. 2000 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ The Pat Buchanan who ran for president as a
Republican in 1996 sounds a lot like the Pat Buchanan running for
president this year on the Reform Party ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In a visit to Kansas City on Wednesday night, the candidate was
his old rhetorical self, preaching the same anti-abortion,
anti-China trade and anti-immigration gospel that propelled him to
national prominence in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, he bedeviled then-President Bush in the 1992 GOP
primaries, and then Bob Dole four years later. This time around
he's the early favorite to win the nomination of the Ross
Perot-founded Reform Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't change my views and ideas,'' Buchanan said. ``But I do
believe now that the Republican and Democratic establishment are so
similar, so powerful, that if we're going to change this country,
we have to change it from the outside.''
</P>
<P>
   The former aide to Presidents Nixon and Reagan said he was
confident that he could defeat a group of largely unknown rivals
for the Reform Party nod this summer. His confidence may be
bolstered by his belief that Perot will not run again.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd clearly be formidable, but we have no indication that
he's going to'' run, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech to about 50 persons at the Kansas City Airport
Marriott, he emphasized the importance of being included in this
fall's presidential debates. A debate commission has said that to
be included, a candidate must draw 15 percent support in a set of
five polls before the first debate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think we can win if we don't get into the debates,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign has filed a complaint with the Federal Election
Commission over the debate issue. If that proves fruitless,
Buchanan said, he will go to court.
</P>
<P>
   He may be a Reform Party member now, but Buchanan plans to steal
a page from Republican John McCain's playbook this fall by
traveling the country in a bus.

ACCORD IS REACHED IN NEWARK FOR DOWNTOWN SPORTS ARENA
</HEADLINE>
  By ANDREW JACOBS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEWARK, N.J. _ Paving the way for one of the largest development
projects here in decades, the YankeeNets and a major landowner have
struck a deal for a $295 million downtown sports arena that
officials hope will spark the rejuvenation of one of the state's
poorest cities.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement, reached on Tuesday, removes the most serious
obstacle to the project, settling a dispute over whether the arena
_ a new home for the New Jersey Nets and the Devils _ will be built
in the heart of downtown Newark, or 600 feet away, next to the
city's public transportation hub, Pennsylvania Station.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the YankeeNets, which owns the Nets and Devils,
succeeded in moving the arena closer to the station, easing its
concerns that sports fans arriving by train would be loath to walk
through the center of a city that has long been associated with
urban blight.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new plan, those attending basketball or hockey games
will be able to proceed directly from Pennsylvania Station to the
arena through an elevated passageway, eliminating the need to walk
on the street.
</P>
<P>
   Many urban planners have criticized that plan, saying it would
keep visitors bottled up near the station rather than getting them
into the historic center of Newark.
</P>
<P>
   The new plan, however, eliminates a soccer stadium for the New
York-New Jersey MetroStars that had been proposed in earlier plans.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Sharpe James hailed the settlement Wednesday and predicted
that the 18,500-seat arena would be finished within four years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This undertaking will create thousands of new jobs for city
residents, new opportunities for local families and tax ratables
for Newark,'' he said. ``It's a win-win situation for all
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   The completion of the arena would be an astonishing feat for a
city that not long ago was being written off. After decades of
calling itself ``America's Renaissance City'' with few solid signs
of rebirth, Newark is finally enjoying the fruits of the nation's
economic boom. A performing arts center opened here three years ago
to nearly unanimous praise, aging office buildings are being
renovated for dot-com upstarts, and city officials have plans for a
downtown arts and entertainment district.
</P>
<P>
   Although the redevelopment plan, including the condemnation of
about 100 homes and 50 businesses, still requires approval by the
City Council and the Planning Board, Newark officials agreed that
Tuesday's deal had defused a threat by the YankeeNets to build an
arena somewhere else.
</P>
<P>
   A group of residents initially sued the city to stop the
condemnation process, but continuing negotiations between the
residents and the YankeeNets have won over even the most stubborn
opponents.

FIRST A COMMUTER TAX BREAK, NOT A PAPERWORK HEADACHE
</HEADLINE>
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ From New York's highest court, the message was
simple: New York City's commuter tax is no more. But for 340,000
commuters from other states, getting refunds will not be simple,
and will involve a maze of paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   As the deadline for filing income tax returns approaches, it is
not clear whether those commuters, most of them from New Jersey,
will be able to claim their refunds as part of their returns. If
not, or if they have already filed their returns, more paperwork
awaits them, as well as a longer wait to get their money back.
</P>
<P>
   New York's Court of Appeals ruled on Tuesday that state
lawmakers were within their rights last year when they repealed New
York City's tax on the incomes of in-state residents who work in
the city but live outside it. The state, which collects income
taxes for the city, stopped collecting the money from in-state
commuters on July 1, when the law went into effect.
</P>
<P>
   But the law left the tax in place for out-of-state commuters,
and the state continued to collect the levy, 0.45 percent of
taxable income, usually through automatic payroll deduction. The
Court of Appeals said that such discrimination against residents of
other states was unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   The state reckons that commuters from other states now qualify
for $70 million in refunds on tax collected in the second half of
last year _ more than $206 each, on average.
</P>
<P>
   But the New York Department of Taxation and Finance says it
cannot begin helping people get their money back until the Court of
Appeals order is ``entered,'' meaning that it is signed by the
court clerk, returned to the trial court that first heard the case
in Manhattan, and added to the case file. The process usually takes
several days.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves barely a week until tax day, which falls on April 17
because April 15 is a Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are geared up with pamphlets that we will be sending out to
all of the out-of-state taxpayers and to tax preparers,'' said Marc
Carey, spokesman for the state Department of Taxation and Finance.
``But legally, our hands are tied and we can't send that out until
that order is entered.''
</P>
<P>
   Those pamphlets explain how to fill out New York State tax
returns so that the commuter tax paid in the second half of 1999 is
subtracted from the total tax bill. (All taxpayers who work in New
York State must pay New York state and local income taxes, even if
the taxpayer lives in another state, and that will continue. What
has ended is a New York City tax that applied only to noncity
residents.)
</P>
<P>
   If commuters do not receive the pamphlets in time to meet the
filing deadline, they have two choices. They may file 1999 returns
without making the adjustment, and then file amended returns later
to claim the refund. Or they may file for extensions, along with
estimated tax payments, giving them until August to file their
returns.
</P>
<P>
   For people who have already filed their 1999 returns, the only
way to claim the refund is to file an amended return.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the problem of taxes on this year's income,
because$45 million has already been deducted from paychecks through
the first three months of 2000. Rather than wait until year 2000
tax returns are filed next year, the tax department will send each
commuter an application to get the amount paid so far this year
sent back, in the form of a refund check.

 CREDIT BUREAU CUTS OFF E-LOAN'S ACCESS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A major credit reporting agency has forced
Internet lender E-Loan to stop giving consumers a peek at one of
the most jealously guarded secrets in financial services _ their
individual credit scores.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax, one of the nation's three big credit bureaus, cut off
E-Loan's access to the data Monday, six weeks after the Dublin
mortgage provider began letting its customers pull up their own
credit scores online.
</P>
<P>
   The incident marks the latest episode in the credit-reporting
industry's long-standing battle to keep sensitive credit
information out of the hands of consumers. ``They have consistently
fought federal efforts to require disclosure of credit scores,''
said Consumers Union senior attorney Gail Hillebrand.
</P>
<P>
   Credit scores are numerical ratings that calculate the
likelihood a borrower will repay a loan based on the consumer's
past financial record. Designed by Fair, Isaac, the San Rafael
financial software company, they are the most important tool
lenders use when deciding whether to offer a customer credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until E-Loan put the scores online, consumers generally could
learn their ratings only under special circumstances, such as when
they got turned down for loans. ``This was the first time consumers
had ever been granted ready access to their own credit scores,''
said E-Loan Vice President Sharon Ruwart.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan said 20,000 customers opened accounts after it made the
data available.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac and the credit bureaus protect credit scores like
the family jewels. Equifax apparently regarded E-Loan's
distribution of the data as a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to persuade E-Loan to stop posting credit scores,
Equifax turned on Credit InfoNet, the vendor that sells Equifax
data to E-Loan, demanding that the company stop giving credit
scores to E-Loan, said Tom Midkiff, Credit InfoNet's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   When the Credit InfoNet didn't immediately comply, Equifax shut
off the flow of all data to the company Sunday, leaving the vendor
unable to serve any of its 700 customers for parts of two days.
Equifax restored service when Credit InfoNet agreed to stop giving
E-Loan credit scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They strong-armed me to cut off credit scores to E-Loan,''
Midkiff complained.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax, based in Georgia, did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan resumed distributing credit scores yesterday using
another credit bureau, but that service could be suspended, too.
E-Loan declined to identify the bureau, but industry sources said
it was Trans Union. Meanwhile, E-Loan contends that Fair, Isaac
pressured Equifax and was the real agent behind the data cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the San Rafael, Calif., company admits it pressed
the credit bureau to act, noting that its contracts with Equifax,
Trans Union and Experian, the third credit bureau, specifically bar
them from supplying consumers their credit scores under most
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have consistently encouraged the credit reporting agencies
to enforce the contracts,'' said Craig Watts, Fair, Isaac's
consumer affairs manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac said it doesn't want consumers to see their credit
scores because it fears they will misinterpret the numbers.
``Consumers need additional information and counsel from a lender
to truly understand their credit situation,'' said Watts.
</P>
<P>
   The credit industry also worries that consumers will take
shortcuts to jack up their credit scores, just the way some
students cram for college entrance exams. That could cheapen the
value of the data.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates counter that the credit industry simply
doesn't want consumers to cast a critical eye on how a number that
could seal their financial fate is determined. ``They just don't
want the scores demystified,'' said Hillebrand of Consumers Union.

 BIG GENE STEP FOR CELERA, SOURCE SAYS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Celera Corp. is on the verge of announcing that
it has completed a milestone in understanding the human genome,
giving it a leg up in its race against the federally funded Human
Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   A well-placed source said Celera has finished reading the
sequence of letters that spell out the human genetic code and will
announce it any day.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would not mean that the genome race is over. Celera
will still face the daunting task of assembling all its information
_ the genome has 3 billion letters _ into a neat arrangement of
genes and chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the government's Human Genome Project recently
finished reading two-thirds of the genome and isn't expected to
finish until June.
</P>
<P>
   Celera President Craig Venter is scheduled to testify today
before the same House subcommittee on energy and the environment
that questioned him in June 1998, shortly after he announced the
formation of Celera.
</P>
<P>
   That hearing was called to ascertain whether Celera's private
genome hunt threatened to disrupt the public project and monopolize
the human blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Venter told House members his new company intended
to publish its human genome data and only intended to file between
150 and 300 patents on new genes it might discover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, however, press accounts have said Celera has
filed provisional applications to patent as many as 10,000 gene
sequences. The company said the reports are misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has also drawn heat for not fulfilling Venter's pledge to
publish its human genome data.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his congressional testimony, Craig promised to release his
data quarterly,'' scientist Robert Waterston told The Chronicle
recently. ``I've not seen any of his (human) data in the public
domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterston, who directs the Genome Sequencing Center at
Washington University in St. Louis, and is one of five top
scientists in the government Human Genome Project, is scheduled to
testify alongside Venter.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the witness list will be University of California at
Berkeley geneticist Gerry Rubin, who recently collaborated with
Celera in pulling off the biggest genome coup so far _ publication
of all the genes in the fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential science adviser Neal Lane will be the fourth
speaker at today's hearing, which will also discuss the 37 percent
drop in biotechnology industry shares since last month, when a
White House staffer mistakenly suggested President Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair didn't want human genes to be
patented.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did his best to set the record straight and repair the
damage yesterday by clarifying his position on gene discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Blair and I crashed the markets for a day or two and I
didn't mean to,'' Clinton told reporters, adding, ``Where public
money contributed to basic research, we ought to get it (gene
information) out there. If someone did it with private money, they
ought to get a patent on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's clarification sent Celera shares skyrocketing 55
percent and sparked smaller gains for firms like Palo Alto's Incyte
Genomics and Massachusetts' Millennium Pharmaceuticals. They
compete with Celera in the field of genomics _ the application of
genetic knowledge to drug discovery and development.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional source said that although Venter will be asked
to clarify his own testimony from June 1998, ``the hearings were
not set up to be explosive.'' Rubin, for instance, is expected to
praise Celera for publicly revealing all the genes in the fruit
fly, an organism scientists study as a simple model of human
development.
</P>
<P>
   A source at Celera said Venter will say his firm can't provide
public access to its genome data until it's finished _ mainly
because it would aid commercial competitors like Incyte, while
potentially discouraging scientific journals from publishing
Celera's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Venter is also expected to state that his firm only plans to
patent about 300 genes, far fewer than its competitors, and that it
plans instead to make money by providing software tools to analyze
and compare genes.

NEW-LOOK RANGERS, SAME OLD PITCHING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ With or without Juan Gonzalez, it's still the
American League. Any talk of pitching duels coming soon to The
Ballpark in Arlington has been premature so far.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers are still in their outslug-the-opposition mode, only
yesterday they couldn't quite finish the job. The Chicago White
Sox, after blowing a 7-1 lead, scored five runs in the top of the
ninth inning to defeat the Rangers, 12-8.
</P>
<P>
   There were 28 hits, 11 walks, four errors and 346 pitches in the
31/2-hour game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day to be a vendor, the last two days,'' Rangers
manager Johnny Oates said. ``You can make a lot of money in 31/2
hours. They have to be sold out in the concession stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Three games into the season, Oates is almost worn out in his
bullpen. He tried to get an extra inning out of Jeff Zimmerman
yesterday, and it didn't work. Instead, the White Sox roughed up
Zimmerman and Francisco Cordero to get their five runs in the
ninth.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had just tied the score 7-7 in the bottom of the
eighth. But Chris Singleton, leading off the ninth, jumped on a
first-pitch fastball from Zimmerman and smashed it into the
right-field seats for a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we could have held them there, we definitely would have
won,'' first baseman David Segui said. ``Some days you do; some
days you don't. But I don't think there was a time at any point of
the game where we didn't think we had a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, but it got pretty bleak from there. Carlos Lee
walked and later scored on Ray Durham's two-out single. After
Zimmerman walked Jose Valentin, Oates tried Cordero, but Frank
Thomas hit a two-run double, and Paul Konerko delivered a
run-scoring single.
</P>
<P>
   ``I lost a little bit of my aggressiveness,'' Zimmerman said.
``I started to nibble at the corners rather than going after
hitters.''
</P>
<P>
   Zimmerman had pitched well until the ninth. Entering the seventh
with one out and runners at second and third, he kept the White Sox
from scoring by striking out Josh Paul and Ray Durham. Valentin led
off the eighth with a double, but Zimmerman got Thomas and Magglio
Ordonez on fly balls and struck out Konerko.
</P>
<P>
   Oates had closer John Wetteland warmed up going into the ninth
but, with his bullpen thin from Tuesday's 12-8 battle, he was
hoping to get one more inning out of Zimmerman. Oates said if the
game were still tied in the 10th, Wetteland would have pitched.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was my last bullet,'' Oates said. ``Zimmerman was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Zimmerman: ``I felt great. I wanted to go out there for the
ninth.''
</P>
<P>
   The bullpen became thin because starter Darren Oliver struggled
early, allowing four runs in the first two innings. Two of the four
runs got on base by drawing walks.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really no excuse for walks out there,'' Oliver said.
``If you put guys on base, you want to make them earn it.''
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox added three more runs off Oliver in the fifth
before Oates brought in long reliever Matt Perisho.
</P>
<P>
   Ivan Rodriguez's two-run single and Rafael Palmeiro's three-run
homer in the fifth made it a 7-6 game. The Rangers then tied it in
the eighth on singles by Segui and Frank Catalanotto, and Durham's
throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Chad Curtis' leadoff homer in the ninth backed up Segui's belief
the Rangers could have won it if they had held the White Sox in the
ninth. But this is the American League. You can never stop
slugging. nn

 GATEWAY, AOL SHOW WEB UNITS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what could be the biggest challenge yet to
Microsoft's domination of the home computing market, America Online
and PC maker Gateway unveiled a trio of sub-$500 Internet-access
devices yesterday based on the Linux operating system instead of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to ship within the next year, the three devices will
deliver ``nearly all'' the features that have attracted some 23
million Windows and Mac users to AOL, including e-mail, proprietary
content, Web access, chat and instant messaging, according to a
joint announcement at the Internet World trade show in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup will include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``countertop'' appliance intended for the kitchen or family
room. Designed to be mounted on any flat surface, it will have a
flat-panel touchscreen and come with a wireless keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   _ A larger desktop appliance, including keyboard, mouse and
conventional screen, designed to serve as a simpler, less expensive
alternative to an extra PC in households where multiple family
members want to get online simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   _ A wireless Web pad, weighing less than three pounds, that can
be used anywhere within the home. Like a cordless phone, it will
connect to a compact base station that in turn is connected to a
phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   While the first two are expected to ship by the end of the year,
the wireless pad won't be available until early next year, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware, which will carry a Gateway label but will be
marketed by both companies, is intended to supplement, not replace,
desktop computers in the home, according to AOL spokeswoman Anne
Bentley. Because the devices won't have any built-in storage
capability, users won't be able to install additional software or
save files; they won't even be able to print documents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the new products will put AOL and Gateway in a
strong position within the emerging ``information appliance''
category, but hedged their bets about how soon that market will
take off. ``These aren't going to be earthshaking products anytime
in the near future,'' said Kevin Hause, director of consumer
research at International Data Corp., ``but they do have the
potential to establish leadership in an area that will be important
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Reynolds, vice president of Dataquest, was more cautious
about the devices' near-term prospects. ``It's kind of neat to poke
around with one of these things while lying in bed or watching
TV,'' he said, speaking of the wireless Web pad, ``but we've yet to
see really compelling applications for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``it's good that they're trying _ if anyone has
a chance of making a strike, these are the companies who do.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Gateway will, however, face plenty of competition in the
appliance category. Several smaller companies, including Austin,
Texas-based Netpliance, already offer such devices.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Microsoft showed off prototypes of similar products
called ``Web companions,'' based on its Windows CE operating system
and designed for its Microsoft Network Internet service; companies
showing samples including Acer and Compaq. In January, Intel
announced plans to join the fray, and IBM followed in February.
</P>
<P>
   The new browser that will be built into the AOL-Gateway
appliances will also be available for conventional computers, under
the name Netscape 6. Free ``preview'' versions for Windows, Mac and
Linux were posted yesterday at www.netscape.com.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's own software for Windows and Macs currently includes a
customized version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. But yesterday,
Steve Case, CEO of the giant service, said he wants to make Gecko
its default browser as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement under which AOL licenses Internet Explorer runs
out at the end of this year.

HEALTH GROUPS URGE USE OF COMMON ANTIBIOTIC IN FIGHT AGAINST AIDS
IN AFRICA
</HEADLINE>
  (SUBS 1st two grafs to change ``AIDS virus'' to ``virus that causes
AIDS''; CORRECTS ``in Africa'' to ``abroad'' and adds ``next year's
budget'' in 4th graf; INCORPORATES last graf into new six graf
insert at end of story.) 
 
By DONALD G. McNEIL Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ The 23 million Africans infected with the virus that
causes AIDS should be given regular doses of a common and
affordable antibiotic to ward off fatal secondary infections, the
World Health Organization and the U.N. AIDS program said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The groups based their recommendation on encouraging preliminary
studies, and added that if the results are borne out, the impact
could be dramatic. Virtually all of those infected with the virus
will still die prematurely of AIDS, the groups said, but many could
add years to their lives and have longer gaps between debilitating
complications.
</P>
<P>
   The drug, known as trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or as
cotrimoxazole, is marketed as a generic medicine in the United
States, treating a variety of ailments including urinary tract
infections and bronchitis; it is best known as Bactrim, a trademark
of Roche Pharmaceuticals. In Africa, ongoing use of the drug can
cost as little as $8 a year per patient. Its use as a preventive
measurein Africa was endorsed for the first time last week by AIDS
experts who convened in Zimbabwe to assess the studies.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is spending more than $100 million to
fight AIDS abroad and is trying to raise that to $325 million in
next year's budget. It may spend millions of those dollars to help
distribute Bactrim in Africa, but has not yet calculated how much
to commit.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did some of the original work on this, and we're extremely
enthusiastic about it,'' said Dr. Helene Gayle, director of the
AIDS division of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
``It's cost-effective, it's ready to roll, and it may become an
important component of the program. But upfront we can't make any
cost projections yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Endorsing the drug was ``a difficult decision because the
research is not definite yet,'' said Dr. Peter Piot, executive
director of UNAIDS, a joint program under the World Health
Organization that includes a number of U.N. agencies, including
UNICEF. But, Piot added, ``This drug, which is widely available and
affordable, can prolong the life of HIV-infected people and improve
their quality of life.''
</P>
<P>
   For years Bactrim has been prescribed in wealthy countries to
ward off pneumocystic carinii pneumonia, which was once a primary
killer of Americans with AIDS. In Africa, its use seems to be
appropriate in handling bacterial pneumonias, diarrheal diseases
and some septicemias, and perhaps against parasitic infections of
the brain and intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Because the studies have been brief, it is impossible to say
what the long-term effects will be, warned Dr. Badara Samb, a
medical care adviser at UNAIDS. But a one-year study in the Ivory
Coast found that Bactrim cut death rates by 50 percent among the
group that took it, he said, and a second study in the same country
found that it cut the number of dangerous complications like bouts
of diarrhea or pneumonia by 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't know what will happen in five years, but we can't
wait for five years to find out,'' Samb said. ``Gaining even six
months of life is not negligible _ and six months when people are
not in bed, sick, all adds to the quality of their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   More recent studies in South Africa and Malawi were also
optimistic that the drug was effective and could be safely given to
HIV-infected Africans, who normally have more meager diets than
Americans, have less access to clean water and do more physical
labor, and are subject to more parasitic disease.
</P>
<P>
   There are 23 million people infected with HIV in Africa, and the
rate of new infections is estimated to be 100 times that of the
United States. In some countries, as many as 25 percent of all
adults are infected, and in Botswana, the country with the highest
rate, AIDS has slashed life expectancy from nearly 70 years to 41,
according to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Only a tiny number of Africans can afford the $15,000 annual
cost of the ``cocktails'' of drugs that can prevent the infection
from progressing to full AIDS. Many African countries have national
annual medical budgets of as little as $6 per citizen. No public
health system and almost no employers pay for protease inhibitors
or other expensive drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Many Africans who develop AIDS die rapidly of common
complications such as tuberculosis or malaria. Both diseases are
usually treatable with relatively inexpensive drugs, though many
Africans may be unable to reach urban hospitals that could provide
these medicines, and in very poor countries, even urban hospitals
may lack them.
</P>
<P>
   Others fall prey to parasitic diseases endemic in parts of the
continent. Bactrim seems to be able to ward off or slow down many
of these diseases.
</P>
<P>
   UNAIDS and WHO acknowledged that the more the drug is used, the
more danger there is of creating germs resistant to it. But the
benefits were judged to outweigh that risk.
</P>
<P>
   In wealthy countries, the use of Bactrim to prevent pneumocystis
carinii pneumonia may start to decline. A Swiss study cited in the
New England Journal of Medicine a year ago found that the
triple-therapy cocktail was so effective that Bactrim was
unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Although India, Bangladesh, Thailand and other Asian countries
have an AIDS epidemic rivaling Africa's, the World Health
Organization and Unaids did not yet recommend the preventive use of
Bactrim there, awaiting more studies.
</P>
<P>
   Bactrim costs as little as 21 cents per pill in the United
States, and with bulk buying by health agencies for Africa,
preventive use can cost $8 to $17 a year per patient. It is already
widely available in Africa as a treatment for childhood pneumonia
and bacterial diarrhea.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you asked caregivers there about it, more than 99 percent
of them would know the drug,'' said Samb, who is from Senegal.
``I'd say you'd have an 80 percent chance of finding it in a
village pharmacy.''
</P>
<P>
   Doctors Without Borders, the Nobel Prize-winning group of
doctors working in poor countries and pressing for global access to
inexpensive drugs, backed the decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bactrim is very cheap, and it's not too complicated to
implement, so if they have good data on mortality, I'm sure it's a
good decision,'' said Bernard Pecoul, director of the group's
Access to Essential Medicines campaign.

 APPROVAL SEALS DON'T GUARANTEE PROTECTED DATA  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Almost everyone who uses the Internet fills out
forms, even if they don't buy anything. Name, address, e-mail
address, age, even income level _ most people part with all this
information and more without thinking twice. But federal regulators
and consumer groups are worried about what Web pages do with all
that information.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies sell or trade the details to other companies or
use it to send unsolicited sales e-mail. Others combine it with
information about an individual's Web-surfing habits and use it to
build lengthy files about the person and their spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Internet companies are trying to reassure both
users and regulators about the use of the information by forming
groups, such as Truste of Cupertino and the Better Business
Bureau's BBBOnline, whose privacy seals adorn thousands of Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But having a seal from one of these groups doesn't mean much,
say privacy advocates. Truste, BBBOnline and the new
Personalization Consortium, which said yesterday that it would
offer its own privacy seal of approval, don't tell their member
sites not to collect information about users. Each simply requires
the sites to list their policies, which could include selling names
and e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Truste) only requires that Web sites disclose their
practices, no matter how invasive or objectionable they are,'' said
Jason Catlett, founder of privacy consulting and advocacy firm
Junkbusters in Greenbrook, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Truste members don't even have to agree not to link actual
names, addresses and phone numbers to anonymous Web users _ a
practice so controversial that it caused public outrage when Web-ad
giant DoubleClick considered it earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage caught the attention of the government, which was
already moving toward regulating Internet privacy. The Federal
Trade Commission is investigating the privacy practices of
DoubleClick, and several bills dictating Internet users' privacy
rights have been drafted in Congress. Members of the U.S. House of
Representatives have proposed forming a 17-member commission to
consider Internet privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's already too late (for Internet companies to set
privacy rules),'' said Christopher Kelly, an associate researcher
with Forrester Research. ``It's been about three years now that the
government has been looking into this, and it's been about three
years that the industry's been dragging its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Personalization Consortium is composed of 26 companies _
including DoubleClick _ that are involved in collecting data about
Net users.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick _ the ad agency that puts banner ads atop most Web
sites _ gathers information such as where Web users shop and browse
in order to show those users ads that are targeted to individual
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, someone who has bought dog toys at Pets.com in the
past might start seeing ads for Dog Chow pop up as they surf, while
someone who spends time at ESPN.com might start seeing ads for
soccer shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Other members of the Personalization Consortium, such as
eCustomers.com, provide technology to Web sites that want to
provide personalized content to users.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 90 days, the consortium's founding members will
draft guidelines that all members will have to adopt. But the
group's co-chairman, Larry Poneman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, did
not say that the new group's standards would be any tougher than
those of Truste and BBBOnline.
</P>
<P>
   To become a member of Truste, all a Web site operator has to do
is post a privacy policy telling users two things:
</P>
<P>
   1) What data is being collected and what is going to be done
with it.
</P>
<P>
   2) How users can ``opt out,'' or prevent personally identifiable
information about them from being used or shared by a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   BBBOnline has similar standards.
</P>
<P>
   Truste members also aren't required to mention the practices of
their advertising partners, such as DoubleClick, which do much of
the information collecting on the Internet. Although the Web site
you're using might have promised not to sell your name and address,
clicking on an ad puts you in the hands of an advertising company,
which might not be as scrupulous about your privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Truste has formed a committee to create guidelines for what Web
sites must disclose about their advertising partners.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates complain that none of the groups enforce their
standards. Seal-of-approval programs aren't monitors that patrol
the Web relentlessly, searching for violations. They make their
membership decisions mostly based on questionnaires filled out by
the Web sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Web site gets the seal, the programs depend largely on
customer complaints to point out violations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither BBBOnline, Truste or even Secure Assure, a less
well-known and slightly stricter program, have ever revoked a seal
from a member because of privacy violations. BBBOnline had to kick
out one Web site, but that was because the site failed to pay its
membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do as much as we can ourselves, but obviously that's very
difficult for any of these privacy seal programs,'' said Phil
Lockwood, CEO of Secure Assure, which employs four people to
oversee member compliance. ``We rely heavily on consumer input,''
Lockwood said. Truste in particular has come under intense
criticism because sites that have been caught violating users'
privacy continue to bear the Truste seal. In one case last
November, Truste member RealNetworks was found to be monitoring the
music listening choices of users of its RealJukebox software. But
Truste did not revoke RealNetworks' membership, saying that its
agreement covers only Web sites, not software downloaded from
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Truste is also working toward a standard that would include such
cases, said Bob Lewin, Truste's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Consortium's Poneman, who created PricewaterhouseCoopers'
privacy practice, said the group's seal will be more meaningful
than Truste and BBBOnline because members will be periodically
audited by an outside company to prove that they are complying with
their own privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Staff at Truste and BBBOnline do look at applicants' Web
sites, and occasionally even test sites' compliance by posing as
consumers. But Truste has 20 staff members to keep an eye on its
2,000 members. BBBOnline has three full-time staffers watching its
238 members.
</P>
<P>
   Truste said it calls in an independent audit on members only if
a user complains, while BBBOnline has Underwriters Laboratories
Inc. perform random audits to see if member sites are living up to
its standards.

 REPORT ON GENETICALLY ALTERED FOODS BLASTED AS PRO-INDUSTRY  By TOM &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A scientific panel that waded into the debate
over genetically engineered foods yesterday drew fire from
environmental opponents for taking a narrow, pro-industry view of
the possible human and environmental risks posed by gene-splicing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a 261-page report issued Wednesday, a 12-person National
Research Council panel said it ``was not aware of any evidence
suggesting foods on the market today are unsafe to eat as a result
of genetic modification.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering involves the transfer in a laboratory of
genes from one plant or animal into a crop. Traditional plant
breeding tries to introduce new genes through pollen transfer, or
sexual reproduction, from one plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists, who spent a year hammering out a consensus
report, said the Environmental Protection Agency should revise, and
then implement, a genetic plant review process which it proposed in
1994 but hasn't completed.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested revision involves EPA's proposed exemption of
plant breeders who use sexual reproduction to introduce alien genes
into a crop. The panel questioned why the review process focused
solely on gene-splicing.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also said EPA needed to work more closely with the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, two other agencies involved in the review processs,
to improve safety testing and alleviate concerns that genetically
modified foods might pose health or environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists acknowledged that their report focused only gene
modifications that make plants resistant to pests and diseases. It
did not study other common types of alterations, such as adding
genes to make plants herbicide-resistant or improve their vitamin
content.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the report discuss whether genetically modified foods
should be labeled, a move opponents have demanded to alert people
who may be afraid of allergic reactions to new genes or who simply
don't like the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the report was issued, environmentalists complained
that the committee was stacked to favor agribusiness. The
committee's original staff director, for instance, is now a
lobbyist for the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the conflicts of this study, this is not credible as an
independent scientific report,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal
director of the Center for Food Safety in Washington, D.C. His
group has filed federal lawsuits challenging the FDA and other
regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Oh) and Rep. Jack Metcalf (R-Wa), who
have coauthored bills to force the labeling of genetically modified
foods, also accused the panel of pro-industry ``bias.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference where the report was released, panel
chairman Perry Adkisson, an entomologist and chancellor emeritus at
Texas A&AMP;M University, stressed that the report reflected a
consensus view that included the opinions of Rebecca Goldburg, a
scientist with Environmental Defense in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the extraordinarily strong feelings on all sides ...
it's not surprising that our work has come under such strong
scrutiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Goldburg acknowledged that ``the committee members
worked hard to get out a consensus recommendation,'' she declined
to give the report a ringing endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should look at the criticisms and look at the report
and draw their own conclusions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is available at www.nas.edu.

EDITORIAL: RESISTING CHANGE IN ZIMBABWE  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times says in an editorial Thursday, April 6: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of blighted hope and slow decay in Zimbabwe, a
fledgling democracy movement seems to have captured popular support
and is threatening to topple the established order. But change will
be neither easy nor, it now appears, free of violence. President
Robert Mugabe, struggling for political survival, is playing a
cynical and dangerous game, promoting violent intimidation and
race-baiting in the face of an extraordinary political alliance
between blacks and whites in what was once Ian Smith's Rhodesia.
</P>
<P>
   Last weekend 200 thugs wielding clubs and machetes attacked
several thousand peaceful anti-government demonstrators in Harare,
the capital. Deployed by Mugabe's ruling ZANU-PF party, they hurled
stones and beat protesters, mostly whites, in an overwhelmingly
black crowd. In recent weeks black squatters have occupied more
than 800 white-owned farms. The country's High Court ordered the
police to evict them. But Mugabe has refused, warning of ``very,
very severe'' violence if farmers ``provoke'' the squatters.
</P>
<P>
   Land distribution is a legitimate issue in Zimbabwe, a legacy of
British colonial rule. The country's whites, less than 1 percent of
the population, own more than half of the most fertile land. But
the way to remedy this is not with threats of violence and illegal
squatting. More than a million acres acquired from whites for
redistribution to landless peasants have instead been given to just
400 people, many of them cronies of Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwe is bracing for its most competitive parliamentary
election since 1980. Zimbabweans recently defeated a constitutional
referendum that would have strengthened Mugabe's powers. The vote
illuminated widespread disaffection with corruption, fuel
shortages, high inflation and unemployment, as well as with a
military intervention in Congo that is sapping the treasury while
enriching generals and cabinet ministers.
</P>
<P>
   The fledgling Movement for Democratic Change represents an
unusual collaboration between blacks and whites who have the
financial wherewithal to promote it. Mugabe has often resorted to
intimidation to secure his power. But a recent poll showed that
four out of five Zimbabweans no longer blamed whites for the
country's problems. Instead, 70 percent blamed the government.
Mugabe needs to cease this ugly business and spare his country
further bloodshed. (af)

FOR OATES, BAD PITCHING ISN'T A LAUGHING MATTER

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ Rangers manager Johnny Oates is the last guy
you'd expect to be doing standup comedy, but there he was
yesterday, making like Jerry Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good news is that we've scored 29 \Ractually 30\S runs,''
Oates cracked, suppressing a half-hearted smile. ``The bad news is,
we've given up 24.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. That's no laughing matter.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's tedious 12-8 loss to the White Sox at The Ballpark
in Arlington on the heels of Tuesday night's come-from-behind 12-8
victory left fans with an uneasy and familiar feeling of deja vu.
</P>
<P>
   The concern after the Rangers lost Juan Gonzalez, Todd Zeile and
Tom Goodwin in the off-season was whether they could still score
enough runs with diminished firepower.
</P>
<P>
   Pitching was not supposed to be the problem after general
manager Doug Melvin signed free-agent left-handers Kenny Rogers and
Darren Oliver and traded for Justin Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Oates elected to break camp with 12 hurlers and a
seven-man bullpen. Three games into the season we're left to wonder
if even that will be enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually it will be,'' Oates said, sounding as if he might
be trying to convince himself as well. ``If not, we're all in
trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Hear, hear.
</P>
<P>
   Oates' bullpen was hurting even before yesterday's debacle by
starter Darren Oliver and a cast of thousands. Oates said before
the game that Tim Crabtree and Mike Munoz would not pitch and that
he hoped to avoid using either Mike Venafro or Francisco Cordero.
The latter two would both be pressed into action anyway, much to
Oates' chagrin.
</P>
<P>
   He had hoped to get by with long man Matt Perisho, followed by
Jeff Zimmerman and, for one inning if needed, closer John
Wetteland. But that was before an erratic 102-pitch, 42/3-inning
performance by Oliver.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back-to-back days like this, especially early, makes it a
little bit tougher,'' Oates said. ``You really are cautious not to
extend anybody too much, and everybody has to carry their load.''
</P>
<P>
   Some aren't doing that.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran starters and a talented bullpen were expected to be two
of the team's strong points. But the 'pen has question marks, too.
Wetteland and Venafro were injured for much of the spring.
Zimmerman was trying to find himself again after struggling down
the stretch last season.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, poor outings by starters Rick Helling on Tuesday and
Oliver yesterday left Oates wondering where to turn next.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are magnified right now because it's just three days
into the season,'' Oates said. ``We know we're going to have days
like today. We know we're going to have days like yesterday when we
don't pitch well and we still win. And we're going to have a few
days like Opening Day, when we do everything right.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if we're going to average nine] runs all year. I
know we're going to pitch better than we are right now.''
</P>
<P>
   That, Oates admitted, will be good news to everyone but the
concessionaires.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good day to be vendors the last two days,'' he said,
doing Seinfeld again. ``You can make some money in 31/2 hours. They
have to be sold out in the concession stands.''
</P>
<P>
   The answer to the bullpen dilemma is simple enough: Better
starting pitching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we were counting on,'' Oates said. ``It's early
but it doesn't matter whether it's April, July or September, you
can't keep going like this. You've got to get it straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't come to the ballpark every day worrying about how I'm
going to finish the game if we get into trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   If there was a place to nitpick Oates' strategy yesterday,
considering his paper-thin bullpen, it came in the ninth when he
allowed Zimmerman, who had looked sharp for two innings, to go back
to the mound after the Rangers had tied the score at 7-all in the
eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Oates could have called on Wetteland for his one inning, hoping
that his closer could hold the White Sox off and that the Rangers
would win it in the bottom of the inning. But Oates didn't feel he
had that luxury.
</P>
<P>
   ``\RWetteland\S was the last bullet I had,'' he said, ``and Zim
said he felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't feel so good after Chris Singleton hit his first pitch
into Home Run Porch, the first salvo in what would be a five-run
inning that forced Oates to use both Cordero and Venafro after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put a first-pitch fastball right on a tee, and
\RSingleton\S whacked it,'' Oates said. ``After that, he got
tired.''
</P>
<P>
   By that time, you could say that about all of us.

 MAC Q&AMP;A COLUMN: MAC MODEMS CAN PERFORM BETTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR;   &LR; I recently purchased a blueberry iMac with Mac OS 9. My
problem is that I can never get above 26 to 28 kilobits  &LR; cq  &LR; per
second on the ``56K'' internal modem. Previously, when I used a
Performa 6115 with a 56K external modem (US Robotics Sportster), I
always got between 48K and 52K, so I figure it can't be the
telephone lines ... or could it? What can I do to get the modem up
to speed?
</P>
<P>
   A: If it's any consolation, you're not alone. Many buyers of
recent iMacs report similar problems, as do some users with iBooks,
PowerBooks and even Power Mac G4s.
</P>
<P>
   Two indispensable Mac Web sites, MacInTouch and MacFixIt
(www.macintouch.com/modemproblems.htmlimac and
www.macfixit.com/ultimate/Forum7 /HTML/000662.html), have collected
scores of reports on the subject. It's also been discussed
regularly on Apple's Tech Exchange support bulletin board
(discuss.info.apple.com/boards /imac.nsf/by+Topic?Openview).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all this discussion hasn't produced any easy
answers. Apple's responses so far, in the Tech Exchange forum and
in tech notes at til.info.apple.com /techinfo.nsf/artnum/n24482 and
til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf /artnum/n43079, cite myriad factors
that can affect the speed of dial-up connections, but they don't
confront the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   As in your case, most users posting the complaints say they've
seen much better performance over the same phone lines, usually to
the same Internet service provider, with older Macs _ even earlier
iMacs _ and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the problem is clearly with Apple's recent
modems, even though the company has so far refused to accept
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   At least according to some Apple technicians, the root cause is
that the modem chips Apple's been using recently implement V.90,
the international standard for 56-Kbps modem connections, in a way
that's not fully compatible with chips from other manufacturers in
V.90 modems used by many Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   What then to do? Some technical users have improved things by
tweaking the scripts that control modem settings. Other folks
report good luck with alternative scripts that have been posted at
several Web sites, particularly those developed by Ross Barkman
(www.taniwha.cwc.net/).
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, none of this should be necessary, especially
considering that Apple markets its machines as the ``fastest,
easiest way to the Internet.'' To my mind, the company owes it to
you and other customers to acknowledge the problem and fix it _
ideally with a software fix, but if necessary with a free hardware
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Discounts
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last month, you complained that Apple charges $99 for System
7.6. Why didn't you point out that you can get it for much less
than that at several discount dealers, including Sun Remarketing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Good point. Sun Remarketing of Logan, Utah, has been selling
old Apple hardware and software since Apple II days, and it has
System 7.6/7.6.1 on CD-ROM for $39. Call (800) 821-3221 or surf
over to www.sunrem.com, scroll down to the ``Software'' heading on
the left side of the page, click on the ``System'' link, then
scroll again until you get to System 7.6 _ or almost any other
version of the Mac OS you might be interested in. (In case you're
wondering, Sun Remarketing has no connection to Sun Microsystems,
the server and workstation manufacturer.)
</P>
<P>
   Other readers noted, correctly, that local Apple dealers often
have copies of old system-software releases and might sell one at a
reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  USB, FireWire
</P>
<P>
   Q: A couple of months ago, you compared IDE and SCSI hard
drives. But what about USB and FireWire, the new interfaces Apple
is pushing? I'm starting to see a lot of drives for both of those
technologies. How do they compare with IDE and SCSI?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both USB and FireWire have one huge advantage over either IDE
and SCSI: They offer true plug-and-play convenience. You usually
have to install some software first, but once you've done that, you
can plug in an external USB or FireWire drive anytime, without
having to power down your system and without worrying about
``master'' and ``slave'' jumper settings (IDE) or ID numbers and
termination settings (SCSI).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that common virtue, USB and FireWire have very different
attributes. The problem with using USB for connecting drives is
that it wasn't designed for that purpose; it was created as an
interface for devices such as keyboards, printers and floppy
drives, which transfer data slowly anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With the current form of USB (Version 1.1), throughput is
limited to 12 megabits, or 1.5 megabytes, of data per second, and
that's only in theory; the reality, for any Mac USB device I've
seen, is well under 1 megabyte per second.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for floppy drives, and perhaps tolerable for Zip
drives and very slow CD-ROM drives and burners. But any hard drive
or any recent CD-ROM device can deliver data much faster than USB
can handle. Yes, such devices can be adapted to work with USB, but
at the expense of most of the speed they're capable of.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I'd recommend USB storage devices, except
floppy drives, only to users who have no choice: specifically, to
owners of all 1998 and 1999 iMacs plus the current $999 blueberry
version.
</P>
<P>
   Because those models don't have SCSI or FireWire, and there's no
room for a second IDE drive, USB is the only way to add an extra
storage (unless, of course, you have a network with a file server).
</P>
<P>
   If you have a new iMac DV or a Power Mac G4, you have the option
of using FireWire (a.k.a. IEEE 1394) as a way to hook up external
drives. On the face of it, FireWire offers the best of both worlds:
the same kind of plug-and-play convenience you get with USB, plus
throughput of up to 400 megabits, or 50 megabytes, per second.
That's more than any single drive today can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the reality is a little different. There are
actually no true, ``native'' FireWire storage devices on the market
today.
</P>
<P>
   The products marketed as FireWire or 1394 drives by VST
Technologies, LaCie, APS Tech and a growing list of others are
really IDE drives combined with ``bridge chips'' _ special
circuitry that translates between the IDE and 1394 formats. That's
true even of the 1394 products recently announced by Western
Digital, which (unlike the other FireWire drive vendors) actually
manufactures its own hard disks.
</P>
<P>
   This bridge-chip scheme has two notable consequences. First, it
adds to the cost. Right now APS, for example, sells a 20-gigabyte,
7,200-rpm external FireWire drive for $399.95.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a 7,200-rpm, UltraATA/66 IDE drive with twice that
capacity _ Maxtor's amazing new DiamondMax Plus 40 _ is available
at many outlets for less than $300. (I recently picked one up on
sale at CompUSA for just $249!) Granted, the IDE drive is internal,
while the FireWire one is external, which means there's also a case
and power supply to pay for, but the point remains.
</P>
<P>
   The second effect of the bridge chip is to limit throughput _
currently to about 15 megabytes per second, according to my tests
with several drives lent by VST and to what I hear from industry
contacts. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  That's more than enough speed for products like CD, CD-R and
CD-RW drives, and it's more than any hard drive could deliver until
just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's well short of what the latest hard
drives, in both IDE and SCSI flavors, are capable of. My new Maxtor
IDE drive, for example, delivers about 25 megabytes per second _ on
the same G4 where the FireWire drives top out at 15 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean FireWire drives don't have an important role
to play. Their small size and plug-and-play capabilities, combined
with good if not great performance, make them a very convenient way
to move large files from one machine to another (assuming both have
FireWire, of course).
</P>
<P>
   And for iMac DV owners, FireWire is terrific not only for
connecting to digital camcorders, but also for archiving old movie
projects to CD or a secondary hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But unless portability and pluggability are your key concerns,
IDE still delivers maximum value, in terms of price, capacity and
performance, while SCSI still reigns supreme in absolute
performance.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on storage interfaces, check out the white
paper at www.adaptec.com /technology/whitepapers/macscsiwp.html.
Adaptec, a major provider of SCSI products, obviously has a bias in
that direction, but the paper makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   You can also find lots of benchmark data in the storage sections
of two Web sites devoted to Mac performance comparisons,
AccelerateYourMac (www.accelerateyourmac.com/scsi.html) and
BareFeats (www.barefeats.com/speedtests.htmldisk).
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: Got an iBook or one of the new PowerBooks with
FireWire? If so, hurry over to
www.apple.com/hardware/articles/sleepext.html and follow the
directions about downloading and installing a new item from Apple
called the Sleep Memory Extension _ it fixes a bug that can wipe
out all the data on your hard drive when it wakes from sleep.

FIRMS AGREE TO SETTLEMENT IN TREASURY SALES
</HEADLINE>
 By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ More than a dozen securities firms, led by
Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, have agreed to pay more than
$120 million to end long-running federal investigations into
whether state and local governments nationwide were overcharged for
Treasury securities, according to people close to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   With the settlement, expected to be announced on Thursday, the
Securities and Exchange Commission, the Justice Department and the
Internal Revenue Service are wrapping up their investigations into
a practice known as ``yield burning.''
</P>
<P>
   In several lawsuits filed against investment banks, regulators
and municipal officials contended that the banks charged
artificially high prices for Treasury securities, which lowered, or
``burned down,'' the yield, or rate of interest, those securities
paid. Yield moves in the opposite direction from the price.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement will result in the dismissal of some of the
suits, including one filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan by
Michael R. Lissack, who had been an investment banker at the former
Smith Barney. It also will extinguish fears that some investors
could face tax liabilities for buying bonds that had been promoted
as tax exempt.
</P>
<P>
   The IRS had been studying whether to take away the tax-exempt
status of some bonds issued by municipalities. But lawyers involved
in the negotiations said they had been told that the IRS would not
do that.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for PaineWebber Group, a brokerage firm, said: ``We
are pleased with this industrywide settlement. It covers municipal
reinvestment transactions done throughout the industry from 1990
through 1994 and resolves any uncertainty regarding tax liability
for the affected municipal bond issuers and bondholders.''
</P>
<P>
   As part of the settlement, PaineWebber is paying about $26
million to the U.S. Treasury and to clients that issued municipal
bonds, people close to the agreement said. That amount ranks
PaineWebber second only to Salomon Smith Barney, which is paying
about $40 million, these people said.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the parties to the settlement, including Salomon Smith
Barney, the IRS and the U.S. attorney's office, would not comment
on the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The amount each firm is paying is based on the number and
pricing of underwritings they managed that regulators think
involved illegal markups. Some of the biggest firms are paying as
little as $2 million, while some smaller competitors are paying
more. Dain Rauscher, a smaller brokerage firm in Minneapolis, is
paying about $10 million, while the Prudential Securities unit of
the Prudential Insurance Co. of America is paying about $6 million,
these people said.
</P>
<P>
   As the one who blew the whistle on yield burning, Lissack, who
no longer works on Wall Street, stands to reap a reward of at least
$20 million. John Phillips, a lawyer for Lissack, said his client
intended to keep only about $4 million and give the rest to charity
and to his alma mater, Williams College.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any global resolution involving all the firms will put to rest
the issue of yield burning,'' said Phillips, a partner in Phillips
&AMP; Cohen in Washington. ``The big benefit is this lawsuit has
totally cleaned up this industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Lissack became a pariah in the municipal bond business after he
went public with his allegations that investment banks were
overcharging for the Treasuries that municipal governments used to
refinance debt. After Smith Barney fired him, he filed suit against
a group of investment banks under the federal False Claims Act.
That law provides for whistle-blowers to receive 15 percent to 25
percent of amounts recovered from defendants.
</P>
<P>
   Micah S. Green, chief operating officer of the Bond Market
Association, an industry trade group, welcomed word of an impending
settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a sense this is everyone standing up and saying, `Let's put
this issue behind us and hold investors harmless and preserve the
safety and soundness of the municipal bond market, which is so
important to state and local governments,''' Green said.

 GATEWAY, AOL SHOW WEB UNITS  &HT;     By HENRY NORR 
 &HT;     c.2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In what could be the biggest challenge yet to
Microsoft's domination of the home computing market, America Online
and PC maker Gateway unveiled a trio of sub-$500 Internet-access
devices yesterday based on the Linux operating system instead of
Windows.
</P>
<P>
   Scheduled to ship within the next year, the three devices will
deliver ``nearly all'' the features that have attracted some 23
million Windows and Mac users to AOL, including e-mail, proprietary
content, Web access, chat and instant messaging, according to a
joint announcement at the Internet World trade show in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The lineup will include:
</P>
<P>
   _ A ``countertop'' appliance intended for the kitchen or family
room. Designed to be mounted on any flat surface, it will have a
flat-panel touchscreen and come with a wireless keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   _ A larger desktop appliance, including keyboard, mouse and
conventional screen, designed to serve as a simpler, less expensive
alternative to an extra PC in households where multiple family
members want to get online simultaneously.
</P>
<P>
   _ A wireless Web pad, weighing less than three pounds, that can
be used anywhere within the home. Like a cordless phone, it will
connect to a compact base station that in turn is connected to a
phone jack.
</P>
<P>
   While the first two are expected to ship by the end of the year,
the wireless pad won't be available until early next year, the
companies said.
</P>
<P>
   The hardware, which will carry a Gateway label but will be
marketed by both companies, is intended to supplement, not replace,
desktop computers in the home, according to AOL spokeswoman Anne
Bentley. Because the devices won't have any built-in storage
capability, users won't be able to install additional software or
save files; they won't even be able to print documents.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the new products will put AOL and Gateway in a
strong position within the emerging ``information appliance''
category, but hedged their bets about how soon that market will
take off. ``These aren't going to be earthshaking products anytime
in the near future,'' said Kevin Hause, director of consumer
research at International Data Corp., ``but they do have the
potential to establish leadership in an area that will be important
eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin Reynolds, vice president of Dataquest, was more cautious
about the devices' near-term prospects. ``It's kind of neat to poke
around with one of these things while lying in bed or watching
TV,'' he said, speaking of the wireless Web pad, ``but we've yet to
see really compelling applications for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he said, ``it's good that they're trying _ if anyone has
a chance of making a strike, these are the companies who do.''
</P>
<P>
   AOL and Gateway will, however, face plenty of competition in the
appliance category. Several smaller companies, including Austin,
Texas-based Netpliance, already offer such devices.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Microsoft showed off prototypes of similar products
called ``Web companions,'' based on its Windows CE operating system
and designed for its Microsoft Network Internet service; companies
showing samples including Acer and Compaq. In January, Intel
announced plans to join the fray, and IBM followed in February.
</P>
<P>
   The new browser that will be built into the AOL-Gateway
appliances will also be available for conventional computers, under
the name Netscape 6. Free ``preview'' versions for Windows, Mac and
Linux were posted yesterday at www.netscape.com.
</P>
<P>
   AOL's own software for Windows and Macs currently includes a
customized version of Microsoft's Internet Explorer. But yesterday,
Steve Case, CEO of the giant service, said he wants to make Gecko
its default browser as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement under which AOL licenses Internet Explorer runs
out at the end of this year.

 BIG GENE STEP FOR CELERA, SOURCE SAYS  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Celera Corp. is on the verge of announcing that
it has completed a milestone in understanding the human genome,
giving it a leg up in its race against the federally funded Human
Genome Project.
</P>
<P>
   A well-placed source said Celera has finished reading the
sequence of letters that spell out the human genetic code and will
announce it any day.
</P>
<P>
   Such a move would not mean that the genome race is over. Celera
will still face the daunting task of assembling all its information
_ the genome has 3 billion letters _ into a neat arrangement of
genes and chromosomes.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the government's Human Genome Project recently
finished reading two-thirds of the genome and isn't expected to
finish until June.
</P>
<P>
   Celera President Craig Venter is scheduled to testify today
before the same House subcommittee on energy and the environment
that questioned him in June 1998, shortly after he announced the
formation of Celera.
</P>
<P>
   That hearing was called to ascertain whether Celera's private
genome hunt threatened to disrupt the public project and monopolize
the human blueprint.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Venter told House members his new company intended
to publish its human genome data and only intended to file between
150 and 300 patents on new genes it might discover.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, however, press accounts have said Celera has
filed provisional applications to patent as many as 10,000 gene
sequences. The company said the reports are misleading.
</P>
<P>
   Celera has also drawn heat for not fulfilling Venter's pledge to
publish its human genome data.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his congressional testimony, Craig promised to release his
data quarterly,'' scientist Robert Waterston told The Chronicle
recently. ``I've not seen any of his (human) data in the public
domain.''
</P>
<P>
   Waterston, who directs the Genome Sequencing Center at
Washington University in St. Louis, and is one of five top
scientists in the government Human Genome Project, is scheduled to
testify alongside Venter.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the witness list will be University of California at
Berkeley geneticist Gerry Rubin, who recently collaborated with
Celera in pulling off the biggest genome coup so far _ publication
of all the genes in the fruit fly.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential science adviser Neal Lane will be the fourth
speaker at today's hearing, which will also discuss the 37 percent
drop in biotechnology industry shares since last month, when a
White House staffer mistakenly suggested President Clinton and
British Prime Minister Tony Blair didn't want human genes to be
patented.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did his best to set the record straight and repair the
damage yesterday by clarifying his position on gene discoveries.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony Blair and I crashed the markets for a day or two and I
didn't mean to,'' Clinton told reporters, adding, ``Where public
money contributed to basic research, we ought to get it (gene
information) out there. If someone did it with private money, they
ought to get a patent on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's clarification sent Celera shares skyrocketing 55
percent and sparked smaller gains for firms like Palo Alto's Incyte
Genomics and Massachusetts' Millennium Pharmaceuticals. They
compete with Celera in the field of genomics _ the application of
genetic knowledge to drug discovery and development.
</P>
<P>
   A congressional source said that although Venter will be asked
to clarify his own testimony from June 1998, ``the hearings were
not set up to be explosive.'' Rubin, for instance, is expected to
praise Celera for publicly revealing all the genes in the fruit
fly, an organism scientists study as a simple model of human
development.
</P>
<P>
   A source at Celera said Venter will say his firm can't provide
public access to its genome data until it's finished _ mainly
because it would aid commercial competitors like Incyte, while
potentially discouraging scientific journals from publishing
Celera's findings.
</P>
<P>
   Venter is also expected to state that his firm only plans to
patent about 300 genes, far fewer than its competitors, and that it
plans instead to make money by providing software tools to analyze
and compare genes.

 APPROVAL SEALS DON'T GUARANTEE PROTECTED DATA  &HT;     By CARRIE KIRBY 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Almost everyone who uses the Internet fills out
forms, even if they don't buy anything. Name, address, e-mail
address, age, even income level _ most people part with all this
information and more without thinking twice. But federal regulators
and consumer groups are worried about what Web pages do with all
that information.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies sell or trade the details to other companies or
use it to send unsolicited sales e-mail. Others combine it with
information about an individual's Web-surfing habits and use it to
build lengthy files about the person and their spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Internet companies are trying to reassure both
users and regulators about the use of the information by forming
groups, such as Truste of Cupertino and the Better Business
Bureau's BBBOnline, whose privacy seals adorn thousands of Web
sites.
</P>
<P>
   But having a seal from one of these groups doesn't mean much,
say privacy advocates. Truste, BBBOnline and the new
Personalization Consortium, which said yesterday that it would
offer its own privacy seal of approval, don't tell their member
sites not to collect information about users. Each simply requires
the sites to list their policies, which could include selling names
and e-mail addresses.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Truste) only requires that Web sites disclose their
practices, no matter how invasive or objectionable they are,'' said
Jason Catlett, founder of privacy consulting and advocacy firm
Junkbusters in Greenbrook, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   Truste members don't even have to agree not to link actual
names, addresses and phone numbers to anonymous Web users _ a
practice so controversial that it caused public outrage when Web-ad
giant DoubleClick considered it earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   The outrage caught the attention of the government, which was
already moving toward regulating Internet privacy. The Federal
Trade Commission is investigating the privacy practices of
DoubleClick, and several bills dictating Internet users' privacy
rights have been drafted in Congress. Members of the U.S. House of
Representatives have proposed forming a 17-member commission to
consider Internet privacy issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's already too late (for Internet companies to set
privacy rules),'' said Christopher Kelly, an associate researcher
with Forrester Research. ``It's been about three years now that the
government has been looking into this, and it's been about three
years that the industry's been dragging its feet.''
</P>
<P>
   The Personalization Consortium is composed of 26 companies _
including DoubleClick _ that are involved in collecting data about
Net users.
</P>
<P>
   DoubleClick _ the ad agency that puts banner ads atop most Web
sites _ gathers information such as where Web users shop and browse
in order to show those users ads that are targeted to individual
tastes.
</P>
<P>
   For example, someone who has bought dog toys at Pets.com in the
past might start seeing ads for Dog Chow pop up as they surf, while
someone who spends time at ESPN.com might start seeing ads for
soccer shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Other members of the Personalization Consortium, such as
eCustomers.com, provide technology to Web sites that want to
provide personalized content to users.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 90 days, the consortium's founding members will
draft guidelines that all members will have to adopt. But the
group's co-chairman, Larry Poneman of PricewaterhouseCoopers, did
not say that the new group's standards would be any tougher than
those of Truste and BBBOnline.
</P>
<P>
   To become a member of Truste, all a Web site operator has to do
is post a privacy policy telling users two things:
</P>
<P>
   1) What data is being collected and what is going to be done
with it.
</P>
<P>
   2) How users can ``opt out,'' or prevent personally identifiable
information about them from being used or shared by a Web site.
</P>
<P>
   BBBOnline has similar standards.
</P>
<P>
   Truste members also aren't required to mention the practices of
their advertising partners, such as DoubleClick, which do much of
the information collecting on the Internet. Although the Web site
you're using might have promised not to sell your name and address,
clicking on an ad puts you in the hands of an advertising company,
which might not be as scrupulous about your privacy.
</P>
<P>
   Truste has formed a committee to create guidelines for what Web
sites must disclose about their advertising partners.
</P>
<P>
   Privacy advocates complain that none of the groups enforce their
standards. Seal-of-approval programs aren't monitors that patrol
the Web relentlessly, searching for violations. They make their
membership decisions mostly based on questionnaires filled out by
the Web sites themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Web site gets the seal, the programs depend largely on
customer complaints to point out violations.
</P>
<P>
   Neither BBBOnline, Truste or even Secure Assure, a less
well-known and slightly stricter program, have ever revoked a seal
from a member because of privacy violations. BBBOnline had to kick
out one Web site, but that was because the site failed to pay its
membership fee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do as much as we can ourselves, but obviously that's very
difficult for any of these privacy seal programs,'' said Phil
Lockwood, CEO of Secure Assure, which employs four people to
oversee member compliance. ``We rely heavily on consumer input,''
Lockwood said. Truste in particular has come under intense
criticism because sites that have been caught violating users'
privacy continue to bear the Truste seal. In one case last
November, Truste member RealNetworks was found to be monitoring the
music listening choices of users of its RealJukebox software. But
Truste did not revoke RealNetworks' membership, saying that its
agreement covers only Web sites, not software downloaded from
sites.
</P>
<P>
   Truste is also working toward a standard that would include such
cases, said Bob Lewin, Truste's executive director.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; The Consortium's Poneman, who created PricewaterhouseCoopers'
privacy practice, said the group's seal will be more meaningful
than Truste and BBBOnline because members will be periodically
audited by an outside company to prove that they are complying with
their own privacy policies.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Staff at Truste and BBBOnline do look at applicants' Web
sites, and occasionally even test sites' compliance by posing as
consumers. But Truste has 20 staff members to keep an eye on its
2,000 members. BBBOnline has three full-time staffers watching its
238 members.
</P>
<P>
   Truste said it calls in an independent audit on members only if
a user complains, while BBBOnline has Underwriters Laboratories
Inc. perform random audits to see if member sites are living up to
its standards.

 REPORT ON GENETICALLY ALTERED FOODS BLASTED AS PRO-INDUSTRY  By TOM &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A scientific panel that waded into the debate
over genetically engineered foods yesterday drew fire from
environmental opponents for taking a narrow, pro-industry view of
the possible human and environmental risks posed by gene-splicing
technology.
</P>
<P>
   In a 261-page report issued Wednesday, a 12-person National
Research Council panel said it ``was not aware of any evidence
suggesting foods on the market today are unsafe to eat as a result
of genetic modification.''
</P>
<P>
   Genetic engineering involves the transfer in a laboratory of
genes from one plant or animal into a crop. Traditional plant
breeding tries to introduce new genes through pollen transfer, or
sexual reproduction, from one plant to another.
</P>
<P>
   The panelists, who spent a year hammering out a consensus
report, said the Environmental Protection Agency should revise, and
then implement, a genetic plant review process which it proposed in
1994 but hasn't completed.
</P>
<P>
   The suggested revision involves EPA's proposed exemption of
plant breeders who use sexual reproduction to introduce alien genes
into a crop. The panel questioned why the review process focused
solely on gene-splicing.
</P>
<P>
   The panel also said EPA needed to work more closely with the
U.S. Department of Agriculture and U.S. Food and Drug
Administration, two other agencies involved in the review processs,
to improve safety testing and alleviate concerns that genetically
modified foods might pose health or environmental risks.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists acknowledged that their report focused only gene
modifications that make plants resistant to pests and diseases. It
did not study other common types of alterations, such as adding
genes to make plants herbicide-resistant or improve their vitamin
content.
</P>
<P>
   Nor did the report discuss whether genetically modified foods
should be labeled, a move opponents have demanded to alert people
who may be afraid of allergic reactions to new genes or who simply
don't like the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the report was issued, environmentalists complained
that the committee was stacked to favor agribusiness. The
committee's original staff director, for instance, is now a
lobbyist for the Biotechnology Industry Organization in Washington,
D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the conflicts of this study, this is not credible as an
independent scientific report,'' said Joseph Mendelson, legal
director of the Center for Food Safety in Washington, D.C. His
group has filed federal lawsuits challenging the FDA and other
regulatory agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Oh) and Rep. Jack Metcalf (R-Wa), who
have coauthored bills to force the labeling of genetically modified
foods, also accused the panel of pro-industry ``bias.''
</P>
<P>
   At the press conference where the report was released, panel
chairman Perry Adkisson, an entomologist and chancellor emeritus at
Texas A&AMP;M University, stressed that the report reflected a
consensus view that included the opinions of Rebecca Goldburg, a
scientist with Environmental Defense in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the extraordinarily strong feelings on all sides ...
it's not surprising that our work has come under such strong
scrutiny,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But while Goldburg acknowledged that ``the committee members
worked hard to get out a consensus recommendation,'' she declined
to give the report a ringing endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should look at the criticisms and look at the report
and draw their own conclusions,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The report is available at www.nas.edu.

 MAC Q&AMP;A COLUMN: MAC MODEMS CAN PERFORM BETTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By HENRY NORR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; C. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: &LR;   &LR; I recently purchased a blueberry iMac with Mac OS 9. My
problem is that I can never get above 26 to 28 kilobits  &LR; cq  &LR; per
second on the ``56K'' internal modem. Previously, when I used a
Performa 6115 with a 56K external modem (US Robotics Sportster), I
always got between 48K and 52K, so I figure it can't be the
telephone lines ... or could it? What can I do to get the modem up
to speed?
</P>
<P>
   A: If it's any consolation, you're not alone. Many buyers of
recent iMacs report similar problems, as do some users with iBooks,
PowerBooks and even Power Mac G4s.
</P>
<P>
   Two indispensable Mac Web sites, MacInTouch and MacFixIt
(www.macintouch.com/modemproblems.htmlimac and
www.macfixit.com/ultimate/Forum7 /HTML/000662.html), have collected
scores of reports on the subject. It's also been discussed
regularly on Apple's Tech Exchange support bulletin board
(discuss.info.apple.com/boards /imac.nsf/by+Topic?Openview).
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, all this discussion hasn't produced any easy
answers. Apple's responses so far, in the Tech Exchange forum and
in tech notes at til.info.apple.com /techinfo.nsf/artnum/n24482 and
til.info.apple.com/techinfo.nsf /artnum/n43079, cite myriad factors
that can affect the speed of dial-up connections, but they don't
confront the heart of the matter.
</P>
<P>
   As in your case, most users posting the complaints say they've
seen much better performance over the same phone lines, usually to
the same Internet service provider, with older Macs _ even earlier
iMacs _ and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, the problem is clearly with Apple's recent
modems, even though the company has so far refused to accept
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   At least according to some Apple technicians, the root cause is
that the modem chips Apple's been using recently implement V.90,
the international standard for 56-Kbps modem connections, in a way
that's not fully compatible with chips from other manufacturers in
V.90 modems used by many Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   What then to do? Some technical users have improved things by
tweaking the scripts that control modem settings. Other folks
report good luck with alternative scripts that have been posted at
several Web sites, particularly those developed by Ross Barkman
(www.taniwha.cwc.net/).
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, none of this should be necessary, especially
considering that Apple markets its machines as the ``fastest,
easiest way to the Internet.'' To my mind, the company owes it to
you and other customers to acknowledge the problem and fix it _
ideally with a software fix, but if necessary with a free hardware
upgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Look for Discounts
</P>
<P>
   Q: Last month, you complained that Apple charges $99 for System
7.6. Why didn't you point out that you can get it for much less
than that at several discount dealers, including Sun Remarketing?
</P>
<P>
   A: Good point. Sun Remarketing of Logan, Utah, has been selling
old Apple hardware and software since Apple II days, and it has
System 7.6/7.6.1 on CD-ROM for $39. Call (800) 821-3221 or surf
over to www.sunrem.com, scroll down to the ``Software'' heading on
the left side of the page, click on the ``System'' link, then
scroll again until you get to System 7.6 _ or almost any other
version of the Mac OS you might be interested in. (In case you're
wondering, Sun Remarketing has no connection to Sun Microsystems,
the server and workstation manufacturer.)
</P>
<P>
   Other readers noted, correctly, that local Apple dealers often
have copies of old system-software releases and might sell one at a
reasonable price.
</P>
<P>
   &LR;   &LR;  USB, FireWire
</P>
<P>
   Q: A couple of months ago, you compared IDE and SCSI hard
drives. But what about USB and FireWire, the new interfaces Apple
is pushing? I'm starting to see a lot of drives for both of those
technologies. How do they compare with IDE and SCSI?
</P>
<P>
   A: Both USB and FireWire have one huge advantage over either IDE
and SCSI: They offer true plug-and-play convenience. You usually
have to install some software first, but once you've done that, you
can plug in an external USB or FireWire drive anytime, without
having to power down your system and without worrying about
``master'' and ``slave'' jumper settings (IDE) or ID numbers and
termination settings (SCSI).
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that common virtue, USB and FireWire have very different
attributes. The problem with using USB for connecting drives is
that it wasn't designed for that purpose; it was created as an
interface for devices such as keyboards, printers and floppy
drives, which transfer data slowly anyway.
</P>
<P>
   With the current form of USB (Version 1.1), throughput is
limited to 12 megabits, or 1.5 megabytes, of data per second, and
that's only in theory; the reality, for any Mac USB device I've
seen, is well under 1 megabyte per second.
</P>
<P>
   That's fine for floppy drives, and perhaps tolerable for Zip
drives and very slow CD-ROM drives and burners. But any hard drive
or any recent CD-ROM device can deliver data much faster than USB
can handle. Yes, such devices can be adapted to work with USB, but
at the expense of most of the speed they're capable of.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, I'd recommend USB storage devices, except
floppy drives, only to users who have no choice: specifically, to
owners of all 1998 and 1999 iMacs plus the current $999 blueberry
version.
</P>
<P>
   Because those models don't have SCSI or FireWire, and there's no
room for a second IDE drive, USB is the only way to add an extra
storage (unless, of course, you have a network with a file server).
</P>
<P>
   If you have a new iMac DV or a Power Mac G4, you have the option
of using FireWire (a.k.a. IEEE 1394) as a way to hook up external
drives. On the face of it, FireWire offers the best of both worlds:
the same kind of plug-and-play convenience you get with USB, plus
throughput of up to 400 megabits, or 50 megabytes, per second.
That's more than any single drive today can deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the reality is a little different. There are
actually no true, ``native'' FireWire storage devices on the market
today.
</P>
<P>
   The products marketed as FireWire or 1394 drives by VST
Technologies, LaCie, APS Tech and a growing list of others are
really IDE drives combined with ``bridge chips'' _ special
circuitry that translates between the IDE and 1394 formats. That's
true even of the 1394 products recently announced by Western
Digital, which (unlike the other FireWire drive vendors) actually
manufactures its own hard disks.
</P>
<P>
   This bridge-chip scheme has two notable consequences. First, it
adds to the cost. Right now APS, for example, sells a 20-gigabyte,
7,200-rpm external FireWire drive for $399.95.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, a 7,200-rpm, UltraATA/66 IDE drive with twice that
capacity _ Maxtor's amazing new DiamondMax Plus 40 _ is available
at many outlets for less than $300. (I recently picked one up on
sale at CompUSA for just $249!) Granted, the IDE drive is internal,
while the FireWire one is external, which means there's also a case
and power supply to pay for, but the point remains.
</P>
<P>
   The second effect of the bridge chip is to limit throughput _
currently to about 15 megabytes per second, according to my tests
with several drives lent by VST and to what I hear from industry
contacts. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  That's more than enough speed for products like CD, CD-R and
CD-RW drives, and it's more than any hard drive could deliver until
just a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, it's well short of what the latest hard
drives, in both IDE and SCSI flavors, are capable of. My new Maxtor
IDE drive, for example, delivers about 25 megabytes per second _ on
the same G4 where the FireWire drives top out at 15 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   That doesn't mean FireWire drives don't have an important role
to play. Their small size and plug-and-play capabilities, combined
with good if not great performance, make them a very convenient way
to move large files from one machine to another (assuming both have
FireWire, of course).
</P>
<P>
   And for iMac DV owners, FireWire is terrific not only for
connecting to digital camcorders, but also for archiving old movie
projects to CD or a secondary hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   But unless portability and pluggability are your key concerns,
IDE still delivers maximum value, in terms of price, capacity and
performance, while SCSI still reigns supreme in absolute
performance.
</P>
<P>
   For more information on storage interfaces, check out the white
paper at www.adaptec.com /technology/whitepapers/macscsiwp.html.
Adaptec, a major provider of SCSI products, obviously has a bias in
that direction, but the paper makes sense.
</P>
<P>
   You can also find lots of benchmark data in the storage sections
of two Web sites devoted to Mac performance comparisons,
AccelerateYourMac (www.accelerateyourmac.com/scsi.html) and
BareFeats (www.barefeats.com/speedtests.htmldisk).
</P>
<P>
   TIP OF THE WEEK: Got an iBook or one of the new PowerBooks with
FireWire? If so, hurry over to
www.apple.com/hardware/articles/sleepext.html and follow the
directions about downloading and installing a new item from Apple
called the Sleep Memory Extension _ it fixes a bug that can wipe
out all the data on your hard drive when it wakes from sleep.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ Is Gap Inc. losing it?

<P>
   The San Francisco clothing retailer said yesterday that its
same-store sales plunged 11 percent in March and that a key
executive, Chief Operating Officer John Wilson, resigned.
</P>
<P>
   Wilson, who joined the company in 1996, was credited with
instituting a program of ``operational excellence'' that helped Gap
attain record sales and profit growth in 1998. However, the company
has suffered significant setbacks in 1999 and early 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question in my opinion that (Wilson's) departure
represents a significant loss to the company,'' said Richard Baum,
director of equity research with Credit Suisse First Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Company spokesman Alan Marks said Wilson's departure and the
other management changes announced yesterday ``are not related to
the business results.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilson's exit follows last month's announcement that Banana
Republic head Jeanne Jackson had resigned to run Wal-Mart.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gap shares fell 15 percent to close at $43.38 yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Baum had forecast a 1 percent to 3 percent drop in March
same-store sales, or sales at stores open at least a year, many
multiples lower than the 11 percent posted.
</P>
<P>
   Gap blamed the large decline, in part, on the fact that Easter
fell later in April this year than in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The calendar shift hit Gap's Old Navy business and its domestic
and international Gap chains particularly hard because of their
large children's businesses, said Heidi Kunz, Gap's chief financial
officer, in a conference call.
</P>
<P>
   Banana Republic was the only chain showing positive same-store
sales. Sales at newly opened stores boosted total company sales 8
percent for the month to $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz attributed much of the drop in same-store sales to a
strategy of discounting less merchandise. Since more goods were
sold at full price, March gross margins were ``the highest they've
been in at least 10 years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Details on profits will be released with the company's
first-quarter results.
</P>
<P>
   Gap will not fill Wilson's COO slot but has restructured
existing management to fill those duties.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Pilot, an 11-year Gap veteran who had been running the
international division, was appointed president of the Gap brand.
Chief executive Mickey Drexler has been running the Gap chain since
the resignation of Robert Fisher in October. Drexler will continue
to oversee the chain's marketing and product development.
</P>
<P>
   Kunz will take on additional strategic planning duties. Anne
Gust added the title chief administrative officer to her executive
vice president position. And Chuck Crovitz, also an executive vice
president, was given the additional title of chief supply-chain
officer.

SOLOMON BARKIN, 92, ECONOMIST IN LABOR MOVEMENT AND TEACHER 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By WOLFGANG SAXON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Solomon Barkin, a retired labor economist and professor emeritus
at the University of Massachusetts who wrote prodigiously about
working people, died on March 29 at his home in Leverett, Mass. He
was 92.
</P>
<P>
   Barkin spent 25 years in the labor movement, from 1937 to 1963,
as director of research for the Textile Workers Union, now part of
the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees. For
the next five years, he was a manpower specialist and head of the
social-affairs division of the Organization for Economic
Cooperation and Development in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   He taught economics at Amherst from 1968 to 1978, when he was
given emeritus status. Then he was a visiting professor of
economics at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and
a senior Fulbright professor at Victoria University in Wellington,
New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, Barkin graduated from City College in 1928
and received an M.A. degree at Columbia University in 1929. After
stints as a City College instructor and assistant director of the
State Commission on Old Age Security in Albany, N.Y., he served on
the labor advisory board of the National Recovery Administration
and as a specialist in industrial economics in the Department of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   His published work started in 1930 with a study of old-age
security and extended into the 1980s when he sat on the editorial
boards of the Journal of Economic Issues and the French-language
edition of Relations Industrielles, where he continued until 1991.
He also helped edit periodicals like Technical Change and Manpower
Planning, Arbitration Journal and International Labor.
</P>
<P>
   His experiences were reflected in the book ``The Decline of the
Labor Movement and What Can Be Done About It'' (1961), in which he
argued that unions were getting bogged down in administering
contracts to the detriment of their role as instruments of change.
</P>
<P>
   His other books included ``Worker Militancy and its
Consequences, 1965-75'' (1975). An updated edition, subtitled ``The
Changing Climate of Western and Industrial Relations,'' appeared in
1983.
</P>
<P>
   Barkin is survived by his wife of 59 years, Elaine Rappaport
Barkin; two sons, David, of Mexico, and Dr. Roger Barkin of Denver;
a daughter, Amy Barkin of Bethesda, Md., and three grandsons.

JUDGE PUTS PENALTY PHASE OF MICROSOFT TRIAL ON `FAST TRACK' 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS last graf with judge dropping idea of having both companies
submit final settlement offer as starting point for remedy
negotiations.) 
By JOEL BRINKLEY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The judge in the Microsoft antitrust case set a
``fast-track'' schedule on Wednesday designed to conclude the
proceeding and impose a remedy roughly by the end of May.
</P>
<P>
   And with that deadline looming, the state attorneys general, the
plaintiffs who have favored the strongest remedies, are coalescing
around the view that they will not seek a breakup of the company,
several officials said today.
</P>
<P>
   The decision on timing came in a meeting on Wednesday morning
between Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson and lawyers for the
government and Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an expedited process that everyone agreed on,'' said
Joel Klein, head of the the Justice Department's antitrust
division. The Justice Department prevailed in the case when Jackson
ruled on Monday that Microsoft was a ``predatory'' monopolist that
had acted illegally to protect its market domination.
</P>
<P>
   With this fast-track schedule, the judge appeared to drop the
idea, discussed at a meeting earlier this week, of immediately
appealing his own findings of law to the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia Circuit, before he deliberates on a
remedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're now entering the remedy phase, and I am very much
desirous of having an appellate panel take a look at my work
product so far, and would prefer if we were able to conclude the
remedy phase on a fast track,'' the judge told the parties during a
meeting on Tuesday. He did not raise the idea on Wednesday,
however.
</P>
<P>
   It also remained possible that Jackson might encourage an appeal
directly to the Supreme Court once the proceedings are over _
another idea he mentioned on Tuesday. Microsoft would almost
certainly oppose that because in previous rulings some judges on
the appeals court have agreed with some of the company's positions.
For the same reasons, government officials would probably favor a
direct appeal to the Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Under the plan announced on Wednesday, the state and federal
governments must submit their remedy proposal to the judge no later
than April 28, and Microsoft is to offer its reply on May 10. A
court hearing, presumably with witnesses, would begin on May 24.
</P>
<P>
   Though Jackson clearly indicated that he would prefer to receive
a single remedy proposal from the state and federal officials _ and
the parties said they would work hard to comply _ he also told them
they could submit two if they could not agree.
</P>
<P>
   But Richard Blumenthal, the attorney general of Connecticut, who
participated in the meeting by conference call, said: ``We expect
to be working with the Justice Department in the same kind of
cooperative spirit'' that was in evidence during the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The judge also told the states that they should submit a
proposal ``preferred by a majority of the plaintiff states'' _ an
important pronouncement because it would not allow a handful of
states to hold out for their preferred remedy against the will of
the majority.
</P>
<P>
   As one official said last week in the final days of the
court-ordered settlement talks, ``All it takes is for one attorney
general to say no, and there's no settlement.'' Presumably,
Jackson's instruction would eliminate that threat in the remedy
process.
</P>
<P>
   The 19 state attorneys general hold a range of opinions on
remedies, and some of them believe that only a structural remedy,
like breaking up the company, will work, officials said. But a
growing number of influential attorneys general now hold the view
that breaking up the company is ``too radical,'' as more than one
official said on Wednesday, adding that it might not hold up on
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   And, significantly, since Jackson has ordered the states to send
him only the majority opinion, hard-liners who held out for a
stronger remedy would be likely to lose influence.
</P>
<P>
   A remedy that would simply constrain Microsoft's behavior while
keeping the company intact would be ``more palatable at the appeals
level and maybe easier to implement,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   As for ``the few cases'' of hard-line attorneys generals who say
they could not accept such a remedy, the official said they
probably could be persuaded to change their minds.
</P>
<P>
   A state official who said he was familiar with the views of the
hard-liners, said the other attorneys general would ``have to show
a really bulletproof conduct remedy proposal'' to bring them
around. Even with Jackson's new majority-rules directive, he added,
the hard-liners could ``still make a lot of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department officials say they have not made up their
minds about what remedies to recommend. And Joel Klein, who heads
the Justice Department's antitrust division, generally does not
disclose his decisions on big issues like this, even to some of his
colleagues, until sometime near the deadline, several officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, serious disagreements arose between the state and federal
officials in the settlement talks that ended on Saturday. The
federal officials offered behavioral remedies that most of the
attorneys general _ even those now talking about conduct remedies _
considered far too weak.
</P>
<P>
   Two issues most concerned them. The Justice Department proposal
would have allowed Microsoft to continue folding new products into
the operating system and declaring them to be a part of Windows.
Microsoft's management has repeatedly said that was a right they
were unwilling to give up.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials said such a compromise would allow Microsoft
to continue to use its Windows operating-system monopoly to
overpower competitors. This is the very behavior that prompted the
present suit, and Jackson, in his ruling, demonstrated clear
concern over the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Last week's federal settlement proposal also had no clear
enforcement mechanism, several officials said. Under that plan, if
a competitor determined that Microsoft was violating the terms of
the settlement, its only recourse would have been to complain to
the government, which could choose to take Microsoft back to court.
For a variety of reasons, few companies would have been likely to
complain _ particularly if the November elections produced a
Republican administration uninterested in antitrust enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of more direct and immediate enforcement ideas have
been discussed, including perhaps appointing a special court master
with enforcement authority.
</P>
<P>
   In the meeting Wednesday, Jackson also dropped an idea he had
offered on Tuesday _ that both sides give him the final offers they
made in the settlement talks as a way to start remedy discussions.
Both sides had objected to that suggestion.

 CREDIT BUREAU CUTS OFF E-LOAN'S ACCESS  &HT;     By SAM ZUCKERMAN 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A major credit reporting agency has forced
Internet lender E-Loan to stop giving consumers a peek at one of
the most jealously guarded secrets in financial services _ their
individual credit scores.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax, one of the nation's three big credit bureaus, cut off
E-Loan's access to the data Monday, six weeks after the Dublin
mortgage provider began letting its customers pull up their own
credit scores online.
</P>
<P>
   The incident marks the latest episode in the credit-reporting
industry's long-standing battle to keep sensitive credit
information out of the hands of consumers. ``They have consistently
fought federal efforts to require disclosure of credit scores,''
said Consumers Union senior attorney Gail Hillebrand.
</P>
<P>
   Credit scores are numerical ratings that calculate the
likelihood a borrower will repay a loan based on the consumer's
past financial record. Designed by Fair, Isaac, the San Rafael
financial software company, they are the most important tool
lenders use when deciding whether to offer a customer credit.
</P>
<P>
   Until E-Loan put the scores online, consumers generally could
learn their ratings only under special circumstances, such as when
they got turned down for loans. ``This was the first time consumers
had ever been granted ready access to their own credit scores,''
said E-Loan Vice President Sharon Ruwart.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan said 20,000 customers opened accounts after it made the
data available.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac and the credit bureaus protect credit scores like
the family jewels. Equifax apparently regarded E-Loan's
distribution of the data as a slap in the face.
</P>
<P>
   After failing to persuade E-Loan to stop posting credit scores,
Equifax turned on Credit InfoNet, the vendor that sells Equifax
data to E-Loan, demanding that the company stop giving credit
scores to E-Loan, said Tom Midkiff, Credit InfoNet's chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   When the Credit InfoNet didn't immediately comply, Equifax shut
off the flow of all data to the company Sunday, leaving the vendor
unable to serve any of its 700 customers for parts of two days.
Equifax restored service when Credit InfoNet agreed to stop giving
E-Loan credit scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``They strong-armed me to cut off credit scores to E-Loan,''
Midkiff complained.
</P>
<P>
   Equifax, based in Georgia, did not return calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan resumed distributing credit scores yesterday using
another credit bureau, but that service could be suspended, too.
E-Loan declined to identify the bureau, but industry sources said
it was Trans Union. Meanwhile, E-Loan contends that Fair, Isaac
pressured Equifax and was the real agent behind the data cutoff.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the San Rafael, Calif., company admits it pressed
the credit bureau to act, noting that its contracts with Equifax,
Trans Union and Experian, the third credit bureau, specifically bar
them from supplying consumers their credit scores under most
circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have consistently encouraged the credit reporting agencies
to enforce the contracts,'' said Craig Watts, Fair, Isaac's
consumer affairs manager.
</P>
<P>
   Fair, Isaac said it doesn't want consumers to see their credit
scores because it fears they will misinterpret the numbers.
``Consumers need additional information and counsel from a lender
to truly understand their credit situation,'' said Watts.
</P>
<P>
   The credit industry also worries that consumers will take
shortcuts to jack up their credit scores, just the way some
students cram for college entrance exams. That could cheapen the
value of the data.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer advocates counter that the credit industry simply
doesn't want consumers to cast a critical eye on how a number that
could seal their financial fate is determined. ``They just don't
want the scores demystified,'' said Hillebrand of Consumers Union.

THE SUITS LOOSEN UP IN AN UNEASY WAY
</HEADLINE>
 By TERRY PRISTIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Walking into the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan
for lunch, Jim Finn, a senior vice president at Chase Manhattan
Bank, suddenly learned what it means to be in the vanguard of a
trend: He was the only man there without a tie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to go boldly and confidently into the room,'' Finn said.
``I wondered if everyone was whispering, `Is that a guy with a
dot-com and a hundred-million-dollar portfolio?'''
</P>
<P>
   No, Finn is a point man in the newest assault on the business
suit that is sweeping New York's investment banks, consulting firms
and law firms, toppling a century of dress codes and pushing some
traditional tailors into uncharted waters.
</P>
<P>
   Originally a concession to summer's scorching heat, Casual
Friday has given way to Casual Every Day. Conventions are crumbling
as old-economy companies find themselves competing for scarce labor
against new-media enterprises run by people who take their fashion
cues from Silicon Valley, not Saville Row.
</P>
<P>
   From J.P. Morgan to Morgan Stanley to Chase Manhattan Bank and
the law firm of Cadwalader, Wickersham &AMP; Taft, members of the
professional and business elite in New York are being encouraged to
trade in their pinstripes for Polo wear and their wingtips for
Weejuns. Some employers are sponsoring fashion shows, seminars and
even shopping excursions.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps with good reason. Business casual, as the new standard
is called, does not come easy to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Employers have made it clear that jeans, sweatshirts and
T-shirts that are permitted on Saturdays and Sundays will not pass
muster Monday through Friday. At the Manhattan law firm of
Winthrop, Stimson, Putnam &AMP; Roberts, the chairman, John F.
Pritchard, said the dress policy could be summed up in a simple
rule: ``If you have to ask if the clothing is appropriate, chances
are, it's not.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that while many professionals have closets stocked with
pleated chinos, Shetland sweaters and blazers that conform to the
new standards, others do not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some guys only have two kinds of clothes _ suits and slob
clothes,'' said Ann Shipley, a partner at the law firm Battle
Fowler. ``I've seen guys come in here on casual Fridays, and they
look awful. They look like they've just cleaned out the garage.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, retailers that were once perceived as a source
solely of leisure wear are only too eager to guide customers
through the sartorial transition, which, by most accounts, has
placed more of a burden on men than women. Ever since they
abandoned the power suits of the 1980s, women have been accorded
more leeway in how they dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have a lot of questions,'' said Trudy F. Sullivan, the
president of J. Crew, which offered discounts to employees of
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter when that investment firm went casual
last month. ``They want to make sure that what they're going to buy
is going to be appropriate. We're happy to help.''
</P>
<P>
   Seizing on the trend, Brooks Brothers is setting up mannequins
in office conference rooms to illustrate different casual looks. On
Tuesday, the Polo Ralph Lauren on Madison Avenue staged a fashion
show, with lawyers as models, for Cadwalader, Wickersham &AMP; Taft,
which is thought to be the first large Wall Street law firm to go
all casual all the time.
</P>
<P>
   The fashion show demonstrated ``ways to distinguish yourself in
casual wear,'' said Scott Omelianuk, the executive editor of
Esquire magazine, a sponsor of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Bloomingdale's is inviting its sales clerks to seminars with
major designers so they can instruct customers on dressing casually
and looking good at the same time. ``A lot of men don't know how to
do that,'' said Kal Ruttenstein, the store's fashion director.
</P>
<P>
   As with most fashion trends, however, there is no unanimity.
</P>
<P>
   Many professionals say that dispensing with suits has made them
more comfortable and hence more productive. In a March 13
memorandum announcing the new dress policy, William B. Harrison
Jr., the chairman of Chase, New York's largest private employer,
said, ``A more casual work environment mirrors the more flexible,
informal organization that we need to become.''
</P>
<P>
   But others say they have no intention of changing. ``I'm not
going to dress casual,'' said Richard Beattie, the chairman of the
law firm Simpson Thatcher &AMP; Bartlett. ``And I don't expect I'll see
Bill Harrison dressed in chinos at a meeting, either.'' Like other
law firms, Simpson Thatcher has been slower to adopt the trend; it
will allow casual dress this summer for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Beattie shops at Paul Stuart, the Madison Avenue store that is
not making concessions to the current trend.
</P>
<P>
   ``These companies are shooting themselves in the foot by letting
down their standards,'' said Clifford Grodd, the store's president
and chief executive. ``There's no way we're going to do it _ not
while I'm calling the shots. Everyone recognizes that we stand for
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearby merchants that also cater to the carriage trade are
similarly resistant.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people in the big firms that we take care of,'' said John
O'D. Kennedy, the executive vice president of J. Press, ``they're
not dressing down.''
</P>
<P>
   Dressing down requires the type of planning that men are not
often called upon to make. Under the rules at most companies and
firms, old-economy clothes are still mandatory for meetings with
old-economy clients. When Mitchell Sonkin, a partner at Cadwalader,
was summoned at short notice to a meeting in Philadelphia, he was
relieved that he had a suit in his office to change into. ``I felt
like Clark Kent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever its virtues, business casual has complicated the lives
of men who once thought they were immune to fashion gaffes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I find the suit easier,'' concedes Chase's Finn, who is in his
late 30s and buys many of his suits in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Take heart, Finn. The tie may be gone forever, but another
change may be in the wind _ a kind of dressing up with softer
lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``The suit,'' Omelianuk of Esquire explained, ``is actually
starting to make a comeback.''

`BAD' ZIMMERMAN EMERGES AGAIN FOR RANGERS (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas _ For 12/3 innings yesterday, the Jeff
Zimmerman of the first half of last season, the virtually
unhittable Zimmerman, the Zimmerman the Rangers need this year, was
on the mound.
</P>
<P>
   But in the next inning, the Jeff Zimmerman of the mediocre
second half, the Zimmerman of the forgettable spring, the Zimmerman
the Rangers hoped had vanished was back.
</P>
<P>
   After quelling a rally in the seventh and pitching a scoreless
eighth, Zimmerman gave up four runs in the ninth as the Rangers
lost to the Chicago White Sox, 12-8, at The Ballpark in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on top of the world for that inning and two-thirds,''
said Zimmerman, credited with the loss. ``One pitch later, and I
was six feet under.''
</P>
<P>
   The one pitch was the first one he threw in the ninth. The
Rangers had scored a run in the eighth to tie the score, but Chris
Singleton swatted a fastball over the fence to break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   After the homer, Zimmerman walked Carlos Lee, gave up a two-out,
run-scoring single by Ray Durham and walked Jose Valentin. He was
replaced by Francisco Cordero, who allowed both inherited runners
to score on a double by Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   The bad things happened in his third inning of work, so fatigue
might have been a factor. But Zimmerman, who pitched 22/3 innings
four times last season, said he wasn't tired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt great,'' Zimmerman said. ``I had good stuff out there.
I just made one bad pitch, and then I lost my aggressive approach.
After that, I started to nibble at the corners. Four runs later, we
lost the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers didn't lose many ballgames when Zimmerman pitched in
the first half last season, when the rookie reliever was a
combination of Cy Young, Walter Johnson, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson
and Nolan Ryan.
</P>
<P>
   He was all but unhittable before the All-Star break, going 8-0
with a 0.86 earned-run average. He gave up a mere 18 hits in 521/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   After the All-Star break, though, he was decidedly mortal. He
was 1-3 with a 4.58 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The second-half Zimmerman showed up in spring training. He
surrendered six homers in exhibition games, the most by a Rangers
reliever.
</P>
<P>
   He did end the spring on a positive note, not allowing a run in
his last six innings, but he allowed three inherited runners to
score on Opening Day.
</P>
<P>
   The ``old'' Zimmerman entered the game with one out and runners
at second and third in the seventh inning, and struck out Greg
Norton and Durham. He followed that with the scoreless eighth.
</P>
<P>
   That, not the horrendous ninth, is what Zimmerman wants to
remember.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got some positives out of it,'' he said. ``But I've still
got some things to work on.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Martin Fried, a theater director who was for many
years a close associate of Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio, died
on March 28 at his home in Manhattan. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was an aneurysm, said Lena Tabori, his former wife.
</P>
<P>
   During his diverse career, Fried worked on Broadway, off
Broadway and in regional theater, and moved with ease from
contemporary comedies to classics. On Broadway he directed ``Daphne
in Cottage D'' (with Sandy Dennis), ``The Natural Look'' (with Gene
Hackman, Jerry Orbach and Brenda Vaccaro, who was Fried's first
wife) and Eugene O'Neill's ``Hughie'' (with Ben Gazzara).
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Manhattan, the son of Russian immigrants. When
his mother died, he was placed in an orphanage. Fried was, said
Tabori, ``a tough little kid, a scrapper and a product of the
streets.'' He was in and out of orphanages, and at various times he
was a prize fighter and a short-order cook and served in the U.S.
Navy.
</P>
<P>
   While studying acting with Strasberg, he also owned and operated
a taxicab. In 1955 when Susan Strasberg was starring in ``The Diary
of Anne Frank'' on Broadway, at her father's request Fried drove
her home in his cab after every performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``He refused pay but accepted the assignment,'' Strasberg said
in her memoir ``Bittersweet.'' ``Marty was an ex-boxer with a
dark-haired swarthy handsomeness. Although he had come up from the
streets in an upbringing as far removed from mine as anyone I knew,
I soon came to trust and confide in him.''
</P>
<P>
   As a friend and protege of Strasberg, Fried moved in with him
and his wife, Anna, and became part of their extended family. He
acted in ``The Best Man'' on Broadway but soon shifted his interest
to directing. For the Actors Studio, he was production stage
manager of ``Marathon '33'' and ``The Three Sisters.'' In 1966, he
directed ``The Coop'' off Broadway and a revival of ``The Country
Girl'' (with Jennifer Jones and Rip Torn) at City Center.
</P>
<P>
   At the Berkshire Theater Festival, he directed Murray Schisgal's
``Fragments,'' with Dustin Hoffman, Estelle Parsons and Hackman.
Parsons, who also knew him from his work at the Actors Studio, said
on Wednesday: ``He was a good and understanding director. He never
imposed himself on the material, but let the play speak for
itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Fried also staged two plays by George Tabori, Tabori's father,
at the American Place Theater: ``The Cannibals'' and ``Pinkville''
(with Michael Douglas and Raul Julia). Later he did ``The
Cannibals'' in Berlin. In recent years, he directed plays in
Germany and Austria. In 1978 Strasberg's personal taxi driver came
full circle: he directed an Off Broadway revival of ``Anne Frank''
starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Fried is survived by two daughters, Natasha Fried and Katrina
Webber, both of Manhattan; a brother, George, of Coconut Grove,
Fla., and a half-sister, Marilyn, of New York. &QL;

 &HT;    Galarraga's homer Big Cat-alyst for Braves
 &HT;    By Carroll Rogers
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three at-bats into his 2000 season, Andres Galarraga
had convinced Braves fans he was OK. By the three-game mark, he'd
turned his attention to curing the Braves' ills.
</P>
<P>
   His three-run homer, the second long ball of the young season,
erased a miserable night from Kevin Millwood in his debut as the
Braves third starter and eased worries over Brian Jordan's news
that he'd be out a while with a strained rib cage muscle.
</P>
<P>
   It made winners out of the Braves, 9-6 over the Rockies, and 2-1
in the series.
</P>
<P>
   It also set up Kerry Ligtenberg for a chance to prove some
things. Returning from a year out following ``Tommy John'' surgery,
Ligtenberg collected his first save since Sept. 22, 1998, with a
scoreless ninth inning and capped a stellar night from the Braves
bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Chen pitched two scoreless innings to get the win,
followed by two scoreless innings from Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved I got the first one out of the way,'' Ligtenberg
said. ``Spring training is one thing, when games don't mean
anything, but to do it with the game on the line, it was a
situation I had to go out and prove to myself I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 6-4 with one out in the sixth, Galarraga took the plate
having been hit by a pitch for the third time in three games. He
launched a 413-foot shot off Manny Aybar into the left field seats
for his second homer in 12 plate appearances since he began his
return from lymphoma. That and a couple insurance runs on a Neifi
Perez error on an Andruw Jones grounder in the eighth completed the
Braves comeback from 6-2 down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was really mad inside and I was really glad to hit a home
run,'' Galarraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Looking for some early-season solace for the loss of John
Smoltz, the Braves sent Millwood on his first trip to the mound as
the Braves third starter. It looked a lot like his last trip to the
Turner Field mound in October, when the Yankees roped him for five
runs in a two-inning night.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood left after four innings bearing six runs, matching the
most he gave up all last year in his Cy Young-contending second
full season in the majors. It was his shortest regular season
outing since his third start of last year, the final one before a
mechanical adjustment turned his season around.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood paid the price for a rare misplay by Andruw Jones in
center field. Having already surrendered a two-run homer to Todd
Helton in the first inning, he watched Tom Goodwin's fly ball coast
past Jones, who had misjudged it and tried to catch it over his
shoulder. It ticked off his glove and was ruled an inside-the-park
home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I had it,'' Jones said. ``When I looked up again, it
kept going. It just carried. ... I had it easy.''
