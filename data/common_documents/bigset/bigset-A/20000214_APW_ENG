<HEADLINE> Census: Women Head Black Households  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black households are more likely than white households to
be headed by a woman without a partner living at home, and the overall black
population tends to be younger, the Census Bureau reports.
</P>
<P>
	   Data from 1999 being released Monday show that while married couples head 47
percent of the country's 8.4 million black households, about 45 percent, or 3.8
million families, are led by lone women without partners present.
</P>
<P>
	   Of the nation's 53.1 million white households, only 13 percent are headed by
women alone.
</P>
<P>
	   The statistics are being released in conjunction with Black History Month,
which is February.
</P>
<P>
	   About 33 percent of the country's 35 million blacks are age 18 or younger,
compared with 24 percent of America's 193 million whites.
</P>
<P>
	   The statistics offer more proof that America's population will become even
more diverse in the 21st century. According to the Census Bureau, the black
population would rise to 59.2 million in 2050, a 70 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
	   Under this projection, the black share of the total population would
increase slightly, from 13 percent to 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Turning to education, 77 percent of blacks age 25 and over had at least a
high school education, while 15 percent possessed at least a bachelor's degree.
Among whites age 25 and over, 88 percent attained a high school-level degree,
and 28 percent finished college or higher.
</P>
<P>
	   Blacks still live predominantly in the South, and in metropolitan areas.
More than 55 percent of blacks live in the South, and over 86 percent of blacks
live in cities or their surrounding suburbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The new statistics can be found starting Monday at the Census Bureau's World
Wide Web site, www.census.gov.

<HEADLINE> Zagat Survey in $31M Deal  </HEADLINE>
    By BRUCE MEYERSON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Zagat Survey, no doubt popular among dealmakers who always
need places to meet and eat, is getting $31 million from major investors who
think the restaurant guidebook can be a hit on the Web and Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The investment, to be announced Monday, is many times bigger than a
promising Web business might receive in its first round of equity financing,
even in these days of easy Internet billions.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal also marks the first time founders Tim and Nina Zagat have ceded
any control to outsiders since the couple began "publishing" in 1979 with a
photocopied guide to 100 New York City restaurants, based on a survey of 175
restaurant-loving friends and acquaintances.
</P>
<P>
	   Twenty years later, thousands of restaurant-goers are surveyed each year,
generating about 35 guidebooks covering 45 cities, mostly in the United States,
where the Zagat name is almost synonymous with restaurant reviews.
</P>
<P>
	   While the Michelin guide boasts a similar dominance in Europe, Zagat stands
virtually unchallenged in this country -- exactly the type of "category killer"
that makes venture capitalists salivate.
</P>
<P>
	   "When you ask 'Who's number 2?," it takes a long time to answer. To me
that's a dominant brand," said Frank Drazka, a member of the Internet and
technology investment banking group at PaineWebber.
</P>
<P>
	   Owing to that unique prominence, several high-profile names lined up to take
part in the Zagat deal: General Atlantic Partners, an early backer of E
</P>
<P>
	   Trade Group and Priceline.com; Kleiner, Perkins, Caufield &AMP; Byers, whose
credits include Amazon.com; Nathan Myhrvold, who is Microsoft's founding chief
technology officer; and Nicholas Negroponte, director of the distinguished MIT
Media Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. A public offering of stock,
which is usually the next step after venture capitalists invest, probably
wouldn't occur until next year, said Bill Ford, a partner at General Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
	   Zagat already runs a popular Web site, but like so many other successful
companies in the real world, the publisher was forced to concede that it lacked
the financial and strategic expertise needed for a real online push.
</P>
<P>
	   The company's Web-related hires, said Tim Zagat, are now "a cut above the
people we were hiring, and also more expensive. These people get paid well."
</P>
<P>
	   But, he added, "the reason for the deal is not just money. It's the partners
you get, people who can give you expertise and contacts. All of those things are
very important."
</P>
<P>
	   Industry analysts said Zagat Survey represented a very unique Web
opportunity, not only because of its strong brand name, but because local
interests such as finding food are often a driving inspiration as people wander
the Web.
</P>
<P>
	   Patrick Winton, an industry analysts for EOffering, an investment banking
arm of ETrade, noted that among America Online members, about 70 percent like to
get their arts and entertainment information through AOL's local city guide.
"Zagat would make an attractive addition to any local content site."
</P>
<P>
	   The $31 million will be used to fund a dramatic upgrade of the Zagat.com Web
site, including the addition of online reservation capabilities and developing
wireless access to Zagat services via handheld computers and mobile phones.
</P>
<P>
	   "We felt that right now -- given the nature of what's going on in the
economy and the amount of cash sloshing around -- that if we didn't take
advantage of the opportunity, somebody else will eat our breakfast for us and do
a lot of the same things," said Tim Zagat.
</P>
<P>
	   But, even as they stressed the importance of their new partners, the Zagats
continued to display the fierce independence and pride that led them to reject
numerous buyout offers over the years. So far, there's no word on whether the
publisher's management structure might change.
</P>
<P>
	   "We are the admirals. These are minority investors," Tim Zagat said.

<HEADLINE> Report: China Arrests Archbishop  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Authorities have arrested an 80-year-old archbishop of
China's underground Roman Catholic Church who had previously spent nearly three
decades in prison, a monitoring group said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   About 150 police took Archbishop John Yang Shudao into custody around
midnight on Feb. 10 in Fuzhou, the capital of southeastern Fujian Province, the
U.S.-based Cardinal Kung Foundation said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials of China's Religious Affairs Bureau said they were not aware Yang
had been detained.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1955, Yang was arrested and sentenced to life in prison for defying an
order to denounce the pope as the supreme authority of the Roman Catholic Church
and for refusing to cooperate with the establishment of a government-controlled
church, the group said.
</P>
<P>
	   He was released in 1981, arrested again in 1988 and sentenced to three years
in jail. He has also been detained many other times, the foundation said.
</P>
<P>
	   China's officially atheist communist government insists that Chinese
citizens have full freedom of religion, but it requires Christians of all
denominations to worship in state-registered churches.
</P>
<P>
	   Millions of Chinese Roman Catholics worship secretly, recognizing the
Vatican as their religious authority rather than the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Catholics in China have reported an intensified campaign since last summer
against worship outside the state-sanctioned church, the China Patriotic
Catholic Association. They report that authorities have burned and blown up
churches and taken dozens of clerics into custody.
</P>
<P>
	   The Cardinal Kung Foundation said that at least eight Roman Catholic
bishops, scores of priests and lay members were in prison and many others were
under house arrest or severe surveillance.

	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Officials are accusing the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers of distorting the economic impact of a $1 billion river project so it
would win congressional approval. Donald Sweeney's 44-page affidavit, filed with
the U.S. Government's Office of Special Counsel in Washington, accuses the corps
of altering a $50 million study of whether expanding locks on the Mississippi

West All-Stars Defeat East 137-126

	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- In the NBA All-Star game Sunday, it was a couple
nifty dunks from Vince Carter, a little Showtime from the Lakers, a few bank
shots from Tim Duncan and plenty of crisp passes from Jason Kidd. Everybody did
what they do best, with no single player stealing the spotlight. In a way, it
was a fitting first All-Star game of the post-Jordan era: Nobody is sure who the
next superstar is, and none burst forward in this game. Behind 24 points apiece
from Duncan and Kevin Garnett, 22 from Shaquille O'Neal and 14 assists from
Kidd, the West defeated the East 137-126 Sunday in the 49th version of the
league's showcase event.

<P>
    SALINE, La. (AP) -- The body of John Garlington, the former LSU and NFL
player who worked as a wildlife agent, was found three days after he disappeared
in a reservoir while investigating reports of illegal fishing, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   The search for the former LSU star and Cleveland Browns linebacker began
Thursday night at the Mill Creek Reservoir after he failed to check in with
fellow state wildlife officials. Authorities soon found his boat, unattended and
with the engine still running.
</P>
<P>
	   Garlington's body was found Sunday night about 100 feet from shore, said
Deputy Don Smith, a spokesman for the Bienville Parish Sheriff's Office. The
body was still fully clothed and there were no apparent wounds, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are no visible signs of any foul play at this time, but we're still
investigating," Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Garlington, 53, was investigating a report of illegal gill net fishing when
he disappeared in the 640-acre lake just west of Saline in southern Bienville
Parish.
</P>
<P>
	   The body was sent to Shreveport for an autopsy, and results were expected
within the week, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
	   Garlington played at LSU from 1965-67.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Japan's Nuclear Industry Under Fire  </HEADLINE>
   By GINNY PARKER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TOKAIMURA, Japan (AP) -- Its white buildings bordered by neatly pruned pines
on one side and the deep blue Pacific Ocean on the other, the Tokai nuclear
power station is the picture of serenity.
</P>
<P>
	   Inside, officials boast the plant is also the epitome of safety. They point
to clear plastic shields that cover levers and dials in the control room to
force operators to think twice before they touch.
</P>
<P>
	   But Japan's nuclear power industry, for decades respected for supplying
affordable, inexhaustible energy to a power-guzzling country with precious
little coal and virtually no oil, is under fire.
</P>
<P>
	   Five months ago, three workers at a nearby fuel processing plant set off an
uncontrolled nuclear reaction that exposed 439 townspeople and workers to
radiation. One worker died from radiation sickness in December.
</P>
<P>
	   It was Japan's worst nuclear accident. Today, the industry is struggling to
redeem itself with an outraged public and a deeply embarrassed government.
</P>
<P>
	   Policymakers stand by their unofficial goal of building 20 new reactors by
2010, but they've been forced to admit the overall nuclear program has serious
shortcomings.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The accident uncovered problems,'' said Toshiyuki Anegawa of the
government's Nuclear Safety Division. ``We've got a lot of hurdles standing in
the way of development.''
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest one may be public distrust.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan received a harsh introduction to nuclear power with the bombs that
flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 and killed 210,000 people. Over the
years, however, most Japanese embraced its obvious benefits -- today it accounts
for 30 percent of the nation's electricity.
</P>
<P>
	   Now the industry itself is to blame for its predicament. Despite insistence
that plants are safe, Japan's nuclear reactors have been plagued by accidents
and cover-ups. In 1997, officials hid the extent of damage to a state-run
nuclear reprocessing plant in Tokaimura after a fire, which exposed 37 workers
to radiation.
</P>
<P>
	   Some nuclear power opponents see the 1997 fire and the Sept. 30 accident as
glaring evidence the industry cannot be trusted to supervise itself. Industry
officials acknowledge that cavalier safety practices contributed to September's
``criticality event'' at the JCO Co.'s nuclear fuel processing plant.
</P>
<P>
	   Three JCO workers mixing fuel ignored regulations and combined nitric acid
with 35.5 pounds of highly enriched uranium -- seven times the approved amount.
To speed the task, they mixed the ingredients by hand in buckets and beakers
instead of using the plant's mechanized tanks.
</P>
<P>
	   Officials later admitted that plant workers often ignored safety
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's shameful,'' said Tastuya Murakami, the mayor of Tokaimura. ``Japan
thought its nuclear technology was superior and assumed something like this
wouldn't happen.''
</P>
<P>
	   He says the accident left his town, whose population of 34,000 relies on the
industry as its main employer, economically and psychologically scarred.
Consumers still shy away from local produce, and villagers complain the value of
their land has fallen.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It would be difficult to separate Tokaimura from the nuclear program,''
Murakami acknowledged. ``But we have to overcome the attitude that energy equals
nuclear power.''
</P>
<P>
	   Such sentiment is increasing nationwide. Last month, a small-town mayor in
northwestern Japan was re-elected on promises to block construction of a nuclear
plant.
</P>
<P>
	   New laws require periodic inspections of nuclear processing plants and
government inspectors at all nuclear facilities. A consortium of 35 nuclear
power companies and related firms called the Nuclear Safety Network, meanwhile,
is emphasizing ``self-responsibility,'' saying workers and managers should work
harder on safety as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Nonetheless, the industry's future remains in question.
</P>
<P>
	   A centerpiece of Japan's nuclear ambitions is an experimental fast-breeder
reactor that would produce more plutonium than it would consume as fuel. But the
reactor was shut down indefinitely in 1995 after a volatile liquid sodium leak
and a subsequent cover-up by officials.
</P>
<P>
	   The industry suffered another setback last month, when plans to power
nuclear reactors with an imported mix of plutonium and uranium were postponed
after the British supplier was discovered to have falsified data about quality.
</P>
<P>
	   Here in Tokaimura, meanwhile, the JCO facility remains closed, and a
10-foot-tall wall has gone up around the building where the reaction occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For nuclear industry insiders, the future looks grim,'' said Yuko Fujita,
a Keio University physics professor and anti-nuclear activist. ``The accident is
a psychological defeat.''

<HEADLINE> Serb Refugees Hope for Return Home  </HEADLINE>
   By DANICA KIRKA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NOVI SAD, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Even after all that has happened, Rajko Matic
wants to go home.
</P>
<P>
	   The 50-year-old Serb chemical engineer fled Croatia after his children were
threatened by ethnic Croats. He tried to go to his weekend house in Bosnia, only
to find it had been blown up. He drove to Serbia, sold his two cars, bought land
and built a house -- only to lose it when NATO fighter-bombers hit it while
aiming at an oil refinery.
</P>
<P>
	   He's started over once more, but his real hopes are still pinned on going
home to Croatia. ``Why wouldn't I go back?'' he asks, comparing his life as a
refugee to ``being a dog on a leash without the owner.''
</P>
<P>
	   Matic and thousands of ethnic Serbs who fled Croatia's war are letting their
hopes rise for the first time in nearly a decade, thanks to the political
transformation in Croatia.
</P>
<P>
	   Moderate candidates cleaned up in Croatia's recent parliamentary elections.
And new President Stipe Mesic, elected a week ago, promises to ease the return
of tens of thousands who fled in the years after the country declared
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991.
</P>
<P>
	   That is a major shift from the authoritarian rule of the late President
Franjo Tudjman, who led Croatia's secession and then set up a government that
thwarted the return of Croatian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb leaders in Croatia like Milorad Pupovac can barely believe the shift.
``I'm breathing the air, and feeling that air as not something being heavy,''
Pupovac said.
</P>
<P>
	   Only 60,000 Croatian Serbs have been able to go back to their homes since
the end of the 1991 war and Croatia's 1995 offensive that swept more than
180,000 people from lands Serbs had seized during the independence war.
</P>
<P>
	   Tudjman's regime discouraged Serbs from returning by laws and programs that
hindered their resettlement, said Oliver Lacey-Hall, who works in Croatia for
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   No streamlined process was offered in settling property disputes, for
example, forcing people to enter a civil court system that has a backlog of a
million cases. Overwhelmed bureaucrats kept people waiting for months while
documents were checked and rechecked.
</P>
<P>
	   Western governments know Croatia could use financial help to pay for
reconstruction and to revive its economy, but they are watching the new
government first to see if it carries out its promises on refugees.
</P>
<P>
	   Changing discriminatory laws would be good start, Lacey-Hall said. ``Once we
have the confidence that they are working on these problems ... then there will
be some support,'' he predicted.
</P>
<P>
	   Serb leaders in Croatia say changes also should include granting Serbs
access to reconstruction loans and offering continuing guarantees for safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Pupovac said returning Serbs would find a minimum level of tolerance and a
general climate of safety.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For everything else, they'll have to fight,'' he said. ``They will be
assisted. They will be helped ... but they have to know, they are starting,
sometimes, from nothing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Back in Novi Sad, Matic and dozens of other refugees rebuilding the home he
lost are waiting. As they mixed concrete inside the white, two-story frame, the
men from the Baranja region of eastern Croatia nostalgically recalled their
farms in the fertile valley bordered by three rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Some said they were afraid to go back after they discovered they were on the
list of those wanted for war crimes. Others, like Daniel Todorovic, 18, had been
back recently and left again.
</P>
<P>
	   Todorovic said he was told flatly to leave by lifelong neighbors who told
him, ``Your land is Serbia.''
</P>
<P>
	   Todorovic has made plans to go to France to live with a relative, but said
he would go home if he could. ``I was born there. My family has lived there for
500 years.''
</P>
<P>
	   Matic nodded, but said he isn't going anywhere unless Croatia's new
government delivers on its promises about helping Serbs return.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The politicians started the war,'' he said bleakly. ``And they will end
the war.''

<HEADLINE> Mayoral Race a Nightmare for Blair  </HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN JOHNSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LONDON (AP) -- Outside the hall, scruffily dressed youths hawk copies of the
Socialist Worker, while inside, the warmup for the front-runner to become
London's first elected mayor starts with the greeting ``Comrades and friends.''
</P>
<P>
	   Ken Livingstone, Cockney populist and leftist lawmaker in the governing
Labor Party, has turned this week's vote on the party's nomination for mayor
into a political nightmare for Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
	   Having captivated much of the British middle class with safely centrist
policies, Blair finds it decidedly unappetizing to contemplate the immensely
popular man known as ``Red Ken'' holding the mayor's office.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to be tied, but I'm not going to bring down the next Labor
Party government,'' Livingstone, who trades on his appeal as a maverick standing
up to the establishment, tells the activists in the hall. ``I'll muddle through
as I've always done, striking compromises.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the best efforts of the party hierarchy to blunt his attraction,
straw polls indicate an edge for Livingstone, who got the ``Red Ken'' nickname
when he led the Greater London Council in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
	   Livingstone froze fares on public transport, entertained Irish Republican
Army sympathizers and generally attained national prominence until a
Conservative Party government shut down the council in 1986.
</P>
<P>
	   In an effort to stop Livingstone, Blair -- who dreamed up the idea of an
elected mayor in the first place -- has tried reviving memories of the bad old
days of socialist dogma and party infighting that helped keep Labor out of
office for a generation.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is a matter of whether we are going to have a serious, sensible Labor
Party,'' he declared at a meeting in support of his uncharismatic nominee,
former Health Secretary Frank Dobson.
</P>
<P>
	   The party has engineered an electoral college that gives Dobson a running
start toward the Labor nomination, letting him avoid a general vote by the
50,000 paid-up party members in London, among whom the 54-year-old Livingstone
has majority support.
</P>
<P>
	   The college is almost equally divided between lawmakers who are mostly Blair
loyalists, rank-and-file party members and trade unions.
</P>
<P>
	   If Livingstone or Dobson fails to win outright, votes for the candidate
running third, Academy Award-winning former actress Glenda Jackson, will be
allocated according to her supporters' second preference. And Jackson recently
made it known she prefers Livingstone.
</P>
<P>
	   The winner will be announced soon after the Wednesday balloting deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   The Labor nominee will face Conservative Steve Norris, a former transport
minister, and Liberal Democrat Susan Kramer in the May 4 election. It's
considered a lock that Livingstone would trounce both of them.
</P>
<P>
	   On paper, the differences between Dobson and Livingstone are not great --
mainly that Dobson favors private finance to revamp London's creaking subway
system and Livingstone wants the city to do it by borrowing.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the mayor will oversee a $5.3 billion budget and have
responsibilities that include the police, transportation, fire and emergency
services, tax-raising powers are restricted.
</P>
<P>
	   Mostly, it is the potential tone of a Mayor Livingstone that strikes fear
into Blair loyalists -- and inspires optimism in disaffected left-wing
Laborites.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope he will be Blair's socialist conscience,'' says Alan Fox, a member
of the audience at a recent Livingstone meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   Mainstream Laborites dismiss Livingstone as manipulative and self-seeking,
warning his victory could hurt the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's got his own agenda,'' says Bernie Grant, a lawmaker who represents
Hackney in London's East End. ``There's going to be a big row with the
leadership of the party, and Londoners are going to lose out by it.''

<HEADLINE> Old Valentine's Day Letter Found  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- The message contained in a Valentine's Day letter Margery
Brews sent to her fiance more than 500 years could have been written today: if
you really loved me, you'd marry me.
</P>
<P>
	   Brews' letter to John Paston, written on Feb. 14, 1477, in Norfolk, central
England, was discovered in the British Library archives last year. It will be
displayed for the first time in March.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems some things remain the same ... Men still shy away from
commitment, women still take care of the nitty-gritty of wedding arrangements,''
said Dr. Chris Fletcher, who found the letter in a 1930's collection of papers
bought from the Paston family.
</P>
<P>
	   Brews' note begins pleasantly. ``Right reverent and worshipful and my right
well-beloved valentine, I recommend me unto you full heartedly, desiring to hear
of your welfare, which I beseech Almighty God long for to preserve unto his
pleasure and your hearts desire.''
</P>
<P>
	   She explains that her mother has been pressing her father to increase her
dowry: ``And my lady my mother hath labored the matter to my father full
diligently, but she can no more get than you already know of, for which God
knoweth I am full sorry.''
</P>
<P>
	   With apologies aside, Brews resorts to old-fashioned emotional blackmail.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But if you love me, as I trust verily that you do, you will not leave me
therefore. For even if you had not half the livelihood that you have, for to do
the greatest labor that any woman alive might, I would not forsake you.''
</P>
<P>
	   It would seem Brews' message did the trick. She and Paston went on to marry
and have two sons, Fletcher said.

<HEADLINE> Candidates Discuss Minimum Wage  </HEADLINE>
   By The Associated Press
<TEXT>
<P>
	   Three days a week, The Associated Press picks an issue and asks the
presidential candidates a question about it. Today's question and the responses:
</P>
<P>
	   Minimum Wage
</P>
<P>
	   Should the $5.15 federal minimum wage go up and, if so, by how much and over
what period?
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats:
</P>
<P>
	   Bill Bradley: ``I have proposed that the minimum wage should be raised by $1
per hour over two years, to $6.15. In addition, I have said that it should be
indexed to the increase in the median wage so low-income Americans who earn the
minimum wage don't fall further behind most Americans.''
</P>
<P>
	   Al Gore: ``Yes. I have called on the Congress to raise the minimum wage by
$1 over the next two years. I believe that the legislation passed recently by
the Congress does not move quickly enough to raise the minimum wage, and I
support the president's statement that he cannot sign that legislation in its
current form.''
</P>
<P>
	   Reform:
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Buchanan: ``I would go along with that, if you would take an exact
amount and cut the taxes on the small businesses that are threatened by that
increase.'' (Source: CNBC)
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans:
</P>
<P>
	   George W. Bush: ``I support raising the minimum wage as long as states are
given flexibility not to price entry level workers out of the market. In some
areas of the country, a high minimum wage could keep people from getting jobs.''
</P>
<P>
	   Alan Keyes: No response.
</P>
<P>
	   John McCain: ``Many small enterprises operate on a thin margin, and the
imposition of additional costs could result in the closure of businesses and the
loss of jobs. This only serves to hurt the very people an increase in the
minimum wage is designed to assist. I have opposed increasing the minimum wage
because of its detrimental effects on small businesses. However, recently I
supported an amendment increasing the minimum wage because it was combined with
tax and regulatory relief to offset the negative impact of increased personnel
costs on small businesses and the economy as a whole.''
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Eds: The Republican-led Senate this month passed a $1 increase in the
minimum wage, to be phased in through March 2002, and coupled the increase with
$18 billion in breaks, largely for small business. The House has yet to act.

<HEADLINE> Lab Shows Native Plants' Potential  </HEADLINE>
    By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TIFTON, Ga. (AP) -- Plants growing in southern Georgia and northern Florida
when Spanish explorer Hernando DeSoto trekked through the area in the 16th
century are thriving outside a space-age laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   Research coordinator Amy Carter, using a plan developed by a University of
Georgia landscape architecture student, has used more than 100 species of trees,
bushes and grasses to re-create Georgia's coastal plain.
</P>
<P>
	   The plants are still small, but in a few years they will surround the
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're hoping is that eventually the landscape is going to define the
building," said University of Georgia horticulturist John Ruter, who supervised
the project. "Where else can you go and see this collection of plants?"
</P>
<P>
	   The landscaping is a research project aimed at providing new opportunities
for farmers and for the nursery industry. It is also used to teach
schoolchildren and others about native plants.
</P>
<P>
	   The plants are featured at the university's National Environmentally Sound
Production Agriculture Laboratory, or NESPAL, a research institute dedicated to
keeping farmers profitable while reducing negative environmental impacts.
</P>
<P>
	   NESPAL has become a leader in precision agriculture, a method of farming
that relies on satellites, aerial photos and yield monitoring to micromanage
fields. Precision farming allows growers to apply precise amounts of fertilizer
and pesticides to specific portions of fields, rather than apply them uniformly
over the entire field.
</P>
<P>
	   Using native plants, Carter focused on areas that make up the coastal plain,
which covers most of south Georgia. When the early settlers arrived, the area
was densely covered with longleaf pines and wiregrass, an ecosystem that depends
on periodic wildfires to sustain itself.
</P>
<P>
	   In one location, Carter made a grassy savanna with longleaf pines, gallberry
holly and muhly grass, a tufted grass with finely textured, dark green leaves
that grows 3 to 4 feet high.
</P>
<P>
	   Nearby is a beech-magnolia upland forest featuring Southern magnolias,
American beech, white oak and ash. They eventually will form a shady canopy over
dogwoods, redbud, wild olive and red buckeye.
</P>
<P>
	   To represent the pine flatwoods, which tend to be lower and remain wetter,
there are wax myrtle and Florida leucothoe planted alongside blackgum, longleaf
pine and saw palmetto. Florida leucothoe is an evergreen with arching branches.
</P>
<P>
	   On the front side of the lab, there is a sandhill community, like the sandy
areas that formed thousands of years ago on the eastern side of rivers, such as
the Flint and Satilla. For that area, Carter used scrub oaks and pines, broom
sedge, saw palmetto and wiregrass.
</P>
<P>
	   Carter also fashioned a wildlife border, with Chickasaw plums, butterfly
bushes and blackberries, to attract bees, butterflies and birds.
</P>
<P>
	   A courtyard with seats and vine-covered arbors is planned. NESPAL's plants
eventually will complement the native plants in the nearby arboretum of the
university's Coastal Plain Experiment Station.
</P>
<P>
	   In keeping with the laboratory's environmentally friendly philosophy, Carter
uses few pesticides. The mulch comes from products that otherwise would be
discarded, such as the organic material left from ginning cotton. Mulch helps to
control weeds and to retain soil moisture.
</P>
<P>
	   The walkways are covered with crushed pecan hulls, another abundant waste
product in the area.

<HEADLINE> President Works Hard on His Legacy  </HEADLINE>
   By KEVIN GALVIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote ``there are no second acts in
American lives.'' Bill Clinton doesn't believe that applies to the political
stage.
</P>
<P>
	   Heading into the twilight of his presidency, Clinton has fought off
predictions he would be politically crippled by the travails of impeachment and
is working to solidify the successes of his administration and musing aloud
about how he may be remembered.
</P>
<P>
	   He is raising millions of dollars to help Democrats gain power in November,
even as his own political star is eclipsed by the White House campaign of Vice
President Al Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton's bid for the Senate in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton seizes every opportunity to frame the debate about his
administration. He talks about second chances, comparing the current social and
political climate with bygone eras and wondering about the possibilities of the
future while offering cautionary tales of past disappointments.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Once before in my lifetime, I thought we had a chance to build the future
of our dreams,'' Clinton said recently, referring to the economic expansion of
the 1960s. ``We believed, when I graduated from high school, that we were going
to solve the civil rights crisis and the poverty problems of America through the
orderly legislative process in Congress and working with people.''
</P>
<P>
	   But in 1968, after Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy were
assassinated and American society was torn apart over the Vietnam War, that
optimism vanished.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have waited, as an American, over 30 years for my country to get another
chance to build the future of our dreams for our children,'' the president said.
``Most of us get at least one second chance in life.''
</P>
<P>
	   It should be no surprise if Clinton, who had returned repeatedly from
political setbacks to triumph, sought to turn his final months in office into
the second act of his presidency. What kind of reviews he'll garner from the
critics is another matter.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's really talking about his own second chance,'' said Columbia
University presidential historian Henry Graff. ``He's talking about himself, a
kind of renewal. He just wishes he could roll the clock back.''
</P>
<P>
	   Graff surmised that Clinton, disappointed that he hadn't accomplished more
in seven years, has begun his final year with a frenetic fund-raising schedule
and several policy events a week to make up for time lost to the investigation
into his relationship with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is going to be known as the great wasted presidency -- wasted because
we had peace and prosperity and there were so many things that could have been
put on the rails to a solution,'' Graff said. ``We were derailed.''
</P>
<P>
	   Others are harsher. ``Bill Clinton has one legacy, and it's a legacy of
shame,'' said Mike Collins, spokesman for the Republican National Committee.
``The greatest challenge of the next president will be to restore the dignity of
the office.''
</P>
<P>
	   But in addition to the credit he feels he's due for an unprecedented
economic expansion and reduced crime and unemployment, Clinton offers another
measure of success.
</P>
<P>
	   He told guests at a Democratic National Committee fund-raiser in Dallas last
week that if he were forced, like a headline writer, to sum up his
administration in a phrase, he wouldn't focus on economics or education. Neither
did he hold out as an example the fact that he remains engaged in peace talks as
negotiations drag on in the Middle East and Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Clinton said he hoped to be remembered for promoting the politics
of inclusion and eschewing tactics that pit one class of Americans against
another. He singled out President Nixon's claim of support from a ``silent
majority'' as an example of the worst kind of ``us-versus-them'' thinking.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would say I believe that everybody counts, everybody deserves a chance,
and we all do better when we try to help each other,'' Clinton said. ``And I
believe that we don't get anywhere by denying the challenges that are before us
so that we can continue the comfortable arguments that we've been making in the
past, instead of the uncomfortable but exhilarating march into the future.''
</P>
<P>
	   Graff saluted this facet of Clinton's tenure, noting that his attitude
toward minorities, homosexuals and women in politics has been more progressive
than that of previous presidents, and that he presided over prosperous times.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not one of those who thinks he's going to be at the bottom of the
list,'' Graff said. ``I think he's going to stand pretty highly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton knows that one way to shore up his standing for posterity would be
to help elect more Democrats to Congress and, especially, to secure Gore's
election as his successor.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That always counts with historians,'' Graff said.

<HEADLINE> Decatur House To Lose Split Persona  </HEADLINE>
   By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Decatur House, built a block from the White House by one
of America's earliest naval heroes, is out to banish a long-standing case of
split identity. It will take three years and $2.5 million to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
	   For decades, the 181-year-old red-brick house on the northwest corner of
Lafayette Square has offered visitors an intriguing but confusing glimpse into
two contrasting eras in Washington's social history.
</P>
<P>
	   On the first floor is the Federal-style world of its first owner, Commodore
Stephen Decatur, who built the house with prize money from captured ships of
war.
</P>
<P>
	   One flight up the commodore's spiral staircase is the gas-lighted
Victorian-era, the former entertaining space of the Beale family, a wealthy clan
with ties to the California gold rush and a romantic saga quite their own.
</P>
<P>
	   Guides will continue to tell stories about the Beales, including Marie
Beale, who gave the property to the government in 1957. But the family's
portraits, frescoed ceilings and scarlet-upholstered chairs and sofas could soon
be gone.
</P>
<P>
	   Decatur House, a property of the National Trust for Historic Preservation,
is raising the $2.5 million to make necessary repairs and return the house
closer to the time of Decatur, his wife, Susan, and their architect, Benjamin
Latrobe, who also designed St. John's Church across the square.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Marie Beale is the one who saved the house for us,'' said Bruce Whitmarsh,
curator of the Decatur House. ``We're not ready to throw out Marie Beale
altogether. She will be remembered here. ... But in the house itself, we are
choosing a much more restricted time period.''
</P>
<P>
	   That means installing modern heating and cooling systems to bring the house
up to museum standards, stop persistent leaks and restore the sweep of the
upstairs parlors to the days when both the house and the city of Washington were
new.
</P>
<P>
	   A downstairs room long thought to be Decatur's office will be restored as a
kitchen, a use dictated by recent explorations inside its walls.
</P>
<P>
	   Whitmarsh said a search is under way for another museum to display the
Beale's Victorian-age possessions. ``We would like to restore the house to our
best understanding of what it was on Jan. 16, 1819,'' the day Stephen and Susan
(Decatur) first moved in,'' he said. ``We would like to return it to the Federal
era.
</P>
<P>
	   ``What that would allow us to do is to tell the stories of the other people
who lived here, including the African-Americans'' who lived and worked at
Decatur House as slaves and free-black servants.
</P>
<P>
	   The other residents include three European envoys -- one each from France,
Russia and Britain -- and three secretaries of state, including Henry Clay, who
never became president, and Martin Van Buren, who did.
</P>
<P>
	   The list also includes John Gadsby, a hotel owner said to have made a
fortune in the slave trade, and James K. Polk's vice president, George Mifflin
Dallas. The last occupant before the government commandeered the house during
the Civil War was Sen. Judah Benjamin of Louisiana, who became secretary of
state of the Confederacy.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, everyone who lived in the house just across Jackson Place from
Lafayette Square called it ``Decatur House.'' The commodore's story was hard to
match.
</P>
<P>
	   The son of a ship captain, Decatur won his reputation for daring in the
Barbary Wars by using a ruse to enter the fortified harbor at Tripoli, Libya,
and burn the captured American frigate Philadelphia. Horatio Nelson, the British
admiral whose own feats of daring had already become legendary, called it ``the
boldest act of the age.''
</P>
<P>
	   In the War of 1812, Decatur battered and captured the British frigate
Macedonian off the Canary Islands. The prize money he was awarded may well have
paid for Decatur House. His memory became an indelible part of the history of
the house in 1820 after a fatal duel with another naval officer at Bladensburg,
Md. He died at Decatur House.
</P>
<P>
	   After the Civil War, the house was sold to Edward Edward Fitzgerald Beale, a
colorful character in his own right. As a young Navy officer in 1848, Beale rode
across the continent to deliver the nuggets and dust that confirmed the
discovery of gold in California.
</P>
<P>
	   The Beale family remained at Decatur House for two generations until Edward
Beale's daughter-in-law, Marie, transferred the property to the National Trust.
</P>
<P>
	   The second floor has remained essentially unchanged from her time.
</P>
<P>
	   Now moving day is approaching.

<HEADLINE> Bush Concerned About Democrats  </HEADLINE>
   By JANELLE CARTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- With South Carolina's Republican presidential primary
looming, Texas Gov. George W. Bush worried aloud that Democrats are mobilizing
to support Sen. John McCain in the open balloting Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   But McCain said Bush's allegation that some Democrats believe the senator
would be easier to defeat in the general election in November ``flies in the
face of the facts.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The facts are that independents are also flocking in large numbers to my
candidacy as well as Republicans,'' McCain said Sunday on CBS' ``Face the
Nation.'' ``Everybody knows that if you're going to win a general election you
have to have those independents and some Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
	   He said it was his message that was attracting non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm very proud that Libertarians or vegetarians or anybody would consider
supporting me because I have a vision of reform for America that I think is
taking hold, not only in South Carolina but all over the country,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, Bush and his surrogates claimed that Democrats were trying to skew
the results of the GOP primary, which is open to voters regardless of party
affiliation.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, state Rep. Todd Rutherford, said in a television interview in
Columbia, S.C., that his fellow Democrats should ``support the weaker candidate
in the Republican primary because he can't beat your opponent in the general
election.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The only thing I'm concerned about is that Democrats flock into the
Republican primary to decide who the Republican nominee is, and then head back
for the Democrats in the general election,'' Bush said on NBC's ``Meet the
Press.''
</P>
<P>
	   Pat Robertson, founder of the Christian Coalition and a Bush supporter,
alleged on CBS that ``people who are allied with (Vice President) Al Gore are
indeed making telephone calls to try to encourage Democrats to vote in the
Republican primary ... I think that they consider him a weaker candidate than
Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane dismissed the claims, saying Bush was
``increasingly sounding like a rattled candidate.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would suggest that he focus on earning the support of Republicans in his
own primary rather than worrying about what Democrats are doing,'' Lehane said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's concern, however, has been expressed about other states with open
primaries.
</P>
<P>
	   Voting is open to non-Republicans in several upcoming GOP contests,
including South Carolina, Michigan, Virginia, North Dakota, Missouri and
Georgia. States with closed primaries have reported a flood of inquiries from
people hoping to switch their registration to Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain defeated Bush by 18 percentage points in the New Hampshire primary by
securing a majority of GOP voters and a virtual sweep of the state's large
independent bloc.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are very concerned about any attempts by liberal Democrats to come into
our party for the purpose of creating mischief as opposed to an enduring
philosophy,'' said Bush campaign spokesman Ari Fleischer. ``We welcome all
voters who will enter the Republican primary who intend to vote Republican now
and in November.''
</P>
<P>
	   A Newsweek poll Saturday showed Bush and McCain in a dead heat in South
Carolina, and both candidates are intensifying their efforts as the primary
nears.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200,000 people that McCain's campaign has identified as having voting
histories that cross back and forth between party primaries are being inundated
with telephone calls and mailings.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush recently bought the $45,000 in air time that became available after
Steve Forbes quit the Republican contest to boost his share of ads to $2.8
million.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects in the NBC interview, Bush:

<HEADLINE> Bradley, Gore on Both Coasts  </HEADLINE>
   By SANDRA SOBIERAJ Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Vice President Al Gore is observing Black History Month
with a rush of campaigning among influential New York black activists, including
two church services, a meeting with the Rev. Al Sharpton and a speech at Medgar
Evers College.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm glad it's leap year; it's a bit longer month,'' Gore quipped Sunday at
Calvary Baptist Church in the New York City borough of Queens.
</P>
<P>
	   After attending a health care forum in upstate Rochester, N.Y., this
morning, the vice president planned to address students at the Brooklyn school
named for Evers, the slain civil rights leader.
</P>
<P>
	   On Tuesday, he gives an economic speech to students at Maryland's
historically black Morgan State University before heading south. According to
polls, Gore has a solid advantage with Southern black voters over his rival for
the Democratic presidential nomination, Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We call this week 'shoring up our firewall''' against any Bradley surge
between now and March 7, when 16 states will hold presidential primaries or
caucuses, said Gore spokesman Chris Lehane.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley, who showed off his endorsement by basketball legend Michael Jordan
at Sunday's NBA All-Star game in Oakland, Calif., was highlighting environmental
issues today in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Next Monday, Bradley and Gore meet at Harlem's Apollo Theatre to debate race
and urban concerns.
</P>
<P>
	   In advance of that debate -- one of just two the Democrats will have in
``Super Tuesday'' states -- Gore rushed to court black activists who can turn
out tens of thousands of votes.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton, who accused the vice president last week of ignoring inner cities
in his campaign, ducked out of Sunday's meeting with little to say to reporters
waiting outside the apartment building of Gore's eldest daughter, Karenna.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We've had a good meeting and that's all I'm going to say,'' said Sharpton.
Lehane said an endorsement was not discussed in the hourlong meeting, which
included campaign manager Donna Brazile.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier, at the Allen A.M.E. Church in Queens, Gore appeared surprised when
Rev. Floyd B. Flake endorsed him right after he addressed the congregation of
New York's fastest-growing church.
</P>
<P>
	   Flake, a former Democratic congressman, said: ``I don't do endorsements from
across the pulpit because I never know who's out there watching the types of
laws that govern separation of church and state, but I will say to you this
morning, and you read it well: This should be the next president of the United
States.''
</P>
<P>
	   On what was to have been a rare day off, Gore rescheduled his flight east
from California late Saturday to add to his schedule the 8:30 a.m. worship at
Calvary Baptist Church and the 11:15 a.m. service at Allen, which stretched
nearly three hours.
</P>
<P>
	   At both churches, Gore quoted Scripture and hymns and recited in rapid,
staccato cadence all the top Clinton-Gore administration appointments that went
to blacks.
</P>
<P>
	   '' ... The list goes on. We have been a successful administration not in
spite of diversity but because of diversity,'' Gore said to applause.
</P>
<P>
	   His standing among the city's influential black activists was shaken a week
ago when Bradley visited Allen A.M.E. Church and was embraced by Flake and
Sharpton. Both saluted Bradley for his outreach to minority voters and
criticized Gore's efforts.
</P>
<P>
	   In particular, Sharpton knocked Gore for not campaigning in many black
neighborhoods, and threatened to ``mobilize against'' the vice president if he
did not agree to debate Bradley in front of a black audience in the city.
</P>
<P>
	   After days of stubbornly dodging the question of whether Gore wanted to meet
Sharpton, Lehane said: ``We made it clear we're going to meet with Democrats
across New York, including representatives of important communities.''
</P>
<P>
	   The spokesman noted that Sharpton garnered between 150,000 and 160,000 votes
in the 1997 Democratic mayoral primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Sharpton has spoken of lingering ill feelings over Gore's 1988 presidential
campaign when New York Mayor Ed Koch, after endorsing Gore, engaged in a
racially charged feud with Jesse Jackson, another Democratic primary contender
that year.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Discuss One-Stop Shopping  </HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- Lawyers joining with accountants and other professionals to
offer clients one-stop shopping for legal, financial and other services is the
No. 1 topic of conversation at the American Bar Association's national
convention.
</P>
<P>
	   Many lawyers view that sea change in the practice of law as inevitable but
worry about who is going to control it. And a big initial hurdle is the
longstanding ban on attorneys forming partnerships and sharing fees with
non-lawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This may well be the most important issue confronting the profession for
several decades,'' ABA President William Paul said Sunday at the start of a
three-hour ``town meeting.'' An overflow crowd in attendance and others watching
a live Internet broadcast offered comments and questioned experts.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger of law firms with other professionals such as accountants,
psychologists and social workers is barred in most states by ethics provisions
that mirror an ABA model rule. However, the phenomenon of financial service
companies -- especially the Big Five accounting firms -- employing lawyers is
growing in many other countries.
</P>
<P>
	   When doing business in the United States, those lawyers find themselves in a
legal gray area.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We live in a consumer-driven society,'' San Francisco tax lawyer Paul Sax
said. ``Does the prohibition against fee-sharing make sense to the consumer?''
</P>
<P>
	   Washington tax lawyer Margaret Richardson added: ``There is no lawyer
exception to change.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Miami lawyer Sherwin Simmons, who chairs the ABA panel considering
whether the model ethics rule should be changed, sounded a cautionary note.
``What if we change the rules and they don't work? There's no answer to that,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Simmons and others also noted that the giant accounting firms carry far more
financial clout than even the largest law firms.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABA's House of Delegates, which makes policy for the 400,000-member
group, put off a vote on the rule change last August after many members voiced
concerns over protecting lawyers' independent judgment, confidential client
information and conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed ethics change would allow people to get legal help and
accounting or financial planning advice all in one place. Attorneys who practice
family law also could form partnerships with psychologists or social workers.
</P>
<P>
	   David Becker, general counsel of the Securities and Exchange Commission,
said his agency's primary concern was safeguarding the independence of auditors
who must provide a skeptical review of a client's financial records. The notion
of ``tainting accountants by associating with lawyers'' might not have occurred
to many ABA members, he said to rueful laughter.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the ABA eventually changes its model rule, each state would have to
follow suit before so-called multidiscipline practices would have the cloud of
illegality removed.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABA's preference for keeping lawyers in charge of any type of business
that includes giving legal advice is ``nothing more than an effort to protect
lawyers and law firms from competition,'' said Albert Foer, president of the
American Antitrust Institute.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find it sad that so many members of the legal profession are apparently
intent on denying consumers access to much-needed legal services,'' Foer said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Citing Help for Hispanics  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton, struck by Hispanic support for Texas
Gov. George W. Bush, is trying to blunt the Republican presidential
front-runner's popularity among a group that has traditionally voted Democratic.
</P>
<P>
	   For the third time in a week, Clinton today was welcoming Hispanic leaders
to the White House in what aides said was an effort to highlight his
administration's record of helping the nation's fastest-growing population
group.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president himself has noticed that the Latino community is intrigued
with the Republican Party and the Bush candidacy,'' said a senior administration
official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The League of United Latin American Citizens planned to honor Clinton today
with its lifetime achievement award.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton planned to point out achievements during his administration,
including expansion of education and health care programs benefiting Hispanics
and the lowest unemployment and poverty rates for the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The award is the first that the nonpartisan LILAC has given to a president.
But the group's executive director, Brent Wiles, said the White House ceremony
is not an explicit endorsement of Vice President Al Gore in the 2000 election.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're not saying, 'Hispanics, stay with the Democratic Party,''' Wiles
said. ``We're recognizing Clinton for his record.''
</P>
<P>
	   During its legislative meeting this week, LILAC will hear from a prominent
Hispanic in the administration, Army Secretary Louis Colder. But a frequent
Clinton critic, Republican Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, also is to
speak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good for the community to be sought after by both parties,'' Wiles
said. ``I don't think it's healthy to be identified with only one party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, Clinton paid emotional tribute to Alfred Raccoon, an emigrant
from Mexico belatedly awarded the Medal of Honor for valor during the Vietnam
War. Raccoon's emigrant status got nearly equal billing with his battlefield
heroism during the event.
</P>
<P>
	   Also last week, Hispanic members of Congress met with the president and top
aids to discuss three Hispanic nominees for federal judgeships. None has been
confirmed by the Republican-led Senate, although the GOP leadership has promised
a vote by mid-March on Richard Paz, whose nomination has languished for four
years.
</P>
<P>
	   In the last two presidential elections, Hispanics voted overwhelmingly for
Clinton -- 72 percent to 21 percent in 1996 and 61 percent to 25 percent in
1992.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton took heed of poles last month reflecting growing Hispanic
support for Republican themes, said the senior administration officious.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president said we've got to find a way to communicate to Latino
audiences that our agenda over the last seven years really has benefited the
Latino agenda, and what's at stake'' if Republicans take the White House in the
November election, the officious said.
</P>
<P>
	   A pole by the Public Policy Institute of California showed that Gov. Bush
would draw at least 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in November, nearly double
what Republican nominee Bob Dole received in 1996.

<HEADLINE> AFL-CIO Leaders Plan Vote Strategy  </HEADLINE>
    By ALICE ANN LOVE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- AFL-CIO leaders are meeting to set strategy for the
congressional elections, despite continued opposition by two major unions to the
labor federation's endorsement of Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO is committing $40 million to help Gore win the presidency and
regain control of Congress for its allies -- traditionally Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The unions plan to press congressional candidates on China's trade status, a
minimum wage increase being pushed by Democrats and proposed regulations
Republicans have tried to block that would protect workers from
repetitive-stress, or ergonomic, injuries on the job.
</P>
<P>
	   House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., is to meet with the labor
leaders Tuesday, hoping to solidify support for Democratic candidates. He would
stand to become speaker should his party take control of the House.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO plans to focus its attention on about 65 close House races and
14 Senate contests -- as usual generally backing Democratic candidates.
Political director Steve Rosenthal predicted labor may lend its support to about
25 Republican candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We actively look for more moderate Republicans, but they are harder and
harder to come by," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The AFL-CIO's executive council chose New Orleans for its annual midwinter
meeting partly to highlight the strength of labor unity in overcoming
opposition. The city was the site of a six-year battle to organize shipyard
workers that was won last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   But all is not unified on the political front.
</P>
<P>
	   The International Brotherhood of Teamsters and the United Auto Workers,
which opposed Gore's early endorsement by the federation in October, represent a
combined 2 million of the 13 million members of AFL-CIO's 68 affiliated unions.
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning for Gore by union workers is already off to a strong start in
primary states across the country, but Rosenthal said, "Really, in some ways,
we're hamstrung by not having every union on board."
</P>
<P>
	   Teamsters government affairs director Mike Mathis said Gore has gained
ground with the union's rank and file since fall polls showed that among
Teamsters, the vice president was in a dead heat with former New Jersey Sen.
Bill Bradley, a Democrat, and Texas Gov. George W. Bush, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither the Teamsters nor the UAW are expected to make presidential
endorsements this week, even though the executive council scheduled a private
meeting with Gore on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the AFL-CIO would very much like everybody to do a nice standup and
applaud and just listen to him," Mathis said. "I don't know that (Teamsters
President) Jim Hoffa is going to let them do that."
</P>
<P>
	   Adding to tensions, other labor leaders share the Teamsters' and the UAW's
biggest disagreement with Gore: the vice president's support for the Clinton
administration's push to give China permanent normal trade status with the
United States as part of the process for China to gain entry to the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive council is to meet Wednesday with Labor Secretary Alexis
Herman, who helped negotiate the trade deal with China last year that now awaits
congressional action.
</P>
<P>
	   The labor leaders say China's poor record on workers' rights and human
rights should rule out new trade privileges. They will use the issue as a litmus
test for congressional candidates this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The UAW already has begun an ad campaign in Washington, D.C., newspapers --
"You can't have free trade without freedom" -- to let lawmakers know what they
could see in their districts later this year.
</P>
<P>
	   The executive council will discuss additional tactics, including the
possibility of a mass demonstration in Washington similar to those that crippled
a WTO meeting in Seattle in December.

<HEADLINE> Trump Nixes Presidential Run  </HEADLINE>
   By RON FOURNIER AP Political Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Donald won't try to be The President.
</P>
<P>
	   Colorful and controversial New York tycoon Donald Trump has decided against
launching a long-shot bid for the White House, according to sources connected
with the Reform Party's New York affiliate, the Independence Party. In typical
fashion, the publicity-courting Trump planned to announce his decision in a
round of media interviews today.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus ends a lengthy flirtation with the notion that the billionaire real
estate developer could tap his fortune to capture the White House as a
third-party candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   After months of speculation about a possible Reform Party candidacy, Trump
decided recently that the party is too fractured to support a credible
presidential candidate, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump met over the weekend with advisers to consider a second option,
running as an Independence Party candidate, but determined that there is not
enough time to get on state ballots. Trump considered that option out of respect
for Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, who had been the Reform Party's highest
elected official before leaving the ``dysfunctional'' party last week to
reinvigorate his state's Independence Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Ventura and Trump were allies during Reform Party squabbling that culminated
last Friday with the governor's departure and the ouster of a Ventura ally as
the party's chairman.
</P>
<P>
	   A fractious Reform Party meeting Saturday in Nashville, Tenn., returned
power to allies of party founder Ross Perot, who has not ruled out running for
president a third time.
</P>
<P>
	   While he never formally entered the race, Trump made a handful of campaign
trips, hinted broadly for weeks that he would run and issued comprehensive
health care and federal debt-reduction proposals. He held a single-digit ranking
in most public polls and was not given much of a chance of winning the
presidency.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump's decision leaves former Republican Pat Buchanan as the front-running
candidate for the Reform Party nomination. Buchanan left the GOP after two
failed presidential bids, eying the nearly $13 million in federal campaign funds
that will be awarded the Reform nominee.
</P>
<P>
	   Trump estimates his personal net worth at $5 billion. Though independent
analyses offer lower estimates, there was little doubt he was wealthy enough to
make inroads toward the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Many Perot allies encouraged Buchanan to bolt the GOP and join the Reform
Party, in part because they hoped the conservative firebrand could help defy
Ventura's wing of the party. With Ventura out of the way, Perot's allies are
speculating that the Texas billionaire could seek the nomination himself.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot has neither confirmed nor denied the speculation.

<HEADLINE> Japan Insurers Drop Merger Plans  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's third-largest casualty insurer on Monday abandoned
plans to join two rivals in a merger that would have formed the country's
largest non-life insurance company.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsui Marine and Fire Insurance Co. said in a statement it decided not to
merge with the smaller Nippon Fire and Insurance Co. and Koa Fire and Insurance
Co. because such an agreement would "hinder" its traditional ties to a group of
companies centered around Sakura Bank Ltd.
</P>
<P>
	   The three companies had announced last October plans to combine their
businesses by April 2002, forming an entity that would have surpassed Tokio
Marine and Fire Insurance Co. as Japan's largest non-life insurer.
</P>
<P>
	   Local media reports said the three-way merger talks broke down because hopes
of achieving economies of scale proved weaker than the insurers' loyalties to
their respective keiretsu -- the traditional but informal alliances among
Japanese companies affiliated with the same bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Koa Fire and Nippon Fire both have ties to Sanwa Bank Ltd., a rival of
Sakura Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitsui Marine said it is now considering a merger with Sumitomo Marine and
Fire Insurance Co., Japan's No. 4 non-life insurer.
</P>
<P>
	   Sumitomo Marine and Mitsui Marine are already set to become part of the same
keiretsu when Sumitomo Bank Ltd. and Sakura Bank merge in April 2002 to form the
world's second-largest commercial lender.
</P>
<P>
	   The presidents of Koa Fire and Nippon Fire said at a news conference Monday
that they will press ahead with a two-way deal, formally merging in 2001 and
integrating their operations "as soon as possible" after that.

<HEADLINE> Jerry Lewis Makes Remarks on Women  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    ASPEN, Colo. (AP) -- Jerry Lewis stunned an audience gathered to honor his
work by saying he doesn't like female comics and views a woman as "a producing
machine" for children.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis, 73, made the remarks Saturday during a question-and-answer session at
the U.S. Comedy Arts Festival. Fellow comedian Martin Short moderated the
retrospective on Lewis' life, attended by about 1,000 people, including actor
Steve Martin.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis had spoken affectionately of actor Dean Martin and other legendary
comics before a member of the audience asked him which female comics he admires.
</P>
<P>
	   "I don't like any female comedians," Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
	   Short reminded Lewis about Lucille Ball. "You must have loved her," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis replied: "No."
</P>
<P>
	   "A woman doing comedy doesn't offend me, but sets me back a bit," Lewis
said. "I, as a viewer, have trouble with it. I think of her as a producing
machine that brings babies in the world."
</P>
<P>
	   The session ended soon afterward, and many audience members left the room at
the St. Regis Hotel, shaking their heads in disbelief.
</P>
<P>
	   A message left Sunday night for a Lewis spokesperson in Las Vegas was not
immediately returned.
</P>
<P>
	   Lewis became a show business fixture appearing in nightclubs and films with
partner Martin. The entertainers parted ways in 1956, and Lewis went on to
direct movies including "The Bellboy" and "Geisha Boy." He has appeared in more
than 50 films.
</P>
<P>
	   Later generations have come to know Lewis more for his annual hosting of the
Muscular Dystrophy Association telethon.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprise reversal, President Abdurrahman
Wahid suspended his powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet
on Monday over his alleged role in last year's bloodshed in East Timor, a
spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Upon his return home Sunday following a 16-day overseas tour, Wahid met with
Wiranto and announced that the minister would remain part of the government
while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal inquiry into the
violence that followed East Timor's vote for independence.
</P>
<P>
	   But late Sunday night, the president -- who has been known to frequently
make strong statements on issues only to ignore them later or change his stance
-- told Indonesian reporters that Wiranto would be suspended from the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Cabinet secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said the decree confirming
Wiranto's suspension pending the outcome of the new probe had already been
signed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The president made the new decision by himself last night for the sake of
the government's stability and the interests of Gen. Wiranto to allow him to
concentrate on the investigation to be conducted by the attorney general's
special team,'' Simanjuntak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Interior Minister Surjadi Sudirdja was sworn in as Wiranto's replacement.
Speaking to reporters after the handover, Wiranto thanked the president for
waiting until he returned from his 16-day overseas trip to make a decision and
``to listen to my position.''
</P>
<P>
	   He denied any wrongdoing regarding the events in East Timor, but said that
``the suspension is (Wahid's) prerogative and must be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the right of the president to make a decision about his cabinet, and
we shouldn't make an uproar about this,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto has been accused by separate Indonesian and U.N. human rights panels
of failing to prevent East Timor's violence in September as commander of the
country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people were killed and much of the province devastated in
attacks by anti-independence militants following East Timor's vote for
independence on Aug. 30. Indonesian soldiers have been accused of taking part in
some attacks and stepping back and allowing many others.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid's foreign tour was intended to encourage investment in Indonesia's
moribund economy. But that goal was largely forgotten as the media focused on
the political duel, which sparked fears of a possible military coup in Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   Military chief Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto told journalists following the
ceremony that the armed forces were loyal to Wahid and would respect his
decision.
</P>
<P>
	   U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan, who met briefly Saturday with Wahid on
the sidelines of a U.N. trade conference in Bangkok, Thailand, said he was
following ``very closely'' the discussions between Wahid and Wiranto.
</P>
<P>
	   Two weeks ago -- after Wahid left for Saudi Arabia on the first leg of his
trip -- a government-sponsored human rights probe into the crisis in East Timor
recommended Wiranto be investigated by state prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after, Wahid announced he would suspend Wiranto. But Wiranto defied
calls to step down. He denied any wrongdoing, and insisted he would present his
case to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   The general was a protege of Suharto, who ruled Indonesia for 32 years until
he was ousted in 1998. Wiranto was given the post of security minister last
October when Wahid took office.
</P>
<P>
	   As well as targeting Wiranto, Wahid also has been taking on Suharto himself.
His administration reopened a corruption probe against the 78-year-old autocrat,
and state lawyers named him as a suspect over allegations that his family got
rich on billions of dollars channeled through charitable foundations he set up
and controlled.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Suharto failed to show up at the attorney general's office where
prosecutors planned to question him. His lawyers told reporters that the former
strongman was too ill to testify.
</P>
<P>
	   In another development, Simanjuntak announced that State Secretary Ali
Rahman, who runs the president's office, had resigned from the government.
</P>
<P>
	   No explanation was given, but Rahman -- the second member of the 35-person
Cabinet to quit -- last month proposed to scale down his once-powerful ministry.

<HEADLINE> Moderate Earthquake in Philippines  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- A moderately strong earthquake struck a southern
Philippine province early today but occurred too far from land to cause any
damage, government seismologists said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology said the quake, which
it measured at magnitude 5, was centered at sea 116 miles southeast of the town
of Mati in Davao Oriental province.
</P>
<P>
	   Mati is 620 miles southeast of Manila.
</P>
<P>
	   The pre-dawn earthquake was caused by a movement in the Philippine Trench,
which runs along the eastern coast of the archipelago.
</P>
<P>
	   The Institute's Bartolome Bautista described the quake as moderately strong
but said it occurred too far from land to cause any damage or casualties.
</P>
<P>
	   The earthquake was also monitored by the Hong Kong Observatory, which
estimated its magnitude at 5.9.
</P>
<P>
	   The Philippines is in the Pacific ``Ring of Fire'' where earthquakes and
volcanic eruptions frequently occur.

<HEADLINE> Human Remains Used To Create Art  </HEADLINE>
   By SHELIA HARDWELL-BYRD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BILOXI, Miss. (AP) -- Walk through the glass doors of Commander's Gallery,
past the conventional oil and pastel paintings, and on the other side of the
green curtains you'll find a new art medium -- human ashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Bettye Jane Brokl, a statuesque woman dressed in black, smiles as she points
to the grayish powder nestled between the broad strokes of azure blue and bright
red.
</P>
<P>
	   It is here that art, death and immortality intermix. Brokl, whose home is in
a state where traditional burials are usually the rule, admits her cutting-edge
memorials that use human ashes aren't for everyone.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not for people who do not believe in cremation. It takes someone that
likes unique things and maybe is into the arts. It's done with dignity and
taste. The mourning process is not disturbed here,'' said Brokl, who has
patented her process of sealing ashes under glass.
</P>
<P>
	   It is an alternative to the urn, she said.
</P>
<P>
	   About six tablespoons of ash are sprinkled on the artwork and the abstract
painting is then placed in ornate frames.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokl, who only months ago began selling the paintings outside of
Mississippi, said she's currently relying on funeral homes to pitch the
memorials to mourners. To date, 50 of Brokl's nearly 100 memorials have been
sold.
</P>
<P>
	   It all began after Brokl's mother died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   ``She had donated her body to science, and for two years I went without
closure,'' Brokl said. ``So when I got the ashes back, I kept a cupful and
buried the rest in Kentucky. I did some abstracts and incorporated my mother's
ashes and gave it to family members.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It feels good to have her here, and I take her everywhere I go,'' said
Brokl, a former financial planner who is a self-taught artist.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokl, with a crew of about nine people, currently works in a small room in
the gallery, but plans to open a factory before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
	   One of Brokl's friends, Danny Coates, encouraged her to start marketing the
creations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was done so well and in such a dignified manner, I thought families
wouldn't have a problem with it,'' Coates said. ``However, I told her that where
she was at there was no market for this.''
</P>
<P>
	   The number of cremations in Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana are among the
lowest in the nation, said Coates, who manages two cemeteries on the Mississippi
Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   The national cremation rate is 26 percent, according to the Cremation
Association of North America. In Mississippi, the association said the 2000 rate
is projected at 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokl has had some marketing success in California, a state with a 42
percent cremation rate. She said the West Coast funeral homes keep her artwork
on the walls of their establishment to offer to family members as a keepsake.
</P>
<P>
	   Her work can also be seen on the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
	   George Foley, executive vice-president of the York Group, one of the
nation's largest casket makers, requested samples of Brokl's work after meeting
her at a funeral industry convention.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's going to be very few people ready for it, but it's going to be
something to offer people,'' said Foley, who also owns a crematorium in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
	   Foley said the way people view death has changed and the traditional burial
has become blase to some. He said the rate of cremation is increasing and so are
the different ways of preserving the ashes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Cremation is in vogue today, and in a lot of cases, it's less expensive,''
said Foley.

Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto Suspended
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprise reversal, President Abdurrahman
Wahid suspended his powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet
on Monday over his alleged role in last year's bloodshed in East Timor, a
spokesman said. Cabinet secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said the decree
confirming Wiranto's suspension pending the outcome of the new probe had been
signed. "The president made the new decision by himself last night for the sake
of the government's stability and the interests of Gen. Wiranto to allow him to
concentrate on the investigation to be conducted by the attorney general's
special team," Simanjuntak said.

	   LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Trouble-free and performing as planned, a robot craft
was on target Monday to become the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid in a
Valentine's Day rendezvous with a space rock named for the Greek god of love.
Mission officials said the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, or NEAR, spacecraft
was set to automatically fire its thrusters and settle into a 124-mile orbit of
the gray, potato-shaped rock called Eros. Thrusters were to fire automatically
this morning. Eros is so distant from Earth that it takes 14 1/2 minutes for a

West All-Stars Defeat East 137-126
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- In the NBA All-Star game Sunday, it was a couple
nifty dunks from Vince Carter, a little Showtime from the Lakers, a few bank
shots from Tim Duncan and plenty of crisp passes from Jason Kidd. Everybody did
what they do best, with no single player stealing the spotlight. In a way, it
was a fitting first All-Star game of the post-Jordan era: Nobody is sure who the
next superstar is, and none burst forward in this game. Behind 24 points apiece
from Duncan and Kevin Garnett, 22 from Shaquille O'Neal and 14 assists from
Kidd, the West defeated the East 137-126 Sunday in the 49th version of the
league's showcase event.

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Tokyo stocks closed lower Monday following a retreat by U.S.
share prices. The dollar was lower against the yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 153.56 points, or 0.78
percent, to close at 19,556.46. On Thursday, the Nikkei dropped 1.49 percent to
19,710.02.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar was trading at 108.20 yen on the Tokyo foreign exchange market,
down 0.32 yen Thursday and below its level of 108.99 yen in late New York
trading Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   Japanese financial markets were closed Friday for a national holiday.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, shares in high-tech companies retreated slightly as
investors reacted to falls late last week on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   In New York trading Friday, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 218.42
points, or 2 percent, to 10,425.21 while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite Index
fell 90.18 points to 4,395.45.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, shares in retailers slipped on news that supermarket chain
operator Nagasakiya Co. filed for reorganization Sunday with a group debt of
$3.96 billion.
</P>

	   On the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 735 issues declined
compared with 481 that rose. A total of 137 issues were unchanged from Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Media Execs Debate Quality in D.C.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Veteran Washington Post reporter David Broder worries
that today's Internet-driven push to deliver news and information quickly brings
with it a sacrifice in quality.
</P>
<P>
	   Broder said many errors that have resulted in a loss of public confidence
can be attributed to the absence of a good and thorough editing. Stories at the
Post, he said, often are posted on its Web site unedited, and television runs
into similar problems.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think the fast part of it is the really damaging thing to ... our
credibility," Broder told a National Press Club audience on Saturday at a media
ethics panel he shared with 11 other journalists and media experts.
</P>
<P>
	   "I have been on the set ... when some 12-year-old rushes a piece of copy (to
the anchor people), they read it, and at the next commercial break, having some
sense of judgment and perspective, one or the other will say, 'Where the hell
did that come from?"' Broder said. "But by now its out there in the ether."
</P>
<P>
	   The annual National Roundtable was sponsored by the Scripps Howard
Foundation. It was carried live by C-SPAN and moderated by C-SPAN founder Brian
Lamb.
</P>
<P>
	   Associated Press President and CEO Louis D. Boccardi said the sort of
instantaneous reporting Broder spoke about cannot be reversed, but the media
still are "obliged to bring the same standards" as before.
</P>
<P>
	   Boccardi noted that the voluminous Starr Report of Independent Counsel
Kenneth Starr's 1998 investigation of President Clinton reached AP members
through The Wire, the agency's multimedia World Wide Web site, in six seconds.
The Watergate Report, with technology available two decades ago, would have
required 33 hours.
</P>
<P>
	   Boccardi said journalists cannot be swept up by the speed but must rely on
the same traditional editing processes that have protected against errors in the
past.

<HEADLINE> Globalization Dangers Unresolved  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID THURBER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The world's economies are becoming interdependent
with astonishing speed, but both supporters and opponents of the trend warned
today that danger lurks in a deepening divide between the haves and have-nots.
</P>
<P>
	   One view of globalization sees it as a unique and historic opportunity for
mankind, but others view it as a force that destroys societies and promotes
inequality among nations, said Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
	   "There is a serious asymmetry in the relationship between the developing and
developed that has to be sorted out," Iglesias told delegates at the U.N.
Conference on Trade and Development.
</P>
<P>
	   The UNCTAD meeting has been widely touted as a chance to redress the balance
in favor of poorer countries in the wake of bitter disagreements that wrecked
the World Trade Organization meeting in Seattle late last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The Seattle meeting broke up with no agreement on launching a broad round of
trade liberalization negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   Developing countries claimed the pursuit of freer trade was moving too
quickly and they were being left behind. They also claimed they had been left
out of discussions vital to their interests.
</P>
<P>
	   "The big losers in Seattle were clearly the developing countries," Iglesias
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael Bailey, senior policy adviser for the charity Oxfam, said free trade
could help the poorer nations, but only if everyone played fairly.
</P>
<P>
	   "Currently, we think the developed countries are being extremely
hypocritical," Bailey said today in an interview with The Associated Press.
"They are committed preachers of liberalization for everybody else, but when it
comes to the domestic markets a whole new series of arguments appear for why
they shouldn't open up."
</P>
<P>
	   Developed countries are still balking at a proposal by WTO Director-General
Mike Moore that they should remove all trade barriers for products from the
world's 48 poorest countries.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the wealthy nations are prepared to give ground, the United States
and Japan, among others, are concerned about the damage to their own producers
if they open their markets entirely to products such as rice and textiles.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey said Moore's proposal was the most important thing that could come
out of the Bangkok meeting, which runs until Saturday.
</P>
<P>
	   He added that Oxfam was not opposed to freer trade in principle.
</P>
<P>
	   "Liberalization can produce benefits, but it has to be very carefully placed
in sequence, and there are (economic) sectors that will need protection or
support for the foreseeable future," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   UNCTAD on Sunday issued a report saying that the number of countries falling
into its definition of least developed -- the world's poorest nations -- had
risen from 25 to 48 since 1971. Only the African nation of Botswana had managed
to graduate from the list.
</P>
<P>
	   The least developed countries are "becoming increasingly marginalized in the
world economy," said UNCTAD Deputy Secretary-General Carlos Fortin.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no greater challenge facing the international community today than
integrating the less-developed countries into the world economy and trading
system," Fortin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Small numbers of anti-free trade protesters today continued to gather close
to the convention center where the UNCTAD meeting is being held -- but police
kept them from getting too close to the dignitaries from 190 nations.
</P>
<P>
	   There have been no riots like the ones that disrupted the Seattle meeting,
but protesters did break through a police cordon on Sunday to hold a
demonstration in front of the center.
</P>
<P>
	   A protester also threw a pie into the face of outgoing International
Monetary Fund head Michel Camdessus before his keynote speech Sunday.

<HEADLINE> 'Scream 3' Mutes DiCaprio's 'Beach'  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Horror spoke louder than romance at the box office over
the Valentine's Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
	   The slash-'em-up sequel "Scream 3" took in $16.4 million in its second
weekend to hang onto the top spot at the box office, outdoing "The Beach,"
romantic hero Leonardo DiCaprio's new movie, according to industry estimates
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beach," about an American backpacker's ill-fated search for paradise in
Thailand, debuted in second place with $15 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Two kid flicks also opened in the top five. "Snow Day," a comedy about
children wreaking havoc when a blizzard closes their school, grossed $14.8
million for third place. The movie co-stars Chevy Chase, Jean Smart, Chris
Elliott and Pam Grier.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Tigger Movie," Disney's animated Winnie the Pooh tale, was No. 4 with
$9.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Last weekend's No. 2 film, the Oscar contender "The Hurricane," dropped to
fifth place with $3.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Ticket sales for "Scream 3" dropped 53 percent from its $34.7 million
opening last weekend, although it held up better than "Scream 2," which declined
65 percent its second weekend. "Scream 3" has grossed $57 million in 10 days.
</P>
<P>
	   Panned by many critics, "The Beach" puts DiCaprio in a far darker role than
the heroic heartthrob he played in "Titanic," the all-time box-office leader.
</P>
<P>
	   Distributor 20th Century Fox was not disappointed by the film's No. 2 slot.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're all so wound up with what's No. 1 and 2," said Tom Sherak, the
studio's head of distribution. "The fact is there's a lot of movies that have
done really well that didn't open as No. 1," such as "There's Something About
Mary."
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beach's" R rating cut off some of DiCaprio's biggest fans, girls under
17 who would have to see the movie with a parent or guardian. Even so, women
made up 57 percent of the movie's audience, and more than half of them were
under 25.
</P>
<P>
	   "There were a lot of guys that went to the movie, and there was enough
adventure in it for them. But anytime you have a male star that females are
really interested in, they're generally dragging the guys to see it," Sherak
said.
</P>
<P>
	   DiCaprio's "The Man in the Iron Mask" also opened in second place in March
1998. It was beaten by "Titanic," which had topped the box office for three
months.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Beach" did score the highest per-theater average. Playing at 2,546
sites, the movie averaged $5,892, compared to $4,730 in 3,467 theaters for
"Scream 3."
</P>
<P>
	   After two months that were heavy on adult-oriented films vying for Oscar
consideration, the weekend offered a truly diverse lineup.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the first weekend in a long time that spoke to every demographic,"
said Paul Dergarabedian, president of Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. "A horror
movie with 'Scream 3,' a date movie with DiCaprio, a movie for the family and
older kids with 'Snow Day,' and 'Tigger' for families with little kids."
</P>
<P>
	   Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at North American theaters,
according to Exhibitor Relations Co. Inc. Final figures were to be released
today.
</P>
<P>
	   1. "Scream 3," $16.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   2. "The Beach," $15 million.
</P>
<P>
	   3. "Snow Day," $14.8 million.

<HEADLINE> Nationalists Might Lose in Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By WILLIAM FOREMAN Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Many Taiwanese believe their island is weeks away
from a historic event: the Nationalist Party's loss of the presidency for the
first time in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the party might retain power even if its candidate -- who has been
lagging in the polls the entire campaign -- loses the tight three-way race next
month to popular independent James Soong.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Nationalists recently expelled Soong and have spent millions on
vicious attack ads painting him as a power-hungry politician who embezzled party
funds, they could chose to make up with him if he moves into the presidential
mansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a flip-flop wouldn't be unexpected from the Nationalists, who have a
reputation for being willing to do nearly anything to stay in power. Embracing
Soong might also prove preferable to enduring the humiliation of being forced
into the opposition for the first time in five decades.
</P>
<P>
	   And Soong himself might welcome an invitation to return to the fold. Until
recently, he was one of the party's superstars. He claims to still have a strong
following within the party, which he says has been hijacked by a small clique
that doesn't represent the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Soong, Chin Jin-sheng, won't rule out the possibility of the
candidate becoming a Nationalist again. But Chin said the campaign hasn't
thought much about it and is only focusing on winning the election.
</P>
<P>
	   If Soong becomes president, he would likely find it hard to resist the
allure of the party's vast resources and legislative majority. Governing
Taiwan's young democracy -- the island's first direct presidential election was
in 1996 -- could be difficult for an independent lacking the brain trust and
funding offered by the Nationalists, one of the world's richest parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The party ousted Soong in November because he challenged the official
Nationalist candidate, Vice President Lien Chan -- a stiff ex-political science
professor from a wealthy family who has struggled to inspire ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Soong has created an image just the opposite. As a former Taiwan provincial
governor -- a job that was eliminated in a government downsizing drive -- he
built a reputation as a can-do leader who constantly toured remote towns
forgotten by other politicians, listened to the people and delivered on his
promises.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Nationalists welcomed Soong back into their ranks, it would be a
cruel stab in the heart of the retiring 77-year-old President Lee Teng-hui,
Soong's former mentor and now his most fierce critic. Lee has said he could
tolerate anyone but Soong as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Although several polls show Soong leading, there's still plenty of time left
to lose the election. Many believe the Nationalists will use their vast campaign
war chest and local political connections to buy votes, especially in rural
areas where the practice is common.
</P>
<P>
	   Soong has also been dogged by allegations he transferred large sums of party
funds into his family accounts -- accusations he has repeatedly denied. The
party could be waiting until the final weeks of the campaign to unleash other
accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   Another threat is Chen Shui-bian, running for the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party. Some polls say the former Taipei mayor is in first place, and
he could benefit from Soong splitting the Nationalist vote.

Globalization Dangers Unresolved
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- The world's economies are becoming interdependent
with astonishing speed, but both supporters and opponents of the trend warned
Monday that danger lurks in a deepening divide between the haves and have-nots.
One view of globalization sees it as a unique and historic opportunity for
mankind, but others view it as a force that destroys societies and promotes
inequality among nations, said Enrique Iglesias, president of the Inter-American
Development Bank. "There is a serious asymmetry in the relationship between the
developing and developed that has to be sorted out," Iglesias told delegates at
the U.N. Conference on Trade and Development.

Report: China Arrests Archbishop

<P>
	   BEIJING (AP) -- Authorities have arrested an 80-year-old archbishop of
China's underground Roman Catholic Church who had previously spent nearly three
decades in prison, a monitoring group said Monday. About 150 police took
Archbishop John Yang Shudao into custody around midnight on Feb. 10 in Fuzhou,
the capital of southeastern Fujian Province, the U.S.-based Cardinal Kung
Foundation said in a statement. Officials of China's Religious Affairs Bureau
said they were not aware Yang had been detained.

Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto Suspended

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a surprise reversal, President Abdurrahman
Wahid suspended his powerful security minister, Gen. Wiranto, from the Cabinet
on Monday over his alleged role in last year's bloodshed in East Timor, a
spokesman said. Cabinet secretary Marsilam Simanjuntak said the decree
confirming Wiranto's suspension pending the outcome of the new probe had been
signed. "The president made the new decision by himself last night for the sake
of the government's stability and the interests of Gen. Wiranto to allow him to
concentrate on the investigation to be conducted by the attorney general's

Spacecraft Approaching Asteroid
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   LAUREL, Md. (AP) -- Trouble-free and performing as planned, a robot craft
was on target Monday to become the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid in a
Valentine's Day rendezvous with a space rock named for the Greek god of love.
Mission officials said the Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous, or NEAR, spacecraft
was set to automatically fire its thrusters and settle into a 124-mile orbit of
the gray, potato-shaped rock called Eros. Thrusters were to fire automatically
this morning. Eros is so distant from Earth that it takes 14 1/2 minutes for a
radio signal confirming the rocket firing to reach NEAR mission control.

	   SAN JOSE, Calif. (AP) -- Microsoft Corp. may be gearing up for the launch of
its Windows 2000 operating system, but the message for the average consumer is
"Don't try this at home." Windows 2000, a family of products that succeeds
Windows NT version 4.0, is aimed at corporate users who need the upgrade for the

-- is no substitute for the Windows Millennium Edition, which is targeted for
home machines.

Census Reports on Black Households
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black households are more likely than white households to
be headed by a woman without a partner living at home, and the overall black
population tends to be younger, the Census Bureau reports. Data from 1999 being
released Monday show that while married couples head 47 percent of the country's
8.4 million black households, about 45 percent, or 3.8 million families, are led
by lone women without partners present. Of the nation's 53.1 million white
households, only 13 percent are headed by women alone. The statistics are being

West All-Stars Defeat East 137-126
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- In the NBA All-Star game Sunday, it was a couple
nifty dunks from Vince Carter, a little Showtime from the Lakers, a few bank
shots from Tim Duncan and plenty of crisp passes from Jason Kidd. Everybody did
what they do best, with no single player stealing the spotlight. In a way, it
was a fitting first All-Star game of the post-Jordan era: Nobody is sure who the
next superstar is, and none burst forward in this game. Behind 24 points apiece
from Duncan and Kevin Garnett, 22 from Shaquille O'Neal and 14 assists from
Kidd, the West defeated the East 137-126 Sunday in the 49th version of the
league's showcase event.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Gen. Wiranto Suspended  </HEADLINE>
   By SLOBODAN LEKIC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- President Abdurrahman Wahid on Monday suspended
his powerful security chief, Gen. Wiranto, and instructed government
investigators to determine if he bears any responsibility for the widespread
violence in East Timor last year.
</P>
<P>
	   The move, which Wiranto quickly accepted, was the latest development in a
two-week standoff between the two men over whether Wiranto should quit the
Cabinet. The decision means the general will be temporarily relieved of his
duties while the probe is under way.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is to allow the process of investigation to proceed, to find out if
he is truly innocent or not,'' Wahid said.
</P>
<P>
	   The president was on an overseas tour when a human rights report implicated
Wiranto in the violence that devastated East Timor following its independence
vote in August. Wahid met with the general upon his return Sunday to Jakarta.
</P>
<P>
	   After the meeting, Wahid initially announced that Wiranto would remain part
of the government while the attorney general's office conducted a new formal
inquiry into the events in East Timor.
</P>
<P>
	   But late Sunday, the president -- who has been known to make strong
statements on issues only to change his stance later -- told Indonesian
reporters that Wiranto would be removed from the Cabinet for the time being.
Interior Minister Surjadi Sudirdja replaced him as minister for security and
political affairs.
</P>
<P>
	   At a swearing-in ceremony for Sudirdja, Wahid insisted the handover would
let Wiranto focus on defending himself from charges of failing to prevent the
East Timor violence as commander of the country's armed forces.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The decision is not (intended) to undermine Wiranto ... but purely to
protect Wiranto's right to protect himself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Wahid also insisted the original human rights probe had been biased against
the Indonesian military.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was unfair. That's why I've entrusted this matter to the attorney
general to investigate thoroughly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Indonesia's military chief, Adm. Widodo Adisutjipto, told journalists
following the ceremony that the armed forces were loyal to Wahid and would
respect his decision.
</P>
<P>
	   Speaking to reporters, Wiranto thanked the president for waiting until he
returned from his 16-day overseas trip to make a decision and ``to listen to my
position.''
</P>
<P>
	   He denied any wrongdoing regarding the events in East Timor, but said that
the suspension is Wahid's ``prerogative and must be accepted.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is the right of the president to make a decision about his Cabinet, and
we shouldn't make an uproar about this,'' he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   In Singapore, U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan welcomed the decision. ``I'm
pleased that the Indonesian government seems determined to hold those
responsible accountable,'' Annan told reporters on the second day of his
three-day visit to the city state as part of a larger Asian tour.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of people were killed and much of the province devastated during
attacks by anti-independence militants following East Timor's vote for
independence on Aug. 30. Indonesian soldiers have been accused of taking part in
some attacks and stepping back and allowing many others.
</P>
<P>
	   A separate U.N. human rights commission also has blamed Indonesia's top
brass for inciting the campaign of violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Soon after Wahid left on his overseas tour, the state-sponsored human rights
probe recommended that Wiranto be investigated. Wahid promptly demanded that
Wiranto resign, but the general refused and said he wanted to present his case
to the president in person.
</P>
<P>
	   Wiranto was a protege of Indonesia's former leader, Suharto, who ruled the
country with an iron fist for 32 years until he was ousted in 1998. Wiranto was
given the post of security minister last October when Wahid took office.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) -- A moderate quake today shook the northwestern province
of Bolu, causing fear among tens of thousands of people living in tents and
prefabricated dwellings after a deadly quake destroyed their homes in November.
</P>
<P>
	   There were no reports of damage or injury.
</P>
<P>
	   The quake had a preliminary magnitude of 5, the Istanbul-based Kandilli
observatory said. It was followed by a magnitude-3.8 aftershock.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 800 people were killed around Bolu by the Nov. 12 quake, which followed
a deadlier quake further west that killed more than 17,000 people in August.

<HEADLINE> Scholars Seek New Image of God  </HEADLINE>
   By WILLIAM McCALL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CORVALLIS, Ore. (AP) -- In 16th century Europe, the conversation would
likely have resulted in people being burned at the stake. But in 21st century
Oregon, it was merely a polite dialogue that drew laughter and applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Five Christians -- three of them women -- sat with a Jew and a Muslim before
an audience of more than 1,200 at Oregon State University, talking about the
need to change the face of God.
</P>
<P>
	   Many of them remarked that such a gathering in a secular academic setting
would have been unthinkable even a few decades ago, when religious common ground
was nearly vacant and being squeezed by both fundamentalism and science.
</P>
<P>
	   The two-day ``God at 2000'' conference at Oregon State University concluded
Sunday with a speech on traditional Christian principles by former South African
archbishop and Nobel Prize-winner Desmond Tutu.
</P>
<P>
	   Conference organizer and bestselling author Marcus Borg discussed the many
different views of God held by the enduring religions of the world, then pulled
together their underlying similarity.
</P>
<P>
	   The true essence of God, Borg found, was more of a duality -- a distant and
transcendent force that encompasses the universe while simultaneously dwelling
inside each person, immanent in each living thing, tying them all together.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a God was beyond religion, Borg said -- existing everywhere, touching
the consciousness of all things, without need for churches or even prayer. The
whole point of religion, he said, was simply to guide people to God, not to
serve as an end in itself.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I find it literally incredible that the God of the whole universe has
chosen to be known by just one religious tradition,'' said Borg.
</P>
<P>
	   Islamic scholar Seyyed Hossein Nasr described God as a ``placid lake.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are like snowflakes falling toward that lake, to dissolve and become
one again,'' Nasr said.
</P>
<P>
	   Harvard theologian and author Diana Eck talked about the vast richness of
Hindu imagery, with its multitude of faces for a single God, both masculine and
feminine.
</P>
<P>
	   She noted there already are more Muslims in the United States than
Presbyterians, and more Hindus than Episcopalians. But ``none of us owns the
universe of faith,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   Psychologist and Benedictine nun Joan Chittister hammered home another
conference theme in noting ``religion and spirituality are not synonymous.''
</P>
<P>
	   People are hungry for spiritual nourishment, she said, which can be seen as
a metaphor for a more feminine view of the very masculine, paternalistic God
handed down by centuries of Western religious tradition.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's never 'God our Mother''' in the Bible, Chittister said to laughter
and applause.
</P>
<P>
	   Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, a regular commentator on National Public Radio,
likened religions to mountain guides. Different religions offer different
equipment and different paths to God at the mountaintop, but eventually ``they
all get to the same place.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``The problem,'' he said to laughter, ``comes when they argue about what to
wear.''
</P>
<P>
	   The choice of which religion ``to wear'' may even be more difficult now
because technology has created a global community that shares religions rather
than isolating people, said Karen Armstrong, a former nun turned author and TV
commentator in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   Church attendance in Britain has sunk to 6 percent of the population, she
said, reflecting a widespread weariness of organized religion in Europe.
</P>
<P>
	   After taking vows as a teen, Armstrong said she had a miserable experience
while learning traditional Roman Catholic doctrine. She said she still finds
herself unable to pray, even though she has drawn together elements of Judaism,
Christianity and Islam to fashion her own religious beliefs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This kind of sharing would have been pretty unthinkable 150 years ago,''
she said. ``We can never think of religion in the same way again.''

<HEADLINE> PBS Listens to Opera's Black Voices  </HEADLINE>
    By MARY CAMPBELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Two title characters in famous Verdi operas are black: Aida
is an Ethiopian princess enslaved in Egypt, while Otello is a Moor sent from
Italy to rule Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
	   But the people who sing these and other important parts in opera usually are
not black. In fact, there seem to be fewer big roles for black singers at
America's big opera houses than ever before.
</P>
<P>
	   "Aida's Brothers and Sisters: Black Voices in Opera," a "Great Performances"
production from Thirteen/WNET, deals with the history and present status of
classically trained black singers in opera in America. The 90-minute show, which
includes some wonderful singing, airs on PBS Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   Contralto Marian Anderson was the first black singer in a major role at the
Metropolitan Opera, in 1955. She was 53 when she sang Ulrica, a sorceress, in
Verdi's "The Masked Ball." Associated Press critic W.G. Rogers wrote, "The only
color that mattered was the color of her voice, which has been one of the
richest and most moving in her generation."
</P>
<P>
	   Leontyne Price became the first black opera superstar. She sang Bess in
"Porgy and Bess" on Broadway and abroad for two years in the 1950s, and made her
Met debut at 33 in 1960. Though she sang such roles as Donna Anna in Mozart's
"Don Giovanni," everybody considered hers "a Verdi voice." She was called the
greatest Aida of her day.
</P>
<P>
	   Around the same time, Met audiences were applauding George Shirley, Grace
Bumbry, Reri Grist, Martina Arroyo and Shirley Verrett -- black singers cast in
important roles. "I thought we were on a roll," Verrett says from her office at
the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, where she teaches voice. "I thought we
were going to continue to get these voices, no matter what color."
</P>
<P>
	   Verrett sang at the Met 126 times between 1968 and 1990. Now, she says, "It
seems to be going backwards in the big houses. We're down to hardly any
African-Americans at the Met -- which had started so well. Across the U.S.,
there is still a lot of young black talent being heard."
</P>
<P>
	   Last season at the Met Opera, Denyce Graves, who made her Met debut as
Carmen, sang Dalila in "Samson and Dalila," and Gregg Baker had two big roles.
This season at the Met, Simon Estes, who made his Met debut in 1976, was the
only black singer scheduled for a big role.
</P>
<P>
	   "There are still African-Americans with beautiful voices around -- not
getting the opportunities to sing," Verrett says. She is convinced that
audiences don't care what the color of the singer on the opera stage is.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think we don't give people enough credit for acceptance," she says.
</P>
<P>
	   Verrett once sang Desdemona, Otello's white wife, in Boston. She says, "I
lightened my face up, just like a white man singing Otello darkens his face. The
opera starts. They forget. You're someone playing a part. What's the big deal?"
</P>
<P>
	   A factor in why small opera houses hire black singers for important roles,
Verrett thinks, is money. The National Endowment for the Arts doesn't give much
money to small opera houses, she says. But when it does, it stresses community
outreach and diversity.
</P>
<P>
	   Along with interviewing singers who've sung at the Metropolitan Opera,
"Aida's Brothers and Sisters" hears from Betty Allen, who made her career as a
recitalist, and Thomas Young, who had an important role in "X, the Life and
Times of Malcolm X" at the New York City Opera.
</P>
<P>
	   "When things were looking up for African-Americans in opera, I went for the
gold," Verrett says. "I was lucky and made it.
</P>
<P>
	   "At this moment, if young singers are willing to have a career singing in
the many opera houses around the country, one can still have a career."
</P>
<P>
	   But when asked about advising the students she teaches, Verrett says, "I
have one black male student in the musical theater department here. I give him
Mozart to sing and it's an operatic sound, a beautiful, rich sound.
</P>
<P>
	   "I tell him he's probably choosing right to take the Broadway path instead
of opera at this point."

<HEADLINE> Senator's Ex-Aide Won't Sue Him  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM ABRAMS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A former senior aide to Sen. Max Baucus has dropped a
legal claim that the senator fired her after she rebuffed his sexual advances.
</P>
<P>
	   The Montana Democrat, in a statement Monday, said the decision of former
chief of staff Christine Niedermeier to abandon the case backed up his
assertions that ``her accusations were completely false.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I have never harassed her or retaliated against her. These are the facts
and that's the truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Niedermeier maintained that she was telling the truth but had decided that
she could not afford the emotional and financial toll that a lawsuit would take.
</P>
<P>
	   Niedermeier, 48, made her complaint last September to the Office of
Compliance, an independent legislative agency created in 1995 in the wake of the
sexual harassment scandal that forced former Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., to
resign.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the 1995 act, the office provides mediation and a hearing process and
gives the employee 90 days after mediation efforts end to file a claim in
federal district court. That 90-day period ended Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   Niedermeier had charged that Baucus, 58 and married, had made repeated
sexual advances during the 15 months she was chief of staff, and that had Baucus
fired her last August for rejecting those advances.
</P>
<P>
	   Baucus said he fired her because her abusive treatment of staff affected
office operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Niedermeier, in a statement, indicated she turned down a Baucus offer of
money and the ``prospect of a job'' in exchange for recanting her accusations.
She declined to offer details, citing confidentiality requirements of the
settlement process.
</P>
<P>
	   ``My integrity is intact,'' she said. ``I will not lie about what I believe
to be the true reasons for Sen. Baucus' termination of me, in exchange for any
amount of money or the prospect of a job.''
</P>
<P>
	   But Baucus' lawyer, Jean Manning, said Niedermeier's statement was false and
that her decision not to file her claim proved the senator's innocence.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We think he's been totally vindicated by her choice not to pursue the
claim,'' Manning said.
</P>
<P>
	   She also disputed Niedermeier's statement that she was forced to abandon the
case because of costs. Manning said Niedermeier could have opted for an Office
of Compliance administrative procedure where there are no legal costs but the
remedies are the same as for a court case.

<HEADLINE> Volvo Sales Up on Commercial Focus  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo said Monday its earnings increased nearly
fourfold last year on strong sales after it sold its car division to Ford Motor
Co. and turned its focus to trucks and buses.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swedish automaker reported net income equivalent to $3.74 billion for
the year ending Dec. 31, up from nearly $976 million in 1998. Operating profits
were $$761 million in 1999, down from $1.15 billion in 1998. Earnings per share,
excluding non-recurring items, were $1.44, down from $1.63 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Net sales fell to $14.5 billion in 1999 from $24.76 billion in 1998, but
they showed a 9 percent increase from $13.3 billion when 1998 car sales were
excluded.
</P>
<P>
	   Volvo's chief executive, Leif Johansson, said the automaker was succeeding
in its aim of focusing operations on vehicles for commercial use and was hoping
for a European Union antitrust decision no later than March 23 on its
acquisition of Swedish rival truck and bus maker Scania.
</P>
<P>
	   "The objective is to create a larger and stronger industrial base from which
we will develop and broaden the line of products we are offering customers,"
Johansson said in a statement. "The acquisition of Scania will yield savings
over the short term."
</P>
<P>
	   Volvo, which announced the $6.5 billion sale of its passenger car division
to Ford in January 1999, has about 52,500 employees worldwide. Scania has
23,500. The merger with Scania, which would remain a separate division and
retain its trademarks and distribution operations, would create the world's
second-largest truck and bus maker, behind DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
	   For Volvo's largest business area, trucks, operating profit rose 28 percent
to $454.9 million in 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   While U.S. truck deliveries grew 17 percent, the company had problems
meeting the strong demand and its U.S. market share for heavy trucks declined to
10.7 percent from 11.5 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Johansson said the company expected the North American truck market to
weaken this year but that this would be offset by an anticipated increase in
demand in Asia and South America.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, Volvo's board said it would ask shareholders at an upcoming
meeting for a mandate to buy back shares and for permission to use these as
payment in possible future transactions.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Optimistic About Mideast  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today that the Middle East peace
process is ``in a little tough patch right now'' but that he remains optimistic
about reaching agreements between Israel and the Syrians, Palestinians and
Lebanese.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I am basically optimistic,'' the president said in an interview with CNN.
He said he hoped for progress in the next few weeks. He said peace was clearly
in the interest of all parties and ``we're so close on the substance.''
</P>
<P>
	   The president was interviewed in the Oval Office in what was billed as his
first online news interview. It was broadcast live on CNN and available online
as well.
</P>
<P>
	   Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria were suspended last month
without a date for resumption. Progress on the Israel-Syria track is expected to
determine what happens in peace talks with Lebanon. On another front, Israel and
the Palestinians missed a target date Sunday for reaching the framework of an
eventual peace accord.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about the Senate race of his wife, Hillary, Clinton said it was
difficult to listen to criticism of the first lady in the heat of political
battle. He said now he knows how she felt all those years as he underwent
attacks. Clinton said ``it drives me nuts'' that he cannot stand up and rebut
critics of the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   The president ducked the first question of the interview, when he was asked
to share his thoughts about Republican presidential candidates John McCain and
George W. Bush. ``I think I should pass on that,'' the president said. ``I just
don't think I should get into the middle of this presidential race ... Anything
I do would only complicate their lives.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that recent hacker attacks against prominent Internet sites
were ``obviously very disturbing'' but said it was ``important for the American
people not to overreact.'' He said ``This is a replay of things that have
happened throughout our history'' as the United States has had to deal with
security issues.
</P>
<P>
	   On foreign policy, Clinton said there was not a parallel between Russia's
crackdown in Chechnya and Serb violence last year in Kosovo. He said Western
nations have spoken out about excesses in Chechnya, even though they have not
responded with military force.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, the president said the United States has made clear that it does not
condone the politics of Jorg Haider's far-right Freedom Party in Austria. But he
cautioned that the world needs to strike ``a delicate balance'' because Austria
is a democracy and Haider's party was elected on a broad platform.

<HEADLINE> Tester Says Pentagon Moves Too Fast  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is moving too rapidly toward a
recommendation to President Clinton on whether its national missile defense
project is ready for deployment, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report to Congress and Defense Secretary William Cohen, Philip E.
Coyle, director of testing and evaluation, questioned Cohen's plan to review the
project's status in June. On the basis of that review Cohen is to make his
recommendation to the president on whether to move ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   The schedule for a June review puts ``unrealistic pressure'' on the
project's managers, Coyle wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The system as envisioned by the Pentagon would use a network of radars and
silo-based interceptor missiles to detect, track and shoot down long-range
ballistic missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere. Congress has required the
administration to deploy such a system as soon as technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Cohen so far has said he intends to stick to the June timetable,
Coyle wrote that ``undo pressure has been placed on the program to meet an
artificial decision point in the development process.''
</P>
<P>
	   So far there have been two tests of the system's ability to intercept a
target missile in space. The first, last fall, was successful. The second, in
January, was not.
</P>
<P>
	   The next test -- scheduled to be the last before the June readiness review
-- is unlikely to take place before mid-May, although no firm date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the failure of the January test, Coyle said, more time should be
allowed for analyzing the results of the next test before Cohen makes his
recommendation to the president. He did not say how much more time was needed,
but normally the analysis takes two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus if the next test were in May, the review in preparation for a
recommendation to Clinton would not be done before July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would provide a clear technical understanding of the results and
avoid forcing the (readiness review) before the analysis is complete,'' Coyle
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has budgeted $12.7 billion for the national missile defense
project over the next five years. Coyle's report says that if the system is
deployed in 2005, as called for in the current schedule, the total cost --
including development, production, construction and operating it for 20 years --
would be $26.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> News Corp. May Create Satellite Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp., the far-flung media empire controlled by Rupert
Murdoch, may consolidate its satellite businesses into one unit.
</P>
<P>
	   The company said Monday it was too soon to say exactly which assets would be
pooled into the new business or whether it would be publicly traded, as is News
Corp.'s entertainment subsidiary, Fox Entertainment Group.
</P>
<P>
	   News Corp. issued a statement on the matter after an article appeared in
Monday editions of The Wall Street Journal saying the company was planning to
group its various satellite operations into a new, publicly traded company.
</P>
<P>
	   If the consolidation comes to pass, it would represent a bet on Murdoch's
part that satellite TV will play a major role in delivering TV signals as well
as other types of entertainment and media into homes outside the U.S., where
News Corp.'s satellite presence is strongest.
</P>
<P>
	   News Corp.'s holdings in satellite TV include a 40 percent stake in British
broadcaster BSKyB, a minority stake in Sky Latin America, a stake in a Japanese
broadcaster and several stakes in European satellite broadcasters including
Stream in Italy.
</P>
<P>
	   In the United States, major media players like AT&AMP;T as well as AOL and Time
Warner, which recently agreed to merge, are betting that cable TV lines will be
the main delivery vehicle of choice for voice, data, and other types of media in
the future.

<HEADLINE> Treasury Auction Interest Rates Fall  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Interest rates on short-term Treasury securities fell in
Monday's auction.
</P>
<P>
	   The Treasury Department sold $9 billion in three-month bills at a discount
rate of 5.510 percent, down from 5.545 percent last week. An additional $8
billion was sold in six-month bills at a rate of 5.760 percent, down from 5.770
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The three-month rate was the lowest since Jan. 24 when the bills sold for
5.385 percent. The six-month rate was the lowest since Jan 31 when the rate was
5.705.
</P>
<P>
	   The new discount rates understate the actual return to investors -- 5.682
percent for three-month bills with a $10,000 bill selling for $9,860.70 and
6.032 percent for a six-month bill selling for $9,708.80.
</P>
<P>
	   In a separate report, the Federal Reserve said Monday that the average yield
for one-year Treasury bills, the most popular index for making changes in
adjustable rate mortgages, fell to 6.20 percent last week from 6.24 percent the
previous week.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips Higher; Dow Up 79.74  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks sprinted higher today amid bargain-hunting
after Friday's sharp selloff, but technology stocks lagged behind as traders
took profits from their recent gains.
</P>
<P>
	   In afternoon trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was up
79.74 at 10,504.95.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 3.20 at 1,383.92, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 27.87 at
4,367.58.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks rose as investors sought bargains following last week's big
drop. The Dow had its worst week since October, falling 538.59 points, including
a 218.42-point drop on Friday that knocked the index 11 percent below its
January peak.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks have been rattled in recent weeks by investors' worries that if the
Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year, most companies will
struggle to maintain strong profit growth. Technology companies, which are
growing faster than industrial and cyclical companies, have held up much better.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, United Technologies rose 2 11/16 to 51 1/16, and Exxon Mobil rose 2
5/8 to 76 1/2. American Express gained 2 15/16 to 156 7/16. All three are Dow
components.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, software maker Medical Manager Corp. soared 22 3/16 to 87
3/16 after agreeing to be acquired by Healtheon/WebMD, a provider of health care
information.
</P>
<P>
	   NetOptix rose 16 1/16 to 152 1/16 on the news that it will be acquired by
Corning for $149.18 per share, or about $2 billion in stock. NetOptix makes
filters used in fiber-optic technology.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were some signs of profit-taking among high-tech leaders. Qualcomm
fell 6 5/8 to 125 3/8, and Cisco Systems was down 2 15/16 to 128.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts were heartened by the Dow's recovery today, most believe the
long-term trend toward technology stocks won't change any time soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stock selection should be focused on those companies with strong earnings
momentum, which would be mainly technology stocks," said John H. Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks received some additional support today from Abby Joseph Cohen, chief
market strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. Cohen, one of Wall Street's most
consistently bullish analysts, reiterated her expectation that the S&AMP;P 500 will
reach 1,525 by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In her comments to the firm's sales force, Cohen also said profit growth and
economic expansion remain strong, providing a solid base for stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 5-to-4 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 615.45 million shares, compared with 670.84
at the same time Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.46 to 535.64.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Bribery Treaty Takes Effect  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- American companies have lost tens of billions of dollars
in international contracts in which bribes were involved, the State Department
said Monday as a new anti-bribery treaty signed by 34 countries took effect.
</P>
<P>
	   In many countries bribery is part of doing business, and some even permit
companies to claim bribery as a tax deduction, which hurts development of
democracy and international trade, Undersecretary Alan P. Larson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reducing bribery will encourage investment in countries in which it is now
common practice, Larson told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   He said he could not calculate precisely losses to American companies
because there may be no way to know in some cases if the American company would
have been awarded a contract if there was no bribery.
</P>
<P>
	   The purpose of the treaty is to oblige states that are parties to it to make
it a crime to bribe foreign officials in conducting international business.
</P>
<P>
	   Larson said one way to deal with the problem is to take decisions on
contracts out of the hands of the bureaucracy and into the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, 13 of the 34 countries that have signed the treaty have not
ratified it, and only 12 of the 34 have enacted laws to implement it.

<HEADLINE> Baffling Rise in Lymphoma Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By LAURAN NEERGAARD AP Medical Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- It started with flu-like symptoms that Michael Locher
just couldn't shake. Then an egg-shaped lump ballooned on his jaw, and his
doctor knew -- the New York man was a victim of the nation's baffling rise in
lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as many other types of cancer have leveled off or even dropped, this
mysterious immune-system cancer has been making a stealthy but astounding rise;
rates have nearly doubled since the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
	   Is diet to blame? Pesticides? Air pollution? Viruses? Obesity? Nobody knows.
</P>
<P>
	   Cancer experts are launching major studies worldwide to find what's behind
this cancer's march.
</P>
<P>
	   But there is good news: Doctors are testing highly promising new
immunotherapies for the worst type, non-Hodgkins lymphoma. They include a potent
-- but still experimental -- "monoclonal antibody" called Bexxar that carries
radiation straight to cancer cells to zap them without hurting healthy tissue.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is just amazing," said Locher, a New York City Transit Authority
engineer whose tumors vanished last fall after he took Bexxar in a medical
experiment.
</P>
<P>
	   "The results have looked very, very promising," says Dr. Wyndham Wilson of
the National Cancer Institute. "What's even more exciting is that there are now
a whole number of different monoclonal antibodies coming forward" to attack
numerous varieties of lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Plus, NCI scientists are developing experimental vaccines customized to
patients' cancers in hopes of preventing hidden lymphoma cells from staging a
comeback after chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 62,300 Americans will be diagnosed this year with lymphoma, in which
vital immune cells stored in the lymph system become malignant. Over 27,000 will
die this year.
</P>
<P>
	   It's a cancer that doesn't make many headlines -- lung, prostate, breast and
colon cancer strike more often. Yet some 450,000 Americans are estimated to
already be living with lymphoma, one of the few cancers still rising, and unlike
many other cancers, doctors can offer no advice on preventing lymphoma and have
no early-detection tests.
</P>
<P>
	   About 7,400 of the new cases will be the often curable Hodgkin's disease.
</P>
<P>
	   The rest are non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, a catchall term that encompasses some
30 cancer subtypes whose prognosis and treatment all differ. Some are so
slow-growing that patients survive many years, cycling between therapy and
remission and yet more therapy. Others are highly aggressive and rapidly fatal.
Still others fall in between.
</P>
<P>
	   Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is the type rising so dramatically, not just here but
in most industrialized countries, said Dr. Marshall Lichtman of the Leukemia &AMP;
Lymphoma Society.
</P>
<P>
	   The AIDS virus caused some of the increase. Lymphoma is much more common in
people with weakened immune systems.
</P>
<P>
	   The list of other suspects is long but unproven: herbicides, pesticides,
benzene-polluted air, the Epstein-Barr virus. One recent study suggests being
overweight increases risk. A new theory that sunburns lower immune function has
scientists considering a lymphoma link.
</P>
<P>
	   On the flip side, University of California, San Francisco, scientists
recently discovered people with bad allergies might be at lower risk. The theory
is that allergies might indicate a vigorous immune system that can handle
lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
	   "The immune perturbations that give you lymphoma are pretty complex. This is
not going to be the equivalent of lung cancer and smoking -- it's going to be a
little more subtle to tease out," cautions NCI epidemiologist Patricia Hartge,
who just began a large study in Detroit, Los Angeles, Seattle and Iowa to
pinpoint risk factors.
</P>
<P>
	   Similar studies are planned in Spain, Germany, Italy and Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   But the big news is in experimental immunotherapy -- genetically engineering
cells called "monoclonal antibodies" that seek out cancer and trigger the immune
system to attack it.
</P>
<P>
	   One, called Rituxan, already is sold, targeting lymphomas that carry an
antigen called CD20. Now scientists are developing monoclonal antibodies to
target CD30, CD22 and CD25 antigens -- and thus treat more types of lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
	   Bexxar is poised to become the first radiation-tagged monoclonal antibody,
carrying radioactive iodine to zap lymphoma cells. Manufacturer Coulter
Pharmaceutical Inc. will soon seek government approval for Bexxar to treat
certain "low grade" lymphomas that relapse after chemotherapy; doctors now are
studying if it works against other types.
</P>
<P>
	   ------
</P>
<P>
	   Many lymphoma symptoms are common to other illnesses and hard to pin down,
but see your doctor if the following occur for more than two weeks, advises the
Leukemia &AMP; Lymphoma Society:
</P>
<P>
	   --Painless swelling of lymph glands in the neck, armpit or groin
</P>
<P>
	   --Fatigue, recurrent high fever, night sweats, itching and/or general aches,
sometimes described as flulike.
</P>
<P>
	   --Weight loss, loss of appetite, indigestion and abdominal pain or a sense
of fullness, which could come from an enlarged spleen or lymph nodes.
</P>
<P>
	   Prognosis and treatment depends on the patient's specific subtype and stage
of lymphoma, and there are new standards to help classify patients properly,
said Dr. Wyndham Wilson of the National Cancer Institute. He advises seeing
oncologists who treat large numbers of lymphoma patients, as they are most
likely to be up-to-date on those standards and the latest treatments.

	   Business Inventories See Modest Growth
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. companies boosted their inventories by a
modest 0.5 percent in December but their sales vaulted ahead at
more than twice that pace, a sign that businesses are struggling to
keep up with hardy demand, economists said. For the 12th straight
month, companies added to their stockpiles of goods on shelves and
backlots pushing total business inventories in December to a
seasonally adjusted $1.14 trillion, the Commerce Department said
today. At the same time, sales grew by a sizzling 1.1 percent in
December to $868.8 billion. That increase brought the
inventory-to-sales ratio to a record low of 1.32, meaning it would
take 1.32 months to exhaust inventories at the December sales pace.

	   Asian PC Sales Hit All-Time High
</P>
<P>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Personal computer sales hit an all-time high in
East Asia and the Pacific excluding Japan in 1999, as the region
shook off its economic crisis, according to a report released
today. Just over 14.1 million PCs were sold last year,
International Data Corporation Asia-Pacific said in its latest
report. In 1998, sales were 10.5 million, a slight decline from
1997. ``After two very tumultuous years, the Asian PC market
returned to the fast track in 1999,'' said IDC Asia-Pacific
research manager Kitty Fok. High sales potential in the ``vast
untapped markets'' of China and India, along with growing Internet
use, will soon ``enable Asia to regain its position as the hottest
PC market in the world,'' Fok said. South Korea was the country
that contributed most to the Asian PC boom. PC sales there shot up
by 79.2 percent to a total of 2.19 million units in 1999.

	   Maytag Warns of Weaker Earnings
</P>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag shares tumbled more than 8
percent today after the appliance maker warned of weaker earnings
due to expected flat sales in its home appliances, increased
competition in floor care products and decreased sales of vending
machines. Maytag said its earnings per share could be off 10
percent or more from 1999's record first quarter performance of 95
cents a share. In morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange,
Maytag shares were down $3.06 1/4 a share -- 8.4 percent -- to $33.31 1/4 a
share. Today's report follows strong sales in Maytag's
fourth-quarter of 1999, which were up 7.7 percent from the same
period a year earlier.

profit in the fourth quarter rose fivefold due to rising
admissions. Excluding one-time events and unusual charges, the
company said Monday that it made a fourth quarter profit of $159
million or 28 cents per share, compared to a profit of $27 million
or 4 cents per share in the same period a year ago. Results matched
Wall Street's expectations, according to First Call/Thomson
Financial. The company's net income, including gains on sales of
facilities and restructuring of operations and costs related to a
federal fraud investigation, was $91 million, or 16 cents per
share, up from a net loss of $42 million, or 6 cents a share a year
ago.

	   GOTEBORG, Sweden (AP) -- Volvo said Monday its earnings increased

division to Ford Motor Co. and turned its focus to trucks and
buses. The Swedish automaker reported net income equivalent to
$3.74 billion for the year ending Dec. 31, up from nearly $976
million in 1998. Operating profits were $$761 million in 1999, down
from $1.15 billion in 1998. Earnings per share, excluding
non-recurring items, were $1.44, down from $1.63 in 1998. Net sales
fell to $14.5 billion in 1999 from $24.76 billion in 1998, but they
showed a 9 percent increase from $13.3 billion when 1998 car sales
were excluded.

downturn in its second-quarter performance has impaired its ability
to finance its operations. The office products supplier is
currently in default on the adjusted net worth covenant provision
of its loan and security agreement and is seeking a waiver from its
lender. For the quarter ended Dec. 31, Smith Corona reported a net
loss of $3.6 million, or $1.14 per share, on sales of $7.6 million.

<HEADLINE> French Celebrities Honor Vadim  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Actress Catherine Deneuve and a host of other French
celebrities gathered at Paris' St-Germain-des-Pres church Monday for a memorial
service for filmmaker Roger Vadim.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim, who died of cancer Friday at age 72, was best known for provocative
films such as ``And God Created Woman'' and ``Barbarella.'' He was also renowned
for his series of marriages to, and love affairs with, some of the world's most
sought-after actresses -- Deneuve, Brigitte Bardot and Jane Fonda among them.
</P>
<P>
	   Hundreds of guests arrived in light rain as photographers snapped pictures
with the chic Left Bank neighborhood's cafes as a backdrop. Hundreds of other
people crowded around police lines, trying to steal a glimpse of the arriving
luminaries.
</P>
<P>
	   The crowd erupted in murmurs as a regal Deneuve entered the dark church,
recognizable despite dark sunglasses and a red scarf tied over her head.
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim and Deneuve's son, Christian, thanked the mourners for coming and
asked them to smile and pray for his father.
</P>
<P>
	   Actress Marie-Christine Barrault, who married Vadim in 1990, read a poem in
her husband's memory as tears stood out in her eyes.
</P>
<P>
	   Neither Fonda nor Bardot attended the service.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, Fonda, who starred in ``Barbarella,'' said she
visited her ex-husband in the hospital just before his death. Bardot, whose
career took off after she starred in ``And God Created Woman,'' told a newspaper
Sunday that Vadim was ``irreplaceable.''
</P>
<P>
	   Vadim will be buried in Saint-Tropez on Friday.

<HEADLINE> ABA Debates Nonlawyer Partnerships  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- The American Bar Association, trying to avoid both rushing to
judgment and dragging its heels, is struggling to decide whether to let lawyers
join accountants and other professionals in offering clients one-stop shopping
for a variety of services.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts to forge a coherent policy consumed much of the ABA's six-day
national convention that ended Monday, but a resolution is not expected before
August at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   "This may well be the most important issue confronting the profession for
several decades," ABA President William Paul said at the start of a three-hour
"town meeting" Sunday at which an overflow crowd in attendance and those
watching a live Internet broadcast offered comments and questioned experts.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called multidiscipline practices also were topics of several other
convention programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger of law firms with other professionals such as accountants,
psychologists and social workers is barred in most states by ethical provisions
that mirror an ABA model rule. But the phenomenon of financial service companies
employing lawyers, especially the Big Five accounting firms, is growing in many
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   When doing business in the United States, those lawyers sometimes find
themselves in a gray legal area.
</P>
<P>
	   Many lawyers view the spread of such mergers as inevitable, but ABA leaders
worry about who is going to control them. And a big initial hurdle is the
long-standing ban on lawyers' forming partnerships and sharing fees with
nonlawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   While admitting that dropping the ban may make legal services more
accessible for many consumers, ABA leaders also worry over how to protect
lawyers' independent judgment and confidential client information and avoid
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing those problems, the ABA's House of Delegates, which makes policy for
the 400,000-member association, put off last August a vote on the rule change.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 305-118 vote Monday, the delegates passed a resolution urging lawyers
nationwide help state regulators of the profession to enforce ethical rules more
actively against the unauthorized practice of law.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland, Ohio, lawyer Leslie Jacobs, a prime backer of the resolution,
said current enforcement is "the equivalent of a tax system with no IRS. What we
have is a network of scofflaws who are simply being ignored."
</P>
<P>
	   The vote came after several unsuccessful attempts to narrow the resolution's
target to nonlawyers and carve out exceptions for multidiscipline practices and
lawyers whose practices encompass more than one state.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the ABA eventually changes its model ethics rule, each state would
have to follow suit before the cloud of illegality would be removed from such
mergers.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABA's preference for keeping lawyers in charge of any type of business
that includes giving legal advice is called by Albert Foer, president of the
American Antitrust Institute, "nothing more than an effort to protect lawyers
and law firms from competition."
</P>
<P>
	   "I find it sad that so many members of the legal profession are apparently
intent on denying consumers access to much-needed legal services," Foer said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Condemns Violence in Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States condemned the latest violence in Kosovo
on Monday, blaming both ethnic Albanians and Serbs for incidents in the city of
Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly more needs to be done to restore stability under these
exceptionally dangerous and challenging circumstances,'' State Department
spokesman James Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   He condemned violence in which snipers wounded two French soldiers. French
members of the NATO peacekeeping force fired back, killing one sniper and
wounding five others.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the snipers were identified by NATO as Albanian, Rubin said both
sides have contributed to recent violence.
</P>
<P>
	   Let me start by saying that we strongly condemn the violent and murderous
incidents that have taken place in Mitrovica and call upon all parties to cease
violent acts,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
	   He said U.S. officials support the increase of NATO forces in Mitrovica and
the imposition of a dusk-to-dawn curfew.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It should be very clear that the confrontation is coming from both
sides,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the incidents, he said, tensions overall are being reduced every day
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Week after week and place after place in Kosovo, the situation has
improved in terms of security, in terms of murder, in terms of robbery and
crime,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Rubin described Mitrovica as a ``hot spot,'' however, and said, ``We need to
impress upon the parties their responsibility to deal with the hatreds and
animosities that have been built up'' and stoked by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When things go bad, he feels like he had a good day,'' said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 50,000 NATO peacekeepers were sent to Kosovo after last year's 78-day
Western bombing campaign that forced Milosevic to halt a crackdown on ethnic
Albanians.

<HEADLINE> Charged Hijackers Appear in Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Thirteen men appeared in court Monday, charged with hijacking
of an Afghan airliner.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, ranging in age from 18 to 36, are charged with seizing an aircraft
and its passengers Feb. 6 contrary to the Aviation Security Act of 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   Southend magistrate Kevin Gray remanded all of them into police custody. The
men, who used interpreters, spoke only to confirm their names. None asked for
bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The next hearing was scheduled for March 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Police named the men as brothers Muhammad Sediqui, 36, and Mohammad Sediqui,
30; Ali Safi, 34; Mohammad Safi, 32; Abdul Showaib, 20; Mohammed Showaib, 25;
Khalil Ullah, 30; Muhammad Kazem, 27; Waheed Lufti, 22; Reshad Ahmodi, 18;
Nazamuddin Mohammidy, 26; Taimur Shah, 28, and Ghayur Abdul, 24.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear if the men named Safi and Showaib were related.
</P>
<P>
	   Police said six men had been released without charge after questioning. One
man was removed for further questioning from the passengers remaining in
Britain, most of whom are seeking asylum. Home Secretary Jack Straw said Monday
that 69 people have formally applied for asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, 73 of the hijacked passengers returned to Kandahar,
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was hijacked Feb. 6 and made a series of stops in
Central Asia and Russia before landing in Britain, where police negotiated a
peaceful end to the drama on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Office said Monday that some of the asylum-seekers could be
dispersed to the United States, India and Pakistan. Discussions also were under
way with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Goldfish in Blenders Spark Outrage  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN WIENBERG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- The art display at the small museum in western
Denmark features 10 goldfish, each swimming in its own blender. The catch: Each
blender can be turned on, depending on the viewer's whim.
</P>
<P>
	   The display, which opened Friday, has caused outrage among animal rights
activists and drawn unusually large crowds to the Trapholt Art Museum. Two fish
were blended at the opening, and police ordered the plugs pulled after a local
group, the Union for the Protection of Animals, complained.
</P>
<P>
	   Museum director Peter Meyer said five more fish were blended on Sunday. Five
surviving fish were also stolen from their blender aquariums over the weekend,
but the museum replaces the goldfish to maintain the original work of art, Meyer
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Police Sgt. Poul Henning Christensen said an investigation was under way and
museum organizers could face fines if they disregarded orders to cut off the
power to the blenders.
</P>
<P>
	   The museum in Kolding, 125 miles west of Copenhagen, is one of many smaller
art exhibitors in the Nordic country. It draws about 80,000 visitors each year.
This weekend, though, it had 1,000 curious visitors -- a very high off-season
number, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm glad for all the publicity because people now come in and see the
whole exhibition we have at the museum,'' Meyer said. He said he had not
expected such interest -- nor that people would actually turn on the blenders, a
move which requires flicking on a main power switch as well as that on the
individual blender.
</P>
<P>
	   Animal rights groups have fumed at the museum and the publicity it has
received over the exhibit. They say that even if the blenders aren't turned on,
the fish still suffer from a lack of oxygen or vegetation.
</P>
<P>
	   Meyer defended the work. He said it doesn't encourage people to blend the
fish, but instead addresses ethical questions in society.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have abortions and we have respirators where we choose whether to keep
people alive or not. We have become rulers of the decision on life and death in
a new way,'' he said. ``This work of art exemplifies this decision in a precise
image.''
</P>
<P>
	   The display by Danish artist Marco Evaristti includes the blenders on a
table, a nude picture of the artist with blackened eyes and a bazooka missile
surrounded by tubes of lipstick.
</P>
<P>
	   Evaristti plans to take his work on tour to Chile, Argentina, Brazil and
Spain over the next two years.

<HEADLINE> Tester Says Pentagon Moves Too Fast  </HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT BURNS AP Military Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Pentagon is moving too rapidly toward a
recommendation to President Clinton on whether its national missile defense
project is ready for deployment, the Pentagon's chief weapons tester said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In a report to Congress and Defense Secretary William Cohen, Philip E.
Coyle, director of testing and evaluation, questioned Cohen's plan to review the
project's status in June. On the basis of that review Cohen is to make his
recommendation to the president on whether to move ahead with deployment.
</P>
<P>
	   The schedule for a June review puts ``unrealistic pressure'' on the
project's managers, Coyle wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The system as envisioned by the Pentagon would use a network of radars and
silo-based interceptor missiles to detect, track and shoot down long-range
ballistic missiles outside the Earth's atmosphere. Congress has required the
administration to deploy such a system as soon as technologically feasible.
</P>
<P>
	   Noting that Cohen so far has said he intends to stick to the June timetable,
Coyle wrote that ``undo pressure has been placed on the program to meet an
artificial decision point in the development process.''
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Collina of the Union of Concerned Scientists, a leading critic of
national missile defense, said of Coyle's conclusion: ``He's exactly right.''
Collina credited Coyle with ``very interesting honesty'' in telling Congress and
Cohen that the timetable for decisions on missile defense has become too
compressed.
</P>
<P>
	   So far there have been two tests of the system's ability to intercept a
target missile in space. The first, last fall, was successful. The second, in
January, was not.
</P>
<P>
	   The next test -- scheduled to be the last before the June readiness review
-- is unlikely to take place before mid-May, although no firm date has been set.
</P>
<P>
	   In light of the failure of the January test, Coyle said, more time should be
allowed for analyzing the results of the next test before Cohen makes his
recommendation to the president. He did not say how much more time was needed,
but normally the analysis takes two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Thus if the next test were in May, the review in preparation for a
recommendation to Clinton would not be done before July.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This would provide a clear technical understanding of the results and
avoid forcing the (readiness review) before the analysis is complete,'' Coyle
wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The Pentagon has budgeted $12.7 billion for the national missile defense
project over the next five years. Coyle's report says that if the system is
deployed in 2005, as called for in the current schedule, the total cost --
including development, production, construction and operating it for 20 years --
would be $26.6 billion.

<HEADLINE> Dow Up 34.36; Nasdaq Down 4.16  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks were higher today amid bargain-hunting
after Friday's sharp selloff, but technology stocks lagged as traders took
profits from their recent gains.
</P>
<P>
	   With an hour remaining in Wall Street's regular session, the Dow Jones
industrial average was up 34.36 at 10,459.57.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index
was down 4.16 at 1,382.96, and the Nasdaq composite index was down 24.17 at
4,371.28.
</P>
<P>
	   Blue-chip stocks rose as investors sought bargains following last week's big
drop. The Dow had its worst week since October, falling 538.59 points, including
a 218.42-point drop on Friday that knocked the index 11 percent below its
January peak.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks have been rattled in recent weeks by investors' worries that if the
Federal Reserve continues raising interest rates this year, most companies will
struggle to maintain strong profit growth. Technology companies, which are
growing faster than industrial and cyclical companies, have held up much better.
</P>
<P>
	   Today, Alcoa rose 3 15/16 to 71 5/8, United Technologies rose 2 1/16 to 50
7/16, and Exxon Mobil rose 2 3/4 to 38 3/4. All three are Dow components.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, software maker Medical Manager Corp. soared 22 1/4 to 87 1/4
after agreeing to be acquired by Healtheon/WebMD, a provider of health care
information.
</P>
<P>
	   NetOptix rose 17 1/4 to 153 1/4 on the news that it will be acquired by
Corning for $149.18 per share, or about $2 billion in stock. NetOptix makes
filters used in fiber-optic technology.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were some signs of profit-taking among high-tech leaders. Qualcomm
fell 6 5/16 to 125 11/16, and Cisco Systems was down 1 7/8 to 129 1/16.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts were heartened by the Dow's recovery today, most believe the
long-term trend toward technology stocks won't change any time soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stock selection should be focused on those companies with strong earnings
momentum, which would be mainly technology stocks," said John H. Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks received some additional support today from Abby Joseph Cohen, chief
market strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. Cohen, one of Wall Street's most
consistently bullish analysts, reiterated her expectation that the S&AMP;P 500 will
reach 1,525 by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In her comments to the firm's sales force, Cohen also said profit growth and
economic expansion remain strong, providing a solid base for stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 6-to-5 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, where volume came to 734.72 million shares late in the session,
compared with 809.50 at the same time Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 1.07 to 536.03.

<HEADLINE> Fan Gives Julianne Moore Valentine  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    BERLIN (AP) -- "Magnolia" star Julianne Moore received a heart-shaped
balloon from an admirer Monday at the Berlin International Film Festival and
admitted, "You're my first Valentine of the day."
</P>
<P>
	   "Magnolia," an epic tale of a day in the life of residents of the San
Fernando Valley in Los Angeles, is among 21 films competing at the festival for
a Golden Bear. Its official screening was Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Though much of "Magnolia" portrays the darkness of dysfunctional and abusive
families, director Paul Thomas Anderson said the movie's message is optimistic.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think you have to show the darkness to show hope," Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
	   Moore, who won a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in the movie, said
the film reflects American attitudes. "Our land is predisposed to optimism," she
said. "Our country was founded on the idea that anything here is possible."
</P>
<P>
	   Tom Cruise, who also won a Golden Globe for his role in the movie, is not
attending the festival, which runs through Saturday.

<HEADLINE> Prince Rainier Continues Recovery  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) -- Prince Rainier's heart and lungs were in good
shape Monday as he recovered from his second operation in two weeks, his doctors
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The emergency surgery was ordered Saturday after air was discovered escaping
from a lung and building up in his chest cavity. The condition, known as
pneumothorax, can cause the lung to collapse if left untreated.
</P>
<P>
	   Two drains were inserted into the prince's rib cage to aid his breathing.
</P>
<P>
	   A statement from the prince's doctors said his recovery was ``satisfying
with, notably, a very good cardio-respiratory state.''
</P>
<P>
	   Before the latest surgery, Rainier, 76, had been hospitalized while
recovering from a Feb. 2 operation. Doctors removed part of his lung to examine
a small growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Doctors said the growth was no cause for alarm. They have not said whether
it was cancerous.
</P>
<P>
	   The prince, who has ruled Monaco for the past 50 years, also had an
operation in December to repair an aneurysm in his abdominal aorta.

<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- When you're 18, it's hard to read bad rumors about yourself
-- especially when they're on the news stand for all the world to see, says
Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
	   The pop star tells USA Weekend magazine in its upcoming issue that any time
she hears rumors or sees critical comments about herself, she calls her mother.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'll call her up, crying. I'll be devastated and she will help me deal,"
Spears said. "It's so weird. Every week, there's something in the tabloids.
She's helped me just say, 'OK, whatever."'
</P>
<P>
	   Spears urged other teen-agers to talk to their parents and turn to them for
help.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't pay attention to what you read or see on TV," she said. "Just go with
what you feel inside. Pay attention to you. You're finding out who you are."

<HEADLINE> Walker Quotes Ellington in Work  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- George Walker, named Monday among this year's inductees
into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame, quotes Duke Ellington -- whom he
will join in the hall -- in his latest composition.
</P>
<P>
	   Walker, 77, said he was immersed in classical music from a young age and
first heard an Ellington tune when he was in college. It was "I Let a Song Go
Out of My Heart," which he quotes in his new composition, "Tangents."
</P>
<P>
	   The piece, for chamber orchestra, was commissioned by the Pro Musica
Orchestra of Columbus, Ohio, which performed the premiere in January. It will be
released on a CD with "Lilacs for Voice and Orchestra," based on the Walt
Whitman poem "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloomed."
</P>
<P>
	   Others to be inducted into the American Classical Music Hall of Fame in
April: pianist Leon Fleisher, soprano Beverly Sills, the Metropolitan Opera,
philanthropist Elizabeth Sprague Coolidge, composer Edward MacDowell, conductors
Eugene Ormandy and George Szell, composer Walter Piston and pianist Rudolf
Serkin.
</P>
<P>
	   Ellington was inducted into the Hall in 1998, its first year.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Deliveries Delayed by Strike  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SEATTLE (AP) -- The Boeing Co. said Monday that delivery of aircraft to
buyers has been delayed by the strike by company engineering and technical
workers that began last week.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's quite obvious that the process has slowed," Boeing spokesman Peter
Conte said. "But we're still striving to maintain operations to the best degree
possible."
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which
represents 22,600 engineers and technical workers at Boeing, went on strike Feb.
9 after federally mediated negotiations over a new contract broke down. There
are no contract offers currently on the table, and no further talks have been
scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   The number of strikers, between 18,000 and 19,000, remained steady last week
and throughout the weekend, according to both sides.
</P>
<P>
	   The first delay came over the weekend, as Boeing confirmed that a 747
jetliner would not be delivered on time to cargo airline Atlas Air Inc. in
Boulder, Colo.
</P>
<P>
	   Conte noted, however, that Boeing contracts require the aerospace giant to
deliver within a certain month, and that airplanes would only be considered
"late" if they missed their month of delivery.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing contracts contain clauses that absolve Boeing from any penalties if
deliveries are late due to work stoppages, he added.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Boeing were down $1.43 3/4 to $38.43 3/4 in afternoon trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Nods Can Turn Into Big Bucks  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Oscar statue is not cast from precious metals, but a
nomination can be box-office gold.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty," "The Insider," "The Cider House Rules," "Being John
Malkovich" and other acclaimed films all stand to benefit financially if they
get a best-picture nomination or other major honors when the Academy Award
nominations come out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even for movies that ultimately lose the best-picture contest, a nomination
can help double the box-office take by the time the awards are handed out.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Oscars are really worth their weight in gold, at least in terms of box
office," said awards show analyst Thomas O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, "Shakespeare in Love" and "Life Is Beautiful" were both
flattening out at the box office when best-picture and other nominations gave
them new life. Miramax, which distributed both movies, expanded them to hundreds
more theaters the weekend after the nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Shakespeare" had grossed $36.2 million before the nominations and doubled
that by late March, when it won best picture and six other Oscars. The movie
ultimately took in $100.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, the gross for "Life Is Beautiful" doubled to $36.4 million between
nominations and awards time. The film eventually topped out at $57.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's Oscar race is wide open, with eight to 10 movies potentially in
the running for five best-picture slots.
</P>
<P>
	   While hits such as "The Sixth Sense" ($278.4 million) and "The Green Mile"
($124.4 million) already have been widely seen, best-picture nominations could
pad their theater and home-video take. Films with solid but unspectacular
numbers such as "The Talented Mr. Ripley" ($78 million) and "The Hurricane" ($42
million) also would benefit from best-picture nominations or honors for stars
Matt Damon and Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Underachieving movies such as "The Insider," with a disappointing $26.7
million, or more narrowly released films such as "Being John Malkovich" ($21
million) and "The Cider House Rules" ($22.7 million) especially could gain
box-office momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nominations really help with movies that have done well with arthouse or
more sophisticated markets but really haven't reached middle America," said
Robert Bucksbaum, a film analyst with Reel Source Inc. "Everybody wants to see
the show. People want to catch the nominees before Oscar night."
</P>
<P>
	   Best-actress nominations for Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry" and Janet
McTeer in "Tumbleweeds" could prove big boosts for the acclaimed but obscure
movies. "Boys" has grossed $3.7 million and "Tumbleweeds" has taken in $1.3
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is one part of our business that's free," said Tom Sherak, head of
distribution for 20th Century Fox, whose Fox Searchlight label released "Boys
Don't Cry." "All this awards stuff is like found awareness, found interest. You
have to be able to capitalize on it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Boys" has been out for five months, but Fox is giving the movie its widest
release yet, about 100 theaters, this Friday to cash in on probable Oscar buzz.
</P>
<P>
	   Oscar alchemy will probably earn "American Beauty," generally viewed as a
lock for a best-picture nomination, millions more on top of the respectable $75
million it already has grossed. DreamWorks, which produced the movie, is
re-releasing "American Beauty" to about 750 theaters three days after the Oscar
nominations come out.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan follows DreamWorks' strategy last year, when it reissued "Saving
Private Ryan" at Oscar time. DreamWorks wrung an additional $26 million out of
the Steven Spielberg film, which had grossed $190 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Oscar nominations do not always mean big bucks. Last year's two other
best-picture nominees, "Elizabeth" and "The Thin Red Line," picked up just $5
million to $6 million between the nominations and awards night. "Elizabeth"
finished with $30 million and "Thin Red Line" $36.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no downside to a nomination, but there's not necessarily an upside
in the case of every movie," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office
tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.

<HEADLINE> NiSource Halts Columbia Energy Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- NiSource Inc. has halted its hostile takeover attempt
of rival energy distributor Columbia Energy Group.
</P>
<P>
	   NiSource announced Monday that it was withdrawing its offer to Columbia
shareholders to buy that company's stock for $74 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Ending the hostile takeover attempt will allow NiSource to negotiate a
buyout of Columbia confidentially and on more friendly terms without tipping off
other interested parties to the share price being discussed, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 58 percent of Columbia shareholders had agreed to sell their stock
to NiSource, a majority that could give NiSource some weight in its
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   NiSource spokeswoman Maria Hibbs declined to say whether her company will
offer more than $74 per share, an amount Columbia executives deemed inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   "NiSource could maintain its current offer or offer more or less," Hibbs
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia officials had fought the NiSource buyout, and said Monday they will
continue to explore the possibility of a merger with NiSource or other
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., sells electricity, natural gas and
water in the Midwest and Northeast. Columbia, based in Herndon, is a leading
natural gas distribution company.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Columbia were trading up 68 3/4 cents at $64.62 1/2, while shares
of NiSource were trading at $17.56 1/4, up 12 1/2 cents on the New York Stock
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Lawmaker Still Holed Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- An outspoken opposition legislator barricaded
himself at the headquarters of his party for a third day Monday to avoid arrest
on libel charges.
</P>
<P>
	   About 200 supporters of Chung Hyung-keun blocked prosecutors from arresting
him as he remained holed up at the head office of the Grand National Party in
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
	   Four prosecutors, carrying an arrest warrant, tried to enter the party
office but were blocked by supporters in the lobby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Stop politically motivated investigations!'' Chung's supporters shouted
through loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
	   The standoff began Friday when prosecutors tried to arrest Chung at his
home. Chung promised to turn himself in the next day but instead hid in the
party office.
</P>
<P>
	   The opposition party's head, Lee Hoi-chang, denounced the prosecutors'
attempt to arrest Chung as a political reprisal ahead of parliamentary elections
April 13.
</P>
<P>
	   The Grand Nationla Party called the National Assembly into session beginning
Tuesday to protect Chung. Prosecutors cannot arrest a legislator while
parliament is in session.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung is known for his criticism of President Kim Dae-jung. He once stirred
controversy by saying at a public rally that the president was employing
``communist-style guerrilla tactics'' to suppress opponents.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past year, he was accused of libel nine times, and he in turn accused
ruling party and government officials of libel 15 times. He has ignored
prosecutors' summonses.
</P>
<P>
	   In his latest anti-government broadside, Chung referred to the president
without his courtesy title and described him as a leftist.
</P>
<P>
	   Chung, a former senior intelligence official under past military
governments, also has been accused of ordering the torture of dissidents and
people suspected of being communist spies in the 1980s. He denies the charges.

<HEADLINE> Efforts Under Way To Start Talks  </HEADLINE>
   By MARK LAVIE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Behind-the-scenes contacts through France apparently are
under way to try to restart Israeli-Syrian peace talks that could end the
guerrilla war in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's Foreign Ministry Director-General Eitan Bentsur was in Paris over
the weekend for talks with French diplomats, a Foreign Ministry official said on
condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
	   The official would not say what the substance of the talks was. But Israel
uses secret talks with France, which has close contacts with Syria and Lebanon,
to deliver messages to both Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
	   Israel's army radio reported that French diplomats passed a message to
Israel indicating that Syria is interested in restarting peace talks, which
fizzled in January after two rounds in the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Foreign Minister David Levy denied that such contacts had taken
place and warned Syria against encouraging Hezbollah guerrilla attacks that have
killed seven Israeli soldiers in just over two weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, Prime Minister Ehud Barak countered criticism that he has been
too soft on the guerrillas by saying that hundreds of thousands of Lebanese
civilians sit in the dark because of airstrikes he ordered against power
stations.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon today, when it gets dark
outside, have no electricity and they will not have proper electricity for
months,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak was hoping Syria, the main power broker in Lebanon, would restrain
Hezbollah guerrillas during peace negotiations, but the violence has escalated
since talks broke off last month.
</P>
<P>
	   While he warned that his military would strike again if military casualties
mount, Barak also appeared to be looking for a balance -- deterring Hezbollah
attacks but keeping the prospects for peace talks with Syria alive.
</P>
<P>
	   Syria wants assurances that Israel would withdraw from the Golan Heights,
captured in 1967, and turn over land extending down to the Sea of Galilee.
Israel refuses preconditions and insists that security issues and normalization
of relations be spelled out first.
</P>
<P>
	   Barak repeated his pledge to pull the Israeli army out of Lebanon by July --
preferably by agreement. But he said that if no agreement is reached with Syria
and Lebanon, he will order a withdrawal anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, in a protest marking Israel's 1981 annexation of the Golan, 200
Druse Arabs threw stones at Israeli police, who responded with tear gas and
rubber bullets.
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators carried large posters of Syrian President Hafez Assad and
urged him to capture Tel Aviv. Two protesters were injured by rubber bullets and
one was overcome by tear gas, Israel Radio said.

<HEADLINE> Soybeans Fall, Grains Mixed  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures finished mixed Monday
on the Chicago Board of Trade, with a lack of fundamental news
keeping volatility low.
</P>
<P>
	   Corn prices rose slightly on concerns that dryness in the
Midwest may persist into growing season. Signs of dry soil at
planting time in the spring could reduce yields.
</P>
<P>
	   But wheat edged lower despite support from dry conditions in the
heart of the winter wheat belt. The price found resistance after
rising early in the session and trading near three-month highs.
</P>
<P>
	   Soybeans also declined, pressured by forecasts for as much as
three inches of rain in the key soybean-growing region of southern
Brazil in the next three days.
</P>
<P>
	   Wheat for March delivery fell  3/4 cent to $2.68 3/4 a bushel; March
corn rose  1/2 cent to $2.22 1/4 a bushel; March oats rose  1/4 cent to
$1.09 1/4 a bushel; March soybeans fell  1/4 cent to $5.05 a bushel.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Cubans Line Up for US Visas  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Hundreds of Cubans lined up outside the U.S. mission in
Havana on Monday to apply for visas under a new system that promises to
eliminate months of waiting for some Cubans.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system took effect Monday. About 700 Cubans -- most of whom meet
visa requirements because they want to visit relatives or take part in cultural
or academic events -- appeared at the U.S. Interests Section to drop off their
passports and pick up application forms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been 40 years since I've seen my brothers and sisters,'' said
Alejandro Martinez, a 50-year-old carpenter standing in the line. As he spoke,
he pulled out a photograph of a man in a hospital bed who he said was his
recently deceased brother.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system was supposed to take effect last month, but was postponed
after U.S. officials said Cuba had backed away from an earlier agreement to
allow the more efficient process. U.S. officials said the dispute was
procedural, not political, and was not related to the custody battle over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez or other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old system, Cubans seeking U.S. tourist visas had to send a letter
to the Interests Section, which then sent them a letter inviting them to apply
for a visa. With that letter, they were allowed to enter the diplomatic
mission's compound to apply. The process could take months.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system lets Cubans come directly to the mission and drop an
application into a box. Officials said most applicants will have an interview
and a reply to their request the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban security forces organized the lines in front of the U.S. mission
Monday. Several people interviewed said they had been showing up for days so as
not to lose their assigned place in line.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Section could
handle only 300 applicants Monday even though more than 700 lined up.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said part of the reason so many Cubans lined up is that they
mistakenly believe it is now easier to get permission from Cuba to visit the
United States. In fact, the requirements for a visa -- mainly proving you have a
stake in Cuba and would not seek to stay in the United States -- have not
changed.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Interests Section, operated by U.S. diplomats under a Swiss flag,
performs most of the functions of an embassy, but the United States and Cuba
have no formal diplomatic relations. Cuba also operates an Interests Section in
Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
	   The Interests Section in Havana has issued about 4,800 visas since the
beginning of October.

<HEADLINE> Entergy To Buy Nuclear Power Plants  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN SAYRE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Entergy Corp. is buying two nuclear power generating
plants owned by the New York Power Authority for $638 million as it continues an
expansion into the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   In July, New Orleans-based Entergy bought the Pilgrim Nuclear Station at
Plymouth, Mass., from Boston Edison for $81 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In the New York deal announced Monday, Entergy is buying the Indian Point 3
plant in Buchanan and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County. Entergy
said it would pay $50 million when the deal is closed and seven annual
installments of about $84 million. In addition, it will pay $168 million over
seven years for fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   The boards of Entergy and the NewYork Power Authority will have to approve
the deal, along with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   NYPA president Eugene W. Zeltmann said the tentative sale would benefit the
authority's power customers since New York is moving towards competition in the
electricity business.
</P>
<P>
	   The power authority will receive all of the electricity generated by Indian
Point 3 and 46 percent of the output from FitzPatrick through 2004. Entergy will
sell the rest on the open market.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy said it would honor existing union contracts at the two plants,
which employ about 1,700. No staff cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy has made the ownership and operation of nuclear plants outside its
traditional Southern territory a major point of its new business strategy, which
also included the recent sales of overseas power distribution companies and
telecommunications and security monitoring services.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Pilgrim station, Entergy operates four nuclear plants,
including Arkansas Nuclear One in Russellville, Ark.; Waterford 3 at Taft, La.;
the River Bend station near St. Francisville, La.; and Grand Gulf Nuclear
Station in Port Gibson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy also is managing the decommissioning of the Maine Yankee plant near
Wiscasset, Maine, and Northeast Utilities' Milestone Unit 1 station near
Waterford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   In trading late Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Entergy was up 43 3/4
cents at $23.56 1/4 a share.

<HEADLINE> EU Lifts Yugoslav Flight Ban  </HEADLINE>
   By PAUL AMES Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- The European Union's foreign ministers suspended a
ban Monday on commercial flights to Yugoslavia, but they simultaneously
tightened travel restrictions on people close to the Yugoslav government.
</P>
<P>
	   The ban on commercial flights from the 15 EU countries into and out of
Yugoslavia was imposed last spring during the Kosovo crisis. The decision to
lift it follows appeals from Yugoslav opposition leaders who say it hits
ordinary citizens more than the ruling elite around President Slobodan
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
	   The ban will be suspended for six months with the possibility of a permanent
lifting afterwards.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is a very important decision because it supports the opposition in
Serbia,'' German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said.
</P>
<P>
	   EU officials said the legal text lifting the ban still had to be made final
and it was unclear when flights would be allowed to resume. It was also unclear
which airlines would fly into Yugoslav points. Several major European carriers
did so before the ban was imposed.
</P>
<P>
	   The United States has backed the proposal to suspend the flight ban, but
said political and economic pressure on Milosevic and prominent government
supporters should be stepped up.
</P>
<P>
	   Even as the EU ministers ended the flight ban, they extended a travel ban on
Milosevic's associates and leading supporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 200 politicians, military and police officers, business leaders and
others were added to an existing list of over 600 Yugoslavs -- including
Milosevic -- who are banned from traveling to the 15 EU nations. The names of
those added to the list were not immediately released.
</P>
<P>
	   The ministers also asked the EU's Executive Commission to close loopholes
that let Milosevic and those close to him avoid a freeze on their international
assets, mostly notably by cash transfers through European banks.
</P>
<P>
	   ``EU banks (should be) made aware of and understand their obligations,'' the
ministers said.
</P>
<P>
	   Also Monday, the EU ministers approved $35 million in aid for Kosovo. But
they warned that further assistance would be ``dependent on progress in
interethnic reconciliation.''
</P>
<P>
	   They also promised to give ``urgent attention'' to appeals for more U.N.
police officers in the province. Some 4,780 police officers were supposed to
patrol the province under the Kosovo peacekeeping plan, but only about 2,000
have arrived.

<HEADLINE> Free Election Elements Seen in Iran  </HEADLINE>
   By BARRY SCHWEID AP Diplomatic Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Iran's legislative elections this week are being held
against a backdrop of a free press and a diversity of views among competing
candidates, the State Department said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly there is a lively political culture that has developed there,''
department spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``Clearly candidates from different
orientations are able to run.''
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. spokesman declined to say, however, what hopes the Clinton
administration might harbor for the outcome.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We obviously don't want to say anything that could affect the election, so
I think it probably would be wise for me not to answer that question,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton administration has long sought to engage Iran in an
unconditional dialogue. But again, on Monday, Rubin said there had been no
response from Tehran.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. agenda for such talks, he said, would include allegations that Iran
fosters terrorism and opposes Arab-Israeli peacemaking as well as the state of
human rights in the Persian Gulf country.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that we want to talk to Iran about these issues doesn't mean that
we believe that they have moderated behavior in these areas,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yet he added: ``Obviously, there has been improvement in terms of the free
press that exists in Iran and the elections that are to be held.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``There have been major developments in that area,'' he said, ``and by
recognizing those we are not suggesting that we don't have problems with other
actions.''
</P>
<P>
	   Specifically, Rubin deplored death sentences imposed on three members of the
Baha'i religion. ``These individuals are being persecuted for the mere practice
of their faith,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   They were arrested in 1997 for violating a government ban on the practice of
their religion and have been in prison for two years.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We urge that the government of Iran protect members of the Baha'i faith
and that it ease restrictions on the practice of religion so that all Iranians
might enjoy the fundamental human right to freedom of conscience and belief,''
Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
	   In a statement Friday, President Clinton said he was deeply troubled that
the death sentences had been reaffirmed for Sirus Zabihi-Moghaddam and Hadayet
Kashefi-Najafabadi and the same sentence imposed on Manucher Khulusi.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Executing people for their religious faith is contrary to the most
fundamental human rights principles,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The statement said Clinton holds the Iranian government responsible for the
safety of the Baha'is of Iran and strongly urged that the executions not be
carried out.

<HEADLINE> Supermarket Grand Union Fires CEO  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WAYNE, N.J. (AP) -- Grand Union Co. fired its chief executive officer today
and the chief administrative officer of the financially struggling supermarket
chain resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   CEO J. Wayne Harris was also removed from his position as chairman of the
board and removed from the board. Jack W. Partridge Jr., who was serving as vice
chairman, stepped down from the board as resigning his position as chief
administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary M. Philbin, the company's president since 1997, was elected CEO to
replace Harris, while director Stephen M. Peck has become chairman of the board.
Jeffrey P. Freimark, the company's executive vice president and chief financial
officer, will succeed Partridge.
</P>
<P>
	   Philbin said the company plans to follow through with plans to remodel
stores and open new ones to control its expenses better.
</P>
<P>
	   Grand Union, which reported a $35.6 million loss last quarter and has filed
for bankruptcy protection twice in five years, changed its board after a demand
from its largest shareholder in December to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swiss bank UBS AG moved in court papers in December to change the board
dramatically to bring about a sale of the 217-store chain with stores in New
Jersey, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. The bank
later withdrew its proposal.

<HEADLINE> Blacks, Glaucoma Surgery Studied  </HEADLINE>
    By LINDSEY TANNER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- A study of Medicare claims found that blacks were only half
as likely as whites to undergo surgery for glaucoma, the most common cause of
blindness in black Americans.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers, whose study appears in the February issue of Archives of
Ophthalmology, said the reasons could include lack of health-care access,
inadequate education about the disease, overtreatment of whites and racial bias.
</P>
<P>
	   An estimated 3 million Americans have glaucoma, the nation's second-leading
cause of irreversible vision loss. The researchers noted that more than $1
billion is spent on federal aid yearly to about 120,000 blind glaucoma patients.
</P>
<P>
	   Glaucoma is characterized by a buildup of pressure within the eyeball.
Excessive pressure may damage the optic nerve. The most common form usually
occurs after age 40. Treatment typically begins with medication, followed by
surgery -- either conventional or with lasers -- if that fails.
</P>
<P>
	   The disease is at least four times more prevalent in black Americans than in
whites, but the current study and others suggest blacks are undertreated.
</P>
<P>
	   The researchers, led by Dr. Uday Devgan, a UCLA ophthalmologist, analyzed
Medicare claims for both types of glaucoma surgery for 30,495 blacks and 160,792
whites between 1991 and 1994. Patients were at least 65 years old.
</P>
<P>
	   Taking into account the prevalence of glaucoma in patients of both races,
the researchers determined that the rate of surgery for blacks was nearly half
that of whites and 47 percent below what would have been expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Previous researchers found a racial gap in glaucoma surgery when examining
Medicare records from the late 1980s through 1991. Though Devgan and colleagues
said the gap appeared to be narrowing in the mid-1990s, they said the
disparities still were troubling.
</P>
<P>
	   "A major change in the public health policies in the United States may be
needed if we hope to see a further narrowing of the gap," they said.
</P>
<P>
	   Racial disparities also have been found in connection with heart disease
treatments and knee and hip replacements.
</P>
<P>
	   Dr. Richard Mills, a University of Kentucky ophthalmologist involved in
national glaucoma research, said cultural factors may play a role.
</P>
<P>
	   "Black patients tend to be less willing to agree to surgery when recommended
than do Caucasians," Mills said. "We're still looking at disparities for which
we don't have complete explanations."

<HEADLINE> Nationalists Might Lose in Taiwan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   An AP News Analysis
By WILLIAM FOREMAN Associated Press Writer
</P>
<P>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- Many Taiwanese believe their island is weeks away
from a historic event: the Nationalist Party's loss of the presidency for the
first time in more than 50 years.
</P>
<P>
	   But the party might retain power even if its candidate -- who has been
lagging in the polls the entire campaign -- loses the tight three-way race next
month to popular independent James Soong.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the Nationalists recently expelled Soong and have spent millions on
vicious attack ads painting him as a power-hungry politician who embezzled party
funds, they could chose to make up with him if he moves into the presidential
mansion.
</P>
<P>
	   Such a flip-flop wouldn't be unexpected from the Nationalists, who have a
reputation for being willing to do nearly anything to stay in power. Embracing
Soong might also prove preferable to enduring the humiliation of being forced
into the opposition for the first time in five decades.
</P>
<P>
	   And Soong himself might welcome an invitation to return to the fold. Until
recently, he was one of the party's superstars. He claims to still have a strong
following within the party, which he says has been hijacked by a small clique
that doesn't represent the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Soong, Chin Jin-sheng, won't rule out the possibility of the
candidate becoming a Nationalist again. But Chin said the campaign hasn't
thought much about it and is only focusing on winning the March 18 election.
</P>
<P>
	   If Soong becomes president, he would likely find it hard to resist the
allure of the party's vast resources and legislative majority. Governing
Taiwan's young democracy -- the island's first direct presidential election was
in 1996 -- could be difficult for an independent lacking the brain trust and
funding offered by the Nationalists, one of the world's richest parties.
</P>
<P>
	   The party ousted Soong in November because he challenged the official
Nationalist candidate, Vice President Lien Chan -- a stiff ex-political science
professor from a wealthy family who has struggled to inspire ordinary voters.
</P>
<P>
	   Soong has created an image just the opposite. As a former Taiwan provincial
governor -- a job that was eliminated in a government downsizing drive -- he
built a reputation as a can-do leader who constantly toured remote towns
forgotten by other politicians, listened to the people and delivered on his
promises.
</P>
<P>
	   If the Nationalists welcomed Soong back into their ranks, it would be a
cruel stab in the heart of the retiring 77-year-old President Lee Teng-hui,
Soong's former mentor and now his most fierce critic. Lee has said he could
tolerate anyone but Soong as president.
</P>
<P>
	   Although several polls show Soong leading, there's still plenty of time left
to lose the election. Many believe the Nationalists will use their vast campaign
war chest and local political connections to buy votes, especially in rural
areas where the practice is common.
</P>
<P>
	   Soong has also been dogged by allegations he transferred large sums of party
funds into his family accounts -- accusations he has repeatedly denied. The
party could be waiting until the final weeks of the campaign to unleash other
accusations.
</P>
<P>
	   Another threat is Chen Shui-bian, running for the main opposition Democratic
Progressive Party. Some polls say the former Taipei mayor is in first place, and
he could benefit from Soong splitting the Nationalist vote.

<HEADLINE> NATO Warns Ethnic Albanians  </HEADLINE>
   By ELENA BECATOROS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KOSOVSKA MITROVICA, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Attacks by ethnic Albanians on the
peacekeepers sent to Kosovo to protect them could undermine support for the
peacekeeping mission, NATO's chief said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   NATO Secretary-General Lord George Robertson condemned Sunday's attack by
Albanian snipers that wounded two French soldiers and said the alliance would
not tolerate further violence against its troops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I would remind all parties in Kosovo that it was NATO that put an end to
organized ethnic cleansing and has worked to restore peace and stability for all
ethnic groups in the province,'' Robertson said in Brussels, Belgium.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 50,000 peacekeepers were sent to Kosovo after last year's 78-day
Western bombing campaign forced Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to halt a
crackdown on ethnic Albanians. Some 10,000 ethnic Albanians were killed and
900,000 were forced to flee their homes.
</P>
<P>
	   However, the peacekeeping mission has shifted over the last eight months
from facilitating the return of refugees to protecting Serbs and Gypsies from
reprisal attacks by ethnic Albanians.
</P>
<P>
	   The ethnically divided city of Kosovska Mitrovica has been the center of
much of the recent turmoil. Kosovo's most multiethnic city has been wracked by
violence since a Feb. 2 grenade attack on a U.N. bus killed two elderly Serbs.
</P>
<P>
	   The city appeared calm Monday, a day after fighting erupted between French
soldiers and snipers. French and Belgian troops sealed off an ethnic Albanian
enclave in the Serb part of town and searched house-to-house for weapons and
snipers.
</P>
<P>
	   About 6,000 ethnic Albanians demonstrated peacefully Monday in Lipljan,
about 25 miles southeast of Kosovska Mitrovica, to protest violence in the
province.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, about 3,000 ethnic Albanians turned out Monday for the funeral of
a former Kosovo Liberation Army fighter, Avni Haredini, who mourners said was
killed Sunday by French troops. Speaking at the funeral, Halit Barani, head of
the ethnic Albanian Human Rights Council, accused the French of being ``the same
as the Serb soldiers.''
</P>
<P>
	   The chief U.N. administrator, Bernard Kouchner, renewed his appeal for more
U.N. police to prevent the province from exploding.
</P>
<P>
	   ``KFOR soldiers have been formidable, particularly the French,'' said
Kouchner, a former French Cabinet minister. ``But it is not their job to do
police work.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States condemned the latest violence, blaming both ethnic
Albanians and Serbs for the incidents in Kosovska Mitrovica.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly more needs to be done to restore stability under these
exceptionally dangerous and challenging circumstances,'' State Department
spokesman James Rubin said.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Crash Victims Mourned  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEXANDRA ZAVIS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- Friends and relatives tossed red roses into the
sea Monday in a tearful tribute to the 169 people who died when a Kenya Airways
jet smashed into the Atlantic Ocean.
</P>
<P>
	   The mourners traveled to the crash site, about two miles offshore, in a
privately-owned ship. Some embraced, while others bowed their heads in silent
prayer.
</P>
<P>
	   There was a brief interfaith ceremony, and Ivory Coast's first lady, Rose
Guei, placed a wreath in the water from a separate boat.
</P>
<P>
	   For many mourners, there was little hope of being able to give their loved
ones a funeral. With 49 people still missing from the Jan. 30 crash, Kenya
Airways has ended the search for bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is too much,'' said Silvester Maloba Ongoro, a Kenyan whose brother
has not been recovered from the wreckage. ``I must see my brother, I must bury
him to believe he is dead.''
</P>
<P>
	   Airline officials, however, say it is becoming too risky for the divers. One
Kenyan military diver died while searching the wreckage, which is about 200 feet
under water.
</P>
<P>
	   When the search was called off Sunday night, 119 bodies had been recovered.
But an additional corpse was spotted floating in the ocean by one of the boats
participating in Monday's ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   A speed boat was sent out to retrieve the body of the man, a Kenya Airways
crew member. By the time the mourners returned to shore, the body was in a body
bag at the dock.
</P>
<P>
	   Flight 431 crashed moments after it took off from Abidjan's seaside airport,
killing all but 10 of the 179 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The salvage effort has progressed slowly, with Ivorian authorities at first
relying largely on unpaid amateurs from an Abidjan diving club. Later,
professional divers were brought in.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenya Airways has been paying for much of the search.
</P>
<P>
	   While the plane's flight data recorder has been recovered, the cockpit voice
recorder has not been found.

    NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks led the market today, bounding higher as
investors sought bargains in the wake of Friday's sharp selloff. Technology
stocks shook off some early weakness to finish mostly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Dow Jones industrial average was
up 94.63 at 10,519.84.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher, although their gains were more
moderate.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow recovered some ground following its worst week since October. The
index fell 538.59, including a 218.42-point drop Friday that knocked the index
11 percent below its January peak.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks have been rattled in recent weeks by investors' worries that most
companies will struggle to maintain strong profit growth if the Federal Reserve
continues raising interest rates this year. Technology companies, which are
growing faster than industrial and cyclical companies, have held up much better
than the broader market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's gains today marked the first time since Jan. 31 that the blue-chip
index has outperformed the technology-dominated Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Dow's doing better because cyclical stocks have been just the worst
place to be for the past couple of weeks," said Thomas M. McManus, equity
portfolio strategist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in New York. "It seems
like an oversold bounce, though, and I think it's too early to get bullish about
the Dow."
</P>
<P>
	   Cyclical stocks are those that depend on the underlying strength of the
economy for profit growth. Today, Alcoa and United Technologies led the Dow's
advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Exxon Mobil rose as the price of crude oil reached $30 per barrel for
the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991. U.S. crude oil inventories
are nearing the lowest levels in more than two decades. That's good news for oil
companies, but analysts cautioned that it could lead to inflation if prices
spiral sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, software maker Medical Manager Corp. soared after agreeing to
be acquired by Healtheon/WebMD, a provider of health care information.
</P>
<P>
	   NetOptix rose on the news that it will be acquired by Corning for $149.18
per share, or about $2 billion in stock. NetOptix makes filters used in
fiber-optic technology.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were some signs of profit-taking among high-tech leaders,
including Qualcomm and Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts were heartened by the Dow's recovery today, most believe the
long-term trend toward technology stocks won't change any time soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stock selection should be focused on those companies with strong earnings
momentum, which would be mainly technology stocks," said John H. Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   McManus suggested that investors should take a second look at some
long-neglected stocks in the financial services, utility and health care
sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market's current fascination with tech has gone just a bit too far," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks received some additional support today from Abby Joseph Cohen, chief
market strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. Cohen, one of Wall Street's most
consistently bullish analysts, reiterated her expectation that the S&AMP;P 500 will
reach 1,525 by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In her comments to the firm's sales force, Cohen also said profit growth and
economic expansion remain strong, providing a solid base for stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
	   According to preliminary calculations, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.85
to 1,389.97, and the Nasdaq composite index rose 23.12 to 4,418.57.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange, with 1,554 down, 1,473 up and 504 unchanged.
</P>
<P>
	   NYSE volume totaled 923.64 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs. 1.02 billion in
the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 0.69 to 537.79.

<HEADLINE> Maytag Shares Tumble  </HEADLINE>
    By MELANIE S. WELTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag Corp. shares tumbled more than 10 percent
Monday after the appliance maker warned of weaker earnings due to expected flat
sales in its home appliances, increased competition in floor care products and
decreased sales of vending machines.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag said its earnings per share could be off 10 percent or more from
1999's record first-quarter performance of 95 cents a share. Analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial were projecting earnings of 96 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   In trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Maytag shares were down $3.87 1/2
to $32.50.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most people were assuming the results would be about the same as last year.
It now appears they're going to be lower than last year. So I guess that's
surprising," said Russell Leavitt, an analyst with Bank of America Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's report follows strong sales in Maytag's fourth quarter of 1999,
which were up 7.7 percent from the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had said previously that our (earnings per share) growth would be slower
in the first half, while accelerating through the second half of 2000; that
continues to be our view," Maytag chairman and chief executive Lloyd D. Ward
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag said it expects its Dixie-Narco vending equipment sales to major soft
drink bottlers will be off significantly in its first quarter and that decline
will not likely be offset by home appliance sales, which are expected to be
little different from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag also said it expects competitive pressures from new bagless upright
vacuums will continue to dampen growth of sales of its Hoover products. Hoover
will introduce its own advances in bagless upright vacuums in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag expects growth will accelerate through the second half of the year,
with earnings per share increasing in the range of 15 to 20 percent year over
year, Ward said. The company will be helped by product introductions in floor
care, cooking, dishwashing, foodservice, and refrigeration, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag also announced an alliance with Sanyo Electric Co. to develop and
market home appliance products for the Japanese and Pacific Rim markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanyo is one of the world's leading appliance manufacturers with a leading
position in the home and commercial laundry market in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement with Maytag involves major appliances and floor care products,
with an initial focus on laundry, new cooking technologies and floor and fabric
care products.

</P>
<P>
	   The company said it expects first-quarter profits to come in at least 10
percent below last year's first-quarter earnings of 95 cents per share. Maytag
said investments in Internet-related initiatives are partly to blame for the
slower-than-expected growth.
</P>

<HEADLINE> AmeriServe Names New President  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DALLAS (AP) -- AmeriServe Food Distribution Inc., operating under bankruptcy
protection from creditors, has tapped a railroad and trucking executive as its
new president.
</P>
<P>
	   Ronald A. Rittenmeyer, 52, was chairman, president and chief executive at
RailTex Inc. until it merged this month with RailAmerica Inc. to create the
world's largest shortline railroad.
</P>
<P>
	   Rittenmeyer will replace John V. Holten, who will remain as chairman,
AmeriServe said Monday. Holten built the company through a series of
acquisitions in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   AmeriServe, one of the nation's largest food distributors, filed for Chapter
11 bankruptcy protection Jan. 31. Earlier this month, a judge approved a
six-month, $150 million line of credit from two of its largest customers --
Burger King Corp. and Tricon Global Restaurants Inc., which owns Pizza Hut, KFC
and Taco Bell -- to keep the company running.
</P>
<P>
	   The company is privately held and has not disclosed its current assets and
liabilities. Analysts say AmeriServe could not handle two large acquisitions it
made in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Before RailTex, Rittenmeyer was president and chief operating officer of
Ryder TRS Inc., a large truck-rental company. He has also been a principal in a
corporate-turnaround consulting firm, president of a computer and software
distribution company and a vice president at snack food giant Frito-Lay
Co.

<HEADLINE> Europe Wary on Cyanide Spill Damage  </HEADLINE>
   By ALEX BANDY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- A cyanide spill that polluted two European rivers
will ``poison the whole food chain'' for years to come, a Hungarian
environmental official said today.
</P>
<P>
	   Zoltan Illes, the head of Hungary's environmental committee in parliament,
repeated assertions that the spill that contaminated the Danube and Tisza rivers
represents ``the biggest environmental catastrophe since Chernobyl,'' the
world's worst nuclear accident.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that heavy metals also got into the rivers means an even worse
problem'' than the cyanide, he said in a television interview. ``It will poison
the whole food chain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Illes spoke a day after the cyanide spill reached Yugoslavia's stretch of
the Danube, leaving dead fish in its wake. Even as the poison diminished to
non-lethal levels, Serbian officials said they would sue those responsible in an
international court.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union Commission said today it was ready to help Hungary and
Romania deal with the cyanide spill and will send its top environment official
to assess the damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The spill originated in northwestern Romania, where a dam at the Baia Mare
gold mine overflowed Jan. 30, causing cyanide to pour into streams. A cyanide
solution is used to separate gold ore from surrounding rock.
</P>
<P>
	   The polluted water flowed west into Hungary and then to Yugoslavia, a
federation made up of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
	   Witnesses said parts of the Danube were ``all white with the bellies of dead
fish,'' the Beta news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The poison destroyed virtually all aquatic life in the Tisza River before
entering the Danube, Serbian officials said. The Tisza is one of the country's
major rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tisza River ``has been killed. Not even bacteria have survived,''
Serbian Environment Minister Bratislav Blazic told The Associated Press as he
toured the affected area. Local volunteers were collecting dead fish for burial
in efforts to isolate some of the lethal substance.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimation of the damage and ... that the culprits for
this tragedy be punished,'' Blazic said.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary's environment minister, Pal Pepo, visited the Baia Mare mine. He was
joined by Anton Vlad, Romania's deputy environment minister.
</P>
<P>
	   Pepo again asked for compensation for damage to Hungarian waters and
wildlife. Romania is waiting for experts from both countries to assess the
damage, Vlad said, according to the national news agency Rompres.
</P>
<P>
	   In Perth, Australia, the gold mining company being blamed for the pollution,
Esmeralda Exploration Ltd., said today that reports that the overflow was
affecting waters in Yugoslavia ``defied scientific logic.''
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for Esmeralda said the company, which owns half of the Baia Mare
mine, stood by its comments that ``the facts coming out of Hungary are grossly
exaggerated.'' He said Esmeralda had ``its own team of environmental
consultants'' in Europe assessing the situation.
</P>
<P>
	   After the waste entered the Danube on Sunday afternoon, the concentration of
cyanide dropped below lethal levels, Serbian officials said. Experts said there
was no threat to Belgrade, and the Serbian Agricultural Ministry claimed all
traces of toxins would disappear by Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   But earlier measurements showed cyanide levels 20 times higher than an
acceptable maximum. Predrag Prolic, head of the Chemistry and Toxicology faculty
at Belgrade University, said it had ``destroyed life in the Tisza for years to
come.''
</P>
<P>
	   And although the cyanide levels were decreasing, the effects were still
visible today. Scattered groups of up to a dozen dead fish floated down the
Danube, reaching the Serbian capital by midday.
</P>
<P>
	   Beta said that at Vinca, further downstream, water pumps were shot off as a
precaution and trucks were planning to deliver drinking water to the suburb.
</P>
<P>
	   Prolic said that beside aquatic life, birds feeding off fish and wildlife
are also at risk and the poisoned water can filter into the soil, grass, grain
and livestock.
</P>
<P>
	   The fertile plains of Serbia's north are the country's breadbasket. Water
from the Tisza is traditionally used for irrigation.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Plan May Strain Fund  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan by brokerage titan Merrill Lynch to switch some
customers' money into insured bank accounts could lead to a sudden surge in
insured deposits that may strain the federal insurance fund, an FDIC senior
policy analyst warned officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses. But the
move by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which could be emulated by other financial
companies as the line between banking and brokerage blurs, has raised concern
among regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the plan could pump as much as $100 billion into insured bank
accounts without a corresponding increase in insurance premiums paid by banks to
replenish the federal fund, according to a memo by FDIC senior policy analyst
James McFadyen to the director of the agency's research division.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, the FDIC's chairwoman, is expected to raise the issue
Wednesday at a House Banking subcommittee hearing on the bank insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on FDIC material. This
is an industry(-wide) question," said Joe Cohen, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch
at its New York headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan by the world's biggest brokerage firm, announced two weeks ago, is
part of the transformation of the nation's financial landscape brought by
legislation enacted last November allowing banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage firms are offering more banking services, such as home mortgages,
estate planning and federally insured savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy by Merrill involves a new version of its 25-year-old Cash
Management Accounts, which combine interest-bearing checking -- not currently
federally insured -- and a credit card with a brokerage account holding stocks
and bonds. Customers must have $20,000 to open such an account.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in June, Merrill plans to offer customers an option that will
automatically "sweep" the cash now in money-market funds in the Cash Management
Accounts into FDIC-insured savings accounts in its two bank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the Merrill Lynch example, an increase in insured deposits of $100
billion would cause" the reserve ratio -- or the balance of the insurance fund
divided by insured deposits -- from around 1.38 percent to 1.32 percent,
McFadyen, the FDIC policy analyst, said in the memo. A copy was obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Merrill's bank affiliates have the best risk rating, they are not
required to pay FDIC insurance premiums, McFadyen noted in the memo Monday to
William R. Watson, director of the agency's research and statistics division,
and Barry Kolatch, its deputy director.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, barring the unlikely event that the banks' ratings were
downgraded, McFadyen wrote, "no (insurance) fund growth would result from the
insured-deposit growth attributable to the Merrill program."
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted that major brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. manages more than
$100 billion in cash management accounts and other money-market funds. The
possibility that Merrill, Schwab and other financial companies could suddenly
switch large amounts of money into FDIC-insured accounts "raises questions for
the federal deposit insurance system regarding the adequacy of the (insurance)
funds," McFadyen wrote.

    WAYNE, N.J. (AP) -- Grand Union Co. fired its chief executive officer Monday
and the chief administrative officer of the financially struggling supermarket
chain resigned.
</P>
<P>
	   CEO J. Wayne Harris was also removed from his position as chairman of the
board and removed from the board. Jack W. Partridge Jr., who was serving as vice
chairman, stepped down from the board as resigning his position as chief
administrative officer.
</P>
<P>
	   Gary M. Philbin, the company's president since 1997, was elected CEO to

</P>
<P>
	   Philbin said the company plans to follow through with plans to remodel
stores and open new ones to control its expenses better.
</P>
<P>
	   Grand Union, which reported a $35.6 million loss last quarter and has filed
for bankruptcy protection twice in five years, changed its board after a demand
from its largest shareholder in December to do so.
</P>
<P>
	   The Swiss bank UBS AG moved in court papers in December to change the board
dramatically to bring about a sale of the 217-store chain with stores in New
Jersey, Connecticut, New Hampshire, New York, Pennsylvania and Vermont. The bank
later withdrew its proposal.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Reminds Hispanics of Record  </HEADLINE>
   By ANNE GEARAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hispanics have flourished under the Clinton-Gore
administration, but Republicans have deliberately delayed nominations of three
Hispanics for the federal bench, President Clinton told Hispanic leaders Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We have worked for seven years ... for a society in which there is
opportunity for all and responsibility from all, and a community of all
Americans, and it is working,'' Clinton said as he accepted an award from the
League of United Latin American Citizens.
</P>
<P>
	   He listed accomplishments, for which he said Vice President Al Gore deserves
credit as well, including the lowest Hispanic unemployment rate in history, a
20-year low in the poverty rate and the lowest welfare enrollment in a
generation.
</P>
<P>
	   Hispanics comprise the fastest-growing population group in the United
States, and their voting pattern traditionally has leaned toward the Democrats.
In the last two presidential elections, Hispanics voted overwhelmingly for
Clinton and Gore -- 72 percent to 21 percent in 1996 and 61 percent to 25
percent in 1992.
</P>
<P>
	   As he promotes Gore's presidential candidacy, the president is uneasy about
Republican presidential front-runner George W. Bush's proven ability to draw a
majority of Hispanic votes in Texas, administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   He did not mention the Texas governor Monday, but Clinton took a swipe at
Senate Republicans over what he said is a concerted effort to deny a fair
hearing to his Hispanic judicial nominees.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Some people don't want these folks on the court,'' Clinton said. ``But
they don't want you to know they don't want them on the court, because then you
might not want them in the Senate.''
</P>
<P>
	   As the crowd murmured, Clinton added: ``This is not rocket science. This is
what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also appealed for broader Hispanic participation in this year's
Census and said the information on Census forms will never be shared with
landlords, government officials or the Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
	   The administration estimates 8.4 million people were not counted in the last
census, many of them minorities and children.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If we believe everybody in our American community counts, we've got to
make sure everyone is counted,'' Clinton said as he promoted a nationwide effort
to distribute information about the head count in schools.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said three major league baseball players -- Ivan Rodriguez of the
Texas Rangers, Barry Bonds of the San Francisco Giants and Derek Jeter of the
New York Yankees -- will appear in public service ads to make the point that
census information is confidential.

<HEADLINE> Cubans Line Up for US Visas  </HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN GUTKIN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HAVANA (AP) -- Hundreds of Cubans lined up outside the U.S. mission in
Havana on Monday to apply for visas under a new system that promises to
eliminate months of waiting for some Cubans.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system took effect Monday. About 700 Cubans -- most of whom meet
visa requirements because they want to visit relatives or take part in cultural
or academic events -- appeared at the U.S. Interests Section to drop off their
passports and pick up application forms.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's been 40 years since I've seen my brothers and sisters,'' said
Alejandro Martinez, a 50-year-old carpenter standing in the line. As he spoke,
he pulled out a photograph of a man in a hospital bed who he said was his
recently deceased brother.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system was supposed to take effect last month, but was postponed
after U.S. officials said Cuba had backed away from an earlier agreement to
allow the more efficient process. U.S. officials said the dispute was
procedural, not political, and was not related to the custody battle over
6-year-old Elian Gonzalez or other issues.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the old system, Cubans seeking U.S. tourist visas had to send a letter
to the Interests Section, which then sent them a letter inviting them to apply
for a visa. With that letter, they were allowed to enter the diplomatic
mission's compound to apply. The process could take months.
</P>
<P>
	   The new system lets Cubans come directly to the mission, drop off their
passports and pick up an application. Officials said most applicants will have
an interview and a reply to their request the next day.
</P>
<P>
	   Cuban security forces organized the lines in front of the U.S. mission
Monday. Several people interviewed said they had been showing up for days so as
not to lose their assigned place in line.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Section could
handle only 300 applicants Monday even though more than 700 lined up.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. officials said part of the reason so many Cubans lined up is that they
mistakenly believe the United States has relaxed visa requirements. In fact, the
requirements for a visa -- mainly proving you have a stake in Cuba and would not
seek to stay in the United States -- have not changed.

<HEADLINE> Peapod Obtains $120M in Financing  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHICAGO (AP) -- Online grocer Peapod Inc. has obtained an additional $120
million in financing to back its nationwide quest for more customers.
</P>
<P>
	   The move should allow Skokie, Ill.-based Peapod to keep its hold on the No.
1 spot in a fledgling industry and press ahead with expansion plans that would
have fizzled this year without a major influx of cash.
</P>
<P>
	   But Wall Street apparently remains concerned about the stiffening online
grocer competition and the terms of the financing, which had been rumored for
days. Peapod shares were down $1.12 1/2 at $9.87 1/2 a share Monday on the New
York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, which currently serves 100,000 customers across the country,
said it will use the money to expand its existing presence in eight major U.S.
metropolitan areas and to develop new markets.
</P>
<P>
	   "This removes major uncertainty with regard to their future," Barry
Stouffer, an analyst for J.C. Bardford &AMP; Co. in Nashville, Tenn., said of the
financing.
</P>
<P>
	   "But nobody's operating yet at a scale that proves that the business model
works. You need a much higher level of sales to make it work," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Peapod recorded $69.2 million in sales in fiscal 1998, the most recent year
for which full annual figures are available. Third-quarter 1999 sales were $16.5
million.
</P>
<P>
	   Letters of intent were signed by Apollo Management, The Yucaipa Companies,
Pequot Capital Management and GRP II, which are to purchase a total of $120
million of convertible preferred stock of Peapod, the company said.
</P>
<P>
	   It now delivers groceries from online orders in Boston; Chicago; Columbus,
Ohio; Dallas, Houston and Austin, Texas; Long Island, N.Y., and San
Francisco-San Jose.
</P>
<P>
	   The company, with a decade's experience in the business, had been building
slowly. But a raft of new competitors, all founded in the past two years, put it
under increasing pressure to branch out. Several of them, flush with cash from
venture capitalists or from going public, also are poised for nationwide growth.
</P>
<P>
	   The biggest include Kirkland, Wash.-based HomeGrocer.com and Foster City,
Calif.-based Webvan Group Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   So far, only about 1 percent of sales in the $450 billion-a-year supermarket
industry comes from online sales, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's a tiny industry at this point in terms of revenues," said Stouffer.
"But it's got tremendous potential, not just within this category but within
other categories as well," he said, citing the huge markets for pre-made meals
and beauty aid goods.

<HEADLINE> 86 Protesters Arrested Over Iraq  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police arrested 86 people in front of the U.S. Mission to
the United Nations on Monday after they refused to move during a demonstration
to protest U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wake up the children are dying,'' the protesters chanted as they held up
pictures of emaciated Iraqi children and placards reading ``Lift the
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct, said police officer
Valerie St. Rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally came on the same day U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan accepted
the resignation of the world body's humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Hans von
Sponeck. Von Sponeck has been a severe critic of sanctions and the U.N. relief
program for Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil, its most precious commodity, on the
open market since U.N. sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq has rid itself
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council created the oil-for-food program in 1996 to enable
Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other essential
goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, however, has been unable to meet all of the Iraqis' needs, and
U.N. reports consistently speak of high malnutrition rates among Iraqis,
particularly the children.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's rally marked the 10th anniversary of a Persian Gulf War bombing
that Iraq said killed more than 300 civilians. Baghdad has maintained the
building was a civilian shelter, but U.S. officials said they targeted the
structure because it was a military command center.

<HEADLINE> Letterman To Return Feb. 21  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID BAUDER AP Television Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- David Letterman is returning to television after heart
surgery on Feb. 21 initially as a part-timer, mixing in his own appearances with
guest hosts as he continues to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   His first "Late Show" guest will be Regis Philbin, Letterman's on-air
conversation partner when he revealed his medical problems. He underwent an
emergency quintuple bypass operation on Jan. 14 after a test revealed a blocked
artery.
</P>
<P>
	   "I imagine Dave, as usual, will have a lot to say," executive producer Rob
Burnett said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman will tape his first show on Friday, then work once more next week,
on Feb. 23. Bill Cosby will be a guest host of CBS' "Late Show" on Feb. 22, and
Philbin will fill in for Letterman on Feb. 24.
</P>
<P>
	   Some subsequent weeks will also likely be a combination of Letterman and
guest hosts, Burnett said. That's a first for Letterman, who hasn't used guest
hosts since he began in late-night television for NBC in 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   "As early as two weeks ago, I think he was ready and raring to go," Burnett
said. "Dave, I think, got a rare opportunity to experience what it would be like
not to do this ... The experience has absolutely made him miss the job
completely."
</P>
<P>
	   Letterman's return is likely to draw a big audience and the timing, in the
midst of a ratings sweeps month, couldn't be better for CBS. His ratings have
been up this season and late-night competitor Jay Leno is down, but Leno's
average audience each night on NBC is still 35 percent bigger.
</P>
<P>
	   "I still don't think he's going to beat the 'Tonight' show regularly, but he
will get a boost," said Marc Berman, a television analyst for Mediaweek.com.
</P>
<P>
	   Last week, when a series of celebrities were interviewed reminiscing about
their appearances with Letterman for "Late Show Backstage" specials, it was the
third highest-rated week of the year for "Late Show."
</P>
<P>
	   "Backstage" continues this week with Kathie Lee Gifford, Robin Williams and
Mike Myers among the guests. Tom Snyder comes out of retirement Wednesday to
interview Don Rickles and Norm McDonald.
</P>
<P>
	   Burnett said he hadn't talked with Letterman about ways to cut back his
workload. One possibility is working four shows a week with one guest host, as
Johnny Carson did on his later years on the "Tonight" show.
</P>
<P>
	   "I think Dave will ultimately be able to do five nights a week again," he
said. "It's just a question of whether he wants to do it."
</P>
<P>
	   Burnett said there was "no shortage of volunteers" to be Letterman's guest
on the first show back, but that Philbin seemed to make the most sense.
Letterman disclosed his heart problems after asking Philbin about his own
successful emergency angioplasty in 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "He's a friend and he's tied to this experience for us," Burnett said.

<HEADLINE> Entergy To Buy Nuclear Power Plants  </HEADLINE>
    By ALAN SAYRE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) -- Entergy Corp. is buying two nuclear power generating
plants owned by the New York Power Authority for $638 million as it continues an
expansion into the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
	   In July, New Orleans-based Entergy bought the Pilgrim Nuclear Station at
Plymouth, Mass., from Boston Edison for $81 million.
</P>
<P>
	   In the New York deal announced Monday, Entergy is buying the Indian Point 3
plant in Buchanan and the James A. FitzPatrick plant in Oswego County. Entergy
said it would pay $50 million when the deal is closed and seven annual
installments of about $84 million. In addition, it will pay $168 million over
seven years for fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   The boards of Entergy and the NewYork Power Authority will have to approve
the deal, along with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
</P>
<P>
	   NYPA president Eugene W. Zeltmann said the tentative sale would benefit the
authority's power customers since New York is moving towards competition in the
electricity business.
</P>
<P>
	   The power authority will receive all of the electricity generated by Indian
Point 3 and 46 percent of the output from FitzPatrick through 2004. Entergy will
sell the rest on the open market.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy said it would honor existing union contracts at the two plants,
which employ about 1,700. No staff cuts are expected.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy has made the ownership and operation of nuclear plants outside its
traditional Southern territory a major point of its new business strategy, which
also included the recent sales of overseas power distribution companies and
telecommunications and security monitoring services.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to the Pilgrim station, Entergy operates four nuclear plants,
including Arkansas Nuclear One in Russellville, Ark.; Waterford 3 at Taft, La.;
the River Bend station near St. Francisville, La.; and Grand Gulf Nuclear
Station in Port Gibson, Miss.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy also is managing the decommissioning of the Maine Yankee plant near
Wiscasset, Maine, and Northeast Utilities' Milestone Unit 1 station near
Waterford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	   In trading Monday, shares of the New York Stock Exchange-listed Entergy were
up 37 1/2 cents at $23.50 as of 4:30 p.m. EST.

<HEADLINE> Maytag Shares Tumble  </HEADLINE>
    By MELANIE S. WELTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) -- Maytag Corp. shares tumbled more than 10 percent
Monday after the appliance maker warned of weaker earnings due to expected flat
sales in its home appliances, increased competition in floor care products and
decreased sales of vending machines.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag said its earnings per share could be off 10 percent or more from
1999's record first-quarter performance of 95 cents a share. Analysts surveyed
by First Call/Thomson Financial were projecting earnings of 96 cents per share.
</P>
<P>
	   In trading of the New York Stock Exchange-listed Maytag, shares were down
$3.87 1/2 to $32.50 as of 4:30 p.m. EST.
</P>
<P>
	   "Most people were assuming the results would be about the same as last year.
It now appears they're going to be lower than last year. So I guess that's
surprising," said Russell Leavitt, an analyst with Bank of America Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
	   Today's report follows strong sales in Maytag's fourth quarter of 1999,
which were up 7.7 percent from the same period a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
	   "We had said previously that our (earnings per share) growth would be slower
in the first half, while accelerating through the second half of 2000; that
continues to be our view," Maytag chairman and chief executive Lloyd D. Ward
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag said it expects its Dixie-Narco vending equipment sales to major soft
drink bottlers will be off significantly in its first quarter and that decline
will not likely be offset by home appliance sales, which are expected to be
little different from the prior year.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag also said it expects competitive pressures from new bagless upright
vacuums will continue to dampen growth of sales of its Hoover products. Hoover
will introduce its own advances in bagless upright vacuums in the second
quarter.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag expects growth will accelerate through the second half of the year,
with earnings per share increasing in the range of 15 to 20 percent year over
year, Ward said. The company will be helped by product introductions in floor
care, cooking, dishwashing, foodservice, and refrigeration, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Maytag also announced an alliance with Sanyo Electric Co. to develop and
market home appliance products for the Japanese and Pacific Rim markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Sanyo is one of the world's leading appliance manufacturers with a leading
position in the home and commercial laundry market in Japan.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement with Maytag involves major appliances and floor care products,
with an initial focus on laundry, new cooking technologies and floor and fabric
care products.

<HEADLINE> Oscar Nods Can Turn Into Big Bucks  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVID GERMAIN AP Entertainment Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Oscar statue is not cast from precious metals, but a
nomination can be box-office gold.
</P>
<P>
	   "American Beauty," "The Insider," "The Cider House Rules," "Being John
Malkovich" and other acclaimed films all stand to benefit financially if they
get a best-picture nomination or other major honors when the Academy Award
nominations come out Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Even for movies that ultimately lose the best-picture contest, a nomination
can help double the box-office take by the time the awards are handed out.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Oscars are really worth their weight in gold, at least in terms of box
office," said awards show analyst Thomas O'Neil. (The 8 1/2-pound statuettes are
cast of an alloy of tin, copper and other common metals, then plated with
copper, nickel, silver and gold.)
</P>
<P>
	   Last year, "Shakespeare in Love" and "Life Is Beautiful" were both
flattening out at the box office when best-picture and other nominations gave
them new life. Miramax, which distributed both movies, expanded them to hundreds
more theaters the weekend after the nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   "Shakespeare" had grossed $36.2 million before the nominations and doubled
that by late March, when it won best picture and six other Oscars. The movie
ultimately took in $100.2 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Likewise, the gross for "Life Is Beautiful" doubled to $36.4 million between
nominations and awards time. The film eventually topped out at $57.6 million.
</P>
<P>
	   This year's Oscar race is wide open, with eight to 10 movies potentially in
the running for five best-picture slots.
</P>
<P>
	   While hits such as "The Sixth Sense" ($278.4 million) and "The Green Mile"
($124.4 million) already have been widely seen, best-picture nominations could
pad their theater and home-video take. Films with solid but unspectacular
numbers such as "The Talented Mr. Ripley" ($78 million) and "The Hurricane" ($42
million) also would benefit from best-picture nominations or honors for stars
Matt Damon and Denzel Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   Underachieving movies such as "The Insider," with a disappointing $26.7
million, or more narrowly released films such as "Being John Malkovich" ($21
million) and "The Cider House Rules" ($22.7 million) especially could gain
box-office momentum.
</P>
<P>
	   "Nominations really help with movies that have done well with arthouse or
more sophisticated markets but really haven't reached middle America," said
Robert Bucksbaum, a film analyst with Reel Source Inc. "Everybody wants to see
the show. People want to catch the nominees before Oscar night."
</P>
<P>
	   Best-actress nominations for Hilary Swank in "Boys Don't Cry" and Janet
McTeer in "Tumbleweeds" could prove big boosts for the acclaimed but obscure
movies. "Boys" has grossed $3.7 million and "Tumbleweeds" has taken in $1.3
million.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is one part of our business that's free," said Tom Sherak, head of
distribution for 20th Century Fox, whose Fox Searchlight label released "Boys
Don't Cry." "All this awards stuff is like found awareness, found interest. You
have to be able to capitalize on it."
</P>
<P>
	   "Boys" has been out for five months, but Fox is giving the movie its widest
release yet, about 100 theaters, this Friday to cash in on probable Oscar buzz.
</P>
<P>
	   Oscar alchemy will probably earn "American Beauty," generally viewed as a
lock for a best-picture nomination, millions more on top of the respectable $75
million it already has grossed. DreamWorks, which produced the movie, is
re-releasing "American Beauty" to about 750 theaters three days after the Oscar
nominations come out.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan follows DreamWorks' strategy last year, when it reissued "Saving
Private Ryan" at Oscar time. DreamWorks wrung an additional $26 million out of
the Steven Spielberg film, which had grossed $190 million the year before.
</P>
<P>
	   Oscar nominations do not always mean big bucks. Last year's two other
best-picture nominees, "Elizabeth" and "The Thin Red Line," picked up just $5
million to $6 million between the nominations and awards night. "Elizabeth"
finished with $30 million and "Thin Red Line" $36.4 million.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no downside to a nomination, but there's not necessarily an upside
in the case of every movie," said Paul Dergarabedian, president of box-office
tracker Exhibitor Relations Co.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Plan May Strain Fund  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan by brokerage titan Merrill Lynch to switch some
customers' money into insured bank accounts could lead to a sudden surge in
insured deposits that may strain the federal insurance fund, an FDIC senior
policy analyst warned officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses. But the
move by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which could be emulated by other financial
companies as the line between banking and brokerage blurs, has raised concern
among regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the plan could pump as much as $100 billion into insured bank
accounts without a corresponding increase in insurance premiums paid by banks to
replenish the federal fund, according to a memo by FDIC senior policy analyst
James McFadyen to the director of the agency's research division.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, the FDIC's chairwoman, is expected to raise the issue
Wednesday at a House Banking subcommittee hearing on the bank insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on FDIC material. This
is an industry(-wide) question," said Joe Cohen, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch
at its New York headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant, suggested that by raising the
issue, the FDIC could be trying to make a case for an industrywide increase in
bank insurance premiums. The federal insurance fund was socked by more than $1
billion in losses last year from eight bank failures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not quite sure what game is being played here," said Ely, who is based
in Alexandria, Va. "They're trying to scare people."
</P>
<P>
	   The plan by the world's biggest brokerage firm, announced two weeks ago, is
part of the transformation of the nation's financial landscape brought by
legislation enacted last November allowing banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage firms are offering more banking services, such as home mortgages,
estate planning and federally insured savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy by Merrill involves a new version of its 25-year-old Cash
Management Accounts, which combine interest-bearing checking -- not currently
federally insured -- and a credit card with a brokerage account holding stocks
and bonds. Customers must have $20,000 to open such an account.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in June, Merrill plans to offer customers an option that will
automatically "sweep" the cash now in money-market funds in the Cash Management
Accounts into FDIC-insured savings accounts in its two bank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the Merrill Lynch example, an increase in insured deposits of $100
billion would cause" the reserve ratio -- or the balance of the insurance fund
divided by insured deposits -- from around 1.38 percent to 1.32 percent,
McFadyen, the FDIC policy analyst, said in the memo. A copy was obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Merrill's bank affiliates have the best risk rating, they are not
required to pay FDIC insurance premiums, McFadyen noted in the memo Monday to
William R. Watson, director of the agency's research and statistics division,
and Barry Kolatch, its deputy director.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, barring the unlikely event that the banks' ratings were
downgraded, McFadyen wrote, "no (insurance) fund growth would result from the
insured-deposit growth attributable to the Merrill program."
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted that major brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. manages more than
$100 billion in cash management accounts and other money-market funds. The
possibility that Merrill, Schwab and other financial companies could suddenly
switch large amounts of money into FDIC-insured accounts "raises questions for
the federal deposit insurance system regarding the adequacy of the (insurance)
funds," McFadyen wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ely said he is "a little skeptical that the shift (into insured
accounts) is going to happen that fast."

<HEADLINE> Copernicus Tempts Thieves Worldwide  </HEADLINE>
   By SERGEI SHARGORODSKY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MOSCOW (AP) -- Copies of one of the world's rarest and most valuable books
have been disappearing -- a rash of mysterious thefts that have perplexed police
from the former Soviet Union to the United States.
</P>
<P>
	   The first-edition copies of 16th century astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus'
renowned treatise in Latin, ``De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' (On the
Revolutions of Heavenly Spheres) have vanished from collections across the
globe.
</P>
<P>
	   In Poland, a reader said he had to use the bathroom -- and made off with the
treasured volume. A thief in Kiev, Ukraine, pilfered the book using a fake
police ID. The latest theft of the book, published in 1543 and valued at up to
$400,000, was discovered earlier this month in Russia.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian police say they have appealed to Interpol for help in locating that
book, which disappeared from the Academy of Sciences Library in St. Petersburg.
Police would give no further details.
</P>
<P>
	   At least seven of the 260 known copies of the 1543 edition of ``De
revolutionibus'' have disappeared in recent years, including one copy each from
the University of Illinois at Champaign-Urbana and the Mittag-Leffler Institute
in Stockholm, Sweden, according to Owen Gingerich, a professor at the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass. Five copies
remain missing.
</P>
<P>
	   Some police have speculated that a ring of thieves and collectors is behind
the rash of thefts or that the books may have been stolen on some collectors'
orders.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Gingerich says there is no evidence to suggest an international
conspiracy to steal copies of the treatise, which describes Copernicus'
then-revolutionary theory that the Sun, not the Earth, was at the center of the
universe.
</P>
<P>
	   Gingerich has worked for a quarter-century compiling a list of all known
copies of the first- and second-editions of the work, a quest that has taken him
to cities and libraries worldwide -- and has helped him trace at least two
stolen copies.
</P>
<P>
	   While the book is a tempting target for thieves because of its value, it's
also ``a very dangerous title to steal,'' Gingerich said in an Internet
interview, noting that his census can help identify any known copy, making it
risky to try to sell a stolen copy at auction or on the international antique
market.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, the disappearances continue.
</P>
<P>
	   The theft in Poland occurred in November 1998 at the Polish Academy of
Sciences' library in Krakow, where a man in his 40s asked to read a
first-edition copy of ``De Revolutionibus'' valued at $320,000.
</P>
<P>
	   Sometime later, the reader said he had to visit the toilet -- and
disappeared. He left behind his belongings and the book's covers, said Krakow's
deputy police head Eugeniusz Szczerbak.
</P>
<P>
	   Three months earlier, a man walked out of the Ukrainian National Library in
Kiev carrying a first-edition Copernicus. The thief had an apparently fake
police ID and appeared to be well-acquainted with the library's security
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
	   Librarians said he requested six books, including the Copernicus. He then
returned the books to secure a receipt, took a break and came back to request
more books, including the Copernicus. The man vanished with the rare book just
before closing time, apparently showing the guard the initial receipt to prove
he had returned it.
</P>
<P>
	   Gingerich has helped trace at least two stolen copies. One copy that
surfaced on the book market in 1997 came from the Brno University Library in the
Czech Republic. It had been returned by the library, which kept the book during
Communist times, to the original owner, an Augustinian monastery, from where it
disappeared.
</P>
<P>
	   Another edition that turned up in Germany had come from the Pulkovo
Observatory Library in St. Petersburg, Russia, Gingerich said.
</P>
<P>
	   The library ``suffered a disastrous arson fire ... and apparently someone
thought that the inventory of the library was now so incomplete that a missing
book would be presumed lost in the fire,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton To OK Social Security Bill  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Jumping on a politically popular cause, President Clinton
said Monday he would sign a Republican bill to repeal the Social Security
earnings limit for hundreds of thousands of Americans aged 65-70.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's the right thing to do, let's just do it,'' Clinton said. House
Republicans already were introducing a repeal bill and promised to put it on a
fast track for a vote, likely in March.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's support gives powerful momentum to an election-year drive to
eliminate the earnings penalty, which takes $1 in Social Security benefits from
seniors for every $3 they earn over a prescribed limit, currently $17,000. It is
an issue dear to the hearts of older Americans, an important voting bloc for
Democrats and Republicans in their struggle for control of the White House and
Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Over 800,000 seniors lose part or all of their benefits because of the
earnings limit, according to Social Security Administration estimates. The
earnings ceiling will increase to $30,000 by 2002 under current law.
</P>
<P>
	   The president has advocated eliminating the earnings limit before, but only
as part of a comprehensive plan dealing with the threat of Social Security
insolvency as the baby boom generation retires. Just last week, presidential
spokesman Joe Lockhart said Clinton would not support a piecemeal approach that
doesn't address solvency.
</P>
<P>
	   Lockhart said Clinton's latest remarks, in an interview with CNN, were ``a
step forward.'' Clinton said ``I would be happy to sign'' a repeal -- if it were
a clean bill that ``doesn't have a lot of other things unrelated to that
littered to it.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton's shift came on the heels of a defection by 48 House Democrats on a
Republican bill to give couples -- rich and poor -- relief from the marriage tax
penalty. The House sent the legislation to the Senate last Thursday on a vote of
268-158, a margin insufficient to override a possible veto by Clinton, who has
complained about the bill's cost and timing.
</P>
<P>
	   On Capitol Hill. Rep. E. Clay Shaw, R-Fla., said the House Ways and Means
Social Security subcommittee would act on the repeal bill Wednesday, with full
House action likely in early March.
</P>
<P>
	   Repealing the earnings test would cost roughly $22.7 billion over 10 years,
according to GOP estimates.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaw said Republicans would like to have a broader Social Security reform
bill that would ensure the program's solvency as baby boomers retire. ``We are
going to see that we solve at least this part of the problem,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also urged a wider reform that lengthens the life of the Social
Security trust fund to 2050, and also addresses the poverty problem of women who
are retired.
</P>
<P>
	   Shaw said the GOP is ``very much looking forward'' to getting a bill to the
president's desk in short order. The earnings limit, he added, is a ``dinosaur''
from the Depression when the goal was to set aside scarce jobs for younger
workers.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That may have made sense then, but it doesn't make sense now,'' Shaw said.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said it wasn't fair to penalize workers. ``Secondly, I think as the
baby boomers retire, it's going to be important to have a higher percentage of
people over 65 -- if they want to -- working. This would be good for our
society.''

<HEADLINE> NiSource Halts Columbia Energy Bid  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    HERNDON, Va. (AP) -- NiSource Inc. has halted its hostile takeover attempt
of rival energy distributor Columbia Energy Group.
</P>
<P>
	   NiSource announced Monday that it was withdrawing its offer to Columbia
shareholders to buy that company's stock for $74 per share.
</P>
<P>
	   Ending the hostile takeover attempt will allow NiSource to negotiate a
buyout of Columbia confidentially and on more friendly terms without tipping off
other interested parties to the share price being discussed, it said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than 58 percent of Columbia shareholders had agreed to sell their stock
to NiSource, a majority that could give NiSource some weight in its
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
	   NiSource spokeswoman Maria Hibbs declined to say whether her company will
offer more than $74 per share, an amount Columbia executives deemed inadequate.
</P>
<P>
	   "NiSource could maintain its current offer or offer more or less," Hibbs
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Columbia officials had fought the NiSource buyout, and said Monday they will
continue to explore the possibility of a merger with NiSource or other
companies.
</P>
<P>
	   NiSource, based in Merrillville, Ind., sells electricity, natural gas and
water in the Midwest and Northeast. Columbia, based in Herndon, is a leading
natural gas distribution company.
</P>
<P>
	   Shares of Columbia were trading up 56 1/4 cents at $64.50, while shares of
NiSource were trading at $17.56 1/4, up 12 1/2 cents at 4:30 p.m. on the New
York Stock Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Pataki, Bruno exchange Valentine's wishes, for now  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   LATHAM, N.Y. (AP) - The icy Republican relations between Gov. George
Pataki and state Senate Majority Leader Joseph Bruno appeared to thaw a little
Monday as both men attended a ribbon-cutting event together.
<P>
	   "Valentine's Day is a day of love and togetherness," said Bruno at the Plug
Power plant near Albany that develops fuel cells with chemical reactions to
power homes and cars.
</P>
<P>
	   "If this doesn't represent love and togetherness I don't know what does,"
Bruno said. "And what happens when people work together? Things like this."
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno said he is "proud to have partnered with our great governor, George
Pataki." Then Bruno noted several other "partners," including Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   For his part, Pataki spoke of Bruno's significant role in the
accomplishments during the governor's two terms. Asked if he wants Bruno to
continue to lead the Senate's Republican majority, Pataki said: "It's not my
decision, but I like him."
</P>
<P>
	   Top Republicans worried the Pataki-Bruno feud would detract from a unified
Republican front with the suddenly contentious New York presidential primary
less than a month away, sources said.
</P>
<P>
	   The state GOP leadership's choice, Pataki friend George W. Bush, is fighting
to regain momentum nationally and in New York state after losing to Arizona Sen.
John McCain in New Hampshire's primary in January.
</P>
<P>
	   And last week, Rep. Rick Lazio - drawing parallels with McCain - said he is
seriously considering the state Conservative Party's invitation to enter the
U.S. Senate race, but only if he also had the Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki on Monday repeated his strong support for New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani for Senate.
</P>
<P>
	   Since late January, Pataki and Bruno, of Rensselaer County, have been
fighting over whether the state should pick up the counties' share of a new
health insurance program, plus other policy issues and perceived or actual
slights.
</P>
<P>
	   Most dramatically, those slights included the firing of at least three
Bruno-sponsored state workers in the Pataki administration in an action widely
interpreted by Bruno's members as a show of gubernatorial displeasure in Senate
Republicans. GOP senators also said the governor contacted them directly to ask
about Senate politics, instead of going through Bruno.
</P>
<P>
	   Pataki on Monday would not acknowledge any connection between a spat with
Bruno and the dismissals within his administration.
</P>
<P>
	   "This administration has made thousands of changes over the course of the
last five years and we're going to make thousands more," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   What aides described as a heated meeting last week between Pataki and Bruno
appeared to have helped clear the air somewhat, and staffers for both men
resumed arranging joint public appearances for the pair late last week. Monday
was the first such event. Neither camp on Monday would directly talk about the
reason for the rift.
</P>
<P>
	   Bruno and Pataki are state government's most powerful Republicans, and their
spat came at an important time governmentally, as well as politically.
</P>
<P>
	   This is the time of year when Pataki and Bruno try to reconcile their state
budget agendas for the next fiscal year in hopes of being allied in negotiations
against the Democratic state Assembly, though in current years that has not
always happened.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm hoping that all the differences of opinion or political bumps in the
road are over so we can pass a budget on time, with substance," said Democratic
Assemblyman Paul Tonko of Amsterdam at Monday's event.

<HEADLINE> Penn Defends Itself on Experiment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- The University of Pennsylvania told the federal
government Monday an Arizona teen-ager's death from a gene therapy experiment
was an unavoidable tragedy, not the result of research violations.
</P>
<P>
	   The Food and Drug Administration last month suspended all the university's
gene therapy studies, citing 18 rule violations in the experiment that killed
18-year-old Jesse Gelsinger, of Tucson, Ariz., last fall.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, the university filed a response with the FDA acknowledging some
"procedural" problems but disagreeing with some of the charges.
</P>
<P>
	   The university insisted it immediately notified the FDA of Gelsinger's
death, fully cooperated in the ensuing investigation, and that none of the
alleged violations would have changed Gelsinger's care.
</P>
<P>
	   "With the best medical judgment and scientific information we had, we just
didn't anticipate -- nor in retrospect do we believe we could have anticipated
-- this tragic event," said Dr. Richard Tannen, the university's medical vice
dean.
</P>
<P>
	   Gelsinger's liver was injected with a virus bearing genes designed to
correct a genetic liver disorder. He suffered a toxic reaction and died four
days later. It was the first death attributed to experimental gene therapy.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA has charged that researchers delayed reporting two previously
treated patients who suffered liver toxicity, and that two monkeys died in a
similar experiment. The FDA also questioned whether study participants were
properly informed of the risks.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier this month, Gelsinger's father told Congress researchers "misled"
him about the study's safety.
</P>
<P>
	   The university delayed telling FDA about the sick patients, but did do so
six months before Gelsinger was treated and FDA never stopped the experiment,
Tannen said.
</P>
<P>
	   As for the dead monkeys, he said FDA should have been notified but insisted
the monkeys received far higher doses than Gelsinger.
</P>
<P>
	   The university insisted patients were properly informed about the risks. But
it already has taken steps to improve oversight of clinical trials, Tannen said.
</P>
<P>
	   The FDA said its investigation continues.

<HEADLINE> Romania Refuses To Pay Spill Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Romania said Monday it would not pay
compensation to any other country affected by a cyanide spill that contaminated
two rivers -- a spill rivaling one in the United States that cost $170 million
to clean up.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania said it, too, suffered damage when a dam at the Australian-owned
Baia Mare gold mine in northwest Romania overflowed Jan. 30, sending cyanide
pouring into streams that eventually carried the poison west into Hungary and
Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania had to suffer the most damage from the polluting company and thus
it is entitled to get compensation as Hungary and Yugoslavia are,'' said Gabriel
Dumitrascu of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia, the larger of two republics in Yugoslavia, banned the sale of most
freshwater fish Monday, and Hungary warned of long-term ecological damage as
cleanup crews in the two countries pulled thousands of dead fish from the Tisza
and Danube rivers.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbian fishermen, wearing protective gloves, on Monday scooped dead fish
from the Danube at the Belgrade suburb of Zemun. Downstream, water pumps were
shut off in the Belgrade area town of Vinca, and authorities announced they
would deliver fresh drinking water by truck as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary and Serbia have demanded that Romania pay compensation for the
damage, and the Serbs have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not
met.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimate of the damage and that the culprits for this
tragedy be punished,'' Serb Environment Minister Bratislav Blazic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union, meanwhile, said it was ready to help Hungary and Romania
deal with the spill and would send its top environment official to assess the
damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Environment Program, after receiving a number of requests, said
Executive Director Klaus Toepfer had asked scientists in the area to take water
samples from the Danube, Europe's longest river.
</P>
<P>
	   The Romanians accused Hungary and Serbia of exaggerating the damage, as did
Brett Montgomery, chairman of the gold mine's owner, Esmeralda Exploration in
Perth, Australia. Montgomery said the accident had been grossly exaggerated and
he expected his company to face no compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the U.S.-based Mineral Policy Center said the Eastern
European spill is comparable in size and environmental impact to the 1992
Summitville mine cyanide spill into the Alamosa River in Colorado. The U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency estimates that spill will cost $170 million in
total cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're having to re-establish an entire ecosystem,'' said Steve
D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a private group in
Washington, D.C. ``So it takes years, if not decades.''
</P>
<P>
	   The immediate risk to people who live along the rivers could remain high
long after the cyanide diminishes. D'Esposito said cyanide compounds persist in
groundwater and soils, making it necessary to test crops grown nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the short term, most or all aquatic life will die,'' he said. ``It's a
certainty that a multiyear cleanup and remediation process will be required
costing tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cyanide has been used to extract gold from crushed rock for more than 100
years. Modern methods that mix cyanide compounds in a water-based solution can
recover nearly 100 percent of the gold, making it profitable for mining
companies to process much lower-grade ores.
</P>
<P>
	   In the body, the poison works by blocking the transport of oxygen across
cell walls, with the central nervous system being the most sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   In Hungary, Zoltan Illes, chairman of Parliament's Environment Committee
said the spill represents Europe's ``biggest environmental catastrophe'' since
the 1986 nuclear reactor catastrophe at Chernobyl.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian officials said 83 tons of dead fish had been removed from the
Tisza since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that heavy metals also got into the rivers means an even worse
problem,'' Illes said. ``It will poison the whole food chain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy metals, widely used in industry, are toxic even in small amounts. They
dissolve in water, and spread through the environment through groundwater and
leach into soils.

<HEADLINE> Russia Closes Off Chechen Capital  </HEADLINE>
   By ANDREW KRAMER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NAZRAN, Russia (AP) -- Russia's military has closed off Chechnya's capital
to returning civilians, saying Monday that mined buildings made living there too
dangerous and that rebels may try to come back to the city in disguise.
</P>
<P>
	   Col. Gen. Viktor Kazantsev, a top Russian commander, did not say how long
the ban on residents returning to Grozny would be in effect. The ITAR-Tass news
agency quoted commander Nikolai Zaitsev as saying it would last until March 1.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As long as the city isn't cleared of all mines and shells, and there is a
threat of buildings collapsing, civilians are being banned from entering,''
Kazantsev said on Russia's NTV television. ``Under civilian disguise, militants
are trying to return to pick up their wounded.''
</P>
<P>
	   About 3,000 rebels abandoned Grozny earlier this month and the Russians
claim to control the city. Months of heavy bombing followed by intense street
fighting have left it in ruins, and many refugees say they do not plan to return
anyway. Aid officials said Monday that more than 100 civilians had left Grozny
just in the past day.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian government officials met Monday to discuss how to restore the city,
which once had a population of 400,000.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The government has no money for rebuilding the city,'' presidential aide
Sergei Yastrzhembsky told a news conference in Moscow. Many buildings are mined
or hold ammunition caches, ``which makes the return of civilians to Grozny very
dangerous and difficult,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Elsewhere Monday, Russian troops who have claimed control of most of
Chechnya streamed toward a steep, icy gorge holding the last major rebel
strongholds.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian bombs rained on the slick slopes of the Argun gorge in southern
Chechnya. Helicopters were dropping soldiers to fight their way down into the
remote valleys, NTV reported. Ground fighting was reported Monday around several
villages in the area of the gorge.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are beefing up forces in the direction of the Argun,'' Defense Minister
Igor Sergeyev said after a government meeting in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
	   Sergeyev said the heavy military stage of the offensive in Chechnya would be
over within a month. He said it would be followed by special cleanup operations
conducted by the Interior Ministry, which is in charge of police.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials have talked about aiming to finish off the rebels before
March 26 presidential elections. But Sergeyev insisted that his announcement
Monday was not tied to politics, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian aircraft and artillery have been bombarding the Argun and Vedeno
gorges for weeks, trying to rout rebels from their hide-outs. The gorges form
the rebels' main routes through the mountains to the border with Georgia.
</P>
<P>
	   Russian officials say up to 8,000 militants remain in the mountains, from
which they can launch hit-and-run attacks on Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
	   During the previous war in Chechnya from 1994 to 1996, the Russians lost
Grozny and other areas they had seized in Chechnya to militants who came down
from the mountains. Moscow eventually accepted an uneasy peace deal that gave
the region de facto independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Russia sent troops into Chechnya again last September after Chechen-based
Islamic militants twice invaded the neighboring region of Dagestan. Authorities
also have accused Chechen separatists of orchestrating a series of apartment
bombings that killed about 300 people in Russia last fall.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Ten months after a strike closed Latin America's largest
university, tens of thousands of students returned to classes Monday with both
lingering tensions and hopes for a return to a normal campus life.
</P>
<P>
	   About 2,500 strike supporters marched through the campus to express their
opposition to the reopening of the school, and about 100 clashed with
anti-strike students outside the law school at the National Autonomous
University.
</P>
<P>
	   Students shouted and hurled debris at one another, but there were no reports
of injuries.
</P>
<P>
	   Even so, except for the giant piles of garbage left behind by the strikers,
life on much of the campus appeared remarkably like a normal first day of
school. Students played soccer on school lawns. Some students looked over
outdoor message boards, while others wearing backpacks hustled off to class.
</P>
<P>
	   Patricia Gutierrez, who was headed for her accounting class, said her
education didn't stop during the strike. Like many students, she attended
classes held off the main campus, though that meant she had to spend most of the
day in buses shuttling between makeshift classrooms across the city.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's good to be back,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike at the 270,000-student university was triggered by plans to raise
tuition, which had been just a few cents, to the equivalent of $140 a year. The
strike continued even after the university backed down on the plan to raise
tuition.
</P>
<P>
	   A small group of radical students used the strike not only to press for
academic changes, but also to protest global free-market economic policies they
claimed would exclude the poor from education.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike ended Feb. 6, when unarmed police entered the main campus and
arrested hundreds of strikers, who offered no resistance. Most of the strikers
have been released, but about 250, including top strike leaders, remain in
custody.
</P>
<P>
	   Strike leaders are continuing to press their demands and have called for the
release of all strikers still in custody. They urged students not to return to
classes Monday, but thousands went anyway.
</P>
<P>
	   Preparing the campus for the students' return was a giant task. During the
strike, buildings were vandalized and looted. Juan Monroy, a sanitation worker
at the university, said he has spent the past week working 16 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It seems calm,'' said Hector Ortiz Reyes, an accounting and administration
professor. ``The students seem happy. They are talking. But now there are
proposals for change. The university desperately needs a real structural
reform.''
</P>
<P>
	   Some pro-strike students gathered together outside the engineering school.
They did not go inside. Instead, they flipped through the leftist newspaper La
Jornada.
</P>
<P>
	   Signs of the strike are gradually disappearing. Black and red cloths -- the
symbols of the strike -- lay shredded in a junk heap. White paint obscured the
strikers' demands scrawled on walls.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There may be some people who are still angry with each other,'' said Luis
Arturo Gomez, an engineering student who had opposed the strike.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the best way of dealing with that is silence.''

<HEADLINE> Baseball Stars, Census Join Forces  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Census Bureau is teaming up with three baseball
stars on a series of public service announcements designed to address the issue
of confidentiality.
</P>
<P>
	   Three 30-second television ads, featuring New York Yankees shortstop Derek
Jeter, San Francisco Giants outfielder Barry Bonds and Texas Rangers catcher
Ivan Rodriguez, will begin airing later this month.
</P>
<P>
	   Census Bureau Director Kenneth Prewitt said Monday the players were chosen
in part because of their widespread appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   The players will help ``inform diverse communities about the important role
of Census 2000 as a national civic ceremony and to reassure everyone that the
census is confidential,'' Prewitt said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mayors and local government officials worry that some people, especially
illegal immigrants, may not return their census form out of fear the information
will be shared with other government agencies.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not afraid to steal an extra base, meet a wall head-on or stand in
against a 100 mile-per-hour fastball,'' Bonds says in his ad. ``So why should I
be afraid to fill out the census? Your answers are confidential.''

<HEADLINE> Dow Ends Up 94.63  </HEADLINE>
    By EILEEN GLANTON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks led the market Monday, bounding higher as
investors sought bargains in the wake of Friday's sharp selloff. Technology
stocks shook off some early weakness to finish mostly higher.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 94.63 to close at 10,519.84.
</P>
<P>
	   Broader stock indicators were also higher, although their gains were more
moderate. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 2.82 to 1,389.94, and the Nasdaq
composite index rose 23.10 to 4,418.55.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow recovered some ground following its dismal performance last week,
when the index fell 538.59, including a 218.42-point drop Friday. The Dow
remains 10 percent below its Jan. 14 peak, within the traditional definition of
a market correction.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks have been rattled in recent weeks by investors' worries that most
companies will struggle to maintain strong profit growth if the Federal Reserve
continues raising interest rates this year. Technology companies, which are
growing faster than the industrial and cyclical companies that dominate the Dow,
generally have held up much better than the broader market.
</P>
<P>
	   The Dow's gains on Monday marked the first time since Jan. 31 that the
blue-chip index has outperformed the technology-dominated Nasdaq.
</P>
<P>
	   "The Dow's doing better because cyclical stocks have been just the worst
place to be for the past couple of weeks," said Thomas M. McManus, equity
portfolio strategist at NationsBanc Montgomery Securities in New York. "It seems
like an oversold bounce, though, and I think it's too early to get bullish about
the Dow."
</P>
<P>
	   Cyclical stocks are those that depend on the underlying strength of the
economy for profit growth. Alcoa rose 4 9/16 to 72 1/4 and Caterpillar rose 2
5/8 to 38 5/8, leading the Dow's advance.
</P>
<P>
	   Exxon Mobil rose 2 9/16 to 76 7/16 as the price of crude oil reached $30 per
barrel for the first time since the Persian Gulf War in 1991. U.S. crude oil
inventories are nearing the lowest levels in more than two decades. That's good
news for oil companies, but analysts cautioned that it could lead to inflation
if prices spiral sharply higher.
</P>
<P>
	   On the Nasdaq, software maker Medical Manager Corp. soared 21 3/4 to 86 3/4
after agreeing to be acquired by Healtheon/WebMD, a provider of health care
information.
</P>
<P>
	   NetOptix rose 20 to 156 on the news that it will be acquired by Corning for
$149.18 per share, or about $2 billion in stock. NetOptix makes filters used in
fiber-optic technology.
</P>
<P>
	   But there were some signs of profit-taking among high-tech leaders. Qualcomm
fell 4 7/8 to 127 1/8 and Cisco Systems slipped 7/16 to 130 1/2.
</P>
<P>
	   While analysts were heartened by the Dow's recovery Monday, most believe the
long-term trend toward technology stocks won't change any time soon.
</P>
<P>
	   "Stock selection should be focused on those companies with strong earnings
momentum, which would be mainly technology stocks," said John H. Shaughnessy,
chief investment strategist at Advest Inc.
</P>
<P>
	   McManus suggested that investors should take a second look at some
long-neglected stocks in the financial services, utility and health care
sectors.
</P>
<P>
	   "The market's current fascination with tech has gone just a bit too far," he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Stocks received some additional support from Abby Joseph Cohen, chief market
strategist at Goldman Sachs &AMP; Co. Cohen, one of Wall Street's most consistently
bullish analysts, reiterated her expectation that the S&AMP;P 500 will reach 1,525
by the end of 2000.
</P>
<P>
	   In her comments to the firm's sales force, Cohen also said profit growth and
economic expansion remain strong, providing a solid base for stock market gains.
</P>
<P>
	   Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 10-to-9 margin on the New York
Stock Exchange. NYSE volume totaled 923.64 million shares, compared with 1.02
billion in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
	   The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies rose 2.84 to 5397.94.
</P>
<P>
	   Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average fell 0.8 percent. Germany's Xetra DAX
index rose 0.4 percent, Britain's FT-SE 100 fell 2.0 percent, and France's
CAC-40 closed 0.3 percent lower.

<HEADLINE> Iran Nixes Decision on Candidates  </HEADLINE>
   By AFSHIN VALINEJAD Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's Interior Ministry has rejected a hard-line
council's decision to disqualify more candidates ahead of this week's
legislative elections, calling the decision illegal, a newspaper reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The names of nominees who have been illegally barred from contesting the
elections will be included in the lists of candidates for whom voters can
vote,'' Interior Minister Abdolvahed Mousavi Lari was quoted as saying by the
daily Hamshahri.
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, the hard-line Guardian Council, which vets candidates for
Friday's legislative elections, disqualified more than 600 hopefuls, most of
them reformists.
</P>
<P>
	   Lari, who backs Iran's reformist President Mohammad Khatami, said the
council was trying to disqualify 10 more candidates. But he said its decision
was invalid because it had not provided reasons for the disqualifications,
according to Hamshahri. He did not say whether the 10 were reformists or
hard-liners.
</P>
<P>
	   Javad Ghadimi Zaker, director-general of elections at the Interior Ministry,
said 259 candidates who had been approved have dropped out, leaving 5,824
hopefuls running for the 290 seats of the Majlis, or parliament, the Azad daily
reported.
</P>
<P>
	   Zaker said 36,080 polling booths have been planned for the polls, and that
at least one Interior Ministry inspector would be present at each station,
according to Azad.
</P>
<P>
	   All Iranians age 16 and over are eligible to vote. The Interior Ministry
estimates the size of the electorate at 38.7 million.
</P>
<P>
	   The elections are a showdown between candidates calling for more social
openness and freedom of speech, and hard-liners who fear the Islamic roots of
Iran's 1979 revolution are being forgotten.
</P>
<P>
	   The hard-line Kayhan daily, meanwhile, said Monday that a percussion grenade
exploded late Sunday outside the house of former Intelligence Minister Ali
Fallahian in Isfahan, central Iran. There were no casualties but the bomb
shattered the windows of Fallahian's house, it added.
</P>
<P>
	   Fallahian is running in the parliamentary election from an Isfahan
constituency. Many reformist newspapers hold him responsible for the murder of
several opposition writers and intellectuals in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, the U.S. State Department on Monday said Iran has made
improvements in terms of allowing a free press and more diversity among
candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly there is a lively political culture that has developed there,''
department spokesman James P. Rubin said. ``Clearly candidates from different
orientations are able to run.''
</P>
<P>
	   However, Rubin added that the United States would still like to see some
changes in Iran and deplored death sentences imposed on three members of the
Baha'i religion. The three were arrested in 1997 for violating a government ban
on the practice of their religion.

<HEADLINE> Cost-of-living adjustments again at issue for pensioners  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Though their pension funds are worth more than ever,
retirees from state and local government jobs in New York did not see an
increase in retirement benefits in 1999 and are not now scheduled to get one in
2000 either.
<P>
	   In what union officials call an injustice of the highest order, hundreds of
thousands of public retirees in New York have no right to annual pension
increases tied to the Consumer Price Index or some other cost-of-living gauge.
</P>
<P>
	   "It's the height of hypocrisy, especially where pension funds are now fully
funded for the state or municipalities," said Danny Donohue, president of the
largest public-employee union in New York, the Civil Service Employees
Association.
</P>
<P>
	   Public retirees have gotten two increases to their pensions, in 1995 and
1998. Both came in the form of pension supplementation, a fancy way of saying
they were one-time and not recurring benefit hikes.
</P>
<P>
	   In the meantime, the balance of the state's Common Retirement Fund has
increased from $63.4 billion in 1995 to more than $120 billion today. That fund,
which covers about 300,000 current public employees and 290,000 retirees, has
never been so large.
</P>
<P>
	   The administrator of the Common Retirement Fund, state Comptroller H. Carl
McCall, is again calling for creation of a cost-of-living adjustment mechanism
to be built into the benefit structure to allow retirees to "share some of the
bounty" that the pension fund has enjoyed due to the boom on Wall Street and the
strong economy in general.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall said the lack of annual pension improvements is especially unfair in
light of the fact that state and local taxpayers are now contributing nothing to
the cost of the public retiree pensions. The expansion of the Common Retirement
Fund has allowed the state to steadily cut that government contribution, from
3.7 percent in 1997 to 1.7 percent in 1998 to 0.6 percent in 1999 to zero this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We've done everything we can for employers - now it's time to help
employees and retirees," McCall said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCall is also pushing a plan to lower pension contributions by current
employees in Tier III and Tier IV of the Common Retirement Fund by 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The comptroller, a possible Democratic candidate for governor in 2002 who
considers public pensioners among his most important supporters, said 38 other
states give their public retirees a cost-of-living adjustment.
</P>
<P>
	   A task force appointed by Gov. George Pataki is studying the cost-of-living
increase and other benefit issues in the Common Retirement Fund and the other
public retirement systems in the state. They also include the Teachers'
Retirement System and those involving former New York City employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Traditionally, though sentiment has been high among retirees for
cost-of-living adjustments, it has been impossible to work out a mechanism that
is acceptable to all the retirement systems at the same time, McCall spokesman
Dennis Tompkins said.
</P>
<P>
	   The task force is expected to make recommendations by April 1, giving the
Legislature and governor time during the 2000 legislation session to adopt its
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
	   The speaker of the state Assembly, Sheldon Silver, said Monday he would look
at McCall's plans. Generally speaking, Silver said, the Democrat-controlled
chamber believes pensioners should be rewarded when their retirement funds
perform strongly.
</P>
<P>
	   Donohue said New York government officials have also traditionally had a
funny attitude toward the Common Retirement Fund.
</P>
<P>
	   "Those funds are basically in trust for the people who worked for the
system," he said. "But the CSEA has had to twice go to court to prevent those
funds from being raided. They (state leaders) somehow see those funds as
available for their use."
</P>
<P>
	   About 60 percent of public retirees in New York get pensions of $10,000 or
less a year, according to the Retired Public Employees Association.
</P>
<P>
	   The increases in benefits granted pensioners in 1998 varied widely, from a
few percentage points to 36 percent or more, depending on how long people had
been in retirement and how long they worked.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Gains Against Euro  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar rose against the euro on Monday as stocks
rebounded on Wall Street, but the U.S. currency fell against the yen despite
news of a sharp drop in Japan's trade surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   In late New York trading, the euro was quoted at 97.96 cents, down from
98.69 cents at the same point on Friday. The dollar, meanwhile, was trading at
108.83 Japanese yen, down from late Friday's quote of 108.99 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The advance against the euro came as U.S. share prices repaired some of the
damage from Friday's steep selloff. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 94.63
points to 10,519.84 after sliding 218 points on Friday.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally by stocks also helped limit the yen's gain on the dollar, which
nearly fell below 108 yen despite a report showing that Japan's current account
surplus fell a greater-than-expected 39.9 percent to $7.99 billion in December.
</P>
<P>
	   A shrinking surplus in Japan's current account -- a measure of trade in
merchandise, services, tourism and investment, so a declining surplus --
suggests weaker demand for yen-denominated products and the Japanese currency.
</P>
<P>
	   In other trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.6402 Swiss francs, up from
1.6261 on Friday, and 1.4576 Canadian dollars, up from 1.4506. The British pound
fell to $1.5878 compared with late Friday's quote of $1.5921.
</P>
<P>
	   The currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no longer
traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. Based on Monday's
euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.9949 German marks, up from 1.9824 late
Friday; 6.6907 French francs, up from 6.6487; and 1,974.98 Italian lire, up from
1,962.57.

	   Corning To Acquire NetOptix for $2B
</P>
<P>
	   STURBRIDGE, Mass. (AP) -- Corning Inc., aggressively building its
position in a hot market for optical network technology, announced
three more deals: another sizable acquisition and new ventures with
British Telecom and Samsung Electronics. Corning, the world's
leading supplier of glass fiber, said it is acquiring NetOptix
Corp. of Sturbridge, Mass., for about $2 billion. NetOptix makes
filters that divide light into different wavelengths, a technology
known as DWDM, multiplying the amount of data that can be sent
through each strand of a fiber-optic cable. Separately, Nortel
Networks of Canada announced another major investment to expand its
optical networking business. The company said it plans to spend
$260 million, mostly in Canada and Britain, on top of a $400
million investment announced in November. Overall, the expansion
will triple production capacity and create 3,400 jobs.

	   Boeing Deliveries Delayed by Strike
</P>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- Boeing said today that delivery of aircraft to
buyers has been delayed by the strike by company engineering and
technical workers that began last week. ``It's quite obvious that
the process has slowed,'' Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said. ``But
we're still striving to maintain operations to the best degree
possible.'' The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in
Aerospace, which represents 22,600 engineers and technical workers

both sides.

	   Business Inventories To $1.14T
</P>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- For the 12th straight month, companies added
to their stockpiles of goods on shelves and backlots pushing total
business inventories in December to a seasonally adjusted $1.14
trillion, the Commerce Department said today. U.S. companies
boosted their inventories by a modest 0.5 percent in December but
their sales vaulted ahead at more than twice that pace, a sign that
businesses are struggling to keep up with hardy demand, economists
said. At the same time, sales grew by a sizzling 1.1 percent in
December to $868.8 billion. That increase brought the
inventory-to-sales ratio to a record low of 1.32, meaning it would
take 1.32 months to exhaust inventories at the December sales pace.

	   Disputes Delay World Trade Talks
</P>
<P>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Prospects for a rapid resumption of
world trade negotiations weakened Monday with differences between
rich and poor nations remaining wide at a U.N. trade conference.
Participants at this week's U.N. Conference on Trade and
Development in Bangkok have hoped the meetings would help heal
divisions over free trade that caused the collapse of December's
trade talks in Seattle. But instead, a consensus is growing among
many developing countries that their needs must be fully included
before they are willing to agree to any new trade talks. UNCTAD
promotes trade as a way for poor countries to develop, while the
World Trade Organization sets the rules that regulate trade. The
UNCTAD meeting is the first major trade conference since the WTO
talks in Seattle.

	   PC Sales Hit High in East Asia
</P>
<P>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) -- Just over 14.1 million PCs were sold in East
Asia last year, International Data Corporation Asia-Pacific said
Monday. That put personal computer sales at an all-time high in
1999, as the region shook off its economic crisis. In 1998, sales
were 10.5 million, a slight decline from 1997. South Korea was the
country that contributed most to the Asian PC boom. PC sales there
shot up by 79.2 percent to a total of 2.19 million units in 1999.

	   News Corp. May Create Satellite Co.
</P>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) -- News Corp., the far-flung media empire
controlled by Rupert Murdoch, may consolidate its satellite
businesses into one unit. The company said it was too soon to say
exactly which assets would be pooled into the new business or
whether it would be publicly traded, as is News Corp.'s
entertainment subsidiary, Fox Entertainment Group. News Corp.
issued a statement on the matter after an article appeared in
today's editions of The Wall Street Journal saying the company was
planning to group its various satellite operations into a new,
publicly traded company. If the consolidation comes to pass, it
would represent a bet on Murdoch's part that satellite TV will play
a major role in delivering TV signals as well as other types of
entertainment and media into homes outside the U.S., where News
Corp.'s satellite presence is strongest.

percent today after the appliance maker warned of weaker earnings
due to expected flat sales in its home appliances, increased
competition in floor care products and decreased sales of vending
machines. Maytag said its earnings per share could be off 10
percent or more from 1999's record first quarter performance of 95
cents a share. Today's report follows strong sales in Maytag's
fourth-quarter of 1999, which were up 7.7 percent from the same

<HEADLINE> Power Authority sells Indian Point 3, Fitzpatrick plants  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) - The New York Power Authority, getting out of
the nuclear energy business, announced a tentative agreement Monday to sell its
Indian Point 3 plant in Westchester and its Fitzpatrick plant north of Syracuse.
<P>
	   While refusing to rule out any future involvement with nuclear energy,
President Eugene Zeltmann said the Power Authority was out of the business
"certainly for the foreseeable future."
</P>
<P>
	   On the other hand, the buyer, Entergy Corp. of New Orleans, said the
purchase would be an important step toward its planned growth in the Northeast.
President Jerry Yelverton acknowledged interest in buying the two other reactors
at Indian Point, now owned by Con Edison.
</P>
<P>
	   "What we're looking at is a region," Yelverton said at a White Plains news
conference. "These New York plants certainly fit within that strategy."
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy bought the Pilgrim nuclear plant in Plymouth, Mass. from Boston
Edison last year in what was the first nuclear plant sale by a utility in the
United States. If the NYPA sale goes through, it will have seven plants around
the country.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy also has a tentative deal with Rochester Gas and Electric to lease
the Nine Mile Point 1 and 2 power plants near Oswego and to operate them if the
utility succeeds in buying them.
</P>
<P>
	   The $806 million deal with NYPA must be approved by the company's directors,
the Power Authority's trustees, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and other
regulators. That could take six months, Zeltmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the proposed deal, Entergy will make a $50 million down payment,
followed by $84 million a year for seven years. In addition, it will pay $24
million a year for seven years for the plant's nuclear fuel.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase price is probably good news for the Hendrick Hudson school
district, which will have the Indian Point plant back on the tax rolls.
Assistant Superintendent Nancy Bocassi said the district is "cautiously
optimistic" pending a meeting with Entergy. Westchester County Executive Andrew
Spano said the fair tax value had yet to be determined, since the companies have
not said how much of the $806 million is for Indian Point.
</P>
<P>
	   NYPA, which provides more than a quarter of the state's electricity, is
likely to be buying most of the plants' output for its current customers, at
least through 2004. Under the agreement, Entergy will make available to the
Power Authority 100 percent of Indian Point 3's output and up to 46 percent of
the Fitzpatrick output through that year.
</P>
<P>
	   "We'll keep right on supplying low-cost energy to more than 100 government
customers here in Westchester County and in New York City," Zeltmann said.
</P>
<P>
	   Yelverton said Entergy plans "to be one of the big players, one of the
owners of multiple facilities in the future of nuclear power."
</P>
<P>
	   Zeltmann said that means the deal should be good all around - for the buyer,
the seller, the plants' employees and consumers.
</P>
<P>
	   "We must recognize the inherent advantages that large nuclear enterprises,
operating multiple units, have over smaller operators in achieving economies of
scale and maximizing efficiency," he said. Among those advantages, he added, is
Entergy's abilities to offer advancement opportunities to nuclear employees.
</P>
<P>
	   Entergy said it would honor existing union contracts at the two plants,
which employ about 1,700. No staff cuts are expected.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Plan May Strain Fund  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan by brokerage titan Merrill Lynch to switch some
customers' money into insured bank accounts could lead to a sudden surge in
insured deposits that may strain the federal insurance fund, an FDIC senior
policy analyst warned officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses. But the
move by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which could be emulated by other financial
companies as the line between banking and brokerage blurs, has raised concern
among regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the plan could pump as much as $100 billion into insured bank
accounts without a corresponding increase in insurance premiums paid by banks to
replenish the federal fund, according to a memo by FDIC senior policy analyst
James McFadyen to the director of the agency's research division.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, the FDIC's chairwoman, is expected to raise the issue
Wednesday at a House Banking subcommittee hearing on the bank insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on FDIC material. This
is an industry(-wide) question," said Joe Cohen, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch
at its New York headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant, suggested that by raising the
issue, the FDIC could be trying to make a case for an industrywide increase in
bank insurance premiums. The federal insurance fund was socked by more than $1
billion in losses last year from eight bank failures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not quite sure what game is being played here," said Ely, who is based
in Alexandria, Va. "They're trying to scare people."
</P>
<P>
	   The plan by the world's biggest brokerage firm, announced two weeks ago, is
part of the transformation of the nation's financial landscape brought by
legislation enacted last November allowing banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage firms are offering more banking services, such as home mortgages,
estate planning and federally insured savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy by Merrill involves a new version of its 25-year-old Cash
Management Accounts, which combine interest-bearing checking -- not currently
federally insured -- and a credit card with a brokerage account holding stocks
and bonds. Customers must have $20,000 to open such an account.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in June, Merrill plans to offer customers an option that will
automatically "sweep" the cash now in money-market funds in the Cash Management
Accounts into FDIC-insured savings accounts in its two bank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the Merrill Lynch example, an increase in insured deposits of $100
billion would cause" the reserve ratio -- or the balance of the insurance fund
divided by insured deposits -- to fall from around 1.38 percent to 1.32 percent,
McFadyen, the FDIC policy analyst, said in the memo. A copy was obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Merrill's bank affiliates have the best risk rating, they are not
required to pay FDIC insurance premiums, McFadyen noted in the memo Monday to
William R. Watson, director of the agency's research and statistics division,
and Barry Kolatch, its deputy director.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, barring the unlikely event that the banks' ratings were
downgraded, McFadyen wrote, "no (insurance) fund growth would result from the
insured-deposit growth attributable to the Merrill program."
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted that major brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. manages more than
$100 billion in cash management accounts and other money-market funds. The
possibility that Merrill, Schwab and other financial companies could suddenly
switch large amounts of money into FDIC-insured accounts "raises questions for
the federal deposit insurance system regarding the adequacy of the (insurance)
funds," McFadyen wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ely said he is "a little skeptical that the shift (into insured
accounts) is going to happen that fast."

<HEADLINE> Teacher Test Delays Draw Fire  </HEADLINE>
   By ANJETTA McQUEEN AP Education Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Clinton administration delays in gathering test scores on
teaching exams drew a chorus of criticism Monday from House Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last month, the Education Department gave colleges an extra year to
report their graduates' performances on state teacher-licensing exams.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports were to have begun in April under a 1998 student aid law. The
law additionally required states to identify colleges that consistently produce
poor teaching candidates and allowed the department to withhold aid from
poor-performing programs.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, 32 Democrats sent a letter to Education Secretary Richard Riley
demanding an explanation for the year's delay.
</P>
<P>
	   The department needs that much time to create one reporting system to cover
the varying state examinations, Lee Fritschler, Riley's higher education deputy
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The report card doesn't create any new tests or impose any new mandates on
schools,'' said Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., a member of the House Education and
Workforce Committee, who led the revolt against the delay. He and others of the
centrist New Democrat Coalition said they want the scores published by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
	   Criticism also came from a Republican. Rep. Bill Goodling of Pennsylvania,
who chairs the education committee, called the yearlong delay excessive.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports would make more than 1,300 colleges that educate teachers more
accountable, said lawmakers. They charge that teacher colleges are hostile to
the idea of reporting their students' scores.
</P>
<P>
	   Fritschler said the department explained its concerns in an interim report
issued earlier this month: ``Many states don't keep the information we want or
need; those who do, keep it in many different categories and formats.''
</P>
<P>
	   Last month, Rep. George Miller, D-Calif., a senior member of the committee
who is not a part of the moderate Democrat group, blasted the delay as evidence
the administration is buckling to pressure from college interest groups.
</P>
<P>
	   The reports are among several measures meant to address low performances by
the nation's schoolchildren and raise the standards to which they are held.
</P>
<P>
	   Jeanne Brennan, a spokeswoman for Education Trust, a Washington-based
advocacy group for poor minority students, applauded the criticism: ``It is
sheer folly to expect that schools will be able to get students to higher levels
of achievement unless institutions of higher education take their responsibility
to prepare teachers more seriously.''

<HEADLINE> House Democrats roll out reform package  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - House Democrats on Monday laid out their plans
for reforming the election process, the county sheriff system and the state
treasurer's office.
<P>
	   They plan to propose a voluntary, publicly funded campaign finance system by
creating a "citizens election fund" filled with volunteer donations made through
a checkoff on the state income tax return.
</P>
<P>
	   Single filers would be able to earmark $5 in tax money for the fund, and
joint filers could contribute $10. Campaign money would also come from limited
fund raising, corporate checkoffs and state and town political committees.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the House Democrats' plan, candidates for governor could spend up to
$3.95 million for an election, and people running for constitutional offices
such as attorney general or treasurer could spend as much as $523,000.
Legislative races would not be publicly financed.
</P>
<P>
	   Rep. Alex Knopp, D-Norwalk, said that breaks down to about $1.75 from every
voter.
</P>
<P>
	   "For $1.75 per voter, we would be able to elect a governor in the state
without a single dollar of PAC money, without a single dollar of lobbyist money
... and without a single dollar of any other kind of special interest funds,"
Knopp said. "We think the public will agree that the small sum of $1.75 per
voter is a worthy price."
</P>
<P>
	   Senate Democrats are also calling for publicly financed campaigns.
</P>
<P>
	   But House Republican leader Robert Ward, R-Northfield, said publicly funded
campaigns are not a good idea.
</P>
<P>
	   "They're making an assumption that that everyone will check off," he said.
"I'm not planning to, so their numbers are already off. I'm not giving everyone
money so they can campaign. I'll give money to candidates I believe in."
</P>
<P>
	   Gov. John G. Rowland has not taken a position on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   "He thinks everything should be on the table and open for discussion,"
Rowland spokesman Dean Pagani said.
</P>
<P>
	   Democratic and Republican lawmakers also disagree on how to reform the state
treasurer's office in the wake of the Paul Silvester scandal. The former
treasurer pleaded guilty to money laundering and embezzlement charges. Among
other things, he admitted taking kickbacks from "finder's fees" paid by
corporations to individuals who helped set up investment deals with the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Both sides of the aisle want to do away with the informal fees and close
loopholes that may allow treasurers to benefit from pension investments.
</P>
<P>
	   Republicans want an oversight board to control pension investments. But
Democrats and current Treasurer Denise Nappier are proposing tighter
regulations.
</P>
<P>
	   "We still feel very strongly that the number of suggestions Denise Nappier
has offered are sufficient," said House Speaker Moira Lyons, D-Stamford. "There
is not the need to do an advisory board."
</P>
<P>
	   Legislative leaders are close to agreeing how to scrap the sheriffs system.
Both Democrats and Republicans want a constitutional amendment abolishing the
office of high sheriff. They also agree that the state's Judicial Branch should
oversee the work done by the special deputies who guard courthouses.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats say the special deputies who transport prisoners should also be
under the purview of the Judicial Branch, while Republicans want that job
controlled by the Department of Correction.
</P>
<P>
	   "Everyone agrees something needs to be done soon," said Rep. Michael Lawlor,
D-East Haven.

<HEADLINE> First lady picks up Irish award  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton on Monday picked up an award
for her work to bring peace to Ireland from an organization of Irish American
Democrats.
<P>
	   The award comes after the first lady waded into trouble in the Irish
community by agreeing to march in New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Many
Democrats avoid the parade because it excludes the Irish Lesbian and Gay
Organization. Clinton's likely U.S. Senate race rival, New York City Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, always marches in the parade.
</P>
<P>
	   It also comes as the peace process itself threatens to tear apart. Last
week, the 10-week-old Cabinet of Protestants and Catholics in Belfast was
suspended after the Irish Republican Army refused to disarm. The power-sharing
cabinet was the centerpiece of the 1998 Good Friday Peace Accord. The British
and Irish governments are working to salvage the joint administration.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady's award Monday came from The Irish American Democrats, a
Washington D.C.-based political action committee, which describes itself as
"providing support to Democratic candidates who promote peace, justice and
prosperity in Ireland."
</P>
<P>
	   On its web site, the organization said the first lady would be a "vital
voice for Ireland in the U.S. Senate." There is a photo of the first lady on the
site as well as the statement: "Irish Americans Love Hillary."
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has visited Ireland several times and spoken out for the
peace process. The Irish community is a powerful voting block in New York, where
Clinton is running for the U.S. Senate.

<HEADLINE> NBC Has New Affiliate in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
    By JESSIE SEYFER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- NBC announced a new station affiliation agreement in
the San Francisco region Monday after the new owners of the current affiliate
balked at the network's demands.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal will make KNTV, which is owned by the New York-based station group
Granite Broadcasting Corp., the new NBC affiliate in the San Francisco Bay area
as of Jan. 1, 2002.
</P>
<P>
	   The agreement calls for Granite to pay NBC $362 million over nine years, a
reversal of the traditional network-affiliate deals under which networks pay
local stations to carry their shows. Networks, which now have other options for
carrying their signal such as cable and satellite, have been trying to change
the agreements for some time.
</P>
<P>
	   The deal was announced four days after Young Broadcasting Inc., whose record
$823 million purchase of KRON-TV is pending before the Federal Communications
Commission, rejected continued affiliation with the network.
</P>
<P>
	   Chairman Vincent Young said he found NBC's financial terms "totally
unacceptable" and said he would turn KRON-TV into an independent after the
station's affiliation with NBC ends in two years.
</P>
<P>
	   KNTV, the new affiliate, is based in San Jose, about 40 miles south at the
end of San Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
	   Don Cornwell, chief executive officer of Granite, acknowledged in a
conference call that even with cable's reach, some 20 percent of viewers north
of San Jose may not be able to pick up KNTV's signal. But he said the FCC had
granted the station permission to double its transmission power, and said the
station was exploring other options such as moving its transmitter further
north.
</P>
<P>
	   KNTV is currently an ABC affiliate, but that relationship is scheduled to
end in July. Eric Hulnick, KNTV's vice president of news and operations, said
the station will carry WB programs during prime time. Granite also operates
KBWB, a San Francisco-based WB affiliate.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, networks have paid affiliates to broadcast their programs, but
NBC's deal with Granite shows that money now seems to be flowing the opposite
direction, with affiliates paying networks.
</P>
<P>
	   "It used to be that the only way a network was going to get its signal out
was through an affiliate," said Hulnick. "I think cable has changed all that,
and so have satellites, and the Internet. Networks now have alternatives in how
to get their signal to people. In local markets, there's a lot more
competition."
</P>
<P>
	   As part of the deal with Granite, NBC acquired warrants to buy 4.5 million
shares of Granite Broadcasting, an 18 percent stake in the company. KNTV will
have the exclusive right to NBC's future digital television initiatives.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Oil Hits $30 a Barrel  </HEADLINE>
    By DAVE CARPENTER AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OPEC's tightening vise on world oil stocks squeezed crude prices over $30 a
barrel Monday for the first time since the eve of the Persian Gulf War nine
years ago.
</P>
<P>
	   The latest increase, nearly 3 percent, continues a steep price rise that has
seen oil increase by 166 percent since bottoming out at $11.37 last February.
And industry watchers warned that $30 could quickly go to thirtysomething, and
perhaps even higher.
</P>
<P>
	   "Prices are going to continue to rise until OPEC adds production," said Adam
Sieminski, an analyst for Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown. "Simply put -- there's not
enough oil."
</P>
<P>
	   In other commodity markets, cocoa dived to a 27-year low and pork bellies
fell the maximum amount allowed.
</P>
<P>
	   After coming within a nickel of $30 last month, the price of crude burst
through that barrier with little resistance Monday on the New York Mercantile
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   The price of near-term oil, for March delivery, increased 81 cents to $30.25
a barrel after topping out at $30.30. That's the highest since Jan. 16, 1991,
the day before the Allied military air strikes began on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   Analysts cited two developments for pushing oil past the landmark $30 level:
</P>
<P>
	   -- A reaction to Friday's report by the International Energy Agency which
said fourth-quarter oil inventories shrank by the largest amount in a decade and
are probably declining at an even more rapid rate now.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Iraq's disclosure that it has slashed its U.N.-monitored oil exports by
some 10 percent -- 200,000 to 300,000 barrels -- a day after it threatened
further cuts unless the United Nations removes its hold on contracts for spare
parts.
</P>
<P>
	   Oil experts now worry that even if the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries loosens its clampdown on production, any additional crude will be
almost canceled out by the amount Iraq has taken off the market.
</P>
<P>
	   Thanks in part to Asia's recovering economies, world oil demand is forecast
to rise 2.4 percent this year to 77 million barrels a day, according to the IEA,
meaning production would have to rise 1.8 million barrels daily just to keep up
with that growth.
</P>
<P>
	   Daily developments aside, the driving force behind the price surge remains
OPEC's unity in adhering to its March 31 decision to reduce output after prices
sank to levels that endangered the nations' prosperity.
</P>
<P>
	   "This is just another milestone in the new OPEC," said Phil Flynn, senior
market analyst for Alaron Trading Corp. in Chicago. "What we've seen here is a
new, smarter OPEC."
</P>
<P>
	   So far, despite higher costs for everything from gasoline and heating oil to
shipping costs and air fares, consumers in the United States -- the world's
biggest oil importer -- have endured the whopping price rise with little more
than a few grumbles.
</P>
<P>
	   Unless a public furor leads to White House pressure on Saudi Arabia and
others to end the production squeeze, the trend is likely to continue at least
until OPEC's meeting next month in Vienna, Austria.
</P>
<P>
	   "The price will have to go high enough that the politicians will yell and
scream," said Sieminski. "When Bill Clinton calls up (OPEC leaders) ... then
something will happen."
</P>
<P>
	   In other energy commodities, March heating oil rose 1.46 cent to 75.70 cents
a barrel; March unleaded gasoline rose 2.34 cents to 83.41 cents a gallon; March
natural gas fell 2.9 cents to $2.541 per 1,000 cubic feet.
</P>
<P>
	   March Brent crude from the North Sea rose 94 cents to $28.76 a barrel --
also a nine-year high -- on London's International Petroleum Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   Cocoa prices plummeted on New York's Coffee, Sugar &AMP; Cocoa Exchange as heavy
crop arrivals reach a climax at West African ports. The latest selloff in a bear
market came a day before delivery day for the spot contract, meaning traders
were in a rush to get out of commitments to take on more beans.
</P>
<P>
	   May cocoa settled $19 lower at $773 per ton after dropping all the way to
$735.
</P>
<P>
	   Frozen pork bellies tumbled the limit 3 cents on the Chicago Mercantile
Exchange on concerns that a 2 percent rise in the slaughter rate from the
previous week may send more meat into freezers and depress wholesale demand.
</P>
<P>
	   March pork bellies fell the limit 3 cents to 85.25 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Plan OKs Unlimited Crop Subsidies  </HEADLINE>
   By PHILIP BRASHER AP Farm Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- As many as 2,600 of the nation's biggest farms, including
corporate operations, stand to reap millions of dollars in unlimited crop
subsidies under a new program that lets growers circumvent the standard
$150,000-per-producer restriction.
</P>
<P>
	   Farmers who have reached the payment limit will be allowed to take crop
subsidies in certificates, instead of cash, which they can redeem for
government-held commodities.
</P>
<P>
	   Congress authorized the program last fall, and Agriculture Secretary Dan
Glickman said Monday that he agreed to implement it under pressure from
lawmakers. ``The certificate program is one that the Congress is very clear they
want,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Critics say the program effectively abolishes the subsidy limit, which
already was doubled from $75,000 last year, and will subsidize expansion of
large operations. The subsidy program pays farmers the difference between the
market price of major commodities and government-set minimum prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Among operations that stand to benefit most, according to Agriculture
Department officials, is cotton giant J.G. Boswell Co., which controls an
estimated 160,000 acres in California's San Joaquin Valley. At current subsidy
rates, a cotton farm can reach the $150,000 payment limit with fewer than 1,000
acres. All major commodities would be eligible for the program.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is nobody who thinks we should spend money on farm programs to help
the big operations push out the small, but that's what we're doing,'' said Chuck
Hassebrook, program director of the Center for Rural Affairs in Walthill, Neb.
``The effects of this are absolutely counter to everything the farm program
should be designed to do.''
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman's advisers said he had little choice but to approve the program,
given the bipartisan congressional support for it and the possibility that
farmers facing the payment limit would otherwise forfeit up to a million bales
of cotton to the government this year.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA rules allow farmers to put crops under short-term federal loans and
forfeit the commodity to the government instead of repaying the loan. Farmers
would make a profit off the forfeiture -- which doesn't count toward the
$150,000 subsidy limit -- because the market value of the crop is less than the
value of the loan.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Cotton Council, which led lobbying for the certificate program,
argued that it would provide for a more orderly marketing of the cotton than
dumping it on the government, which would have sold it later, possibly
depressing prices. The government also would save on storage costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``From our perspective the best bet for all producers is to get the cotton
out into the market. That's the main thing the producers want to do,'' said Bill
Gillon, a spokesman for the cotton group.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead of agreeing to issue the certificates, Glickman should have
tightened up the loan program to make it less advantageous for farmers to
forfeit their crops, Hassebrook said.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman's decision comes at a time when he is pushing Congress to put more
restrictions on government farm payments to target assistance to small and
medium-sized aid.
</P>
<P>
	   Keith Collins, USDA's chief economist, acknowledged that the certificate
program would do just the opposite. ``There's no doubt it's a concern. Here the
secretary has been advocating a tight payment limit,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA estimates that 2,600 farms nationwide will reach the $150,000 cap this
year.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorization for the program was put into USDA's 2000 budget last fall by
Sen. Thad Cochran, a Mississippi Republican who chairs the Senate Appropriations
agricultural subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
	   Cochran was among lawmakers urging Glickman to implement the program. Others
included Democrats Sen. Blanche Lincoln, Arkansas, and Rep. Cal Dooley,
California, whose district includes the San Joaquin Valley.
</P>
<P>
	   Glickman announced the program during a visit to the region last week.

<HEADLINE> German Party May Nix Gov. Support  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERLIN (AP) -- A small party that holds the key to keeping together the
governing coalition in the central German state of Hesse said Monday it would
call a special convention to decide whether to keep supporting the state's
embattled governor.
</P>
<P>
	   Should the Free Democrats withdraw their support for Roland Koch of the
Christian Democrats, it could pave the way for new state elections.
</P>
<P>
	   If there is an election, Koch's party is expected to lose. And Koch's
downfall would mark the first political casualty of the scandal stemming from
illegal party financial practices during the government of ex-Chancellor Helmut
Kohl, also of the Christian Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   A political loss for Koch would be a boon for Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
giving him a majority in Germany's upper house of parliament, the Bundesrat.
</P>
<P>
	   The Free Democrats' special meeting, set for March 4, came after pressure
from the party's federal branch for the state branch to pull out of the state
coalition.
</P>
<P>
	   Koch's reputation has been tainted since he recently admitted that he
declared $750,000 in campaign funds as a loan even though he knew it had come
from a state party slush fund.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, top Christian Democrat officials met to discuss the consequences
of the scandal -- a day before the party was to learn how much it will be
ordered to pay for campaign finance violations. Media reports have said the fine
could reach the equivalent of $20.5 million.
</P>
<P>
	   Schroeder attacked opposition leaders for appealing to parliamentary
president Wolfgang Thierse, who determines the fine, to show leniency or risk
bankrupting the party.
</P>
<P>
	   In an interview with North German broadcasting, Schroeder said such
``scandalous behavior'' could leave the impression that the Christian Democrats
``want to break laws or at the very least, don't take them seriously.''
</P>
<P>
	   The scandal flared after Kohl revealed he had accepted the equivalent of up
to $1 million in donations from people he has refused to identify.
</P>
<P>
	   He has insisted the money came from people wanting to support the Christian
Democrats' activities in formerly communist eastern Germany. But his steadfast
refusal to name the donors has fueled speculation about possible kickbacks or
bribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Kohl, praised just a few months ago the man who reunited Germany, saw his
political isolation grow. On Monday, organizers of the biannual Westphalia peace
prize, which Kohl was to have received in June, said they along with the former
chancellor had decided not to go ahead with the prize ceremony.
</P>
<P>
	   The $50,000 prize, awarded for the first time in 1998 to Czech President
Vaclav Havel, is divided between the winner and a European youth organization.
The prize foundation said Kohl could be given the prize next year.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Delegation Visits Colombia  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- As new figures showed a 20 percent rise in
Colombian cocaine production, a high-level U.S. delegation met Monday with
leaders of this turbulent nation to discuss a drug-fighting aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit was led by Thomas Pickering, the State Department's third-ranking
official. It came as the U.S. Congress was opening debate on the proposed
two-year, $1.6 billion aid package that would dramatically escalate the war on
drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Primarily a military aid plan, the package includes 63 helicopters and the
training and equipping of two new army counter-drug battalions. It aims to give
Colombia the firepower, mobility and intelligence to defeat leftist rebels who
protect drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   The Andean country solidified its place last year as the world's principal
source of cocaine, according to new figures compiled by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Cultivation of coca, the drug's raw material, increased 20 percent in
Colombia last year, the figures said. Land used for the drug totaled 465 square
miles, up from 393 square miles in 1998, according to the estimates provided to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca cultivation has long been widespread in neighboring South American
countries too. But due largely to Colombia's instability -- nearly half the
country is controlled by leftist rebels and their paramilitary foes, both
largely financed by the drug trade -- traffickers have moved the bulk of coca
cultivation here since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, acreage devoted to the shiny green coca bush dropped in
neighboring Peru from 197 to 150 square miles from 1998 to 1999 and in Bolivia
from 147 to 85 square miles, the new figures show.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, estimated cocaine production in the region was down over the period
from 825 to 765 metric tons, the CIA believes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a result of the successful counterdrug operations in Peru and Bolivia,
the traffickers have been shifting their operations and consolidating their
cocaine production in Colombia,'' U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey said in a
statement from Washington. ``We have actually seen significant reductions in
coca cultivation in Colombia where eradication programs are carried out.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton Administration's aid package would permit an army push this year
into guerrilla-dominated southern jungles, where Colombian officials say the
coca crop has tripled in the past two years. U.S.-trained troops would provide
ground and air protection while planes spray herbicides on the crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed resistance could come from the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia -- the guerrilla group that dominates the countryside of southern
Putumayo state, taxes the coca and protects drug laboratories and clandestine
airstrips.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Colombia's defense minister is expecting violent peasant protests.
Tens of thousands of peasants in Putumayo -- many of them internal refugees of
the country's nearly 36-year civil conflict -- depend on coca for their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   President Andres Pastrana said in an interview with The Associated Press
last week that his government expects thousands of those peasants to be
displaced once the cocaine crops are killed. Some will have to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed U.S. aid package includes $176 million for resettling uprooted
peasants and helping them find a legal way to make a living. Apart from the
usual counter-narcotics and military officials, the U.S. delegation in Colombia
this time included Julia Taft, the State Department's top refugee official.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Colombian government resettlement and alternative development plans
-- promoting crops including coffee and cotton -- are still in early planning
stages.

<HEADLINE> Merrill Lynch Plan May Strain Fund  </HEADLINE>
    By MARCY GORDON AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A plan by brokerage titan Merrill Lynch to switch some
customers' money into insured bank accounts could lead to a sudden surge in
insured deposits that may strain the federal insurance fund, an FDIC senior
policy analyst warned officials Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The bank insurance fund, which backs each account up to $100,000, has an
adequate cushion -- some $29 billion -- to cover depositors' losses from bank
failures. But the move by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co., which could be emulated by other
financial companies as the line between banking and brokerage blurs, has raised
concern among regulators at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.
</P>
<P>
	   That's because the plan could pump as much as $100 billion into insured bank
accounts without a corresponding increase in insurance premiums paid by banks to
replenish the federal fund, according to a memo by FDIC senior policy analyst
James McFadyen to the director of the agency's research division.
</P>
<P>
	   Donna Tanoue, the FDIC's chairwoman, is expected to raise the issue
Wednesday at a House Banking subcommittee hearing on the bank insurance fund.
</P>
<P>
	   "We don't think it is appropriate for us to comment on FDIC material. This
is an industry(-wide) question," said Joe Cohen, a spokesman for Merrill Lynch
at its New York headquarters.
</P>
<P>
	   Bert Ely, a banking industry consultant, suggested that by raising the
issue, the FDIC could be trying to make a case for an industrywide increase in
bank insurance premiums. The federal insurance fund was socked by more than $1
billion in losses last year from eight bank failures.
</P>
<P>
	   "I'm not quite sure what game is being played here," said Ely, who is based
in Alexandria, Va. "They're trying to scare people."
</P>
<P>
	   The plan by the world's biggest brokerage firm, announced two weeks ago, is
part of the transformation of the nation's financial landscape brought by
legislation enacted last November allowing banks, securities firms and insurance
companies to get into each other's businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   Brokerage firms are offering more banking services, such as home mortgages,
estate planning and federally insured savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
	   The strategy by Merrill involves a new version of its 25-year-old Cash
Management Accounts, which combine interest-bearing checking -- not currently
federally insured -- and a credit card with a brokerage account holding stocks
and bonds. Customers must have $20,000 to open such an account.
</P>
<P>
	   Starting in June, Merrill plans to offer customers an option that will
automatically "sweep" the cash now in money-market funds in the Cash Management
Accounts into FDIC-insured savings accounts in its two bank affiliates.
</P>
<P>
	   "In the Merrill Lynch example, an increase in insured deposits of $100
billion would cause" the reserve ratio -- or the balance of the insurance fund
divided by insured deposits -- to fall from around 1.38 percent to 1.32 percent,
McFadyen, the FDIC policy analyst, said in the memo. A copy was obtained by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Because Merrill's bank affiliates have the best risk rating, they are not
required to pay FDIC insurance premiums, McFadyen noted in the memo Monday to
William R. Watson, director of the agency's research and statistics division,
and Barry Kolatch, its deputy director.
</P>
<P>
	   Therefore, barring the unlikely event that the banks' ratings were
downgraded, McFadyen wrote, "no (insurance) fund growth would result from the
insured-deposit growth attributable to the Merrill program."
</P>
<P>
	   He also noted that major brokerage Charles Schwab Corp. manages more than
$100 billion in cash management accounts and other money-market funds. The
possibility that Merrill, Schwab and other financial companies could suddenly
switch large amounts of money into FDIC-insured accounts "raises questions for
the federal deposit insurance system regarding the adequacy of the (insurance)
funds," McFadyen wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   But Ely said he is "a little skeptical that the shift (into insured
accounts) is going to happen that fast."

<HEADLINE> Occidental Shares Fall  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WHITE AP Business Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Shares of Occidental Petroleum Inc. fell nearly 7
percent Monday following reports that the company planned to pay $3.5 billion
for Altura Energy Ltd., an oil and gas production venture jointly owned by BP
Amoco PLC and Royal Dutch Shell AG.
</P>
<P>
	   The purchase would substantially increase Occidental's crude oil and gas
production, but investors were chilled by the price, which would amount to more
than half Occidental's $6.3 billion market value.
</P>
<P>
	   Occidental officials declined to comment on reports by The Wall Street
Journal and others that a deal was in the works. Spokesman for Shell and BP
Amoco did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
</P>
<P>
	   BP Amoco announced last July that it would sell its 64 percent interest in
Altura as part of a plan to unload $10 billion in assets.
</P>
<P>
	   Founded in 1997, Houston-based Altura operates 6,400 wells in western Texas
and southeastern New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
	   Occidental shares fell $1.25 to $17.25 at 4:30 p.m. EST the New York Stock
Exchange.
</P>
<P>
	   "How would they finance a deal of $3.5 billion? They do not have the
financial flexibility," said Fadel Gheit, an oil industry analyst with
Fahnestock &AMP; Co. "Investors are trying to send management a very clear and
strong signal that they are not on the right track," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Reports of the sale come as oil companies are enjoying a sharp rise in
profits on the strength of higher crude oil prices.
</P>
<P>
	   Occidental announced Monday that it will boost capital spending from $600
million to $850 million during 2000, with about three-fourths of the money
earmarked for the oil and gas business.
</P>
<P>
	   Occidental reported fourth-quarter earnings last month of $383 million,
including $192 million before one-time gains. That compares to a loss of $35
million before special items a year earlier. For all of 1999, Occidental
earnings rose to $448 million from $363 in 1998.
</P>
<P>
	   The acquisition would be the second big purchase for Occidental in recent
years. In 1997, the company purchased the 47,000-acre Elk Hills Naval Petroleum
Reserve in California's San Joaquin Valley from the U.S. government for $3.65
billion.
</P>
<P>
	   Occidental would likely have to sell its chemicals division to raise money
to make the purchase, said Gheit. Chemical prices have been in the doldrums
since 1995 and are not expected to rebound for another two years or more,
meaning Occidental would not get the best price for its holdings, he predicted.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Balance With Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Monday the United States has to
strike ``a delicate balance'' in dealing with Austria, voicing disapproval of
Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party without doing ``anything that builds his
support even further.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think it ought to be clear to every Austrian citizen that we in the
United States do not approve of his political program or his excessive
rhetoric,'' Clinton said an interview carried on CNN and on its web page.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said he was optimistic about reviving peace talks in the Middle
East. However, he acknowledged that ``we're in a little tough patch right now''
with a freeze in talks between Israel and Syria, a missed deadline for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace framework, and fresh violence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're down to the hard decisions,'' the president said. He added that
``we're so close on the substance that I am optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
	   The interview ranged from foreign policy to domestic subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that recent hacker attacks against popular Internet sites were
``obviously very disturbing.'' But he said, ``I think there is a way that we can
clearly promote security. I think it's important the American people not
overreact to this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will hold a White House meeting Tuesday with cyber experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Russia, Clinton offered support for Vladimir Putin, the acting
president and head of its government. ``Based on what I have seen so far,''
Clinton said, ``I think that the United States can do business with this man.
... We don't agree with him on everything but what I have seen of him so far
indicates to me that he's capable of being a very strong and effective and
straightforward leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and European Union have isolated Austria because of the
Freedom Party's rise to power. Clinton said the EU has been ``very tough in
condemning what the Austrians have done here. So I think we're on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a delicate balance, however,'' the president continued. ``You

	   ``And we don't want to say or do anything that build his support even
further,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
	   --Said he was trying to help find ``the right balance'' about taxing goods
sold on the Internet. Some governors say states are losing revenue they deserve,
and that stores have to charge state and local sales taxes, while Internet sites
don't. ``You don't want to burden the Internet but you don't want to put people
who aren't making sales on it out of business,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Said, ``I love this job. I don't know if I'll ever do anything again that
I love the work as much as I love this.''

<HEADLINE> 86 Iraq Sanction Opponents Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Police arrested 86 people in front of the U.S. Mission to
the United Nations on Monday after they refused to move during a demonstration
to protest U.N. sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Wake up the children are dying,'' the protesters chanted as they held up
pictures of emaciated Iraqi children and placards reading ``Lift the
sanctions.''
</P>
<P>
	   The demonstrators were charged with disorderly conduct, said police officer
Valerie St. Rose.
</P>
<P>
	   The rally came on the same day U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan accepted
the resignation of the world body's humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, Hans von
Sponeck. Von Sponeck has been a severe critic of sanctions and the U.N. relief
program for Iraqis.
</P>
<P>
	   Iraq has been barred from selling oil, its most precious commodity, on the
open market since U.N. sanctions were imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
Under U.N. resolutions, the sanctions cannot be lifted until Iraq has rid itself
of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Security Council created the oil-for-food program in 1996 to enable
Iraq to sell limited amounts of oil to buy food, medicine and other essential
goods for its people.
</P>
<P>
	   The program, however, has been unable to meet all of the Iraqis' needs, and
U.N. reports consistently speak of high malnutrition rates among Iraqis,
particularly the children.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's rally marked the ninth anniversary of a Persian Gulf War bombing
that Iraq said killed more than 300 civilians. Baghdad has maintained the
building was a civilian shelter, but U.S. officials said they targeted the
structure because it was a military command center.

<HEADLINE> SBC Application Denial Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department recommended Monday that federal
regulators deny a bid by SBC Communications to provide its local customers in
Texas with long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
	   The department, passing its evaluation to the Federal Communications
Commission for the final determination, said the regional Bell company failed to
show it was providing equal access to competing companies seeking to lease its
local phone lines.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 law mandated that before a Bell company can offer long distance
within its service area, it first must show in detail that it has opened up its
local monopoly to give rivals a chance to compete. Bell Atlantic convinced
regulators it had done so in New York, and it became in December the first Bell
company to offer long distance service to its local customers.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio-based SBC filed an application with the FCC in January arguing
that its Texas market also is fully open to competition.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Monday, Justice Department officials said the company had not
demonstrated it was giving the required same access to competitors seeking to
lease lines so they could offer high-speed Internet and phone services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nondiscriminatory access is required for us to find that the market is
open to competition,'' said Joel Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of
the department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also cited problems with SBC's provision of certain
equipment components to competitors that have their own networks.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the FCC has the final say, it must give substantial weight to the
assessment provided by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC previously turned down requests by SBC to provide long-distance
service in Oklahoma and by Ameritech Corp., now owned by SBC, to provide
long-distance service in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's new evaluation comes despite a glowing endorsement
from the Public Utility Commission in Texas, which lent its unanimous support to
the application late last month. The FCC must factor into account this
evaluation by state regulators as well before issuing its final decision no
later than the second week of April.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC asserts that the Texas market is open, with 115 rival companies having
signed up 1.4 million customers in the state. Company officials also have noted
the company has undergone a third-party review to ensure the proper processing
of orders from rivals seeking to switch customers to their service.
</P>
<P>
	   Some competitors who provide local service in the region, including AT&AMP;T and
MCI WorldCom, contend SBC has not passed the necessary hurdles to open its
market to rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also cited precedent established when Bell Atlantic's
New York long-distance application was approved. The department said SBC's
performance in providing rivals with pieces of its network was below the level
the FCC described as ``minimally acceptable'' when it gave Bell Atlantic the
go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic did not receive a full-force endorsement from the Justice
Department, either. In that case, the department suggested the FCC should either
deny the application and clearly identify the steps Bell Atlantic must take to
gain approval or grant an approval contingent on conditions being met. The Bell
company eventually received approval in late December.

<HEADLINE> Feds Satisfied With Meat Plant  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Texas meatpacking plant that the government
unsuccessfully tried to shut down after the facility failed a series of
salmonella tests has implemented new controls that satisfy federal inspectors.
</P>
<P>
	   The Agriculture Department withdrew its inspectors from the Supreme Beef
Processors Inc. plant in Dallas Nov. 30, effectively closing the facility, but
was forced to send them back when a judge granted a temporary restraining order.
</P>
<P>
	   USDA officials said Monday that the plant has modified its pathogen control
plan to prevent salmonella contamination. Inspectors ``will closely monitor the
implementation'' and conduct another round of salmonella testing, said Thomas
Billy, administrator of USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Beef will be allowed to resume sales of ground beef to the federal
school lunch program. Supreme Beef was one of the program's largest suppliers
until USDA cut off purchases at the same time it tried to close the facility.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Beef says that it was not responsible for the salmonella and that
the government had no right to shut it down. The company has no plans to drop a
lawsuit against USDA that is scheduled to go to trial in May, said the firm's
president, Steven F. Spiritas.
</P>
<P>
	   Supreme Beef had agreed to make the changes it is making before USDA tried
to shut the plant down, he said.

<HEADLINE> Dairy Farmers Sue Over Soy Milk  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    WASHINGTON (AP) -- Got milk? Not if it's made from soy, dairy farmers say.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Milk Producers Federation filed a complaint with the Food and
Drug Administration on Monday to stop beverages made from soybeans from being
called soy milk. Under FDA standards, milk is the product of a cow.
</P>
<P>
	   "Soy-based beverages ... are attempting to directly compete with dairy
products, and are inappropriately taking advantage of the familiarity and
positive image of dairy terminology in their labeling," the dairy producers
group wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   The producers acknowledged that the juice from coconuts is known as "milk"
and that the use of the term for the product of goats and other animals is "well
established."
</P>
<P>
	   A spokesman for the American Soybean Association, Bob Callanan, said the
group would look into the dairy farmers' complaint. "We're not aware of any
consumer confusion between cow's milk and soy milk," he said.

<HEADLINE> ABA Debates Nonlawyer Partnerships  </HEADLINE>
    By RICHARD CARELLI Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   DALLAS (AP) -- The American Bar Association, trying to avoid both rushing to
judgment and dragging its heels, is struggling to decide whether it backs
letting lawyers join accountants and other professionals in offering clients
one-stop shopping for a variety of services.
</P>
<P>
	   Efforts to forge a coherent policy consumed much of the ABA's six-day
national convention that ended Monday, but a resolution is not expected before
August at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
	   "This may well be the most important issue confronting the profession for
several decades," ABA President William Paul said at the start of a three-hour
"town meeting" Sunday at which an overflow crowd in attendance and those
watching a live Internet broadcast offered comments and questioned experts.
</P>
<P>
	   The so-called multidiscipline practices also were topics of several other
convention programs.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger of law firms with other professionals such as accountants,
psychologists and social workers is barred in most states by ethical provisions
that mirror an ABA model rule. But the phenomenon of financial service companies
employing lawyers, especially the Big Five accounting firms, is growing in many
countries.
</P>
<P>
	   When doing business in the United States, those lawyers sometimes find
themselves in a gray legal area.
</P>
<P>
	   Many lawyers view the spread of such mergers as inevitable, but ABA leaders
worry about who is going to control them. And a big initial hurdle is the
long-standing ban on lawyers' forming partnerships and sharing fees with
nonlawyers.
</P>
<P>
	   While admitting that dropping the ban may make legal services more
accessible for many consumers, ABA leaders also worry over how to protect
lawyers' independent judgment and confidential client information and avoid
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
	   Citing those problems, the ABA's House of Delegates, which makes policy for
the 400,000-member association, put off last August a vote on the rule change.
</P>
<P>
	   By a 305-118 vote Monday, the delegates passed a resolution urging lawyers
nationwide help state regulators of the profession to enforce ethical rules more
actively against the unauthorized practice of law.
</P>
<P>
	   Cleveland, Ohio, lawyer Leslie Jacobs, a prime backer of the resolution,
said current enforcement is "the equivalent of a tax system with no IRS. What we
have is a network of scofflaws who are simply being ignored."
</P>
<P>
	   The vote came after several unsuccessful attempts to narrow the resolution's
target to nonlawyers and carve out exceptions for multidiscipline practices and
lawyers whose practices encompass more than one state.
</P>
<P>
	   Even if the ABA eventually changes its model ethics rule, each state would
have to follow suit before the cloud of illegality would be removed from such
mergers.
</P>
<P>
	   The ABA's preference for keeping lawyers in charge of any type of business
that includes giving legal advice is called by Albert Foer, president of the
American Antitrust Institute, "nothing more than an effort to protect lawyers
and law firms from competition."
</P>
<P>
	   "I find it sad that so many members of the legal profession are apparently
intent on denying consumers access to much-needed legal services," Foer said.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Sam Sheppard's Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Three decades after Dr. Sam Sheppard's death, DNA evidence
will help clear his name once and for all in the 1954 slaying of his wife, a
lawyer told a jury Monday as the case that inspired TV's ``The Fugitive'' began
unfolding in court all over again.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors countered that Sheppard probably beat his wife to death because
he was an unfaithful husband enraged at being trapped in his marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know what lit the match, but something caused the powder keg of
marital conflict to blow early on the morning of July 4,'' Cuyahoga County
Prosecutor William Mason said in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Reese Sheppard, the doctor's son, is suing the state, claiming his
father was wrongfully imprisoned for killing his mother at the family home on
Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that inspired the movie and TV series ``The Fugitive,'' the doctor
initially was convicted of murder and spent a decade in prison. But the U.S.
Supreme Court overturned the verdict because of the effects of pretrial
publicity on jurors and witnesses. Sheppard was acquitted at a retrial in 1966
and died four years later.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor insisted all along that a bushy-haired intruder killed his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   During his opening statement, Sheppard attorney Terry Gilbert said that DNA
evidence, ``a powerful new tool,'' will show through recently discovered blood
samples that someone other than the Sheppards bled in the bedroom where she was
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are here to prove once and for all that Dr. Sheppard was innocent of
the murder of his wife,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert also said he will try to show that Richard Eberling, a former window
washer for the Sheppards, is the most likely suspect. Eberling died in 1998
while serving a life sentence for another murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer argued that Sheppard was a victim of a rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes things go very, very wrong and lives are ruined. When the state
makes a mistake it should be held accountable,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard's lawyer at his second trial, F. Lee Bailey, was the Sheppard
team's first witness. He said he recently learned about evidence prosecutors
withheld from him, including a flashlight that could have been the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   For the younger Sheppard to win the case, six members of the eight-member
jury must decide that the majority of evidence indicates the doctor was
innocent. The younger Sheppard then could claim damages in a separate court
action.
</P>
<P>
	   In their opening statement, prosecutors said the Sheppards' marriage was
badly strained by the doctor's repeated and widely known extramarital affairs.
The weekend of her murder, Mrs. Sheppard was angry with her husband because a
house guest had been speaking about one of the doctor's lovers openly, they
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors argued that the nature of Mrs. Sheppard's death -- she was
hit 27 times on the head and face with a blunt object -- indicate the actions of
someone in a rage, not a sexual assailant or a burglar.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason made his point by pounding some rolled-up paper into his hand and
counting the blows up to 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Steve Dever said Eberling was set up as the ``fall guy'' in the
early 1990s by Cynthia Cooper, who wrote a book about the case with Sam Reese
Sheppard. Cooper wanted to sell books and using Eberling as alternative suspect
made that task easier, Dever said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey suggested in 1966 that the Sheppards' neighbor Esther Houk might have
delivered the fatal blows after catching her husband, Spencer Houk, having sex
with Mrs. Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
	   When Dever pressed him on the theory during cross-examination, Bailey said
he knew of Eberling but did not consider him a likely suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to DNA analysis, other technology that wasn't available at the
time of the previous two trials will play a role in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert used video footage from Sheppard's first trial in 1954 and slides to
illustrate his points, while prosecutors used a computer-generated model to give
a virtual representation of the path the doctor claimed to have taken the
morning of the murder.

<HEADLINE> Deadline Looms for Examiner Sale  </HEADLINE>
    By MICHAEL WARREN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- The end could come soon for the San Francisco
Examiner, the Hearst Corp.'s 112-year-old flagship newspaper, which has been up
for sale since August with no apparent bidders.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst said it will accept offers for the afternoon paper through Tuesday.
If no viable bidder materializes, it plans to close the paper and merge its
staff and resources into the morning San Francisco Chronicle, which Hearst is
buying.
</P>
<P>
	   All moves are on hold pending a Justice Department inquiry into Hearst's
$660 million purchase of the Examiner's storied rival, which critics say will
leave the Chronicle with a monopoly as the only daily newspaper in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
	   Hearst wouldn't comment Monday on its self-imposed deadline, or say whether
the company had received any viable bids for the Examiner in the weeks since
Hearst sweetened the offer by including the paper's office building, one of its
printing plants and some delivery trucks in the sale.
</P>
<P>
	   "There's no news at present," Debra Shriver, Hearst Corp.'s chief
communications officer in New York, said Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   If Tuesday passes without a viable bid, Hearst can say that the paper it has
published continually since 1880 is an unprofitable failure, and that closing it
now will not violate antitrust law.
</P>
<P>
	   A spokeswoman at the Justice Department in Washington, Jennifer Rose, also
wouldn't comment Monday, other than to say that the department's investigation
is ongoing.
</P>
<P>
	   Ted Fang, publisher of The Independent, a free paper that comes out three
times a week in the city, has been mentioned as a potential bidder. Fang didn't
return a call requesting comment Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Knight Ridder CEO Tony Ridder has expressed interest, but only if Hearst
also sells the Examiner's share of the papers' combined business operations as
outlined in their Joint Operating Agreement, which is set to expire in 2005.
</P>
<P>
	   Since 1965, the papers have shared revenue and expenses for printing,
advertising and circulation while maintaining separate editorial staffs. They
have split the profits 50-50, a boon to the afternoon paper, whose circulation
has declined to 107,129. The Chronicle's circulation is 456,742.
</P>
<P>
	   With the Examiner's share of the JOA, a buyer would have five years to make
the paper profitable and prepare for the head-to-head competition that would
come when the agreement expires. Without it, buying the Examiner would surely be
a money-losing proposition, Ridder and other media experts have said.
</P>
<P>
	   Another potential roadblock for the Hearst Corp. is former mayoral candidate
Clint Reilly's lawsuit seeking to block its purchase of the Chronicle. A hearing
is set for March 7 in federal court.

<HEADLINE> Russia Finds Booster Rocket  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian search teams found an experimental booster rocket that
was launched into space and came back to Earth last week, but a dummy satellite
along for the ride was still missing, the Interfax news agency said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The experimental Russian booster, called Fregat, was designed to put
payloads higher into orbit. It was launched Feb. 9 from the Baikonur cosmodrome
in Kazakstan, successfully changing altitude four times and separating from the
satellite.
</P>
<P>
	   But the booster and the satellite disappeared as they returned to Earth
shortly afterward because their radio beacons malfunctioned. A snowstorm also
hindered efforts to find them.
</P>
<P>
	   Search teams in Russia's Orenburg region, which borders Kazakstan about 800
miles southeast of Moscow, found the Fregat unit in tact Monday, Interfax cited
the Russian Aerospace Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
	   But the satellite, also believed to have landed in Orenburg, remained
missing, Interfax said.
</P>
<P>
	   Still, officials said the fact that both the satellite and the booster had
returned to Earth at all meant a second experiment in the launch was a success:
Both were equipped with new devices called aerobrakes, which inflate and protect
their cargoes from burning up in the atmosphere and ensure soft landing.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Rights Group To Back Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A powerful abortion rights group will endorse Vice
President Al Gore, who has been criticized by his Democratic presidential rival
Bill Bradley for his mixed record on abortion early in his political career.
</P>
<P>
	   The endorsement by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League gives Gore a boost on what's been one of his most vulnerable issues in
his nomination contest with Bradley, a former New Jersey senator. NARAL
president Kate Michelman planned to deliver the endorsement Tuesday in
Washington, said Will Lutz, a spokesman for the group.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates have been battling to attract core Democratic voters,
from blacks to women, where Gore holds a strong lead over Bradley, according to
national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   To that end, the vice president has been aggressively soliciting
endorsements with groups such as NARAL that had hoped to remain neutral in the
Democratic contest. Gore wrung a similar endorsement for his candidacy last week
from the Human Rights Campaign, a large gay rights group.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Michelman has said that both Gore and Bradley are reliable
supporters of abortion rights. She has also said she is confident in Gore's
support for abortion rights now, even though he cast a series of anti-abortion
votes when he was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion has often been an issue in the Republican presidential primaries,
with candidates trying to prove they are sufficiently against abortion. But
rarely has the issue divided Democrats running for office.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has said that he's always been pro-choice and always believed abortion
should be legal, saying he only had reservations about government funding for
abortions for poor women in Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the details of his record emerged, he was forced to admit that his
position has changed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, he said in a letter to a constituent that abortion was ``arguably
the taking of a human life.'' And in 1984, he voted to define the word
``person'' under four existing civil rights laws to include ``unborn children
from the moment of conception.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Right to Life Committee gave Gore an 84 percent approval rating
for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the House. By contrast, NARAL rated
Gore's House career decidedly ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has tried to capitalize on the issue. He ran a TV ad in New
Hampshire calling himself the only presidential candidate who ``has been
pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has responded with a slew of endorsements from feminist leaders and
women in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's front-runner position has been solidified since his
victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, but his camp is working hard to not just
beat Bradley but claim victory by as large a margin as possible.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Pay Tribute to Schulz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The astronauts aboard space shuttle Endeavour
took time out from their Earth-mapping mission to pay tribute to ``Peanuts''
creator Charles Schulz, calling him ``a good space supporter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mission Control informed the six astronauts of the cartoonist's death over
the weekend and, late Sunday, awakened the three working the overnight shift
with a recording of the piano music from the Charlie Brown television shows.
</P>
<P>
	   Endeavour's pilot, Dominic Gorie, called Schulz ``a good space supporter.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's made millions of people laugh and smile for the past 50 years and, of
course, all those folks who have worked with NASA know he's near and dear to
us,'' Gorie said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gorie noted that the Apollo 10 command module was named Charlie Brown and
the lunar module Snoopy. The spacecraft flew to the moon in May 1969, but did
not land. It was the last dress rehearsal for the Apollo 11 moon landing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that as we're flying down over you guys on the Earth, he's looking
from up above on us,'' Gorie said.

<HEADLINE> Storm's Wounded Overwhelm Hospital  </HEADLINE>
   By ERIN McCLAM Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Confused mothers begged nurses to find their children
and frantically scanned the hospital halls filled with injured people slumped
against walls and in chairs.
</P>
<P>
	   In the hours after deadly tornadoes ripped through southwest Georgia early
Monday, tiny Mitchell County Hospital -- the only medical facility within 30
miles -- looked like a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
	   There were four times as many wounded patients as beds, overwhelming the
handful of doctors and nurses working the late-night shift.
</P>
<P>
	   The hospital lost its water connection and, for several terrifying minutes
before a generator kicked in, its power supply.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was absolutely the worst thing I've ever seen,'' said Cara Tyson, the
hospital's assistant director of nursing, who fought blinding rain to reach the
hospital. ``It was a disaster -- people were crying, children were hurt. It was
like a battlefield.''
</P>
<P>
	   Nurses set up a triage system, with the most severe wounds getting attention
first. Those with major trauma eventually were sent to other hospitals better
equipped to handle them.
</P>
<P>
	   One elderly woman waited hours with a gash down her forehead, letting
seriously injured storm victims go before her for treatment.
</P>
<P>
	   Spokesman Rick Ivey said 120 patients were treated at the hospital.
</P>
<P>
	   Monday's storms smashed mobile homes and overturned cars across a swath of
rural southwest Georgia. At least 22 people were killed -- 14 in Mitchell County
-- and more than 100 were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   When the storms rolled through shortly after midnight, hospital
administrator Ron Gilliard and his wife huddled in their bathroom. They said a
prayer, then he drove to pick up a cousin, whose face was badly cut, and drove
to work.
</P>
<P>
	   ``When I got here, there were bodies all over this hospital,'' Gilliard
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of people were in the streets around the small, brick building when
clinical assistant Faye Carroll arrived at 2 a.m. Some were wounded and in
shock, others frantically searched for relatives.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll cleared a path for ambulances and went inside.
</P>
<P>
	   Amid the commotion, relatives told Carroll her nephew had been killed in the
storm. Still, she worked more than 14 hours without a break.
</P>
<P>
	   By 4 a.m., hospital officials had called in all the staff they could find.
Gilliard, not having heard from the hospital's on-call pastor, thumbed through
the phone book to find one.
</P>
<P>
	   People who live in Camilla and surrounding small towns were still waiting in
the hospital Monday, looking for information on missing friends and family.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We count on babies having ear infections, people having heart attacks. But
not this,'' Ivey said.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill 22 in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early Monday,
ripping people from their beds and piling up mobile homes. At least 22 people
were killed and more than 100 were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of houses and mobile homes in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla
were flattened, their metal and siding mangled and strewn across yards and
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All you heard was a roar, woo-woo-woo,'' said Johnny Jones, whose mobile
home south of Camilla was thrown on its side. He said he freed his 14-year-old
son, who was pinned under a washing machine, and they crawled out a window.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I could see was that everything was demolished. People were hollering
and crying `Where's my child?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tornadoes struck shortly after midnight as a line of thunderstorms
rumbled through the Southeast, scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia.
Authorities in Camilla and surrounding Mitchell County said two separate
twisters cut a 1.5-mile-wide, 10-mile-long path through the county.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hit the impoverished and the affluent,'' said Liz McQueen, a Red Cross
volunteer who was working at a temporary morgue near Camilla.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen people died in Mitchell County, a primarily rural area dotted with
cotton and peanut farms, chicken processing plants, textile factories and a
state prison. Gov. Roy Barnes, who flew over the area to assess the damage,
declared Mitchell and three other counties disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The twisters were the deadliest in Georgia since 1936, when 203 people were
killed by tornadoes in Gainesville, northeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds snatched up the trailer where Janet and James Madeiras and their
son Travis, 12, had been sleeping, tossing them out and knocking the trailer on
top of them.
</P>
<P>
	   James Madeiras, 60, said they had just seconds to react. ``The moment I
heard it, the bed dropped down and the walls came tumbling down on top of us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was saying, `Oh my God!' and started digging,'' Janet Madeiras said.
``When I got outside and looked around, everything was gone. You could hear
moaning and crying.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family escaped without major injuries and moved into a shelter with
several neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Families of the injured and missing jammed phone lines and scrambled into
hospitals to find their loved ones. There were so many injuries, people were
sent to hospitals as far away as Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell County Hospital, with only 33 beds, was swamped with more than 120
injured people early Monday. The storms had knocked out power, and the small
staff of doctors and nurses worked under backup power from a generator, trying
to treat the wounded and find other hospitals to handle the overflow.
</P>
<P>
	   At Archbold Memorial Hospital in Thomasville, a lost 4-year-old girl was at
first too terrified to tell doctors her name. Her mother hadn't been found
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary assessment found 198 structures destroyed and more than 160
damaged, said Ed Tynes, supervisor of a Red Cross shelter in the gymnasium of
the Mitchell County Middle School. More than 5,000 people were without power.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani steps up campaign pace  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Stepping up his campaign pace, Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani on Monday made his fourth political stop in five days outside New York
City as he continued to criticize his Senate rival's husband, President Clinton.
<P>
	   "A president who is so famous for feeling our pain, somehow doesn't feel the
pain of New Yorkers," Giuliani told a news conference after meeting privately
with state Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
	   It was a replay of the mayor's criticism Saturday that the president has
refused to dip into the nation's strategic oil reserves in the face of sharply
rising fuel oil costs.
</P>
<P>
	   "Frankly, if he's not going to feel our pain, maybe if we create enough
political pain, he'll finally act ... We've found that sometimes if you make
something political with this president, he pays more attention," the mayor
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani and Hillary Rodham Clinton are competing for the Senate seat being
vacated this year by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan.
</P>
<P>
	   Meanwhile, New York Gov. George Pataki sought to knock down speculation that
he was somehow looking to hurt Giuliani's chances by encouraging U.S. Rep. Rick
Lazio, a Long Island Republican, to renew his interest in the Senate race.
</P>
<P>
	   Lazio, with encouragement of state Conservative Party Chairman Michael Long,
a Pataki ally, has said he is again weighing an entry into the race for the GOP
and Conservative parties' nominations.
</P>
<P>
	   Maintaining he wants Lazio to remain on the sidelines, Pataki said Monday at
a separate news conference that, "I would like to see all Republicans get behind
Mayor Giuliani. I think that's the right thing to do."
</P>
<P>
	   "The governor has been very supportive," Giuliani said at his own news
conference.
</P>
<P>
	   In August, and despite past icy relations with the mayor, Pataki convinced
Lazio to put his possible Senate race plans on hold in favor of Giuliani. But
since then, Long has become increasingly vocal with complaints that Giuliani,
who supports abortion and gay rights, is not conservative enough for
Conservatives. Long has said he is looking for an alternative candidate.
</P>
<P>
	   No Republican has won statewide office in New York since 1974 without having
both the GOP and Conservative ballot lines. Unlike other states, New York allows
votes on third-party lines to count for major party candidates.
</P>
<P>
	   Giuliani's visit to Albany on Monday came in the wake of criticism from some
Republican leaders that he was not paying enough attention to upstate New York,
a critical battleground in his race with the first lady.
</P>
<P>
	   "She's been all over upstate," one upstate GOP leader, speaking on condition
of anonymity, grumbled after Monday's meeting.
</P>
<P>
	   After formally announcing her candidacy on Feb. 6, Clinton set off on a
four-day swing across upstate New York that took her from Buffalo to Albany.
Giuliani held political events in Buffalo on Thursday, suburban Westchester
County on Friday and on Long Island on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Albany, the mayor said he wasn't intentionally stepping up his political
pace.
</P>
<P>
	   "We're doing the best that we can, given the fact that I have
responsibilities as the mayor of New York City," Giuliani said before hurrying
back to the city to perform a Valentine's Day wedding.
</P>
<P>
	   The heating oil issue seemed tailor-made for Giuliani given that the highest
price hikes have come in New York state and the Northeast since the OPEC nations
cut production. Thus far, despite pressure from a bipartisan group that includes
Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, President Clinton has refused to dip
into the oil reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   On Monday, Hillary Clinton said she favored dipping into the reserves with a
swap system under which U.S. oil companies would be able to borrow from the
stockpile and make larger donations back to it at a later date.
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton campaign team also took issue with Giuliani's tactics.
</P>
<P>
	   "Rudy Giuliani won't help New Yorkers afford the high cost of home heating
oil by playing politics and pointing fingers," Clinton campaign spokesman Howard
Wolfson said. "That's not going to solve problems in the Senate."
</P>
<P>
	   Brooke Anderson, a spokeswoman for the Clinton administration's Energy
Department, said Monday that "the administration is not actively considering
using the strategic petroleum reserves in the current context."
</P>
<P>
	   She said the administration has been providing extra money to the poor to
help pay their heating oil bills and is trying to help heating oil distributors
with possible cash-flow problems. She said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson
would be meeting Wednesday in Boston with officials from the heating oil
industry and others to discuss the problem.

<HEADLINE> Defense case begins in drug trial; at least 12 Camden officers  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   CAMDEN, N.J. (AP) - At least a dozen Camden police officers have been
subpoenaed to possibly testify as defense witnesses in the trial of two accused
drug lords, a defense lawyer said Monday.
<P>
	   The prosecution, meanwhile, wrapped up its case Monday, with its star
witness, the second-highest ranking member of the largest cocaine cartel in
Camden's history, completing three days of testimony.
</P>
<P>
	   Jose "JR" Rivera, 40, of Cherry Hill, and Luis "Tun Tun" Figueroa, 34, of
Camden, are accused of conspiring to distribute hundreds of tons of cocaine in
the city. Rivera is also accused of laundering drug profits through his
businesses.
</P>
<P>
	   During the federal trial, in its seventh week, drug dealers have named
current and former city police officers who they said tipped them off to raids
or shook them down for bribes.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities have said the multimillion dollar drug ring flourished in Camden
for nearly a decade, in part, because of its close ties to law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
	   Five convicted drug dealers have testified that Mayor Milton Milan - before
becoming the city's mayor in 1997 - sold drugs and bought bulk quantities of
cocaine from the ring.
</P>
<P>
	   It was unclear what testimony the police officers subpoenaed last week by
Rivera's attorney, Marc Neff, might offer if called when the trial resumes
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   "Wait and see," said Neff.
</P>
<P>
	   Rivera, the accused financier of the drug organization, and Figueroa, the
alleged enforcer, are the only two among 15 defendants charged in the case to
stand trial. Both face life in prison if convicted.
</P>
<P>
	   In other testimony Monday, the prosecution's final witness, Saul "Gordo"
Febo, again admitted his role in the 1993 slaying of a rival drug dealer, but
identified Figueroa as the triggerman.
</P>
<P>
	   Febo, 32, said he had no choice but to go along with the plan when summoned
by Figueroa. Febo said he turned up the volume on the radio to muffle gunshots
fired by Figueroa.
</P>
<P>
	   "I didn't want the guys to think I was a punk," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   In one of the most bizarre moments in the trial, Figueroa's attorney, Carlos
Martir, asked Febo about a tattoo on his stomach - one of 14 he has.
</P>
<P>
	   "You want to see it?" Febo said.
</P>
<P>
	   Febo stood up at the witness stand and pulled up his white T-shirt to
display the arch-shaped message above his navel. It read: "F--- the FBI."
</P>
<P>
	   "Today being Valentine's Day you might want to change it to 'I Love the
FBI,"' bantered Martir.
</P>
<P>
	   "No," replied Febo. "Happy Valentine's Day."
</P>
<P>
	   At least five Camden officers were waiting in the courtroom hallway to be
called to testify. U.S. District Judge Joseph H. Rodriguez sent the jury home in
the mid-afternoon, saying the next witness would not be available until
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Smith said the trial was recessed to allow the
defense time to review a box of documents it received Monday from the
prosecution. The documents are believed to be evidence that could impeach the
credibility of testimony by some of the police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Officer Michael Hearne, a 13-year department veteran, was among the officers
at the courthouse. His attorney, Stanley O. King, said the defense informed him
that they no longer plan to call him as a witness.
</P>
<P>
	   "We really don't know where this is going," King said. "He was just one of
many cops that were called. We don't know, quite honestly, how they plan to use
them."
</P>
<P>
	   Hearne was captured on a tape recording played in the trial allegedly
advising Rivera on how to handle narcotics investigators in June 1997. The
conversation was secretly recorded by a drug dealer-turned informant.
</P>
<P>
	   "Don't do nothing. Don't do nothing," Hearne is heard telling Rivera.
</P>
<P>
	   King said Hearne maintains his innocence and denies any involvement with the
drug organization. Hearne, 35, is still on the police force.
</P>
<P>
	   Authorities said the ring had connections in the police department that
allowed it to keep a step ahead of investigators. Police officers were known to
frequent Rivera's gym in Camden and escort him to the bank to make large
deposits.
</P>
<P>
	   Milan's former police bodyguard has admitted selling Rivera an illegal
assault weapon. Febo testified last week that another police detective once
assigned to the mayor's security detail warned him about raids.
</P>
<P>
	   Camden Police Chief Robert Allenbach has said the allegations against the
officers will be investigated when the trial is over.

<HEADLINE> Henson Siblings Buy New Muppets Home  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Muppets are moving into Charlie Chaplin's old digs.
The five children of Muppets creator Jim Henson said Monday they have bought
Chaplin's historic studio and are leasing it to the Jim Henson Co.
</P>
<P>
	   The Hensons bought the five-acre Hollywood site for $12.5 million and are
renovating it to house the Los Angeles headquarters of their late father's
company. The company, which now is based at the nearby Raleigh Studios, is
expected to move into its new home by mid-April.
</P>
<P>
	   "When we heard that the Chaplin lot was for sale we had to have it," said
Brian Henson, president and chief executive of the Henson company.
</P>
<P>
	   Chaplin began construction on his studio in 1917 near the mansion owned by
his brother, Sydney. The studio opened a year later, and Chaplin filmed large
parts of "The Kid," "The Gold Rush," "Modern Times" and "The Great Dictator"
there.
</P>
<P>
	   The studio changed hands several times after 1953 and was home to such early
television series as "Superman" and "The Red Skelton Show." "Perry Mason" was
produced there, and star Raymond Burr actually lived on the lot.
</P>
<P>
	   The 80,000-square-foot facility most recently was home to A&AMP;M Records, whose
founders Herb Alpert and Jerry Moss bought it in 1966. The A&AMP;M offices were
closed after new owner Universal Music folded it into another record label.
</P>
<P>
	   The site, which includes Chaplin's 10,000-square-foot sound stage, was
declared a historical monument by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Board in
1969, protecting some of its buildings from alteration.
</P>
<P>
	   "The buildings are a lovable hodgepodge of quirky, unusual spaces," said
Lisa Henson, who works with the film division of her father's company. "There
are unexpected elements in some of the offices like original vaults and fish
tank bathrooms. It's not your typical corporate space, but it's ideal for the
Muppets."
</P>
<P>
	   Jim Henson died in 1990. Besides the Muppets movies and television projects,
his company also created the children's series "Sesame Street."

<HEADLINE> Romania Refuses To Pay Spill Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Work crews pulled out tons of dead, rotting
fish from the Tisza and Danube rivers on Monday, and Romania rebuffed
compensation demands from Yugoslavia and Hungary for the gold mine spill that
contaminated the rivers with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania said it, too, suffered damage when a dam at the Australian-owned
Baia Mare gold mine in northwest Romania overflowed Jan. 30, sending cyanide
pouring into streams that eventually carried the poison west. U.S. experts said
the spill rivaled one in the United States that cost $170 million to clean up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania had to suffer the most damage from the polluting company and thus
it is entitled to get compensation as Hungary and Yugoslavia are,'' said Gabriel
Dumitrascu of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia, the larger of two republics in Yugoslavia, banned the sale of most
freshwater fish Monday, and Hungary warned of long-term ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Romanians accused Hungary and Serbia of exaggerating the damage, as did
Brett Montgomery, chairman of the gold mine's owner, Esmeralda Exploration in
Perth, Australia. Montgomery said the accident had been grossly exaggerated and
he expected his company to face no compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing protective gloves, Serbian fishermen on Monday scooped dead fish
from the Danube at the Belgrade suburb of Zemun. Downstream, water pumps were
shut off in the Belgrade area town of Vinca, and authorities announced they
would deliver fresh drinking water by truck as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary and Serbia have demanded that Romania pay compensation for the
damage, and the Serbs have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not
met.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimate of the damage and that the culprits for this
tragedy be punished,'' Serb Environment Minister Bratislav Blazic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union, meanwhile, said it was ready to help Hungary and Romania
deal with the spill and would send its top environment official to assess the
damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Environment Program, after receiving a number of requests, had
asked scientists in the area to take water samples from the Danube, Europe's
longest river, said Executive Director Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the U.S.-based Mineral Policy Center said the Eastern
European spill is comparable in size and environmental impact to the 1992
Summitville mine cyanide spill in southern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alamosa River was badly contaminated when a mine pond holding thousands
of gallons of cyanide-laced water spilled into the river. The pollution killed
all life in 17 miles of the Alamosa River system. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency estimates the Colorado spill will cost $170 million in total
cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're having to re-establish an entire ecosystem,'' said Steve
D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a private group in
Washington, D.C. ``So it takes years, if not decades.''
</P>
<P>
	   The immediate risk to people who live along the rivers could remain high
long after the cyanide diminishes. D'Esposito said cyanide compounds persist in
groundwater and soils, making it necessary to test crops grown nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the short term, most or all aquatic life will die,'' he said. ``It's a
certainty that a multiyear cleanup and remediation process will be required
costing tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cyanide has been used to extract gold from crushed rock for more than 100
years. Modern methods that mix cyanide compounds in a water-based solution can
recover nearly 100 percent of the gold, making it profitable for mining
companies to process much lower-grade ores.
</P>
<P>
	   In the body, the poison works by blocking the transport of oxygen across
cell walls, with the central nervous system being the most sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian officials said 83 tons of dead fish had been removed from the
Tisza since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that heavy metals also got into the rivers means an even worse
problem,'' said Zoltan Illes, chairman of the Hungarian parliament's Environment
Committee. ``It will poison the whole food chain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy metals, widely used in industry, are toxic even in small amounts. They
dissolve in water, and spread through the environment through groundwater and
leach into soils.

<HEADLINE> Astronauts Pay Tribute to Schulz  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- The astronauts aboard space shuttle Endeavour
took time out from their Earth-mapping mission to pay tribute to ``Peanuts''
creator Charles Schulz, calling him ``a good space supporter.''
</P>
<P>
	   Mission Control informed the six astronauts of the cartoonist's death over
the weekend and, late Sunday, awakened the three working the overnight shift
with a recording of the ``Linus and Lucy'' piano theme from the Charlie Brown
Christmas special.
</P>
<P>
	   Endeavour's commander, Kevin Kregel, called Schulz ``a good space
supporter.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``He's made millions of people laugh and smile for the past 50 years and, of
course, all those folks who have worked with NASA know he's near and dear to
us,'' Kregel said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kregel noted that the Apollo 10 command module was named Charlie Brown and
the lunar module Snoopy. The spacecraft flew to the moon in May 1969, but did
not land. It was the last dress rehearsal for the Apollo 11 moon landing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We know that as we're flying down over you guys on the Earth, he's looking
from up above on us,'' Kregel said.

<HEADLINE> Azerbaijan Leader Promises Pipeline  </HEADLINE>
   By DAVID BRISCOE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Azerbaijani President Geidar Aliev promised Monday to
start construction of a U.S.-supported pipeline ``very soon'' and urged more
American help in settling his country's dispute with Armenia.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev pledged to continue a dialogue with Armenian President Robert
Kocharian, while criticizing Russia for maintaining a strong military presence
in Armenia.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The conflict needs to be settle peacefully,'' Aliev said in a speech at
the Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies. He outlined
Azerbaijan's position in the dispute over the future of Nagorno-Karabkh, an
independence-seeking region of Azerbaijan now populated mostly by Armenians.
</P>
<P>
	   On the pipeline that would connect Baku, Azerbaijan, to Supsa, Georgia,
Aliev praised President Clinton's support for making the project possible. U.S.
and European oil companies have contracts to develop deep-sea oil fields in the
Caspian Sea, which has massive reserves but offers limited means of getting the
oil to world markets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will start construction of the Baku-Supsa main export pipeline very
soon,'' Aliev said. He said Azerbaijan also seeks construction of a gas
pipeline.
</P>
<P>
	   As Aliev spoke in an auditorium in downtown Washington, about a dozen
demonstrators stood across the street, chanting and waving signs protesting his
visit. They accused Aliev, a former Soviet leader, of a 40-year record of human
rights abuse, censorship and aggression.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said in his speech that he is committed to democracy and free markets.
</P>
<P>
	   Armenia and Azerbaijan have maintained a cease-fire for five years but have
not been able to settle the status of Nagorno-Karabkh. Aliev said he supports
giving Nagorno-Karabkh ``the highest degree of status'' within Azerbaijan, but
Armenian forces must be withdrawn and Azerbaijanis driven from the region should
be allowed to return.
</P>
<P>
	   Nagorno-Karabkh cannot become a second Armenia, he said, adding, ``The
Armenian people already have a nation.''
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev, who meets with Clinton on Tuesday, said the United States and Russia
must do more to help settle the dispute. He did not specify what steps should be
taken, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Aliev said his main goal in meeting with Kocharian is to achieve peace. He
said both sides have indicated a willingness to compromise but have not been
able to reach a comprehensive settlement, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Kocharian and Aliev last met in Davos, Switzerland, in January and have
scheduled another round of talks in Vienna under the joint supervision of the
United States, Russia and France, which head a large group of nations seeking a
settlement in the southern Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
	   The dispute has produced up to 1 million refugees and an instability that
U.S. officials fear could hamper plans to open the strategically important new
oil pipeline.

<HEADLINE> Opposition Takes Lead in Zimbabwe  </HEADLINE>
   By ANGUS SHAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) -- President Robert Mugabe appeared to struggle Monday
in early results of a constitutional referendum seen as a barometer of the
Zimbabwe leader's waning popularity.
</P>
<P>
	   With 50 of 120 voting districts counted from the weekend vote, 32 opposed
changes to the constitution that would allow Mugabe to retain most of his
powers. Supporters of the Mugabe-backed constitution won in just 18 districts.
</P>
<P>
	   The constitutional changes also would allow the government to seize land
owned by white descendants of British settlers without paying compensation.
</P>
<P>
	   If the trend were to continue, it will result in the biggest vote against
Mugabe and his ruling party since he led the former British colony of Rhodesia
to independence as Zimbabwe in 1980. His party has dominated past elections with
landslide victories.
</P>
<P>
	   An economic crisis has spurred the biggest opposition challenge to Mugabe's
ruling party since independence.
</P>
<P>
	   Jonathan Moyo, chief spokesman for the state-appointed Constitutional
Commission which rewrote the constitution, said he was surprised by the level of
opposition.
</P>
<P>
	   Polling appeared for the first time to break the ruling party's traditional
domination and was a lesson to ruling party lawmakers ahead of national
Parliament elections scheduled early April, he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mugabe's party holds 147 seats in the 150-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
	   The National Constitutional Assembly, an alliance of political opposition,
civic and church groups opposed to the Mugabe-approved constitution, said its
monitors at counting posts in Harare and Bulawayo reported a 70 percent ``no''
vote in initial counting.
</P>
<P>
	   Independent monitors provided by civic groups and churches reached only 65
percent of the 3,600 voting stations countrywide because of the late
announcement on Friday by the state Elections Directorate of each voting
location.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill 22 in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early Monday,
ripping people from their beds and piling up mobile homes. At least 22 people
were killed and more than 100 were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of houses and mobile homes in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla
were flattened, their metal and siding mangled and strewn across yards and
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All you heard was a roar, woo-woo-woo,'' said Johnny Jones, whose mobile
home south of Camilla was thrown on its side. He said he freed his 14-year-old
son, who was pinned under a washing machine, and they crawled out a window.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I could see was that everything was demolished. People were hollering
and crying `Where's my child?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tornadoes struck shortly after midnight as a line of thunderstorms
rumbled through the Southeast, scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia.
Authorities in Camilla and surrounding Mitchell County said two separate
twisters cut a 1.5-mile-wide, 10-mile-long path through the county.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hit the impoverished and the affluent,'' said Liz McQueen, a Red Cross
volunteer who was working at a temporary morgue near Camilla.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen people died in Mitchell County, a primarily rural area dotted with
cotton and peanut farms, chicken processing plants, textile factories and a
state prison. Seven people died in neighboring Grady County and one in Colquitt
County. Gov. Roy Barnes, who flew over to assess the damage, declared those
three counties and nearby Tift County disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
	   The twisters were the deadliest in Georgia since 1936, when 203 people were
killed by tornadoes in Gainesville, northeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds snatched up the trailer where Janet and James Madeiras and their
son Travis, 12, had been sleeping, tossing them out and knocking the trailer on
top of them.
</P>
<P>
	   James Madeiras, 60, said they had just seconds to react. ``The moment I
heard it, the bed dropped down and the walls came tumbling down on top of us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was saying, `Oh my God!' and started digging,'' Janet Madeiras said.
``When I got outside and looked around, everything was gone. You could hear
moaning and crying.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family escaped without major injuries and moved into a shelter with
several neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Families of the injured and missing jammed phone lines and scrambled into
hospitals to find their loved ones. There were so many injuries, people were
sent to hospitals as far away as Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell County Hospital, with only 33 beds, was swamped with more than 120
injured people early Monday. The storms had knocked out power, and the small
staff of doctors and nurses worked under backup power from a generator, trying
to treat the wounded and find other hospitals to handle the overflow.
</P>
<P>
	   At Archbold Memorial Hospital in Thomasville, a lost 4-year-old girl was at
first too terrified to tell doctors her name. Her mother hadn't been found
Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary assessment found 198 structures destroyed and more than 160
damaged, said Ed Tynes, supervisor of a Red Cross shelter in the gymnasium of
the Mitchell County Middle School. More than 5,000 people were without power.

<HEADLINE> SBC Application Denial Sought  </HEADLINE>
   By KALPANA SRINIVASAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Justice Department recommended Monday that federal
regulators deny a bid by SBC Communications to provide its local customers in
Texas with long-distance telephone service.
</P>
<P>
	   The department, passing its evaluation to the Federal Communications
Commission for the final determination, said the regional Bell company failed to
show it was providing equal access to competing companies seeking to lease its
local phone lines.
</P>
<P>
	   A 1996 law mandated that before a Bell company can offer long distance
within its service area, it first must show in detail that it has opened up its
local monopoly to give rivals a chance to compete. Bell Atlantic convinced
regulators it had done so in New York, and it became in December the first Bell
company to offer long distance service to its local customers.
</P>
<P>
	   San Antonio-based SBC filed an application with the FCC in January arguing
that its Texas market also is fully open to competition.
</P>
<P>
	   But on Monday, Justice Department officials said the company had not
demonstrated it was giving the required same access to competitors seeking to
lease lines so they could offer high-speed Internet and phone services.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Nondiscriminatory access is required for us to find that the market is
open to competition,'' said Joel Klein, assistant attorney general in charge of
the department's antitrust division.
</P>
<P>
	   Although the FCC has the final say, it must give substantial weight to the
assessment provided by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
	   The FCC previously turned down requests by SBC to provide long-distance
service in Oklahoma and by Ameritech Corp., now owned by SBC, to provide
long-distance service in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department's new evaluation comes despite a glowing endorsement
from the Public Utility Commission in Texas, which lent its unanimous support to
the application late last month. The FCC must factor into account this
evaluation by state regulators as well before issuing its final decision no
later than the second week of April.
</P>
<P>
	   SBC said Monday that it was confident the FCC would eventually approve the
application. The company has already created a separate subsidiary to handle its
high-speed Internet service, ensuring nondiscriminatory access for rivals, SBC
said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Addressing another Justice Department concern, the Bell company said that
its performance level for moving local customers to competitors without an
interruption of phone service meets or exceeds the standards set by Bell
Atlantic when it received FCC approval.
</P>
<P>
	   Some competitors who provide local service in the region, including AT&AMP;T and
MCI WorldCom, contend SBC has not passed the necessary hurdles to open its
market to rivals.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also cited precedent established when Bell Atlantic's
New York long-distance application was approved. The department said SBC's
performance in providing rivals with pieces of its network was below the level
the FCC described as ``minimally acceptable'' when it gave Bell Atlantic the
go-ahead.
</P>
<P>
	   Bell Atlantic did not receive a full-force endorsement from the Justice
Department, either. In that case, the department suggested the FCC should either
deny the application and clearly identify the steps Bell Atlantic must take to
gain approval or grant an approval contingent on conditions being met. The Bell
company eventually received approval in late December.

<HEADLINE> Reform Party Pushes for Stability  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURIE KELLMAN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a weekend of ``wrestlemania,'' Reform Party leaders
faced an uncertain future, trying to build instant stability for a presidential
campaign that could be led by former Republican Pat Buchanan or party founder
Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
	   There was even talk Monday of John McCain -- talk he didn't reject, as long
as it was clear he'd consider the Reform Party only after he had won the
Republican nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   The party's newly installed leaders said their free-for-all meeting in
Nashville, Tenn., had been ``cathartic,'' a rightful uprising against
figureheads hostile to Perot's vision of reform.
</P>
<P>
	   With Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, his hand-picked national party chairman
Jack Gargan and potential presidential candidate Donald Trump suddenly out, the
organization was returned overnight to stability, Perot's allies said.
</P>
<P>
	   Others said the nationally televised melee had dealt a major blow.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think people are laughing at us,'' Alabama chairman Jim Turpin, who
attended the meeting, said by telephone from his home near Birmingham, Ala.
``I'm having second thoughts; I'm thinking about going with another party, an
independent party.''
</P>
<P>
	   But no other political organization outside the Republican and Democratic
parties will have $12.6 million in federal matching funds to give a presidential
candidate, nor such potential to influence the election this year, Reform
leaders said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The party's under control,'' declared newly installed National Chairman
Pat Choate. ``The sideshow is over.''
</P>
<P>
	   But news shows on Monday still were airing footage of red-faced party
members shouting each other down over the weekend in Nashville while police
officers separated them. The pictures, some critics said, dealt major damage to
the Reform Party's credibility in national politics.
</P>
<P>
	   The leadership shakeup prompted new speculation over what's next for the
third political party.
</P>
<P>
	   Perot has yet to rule out running for a third time. And Buchanan has been
campaigning for months in a cross-country marathon to qualify for the ballots in
29 states.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan said Monday that the party dispute would not hurt his candidacy,
and he predicted the turmoil would actually help the party in the long run.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I think the internal warfare inside the party is now over. Two weeks from
now, a month from now, that's going to be ancient history,'' he said during a
campaign stop in West Columbia, S.C.
</P>
<P>
	   Buchanan said he thought Choate, the newly installed chairman, ``can bring
peace to the party.'' He also said he was pleased that Ventura and Trump were
out of the way, and added that the possibility of another White House run by
Perot would not deter him.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Clearly, he would be a formidable challenger for the nomination. There's
no question about it,'' Buchanan said of Perot. '' But we would go right ahead
with our campaign for the nomination ....''
</P>
<P>
	   Asked on Monday why Buchanan, the staunchly conservative, anti-abortion
commentator, would make a good match for the socially moderate party, Choate
said Buchanan would fit because he agrees with the rest of the party platform on
such issues as trade and campaign finance reform.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He has a personal belief on the issue of abortion. We understand where he
is, he understands where we are and we accept his position,'' Choate said.
</P>
<P>
	   Speculation had also begun about whether disenchanted Reform Party members
could find a reason to nominate a Republican like McCain, or vote for him if he
wins the GOP nomination.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He sounds more like a Reform Party candidate than anyone else running,''
said Rhode Island chairman Victor Moffitt. ``He would be a perfect candidate for
our party.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, in South Carolina, said he was sticking with the Republicans. But
when asked if he would accept the nomination of the Reform Party, he replied:
``Sure I would, as long as they know I'm the nominee of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I wouldn't seek their nomination if I were not the Republican nominee,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain added, after the weekend's Reform events on TV: ``I reach out to
everybody, although from watching 'Headline News,' I'm not sure who you'd be
reaching out to.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``Those images are not particularly helpful to the prestige of the party or
an institution,'' said Stephen Wayne, an expert on political parties who teaches
at Georgetown University.
</P>
<P>
	   And fireworks continued flying between Ventura's and Perot's supporters,
with Trump announcing he would not seek the party's presidential nomination in
part because ``the Reform Party is a total mess.''
</P>
<P>
	   There also was still the question of where more than $2 million of the
party's money, intended for its nominating convention, had gone. Choate said his
attorneys were ``on the case.'' Legal action was still pending over the location
of the party's financial books, which ousted national treasurer Ronn Young had
sued to recover.
</P>
<P>
	   The political explosions started Friday when Ventura, who had been the
party's only major office-holder, disaffiliated himself and branded the group
``dysfunctional.''

<HEADLINE> Sobbing police officer recounts Diallo shooting  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - One of the police officers who killed Amadou Diallo
in a barrage of 41 bullets broke into tears Monday as he testified he was
convinced Diallo was about to shoot his partner.
<P>
	   In his first public account of the shooting of the unarmed West African
immigrant, Sean Carroll told jurors that he opened fire after seeing a black
object emerge from Diallo's right pocket. It turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   "Believing that he had just pulled and was about to fire a gun at my
partner, I fired my weapon," said Carroll before taking off his glasses and
weeping at the murder trial of four police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll claimed he kept shooting into the vestibule of Diallo's Bronx
apartment building because another plainclothes officer, Edward McMellon, fell
down - and because Diallo did not. He said he became convinced the victim stayed
on his feet because he was "wearing a bulletproof vest ... and that he didn't
want to go to jail."
</P>
<P>
	   After Diallo finally dropped, Carroll said he was stunned to discover there
was no gun.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was just a wallet," he said. "I said, 'Where's the (expletive) gun?"'
</P>
<P>
	   Though Diallo was hit 19 times, he was still breathing, Carroll said. "I
held his hand and rubbed his face" and pleaded: "Please, don't die."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, and McMellon, 27, were the first officers to testify about how
the four officers - all white - confronted the black victim and shot him as they
patrolled his block at 12:40 a.m. on Feb. 4, 1999. Officers Kenneth Boss, 28,
and Richard Murphy, 27, also are expected to take the stand Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants - who refused to testify before a grand jury last year - have
pleaded innocent to second-degree murder. If convicted, they face a maximum
sentence of 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon both told jurors they had experience identifying
dangerous street criminals, and were trained to quickly move in - or "close the
gap" - to disarm them. Both testified they had been involved in non-fatal
shootings that were deemed justified.
</P>
<P>
	   On the morning Diallo died, the four officers were cruising in an unmarked
car. Carroll said he became suspicious as they drove past Diallo's building and
saw him "looking up and down the block, peeking his head out ... like he didn't
want to be seen."
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll claimed Diallo, 22, a street vendor, fit the general description of
a serial rapist he and his partners were seeking. He also said he suspected that
he might be committing a robbery.
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon testified he held out his badge and said, "Police Department ...
Can we have a word with you?" Instead of stopping, Diallo retreated to his
vestibule and started digging in his right pocket, both officers testified.
</P>
<P>
	   The defendants described rushing Diallo, ordering him to "Stop!" and "Show
your hands!"
</P>
<P>
	   "We said it clear," Carroll said. "He just didn't want to listen."
</P>
<P>
	   The officers said Diallo turned toward them and began pulling out a square
black object that looked like the top of a semi-automatic pistol.
</P>

	   "My prior arrests dictated to me that this person was pulling a gun,"
Carroll said. "I just said, 'Gun. He's got a gun."'
</P>
<P>
	   Said McMellon: "I screamed 'What are you doing?' (at Diallo) ... I didn't
want to die."
</P>
<P>
	   Both officers said they had one foot in the 5-by-7-foot vestibule when they
fired the first shots. As they retreated, McMellon fell down a stoop and unto
his back, but kept firing.

<P>
	   Carroll and McMellon repeated defense claims that they fired all 16 shots
from their rapid-fire pistols because Diallo did not immediately go down.
Carroll denied he shot Diallo while he was flat on his back, despite evidence
that one of his bullets tunneled up the victim's leg.

<P>
	   On cross-examination, both officers said they didn't know which one of them
fired the first shot. Prosecutor Donald Levin Carroll demanded Carroll explain

the officer.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Hostages Return Home  </HEADLINE>
   By AMIR SHAH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   KANDAHAR, Afghanistan (AP) -- Dozens of former hostages -- about half the
passengers aboard a hijacked jetliner -- returned home Monday to a hero's
welcome, kissing the sandy soil of Afghanistan and accepting chocolates and
turbans from a waiting official.
</P>
<P>
	   Embracing the Taliban's Foreign Minister Wakil Ahmed Muttawakil, they gave
thanks for their safe return and an end to the ordeal that began Feb. 6 in the
Afghan capital, Kabul, and ended in Britain.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This is my home. I love it very much,'' said Juma Khan, who stepped off
the aircraft and kissed the ground.
</P>
<P>
	   At the airport in southern Kandahar, Muttawakil greeted the 73 returning
passengers with an embrace and a new shalwar kameez, the traditional Afghan
dress. He gave turbans to some of the men but in keeping with the Taliban's
strict interpretation of Islam there was no contact with women disembarking from
the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
	   On board Monday were 60 adults and 13 children, including the 10 crew
members of the Ariana Airlines plane hijacked on a flight to the northern city
of Mazar-e-Sharif.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammed Ibrahim, one of the returning passengers, said the ordeal was a
horrific one as the aircraft made a series of stops before landing in Britain on
Feb. 7.
</P>
<P>
	   He said some of the hostages were beaten. ``They were with their families.
They only wanted to go to Britain, to leave Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
	   Despite assurances from Muttawakil that the passengers were welcome to
return and would face no punishment, 74 passengers remain in Britain and have
sought asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Muttawakil urged Britain to reject the requests, saying granting them asylum
would encourage hijacking. He said the asylum seekers are not political refugees
but economic ones, trying to leave a country ravaged by 20 years of war.
</P>
<P>
	   Thirteen men, including two sets of brothers, appeared in court Monday in
Britain and were charged with seizing an aircraft and its passengers.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban want the hijackers prosecuted and punished, but officials have
not demanded their return to Afghanistan. Taliban Aviation Minister Akhtar
Mohammed Manzoor said they would be sentenced to seven years in jail if
convicted of hijacking at home.
</P>
<P>
	   The Taliban want Britain to return the hijacked jet, one of only four
passenger planes in the state-run airline's fleet. Manzoor said the Taliban have
sent $40,000 to Britain to finance repairs to the plane and said British
authorities are asking for $10,000 more for an airport tax.
</P>
<P>
	   It's unclear if Britain will return the plane to Afghanistan, which is under
U.N. sanctions imposed last November. The sanctions, including a ban on all
international flights by the airline, were imposed after the Taliban refused to
hand over suspected terrorist Osama bin Laden to the United States or a third
country for trial.
</P>
<P>
	   A representatives of the Geneva-based International Organization for
Migration, which chartered Monday's flight from Britain, also was on the tarmac
at Kandahar airport. Tine Staermose gave each the equivalent of $40 to assist
them in returning to their home villages.

<HEADLINE> Polls: McCain, Bush in Dead Heat  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain is seen by likely voters in South Carolina's
Republican primary Saturday as less influenced by special interest groups, while
George W. Bush is seen as more likely to carry out a conservative agenda, says a
new poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles Times poll released Monday shows the race in a virtual dead
heat, with Bush backed by 42 percent and McCain backed by 40 percent. The poll
included 55 percent Republicans, 27 percent independents and 18 percent
Democrats in its sample of 1,047.
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Monday night showed Bush with an edge
over McCain, 49 percent to 42 percent, in South Carolina. A majority in the
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll said they prefer a candidate who is not tied to the
party leaders. A third said Bush has been attacking McCain unfairly, while more
than half said he has not.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's appeal among independents and Democrats keeps him in a close race
with Bush, who has an advantage among Republicans. In 1996, a third of voters in
South Carolina's primary were non-Republicans and two-thirds were self-described
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Times poll, Bush had higher marks from potential voters on the issues
of education and being most effective at getting things done, while McCain
scored higher on foreign policy and bringing change to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of likely voters said Bush would be the strongest nominee in
November, while a third said that about McCain. Bush and McCain about evenly
split the vote among men and women.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain turned the GOP presidential race upside down by winning the New
Hampshire primary Feb. 1. He had a 3-to-1 edge among independent voters and
finished close to Bush among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina has an open GOP primary, meaning independents and Democrats
also may vote. Turnout will be key, because Republicans traditionally are more
likely to vote in their party's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Three-fourths of those surveyed said Bush and McCain have the experience to
be president. Almost two-thirds said Bush was conservative, while just under
half called McCain a conservative and about a fourth said he was a moderate.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, another key primary state, McCain has cut Bush's lead from 45
percent to 22 percent in the last month. The poll by the Public Policy Institute
of California had Bush at 46 percent and McCain at 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times Poll, conducted Thursday through Saturday with 1,047 people
intending to vote in the primary, has an error margin of plus or minus 3
percentage points. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 552 likely voters in the GOP
primary was taken Friday through Sunday and has an error margin of plus or minus
5 percentage points. The PPIC poll of 1,014 likely voters in the GOP primary was
taken Feb. 2-10 and has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Nichols Seeks Dismissal of Charges  </HEADLINE>
   By TIM TALLEY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) -- Bombing conspirator Terry Nichols asked a judge Monday
to dismiss state murder charges against him, claiming they violate the double
jeopardy guarantee against being tried twice for the same crime.
</P>
<P>
	   Attorneys for Nichols, who faces 160 counts of first-degree murder, argued
in a court motion that it is unconstitutional to try him in Oklahoma because he
has already been convicted in federal court for his role in the 1995 Oklahoma
City bombing.
</P>
<P>
	   At a federal trial in Denver, Nichols was found guilty of eight counts of
involuntary manslaughter and one count of conspiracy to use a weapon of mass
destruction. He was sentenced to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols, 44, was also found innocent of eight murder counts.
</P>
<P>
	   A co-conspirator, Timothy McVeigh, was convicted of murder and sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma County District Attorney Bob Macy is seeking the death penalty
against Nichols, and Nichols argues that the double jeopardy clause bars the
state from seeking the death penalty.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Permitting the authorities to take a first shot in federal court and then
to reload and try the defendant a second time in state court, for the same
criminal conduct and basically the same evidence, strips the double jeopardy
clause of its protective force,'' Nichols' motion says.
</P>
<P>
	   Although Macy has not formally responded, he has said he can prosecute
Nichols without violating his constitutional protection against double jeopardy
because the federal and state judicial systems are separate.
</P>
<P>
	   Macy has also pointed out that while Nichols was charged in federal court
with the murders of only eight federal agents, the state charges cover the 160
other victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Nichols also asked the judge to dismiss the case on the grounds that it
would be impossible for him to receive a fair trial in Oklahoma.

<HEADLINE> DEA on Alert After Alleged Threat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL PASO, Texas (AP) -- U.S. drug agents have been asked to take extra
precautions after being warned that a Mexican drug cartel had offered a $200,000
reward for killing a federal officer, an agency spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Michael McManus, a spokesman for the Drug Enforcement Administration, said
agents have been put on ``heightened alert'' in the past two months, and agents
along the Southwest border have been advised to travel in pairs.
</P>
<P>
	   McManus said another federal law enforcement agency alerted the DEA about
the bounty offer. He wouldn't provide further details.
</P>
<P>
	   The threat coincided with a joint Mexico-FBI investigation into mass graves
in Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, just across the border from El Paso. Mexican
authorities have said there are indications that at least seven of the nine
victims unearthed may have been killed by a Juarez-based cartel headed by the
Carrillo Fuentes family.
</P>
<P>
	   According to an internal memo circulated by the Border Patrol, the $200,000
offer was made by that cartel, Border Patrol spokesman Jorge Swank said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``On average, once or twice a year we hear a rumor of that nature,'' said
Roy Villareal, a spokesman for the Border Patrol's San Diego sector. ``It's
become a fact of life for us.''

<TEXT>
<P>
    CINCINNATI (AP) -- The E.W. Scripps Co. will trade The Destin (Fla.) Log and
its sister newspaper, The Walton Log, plus an undisclosed amount of money, for a
Fort Pierce, Fla., daily newspaper, Scripps announced Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Under the trade, Scripps will acquire The Tribune, a Fort Pierce newspaper
owned by Freedom Communications Inc. since 1969.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tribune has circulation of 26,000 daily and 28,000 on Sundays. Scripps
also owns two other dailies on Florida's Atlantic coast, The Stuart News and the
Vero Beach Press Journal.
</P>
<P>
	   The exchange is pending while Scripps and Freedom Communications negotiate a
final agreement. Scripps hopes to complete the deal within two months, company
spokesman Tim Stautberg said.
</P>
<P>
	   Scripps has owned The Destin Log, published twice weekly, since 1984.
Beginning in 1992, Scripps began publishing The Walton Log, a weekly that also
serves northwest Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   Freedom Communications publishes two other Florida daily newspapers, the
Northwest Florida Daily News in Fort Walton Beach and The News Herald in Panama
City, Fla. The company also owns The Walton Sun, a weekly based in Santa Rosa
Beach, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Headquartered in Irvine, Calif., Freedom Communications publishes 27 daily
newspapers and 35 weeklies.
</P>
<P>
	   The Fort Pierce newspaper will give Scripps a total of 20 dailies across the
nation. Scripps also operates nine network-affiliated television stations; three
cable TV networks, Home &AMP; Garden Television, the Food Network and Do It
Yourself; and a TV programmer, Scripps Productions. The company also operates
Scripps Howard News Service; United Media, which syndicates and licenses news
features and comics, and publishes independent Yellow Pages directories.

<HEADLINE> Murderer's Husband Not Poisoned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   STILLWATER, Minn. (AP) -- The husband of one of the state's most notorious
murderers died of heart disease and was not poisoned, authorities said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   Harold Jurgens, 78, died Jan. 13, a day after an unidentified tipster told
authorities Jurgens may have been poisoned by his wife. Lois Jurgens was
convicted in 1987 of beating their adopted son to death more than 20 years
earlier,
</P>
<P>
	   An investigation was started based on the caller's tip and because medical
records taken earlier showed elevated levels of arsenic in Jurgens' blood.
</P>
<P>
	   But an autopsy showed that Jurgens died of cardiomyopathy and found no
presence of the chemcial, Sheriff Jim Frank said.
</P>
<P>
	   The initial lab results were not necessarily wrong because the blood samples
were taken as long as two months before Jurgens died, Frank said.
</P>
<P>
	   Lois Jurgens was convicted of third-degree murder in the 1965 death of the
couple's 3-year-old adopted son, Dennis. She served eight years in prison and
was released in mid-1995.
</P>
<P>
	   The investigation into the boy's death was reopened in the 1980s after
Dennis' birth mother began searching for him and became suspicious when she
learned that he was dead. The case became the subject of a book and a
made-for-television movie.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Rebels Visit Vatican  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   VATICAN CITY (AP) -- Colombian rebels and government officials visited the
Vatican on Monday to seek the Roman Catholic Church's help in ending their
country's 36-year conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Pope John Paul II did not attend the meeting with guerrillas of the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and the Colombian government's
peace commissioner. In his place, the pope sent a Vatican official, reported in
Colombia to be Italian priest Giorgio Lingua.
</P>
<P>
	   Even without the Pope present, participants portrayed the event as a major
step forward in efforts to end fighting that has claimed at least 35,000 lives
in the South American country.
</P>
<P>
	   The meeting was part of a European tour aimed partly at gaining support for
the peace process. But government delegates say they are also trying to expose
the insular FARC to the modern world.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief FARC negotiator Raul Reyes -- who has shed his camouflage fatigues for
a business suit during a European tour that began Feb. 2 -- said the Catholic
Church could play a vital role in ending the fighting.
</P>
<P>
	   In Colombia, Cardinal Dario Castrillon said he thought a future meeting
between the pope and the FARC was possible because ``he meets with sinners and
non-sinners alike.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Pope has frequently mentioned Colombia in his homilies, exhorting an end
to Latin America's longest-running civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
	   Bogota Archbishop Pedro Rubiano said that while talk with the FARC is
important, it is also important to make demands of the rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You have to make these people see that it's not by destroying towns,
killing children and women that peace is made,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Many in Colombia have been critical of President Andres Pastrana's decision
to pursue peace talks with the 15,000-strong insurgency without first obtaining
a cease-fire.

<TEXT>
<P>
   VAN, Turkey (AP) -- Eight people were killed Monday in the bloodiest clashes
between Islamic militants and Turkish police since authorities launched their
massive crackdown against the separatists last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The two separate shootouts in the southeastern city of Van left five
policemen and three militants dead. Three policemen and one gunmen were also
wounded in the raids against the militant Hezbollah group.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah, a Kurdish group, aims to form an Islamic state in the
overwhelmingly Kurdish southeast. Police have carried out many raids against the
group in recent weeks, but this was the first gun battle between the two sides
since the killing of the leader of the group's most militant wing in January.
</P>
<P>
	   Police have detained more than 1,000 suspected militants and unearthed more
than 50 bodies of presumed victims of the group during the crackdown. Last week,
police seized more than 100 assault rifles and more than two dozen grenade
launchers in the basement of the home of a suspected Hezbollah militant.
</P>
<P>
	   Hezbollah is not known to be linked with the Lebanese group of the same
name.
</P>
<P>
	   Turkish newspapers have suggested that the government initially turned a
blind eye or possibly encouraged the group, which in part targeted Marxist
rebels fighting against the Turkish government. The government has denied the
allegations.

<HEADLINE> Strike Delays Boeing Production  </HEADLINE>
    By LUIS CABRERA Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SEATTLE (AP) -- The Air Force said Monday that a nearly week-old strike by
Boeing Co. engineering and technical workers has delayed some testing and
production of the F-22 fighter.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine of the radar-evading jets are built or nearing completion, and the
strike has delayed a scheduled test for structural strength. Two others at
earlier stages of assembly may also be affected, Air Force Secretary F. Whitten
Peters said.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the strike were going on for months ... obviously we might have
difficulty," Peters said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace, which
represents 22,600 engineers and technical workers at Seattle-based Boeing, went
on strike Feb. 9 after federally mediated negotiations over a new contract broke
down. There are no contract offers currently on the table, and no further talks
have been scheduled.
</P>
<P>
	   Boeing, a subcontractor, is doing about one-third of the work on the jet. In
addition to developing and testing much of the electronics, Boeing is building
the F-22's tail section and wings at its south Seattle plant.
</P>
<P>
	   The strike has also delayed delivery of aircraft to buyers. The first delay
came over the weekend, as Boeing confirmed that a 747 jetliner would not be
delivered on time to cargo airline Atlas Air Inc. in Boulder, Colo.

<HEADLINE> McCain Accuses Bush of 'Savagery'  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWOOD, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain defended inconsistencies in his voting
record on public campaign financing as honorable compromises Monday and accused
George W. Bush of ``savagery'' in his criticism. Both men courted the political
middle that could be crucial in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A new Los Angeles Times poll showed the race a statistical dead heat among
likely voters. Bush leads McCain by more than 2-to-1 among conservative
Republicans while McCain leads the Texas governor by the same margin among
moderate independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns tried to strengthen weak spots Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush focused on education as an issue that could appeal to moderates,
particularly women. Advisers were fretting over internal polling indicating that
Bush's sharp attacks on McCain may be hurting him with women voters.
</P>
<P>
	   -- McCain began re-broadcasting two TV commercials that tout his
conservative credentials, including one that notes his anti-abortion voting
record and efforts to take pornography off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush sent 135,000 pieces of mail to independents and Democrats eligible to
vote in the Republican primary, while McCain said luring those voters was a key
to his electoral strategy and to his effort to reshape the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has criticized McCain for inconsistency on public financing of
congressional campaigns, which McCain says he opposes but has voted for as part
of reform packages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've got 200 staffers out combing John McCain's voting record trying to
find some kind of contradictions there,'' said McCain. ``I'm sure they will find
some contradictions there.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,'' McCain said.
``I will make compromises; that's the essence of legislating. ... I'm saying
that I would rather have something that had some public financing in it than the
present system.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has been trying to brand Bush as a negative campaigner, said of
his opponent's criticism: ``This kind of savagery is not necessary in an
American political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, asked about McCain's complaint during a news conference in Saluda,
said, ``How can you call it savagery if the man made five votes, legitimate
votes on the floor of the Senate? It's not savagery; it's what we call full
exposure, full disclosure. ... I'm going to continue talking about differences
of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor even made light of the term when asked if he was going to
be tough on McCain in their debate Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll be short of savagery, if that's what you mean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the day, Bush campaign aides said that during the debate the
governor would raise questions about McCain's consistency on Social Security
issues, including raising the age at which seniors can retire and begin
collecting benefits and spending the fund's surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had his own complaints about McCain's campaigning, especially his
appeals to independents and even Democrats to vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are welcome to come into the party, that's fine with me,'' Bush
said. ``I just don't want Democrats coming in to vote against me because they
think my opponent will be easier to beat in November. We're trying to get rid of
the Clinton era, not reinforce it.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also was taken to task by the National Rifle Association for shifting
his position on another subject: trigger locks for handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged he had changed and now favored such locks, saying, ``When
kids go to school and start killing other kids, obviously sometimes you rethink
your position.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in South Carolina, McCain was increasing his symbolic and
rhetorical use of his war record, opening his day on a stage next to a giant
photo of him in his pilot's uniform. There is a heavy military presence in the
state, and McCain's record as a prisoner of war for five years plays well.
</P>
<P>
	   He also portrayed his reaching outside the Republican Party in primary
season as a positive step.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll reach across the partisan aisle and extend a hand to Democrats,'' he
said. ``The American people are weary of us constantly, constantly fighting with
one another and getting gridlock and never getting anything done.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain even left open the possibility that he would accept the Reform
Party's presidential nomination -- assuming he won the Republican Party's first.

<HEADLINE> Abortion Rights Group To Back Gore  </HEADLINE>
   By LAURA MECKLER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A powerful abortion rights group is endorsing Democratic
presidential candidate Al Gore, who has faced intense scrutiny for his mixed
record on abortion early in his political career.
</P>
<P>
	   The endorsement by the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action
League gives Gore a boost on one of his most vulnerable issues in his battle
with rival Bill Bradley, a former senator.
</P>
<P>
	   NARAL president Kate Michelman planned to appear with Gore Tuesday afternoon
at a Washington hotel to deliver the endorsement.
</P>
<P>
	   The two candidates have been battling to attract core Democratic voters,
including blacks and women, where Gore holds a strong lead over Bradley,
according to national polls.
</P>
<P>
	   To that end, the vice president has been aggressively soliciting
endorsements with groups such as NARAL that had hoped to remain neutral in the
Democratic contest. Gore wrung a similar endorsement for his candidacy last week
from the Human Rights Campaign, a large gay rights group.
</P>
<P>
	   But NARAL decided on its own to make the endorsement, said spokeswoman Julie
Piscitelli.
</P>
<P>
	   ``After two days of thoughtful discussion and deliberation by our board,
they voted unanimously to endorse Gore,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
	   In the past, Michelman has said that both Gore and Bradley are reliable
supporters of abortion rights. She has also said she is confident in Gore's
support for abortion rights now, even though he cast a series of anti-abortion
votes when he was in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Abortion has often been an issue in the Republican presidential primaries,
with candidates trying to prove they are sufficiently against abortion. But
rarely has the issue divided Democrats running for office.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has said that he's always been pro-choice and always believed abortion
should be legal, saying he only had reservations about government funding for
abortions for poor women in Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
	   But as the details of his record emerged, he was forced to admit that his
position has changed.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1987, he said in a letter to a constituent that abortion was ``arguably
the taking of a human life.'' And in 1984, he voted to define the word
``person'' under four existing civil rights laws to include ``unborn children
from the moment of conception.''
</P>
<P>
	   The National Right to Life Committee gave Gore an 84 percent approval rating
for anti-abortion votes he cast while in the House. By contrast, NARAL rated
Gore's House career decidedly ``anti-choice.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has tried to capitalize on the issue. He ran a TV ad in New
Hampshire calling himself the only presidential candidate who ``has been
pro-choice for everyone all the time.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore has responded with a slew of endorsements from feminist leaders and
women in Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   The vice president's front-runner position has been solidified since his
victories in Iowa and New Hampshire, but his camp is working hard to not just
beat Bradley but claim victory by as large a margin as possible.

<HEADLINE> McCain Accuses Bush of 'Savagery'  </HEADLINE>
   By MIKE GLOVER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   GREENWOOD, S.C. (AP) -- John McCain defended inconsistencies in his voting
record on public campaign financing as honorable compromises Monday and accused
George W. Bush of ``savagery'' in his criticism. Both men courted the political
middle that could be crucial in Saturday's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   A new Los Angeles Times poll showed the race a statistical dead heat among
likely voters. Bush leads McCain by more than 2-to-1 among conservative
Republicans while McCain leads the Texas governor by the same margin among
moderate independents and Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns tried to strengthen weak spots Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Bush focused on education as an issue that could appeal to moderates,
particularly women. Advisers were fretting over internal polling indicating that
Bush's sharp attacks on McCain may be hurting him with women voters.
</P>
<P>
	   -- McCain began re-broadcasting two TV commercials that tout his
conservative credentials, including one that notes his anti-abortion voting
record and efforts to take pornography off the Internet.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush sent 135,000 pieces of mail to independents and Democrats eligible to
vote in the Republican primary, while McCain said luring those voters was a key
to his electoral strategy and to his effort to reshape the Republican Party.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush has criticized McCain for inconsistency on public financing of
congressional campaigns, which McCain says he opposes but has voted for as part
of reform packages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You've got 200 staffers out combing John McCain's voting record trying to
find some kind of contradictions there,'' said McCain. ``I'm sure they will find
some contradictions there.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'm not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good,'' McCain said.
``I will make compromises; that's the essence of legislating. ... I'm saying
that I would rather have something that had some public financing in it than the
present system.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, who has been trying to brand Bush as a negative campaigner, said of
his opponent's criticism: ``This kind of savagery is not necessary in an
American political campaign.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush, asked about McCain's complaint during a news conference in Saluda,
said, ``How can you call it savagery if the man made five votes, legitimate
votes on the floor of the Senate? It's not savagery; it's what we call full
exposure, full disclosure. ... I'm going to continue talking about differences
of opinion.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Texas governor even made light of the term when asked if he was going to
be tough on McCain in their debate Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll be short of savagery, if that's what you mean,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Later in the day, Bush campaign aides said that during the debate the
governor would raise questions about McCain's consistency on Social Security
issues, including raising the age at which seniors can retire and begin
collecting benefits and spending the fund's surplus.
</P>
<P>
	   Bush had his own complaints about McCain's campaigning, especially his
appeals to independents and even Democrats to vote in the open primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``People are welcome to come into the party, that's fine with me,'' Bush
said. ``I just don't want Democrats coming in to vote against me because they
think my opponent will be easier to beat in November. We're trying to get rid of
the Clinton era, not reinforce it.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain also was taken to task by the National Rifle Association for shifting
his position on another subject: trigger locks for handguns.
</P>
<P>
	   He acknowledged he had changed and now favored such locks, saying, ``When
kids go to school and start killing other kids, obviously sometimes you rethink
your position.''
</P>
<P>
	   Campaigning in South Carolina, McCain was increasing his symbolic and
rhetorical use of his war record, opening his day on a stage next to a giant
photo of him in his pilot's uniform. There is a heavy military presence in the
state, and McCain's record as a prisoner of war for five years plays well.
</P>
<P>
	   He also portrayed his reaching outside the Republican Party in primary
season as a positive step.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I'll reach across the partisan aisle and extend a hand to Democrats,'' he
said. ``The American people are weary of us constantly, constantly fighting with
one another and getting gridlock and never getting anything done.''
</P>
<P>
	   McCain even left open the possibility that he would accept the Reform
Party's presidential nomination -- assuming he won the Republican Party's first.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked if he would accept the Reform nomination, he replied: ``Sure I would,
as long as they know I'm the nominee of the Republican Party.''
</P>
<P>
	   Most Reform Party talk concerns the possible nominations of Pat Buchanan or
Ross Perot, but at least a few members were suggesting on Monday that McCain
would make a good fit.
</P>
<P>
	   While McCain said the South Carolina primary would be important, he said it
would not settle the fray. ``No matter what happens we're both going on to
Michigan, Arizona and March 7,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   More than a dozen states have their primaries on March 7, and both parties
may well have their presidential nominees decided on that date if not before.

<HEADLINE> Israel Awaits Pope's Visit  </HEADLINE>
   By JACK KATZENELL Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel is building a tent city for 6,000 people and
smoothing the cobblestones of Jerusalem's walled Old City streets in preparation
for the pope's visit here next month, an Israeli official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul II, however, will have to temporarily forsake his popemobile
because it is too wide for the winding alleys of Jerusalem's walled Old City,
said Yossi Noi, director of the agency helping coordinate the visit.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, the pope will visit the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, built over
Jesus' tomb, in an Israeli armored vehicle.
</P>
<P>
	   The pope's visit to the Holy Land, the first by a pontiff since 1964, is
expected to bring thousands of pilgrims to Israel and the Palestinian areas, and
Israel wants to be ready.
</P>
<P>
	   To make sure the 79-year old pontiff's ride is not bumpy, the Old City's
sloping, stepped streets will be fitted with temporary inserts that will create
a smooth, level path to the church, Noi said. The fittings will be removed after
the visit, Noi added.
</P>
<P>
	   When the pontiff arrives at Korazim on the northeastern shore of the Sea of
Galilee, he will find a 6,000-bed tent camp provided free of charge to some of
the 45,000 seminary students who will accompany him on his pilgrimage.
</P>
<P>
	   Not everyone is happy about the visit, however.
</P>
<P>
	   Huge posters protesting the Pope's visit have appeared in Jerusalem's
ultra-Orthodox Jewish neighborhood of Mea Shearim, Israel TV reported Monday.
The television showed posters relating to the visit that proclaimed, ``For
sorrow comes when the enemy is at the gates of Jerusalem.''
</P>
<P>
	   John Paul's visit, following a 1994 treaty establishing diplomatic relations
between Israel and the Vatican, is expected to improve historically troubled
relations between the Catholic Church and the Jewish people.

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill 22 in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early Monday,
ripping people from their beds and piling up mobile homes. At least 22 people
were killed and more than 100 were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of houses and mobile homes in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla
were flattened, their metal and siding mangled and strewn across yards and
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All you heard was a roar, woo-woo-woo,'' said Johnny Jones, whose mobile
home south of Camilla was thrown on its side. He said he freed his 14-year-old
son, who was pinned under a washing machine, and they crawled out a window.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I could see was that everything was demolished. People were hollering
and crying `Where's my child?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tornadoes struck shortly after midnight as a line of thunderstorms
rumbled through the Southeast, scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia.
Authorities in Camilla and surrounding Mitchell County said two separate
twisters cut a 1.5-mile-wide, 10-mile-long path through the county.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hit the impoverished and the affluent,'' said Liz McQueen, a Red Cross
volunteer who was working at a temporary morgue near Camilla.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen people died in Mitchell County, a primarily rural area dotted with
cotton and peanut farms, chicken processing plants, textile factories and a
state prison. Seven people died in neighboring Grady County and one in Colquitt
County. Gov. Roy Barnes, who flew over to assess the damage, declared those
three counties and nearby Tift County disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the victims was Marianne McClelland, 64, who planned to retire from
the Grady County Health Department next month but died along with her husband,
Jackie. Their white farm house was completely gone Monday, except for twisted
pieces of wood scattered through nearby pecan fields by winds over 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Marie Suzette Williams, whose 25th birthday was Monday, was one of three
people killed in one mobile home near Camilla.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Harrell's family was getting ready to move to Florida because he got a
promotion. He survived the tornadoes, but his wife, Shannon, 28, and his
8-month-old daughter, Kylie Rae, were killed. He had been already planning to
adopt his wife's 10-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, Brittany, who
escaped with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
	   The twisters were the deadliest in Georgia since 1936, when 203 people were
killed by tornadoes in Gainesville, northeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds snatched up the trailer where Janet and James Madeiras and their
son Travis, 12, had been sleeping, tossing them out and knocking the trailer on
top of them.
</P>
<P>
	   James Madeiras, 60, said they had just seconds to react. ``The moment I
heard it, the bed dropped down and the walls came tumbling down on top of us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was saying, `Oh my God!' and started digging,'' Janet Madeiras said.
``When I got outside and looked around, everything was gone. You could hear
moaning and crying.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family escaped without major injuries and moved into a shelter with
several neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Families of the injured and missing jammed phone lines and scrambled into
hospitals to find their loved ones. There were so many injuries, people were
sent to hospitals as far away as Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell County Hospital, with only 33 beds, was swamped with more than 120
injured people early Monday. The storms had knocked out power, and the small
staff of doctors and nurses worked under backup power from a generator, trying
to treat the wounded and find other hospitals to handle the overflow.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary assessment found 198 structures destroyed and more than 160
damaged, said Ed Tynes, supervisor of a Red Cross shelter in the gymnasium of
the Mitchell County Middle School. More than 5,000 people were without power.

<HEADLINE> Gore in New York; Bradley in Calif.  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Talking tougher, Bill Bradley accused Al Gore on
Monday of employing ``scare tactics'' to discredit his health care plan and said
the vice president's leadership on the environment has been little more than
``window dressing.''
</P>
<P>
	   Gore, a continent away, focused on education and black voters. He promoted
his ideas for college tuition help in Rochester, N.Y., then headed to Brooklyn
to address students at Medgar Evers College, named for the slain civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, Bradley called Gore's latest charges against his health
care proposals ``the worst use of scare tactics I've seen in years.''
</P>
<P>
	   ``It made my blood boil,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was in northern California to announce a plan to preserve ecosystems
and to try and undercut Gore's image as an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
	   But his sharpest words were on Gore and health care, in a news conference
after the speech. He responded to Gore's assertion over the weekend, in an
interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, that Bradley's health plan would
leave thousands of people with diseases such as AIDS without coverage -- an
incendiary charge in the Bay Area, which has a large gay community.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore ``should be ashamed,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has proposed replacing Medicaid with subsidies so that the poor and
disabled could buy their own insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   He argued his proposal would serve AIDS patients and the poor better than
Gore's because it would allow them to sign up for the same coverage given to
federal employees -- a plan that prohibits discrimination on the basis of
pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Some AIDS patients currently cannot sign up for private coverage because of
their disease, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Local officials, gay activists and an AIDS patient, Jeff Sheehy, joined
Bradley at the microphone to back his argument.
</P>
<P>
	   ``For the vice president to try to frighten people who are in a precarious,
marginal situation causes me to have serious questions about his character,''
said Sheehy.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president's criticism was
on target.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The private market is not going to rush in to provide health care to these
people, certainly not for $150 a month,'' Lehane said, referring to an average
premium Bradley's plan would provide.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's comments came after a weekend convention addressed by both men, at
which Gore issued a withering critique of Bradley's credentials as a Democrat.
Bradley's speech Saturday was more subdued, and he scarcely mentioned Gore as he
offered his leadership vision.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley said Monday that Gore's speech was ``consistent with name
calling -- once again, he called me names -- and I think that demeans our
politics. You can only take it so long.''
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary in California and more than a dozen other states three
weeks away, Bradley turned to an issue dear to many voters here: the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech at the Sierra Club's national headquarters, he said the
Clinton-Gore administration has spent too little money from offshore oil
drilling royalties on protecting public lands, has prosecuted too few polluters,
has done virtually nothing to rally the public behind the ``Kyoto Protocol''
climate change agreement and has failed to follow through on the Central Valley
Project Improvement Act, which sought to better balance water use in the heart
of California.
</P>
<P>
	   ``That is not leadership, it's window dressing,'' Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised if elected to halt all oil drilling off the coast of
California. Gore has pledged to do the same, but Bradley questioned why Gore
couldn't dissuade Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt from extending some
three-dozen offshore leases to petroleum companies last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Nichols, California's resources director, told reporters in a telephone
conference call that Babbitt had no choice in the matter after Interior's top
lawyer advised him that the federal government must extend the leases. She said
there was nothing Gore could do about it.
</P>
<P>
	   ``He doesn't have a record that comes close to matching Al Gore's,'' said
Nichols, who was an assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency from 1993-1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he would create wilderness refuges in the ocean, similar to
those in national forests.
</P>
<P>
	   He received the endorsements Monday of Stewart Udall, who served as interior
secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and of Brent Blackwelder,
president and founder of Friends of the Earth.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Comments on Peace Impasse  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) -- Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Monday said
the current impasse in the Middle East peace process has created a dangerous and
explosive situation.
</P>
<P>
	   The comments came a day after an important target date was missed -- the
deadline for a framework treaty between Israel and the Palestinians for a final
peace settlement. Sunday was the first of three ambitious peace deadlines set by
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The peace process is at an impasse,'' Arafat said in Marrakech, Morocco,
where he was attending a meeting. ``We are going round in circles a long way
from peace.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat said it was a ``dangerous and explosive situation brought about by
the blockage in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.''
</P>
<P>
	   Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, meanwhile, held Barak personally
responsible for the impasse, saying he is ``creating an atmosphere of mistrust''
with Arabs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Failing to keep promises, as the current Israeli prime minister is doing,
is a useless and baffling maneuver,'' Mubarak was quoted as saying by Egypt's
Middle East News Agency. ``The Palestinian issue is the core of the Middle East
dispute and pressures on the Palestinians to give up their rights will lead to
an explosion.''
</P>
<P>
	   Israel accuses the Palestinians of asking for too much, too soon. Late on
Sunday, Arafat and his Fatah Revolutionary Council said the Palestinians are
entitled to statehood this year, no later than September.
</P>
<P>
	   September is the deadline for a peace treaty with Israel that would define
the terms of Palestinian statehood. However, talks have bogged down, raising
questions about whether an agreement is possible by the deadline.
</P>
<P>
	   In Washington, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin dismissed the
passing of the target date as simply a consequence of the complexity of issues
confronting the two sides.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't get discouraged,'' Rubin said. ``We want to move forward.''
</P>
<P>
	   Arafat arrived in Morocco on Sunday night for a meeting of the 16-nation Al
Qods Committee of the Organization of the Islamic Conference.

<HEADLINE> Elian Lawyers Push Asylum Hearing  </HEADLINE>
   By RACHEL LA CORTE Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   MIAMI (AP) -- Lawyers for the U.S. relatives of Elian Gonzalez argued Monday
that the Immigration and Naturalization Service cannot send the 6-year-old boy
back to Cuba without first holding an asylum hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   The attorneys asked a federal judge to deny the government's request that
their lawsuit be dismissed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Federal law is clear that any alien who is physically present in the
United States ... has the right to apply for asylum,'' the attorneys said in a
motion.
</P>
<P>
	   Government lawyers have argued that the Miami relatives have no legal
standing in the boy's case. The INS ruled last month that only Juan Miguel
Gonzalez, the boy's father, has the right to speak for him in immigration
matters.
</P>
<P>
	   Elian's father has repeatedly said he wants his son returned to Cuba.
</P>
<P>
	   The custody battle began after Elian was rescued off the coast of Florida on
Nov. 25 after a boat sank and took the life of his mother and 10 others headed
from Cuba to Florida.
</P>
<P>
	   After the INS ruled that Elian should be sent back to Cuba, his great-uncle
Lazaro Gonzalez, who has temporary custody of the boy in Miami, sued to block
the return. A judge is expected to hear arguments Feb. 22 and decide whether the
lawsuit should go forward.
</P>
<P>
	   Armando Gutierrez, the spokesman for Elian's U.S. relatives, said the family
is anxiously awaiting the hearing.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They pray every day and hope that God will help,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Car Booster Seats Urged for Kids  </HEADLINE>
   By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Children who have outgrown child safety seats in cars
need to use booster seats -- not adult seat belts -- to ensure maximum
protection in crashes, federal officials said Monday in announcing a new safety
campaign.
</P>
<P>
	   Children outgrow child seats but cannot properly fit into adult belts when
they weigh 40 to 80 pounds and are about 4 to 8 years old. But less than 5
percent of those children use booster seats, according to an ongoing study of
more than 20,000 children by the University of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital

	   ``Booster seats, properly used, can help prevent injury to older children by
making adult-sized seat belts fit effectively,'' Transportation Secretary Rodney
Slater said in announcing a campaign that includes distribution of 50,000
brochures and $7.5 million in grant money to states to promote child passenger
safety.
</P>
<P>
	   Studies show about 70 percent of children ages 3 and under are properly
restrained but that number drops to as low as 20 percent for children between
ages 4 and 9, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said.
</P>
<P>
	   Booster seats allow children who have outgrown child seats to properly
position lap belts around their hips and shoulder belts across their chests.
</P>
<P>
	   Without the seats, the shoulder belts can tangle around a child's neck and
the lap portion of the belt rides up over the abdomen. That lap belt position
places children at risk of liver, spleen, intestinal and spinal cord injuries
during a crash.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1998, 495 children between ages 5 and 9 were killed and 86,000 were
injured in crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   Meantime, Ford Motor Co. announced Monday it would provide free dealer
installation of tether strap anchors in all its vehicles from 1989 through 2000
models. The strap, already required in Canada, more securely fastens the top of
child seats to better protect children from too much forward head movement in
crashes.
</P>
<P>
	   The federal government is requiring top tether anchors in all vehicles
beginning with the 2001 model year. The strap usually is connected to the back
of a vehicle's package shelf.

<HEADLINE> Officer Cries on Stand Over Diallo  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- One of the police officers who killed unarmed West
African immigrant Amadou Diallo in a barrage of 41 bullets broke into tears
Monday as he testified that he opened fire to defend his partner after seeing
Diallo reach for what looked like a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was just a wallet,'' the officer, Sean Carroll said. ``I said, `Where's
the (expletive) gun?'''
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said Diallo was still breathing, and ``I held his hand and rubbed
his face'' and pleaded: ``Please, don't die.''
</P>
<P>
	   The officer also testified that he thought Diallo was wearing a bulletproof
vest because he did not immediately fall down after the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll is on trial on murder charges along with three fellow New York City
police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public account of the shooting, Carroll said that he and his
three partners were looking for a serial rapist reported to be carrying a gun.
Carroll said that instead of stopping when the officers asked to talk to him,
Diallo walked backward and started digging in his right pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I heard Officer (Edward) McMellon repeating, `Police, show us your
hands,''' Carroll said. ``We said it clearly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said that he saw Diallo start to remove a black object from his
right side. ``I just said, `Gun. He's got a gun,''' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Believing that he had just pulled and was about to fire a gun at my
partner, I fired my weapon,'' Carroll testified, taking off his glasses,
dropping his head and sobbing into a tissue.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, Carroll said he didn't know who fired the first shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, said he kept shooting into the vestibule of Diallo's apartment
building in the Bronx last February because McMellon fell down and because
Diallo did not. Both Carroll and McMellon, 27, fired all 16 rounds from their
semiautomatic pistols.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At that point, I thought the individual was wearing a bulletproof vest,
that he had just shot my partner and that he didn't want to go to jail,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But after Diallo finally fell, struck by 19 bullets, ``I looked down at it
and I seen it was a wallet.''
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon's testimony corroborated Carroll's account of what happened. He,
too, said he was unsure who fired the first shot. Both officers said they fired
all 16 shots from their rapid-fire pistols because Diallo did not immediately go
down.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, also are expected to take the
stand. If convicted, they could get 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved to Albany because of pretrial publicity and protests
over the shooting of the unarmed black man by four white officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination, Carroll admitted Diallo did not closely resemble a
description of the rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   And prosecutor Donald Levin pressed Carroll on what was so suspicious about
a man standing on his front stoop. ``Looking up and down the block is not a
crime, is it officer?'' Levin asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, it is not,'' the officer responded.

<HEADLINE> Urgent MD-80 Inspections Wind Down  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suspect parts removed from the tail sections of several
MD-80 series airplanes were in government hands Monday as the urgent inspection
program for the planes wound down.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrews used to move the stabilizers were replaced in a number of
planes after inspections revealed grit or metal shavings in their lubricant,
Federal Aviation Administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines were ordered Friday to inspect the planes within 72 hours, after
problems were found in the jackscrew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, an MD-83
that crashed Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew lost control of that plane while trying to fix a problem with the
stabilizer, a tail part that controls the plane's up-and-down motion. The long
jackscrew moves the stabilizer, a design that is similar in nearly 1,100 MD-80,
MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes in service with various airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has also been checking its planes and no problems have been
found during inspections of the 29 C-9 aircraft operated by the Navy and Marine
Corps, said Navy spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth Zimmermann. The C-9 is the military
version of the DC-9.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspect jackscrews removed from aircraft were being turned over to the FAA.
Some were already being evaluated at the National Transportation Safety Board
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB, meanwhile, reported that two years ago the jackscrew on the
crashed plane had been slated for replacement during an inspection, but a
recheck determined it operated within allowable limits so it was left in
service. It had since been rechecked several times and passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The significance of this information is continuing to be evaluated by the
NTSB. No determination has been made as to whether this information has any
bearing on the accident,'' the Safety Board said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal grand jury has been investigating a whistle-blower's complaints of
maintenance irregularities at the airline's Oakland service center. However, the
Federal Aviation Administration said earlier this month that the jet that
crashed was not involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to ordering the inspections, the FAA increased the frequency of
regular jackscrew inspections from every eight months to about every three
months.
</P>
<P>
	   The exact number of planes subject to inspection was not clear, with the FAA
initially reporting Monday that 1,027 planes were involved but later raising
that to 1,098.
</P>
<P>
	   Here is a rundown of the inspection findings so far, listing the number of
each airline's planes that need inspections and any problems found. Not all
airlines had finished the inspections at the time this list was compiled.
</P>
<P>
	   Airborne Express, 75 planes, two jackscrews found to lack lubricant, both
were lubed.
</P>
<P>
	   AirTran, 44 planes, two had grit in the jackscrew grease, one failed a
movement check, all three jackscrews were replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, 34 planes, eight problems were found, four jackscrews were
replaced and the others are being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   Allegiant Air, three planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines, 284 planes, one jackscrew lacked lubricant, it was
lubricated.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental Airlines, 69 planes, one had grit in the jackscrew grease, the
jackscrew was replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Air Lines, 136 planes, four with problems found, one jackscrew
replaced, one was relubed, two are being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaiian Airlines, 15 planes, two had shavings in the grease, both
jackscrews replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Kitty Hawk, 5 planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   Legend Airlines, 4 planes, no report.
</P>
<P>
	   Midwest Express, 31 planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Airlines, 172 planes, one with grit in the grease, jackscrew
replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Spirit, 25 planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA, 131 planes, one with metal shavings, jackscrew replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   USAirways, 62 planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   US Jet Express, 8 planes, no problems found.

Records Show Stewart Continued To Hand Out Human Resources Grants
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Human Resources Minister Jane Stewart approved $3 million in
job-creation grants in November and December -- right after she was told that an
internal audit had uncovered sloppy administration and inadequate monitoring of
department spending.
</P>
<P>
	   Government records, obtained by the Reform party under the Access to
Information Act, show Stewart approved six grants worth more than $800,000 on
Nov. 18.
</P>
<P>
	   That was the day after she has admitted being briefed for the first time on
the audit.
</P>
<P>
	   By Dec. 3 she had approved 13 more grants, bringing the total to $3.07
million in new spending under the Canada Jobs Fund, the successor to the earlier
Transitional Jobs Fund which expired in March 1999.
</P>
<P>
	   The jobs fund, in both its versions, has been under fire for the last year
by opposition MPs who portray it as a political slush fund used by the Liberal
government to dole out grants to win electoral favor.
</P>
<P>
	   The audit, however, ranged more widely. It suggested up to $1 billion a year
in job-creation, training, literacy and other programs was being spent without
proper administrative safeguards.

Lawyers Argue For $15-Million Cut of $1.2-Billion Compensation Deal
</P>
<P>
	   TORONTO (AP) -- A team of nine Ontario lawyers went to court Monday seeking
a $15-million fee for their part in winning a $1.2-billion compensation deal for
Canadians who contracted hepatitis C through tainted blood.
</P>
<P>
	   But six months after the federal-provincial package was approved, none of
the roughly 10,000 victims has received a penny -- frustrating those who have
waited years for financial recognition of their suffering.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There's no doubt the lawyers deserve payment for their work,'' said
Michael McCarthy, vice-president of the Canadian Hemophilia Society.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But we believe the victims should receive financial help first.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Ontario lawyers have already received about $3.2 million, but say they
deserve more because they helped sweeten the landmark deal.

Committee on Clarity Bill Will Not Travel Across Canada
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- The government's clarity bill on sovereignty referendums is
neither complicated nor detailed enough to merit holding public hearings on it
across Canada, Liberal MPs said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Liberal majority on a parliamentary committee studying Bill C-20 voted
against traveling from province to province to hear witnesses on the
legislation. It was the inaugural meeting of the committee.
</P>
<P>
	   All four opposition parties supported holding hearings outside Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   The legislation stems from a 1998 Supreme Court opinion that said a
referendum question and majority should be clear, and if so Canada and the
provinces would be morally bound to negotiate with Quebec.
</P>
<P>

Canadian Forces Will Continue To Use Remote-Controlled Mines
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Defense Minister Art Eggleton says explosive devices known as
claymore mines are not mines, do not violate the Ottawa treaty to ban landmines,
and will stay in Canada's arsenal.
</P>
<P>
	   But Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy said Monday use of the devices
by Canadian peacekeepers raises questions about whether Canada is complying with
the spirit of the treaty to ban landmines.
</P>
<P>
	   Axworthy has asked Daniel Livermore, Canada's ambassador on landmines
action, to look into the matter.
</P>
<P>
	   Claymore mines are hidden on the ground and detonated by a soldier using an
electronic trigger. Eggleton said they have been sent to East Timor and deployed
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
	   They are used as a security device to defend the perimeter of bases where
troops are living. They would be hooked up to a sentry post and could be fired
manually if a hostile force tried to penetrate the base.
</P>
<P>
	   They are not banned under the Ottawa treaty which focused on mines that are
buried and indiscriminately kill or maim anyone who steps on them.
</P>

Ottawa Will Get More Growth From Social Spending Than Tax Cuts
</P>
<P>
	   OTTAWA (AP) -- Increased federal spending on health care and education would
give the economy -- and Canadians -- a bigger boost than would tax cuts, says a
new study.
</P>
<P>
	   In fact, argues Andrew Jackson of the Canadian Labor Congress, there is
little evidence to prove tax cuts do much to stimulate the economy.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The magical powers of tax cuts to spur economic growth are greatly
exaggerated,'' Jackson said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
	   His findings, to be released Tuesday, come as the pre-budget debate is
intensifying over how to divvy up growing federal surpluses.
</P>
<P>
	   Pressure has been increasing on Finance Minister Paul Martin to deeply cut
personal and corporate taxes.
</P>
<P>
	   Many have argued lower taxes help stimulate a virtuous cycle by boosting
economic growth, which leads to job creation.

<HEADLINE> First lady picks up Irish award, raises cash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   WASHINGTON (AP) - Hillary Rodham Clinton picked up an award Monday for
her work on the peace process in Ireland and helped raise cash for an Irish
Democratic group.
<P>
	   The $500-a-head fund raiser at the Georgetown home of Elizabeth Frawley
Bagley, former U.S. ambassador to Portugal, benefited the Irish American
Democrats, a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's director, Stella O'Leary, said she expected to spend the maximum
allowable $10,000 on the first lady's Senate bid and would also spend money on
Al Gore's presidential bid.
</P>
<P>
	   "This tonight will benefit Hillary's campaign,"
</P>
<P>
	   Bagley said to about 100 guests Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The event was billed as an official White House function and at least one
White House staffer attended with the first lady. Candidates are barred from
using official staff for campaign-related events like fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton's campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson maintained that the fund
raiser was to benefit the Irish American Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   "We have no control over how they spend their money," Wolfson said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Leary said the Irish American Democrats would hold another fund raiser for
the first lady on St. Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The award Monday night comes after the first lady waded into trouble in the
Irish community by agreeing to march in New York City's St. Patrick's Day
Parade. Many Democrats avoid the parade because it excludes the Irish Lesbian
and Gay Organization. Clinton's likely U.S. Senate race rival, New York City
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, always marches in the parade.
</P>
<P>
	   It also comes as the peace process itself threatens to tear apart. Last
week, the 10-week-old Cabinet of Protestants and Catholics in Belfast was
suspended after the Irish Republican Army refused to disarm. The power-sharing
cabinet was the centerpiece of the 1998 Good Friday Peace Accord. The British
and Irish governments are working to salvage the joint administration.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said Monday night she was optimistic the setback was "a bump in the
road but it's going to be resolved."
</P>
<P>
	   "We have brought this to an extraordinary point and we must finish it
together," Clinton said
</P>
<P>
	   'I was pleased to play a role in trying to bring peace in a tangible way to
people and try to bring it from the headlines to the breadlines and the work
lines," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
	   The first lady has visited Ireland several times and spoken out for the
peace process. The Irish community is a powerful voting block in New York, where
Clinton is running for the U.S. Senate.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Rise  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar edged higher against the yen early Tuesday on
purchases by Japanese banks and U.S. funds. Japanese stocks rose moderately
following an advance on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 108.84 yen, up 0.52 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also
marginally higher than its late New York level of 108.83 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 98.04 points, or 0.50
percent, to 19,654.50 in the first 30 minutes of trading. On Monday, the average
closed down 153.56 points, or 0.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar retained strength against the yen as
Japanese bank dealers and some U.S. funds covered their short, or oversold
positions.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.56 yen, down from 107.04 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started higher on buying of high technology
issues in line with gains in their U.S. counterparts in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 94.63 points, or 0.9
percent, to close at 10,519.84 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, bank stocks were among early losers following media reports Monday
night that the Tokyo Metropolitan government would go ahead with a controversial
tax on major Tokyo-based banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-year plan, proposed by Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara, calls for a 3
percent tax imposed on the gross operating income of banks with deposits and
equivalent funds of $47 billion (5 trillion yen) or more, starting in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Ishihara, who wants to improve Tokyo's revenue shortfall, was to present a
bill to parties in the city assembly Wednesday, with approval expected by late
March, the national Asahi newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 17.15 points, or 1.00 percent, to 1,734.56. The TOPIX closed down
12.06 points, or 0.70 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8000
percent from Monday's finish of 1.8300 percent. Its price rose 0.25 point to
99.14.

<HEADLINE> S.C. Gov. Offers Flag Compromise  </HEADLINE>
   By JIM DAVENPORT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- Gov. Jim Hodges introduced his plan Monday for moving
the Confederate flag from the Statehouse dome, saying it should be placed at a
Confederate monument on the Capitol's grounds.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is clear that an overwhelming majority of South Carolinians want to
bring closure to this issue,'' Hodges told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Even before the announcement, the South Carolina Council of Conservative
Citizens called the first-term Democratic governor a liar, saying he promised
during his campaign that he would stay neutral on the issue.
</P>
<P>
	   Only the Legislature can remove the flag from the dome. State Sen. John
Land, who will sponsor Hodges' proposal, acknowledged he didn't have the votes
to cut off a threatened filibuster by lawmakers who want the flag to stay up.
</P>
<P>
	   Noticeably missing from Hodges' news conference was the National Association
for the Advancement of Colored People, which wants the flag removed from
Statehouse grounds altogether and has started a tourism boycott of the state
until the flag comes down.
</P>
<P>
	   Hodges' proposal ``isn't one that will cause the sanctions to be lifted,''
said Dr. Lonnie Randolph, president of the NAACP's Columbia branch.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan was floated several weeks ago, Randolph said. ``It was unacceptable
then when it was mentioned and it's unacceptable today,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina is the only state that flies the Confederate flag above its
Statehouse. The fate of the flag has become one of the most divisive issues in
the state. Some see the flag, first raised at the Capitol in 1962, as a sign of
racism, while others see it as a symbol of heritage.
</P>
<P>
	   Hodges proposed putting the flag on a pole beside a statue of a horse-riding
Confederate Gen. Wade Hampton, between the Statehouse and a state office
building also named after Hampton.
</P>
<P>
	   Some flag supporters have said they want it displayed at the more prominent
Confederate soldiers' monument at the Statehouse.
</P>
<P>
	   John Hill, a spokesman for the Council of Conservative Citizens, said Hodges
``promised in his campaign that he wouldn't make any effort, he wouldn't
initiate any effort, to bring down the flag. ... Governor Hodges has lied to the
people of South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed compromise comes in advance of Saturday's Republican
presidential primary. The leading candidates, Gov. George W. Bush and Arizona
Sen. John McCain, have both said the flag issue should be decided by South
Carolinians.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We want to send a signal to the nation and to our children that South
Carolinians can come together to do the right thing,'' Hodges said.

<HEADLINE> 17 Hurt in Calif. Highway Pileup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- At least 61 vehicles collided in a
chain-reaction pileup Monday, injuring 17 people on a fog-shrouded section of
Interstate 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the injured were in serious condition, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Visibility in the fog was less than 100 feet and the pavement was wet, so
motorists had no time to react to collisions in front of them, California
Highway Patrol investigators said. The posted speed limit is 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8:30 a.m. crash involved 55 cars and six to eight big-rigs in the
southbound lanes at the 4,000-foot level near Cajon Summit, said patrol officer
Kevin Haney. Most of the damage was of the fender-bender variety.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Bruce Freeman said he encountered visibility down to 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came to a stop and this gal came screaming down the hill doing about 65
or 70 mph and spun out of control, clipped us and wiped out another vehicle and
sent two people to the hospital,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fog lifted by late morning in the area 60 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles. The southbound lanes of the interstate reopened about 12:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Delegation Visits Colombia  </HEADLINE>
   By FRANK BAJAK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- As new figures showed a 20 percent rise in
Colombian cocaine production, a high-level U.S. delegation met Monday with
leaders of this turbulent nation to discuss a drug-fighting aid package.
</P>
<P>
	   The visit was led by Thomas Pickering, the State Department's third-ranking
official. It came as the U.S. Congress was opening debate on the proposed
two-year, $1.6 billion aid package that would dramatically escalate the war on
drugs in Colombia.
</P>
<P>
	   Primarily a military aid plan, the package includes 63 helicopters and the
training and equipping of two new army counter-drug battalions. It aims to give
Colombia the firepower, mobility and intelligence to defeat leftist rebels who
protect drug crops.
</P>
<P>
	   ``If the guerrillas are participating in the drug trade, and I have no doubt
about that, they certainly are objectives of our fight against drug
trafficking,'' Pickering said.
</P>
<P>
	   The Andean country solidified its place last year as the world's principal
source of cocaine, according to new figures compiled by the CIA.
</P>
<P>
	   Cultivation of coca, the drug's raw material, increased 20 percent in
Colombia last year, the figures said. Land used for the drug totaled 465 square
miles, up from 393 square miles in 1998, according to the estimates provided to
The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
	   Coca cultivation has long been widespread in neighboring South American
countries too. But due largely to Colombia's instability -- nearly half the
country is controlled by leftist rebels and their paramilitary foes, both
largely financed by the drug trade -- traffickers have moved the bulk of coca
cultivation here since the mid-1990s.
</P>
<P>
	   As a result, acreage devoted to the shiny green coca bush dropped in
neighboring Peru from 197 to 150 square miles from 1998 to 1999 and in Bolivia
from 147 to 85 square miles, the new figures show.
</P>
<P>
	   Overall, estimated cocaine production in the region was down over the period
from 825 to 765 metric tons, the CIA believes.
</P>
<P>
	   ``As a result of the successful counterdrug operations in Peru and Bolivia,
the traffickers have been shifting their operations and consolidating their
cocaine production in Colombia,'' U.S. drug czar Barry McCaffrey said in a
statement from Washington. ``We have actually seen significant reductions in
coca cultivation in Colombia where eradication programs are carried out.''
</P>
<P>
	   The Clinton Administration's aid package would permit an army push this year
into guerrilla-dominated southern jungles, where Colombian officials say the
coca crop has tripled in the past two years. U.S.-trained troops would provide
ground and air protection while planes spray herbicides on the crops.
</P>
<P>
	   Armed resistance could come from the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia -- the guerrilla group that dominates the countryside of southern
Putumayo state, taxes the coca and protects drug laboratories and clandestine
airstrips.
</P>
<P>
	   Also, Colombia's defense minister is expecting violent peasant protests.
Tens of thousands of peasants in Putumayo -- many of them internal refugees of
the country's nearly 36-year civil conflict -- depend on coca for their
livelihood.
</P>
<P>
	   President Andres Pastrana said last week that his government expects
thousands of those peasants to be displaced once the cocaine crops are killed.
Some will have to be relocated.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposed U.S. aid package includes $176 million for resettling uprooted
peasants and helping them find a legal way to make a living. Apart from the
usual counter-narcotics and military officials, the U.S. delegation in Colombia
this time included Julia Taft, the State Department's top refugee official.
</P>
<P>
	   However, Colombian government resettlement and alternative development plans
-- promoting crops including coffee and cotton -- are still in early planning
stages.

<HEADLINE> Japan Says Economy Improves  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economy has improved modestly for the last five months
but recession-weary consumers remain hesitant to spend, the government said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The assessment came in a monthly report by the Economic Planning Agency. Its
pronouncements are closely watched by businesses and analysts as key indicators
of the government's thinking on the state of the world's second-largest economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The cautiously optimistic verdict delivered in the February report was
identical to the agency's four previous monthly assessments.
</P>
<P>
	   The EPA said the economy got a lift from an emergency public spending
program approved last year by the administration of Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
	   In December, Obuchi's Cabinet adopted a supplementary budget worth $165
billion (18 trillion yen) to help ensure Japan achieves its 0.6 percent growth
target for the fiscal year ending in March.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency also pointed to rising orders for basic machinery as an
encouraging trend. Orders rose 16.1 percent in December, suggesting
private-sector investment may be picking up.
</P>
<P>
	   On the downside, the report said consumers cut back purchases as companies
slashed winter bonuses. Household spending dropped 4 percent in December from
the previous year, as bonuses and other extraordinary income plummeted 5
percent.
</P>
<P>
	   Private consumption accounts for 60 percent of Japan's gross domestic
product. Most economists agree the country won't be able to sustain growth until
individuals feel confident enough to open their wallets.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite the decline in spending late last year, EPA spokesman Takashi Omori
said consumer gloom may be lifting.
</P>
<P>
	   "Based on what I've heard, spending from January onward has been
comparatively good," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
	   Japan has been struggling to emerge from its worst economic downturn in over
50 years. The economy finally started growing again, but then shrank in the
July-September quarter of last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Late last month, EPA chief Taichi Sakaiya said the economy probably also
contracted during the October-December quarter. If so, that would mean a return
to recession.
</P>
<P>
	   But he also said the government still expects to hit its growth target for
the full fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
	   In another monthly report published Tuesday, Japan's central bank painted a
similar picture of an economy making gradual progress toward recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   The Bank of Japan's February report said that "the economic environment
surrounding private demand is gradually improving" but added that "clear signs
of a self-sustained recovery in private demand have not been observed yet."

<HEADLINE> Canada Declines To Sanction Oil Co.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OTTAWA (AP) -- The government has accused a Canadian oil company that
operates in Sudan of ignoring human rights abuses in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
	   The findings were in a report Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd
Axworthy released Monday. However, he ruled out imposing sanctions on Talisman
Energy Inc. or the east African nation of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   Instead, Axworthy called for Leonardo Franco, the U.N.'s chief human rights
investigator assigned to Sudan, to further investigate the situation in the
southern Sudan oil region.
</P>
<P>
	   The report said Talisman had turned a blind eye to forced movement of
civilians in the area around the oil operations.
</P>
<P>
	   Franco reported last year that fierce fighting over an oil-rich area where
Talisman and other companies operate caused villagers considered sympathetic to
the Sudan People's Liberation Army rebels to be displaced.
</P>
<P>
	   The rebels have been fighting for autonomy from Sudan's majority Muslim
north since 1983. An estimated 2 million people have died in the conflict and 4
million have been displaced.
</P>
<P>
	   The report also charged that the airstrip Talisman uses to move people and
supplies has used by the military, possibly to launch attacks against the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
	   While rejecting sanctions, Axworthy said that Canada would help fund social
programs in Sudan and would use its upcoming presidency of the U.N. Security
Council to focus on humanitarian issues of the Sudan conflict. Canada will also
open an office in Khartoum to offer consular services and promote human rights,
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Talisman, one of Canada's biggest oil companies, has invested more than $500
million in oil drilling and pipeline development in the Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We endorse Minister Axworthy's commitment to enhanced involvement by
Canada in fostering an end to the conflict in Sudan,'' Jim Buckee, Talisman's
president and chief executive officer, said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The report was prepared by diplomat John Harker, sent by Axworthy to Sudan
in November to make sure that the revenues of the Calgary-based Talisman were
reserved for humanitarian and development purposes.
</P>
<P>
	   Axworthy's measures fell short of the recommendations by Harker, who called
for oil revenues now given to the Sudanese government to be put into a trust
fund under conditions acceptable to political groups in southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It is difficult to imagine a cease-fire while oil extraction continues,
and almost impossible to do so if revenues keep flowing'' to the Sudanese
government, Harker wrote.
</P>
<P>
	   Mel Middleton of Freedom Quest International, a human rights group, called
Axworthy's response to the Harker report ``a knife in the back to the victims of
Sudan's brutal war.''

<HEADLINE> Urgent MD-80 Inspections Wind Down  </HEADLINE>
   By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suspect parts removed from the tail sections of several
MD-80 series airplanes were in government hands Monday as the urgent inspection
program for the planes wound down.
</P>
<P>
	   The jackscrews used to move the stabilizers were replaced in a number of
planes after inspections revealed grit or metal shavings in their lubricant,
Federal Aviation Administration officials said.
</P>
<P>
	   Airlines were ordered Friday to inspect the planes within 72 hours, after
problems were found in the jackscrew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, an MD-83
that crashed Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
	   The crew lost control of that plane while trying to fix a problem with the
stabilizer, a tail part that controls the plane's up-and-down motion. The long
jackscrew moves the stabilizer, a design that is similar in nearly 1,100 MD-80,
MD-90, DC-9 and Boeing 717 planes in service with various airlines.
</P>
<P>
	   The military has also been checking its C-9 planes, the military version of
the DC-9. No problems have been found during inspections of the 29 C-9 aircraft
operated by the Navy and Marine Corps, said Navy spokeswoman Lt. Elizabeth
Zimmermann.
</P>
<P>
	   Air Force spokesman Capt. Brad Jessmer said all of his service's operational
C-9s had passed inspection, while the planes currently down for maintenance
still have to be checked.
</P>
<P>
	   Suspect jackscrews removed from aircraft were being turned over to the FAA.
Some were already being evaluated at the National Transportation Safety Board
laboratory.
</P>
<P>
	   The NTSB, meanwhile, reported that two years ago the jackscrew on the
crashed plane had been slated for replacement during an inspection, but a
recheck determined it operated within allowable limits so it was left in
service. It had since been rechecked several times and passed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The significance of this information is continuing to be evaluated by the
NTSB. No determination has been made as to whether this information has any
bearing on the accident,'' the Safety Board said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
	   A federal grand jury has been investigating a whistle-blower's complaints of
maintenance irregularities at the airline's Oakland service center. However, the
Federal Aviation Administration said earlier this month that the jet that
crashed was not involved in the investigation.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to ordering the inspections, the FAA increased the frequency of
regular jackscrew inspections from every eight months to about every three
months.
</P>
<P>
	   The exact number of planes subject to inspection was not clear, with the FAA
initially reporting Monday that 1,027 planes were involved but later raising
that to 1,098.
</P>
<P>
	   Here is a rundown of the inspection findings so far, listing the number of
each airline's planes that need inspections and any problems found. Not all
airlines had finished the inspections at the time this list was compiled.
</P>
<P>
	   Airborne Express, 75 planes, two jackscrews found to lack lubricant, both
were lubed.
</P>
<P>
	   AirTran, 44 planes, two had grit in the jackscrew grease, one failed a
movement check, all three jackscrews were replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Alaska Airlines, 34 planes, eight problems were found, four jackscrews were
replaced and the others are being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   Allegiant Air, three planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   American Airlines, 284 planes, one jackscrew lacked lubricant, it was
lubricated.
</P>
<P>
	   Continental Airlines, 69 planes, one had grit in the jackscrew grease, the
jackscrew was replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Delta Air Lines, 136 planes, four with problems found, one jackscrew
replaced, one was relubed, two are being evaluated.
</P>
<P>
	   Hawaiian Airlines, 15 planes, two had shavings in the grease, both
jackscrews replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Kitty Hawk, 5 planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   Legend Airlines, 4 planes, no report.
</P>
<P>
	   Midwest Express, 31 planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   Northwest Airlines, 172 planes, one with grit in the grease, jackscrew
replaced.
</P>
<P>
	   Spirit, 25 planes, no problems found.
</P>
<P>
	   TWA, 131 planes, one with metal shavings, jackscrew replaced.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Balance With Austria  </HEADLINE>
   By TERENCE HUNT AP White House Correspondent
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said Monday the United States has to
strike ``a delicate balance'' in dealing with Austria, voicing disapproval of
Joerg Haider's far-right Freedom Party without doing ``anything that builds his
support even further.
</P>
<P>
	   ``But I think it ought to be clear to every Austrian citizen that we in the
United States do not approve of his political program or his excessive
rhetoric,'' Clinton said an interview carried on CNN and on its Web page.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton also said he was optimistic about reviving peace talks in the Middle
East. However, he acknowledged that ``we're in a little tough patch right now''
with a freeze in talks between Israel and Syria, a missed deadline for an
Israeli-Palestinian peace framework, and fresh violence in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We're down to the hard decisions,'' the president said. He added that
``we're so close on the substance that I am optimistic.''
</P>
<P>
	   The interview ranged from foreign policy to domestic subjects.
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton said that recent hacker attacks against popular Internet sites were
``obviously very disturbing.'' But he said, ``I think there is a way that we can
clearly promote security. I think it's important the American people not
overreact to this.''
</P>
<P>
	   Clinton will hold a White House meeting Tuesday with cyber experts.
</P>
<P>
	   Some 10,400 users ``joined'' the 25-minute online chat with Clinton, said
CNN spokesman Paul Schur. He said one of them slipped past CNN's filtering
system and said -- under Clinton's name -- that he would like to see more
pornography on the Internet. Schur said he did not know how the imposter eluded
the filter but that the computer system was not hacked.
</P>
<P>
	   Asked about Russia, Clinton offered support for Vladimir Putin, the acting
president and head of its government. ``Based on what I have seen so far,''
Clinton said, ``I think that the United States can do business with this man.
... We don't agree with him on everything but what I have seen of him so far
indicates to me that he's capable of being a very strong and effective and
straightforward leader.''
</P>
<P>
	   The United States and European Union have isolated Austria because of the
Freedom Party's rise to power. Clinton said the EU has been ``very tough in
condemning what the Austrians have done here. So I think we're on the right
track.
</P>
<P>
	   ``There is a delicate balance, however,'' the president continued. ``You
know, Austria is a democracy. This man's party got a certain percentage of the
vote. He did it based on appeals that went well beyond a narrow race-based
appeal.
</P>
<P>
	   ``And we don't want to say or do anything that build his support even
further,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   On other subjects, Clinton:
</P>
<P>
	   --Said he was trying to help find ``the right balance'' about taxing goods
sold on the Internet. Some governors say states are losing revenue they deserve,
and that stores have to charge state and local sales taxes, while Internet sites
don't. ``You don't want to burden the Internet but you don't want to put people
who aren't making sales on it out of business,'' the president said.
</P>
<P>
	   --Said, ``I love this job. I don't know if I'll ever do anything again that
I love the work as much as I love this.''

<HEADLINE> Five Shot to Death in Missouri Home  </HEADLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER CLARK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARRENSBURG, Mo. (AP) -- A woman and four of her children were found shot to
death at their home Monday. Two of the woman's other children, an infant and a
3-year-old girl, also were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The two girls were expected to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were shot with some type of rifle,'' said Pat Leighter, a spokeswoman
for the Johnson County Sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
	   A man was taken into custody Monday at the scene of the shooting but police
would not release his name nor his relationship to the victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Leighter said the sheriff's office got a 911 call about a disturbance at the
family's home built into the side of a hill in Warrensburg, about 50 miles
southeast of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were identified as Tina Wood, 31, Jared, 10, Joshua, 8, Emily,
7, and Hanna, 5.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings occurred in a rural, heavily wooded area off a dirt road.
Sheriff's cars guarded the driveway leading into the property Monday as chickens
and geese roamed across the yard.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors said the family lived in an earth contact home, a ``partially
underground shelter,'' about a quarter-mile off the road. The energy-saving
homes are common in this area.
</P>
<P>
	   Della Davis described the family as religious and said the children were
often seen bicycling and fishing at a nearby pond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You couldn't come across sweeter people,'' Davis said. ``If I needed
anything they were here for me.''

<HEADLINE> Mrs. Clinton Picks Up Irish Award  </HEADLINE>
   By SHANNON McCAFFREY Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Hillary Rodham Clinton picked up an award Monday for her
work on the peace process in northern Ireland and helped raise cash for a group
of Irish Democrats.
</P>
<P>
	   The $500-a-head fund-raiser at the Georgetown home of Elizabeth Frawley
Bagley, a former U.S. ambassador to Portugal, benefited the Irish American
Democrats, a political action committee.
</P>
<P>
	   The group's director, Stella O'Leary, said she expected to spend the maximum
allowable $10,000 on the first lady's Senate bid and would also spend money on
Al Gore's presidential run.
</P>
<P>
	   ``This tonight will benefit Hillary's campaign,'' Bagley told about 100
guests.
</P>
<P>
	   The event was billed as an official White House function and at least one
White House staffer attended with Clinton. Candidates for federal office are
barred from using official staff for campaign-related events like fund raising.
</P>
<P>
	   But Clinton's campaign spokesman Howard Wolfson maintained the fund-raiser
was for the Irish American Democrats. ``We have no control over how they spend
their money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   O'Leary said the group would hold another fund-raiser for Clinton on St.
Patrick's Day.
</P>
<P>
	   The award comes after the first lady ran into trouble with the Irish
community by agreeing to march in New York City's St. Patrick's Day Parade. Many
Democrats avoid the parade because it excludes the Irish Lesbian and Gay
Organization. Clinton's likely Senate rival, Republican New York Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani, always marches.
</P>
<P>
	   The award also comes as the peace process in northern Ireland is in
jeopardy. Clinton said the setback was ``a bump in the road but it's going to be
resolved.''

<HEADLINE> 17 Hurt in Calif. Highway Pileup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN BERNARDINO, Calif. (AP) -- At least 63 vehicles collided in a
chain-reaction pileup Monday, injuring 15 people on a fog-shrouded section of
Interstate 15.
</P>
<P>
	   Four of the injured were in serious condition, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
	   Visibility in the fog was less than 100 feet and the pavement was wet, so
motorists had no time to react to collisions in front of them, California
Highway Patrol investigators said. The posted speed limit is 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   The 8:30 a.m. crash involved 58 cars and five big-rigs in the southbound
lanes at the 4,000-foot level near Cajon Summit, said patrol officer Kevin
Haney. Most of the damage was of the fender-bender variety.
</P>
<P>
	   Motorist Bruce Freeman said he encountered visibility down to 20 feet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I came to a stop and this gal came screaming down the hill doing about 65
or 70 mph and spun out of control, clipped us and wiped out another vehicle and
sent two people to the hospital,'' Freeman said.
</P>
<P>
	   Fog lifted by late morning in the area 60 miles east of downtown Los
Angeles. The southbound lanes of the interstate reopened about 12:30 p.m.

<HEADLINE> BP Amoco-Arco Merger Hearing Planned  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- A federal judge has scheduled a seven-day hearing next
month on the government's attempt to block BP Amoco's $30 billion acquisition of
fellow oil giant Atlantic Richfield Co.
</P>
<P>
	   U.S. District Judge Susan Illston set the hearing to start the week of March
20, 10 days later than her previous schedule. She will decide later this month
whether to consolidate the case with suits by the states of California, Oregon
and Washington, also opposing the merger, and whether to let Alaska enter the
case on the oil companies' side.
</P>
<P>
	   The Federal Trade Commission is seeking a preliminary injunction to stop the
merger, arguing that it would give the new company virtual control of Alaska
crude oil supplies to West Coast refineries. Increased prices would be the
likely result, the FTC contends.
</P>
<P>
	   The companies say the merger would encourage oil production and would have
no effect on oil prices, which they maintain are controlled by the international
market.
</P>
<P>
	   The state of Alaska argues that any concerns about competition should be
satisfied with the two companies' agreement to sell some of their Alaska oil
holdings, reducing their combined share of the state's oil production from 70 to
55 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The merger of London-based BP Amoco with Los Angeles-based Atlantic
Richfield would create the second largest non-government oil company, behind
Exxon Mobil.

<HEADLINE> Bush, McCain Launch Calif. Ad Blitz  </HEADLINE>
   By SCOTT LINDLAW Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Three weeks before California's presidential
primaries, Republican presidential candidates Gov. George W. Bush and Sen. John
McCain are launching aggressive television advertising efforts, their campaigns
said Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain began advertising Friday in Los Angeles, and will expand to all major
state markets on Tuesday, said communications director Dan Schnur. Bush opens
his California effort Tuesday, California chairman Gerry Parsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain, an Arizona senator, plans a biographical spot. Bush will run two ads
-- one touting his accomplishments as governor of Texas, the other criticizing
McCain for comparing his character to that of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
	   The latter spot was initially a response to an ad McCain ran in South
Carolina. McCain's ad has never appeared in California and apparently will not
because McCain pledged last week not to run any more negative ads.
</P>
<P>
	   Nevertheless, Parsky said Bush felt compelled to respond in California,
saying news of McCain's ad had reached the state.
</P>
<P>
	   Both campaigns declined to provide ad budgets or specific markets where the
commercials will run, though both described the ad campaigns as statewide.
Bush's effort will cost more than $1 million in coming days. McCain's is certain
to cost less.
</P>
<P>
	   Schnur said increased donations following McCain's landslide victory in the
New Hampshire GOP primary allowed him to expand the scope of his California
advertising.
</P>
<P>
	   But, he said, ``We're still going to be outspent by Bush in California, just
like he's outspent us in New Hampshire and South Carolina.''
</P>
<P>
	   Bush's campaign also plans an ``aggressive'' effort to telephone Republicans
to promote the Texas governor, Parsky said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schnur said McCain has committed to attending a March 2 GOP debate sponsored
by the Los Angeles Times. Parsky said the Bush campaign has not decided whether
to participate.
</P>
<P>
	   The California primaries are March 7.

<HEADLINE> Charged Hijackers Appear in Court  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- Thirteen men appeared in court Monday, charged with hijacking
of an Afghan airliner.
</P>
<P>
	   The men, ranging in age from 18 to 36, are charged with seizing an aircraft
and its passengers Feb. 6 contrary to the Aviation Security Act of 1982.
</P>
<P>
	   Southend magistrate Kevin Gray remanded all of them into police custody. The
men, who used interpreters, spoke only to confirm their names. None asked for
bail.
</P>
<P>
	   The next hearing was scheduled for March 13.
</P>
<P>
	   Police named the men as brothers Muhammad Sediqui, 36, and Mohammad Sediqui,
30; Ali Safi, 34; Mohammad Safi, 32; Abdul Showaib, 20; Mohammed Showaib, 25;
Khalil Ullah, 30; Muhammad Kazem, 27; Waheed Lufti, 22; Reshad Ahmodi, 18;
Nazamuddin Mohammidy, 26; Taimur Shah, 28, and Ghayur Abdul, 24.
</P>
<P>
	   It was not immediately clear if the men named Safi and Showaib were related.
</P>
<P>
	   The 13 men charged were among 22 who were arrested after the hijacking.
Three had been freed by Sunday without charges after questioning and six more
were freed on Monday. Another man was arrested Monday and was questioned, but
had not been charged.
</P>
<P>
	   Home Secretary Jack Straw said Monday that 69 people have formally applied
for asylum.
</P>
<P>
	   Earlier in the day, 73 of the hijacked passengers returned to Kandahar,
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ariana Airlines plane was hijacked Feb. 6 and made a series of stops in
Central Asia and Russia before landing in Britain, where police negotiated a
peaceful end to the drama on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
	   The Foreign Office said Monday that some of the asylum-seekers could be
dispersed to the United States, India and Pakistan. Discussions also were under
way with Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Romania Refuses To Pay Spill Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Work crews pulled out tons of dead, rotting
fish from the Tisza and Danube rivers on Monday, and Romania rebuffed
compensation demands from Yugoslavia and Hungary for the gold mine spill that
contaminated the rivers with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania said it, too, suffered damage when a dam at the Australian-owned
Baia Mare gold mine in northwest Romania overflowed Jan. 30, sending cyanide
pouring into streams that eventually carried the poison west. U.S. experts said
the spill rivaled one in the United States that cost $170 million to clean up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania had to suffer the most damage from the polluting company and thus
it is entitled to get compensation as Hungary and Yugoslavia are,'' said Gabriel
Dumitrascu of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia, the larger of two republics in Yugoslavia, banned the sale of most
freshwater fish Monday, and Hungary warned of long-term ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Romanians accused Hungary and Serbia of exaggerating the damage, as did
Brett Montgomery, chairman of the gold mine's owner, Esmeralda Exploration in
Perth, Australia. Montgomery said the accident had been grossly exaggerated and
he expected his company to face no compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing protective gloves, Serbian fishermen on Monday scooped dead fish
from the Danube at the Belgrade suburb of Zemun. Downstream, water pumps were
shut off in the Belgrade area town of Vinca, and authorities announced they
would deliver fresh drinking water by truck as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary and Serbia have demanded that Romania pay compensation for the
damage, and the Serbs have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not
met.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimate of the damage and that the culprits for this
tragedy be punished,'' Serb Environment Minister Bratislav Blazic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union, meanwhile, said it was ready to help Hungary and Romania
deal with the spill and would send its top environment official to assess the
damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Environment Program, after receiving a number of requests, had
asked scientists in the area to take water samples from the Danube, Europe's
longest river, said Executive Director Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the U.S.-based Mineral Policy Center said the Eastern
European spill is comparable in size and environmental impact to the 1992
Summitville mine cyanide spill in southern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alamosa River was badly contaminated when a mine pond holding thousands
of gallons of cyanide-laced water spilled into the river. The pollution killed
all life in 17 miles of the Alamosa River system. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency estimates the Colorado spill will cost $170 million in total
cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're having to re-establish an entire ecosystem,'' said Steve
D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a private group in
Washington, D.C. ``So it takes years, if not decades.''
</P>
<P>
	   The immediate risk to people who live along the rivers could remain high
long after the cyanide diminishes. D'Esposito said cyanide compounds persist in
groundwater and soils, making it necessary to test crops grown nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the short term, most or all aquatic life will die,'' he said. ``It's a
certainty that a multiyear cleanup and remediation process will be required
costing tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another environmental expert expressed optimism that the river will rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an accumulative toxin,'' said Donald Macalady, director of the
Center for Environmental Risk Assessment at the Colorado School of Mines in
Golden, Colo. ``It will take a while, but the river will recover.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cyanide has been used to extract gold from crushed rock for more than 100
years. Modern methods that mix cyanide compounds in a water-based solution can
recover nearly 100 percent of the gold, making it profitable for mining
companies to process much lower-grade ores.
</P>
<P>
	   In the body, the poison works by blocking the transport of oxygen across
cell walls, with the central nervous system being the most sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian officials said 83 tons of dead fish had been removed from the
Tisza since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that heavy metals also got into the rivers means an even worse
problem,'' said Zoltan Illes, chairman of the Hungarian parliament's Environment
Committee. ``It will poison the whole food chain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy metals, widely used in industry, are toxic even in small amounts. They
dissolve in water, and spread through the environment through groundwater and
leach into soils.

<HEADLINE> Automakers Lobby For Air Bag Rule  </HEADLINE>
    By CATHERINE STRONG Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- An air bag test proposed by federal regulators would
increase the risk of death or injury to some car passengers from the inflating
safety devices, a letter sent to President Clinton Monday by an alliance of
groups led by automakers claims.
</P>
<P>
	   The letter says the proposal to return to a 30 mph crash test "will increase
air bag risks" of death and injury to children, small women and the elderly by
requiring air bags to inflate more powerfully.
</P>
<P>
	   Nine groups signed the letter including the Alliance of Automobile
Manufacturers, the American Trauma Society, the Insurance Institute for Highway
Safety and the National Association of Governors' Highway Safety
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
	   With the 30 mph crash test, auto manufacturers feel compelled to increase
the force at which the bags inflate in order to meet government standards. But
those powerful bags have led to deaths and serious injuries for dozens of
children and short adults.
</P>
<P>
	   With a 25 mph-test, manufacturers argue they could lower the force at which
the air bags deploy and still meet government standards for certification.
</P>
<P>
	   For the last two model years, the government has not required the 30 mph
crash test, and most automakers have installed air bags that deploy with less
force. Government data shows that air bag deaths have declined sharply for those
model years.
</P>
<P>
	   Air bags have been blamed for at least 146 deaths -- mainly young, unbelted
children and some shorter women -- in low-speed crashes that they should have
survived, according to government data.
</P>
<P>
	   The proposal by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration uses a
variety of tests and a "family" of dummies instead of just the adult male, but
the 30 mph test is the most controversial and heavily lobbied. The final rule,
intended to minimize the risks of air bags while maximizing their benefits, is
due March 1, as mandated by Congress.
</P>
<P>
	   Transportation officials are considering re-adopting the 30 mph test because
some officials are concerned that air bags that inflate with less force may not
adequately protect unbelted adults in severe crashes. The department also is
considering the alternative speed of 25 mph favored by automakers.
</P>
<P>
	   Federal regulators have declined comment on the lobbying effort while they
complete the rule.
</P>
<P>
	   "If the Transportation Department adopts this requirement, air bags will be
made more powerful in many vehicles and some of the safety gains achieved in the
past few years that reduced air bag-related injuries and deaths will be lost,"
said Gloria Bergquist, spokeswoman for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers,
which represents 11 automakers including General Motors, Ford Motor,
DaimlerChrysler and Toyota.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alliance also asked this week for a meeting with White House chief of
staff John Podesta to take their case straight to the president.
</P>
<P>
	   The other groups signing the letter were the American Automobile
Association, the Association of International Automobile Manufacturers, the
Automotive Coalition for Traffic Safety and the National Safety Council.

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Schlereth To Return  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    DENVER (AP) -- Denver Broncos offensive guard Mark Schlereth said Monday he
will be back to play another year.
</P>
<P>
	   "After assessing my abilities I realize I don't have any other skills,
therefore I have decided to play," Schlereth, 34, joked in comments on KCNC-TV.
</P>
<P>
	   The 11-year veteran has been plagued by injuries and said next season could
be he last. He is coming back after a disappointing season.
</P>
<P>
	   "Even being 6-10, we were so close to being 10-6, we were a lot closer to
being good than the record shows, and I think we have a good chance to come back
and be that good team," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlereth was a Pro Bowl selection in 1991 as a member of the Washington
Redskins and in 1998 with the Broncos.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlereth came to Denver as an unrestricted free agent in 1995. He was
originally a 10th-round pick (263rd overall) out of Idaho by the Redskins in
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Schlereth underwent the 21st surgery of his career in October 1998. He had
arthroscopic knee surgery prior to that season's bye week and was back in the
starting lineup 13 days after the operation.
</P>
<P>
	   Despite being plagued by injuries, Schlereth has played in 132 games and at
one point started in 43 consecutive games.

<HEADLINE> GOP Primary Clears Court Challenge  </HEADLINE>
   By BRUCE SMITH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   COLUMBIA, S.C. (AP) -- The South Carolina Republican primary cleared two key
hurdles Monday that will permit the vote to go forward Saturday as planned.
</P>
<P>
	   Democrats had challenged the primary on grounds that the GOP would violate
federal law by not opening all polling places, especially in predominantly black
areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Under a consent agreement approved Monday by a three-judge federal panel,
the Republican Party pledged to work to open all state-designated polling places
and said it would pay state election workers to staff them, if necessary. The
panel had been scheduled to hear the case.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We asked them to open the precincts and they did and we're real pleased,''
said Jim Fitts, a Williamsburg County activist who, along with Democratic state
Rep. Todd Rutherford, had filed a complaint under the Federal Voting Rights Act.
</P>
<P>
	   The Justice Department also said Monday that it had cleared the primary.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All challenges to this election are gone,'' said Steve Hamm, the
Republican Party's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
	   State Republican Chairman Henry McMaster said the party had about 5,600
volunteers to staff 1,752 polling places. He said about 100 of the usual places
were unavailable because they would be used for other purposes Saturday and that
the party was looking for other locations.
</P>
<P>
	   He had said Friday that 300 polling places might remain closed due to a lack
of workers.
</P>
<P>
	   Party officials agreed to seek assistance from the State Election Commission
to open all available polling locations ``including the use of state designated
poll workers at polling locations'' if it couldn't get enough volunteers.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.S. Office of Personnel Management also said a voting rights examiner
would monitor Saturday's voting in 11 counties.

<HEADLINE> Five Shot to Death in Missouri Home  </HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
	   WARRENSBURG, Mo. (AP) -- A woman and four of her children were found shot to
death at their home Monday. Two of the woman's other children, an infant and a
3-year-old girl, also were shot.
</P>
<P>
	   The two girls were expected to survive.
</P>
<P>
	   ``They were shot with some type of rifle,'' said Pat Leighter, a spokeswoman
for the Johnson County Sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
	   A man was taken into custody Monday at the scene of the shooting but police
would not release his name nor his relationship to the victims.
</P>
<P>
	   Leighter said the sheriff's office got a 911 call about a disturbance at the
family's home built into the side of a hill in Warrensburg, about 50 miles
southeast of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
	   The victims were identified as Tina Wood, 31, Jared, 10, Joshua, 8, Emily,
7, and Hannah, 5.
</P>
<P>
	   The shootings occurred in a rural, heavily wooded area off a dirt road.
Sheriff's cars guarded the driveway leading into the property Monday as chickens
and geese roamed across the yard.
</P>
<P>
	   Neighbors said the family lived in an earth contact home, a ``partially
underground shelter,'' about a quarter-mile off the road. The energy-saving
homes are common in this area.
</P>
<P>
	   Della Davis described the family as religious and said the children were
often seen bicycling and fishing at a nearby pond.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You couldn't come across sweeter people,'' Davis said. ``If I needed
anything they were here for me.''

	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Tornadoes hit rural Georgia early today, killing at
least 22 people and injuring more than 100. Dozens of houses and mobile homes in
the southwest Georgia town of Camilla were flattened. The tornadoes struck
shortly after midnight. A line of thunderstorms rumbled through the Southeast,
scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia. Fourteen people died in Mitchell
County, an area dotted with cotton and peanut farms. Seven people died in

Urgent MD-80 Inspections Wind Down

	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Government had in its hands today suspect parts that
were removed from the tail sections of several MD-80 series airplanes as the
urgent inspection program for the planes wound down. The jackscrews used to move
the stabilizers were replaced in a number of planes after inspections revealed
grit or metal shavings in their lubricant, Federal Aviation Administration
officials said. Airlines were ordered Friday to inspect the planes within 72
hours, after problems were found in the jackscrew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261,
an MD-83 that crashed Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard. The military has
also been checking its planes and no problems have been found.

NASA Wary on Shuttle Fuel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA today sought to save fuel aboard space
shuttle Endeavour, with a balky thruster threatening to cut short its mapping of
Earth. According to engineers, a piece of debris may be jamming the nitrogen gas
line feeding the thruster on the tip of the 197-foot radar antenna mast. Because
of the lack of thrust, the astronauts have to fire Endeavour's jets more often
to keep the mast in the right position. Unless they can conserve fuel, the
astronauts might have to halt their mapping as much as a day early. About the
only thing astronauts can do to fix the thruster on the mast is turn the valve
for the gas line on and off in an attempt to clear the line.

Clinton Backs Social Security Bill
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton said today he would sign a Republican
bill to repeal the Social Security earnings limit for hundreds of thousands of
Americans aged 65-70. "It's the right thing to do, let's just do it," he said.
House Republicans were introducing a repeal with plans for a vote likely in
March. It's an election-year drive to eliminate the earnings penalty, which
takes $1 in Social Security benefits from seniors for every $3 they earn over a

Five Shot to Death in Missouri Home
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WARRENSBURG, Mo. (AP) -- A woman and four of her children were found shot to
death at their home today. Two of the woman's other children, an infant and a
3-year-old girl, also were shot. The two girls were expected to survive. "They
were shot with some type of rifle," said Pat Leighter, a spokeswoman for the
Johnson County Sheriff's office. A man was taken into custody Monday at the
scene of the shooting but police would not release his name nor his relationship
to the victims. The victims were identified as Tina Wood, 31, Jared, 10, Joshua,
8, Emily, 7, and Hannah, 5. The shootings occurred in a rural, heavily wooded
area off a dirt road.

</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- Connecticut broke out of its February funk for
a 59-50 victory over Seton Hall tonight. The 18th-ranked Huskies (18-6, 7-4 Big
East) had lost two of their last three games and they had to end that poor spell
on the road and against No. 23 Seton Hall (18-5, 10-3), which had won five
straight games and moved into the national rankings earlier in the day for the
first time since 1993. Connecticut held the Pirates to 38 percent shooting
(18-for-53) and outrebounded them 44-30 in looking more like the defending
national champions and a program that had lost five conference games over the
last two seasons combined.

<HEADLINE> N.J. accuses online auctioneers of cheating Beanie Baby bidders  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   NEWARK, N.J. (AP) - Two Beanie Baby vendors are accused of defrauding
customers after 41 consumers complained to New Jersey officials about not
getting the plush collectibles they bought in online auctions.
<P>
	   The state announced Monday it has sued two Warren County men who operate the
Beanie Stars store in Hackettstown, accusing them of failing to deliver the toys
to winning bidders, or failing to send them within the required six weeks.
</P>
<P>
	   Winning bidders on the eBay auctions had to pay in advance, in one case
$618, the state Division of Consumer Affairs said.
</P>
<P>
	   Mohammad Kheiralla and Hani Kheiralla auctioned items on eBay since at least
May 1999 as "nada400" and "beaniestars," the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
	   The two brothers could not immediately be reached for comment; their store
phone was busy Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
	   Their attorney, Abe Jaloudi, said Monday night that his clients were sorting
through their records to determine which customers didn't get merchandise they
ordered. Jaloudi said the brothers have served 5,000 to 10,000 customers, and
authorities have only given them names of five who were dissatisfied.
</P>
<P>
	   "The allegations that were made against them were a bit hasty," Jaloudi
said. "We're hoping to have this resolved shortly."
</P>
<P>
	   He said the brothers "would be more than happy to ship the items or refund
the money."
</P>
<P>
	   The state is seeking restitution to consumers and fines of up to $7,500 for
each violation.
</P>
<P>
	   Division Director Mark S. Herr said the consumer protection laws on mail
order also apply to the Internet: items must be delivered within six weeks
unless arrangements are made for a later date.
</P>
<P>
	   Complaints about Internet auctions have risen to 7,500 last year from 106 in
1997, The Federal Trade Commission has reported.
</P>
<P>
	   The agency recommends buyers use credit cards to pay for online purchases.
If that is not possible, it suggests paying cash on delivery or using an escrow
service that forwards payment once the buyer confirms delivery.

<HEADLINE> Bradley accuses Gore of 'scare tactics' on health plan  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Talking tougher, Bill Bradley accused Al Gore on
Monday of employing "scare tactics" to discredit his health care plan and said
the vice president's leadership on the environment has been little more than
"window dressing."
<P>
	   Gore, a continent away, focused on education and black voters. He promoted
his ideas for college tuition help in Rochester, N.Y., then headed to Brooklyn
to address students at Medgar Evers College, named for the slain civil rights
leader.
</P>
<P>
	   In San Francisco, Bradley called Gore's latest charges against his health
care proposals "the worst use of scare tactics I've seen in years."
</P>
<P>
	   "It made my blood boil," he said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley was in northern California to announce a plan to preserve ecosystems
and to try and undercut Gore's image as an environmentalist.
</P>
<P>
	   But his sharpest words were on Gore and health care, in a news conference
after the speech. He responded to Gore's assertion over the weekend, in an
interview with The San Francisco Chronicle, that Bradley's health plan would
leave thousands of people with diseases such as AIDS without coverage - an
incendiary charge in the Bay Area, which has a large gay community.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore "should be ashamed," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley has proposed replacing Medicaid with subsidies so that the poor and
disabled could buy their own insurance.
</P>
<P>
	   He argued his proposal would serve AIDS patients and the poor better than
Gore's because it would allow them to sign up for the same coverage given to
federal employees - a plan that prohibits discrimination on the basis of
pre-existing conditions.
</P>
<P>
	   Some AIDS patients currently cannot sign up for private coverage because of
their disease, Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Local officials, gay activists and an AIDS patient, Jeff Sheehy, joined
Bradley at the microphone to back his argument.
</P>
<P>
	   "For the vice president to try to frighten people who are in a precarious,
marginal situation causes me to have serious questions about his character,"
said Sheehy.
</P>
<P>
	   Gore campaign spokesman Chris Lehane said the vice president's criticism was
on target.
</P>
<P>
	   "The private market is not going to rush in to provide health care to these
people, certainly not for $150 a month," Lehane said, referring to an average
premium Bradley's plan would provide.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley's comments came after a weekend convention addressed by both men, at
which Gore issued a withering critique of Bradley's credentials as a Democrat.
Bradley's speech Saturday was more subdued, and he scarcely mentioned Gore as he
offered his leadership vision.
</P>
<P>
	   But Bradley said Monday that Gore's speech was "consistent with name calling
- once again, he called me names - and I think that demeans our politics. You
can only take it so long."
</P>
<P>
	   With the primary in California and more than a dozen other states three
weeks away, Bradley turned to an issue dear to many voters here: the
environment.
</P>
<P>
	   In a speech at the Sierra Club's national headquarters, he said the
Clinton-Gore administration has spent too little money from offshore oil
drilling royalties on protecting public lands, has prosecuted too few polluters,
has done virtually nothing to rally the public behind the "Kyoto Protocol"
climate change agreement and has failed to follow through on the Central Valley
Project Improvement Act, which sought to better balance water use in the heart
of California.
</P>
<P>
	   "That is not leadership, it's window dressing," Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley promised if elected to halt all oil drilling off the coast of
California. Gore has pledged to do the same, but Bradley questioned why Gore
couldn't dissuade Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt from extending some
three-dozen offshore leases to petroleum companies last year.
</P>
<P>
	   Mary Nichols, California's resources director, told reporters in a telephone
conference call that Babbitt had no choice in the matter after Interior's top
lawyer advised him that the federal government must extend the leases. She said
there was nothing Gore could do about it.
</P>
<P>
	   "He doesn't have a record that comes close to matching Al Gore's," said
Nichols, who was an assistant administrator of the Environmental Protection
Agency from 1993-1997.
</P>
<P>
	   Bradley said he would create wilderness refuges in the ocean, similar to
those in national forests.
</P>
<P>
	   He received the endorsements Monday of Stewart Udall, who served as interior
secretary under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and of Brent Blackwelder,
president and founder of Friends of the Earth.

<HEADLINE> Two Columbine Students Shot, Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By R. UNRUH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two Columbine High sweethearts were found dead
early Monday after a shooting at a sandwich shop within sight of their school,
compounding the heartbreak in the community that suffered the worst school
shooting in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of Nicholas Kunselman, 15, and Stephanie Hart, 16, were
discovered inside the Subway shop where Kunselman worked. Investigators did not
disclose a motive but ruled out murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said the cause of death had
not been determined, and he said he did not know whether a weapon had been
found. Investigators were reviewing a videotape from a surveillance camera
inside the restaurant.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope it was just a robbery,'' said one of Kunselman's co-workers, J.J.
Hodack, 22. ``I've had more than enough of this. This stuff needs to stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting was the latest in a string of tragedies that have hit the
Denver suburb since teen-age gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12
students and a teacher at Columbine on April 20 and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes remained in session Monday, but at least 100 students stayed away.
Students said some of those who did attend could be seen crying in the hallways.
At least 25 counselors were kept busy most of the day, said Betty Fitzpatrick,
health services director for the school district.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It reminds me of everything. It's just like flashbacks,'' said Nathan
Vanderau, an 18-year-old senior who knew some of the victims of last year's
shooting as well as Monday's victims and is in counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other incidents that have added to the unease in the community:
</P>
<P>
	   -- In October, the mother of a student partially paralyzed in the massacre
shot herself to death.
</P>
<P>
	   -- On Feb. 1, the body of an 11-year-old boy was found in a trash bin within
blocks of the school. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Last week, a Florida man pleaded guilty in Denver to sending a Columbine
student an Internet message threatening to finish the massacre. The threat
prompted officials to close the school for the Christmas holidays two days
early. He faces up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends said Hart enjoyed sports but was quiet and didn't go out much except
to stop by the sub shop to see Kunselman. He had worked at the sub shop for only
a month but had won the manager's confidence and often was assigned to close the
restaurant at 10 p.m., Hodack said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, our boss trusted him. He's a good worker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Subway employee driving past the store noticed a light inside the store
about 1 a.m. Since the business was supposed to be closed, the woman stopped,
went inside and discovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   As investigators worked inside the shop about two blocks from the high
school, Columbine students and relatives of the victims gathered in the parking
lot, placing bouquets just outside police lines. They also wrote chalk memorial
messages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every week, there's something that happens here,'' said Daniel Baker, who
brought three friends to deliver flowers. ``This is supposed to be a normal
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   Courtney Scott, an 18-year-old cousin of Hart, placed a heart-shaped bouquet
of flowers with a banner reading, ``I love you,'' outside the shop. She said
Hart was not at Columbine the day of last year's shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   A school spokesman confirmed both victims attended Columbine last year but
did not know if either was there when the massacre occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   News of another shooting in Littleton resonated in the Statehouse in Denver,
where the House debated gun restrictions that were drafted in part because of
the Columbine massacre.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's horrifying to me,'' said House Minority Leader Ken Gordon, a Denver
Democrat who sponsored some of the measures. ``We are not getting it done. We
are not protecting the people of the state.''

<HEADLINE> Tornadoes Kill 22 in Georgia  </HEADLINE>
   By ELLIOTT MINOR Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early Monday,
ripping people from their beds and piling up mobile homes. At least 22 people
were killed and more than 100 were hurt.
</P>
<P>
	   Dozens of houses and mobile homes in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla
were flattened, their metal and siding mangled and strewn across yards and
streets.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All you heard was a roar, woo-woo-woo,'' said Johnny Jones, whose mobile
home south of Camilla was thrown on its side. He said he freed his 14-year-old
son, who was pinned under a washing machine, and they crawled out a window.
</P>
<P>
	   ``All I could see was that everything was demolished. People were hollering
and crying `Where's my child?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   The tornadoes struck shortly after midnight as a line of thunderstorms
rumbled through the Southeast, scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia.
Authorities in Camilla and surrounding Mitchell County said two separate
twisters cut a 1.5-mile-wide, 10-mile-long path through the county.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It hit the impoverished and the affluent,'' said Liz McQueen, a Red Cross
volunteer who was working at a temporary morgue near Camilla.
</P>
<P>
	   Fourteen people died in Mitchell County, a primarily rural area dotted with
cotton and peanut farms, chicken processing plants, textile factories and a
state prison. Seven people died in neighboring Grady County and one in Colquitt
County. Gov. Roy Barnes, who flew over to assess the damage, declared those
three counties and nearby Tift County disaster areas.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the victims was Marianne McClelland, 64, who planned to retire from
the Grady County Health Department next month but died along with her husband,
Jackie. Their white farm house was completely gone Monday, except for twisted
pieces of wood scattered through nearby pecan fields by winds over 100 mph.
</P>
<P>
	   Marie Suzette Williams, whose 25th birthday was Monday, was one of three
people killed in one mobile home near Camilla.
</P>
<P>
	   Todd Harrell's family was getting ready to move to Florida because he got a
promotion. He survived the tornadoes, but his wife, Shannon, 28, and his
8-month-old daughter, Kylie Rae, were killed. He had been already planning to
adopt his wife's 10-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, Brittany, who
escaped with a broken arm.
</P>
<P>
	   The twisters were the deadliest in Georgia since 1936, when 203 people were
killed by tornadoes in Gainesville, northeast of Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
	   The winds snatched up the trailer where Janet and James Madeiras and their
son Travis, 12, had been sleeping, tossing them out and knocking the trailer on
top of them.
</P>
<P>
	   James Madeiras, 60, said they had just seconds to react. ``The moment I
heard it, the bed dropped down and the walls came tumbling down on top of us,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I was saying, `Oh my God!' and started digging,'' Janet Madeiras said.
``When I got outside and looked around, everything was gone. You could hear
moaning and crying.''
</P>
<P>
	   The family escaped without major injuries and moved into a shelter with
several neighbors.
</P>
<P>
	   Families of the injured and missing jammed phone lines and scrambled into
hospitals to find their loved ones. There were so many injuries, people were
sent to hospitals as far away as Tallahassee, Fla.
</P>
<P>
	   Mitchell County Hospital, with only 33 beds, was swamped with more than 120
injured people early Monday. The storms had knocked out power, and the small
staff of doctors and nurses worked under backup power from a generator, trying
to treat the wounded and find other hospitals to handle the overflow.
</P>
<P>
	   A preliminary assessment found 198 structures destroyed and more than 160
damaged, said Ed Tynes, supervisor of a Red Cross shelter in the gymnasium of
the Mitchell County Middle School. More than 5,000 people were without power.

<HEADLINE> Romania Refuses To Pay Spill Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Work crews pulled out tons of dead, rotting
fish from the Tisza and Danube rivers on Monday, and Romania rebuffed
compensation demands from Yugoslavia and Hungary for the gold mine spill that
contaminated the rivers with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania said it, too, suffered damage when a dam at the Australian-owned
Baia Mare gold mine in northwest Romania overflowed Jan. 30, sending cyanide
pouring into streams that eventually carried the poison west. U.S. experts said
the spill rivaled one in the United States that cost $170 million to clean up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania had to suffer the most damage from the polluting company and thus
it is entitled to get compensation as Hungary and Yugoslavia are,'' said Gabriel
Dumitrascu of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia, the larger of two republics in Yugoslavia, banned the sale of most
freshwater fish Monday, and Hungary warned of long-term ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Romanians accused Hungary and Serbia of exaggerating the damage, as did
Brett Montgomery, chairman of the gold mine's owner, Esmeralda Exploration in
Perth, Australia. Montgomery said the accident had been grossly exaggerated and
he expected his company to face no compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing protective gloves, Serbian fishermen on Monday scooped dead fish
from the Danube at the Belgrade suburb of Zemun. Downstream, water pumps were
shut off in the Belgrade area town of Vinca, and authorities announced they
would deliver fresh drinking water by truck as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary and Serbia have demanded that Romania pay compensation for the
damage, and the Serbs have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not
met.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimate of the damage and that the culprits for this
tragedy be punished,'' Serb Environment Minister Bratislav Blazic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union, meanwhile, said it was ready to help Hungary and Romania
deal with the spill and would send its top environment official to assess the
damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Environment Program, after receiving a number of requests, had
asked scientists in the area to take water samples from the Danube, Europe's
longest river, said Executive Director Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the U.S.-based Mineral Policy Center said the Eastern
European spill is comparable in size and environmental impact to the 1992
Summitville mine cyanide spill in southern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alamosa River was badly contaminated when a mine pond holding thousands
of gallons of cyanide-laced water spilled into the river. The pollution killed
all life in 17 miles of the Alamosa River system. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency estimates the Colorado spill will cost $170 million in total
cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're having to re-establish an entire ecosystem,'' said Steve
D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a private group in
Washington, D.C. ``So it takes years, if not decades.''
</P>
<P>
	   The immediate risk to people who live along the rivers could remain high
long after the cyanide diminishes. D'Esposito said cyanide compounds persist in
groundwater and soils, making it necessary to test crops grown nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the short term, most or all aquatic life will die,'' he said. ``It's a
certainty that a multiyear cleanup and remediation process will be required
costing tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another environmental expert expressed optimism that the river will rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an accumulative toxin,'' said Donald Macalady, director of the
Center for Environmental Risk Assessment at the Colorado School of Mines in
Golden, Colo. ``It will take a while, but the river will recover.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cyanide has been used to extract gold from crushed rock for more than 100
years. Modern methods that mix cyanide compounds in a water-based solution can
recover nearly 100 percent of the gold, making it profitable for mining
companies to process much lower-grade ores.
</P>
<P>
	   In the body, the poison works by blocking the transport of oxygen across
cell walls, with the central nervous system being the most sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian officials said 83 tons of dead fish had been removed from the
Tisza since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that heavy metals also got into the rivers means an even worse
problem,'' said Zoltan Illes, chairman of the Hungarian parliament's Environment
Committee. ``It will poison the whole food chain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy metals, widely used in industry, are toxic even in small amounts. They
dissolve in water, and spread through the environment through groundwater and
leach into soils.

<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jean-Sebastien Aubin stopped 37 shots Monday night to
lead the Pittsburgh Penguins to a 3-0 win over the Vancouver Canucks.
</P>
<P>
	   Aubin had a spectacular game on the day he became Pittsburgh's No. 1 goalie.
Tom Barrasso was granted a leave of absence to return home to Massachusetts to
spend time with his father, gravely ill with brain cancer.
</P>
<P>
	   The shutout was Aubin's second this season and fourth of his career.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins are 14-1-1 in their last 16 games with the Canucks and are
10-0-1 against them at home. Vancouver hasn't won at Pittsburgh since Jan. 7,
1989.
</P>
<P>
	   Jaromir Jagr scored his 37th goal and Robert Lang got his 19th as the
Penguins stopped a two-game winless streak (0-1-1) that followed a four-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
	   Jagr, who had just one goal in seven games, scored on a breakaway against
Felix Potvin at 14:37 of the second period.
</P>
<P>
	   Lang got his own rebound on a power play and put a shot over Potvin's
shoulder at 13:51 of the first. Lang also set up Aleksey Morozov's goal at 15:56
of the third.
</P>
<P>
	   The Penguins successfully killed a two-man disadvantage for 1:14 in the
second period. Aubin stopped three shots during the power play.
</P>
<P>
	   Penguins general manager Craig Patrick said he no idea when Barrasso will
return to the team.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canucks lost left wing Peter Schaefer to a knee injury in the first
period.
</P>
<P>
	   Vancouver had won two straight, the Canucks' first consecutive wins since
Oct. 30-Nov. 5.

<HEADLINE> Officer Cries on Stand Over Diallo  </HEADLINE>
   By TOM HAYS Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- One of the police officers who killed unarmed West
African immigrant Amadou Diallo in a barrage of 41 bullets broke into tears
Monday as he testified that he opened fire to defend his partner after seeing
Diallo reach for what looked like a gun.
</P>
<P>
	   The object turned out to be a wallet.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It was just a wallet,'' the officer, Sean Carroll said. ``I said, `Where's
the (expletive) gun?'''
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said Diallo was still breathing, and ``I held his hand and rubbed
his face'' and pleaded: ``Please, don't die.''
</P>
<P>
	   The officer also testified that he thought Diallo was wearing a bulletproof
vest because he did not immediately fall down after the shooting began.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll is on trial on murder charges along with three fellow New York City
police officers.
</P>
<P>
	   In his first public account of the shooting, Carroll said that he and his
three partners were looking for a serial rapist reported to be carrying a gun.
Carroll said that instead of stopping when the officers asked to talk to him,
Diallo walked backward and started digging in his right pocket.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I heard Officer (Edward) McMellon repeating, `Police, show us your
hands,''' Carroll said. ``We said it clearly.''
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll said that he saw Diallo start to remove a black object from his
right side. ``I just said, `Gun. He's got a gun,''' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Believing that he had just pulled and was about to fire a gun at my
partner, I fired my weapon,'' Carroll testified, taking off his glasses,
dropping his head and sobbing into a tissue.
</P>
<P>
	   On cross-examination, Carroll said he didn't know who fired the first shot.
</P>
<P>
	   Carroll, 36, said he kept shooting into the vestibule of Diallo's apartment
building in the Bronx last February because McMellon fell down and because
Diallo did not. Both Carroll and McMellon, 27, fired all 16 rounds from their
semiautomatic pistols.
</P>
<P>
	   ``At that point, I thought the individual was wearing a bulletproof vest,
that he had just shot my partner and that he didn't want to go to jail,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
	   But after Diallo finally fell, struck by 19 bullets, ``I looked down at it
and I seen it was a wallet.''
</P>
<P>
	   McMellon's testimony corroborated Carroll's account of what happened. He,
too, said he was unsure who fired the first shot. Both officers said they fired
all 16 shots from their rapid-fire pistols because Diallo did not immediately go
down.
</P>
<P>
	   Kenneth Boss, 28, and Richard Murphy, 27, also are expected to take the
stand. If convicted, they could get 25 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   The trial was moved to Albany because of pretrial publicity and protests
over the shooting of the unarmed black man by four white officers.
</P>
<P>
	   Under cross-examination, Carroll admitted Diallo did not closely resemble a
description of the rape suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   And prosecutor Donald Levin pressed Carroll on what was so suspicious about
a man standing on his front stoop. ``Looking up and down the block is not a
crime, is it officer?'' Levin asked.
</P>
<P>
	   ``No, it is not,'' the officer responded.

<HEADLINE> Polls: McCain, Bush in Dead Heat  </HEADLINE>
   By WILL LESTER Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- John McCain is seen by likely voters in South Carolina's
Republican primary Saturday as less influenced by special interest groups, while
George W. Bush is seen as more likely to carry out a conservative agenda, says a
new poll.
</P>
<P>
	   The Los Angeles Times poll released Monday shows the race in a virtual dead
heat, with Bush backed by 42 percent and McCain backed by 40 percent. The poll
included 55 percent Republicans, 27 percent independents and 18 percent
Democrats in its sample of 1,047.
</P>
<P>
	   A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll released Monday night showed Bush with an edge
over McCain, 49 percent to 42 percent, in South Carolina. A majority in the
CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll said they prefer a candidate who is not tied to the
party leaders. A third said Bush has been attacking McCain unfairly, while more
than half said he has not.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain's appeal among independents and Democrats keeps him in a close race
with Bush, who has an advantage among Republicans. In 1996, a third of voters in
South Carolina's primary were non-Republicans and two-thirds were self-described
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   In the Times poll, Bush had higher marks from potential voters on the issues
of education and being most effective at getting things done, while McCain
scored higher on foreign policy and bringing change to Washington.
</P>
<P>
	   A majority of likely voters said Bush would be the strongest nominee in
November, while a third said that about McCain. Bush and McCain about evenly
split the vote among men and women.
</P>
<P>
	   McCain turned the GOP presidential race upside down by winning the New
Hampshire primary Feb. 1. He had a 3-to-1 edge among independent voters and
finished close to Bush among Republicans.
</P>
<P>
	   South Carolina has an open GOP primary, meaning independents and Democrats
also may vote. Turnout will be key, because Republicans traditionally are more
likely to vote in their party's primary.
</P>
<P>
	   Three-fourths of those surveyed said Bush and McCain have the experience to
be president. Almost two-thirds said Bush was conservative, while just under
half called McCain a conservative and about a fourth said he was a moderate.
</P>
<P>
	   In California, another key primary state, McCain has cut Bush's lead from 45
percent to 22 percent in the last month. The poll by the Public Policy Institute
of California had Bush at 46 percent and McCain at 24 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   The Times Poll, conducted Thursday through Saturday with 1,047 people
intending to vote in the primary, has an error margin of plus or minus 3
percentage points. The CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll of 552 likely voters in the GOP
primary was taken Friday through Sunday and has an error margin of plus or minus
5 percentage points. The PPIC poll of 1,014 likely voters in the GOP primary was
taken Feb. 2-10 and has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> No.18 Conn. 59, No.23 Seton Hall 50  </HEADLINE>
    By JIM O'CONNELL AP Basketball Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. (AP) -- January had been rough for Connecticut as the
defending national champions lost three games -- one more than all last season.
</P>
<P>
	   February started even worse with two losses in four games, but the
18th-ranked Huskies may have started to turn things around Monday night with a
59-50 victory over No. 23 Seton Hall.
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut used the old reliables of defense and rebounding and a boost
from a surprising source, sophomore Ajou Deng, to snap the Pirates' five-game
winning streak and spoil the day they returned to the national rankings for the
first time since 1993.
</P>
<P>
	   "Tonight we stuck with our defense. I thought we had some fire in our eyes,"
Huskies coach Jim Calhoun said. "I thought we'd score more points. I was happy
we didn't get frustrated when we didn't. If we play defense like this we can
play with anybody in the country."
</P>
<P>
	   Connecticut (18-6, 7-4 Big East) held the Pirates to 38 percent shooting
(18-for-53) and outrebounded them 44-30 in looking more like the program that
had lost five conference games over the last two seasons combined.
</P>
<P>
	   "Losing to Notre Dame was tough and we wanted to just come out and play
hard, make a statement that we're still one of the best teams in the Big East,"
Connecticut senior forward Kevin Freeman said. "Deng gave us that extra guy
coming off the bench and it really helped. Coach talked to me about playing with
more emotion and fire. I tried to bring it out tonight. I wanted to do whatever
it would take to win."
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-10 Deng, who had been expected to provide a lot to the team that
lost All-America Richard Hamilton, had struggled but scored in double figures
each of the last two games.
</P>
<P>
	   He came up big in the second half when the Huskies took control. His jumper
with 11:17 to play gave the Huskies the lead for good at 40-39 and started a
15-2 run in which he also hit a hook shot on the baseline and blocked two shots.
</P>
<P>
	   "That's been three, four weeks in coming," Calhoun said of the play of the
native of Senegal, who also lived in England and Egypt before attending St.
Thomas More Prep in Connecticut. "He's responding to the coaching and that's not
always easy at Connecticut."
</P>
<P>
	   Freeman's free throw with 5:27 to play capped the run and made it 53-41.
Darius Lane hit a 3-pointer and made three free throws when he was fouled
attempting a 3 to get the Pirates (18-5, 10-3) within 53-47 with 3:40 left. But
the Huskies went 4-for-5 from the foul line the rest of the way, the last a free
throw that capped a three-point play for Khalid El-Amin with 25 seconds left
that made it 59-48.
</P>
<P>
	   "We needed a win so I was just trying to do anything to help," said Deng,
who had six points, five rebounds and the two blocks in 21 minutes. "I'm playing
harder, more aggressively than I was a month ago. I tried to make plays at both
ends of the court. Right now I'm hungry. I wasn't a month go."
</P>
<P>
	   Albert Mouring had 17 points for the Huskies, while Freeman had 13 points
and El-Amin 11.
</P>
<P>
	   "We played with intensity and with a purpose tonight. That's what have to
get back to," El-Amin said. "We did a great job of defending the perimeter. We
decided if they were going to beat us it would to be the other guys not the
perimeter players."
</P>
<P>
	   Lane finished with 17 points for the Pirates but was just 3-of-10 from
3-point range as the Huskies forced him a step farther from the basket than he
seems comfortable shooting from.
</P>
<P>
	   "It was very frustrating," Lane said. "I thought we were coming back on them
several times but we couldn't get the big basket and they just played us tough.
We didn't rebound, get our shots or get the loose balls tonight. They're a great
defensive team and they played great tonight but when we got good looks we
didn't hit our shots and that made the difference."
</P>
<P>
	   The victory was the Huskies' 13th in their last 14 meetings with Seton Hall.
Connecticut won the earlier game this season, 66-56.
</P>
<P>
	   "Certainly you could the affects of our playing five games in 10 days but
that takes nothing away from Connecticut," Seton Hall coach Tommy Amaker said.
"We had the shots but we had to work so hard to get those shots. They locked us
up as the expression goes."

<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The dollar was higher against the yen Tuesday morning on
purchases by Japanese banks and U.S. funds. The Tokyo stock market's main index
rose slightly.
</P>
<P>
	   The dollar bought 108.84 yen, up 0.52 yen from late Monday in Tokyo and also
marginally higher than its late New York level of 108.83 yen.
</P>
<P>
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 4.42 points, or 0.02
percent, to 19,560.88 at the end of the morning session. On Monday, the average
closed down 153.56 points, or 0.78 percent.
</P>
<P>
	   In currency dealings, the dollar retained its strength against the yen as
Japanese bank dealers and some U.S. funds covered their short, or oversold
positions.
</P>
<P>
	   In other currencies, the euro was traded at 106.46 yen, down from 107.04 yen
late Monday in Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
	   On the stock market, prices started higher on buying of high technology
issues in line with gains in their U.S. counterparts in New York.
</P>
<P>
	   But traders said selling pressure emerged later amid a lack of major
market-moving news. The Nikkei index managed to remain in positive territory
because of a technical rebound, traders said.
</P>
<P>
	   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 94.63 points, or 0.9
percent, to close at 10,519.84 on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   In Tokyo, bank stocks were among morning losers as shares fell following
media reports Monday night that the Tokyo Metropolitan government would go ahead
with a tax on major Tokyo-based banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The five-year plan, proposed by Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara, calls for a 3
percent tax imposed on the gross operating profits of banks with deposits and
equivalent funds of $47 billion (5 trillion yen) or more, starting in April.
</P>
<P>
	   Ishihara, who wants to improve Tokyo's revenue shortfall, was to present a
bill to parties in the city assembly Wednesday, with approval expected by late
March, the national Asahi newspaper reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was down 5.76 points, or 0.34 percent, to 1,711.65. The TOPIX closed
down 12.06 points, or 0.70 percent, the day before.
</P>
<P>
	   The yield on the benchmark 10-year Japanese government bond fell to 1.8050
percent from Monday's finish of 1.8300 percent. Its price rose 0.21 point to
99.10.

<P>
    TORONTO (AP) -- Ron Francis scored two goals and sparked Carolina's
four-goal outburst in the first 14 minutes Monday night to lead the Hurricanes
to a 5-2 victory over the struggling Toronto Maple Leafs.
</P>
<P>
	   Dave Karpa, Glen Wesley and Rod Brind'Amour also scored for Carolina, who
won their third straight game. Robert Kron had two assists for the Hurricanes
and Arturs Irbe made 20 saves, including stopping Kevyn Adams on a breakaway
4:02 into the third.
</P>
<P>
	   The Leafs, who slipped 11 points behind New Jersey for the NHL's best
record, lost their fourth straight for the first time since April 1998. Toronto
is still in first place in the Northeast Division, six points ahead of Ottawa.
</P>
<P>
	   Nik Antropov and Alexander Karpovtsev scored for Toronto. Curtis Joseph, who
has struggled since Christmas, had a dismal outing stopping only 28 of 33 shots.
</P>
<P>
	   The Leafs, who hadn't lost to the Hurricanes in five games (3-0-2), trailed
2-0 for the 10th time in their last 13 games and it only took 4:06 on Monday.
Wesley scored on a wide-open slap shot from the point that Joseph misplayed and
Karpa also scored from the point.
</P>
<P>
	   The Leafs responded when Antropov converted a rebound off a Darcy Tucker
shot at 5:37 and Karpovtsev tied it midway through the period on a power play
with a wrist shot from the point that fooled Irbe.
</P>
<P>
	   But the Hurricanes kept the pressure on as Francis deflected a shot in front
and Brind'Amour made it 4-2 on Carolina's 10th shot. Brind'Amour, who has
struggled since coming over from Philadelphia for Keith Primeau, sneaked through
three Leafs and put a nice deke on Joseph at 13:51 for his third point in nine
games with the Hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
	   Francis snapped a shot past Joseph at 13:58 of the second, putting the game
out of reach.

<HEADLINE> Jury selection begins for Trenton man accused of strangling  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
    	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Jury selection began Monday for a Trenton man who
faces the death penalty for allegedly sodomizing and strangling four
prostitutes.
<P>
	   Anthony Balaam, 34, confessed to killing the four women over a two-year
period during exchanges of sex for drugs, police have said. Balaam was charged
with the murders after his arrest in August 1996.
</P>
<P>
	   Over the next six to eight weeks, Superior Court Judge Thomas P. Kelly is
expected to excuse at least half of the 590 potential jurors who say they would
suffer a hardship, such as loss of wages, or have planned vacations or other
conflicts during the lengthy process. Kelly excused about 50 out of 100 people
Monday, an official said.
</P>
<P>
	   The remaining potential jurors will be whittled down to 12 jurors and four
alternates during the interviewing phase. The trial is expected to begin May 1,
and last about two months.
</P>
<P>
	   Balaam opted for the lengthy trial, refusing a plea bargain in which he was
offered a 120-year minimum term.
</P>
<P>
	   Assistant Prosecutor Brian McCauley told The Trentonian of Trenton in
Monday's edition that Balaam is linked to all four women by DNA evidence and a
confession.
</P>

    WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (AP) -- Georgia Schweitzer and Missy West scored 12
points each Monday night as No. 14 Duke routed Wake Forest 69-38.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blue Devils (20-4, 9-3 Atlantic Coast Conference) held Wake Forest to
just 28 percent shooting from the field for the game and 18 second-half points.
</P>
<P>
	   The Demon Deacons (6-17, 2-10) were ahead 14-12 after Janae Whiteside's
running jumper 9:15 into the game. But Duke went on a 15-6 run to close the
half.
</P>
<P>
	   The Blue Devils stifled any chance Wake Forest had of closing the gap in the
second half with a 19-6 run, going ahead 46-26 on West's layup with 12:17
remaining.

<HEADLINE> No. 13 Tulsa 75, Rice 33  </HEADLINE>
    By KELLY KURT Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TULSA, Okla. (AP) -- Rice had more turnovers than points against No. 13
Tulsa on Monday night, and the Golden Hurricane beat the Owls 75-33.
</P>
<P>
	   Eric Coley scored 18 points and had eight steals as Tulsa (23-2, 8-1 Western
Athletic Conference) forced 35 turnovers. Rice (4-17, 0-9) lost its 13th
straight game.
</P>
<P>
	   Coley's 263rd career steal, leading to a dunk with 8 1/2 minutes to play,
broke Tim Hardaway's conference record for steals. Hardaway, a star guard for
the Miami Heat, set the record for Texas El-Paso from 1986-89.
</P>
<P>
	   Marcus Hill added 11 points, including a 3-pointer in a 15-0 run in the
first-half that gave Tulsa a 19-4 lead.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice, on its longest losing streak since losing 18 straight in the 1975-76
season, scored only two points in the first 7 1/2 minutes. The Owls, playing
without three injured starters, shot 27 percent for the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Alex Bougaieff led Rice with 12 points and 12 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
	   Rice's 33 points equals the least allowed by Tulsa since the Golden

<HEADLINE> Canadiens 4, Panthers 1  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    MONTREAL (AP) -- Jesse Belanger scored a pair of goals -- his first in the
NHL in almost four years -- and added two assists to lead the Montreal Canadiens
to a 4-1 win over the Florida Panthers on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   Belanger, recalled from Quebec of the AHL prior to the game, hadn't scored
in the NHL since April 6, 1995, when he was with the Vancouver Canucks. Belanger
was also a member of the Stanley Cup champion Canadiens in 1992-93.
</P>
<P>
	   Craig Darby and Sergei Zholtok also scored for Montreal.
</P>
<P>
	   Pavel Bure scored his league-leading 40th goal for the Panthers.
</P>
<P>
	   After Bure gave Florida a 1-0 lead 7:51 in, Belanger deked past Panthers
defenseman Lance Pitlick and goalie Mike Vernon at 14:57 to tie it.
</P>
<P>
	   Belanger assisted on Darby's goal at 8:03 of the second and backhanded
Darby's pass over Vernon at 16:11 to make it 3-1.
</P>
<P>
	   Belanger, who had one assist in three previous games this season, got his
second assist of the game 6:40 into the third on Zholtok's power-play goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal defenseman Igor Ulanov had two assists and was ejected late in the
second for a vicious elbow on Peter Worrell. Ulanov blindsided Worrell beside
the Canadiens net after the Florida forward knocked down Montreal goalie Jeff
Hackett along the boards. Worrell and teammate Paul Laus were also ejected.
</P>
<P>
	   The Canadiens were forced to dress eight defensemen when Benoit Brunet was
scratched from the lineup prior to the game.
</P>
<P>
	   Montreal outshot Florida 34-16.

Tornadoes Kill 22 in Rural Georgia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- Tornadoes descended on rural Georgia early today,
killing at least 22 people and injuring more than 100. Dozens of houses and
mobile homes in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla were flattened. The
tornadoes struck shortly after midnight. A line of thunderstorms rumbled through
the Southeast, scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia. Fourteen people died
in Mitchell County, an area dotted with cotton and peanut farms. Seven people
died in neighboring Grady County and one in Colquitt County.

Urgent MD-80 Inspections Wind Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government had in its hands today suspect parts that
were removed from the tail sections of several MD-80 series airplanes as the
urgent inspection program for the planes wound down. The jackscrews used to move
the stabilizers were replaced in a number of planes after inspections revealed
grit or metal shavings in their lubricant, Federal Aviation Administration
officials said. Airlines were ordered Friday to inspect the planes within 72
hours, after problems were found in the jackscrew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261,
an MD-83 that crashed Jan. 31, killing all 88 people aboard. The military has
also been checking its planes and no problems have been found.

NASA Wary on Shuttle Fuel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA today sought to save fuel aboard space
shuttle Endeavour, with a balky thruster threatening to cut short its mapping of
Earth. According to engineers, a piece of debris may be jamming the nitrogen gas
line feeding the thruster on the tip of the 197-foot radar antenna mast. Because
of the lack of thrust, the astronauts have to fire Endeavour's jets more often
to keep the mast in the right position. Unless they can conserve fuel, the
astronauts might have to halt their mapping as much as a day early. About the
only thing astronauts can do to fix the thruster on the mast is turn the valve
for the gas line on and off in an attempt to clear the line.

dead early today after a shooting at a sandwich shop within sight of their
school, the scene of the worst school shooting in U.S. history. The bodies of
Nicholas Kunselman, 15, and Stephanie Hart, 16, were discovered inside the
Subway shop where he worked. Investigators did not disclose a motive but ruled
out murder-suicide. Two teen-age gunmen killed 12 students and a teacher at
Columbine High School on April 20, 1999 and then committed suicide.

3-year-old girl, also were shot. The two girls were expected to survive. "They
were shot with some type of rifle," said Pat Leighter, a spokeswoman for the
Johnson County Sheriff's office. A man was taken into custody today at the scene
of the shooting but police would not release his name nor his relationship to
the victims. The victims were identified as Tina Wood, 31, Jared, 10, Joshua, 8,

<HEADLINE> Japan Seeks Tokyo Tax Plan Talks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
    TOKYO (AP) -- The central government is seeking further talks with the Tokyo
Metropolitan government over its plan for a new tax on banks.
</P>
<P>
	   The plan, proposed last week by Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara, would impose a
tax of up to 3 percent of profits of banks operating in Tokyo. It immediately
drew fire from the nation's troubled banking industry as well as the government.
</P>
<P>
	   Chief Cabinet Secretary Mikio Aoki said Tuesday he had instructed the home
affairs minister to arrange a meeting with Tokyo officials as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
	   He said the meeting would be "to explain the central government's position
and the possible effects on other local governments."
</P>
<P>
	   Talks between the taxation bureau heads of the central and Tokyo governments
were held last week.
</P>
<P>
	   The government fears the tax could further damage the banking industry,
already reeling from years of grappling with massive bad loans left over from
Japan's asset-inflated "bubble" economy.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tokyo proposal, to be submitted to its legislature on Wednesday, would
require about 30 of the top banks in Tokyo to pay a special tax starting April
1. They would have to continue paying for 5 years.
</P>
<P>
	   Most major banks have not been paying corporate taxes over the past two or
three years because of losses linked to the writing off of bad loans.
</P>
<P>
	   The Tokyo proposal, however, targets gross operating profits, or profits
plus costs, meaning the metropolitan government could collect the tax even if a
bank posted a net loss.
</P>
<P>
	   Tokyo, now facing a $6.4 billion budget deficit, says it could get about $1
billion a year from the plan.

crash Monday. He was 48.
</P>
<P>
	   Bettenhausen, his wife, Shirley, and two men were killed when the plane
crashed on a farm some 30 miles from Lexington.
</P>
<P>
	   Bettenhausen, one of three racing brothers, drove Indy cars from 1979 to 93,

<P>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) -- Ognian Doinov, a close ally of former Communist
dictator Todor Zhivkov who held key posts in his administration for 14 years,

eczema, that health became of critical importance.
</P>
<P>
	   Later, Groff and his wife, Viola, ran a store in the Crystal Palace Market,
selling bulk grains, molasses, brewer's yeast, fresh carrot juice and the

	   McMahan was well-known for his Little Dixie style that encouraged people to
dance to his fast, beat-filled tunes.

that when the Missouri State Old-Time Fiddlers Association resumed statewide
competition in 1979, McMahan won the championship the first three years.
</P>
<P>
	   In 1990, Marshall coordinated the production of an album, ``Now That's a
Good Tune: Masters of Traditional Missouri Fiddling,'' that featured McMahan and

<HEADLINE> Skating Coach Accused of Harassment  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY WILNER-
AP Sports Writer-
<TEXT>
<P>
	Bob Young, a figure skating coach and the executive director and general
manager of the International Skating Center of Connecticut, has been accused of
sexual harassment by a former student.
</P>
<P>
	Jessica Roos filed depositions earlier this month with the Connecticut
Commission on Human Rights and Opportunities in Hartford, an administrator at
the commission confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
	``I'm hoping this would help stop him,'' Roos said.
</P>
<P>
	Roos is a singles skater who trained in Massachusetts with Evy and Mary
Scotvold -- coaches of Nancy Kerrigan and Paul Wylie. She moved to Young's
Simsbury, Conn., rink when it opened in fall 1994, and it was during her time
there the misconduct occurred, she said.
</P>
<P>
	Roos no longer skates competitively and is coaching in Cromwell, Conn.
</P>
<P>
	Telephone messages left with Young's office were not returned Monday.
</P>
<P>
	No grievance against Young has been filed with the Professional Skaters
Association, said Carole Shulman, executive director of the organization that
certifies coaching in U.S. figure skating.
</P>
<P>
	Shulman said she was aware of the charges filed by Roos, who sent a copy of her
affidavit filed with the Connecticut commission to the PSA and the U.S. Figure
Skating Association.
</P>
<P>
	A spokesperson at the USFSA said the organization was aware of Roos' complaint,
but no action has been taken on it.
</P>
<P>
	Young coached a junior dance team that won a silver medal last week at the
national championships. His skating center is the home rink for Oksana Baiul,
Viktor Petrenko and Ekaterina Gordeeva.

<TEXT>
<P>
    PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The Pittsburgh Steelers wasted no time in replacing
defensive lineman Orpheus Roye, signing Cincinnati free agent Kimo von Oelhoffen
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
	   The 6-foot-4, 305-pound nose tackle started five games last season for the
Bengals. He had 24 tackles, four sacks and a fumble recovery.
</P>
<P>
	   "Kimo has been a productive and versatile player throughout his career, and
we believe he will be a solid contributor for us," Steelers coach Bill Cowher
said.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Oelhoffen signed a four-year, $10 million contract.
</P>
<P>
	   A sixth round draft pick in 1994, von Oelhoffen played 80 games in six years
with Cincinnati and started 36, including all 16 games in the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
	   Von Oelhoffen could replace Joel Steed, who is coming off knee surgery and
is due to make $3 million in each of the next two seasons.
</P>
<P>
	   Roye signed a six-year, $18 million contract Saturday with the Cleveland
Browns.

<HEADLINE> No. 20 Oklahoma 62, Nebraska 54  </HEADLINE>
    By DOUG ALDEN Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- J.R. Raymond scored 14 points, including a clutch
3-pointer in the final minute, as No. 20 Oklahoma held off Nebraska 62-54 on
Monday night.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners (20-4, 8-3) won despite their second-lowest point total of the
season and an off night by leading scorer Eduardo Najera. The senior forward,
who is second in the Big 12 in scoring at 19.4 points per game, finished with 10
points.
</P>
<P>
	   Najera also had 13 rebounds to lead the Sooners, who outrebounded Nebraska
42-36. Nolan Johnson also scored 14 and Tim Heskett finished with 10 points for
Oklahoma.
</P>
<P>
	   The 62 points were the Sooners' fewest since a 72-57 loss to Cincinnati on
Dec. 22. Oklahoma snapped a two-game losing streak against Nebraska and won for
the sixth time in seven games.
</P>
<P>
	   Larry Florence scored 17 points to lead Nebraska (10-14, 3-8), which fell to
0-5 against Top 25 teams this season. The Cornhuskers have two more ranked
opponents in a row coming up in No. 8 Oklahoma State and No. 24 Kansas.
</P>
<P>
	   Nebraska, which trailed by six at halftime, didn't let Oklahoma pull away in
the second half. The Sooners' largest lead of the half was nine, and every time
they got up by that much Nebraska would hack away at it.
</P>
<P>
	   Cary Cochran's 3-pointer pulled Nebraska within 53-49 with 3:55 left to
play. After Johnson hit a free throw, he was called for an offensive foul, his
fifth, putting Steffon Bradford on the free-throw line. Bradford hit the first
and missed the second, but Najera couldn't control the rebound and the Huskers
got the ball back.
</P>
<P>
	   Florence hit a short jumper to bring it to 54-53, but Raymond answered with
a 3 from the left wing with 48 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
	   The Sooners went 5-for-6 from the line to clinch it.
</P>
<P>
	   Oklahoma went scoreless had a 6:39 scoring drought over the end of the first
half and beginning of the second as Nebraska rallied to get back in the game
after trailing by as much as 15.
</P>
<P>
	   The Huskers closed the first half with a 9-0 run to cut the Oklahoma lead to
32-26 at halftime, then opened the second half with four straight points.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador Seeks Dollar as Currency  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   QUITO, Ecuador (AP) -- New President Gustavo Noboa asked Congress on Monday
to make the U.S. dollar Ecuador's official currency -- a key issue in the
uprising that forced the previous president from office last month.
</P>
<P>
	   The measure was included in a legislative package that also calls for the
sale of state-run telecommunications and electric companies, an effort to raise
dollar reserves.
</P>
<P>
	   The government needs to increase the amount of dollars it owns to be able to
carry out President Jamil Mahuad's plan to gradually replace Ecuadorean
currency, the sucre, with the U.S. greenback.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa has said he agrees with Mahuad's position that adopting the dollar
would curb inflation by preventing the government from printing money to meet it
budget. Supporters also say the move would bring down interest rates and spur
investment.
</P>
<P>
	   However, opposition to the dollar was central in the military-supported
Indian uprising last month that ended with Mahuad being tossed out. His
opponents also blamed him for the country's severe economic woes.
</P>
<P>
	   And polls still show more than 60 percent of Ecuadoreans reject the dollar
plan. And Indian leaders maintain it is an affront to national sovereignty and
would benefit only the rich.
</P>
<P>
	   However, analysts note the Indian groups have promised the Noboa government
several months to rekindle the economy, and the administration is counting on
that time frame for its economic moves to begin showing results.
</P>
<P>
	   Noboa designated the proposed legislation as urgent, meaning that Congress
has 30 days to approve or reject it. Otherwise the reforms go into effect
automatically.

<HEADLINE> Dr. Sam Sheppard's Trial Opens  </HEADLINE>
   By JOHN AFFLECK Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLEVELAND (AP) -- Three decades after Dr. Sam Sheppard's death, DNA evidence
will help clear his name once and for all in the 1954 slaying of his wife, a
lawyer told a jury Monday as the case that inspired TV's ``The Fugitive'' began
unfolding in court all over again.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutors countered that Sheppard probably beat his wife, Marilyn, to
death because he was an unfaithful husband enraged at being trapped in his
marriage.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We don't know what lit the match, but something caused the powder keg of
marital conflict to blow early on the morning of July 4,'' Cuyahoga County
Prosecutor William Mason said in his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
	   Sam Reese Sheppard, the doctor's son, is suing the state, claiming his
father was wrongfully imprisoned for killing his mother at the family home on
Lake Erie.
</P>
<P>
	   In a case that inspired the movie and TV series ``The Fugitive,'' the doctor
initially was convicted of murder and spent a decade in prison. But the U.S.
Supreme Court overturned the verdict because of the effects of pretrial
publicity on jurors and witnesses. Sheppard was acquitted at a retrial in 1966
and died four years later.
</P>
<P>
	   The doctor insisted all along that a bushy-haired intruder killed his wife.
</P>
<P>
	   During his opening statement, Sheppard attorney Terry Gilbert said that DNA
evidence, ``a powerful new tool,'' will show through recently discovered blood
samples that someone other than the Sheppards bled in the bedroom where she was
killed.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We are here to prove once and for all that Dr. Sheppard was innocent of
the murder of his wife,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert also said he will try to show that Richard Eberling, a former window
washer for the Sheppards, is the most likely suspect. Eberling died in 1998
while serving a life sentence for another murder.
</P>
<P>
	   The lawyer argued that Sheppard was a victim of a rush to judgment.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Sometimes things go very, very wrong and lives are ruined. When the state
makes a mistake it should be held accountable,'' Gilbert said.
</P>
<P>
	   Sheppard's lawyer at his second trial, F. Lee Bailey, was the Sheppard
team's first witness. He said he recently learned about evidence prosecutors
withheld from him, including a flashlight that could have been the murder
weapon.
</P>
<P>
	   For the younger Sheppard to win the case, six members of the eight-member
jury must decide that the majority of evidence indicates the doctor was
innocent. The younger Sheppard then could claim damages in a separate court
action.
</P>
<P>
	   In their opening statement, prosecutors said the Sheppards' marriage was
badly strained by the doctor's repeated and widely known extramarital affairs.
The weekend of her murder, Mrs. Sheppard was angry with her husband because a
house guest had been speaking about one of the doctor's lovers openly, they
said.
</P>
<P>
	   The prosecutors argued that the nature of Mrs. Sheppard's death -- she was
hit 27 times on the head and face with a blunt object -- indicate the actions of
someone in a rage, not a sexual assailant or a burglar.
</P>
<P>
	   Mason made his point by pounding some rolled-up paper into his hand and
counting the blows up to 27.
</P>
<P>
	   Prosecutor Steve Dever said Eberling was set up as the ``fall guy'' in the
early 1990s by Cynthia Cooper, who wrote a book about the case with Sam Reese
Sheppard. Cooper wanted to sell books and using Eberling as alternative suspect
made that task easier, Dever said.
</P>
<P>
	   Bailey suggested in 1966 that the Sheppards' neighbor Esther Houk might have
delivered the fatal blows after catching her husband, Spencer Houk, having sex
with Mrs. Sheppard.
</P>
<P>
	   When Dever pressed him on the theory during cross-examination, Bailey said
he knew of Eberling but did not consider him a likely suspect.
</P>
<P>
	   In addition to DNA analysis, other technology that wasn't available at the
time of the previous two trials will play a role in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
	   Gilbert used video footage from Sheppard's first trial in 1954 and slides to
illustrate his points, while prosecutors used a computer-generated model to give
a virtual representation of the path the doctor claimed to have taken the
morning of the murder.

<HEADLINE> Two Columbine Students Shot, Killed  </HEADLINE>
   By R. UNRUH Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Two Columbine High sweethearts were found dead
early Monday after a shooting at a sandwich shop within sight of their school,
compounding the heartbreak in the community that suffered the worst school
shooting in U.S. history.
</P>
<P>
	   The bodies of Nicholas Kunselman, 15, and Stephanie Hart, 16, were
discovered inside the Subway shop where Kunselman worked. Investigators did not
disclose a motive but ruled out murder-suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve Davis said the cause of death had
not been determined, and he said he did not know whether a weapon had been
found.
</P>
<P>
	   Investigators were reviewing a surveillance videotape from the restaurant,
but, without elaborating, Davis said late Monday it was unlikely to provide
clues. He also said there was no reason to believe the deaths were linked to the
Columbine massacre.
</P>
<P>
	   ``I hope it was just a robbery,'' said one of Kunselman's co-workers, J.J.
Hodack, 22. ``I've had more than enough of this. This stuff needs to stop.''
</P>
<P>
	   The shooting was the latest in a string of tragedies that have hit the
Denver suburb since teen-age gunmen Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold killed 12
students and a teacher at Columbine on April 20 and then committed suicide.
</P>
<P>
	   Classes remained in session Monday, but at least 100 students stayed away.
Students said some of those who did attend could be seen crying in the hallways.
At least 25 counselors were kept busy most of the day, said Betty Fitzpatrick,
health services director for the school district.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It reminds me of everything. It's just like flashbacks,'' said Nathan
Vanderau, an 18-year-old senior who knew some of the victims of last year's
shooting as well as Monday's victims and is in counseling.
</P>
<P>
	   Among the other incidents that have added to the unease in the community:
</P>
<P>
	   -- In October, the mother of a student partially paralyzed in the massacre
shot herself to death.
</P>
<P>
	   -- On Feb. 1, the body of an 11-year-old boy was found in a trash bin within
blocks of the school. No arrests have been made.
</P>
<P>
	   -- Last week, a Florida man pleaded guilty in Denver to sending a Columbine
student an Internet message threatening to finish the massacre. The threat
prompted officials to close the school for the Christmas holidays two days
early. He faces up to five years in prison.
</P>
<P>
	   Friends said Hart enjoyed sports but was quiet and didn't go out much except
to stop by the sub shop to see Kunselman. He had worked at the sub shop for only
a month but had won the manager's confidence and often was assigned to close the
restaurant at 10 p.m., Hodack said.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Obviously, our boss trusted him. He's a good worker,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
	   A Subway employee driving past the store noticed a light inside the store
about 1 a.m. Since the business was supposed to be closed, the woman stopped,
went inside and discovered the bodies.
</P>
<P>
	   As investigators worked inside the shop about two blocks from the high
school, Columbine students and relatives of the victims gathered in the parking
lot, placing bouquets just outside police lines. They also wrote chalk memorial
messages.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Every week, there's something that happens here,'' said Daniel Baker, who
brought three friends to deliver flowers. ``This is supposed to be a normal
community.''
</P>
<P>
	   Courtney Scott, an 18-year-old cousin of Hart, placed a heart-shaped bouquet
of flowers with a banner reading, ``I love you,'' outside the shop. She said
Hart was not at Columbine the day of last year's shooting.
</P>
<P>
	   A school spokesman confirmed both victims attended Columbine last year but
did not know if either was there when the massacre occurred.
</P>
<P>
	   News of another shooting in Littleton resonated in the Statehouse in Denver,
where the House debated gun restrictions that were drafted in part because of
the Columbine massacre.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's horrifying to me,'' said House Minority Leader Ken Gordon, a Denver
Democrat who sponsored some of the measures. ``We are not getting it done. We
are not protecting the people of the state.''

<TEXT>
<P>
    CHICAGO (AP) -- Ted Donato scored with 2:10 left in the third period Monday
night, giving the Anaheim Mighty Ducks a 4-3 win over the Chicago Blackhawks.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks tied the game 3-3 on Kip Miller's goal with 8:29 left in the game.
Donato fired the game-winner past Jocelyn Thibault from inside the right circle.
</P>
<P>
	   Donato's eighth goal of the season was his third game-winner and, with his
two assists, went over 300 points for his career. Miller also had two assists
for Anaheim, which beat Chicago for the fifth time in the last seven meetings
between the teams.
</P>
<P>
	   Tony Amonte recorded his fourth two-goal game of the season and Dean
McAmmond added a goal for the Blackhawks, who lost to the Ducks for the third
time this season.
</P>
<P>
	   Matt Cullen and Steve Rucchin also scored for Anaheim, which won for the
fourth time in seven road games.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte gave Chicago a 2-1 lead with less than one second remaining in the
first period when he stuffed in a Boris Mironov pass from just outside the
crease.
</P>
<P>
	   Rucchin tied the game with a power-play goal with 10:18 left in the second.
Anaheim has scored a power-play goal in eight straight games.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte's second goal was shorthanded with 9:04 left in the second period and
the score tied 2-2. Amonte stole the puck from defenseman Fredrick Olausson deep
in the Ducks' end and fired a shot under the legs of goalie Dominic Roussel.
</P>
<P>
	   Amonte's goal was Chicago's fifth short-handed tally of the season.
</P>
<P>
	   The Ducks tied the game for the third time when Vitaly Vishnevski fired a
shot into a crowd from just inside the blue line with 8:29 left in the third
period. Miller deflected the shot and the puck zipped past Thibault's glove side

	   McAmmond gave the Hawks a 1-0 lead just 1:53 in when his short shot
deflected off Roussel's glove and slid across the goal line. The Ducks tied the
game just 21 seconds later when Cullen's rebound shot ricocheted off Brad
Brown's skate and past Thibault.
</P>
<P>
	   Anaheim forward Paul Kariya failed to score a point for just the second time
in 11 games. Teemu Selanne, assisted on Rucchin's goal and needs one point to
reach 700 in his career.

    MIAMI (AP) -- Peru and Haiti tied 1-1 in a first-round match of the 2000
Gold Cup Monday at the Orange Bowl.
</P>
<P>
	   A goal by Peru's Ysrael Zuniga in the 69th minute erased a 1-0 Haitian lead.
The Peruvians repeatedly attacked the Haitian goal the rest of the match but
couldn't break the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
	   Zuniga nearly gave Peru the lead in the 85th minute but the reserve forward
missed an uncontested shot on goal.
</P>
<P>
	   Haiti scored in the 61st minute, when Sebastien Vorbe drilled a point-blank
shot past Peru's goalkeeper Oscar Ibanez.
</P>
<P>
	   Haiti finished the first round of the tournament with a 0-1-1 record and one
point.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Romania Refuses To Pay Spill Costs  </HEADLINE>
   By JOVANA GEC Associated Press Writer
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Work crews pulled out tons of dead, rotting
fish from the Tisza and Danube rivers on Monday, and Romania rebuffed
compensation demands from Yugoslavia and Hungary for the gold mine spill that
contaminated the rivers with cyanide.
</P>
<P>
	   Romania said it, too, suffered damage when a dam at the Australian-owned
Baia Mare gold mine in northwest Romania overflowed Jan. 30, sending cyanide
pouring into streams that eventually carried the poison west. U.S. experts said
the spill rivaled one in the United States that cost $170 million to clean up.
</P>
<P>
	   ``Romania had to suffer the most damage from the polluting company and thus
it is entitled to get compensation as Hungary and Yugoslavia are,'' said Gabriel
Dumitrascu of the Romanian Ministry of Environment.
</P>
<P>
	   Serbia, the larger of two republics in Yugoslavia, banned the sale of most
freshwater fish Monday, and Hungary warned of long-term ecological damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The Romanians accused Hungary and Serbia of exaggerating the damage, as did
Brett Montgomery, chairman of the gold mine's owner, Esmeralda Exploration in
Perth, Australia. Montgomery said the accident had been grossly exaggerated and
he expected his company to face no compensation claims.
</P>
<P>
	   Wearing protective gloves, Serbian fishermen on Monday scooped dead fish
from the Danube at the Belgrade suburb of Zemun. Downstream, water pumps were
shut off in the Belgrade area town of Vinca, and authorities announced they
would deliver fresh drinking water by truck as a precaution.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungary and Serbia have demanded that Romania pay compensation for the
damage, and the Serbs have threatened to sue Bucharest if their demands are not
met.
</P>
<P>
	   ``We will demand an estimate of the damage and that the culprits for this
tragedy be punished,'' Serb Environment Minister Bratislav Blazic said.
</P>
<P>
	   The European Union, meanwhile, said it was ready to help Hungary and Romania
deal with the spill and would send its top environment official to assess the
damage.
</P>
<P>
	   The U.N. Environment Program, after receiving a number of requests, had
asked scientists in the area to take water samples from the Danube, Europe's
longest river, said Executive Director Klaus Toepfer.
</P>
<P>
	   The president of the U.S.-based Mineral Policy Center said the Eastern
European spill is comparable in size and environmental impact to the 1992
Summitville mine cyanide spill in southern Colorado.
</P>
<P>
	   The Alamosa River was badly contaminated when a mine pond holding thousands
of gallons of cyanide-laced water spilled into the river. The pollution killed
all life in 17 miles of the Alamosa River system. The U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency estimates the Colorado spill will cost $170 million in total
cleanup costs.
</P>
<P>
	   ``You're having to re-establish an entire ecosystem,'' said Steve
D'Esposito, president of the Mineral Policy Center, a private environmental
group in Washington, D.C., that monitors mining. ``So it takes years, if not
decades.''
</P>
<P>
	   The immediate risk to people who live along the rivers could remain high
long after the cyanide diminishes. D'Esposito said cyanide compounds persist in
groundwater and soils, making it necessary to test crops grown nearby.
</P>
<P>
	   ``In the short term, most or all aquatic life will die,'' he said. ``It's a
certainty that a multiyear cleanup and remediation process will be required
costing tens of millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
	   Another environmental expert expressed optimism that the river will rebound.
</P>
<P>
	   ``It's not an accumulative toxin,'' said Donald Macalady, director of the
Center for Environmental Risk Assessment at the Colorado School of Mines in
Golden, Colo. ``It will take a while, but the river will recover.''
</P>
<P>
	   Cyanide has been used to extract gold from crushed rock for more than 100
years. Modern methods that mix cyanide compounds in a water-based solution can
recover nearly 100 percent of the gold, making it profitable for mining
companies to process much lower-grade ores.
</P>
<P>
	   In the body, the poison works by blocking the transport of oxygen across
cell walls, with the central nervous system being the most sensitive.
</P>
<P>
	   Hungarian officials said 83 tons of dead fish had been removed from the
Tisza since Sunday.
</P>
<P>
	   ``The fact that heavy metals also got into the rivers means an even worse
problem,'' said Zoltan Illes, chairman of the Hungarian parliament's Environment
Committee. ``It will poison the whole food chain.''
</P>
<P>
	   Heavy metals, widely used in industry, are toxic even in small amounts. They
dissolve in water, and spread through the environment through groundwater and
leach into soils.

Tornadoes Kill 22 in Rural Georgia
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAMILLA, Ga. (AP) -- The deadliest tornadoes since 1936 descended on rural
Georgia early Monday, ripping people from their beds and piling up mobile homes.
At least 22 people were killed and more than 100 were hurt. Dozens of houses and
mobile homes in the southwest Georgia town of Camilla were flattened, their
metal and siding mangled and strewn across yards and streets. The tornadoes
struck shortly after midnight as a line of thunderstorms rumbled through the
Southeast, scarring property from Arkansas to Georgia. President Clinton asked
Americans to pray for the tornado victims and said the loss of life "is unusual
and terrible."

Banks Warned of Hacker Attacks
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- At least eight times, starting days before unusually
forceful attacks against major commercial Web sites, computer experts at some of
the nation's largest financial institutions received detailed warnings of
impending threats. Banking officials never passed their detailed warnings to the
FBI or other law enforcement agencies, even as alerts escalated last week from
the first assault against the Yahoo! Web site on to eBay, Amazon, Buy.Com, CNN
and others. The urgent alerts, by e-mail and pager, began fully four days before
Yahoo! fell under electronic assault Feb. 8. They cautioned that dangerous
attack software had been discovered implanted on powerful computers nationwide.
The messages ultimately identified specific Internet addresses of attacking
machines.

Urgent MD-80 Inspections Wind Down
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Suspect parts removed from the tail sections of several
MD-80 series airplanes were in government hands Monday as the urgent inspection
program for the planes wound down. The jackscrews used to move the stabilizers
were replaced in a number of planes after inspections revealed grit or metal
shavings in their lubricant, Federal Aviation Administration officials said.
Airlines were ordered Friday to inspect the planes within 72 hours, after
problems were found in the jackscrew of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, an MD-83
that crashed Jan. 31. The NTSB also reported that two years ago the jackscrew on
the crashed plane had been slated for replacement during an inspection, but a
recheck determined it operated within allowable limits so it was left in
service.

Two Columbine Students Found Dead

	   LITTLETON, Colo. (AP) -- Investigators were working on a motive after two
Columbine High sweethearts were found dead early Monday after a shooting at a
sandwich shop within sight of their school. The bodies of Nicholas Kunselman,
15, and Stephanie Hart, 16, were discovered inside the Subway shop where
Kunselman worked. Investigators were reviewing a surveillance videotape from the
restaurant, but, without elaborating, Jefferson County sheriff's spokesman Steve
Davis said late Monday it was unlikely to provide clues. He also said there was
no reason to believe the deaths were linked to the Columbine massacre.

NASA Wary on Shuttle Fuel
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
	   CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA today sought to save fuel aboard space
shuttle Endeavour, with a balky thruster threatening to cut short its mapping of
Earth. According to engineers, a piece of debris may be jamming the nitrogen gas
line feeding the thruster on the tip of the 197-foot radar antenna mast. Because
of the lack of thrust, the astronauts have to fire Endeavour's jets more often
to keep the mast in the right position. Unless they can conserve fuel, the
astronauts might have to halt their mapping as much as a day early.

	   PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jean-Sebastien Aubin stopped 37 shots tonight to lead the
Pittsburgh Penguins to a 3-0 win over the Vancouver Canucks. Aubin had a
spectacular game on the day he became Pittsburgh's No. 1 goalie. Tom Barrasso
was granted a leave of absence to return home to Massachusetts to spend time
with his father, gravely ill with brain cancer. The shutout was Aubin's second
this season and fourth of his career. Jaromir Jagr scored his 37th goal and
Robert Lang got his 19th.
