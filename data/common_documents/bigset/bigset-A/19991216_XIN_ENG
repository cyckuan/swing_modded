<HEADLINE> (Year-End Roundup)Mercosur Leads Economic Integration in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, December 15 (Xinhua)-- Globalization has been a
tendency in world economic development today. Latin American
countries are actively preparing themselves for their own
integration into regional, hemispheric spheres, in a movement
headed by the Common Southern Market (Mercosur).
</P>
<P>
Founded by the Asuncion Treaty of 1991, more that 94 percent
trade between Mercosur members, made up by Brazil, Argentina,
Uruguay and Paraguay, is carried through free from tariff barriers.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that until year 2006, an External Common Tariff(TEC)
will be set for the total tariff universe. TEC was adopted January
1, 1995.
</P>
<P>
In December 1994, the four member countries signed the Ouro
Prieto Protocol, which recognizes the juridical personality of the
block's international rights, and attributed to Mercosur
competency to negotiate accords with third countries and
international organisms.
</P>
<P>
The success of Mercosur integration and its characteristic as
an entity provided with juridical personality has guaranteed its
relevant condition on the international scene and fundamental role
and leader in external investments in the region.
</P>
<P>
In Mercosur agenda, the first step is the creating of a widened
economic space in South America, by the concluding of an agreement
of tariff preferences and of a Free Trade Accord in year 2000
between the group and the Andean Community of Nations (CAN).
</P>
<P>
Mercosur-CAN alliance will cover 300 million people, with a GDP
close to one trillion dollars, or 13 percent of the world's total,
and will make a strategic step toward the Free Trade Area of the
Americas (FTAA) expected for year 2005.
</P>
<P>
South America's integration, besides allowing to negotiate in
block with developed countries like United States and Canada, will
foment the structural reforms of South American countries assuring
competitively in industry, condition for free trade with United
States and Canada.
</P>
<P>
The next stage will be the making up process of FTAA, project
directed to the eliminating of barriers for trade and investments
in the Hemisphere, begun December 1994 at the First Americas
Summit in Miami. (to be continued)

<HEADLINE> Angolan President, U.S. Official Discuss Southern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Angolan President Jose Eduardo
dos Santos Wednesday discussed the actual political-military
situation in Angola and in the southern African region with Thomas
Pickering, visiting U. S. Under Secretary of State for Political
Affairs.
</P>
<P>
Pickering arrived here early Wednesday for a 24-hour visit with
an aim to make preparations for U.S. future policy on the issue of
Angola.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, the Angolan president has made an
analysis on the situation in Angola and southern Africa, said
Pickering.
</P>
<P>
Before his meeting with dos Santos, the U.S. official held
talks with Angolan Foreign Minister Joao Miranda, making an
evaluation on the on-going Angolan civil conflict.
</P>
<P>
According to local analysts, Pickering's visit is very
important and crucial for the Angolan government which is hoping
to restore peace and stability around the country.
</P>
<P>
They said that Pickering will later give advice to his
government on the U.S. future Angola policy which will be made
according to the actual situation.
</P>
<P>
Since the Angolan government has in the battlefields gained
advantage on the rebels of the National Union for Total
Independence of Angola (UNITA), the U.S. government recently
changed its attitude to Luanda, saying that it will support the
Angolan government for the annihilation of the rebels led by Jonas
Savimbi.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. had reportedly decided not to give Angola the
assistance and funds for clearing mines through governmental
channels after reading a report recently issued by the British
organization Global Witness.
</P>
<P>
During his brief visit to the southern African country,
Pickering will also meet with the Angolan Defense Minister Kundi
Paihama and leaders of the opposition Renovated Commission of the
UNITA.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel Resume peace Talks after Four-Year Break </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 ( Xinhua ) -- President Bill Clinton
opened historic Syrian-Israeli peace talks on Wednesday at the
White House Rose Garden with Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara standing at his side.
</P>
<P>
It was the first highest-level meeting between Syria and Israel
for a half century and also a resumption of their talks that broke
off nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Clinton launched the opening ceremony by saying that the peace
talks envisage a "big step" along the path toward peace in the
Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"What we are witnessing today is not yet peace and getting
there will require bold thinking and hard choices. But today is a
big step along the path ... for the first time in history there is
a chance of a comprehensive peace between Israel and Syria and
indeed all its neighbors," Clinton told the gathering.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Israel are scheduled to hold two days of talks with
Clinton and Secretary of State Madeleine Albright keeping a close
eye on the negotiations, which U.S. officials said would focus on
charting a course for more detailed negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Issues on agenda are expected to focus on Golan Heights,
captured by Israel during the 1967 six-day war. Syria demand
return of the Strategic heights while Israel would ask Syria to
guarantee its security while withdrawing from the heights. There
is a long way toward normalization of their relations.
</P>
<P>
Barak said at the gathering that he was determined "to do
whatever it takes" to put an end to 50 years of conflict between
the two countries and "bring about the dream of children and
mother " in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"We are determined to do whatever we can to ...bring about the
dreams of children and mothers all around the region, to see a
better future of the Middle East at the entrance to the new
millennium," Barak said.
</P>
<P>
"We came here to put behind us the horrors of war and to step
forward toward peace," he added. Barak pledged in Washington
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians in July that he
would make a painful territorial compromise" for peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
He said Israelis were aware of the "seriousness, determination
and devotion" that will be required to reach an agreement for "
different Middle East where nations are living side by side ...in
mutual respect and good neighborliness."
</P>
<P>
Shara told the gathering that the Middle East was approaching a
"moment of truth" and peace with Syria meant the return of "all
its occupied land."
</P>
<P>
"While for Israel peace will mean the end of the psychological
fear which the Israelis have been living in as a result of the
existence of occupation which is undoubtedly the source of all
adversities and wars," Shara said.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister said this round of talks "promises
for the first time the dawn of a real hoe to achieve an honorable
and just peace in the Middle East," and he insisted the
negotiations were to reopen "at the point at which they stopped,"
nearly four years ago.
</P>
<P>
After the Rose Garden ceremony, Clinton met with Barak and
Shara together for lest than 30 minutes. The president planned to
meet individually with each leader before the Barak-Shara talks
convened at Blair House the official guest residence.

LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) - London stock market ended

US tech sector.
</P>

The FTSE 100 finished off 68.3 points, or 1.02 percent, at 6633.

The fall by the UK benchmark on the session meant it now
resided some 138 points below its record high of 6772.1 set on

a loss of 34.34 points.
</P>
<P>
The electronically traded Xetra Dax in Frankfurt bucked the

<HEADLINE> France to Send Former Rwanda Minister to International Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A French court decided on
Wednesday to send a former Rwanda government minister to the U.N.
International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda in Tanzania for
allegedly taking part in the 1994 genocide in his home country.
</P>
<P>
The Chamber of Accusation of the Court of Appeal of Paris said
that former Rwanda Minister of Information, Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda,
will be sent to the Arusha-based U.N. court, which has asked for
his extradition for acts of genocide.
</P>
<P>
Jean de Dieu Kamuhanda was arrested by French police on
November 26 in a shelter for refugees in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He was a member of the Hutu interim government in Kigali during
the genocide against Tutsis and moderate Hutus from April to July
1994, in which at least half a million people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He will be the first Rwandan to be brought by France to the U.N.
court, which is in charge of putting on trial former Hutus
officials and militarymen accused of genocide.
</P>
<P>
This is expected to lead to extradition of other Rwandan Hutus
hiding in European countries like France and Belgium.

WASHINGTON, December 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The White House on
Wednesday confirmed that thirteen people suspected of planning
attacks against Americans were arrested in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
"We certainly believe these were members of (Osama) bin Laden's
organization that posed threat to Americans," White House
spokesman Joe Lockhart told reporters. But he declined to discuss
details of the arrest, other than to note that they had been
carried out by the Jordanian government.
</P>

"We are following closely a number of threats and continue to

In addition to the 13 people arrested in Jordan, Middle Eastern
countries had detained more people suspected of planning "
terrorist" attacks, according to a U.S. administration official.
But he declined to comment on the countries where the other
arrests were made.
</P>

"Some are clearly related to bin Laden, or fairly clearly.
Others are more tenuously but are somehow associated with the

<HEADLINE> Israeli Settlement Policy May Blow Up Peace Efforts:                 EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
CAIRO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) on
Wednesday warned that Israel's settlement activities may blow up
its peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting with Egyptian Foreign
Minister Amr Moussa, EU Mideast envoy Miguel Moratinos said Israeli
 settlement expansion in the occupied territories could destroy the
 confidence between the Palestinians and Israel, which he said is
essential for the progress of their negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Palestinians and Israel are under way on a
permanent peace deal by next September.
</P>
<P>
Both the EU and Egypt called on Israel to stop settlement
activities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip for the realization of
peace, Moratinos was quoted as saying by Egypt's Middle East News
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Since taking office in July, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
has approved more housing projects than his hardline predecessor,
Benjamin Netanyahu, in an average year.
</P>
<P>
Barak's move has angered and frustrated the Palestinians, who
have urged the international community to press the Jewish state
into freezing the settlement activities.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos arrived in Cairo earlier in the day. His talks with
Moussa also dealt with the Syrian-Israeli talks, which resumed
Wednesday in Washington after a 45-month freeze.
</P>
<P>
The talks will mainly discuss Israeli withdrawal from Syria's
Golan Heights, security arrangements, right to water resources and
normalization of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
"The EU intends to facilitate and support the Syrian-Israeli
negotiations," the EU envoy said.
</P>
<P>
Moratinos stressed that EU's support would not be confined to
economic aid, but could be "an effective political partnership in
some domains, with the consent of the parties involved, in order to
 reach positive results," he added.
</P>
<P>
The European Union, which wants to play a key role in mediating
 the Arab-Israeli feud, often coordinate its stance with Egypt, the
 first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with Israel and an
active mediator in the Middle East peace process.

<HEADLINE> Mozambican Ruling Party Refutes Opposition's Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique's ruling Frelimo
(Mozambique Liberation Front) Party on Wednesday dismissed the
claim by the main opposition party Renamo (Mozambique National
Resistance) that it has won the general elections.
</P>
<P>
At a Maputo press conference, Frelimo general secretary Manuel
Tome said that Renamo was making such claims because in reality it
envisaged defeat.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with a likely defeat, Renamo in despair shouts 'we've
won' in an attempt to confuse the mass media and the international
community," said Tome.
</P>
<P>
This was "just a piece of hysterics" dictated by the failure of
Renamo's attempts to secure victory by fraud, he added.
</P>
<P>
Tome warned that Renamo was "preparing an atmosphere of tension
in which any incident might spark off a chain reaction".
</P>
<P>
He called on all citizens to remain calm and serene, while
waiting for the announcement of the final results.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, Renamo spokesperson, Gulamo Jafar, projected that
the opposition Renamo leader Afonso Dhlakama will win between
51.3 and 52.5 percent of the presidential vote, while the
incumbent, Joaquim Chissano with some 47.5 to 48.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Tome said by declaring victory in advance Renamo was
"attempting to discredit the real results which only the National
Elections Commission (CNE) is empowered to proclaim".
</P>
<P>
He warned that nobody could accept that a party running in the
elections had the right to proclaim its own figures as the
definitive election results.
</P>
<P>
Tome said that "nobody will permit Renamo, with its lack of a
culture of legality, and its outlaw traditions, to be both player
and referee at the same time".
</P>
<P>
Frelimo, he added, "wishes to make it very clear to all the
Mozambican people, and to the international community, that Renamo
has not won the elections. The only institution that will proclaim
the winner of the election is the CNE".
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Frelimo would accept the final results, if they
did give victory to Renamo, Tome replied "we will accept any
result proclaimed by the CNE in strict compliance with the law".

<HEADLINE> NATO Ministers Focus on Defense Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers from the 19
members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) agreed
that development of an effective European Security and Defense
Identity(ESDI) will strengthen the transatlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
The ministers are committed to reinforcing the NATO's European
pillar, they said in a final communique of their two-day meeting
being held here at NATO headquarters in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers also reaffirmed that they support the "
development within NATO of separable but not separate capabilities
which could response to European requirements and contribute to
Alliance security".
</P>
<P>
They believe these developments "will also result in a stronger
and more balanced transatlantic relationship". The communique said
NATO has initiated discussions to address means to ensure the
development of effective mutual consultation, cooperation, and
transparency, building on the mechanisms existing between NATO and
the Western European Union, an long inert European organization
for defense policy coordinating.
</P>
<P>
The debates within NATO also include participation of non-
European Union (EU)'s European allies, as well as practical
arrangements for assured EU access to NATO planning capabilities
and for ready EU access to NATO collective assets and capabilities
on a case-by-case basis and by consensus.
</P>
<P>
"We note the European Union's decision to set a common European
headline goal and to develop collective capability goal to improve
European military capabilities," they said.
</P>
<P>
"We see these EU decisions as important steps to achieve the
goals envisaged by our heads of state and government at the
Washington Summit," they added.
</P>
<P>
During the ministerial meeting, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State
Strobe Talbott said American officials in the past have discussed
ESDI in terms of "the three D's": no decoupling of Europe's
security from that of its North American Allies; no duplication of
effort or capabilities; and no discrimination against those Allies
who are not EU members.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General George Robertson at the meeting also
reiterated a concept of "three I"s: indivisibility of the
transatlantic link, improvement of capabilities and inclusiveness
of all Allies.

<HEADLINE> China Hopes for More Universality of Landmine-Related Protocol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- It is imperative to promote the
universality of a protocol on prohibitions or restriction of the
use of landmines, said a Chinese official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The protocol represents the earliest international legal
instrument which provides for restrictions on anti-personnel
landmines (APLs) and 44 countries have ratified the protocol, said
Sha Zukang, head of the Chinese delegation, at the first annual
conference of high contracting parties to the protocol.
</P>
<P>
The protocol, the Amended Protocol on Prohibitions or
Restrictions on the Use of Mines, Booby-Traps and other Devices
annexed to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the
Use of Certain Conventional Weapons Which May be Deemed to be
Excessively Injurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects, has
played and will continue to play an important role in restricting
APLs, said Sha.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese official said, "We note with regret that,
a major problem faced by the protocol since its revision in 1996
is the lack of universality."
</P>
<P>
There are some countries which not only need APLs for self-
defense, but also are prone to be affected by landmines are yet to
accede to the protocol, Sha pointed out. In addition, some other
countries are still in the process of ratifying the protocol.
</P>
<P>
"It is common knowledge that, the legal effect and validity of
a multilateral international legal instrument, no matter how
perfect it is, will be compromised without the wide participation
by the international community," he said.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Govt Announces Economic Revival Package </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The six-point economic revival program is to stabilize and
renew the economy, reinvigorate production, build the confidence
of business sector, take the country out of debt trap and make it
more self-reliant.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said that the new plan is designed to ensure that the
economic policies have positive impacts on the common man and
their negative implications are minimized.
</P>
<P>
On poverty alleviation, the new government announced the
distribution of state land among the landless, a tax amnesty
scheme, the establishment of a micro-credit bank, tax reforms and
a benefit package for the poor and the low-paid employees.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf noted that his government had concluded debt
rescheduling agreements with several countries and commercial
creditors for more than 2.3 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
It is the intention of his government to use savings from the
debt relief for poverty alleviation and education programs, said
Musharraf.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will reactivate the privatization
program and the proceeds will be used exclusively for debt
repayment.
</P>
<P>
The domestic cost of borrowing is very high and steps are being
taken to reduce it by about two percent, said the Chief Executive,
adding that the federal and provincial governments will gradually
eliminate borrowing to finance non-development expenditure.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf called upon overseas Pakistanis to send their
remittances through official channels and said the State Bank has
been asked to take necessary steps that these remittances are paid
without any delay.
</P>
<P>
He announced the formation of a high-level committee to suggest
measures for the establishment of an efficient debt management
system and reduce debt servicing burden.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Govt to Tax Agricultural Incomes: Musharraf </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In his televised address to the nation Wednesday night,
Musharraf said that as part of the tax reform program, the
provincial governments will design appropriate mechanism to be
introduced in June next year.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said in his long-awaited economic revival package
that General Sales Tax (GST) will be applied at all stages and
hoped that all citizens will work together to ensure its
implementation.
</P>
<P>
He also said that a tax ombudsman will be appointed to look
into the complaints against tax authority while revenue benches
will be established in the high courts and the supreme court to
deal with tax disputes in consultation with respective chief
justices.
</P>
<P>
Musharraf said the tax reform program is based on the principle
of lowering the tax rates and broadening the tax base as well as
simplification of procedure.
</P>
<P>
He announced a tax amnesty scheme under which tax evaders will
be able to benefit by paying 10 percent of undisclosed assets upto
March 31 next year.
</P>
<P>
On the accountability process, Musharraf said it is on course
and the delays are due to inherent shortcomings of investigative
structure supporting the newly-established National Accountability
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
He identified these shortcomings as shortage of specialists to
investigate white-collar crimes and of qualified prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
The Chief Executive described the recovery of defaulted loans
as "a great success," saying in 45 days about 10 billion rupees (
193 million U.S. dollars) have been recovered.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- It is necessary for the
United Nations Security Council to find new means in order to
prevent and solve conflicts in Africa, China said here on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the open debate on the situation of Africa by the
Security Council, Chinese Ambassador to the United Nations, Qin
Huasun, said the Security Council dispatched a mission to East
Timor last September to study the situation on the ground which
was received very well by all parties concerned and similarly, the
Security Council can also send missions to the relevant regions of
Africa in order to carry out the study of the situation on the
ground, Qin said,
</P>
<P>
The Security Council should make further efforts in order to
tap the potentials of the existing mechanisms and resources and
the sanctions committee can play a better role in this regard, Qin
said.
</P>
<P>
The cause of African conflicts is very complicated and
therefore, efforts should be made to take care of both the
symptoms and the root causes in a balanced manner, the Ambassador
said.
</P>
<P>
Following the accomplishment of the mandate of the peacekeeping
operations, other relevant organs in the United Nations system
should play their roles properly in the building of peace, and
therefore, the Security Council should further strengthen its
exchanges and cooperation with other relevant organs of the United
Nations, he said.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Signs Mine Sale Pact with Anglo-American </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Zambia signed an agreement on
the sale of two mines with Anglo-American Consortium here
Wednesday, marking a giant step forward in the privatization of
its ailing mining sector.
</P>
<P>
The assets of Nchanga Division, Konkola Division and Nampundwe
Mine have been sold for a consideration comprising 30 million U.S.
dollars cash at close, 60 million dollars future cash payments, up
to 125 million dollars in future metal price participation.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Zambia Copper Investment, an associate
company of Anglo-American Consortium, is committed to investing
over 731 million dollars, of which 208 million dollars will be
expended on the existing operations over a period of three years
and 523 million dollars will be for the construction and
development of the Konkola Deep Mining Project.
</P>
<P>
Zambia Consolidated Copper Mines (ZCCM) will retain a 20
percent interest in the new company, while Zambia Copper
Investment will own 65 percent and its partners will together own
15 percent of the share holding of the mines.
</P>
<P>
Zambian Finance Minister Katele Kalumba said that the signing
of the mine sale agreement confirms the Zambian government's total
commitment to the privatization of the ZCCM and the liberalization
of the country's economy in general.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is convinced that the country's economy
needs to be restructured and liberalized to provide for efficient
flow of capital and other resources.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that the signing of the agreement also
signals a possibility of a speedy and successful privatization of
the remaining mines, which should stimulate new investments and
privatizations in the other sectors of the economy.
</P>
<P>
ZCCM Chairman L. Shimukowa described it as "the most important
milestone" in the privatization of the mining industry of country.
</P>
<P>
The assets involved in this sale represent some of the most
important mining operations and in terms of production it accounts
for more than 70 percent of the current ZCCM output, he said.
</P>
<P>
Copper mining earns Zambia, one of the biggest copper-producing
 countries in the world. Its earnings account for about 80 percent
of the country's total export value, and its peak annual
production hit 700,000 tons in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
However, due to copper price falls in the international market
and outdated equipment, lack of new investment and mismanagement,
Zambia's annual copper output has decreased gradually to about
300,000 tons in recent years.
</P>
<P>
To revive the mining sector, the government started to sell
ZCCM assets a few years ago to attract foreign investment and
advanced technology and management.

<HEADLINE> Lebanese Renowned Singer Acquitted of Blasphemy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A Lebanese court Wednesday
acquitted the country's renowned singer Marcel Khalife of charges
on defaming Islam by putting a Koranic verse into a song.
</P>
<P>
Judge Ghada Abou Karroum told the courtroom that the singer
didn't commit any crime and so he was cleared of all charges in a
trial seen as a test case for freedom of expression in Lebanon
which is believed the most liberal in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
"The singer sang seriously the Koranic verses and didn't attempt
 to insult the sanctity of Koran," the judge added.
</P>
<P>
Khalife, 49, one of the Arab world's most popular singers, was
accused of insulting Islam in October by including Koranic verses
in his song "Oh Father, It is I, Youssef."
</P>
<P>
The song based on a poem written by a renowned Palestinian poet
 Mahmoud Darwish in 1992 accounts the plight of Palestinians in
some Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The case was first filed in 1996 by Grand Mufti Mohammed Rashid
Qabbani, Lebanon's highest Sunni community leader, but was dropped
a short time later by the then-Prime Minister Rafik Hariri.
</P>
<P>
The trial of the singer has triggered a wave of denunciations by
 intellectuals around the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
Outside the Palace of Justice in downtown Beirut, hundreds of
Lebanese expressed their support to the leftist composer by
chanting pro-Khalife slogans.
</P>
<P>
After the trial, Khalife told reporters that he was satisfied
with the verdict and thanked all his supporters.

<HEADLINE> Malaria Remains Leading Cause of Death in Zambia: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Malaria remains a leading cause
of ill health and death in Zambia, Minister of Health David Mpamba
said here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics indicate that 12 percent to 20 percent of deaths are
due to malaria, Mpamba said at the Partners Consultative and
Sensitization Meeting on Roll Back Malaria.
</P>
<P>
Malaria cases account for 24 percent of all health center
admissions and 12 percent of hospital admissions in the southern
African country, the minister said, adding that this situation is
pathetic and cannot be allowed to continue.
</P>
<P>
"We need to identify and employ new and innovative, curative
and preventive measures that can effectively reduce the malaria
burden," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaria has become a serious menace to economic and social
development throughout the world, Mpamba pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He asked Zambia Central Board of Health to ensure that a
malaria policy is developed to guide the implementation of the
global Roll Back Malaria initiative.
</P>
<P>
The initiative was launched by the World Health Organization in
May, 1998, offering a great opportunity for joint action to tackle
the threat of malaria for human development.

<HEADLINE> China Supports Strict Compliance with Landmine Restrictions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government supports
the strict compliance with restrictions placed on anti-personal
landmines as provided in a newly-revised landmine-related protocol,
said a Chinese official here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has attached great importance to
addressing the humanitarian concerns over the civilian casualties
caused by the indiscriminate use of landmines, said head of the
Chinese delegation Sha Zukang at the first annual conference of
high contracting parties to the protocol.
</P>
<P>
"We maintain that, in addressing the humanitarian concern,
consideration should be also given to the legitimate self-defense
requirements of sovereign countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The humanitarian concern caused by the indiscriminate use of
landmines is partially attributable to the inherent lacunae of old-
types of landmines," said the Chinese official. "However, the role
played by landmines in safeguarding countries' sovereignty and
territorial integrity cannot be denied."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that it should not be overlooked that, given the
wide diversity of various countries' conditions, the levels of
weaponry they possess and their security environment also differ
greatly.
</P>
<P>
"In line with this, the Chinese delegation holds that the
amended protocol has provided the most appropriate ways and means
to address the landmine issue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Sha told the conference that the Chinese government and the
Armed Forces have strictly complied with and actively implemented
the protocol since its ratification in November 1998 of the
Amended Protocol on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of
Mines, Booby-Traps and other Devices annexed to the Convention on
Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional
Weapons Which May be Deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to Have
Indiscriminate Effects.
</P>
<P>
He said that in a bid to enhance the awareness of the public
and the army, information about the protocol has been disseminated
to both civilians and the armed forces through media and other
channels.
</P>
<P>
China is transforming and disposing the APLs which are not in
conformity with the provisions of the amended protocol. In
addition, it has undertaken some research on possible alternatives
to APLs, and has destroyed over 1.7 million old-type APLs,
according to Sha.
</P>
<P>
In order to eliminate the threat of landmines to civilians, the
Chinese government has also stepped up in its post-war demining
efforts, both domestically and internationally, he said.
</P>
<P>
From early 1992 to August 1999, the Chinese government launched
two large-scale demining operations on the Chinese territory along
the Chinese-Vietnamese border, clearing an area of over 300 square
kilometers, eliminating the threat posed to the local people by
the landmines leftover from the border conflict.
</P>
<P>
In addition, according to the provisions of the protocol on
technical cooperation and assistance, the Chinese government has
made tremendous efforts in providing international demining
assistance.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Parties of the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC) have accepted former Botswana
President Ketumile Masire as a neutral facilitator for the
political negotiations of the war-torn country.
</P>
<P>
Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU)
Salim Ahmed Salim said here Wednesday that after a series of talks
in the past eight weeks with the parties of the DRC, they have
agreed that Masire should assume the role of the neutral
facilitator for the inter- Congolese political negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The DRC parties include the DRC government and the rebel groups
-- the Rally of Congolese Democracy (RCD), the RCD Movement
Liberation, and the Movement of Liberation of Congo.
</P>
<P>
"This agreement among the Congolese parties constitutes an
important breakthrough in our efforts to implement the Lusaka
Peace Agreement.
</P>
<P>
"It creates the essential conditions for the inter-Congolese
dialog," Salim said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU leader expressed hope that all parties to the DRC
conflict will treat this agreement as a catalyst and will refrain
from taking any action in the field that will not be conducive to
the promotion of peaceful negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Annan Urges Efficient Peacekeeping in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
This is because regional organizations in Africa do not have
necessary resources, he told a Council session discussing "the U.N.
partnership with Africa".
</P>
<P>
Even the U.N. itself "lives from hand to mouth" with its own
operations forced to be financed through voluntary contributions,
the U.N. chief said.
</P>
<P>
While the world body has intensified cooperation with regional
organizations such as the Organization of African Unity (OAU), the
lack of resources leads to "a tendency for cease-fires to break
down and for the region to slide back into war," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan reiterated his call for prompt action in the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) before the fragile cease-fire is further
eroded.
</P>
<P>
Making specific suggestions on more close working relations
between U.N. and African organizations, Annan urged Council
members to "avoid giving the appearance of sporadic or purely
rhetorical reactions to crises without any follow-up".

<HEADLINE> Greece's GDP to Grow at 3.8 Percent in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Greece's gross domestic product
(GDP) is expected to grow at 3.8 percent in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters about Greece's convergence program
submitted to the European Commission Wednesday, Greek Economy and
Finance Minister Yiannos Papantoniou said that the country's GDP
growth, at 3.5 percent this year, will stand at 3.8 percent in
2000, in 2001 4.1 percent and 4.3 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The deficit will fall from the current 1.2 percent of GDP to 0.
2 percent in 2001, leading to a surplus of 0.2 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The general government debt will drop to 100.3 percent of GDP
in 2000, 99.5 percent in 2001 and 98 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Inflation, which now stands at 2.6 percent, will fall to 2.1
percent in 2000 and stabilize there for the next year before
falling marginally to 2.0 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Investment will continue to be at high levels as a percentage
of GDP. Greece's investment is already 25 percent of GDP, one of
the highest percentages in the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
Employment is expected to grow, with a consequent fall in
unemployment, which currently stands at 10.5 percent and is to
fall to 8.7 percent in 2002.
</P>
<P>
Papantoniou said that a decision on the drachma's central

<HEADLINE> Jordanian King Meets With Russian Mideast Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Abdullah Bin
Hussein met Wednesday with visiting Russian Presidential Envoy for
Middle East Affairs Vasily Sredin on the latest developments in the
 Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the king welcomed the resumption of Syrian-
Israeli talks, which he said marked a breakthrough that would open
the door for a just settlement to enable Syria and Lebanon to
restore their lands occupied by the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
Syrian-Israeli peace talks resumed Wednesday in Washington after
 a 45-month freeze and Lebanon, where Syria has been a power
broker, has also said it is willing to restart peace talks with
Israel.
</P>
<P>
Sredin, who is also Russia's deputy foreign minister, conveyed
to Abdullah a letter from Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
bilateral ties and the Middle East peace process, Jordan's official
 news agency Petra reported without disclosing further details of
the letter.
</P>
<P>
The envoy briefed the king on his talks with Syrian President
Hafez al-Assad and Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa, and stressed
that Russia would exert utmost efforts to follow up and support the
 peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, Syria and
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed appreciation for King Abdullah's efforts to
help usher in a just, durable and comprehensive peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is one of the two Arab countries, besides Egypt, that
have signed a peace treaty with Israel. For years, the kingdom has
been playing a key role in the peace process by trying to bridge
the differences between Israel and its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting the king, Sredin told reporters that Russia
wanted to be in the center of Arab-Israeli peace negotiations as a
sponsor and an active partner in the peace process, particularly on
 the Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
Russia inherited a strategic partnership with Syria from the
former Soviet Union, and Sredin's visit to the region, particularly
 to Syria, was seen as an effort by Moscow to keep alive its role
and influence in the Middle East, despite its ailing economy at
home.
</P>
<P>
Sredin arrived in Amman from Syria on Monday for a three-day
visit. He is expected to leave here for Palestinian self-rule areas
 Wednesday evening.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Business Inventories Rise 0.2 Percent in October </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
October's gain pushed total business inventories to 1.26
trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Though it marked the slowest growth in business inventories
since April when they rose by 0.2 percent, it was the ninth
straight monthly increase this year.
</P>
<P>
In September, total business inventories rose by 0.4 percent,
the fastest pace in six months.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, sales jumped by a solid 0.5 percent in October, the
largest increase since August. Sales fell by 0.2 percent in
September, the first decline since the beginning of the year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in October's sales brought the inventory-to-sales
ratio to 1.33, meaning it would take 1.33 months to exhaust
inventories at the October sales pace.
</P>
<P>
Inventories rose by 0.3 percent at wholesalers and at factories
in October, but were flat at retailers. The numbers indicate that
businesses are not hoarding goods in anticipation of the Y2K
computer changeover.
</P>
<P>
Sales were the strongest in October at wholesalers, rising 0.7
percent. They grew by 0.4 percent at factories and 0.3 percent at
retailers.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management in a survey
Tuesday said it expects the industrial sector to continue growing
strongly in and to bring in higher revenues.

<TEXT>
<P>
In a letter to a National Popular Science Conference held in
Beijing on December 14 and 15, Jiang said that in the next century
countries will increasingly rely on science and technology to
strengthen their national strength.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures should therefore be taken to improve science
and culture in China as part of the socialist modernization drive
in the 21st century, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said that scientific knowledge helps people to have a
correct outlook on life, take a correct world outlook, and inspire
them to actively engage in social practices in a creative way. He
said that popularizing science and technology is important in
revitalizing the nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang also urged government officials to take the lead in
promoting science and equip themselves with the scientific
competence to become scientific and economic experts.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged scientific and technological researchers to work
hard to make more scientific innovations, blaze new trails in
their research and actively participate in disseminating science
and technology.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the end of the two-day conference which focused on
popularizing science and fighting against superstition, vice-
premier Li Lanqing said that the fight against the evil Falun Gong
cult this year is a struggle between promoting scientific
knowledge and rooting out the pernicious influence of cults and
educating the morally ignorant.
</P>
<P>
Popularizing science should be carried out across the nation to
enlighten the people, especially farmers and the youngsters. In
this way, Falun Gong and other evil cults will be eliminated once
and for all, Li said.
</P>
<P>
Vice-premier Wen Jiabao also made a speech at the conference.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Lends 1.1 Billion Dollars to Mexico </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank announced on
Wednesday that it has approved two loans worth 1,111 million U.S.
dollars to help Mexico sustain macroeconomic stability and
restructure banking system.
</P>
<P>
An adjustment loan of 606 million dollars will be used to
support the federal government's decentralization of health and
education services, among others, to the country's state and
municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
The decentralization adjustment loan is part of a "financial
armor" package announced by the Mexican government last June,
which includes a 4.2-billion-dollar agreement with the
International Monetary Fund, as well as financing from other
international institutions.
</P>
<P>
The loan provides financing to keep the federal fiscal balance
stable, as the country undertakes an ambitious reform of financial
arrangements between the federal government and state and
municipal governments.
</P>
<P>
These reforms include market-based rules on borrowing and debt
management by sub-national governments, hard budget constraints on
federal transfers to states and municipalities, improved
administration of public finances, and better coordination between
different levels of government.
</P>
<P>
The other loan, amounting to 505 million dollars, will help
restructure and recapitalize Mexico's banking system, in order to
stimulate job creation through renewed bank lending to small and
medium-sized entrepreneurs and businesses.
</P>
<P>
The Bank Restructuring Facility Loan provides funds to Mexico's
new bank-deposit insurance agency, Instituto de Proteccion al
Ahorro Bancario, to finance part of its debt servicing needs in
2000, arising from its mandate to restructure, sell or liquidate
five banks.
</P>
<P>
The loan also supports reforms undertaken by the Commission
National Bancaria y de Valores to improve the quantity and quality
of Mexican private banks' capital, as well as to strengthen
regulatory, accounting and disclosure standards.

<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The defending champions Bayi
Rockets proved to be unstoppable as they slammed Shandong Flaming
Bulls home with a 135-111 victory Wednesday in an eighth-round
match of the Chinese Basketball Association (CBA) league in Jinan,
Shandong province.
</P>
<P>
Power forward Liu Yudong and pivot Wang Zhizhi, both are the
assured members of the national squad for the Sydney Olympics,
scored 34 points apiece for Bayi, which run 7-1 record to lead the
table.
</P>
<P>
But it was the fast Li Nan who beat Shandong up. The shooting
guard drilled in all five three-pointers and was 10-12 in the
field to contribute 27 points and 10 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
Bayi, who won the league title each year from 1995 to 1999,
made 16 three pointers and was .590 from behind the arc with even
the 2.15-meter Wang shot 2-3 for the long-range shots spree.
</P>
<P>
Shandong's top player Gong Xiaobin made one from his six
shooting attempts and was held to just two points in 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Center Ji Minshang and forward Liu Tie led the home team with
23 points each.
</P>
<P>
"We played half game," Shandong's head coach Ma Lianmin said. "
They found their attack power in the third quarter and it were Liu
Yudong and Li Nan who actually beat us."
</P>
<P>
Point guard Du Feng led Guangdong Tigers to a 83-71 home win
over Beijing Ducks with 27 points and 20 rebounds. Guangdong are
at the same 7-1 record to follow Bayi at second on the standings.
</P>
<P>
The high-flying Shanghai Sharks edged off Vanguard Aoshen on
the road, 85-75, to take a 5-3 record.

<HEADLINE> French Police Hunt Suspect of Double Murder on Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- French police have launched a
man-hunt against a suspect in two brutal murders of women which
took place on two different night trains within two months.
</P>
<P>
Police have ``half identified'' the suspect, who they described
as a 20-year-old Frenchman of Algerian origin who lived in
Marseille and had served a prison term for rape and violence.
</P>
<P>
The suspect allegedly killed two women -- a British student and
a 36-year-old mother -- on two trains in the night of October 12
and on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses, including train ticket checkers, said the suspect
was on board the train from Limoges to Paris and that from Calais
to Vintimille at the time when the murders took place.
</P>
<P>
The man was traveling without ticket on both trains, said
police.
</P>
<P>
He was suspected to have killed Isabel Peake, a British student,
and Corinne Caillaux, who was traveling with her five-year-old son.
</P>
<P>
Peake was found thrown by the side of the railway line, while
Caillaux was found stabbed by knife in a train restroom.

JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Goods and passenger

<P>
BEIJING, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese People's Institute
of Foreign Affairs (CPIFA), one of China's top non-governmental
organizations involving foreign contacts, held a reception in the
Great Hall of People here to mark the 50th anniversary of its
establishment and its newly-elected fifth council.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Vice-Premier Qian Qichen delivered a speech at the
reception. He cited the CPIFA as a "senior" non-governmental
organization, which is composed of noted Chinese personages from

military areas. It has gained fruitful experience in international
affairs studies and people-to-people contacts with other countries,
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Mei Zhaorong, president of CPIFA, addressed the reception,
saying the CPIFA was established in Beijing on December 15, 1949,
at the proposal of the late Premier Zhou Enlai. Over the past half
a century, it abided by China's foreign policy and conducted
international exchanges with foreign countries, which helped
increase mutual understanding and promote the forging of
diplomatic ties between China and many other countries.
</P>
<P>
The CPIFA maintains extensive contacts with statesmen,
diplomats, public figures, scholars and entrepreneurs in more than
130 countries. It has received over 2,100 high-level delegations
with more than 14,000 foreign guests.

<HEADLINE> Technological Change Dominates Investment in 2000's, Says American Express </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) - The two most dominant investment
themes of the next decade are likely to be technological change
and globalisation, according to the latest issue of Economics for
Investment published Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The authors of the publication identify ten themes which have
impacted investments in the 1990's and then look forward to how
they will develop in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the publication, John Calverley said
some themes, like low inflation, European integration and the
focus on shareholder value are likely to continue in the same
direction.
</P>
<P>
Others, like a recovery in Japan and an under-performing US
stock market represent a form of "mean reversion", a swing back
towards the average, he added.
</P>
<P>
According to Calverley, Chief Economist of American Express
Bank, free market reforms are expected to slow in most countries,
because the easy ones have been implemented.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless emerging markets as an asset class are expected to
perform much better in relative terms in the 2000's though helped
partly by lower long run returns in the US and Europe, Calverley
forecast.

<P>
Economics for Investment is the economics and financial
publication of American Express Bank, published in London.

<HEADLINE> Hundreds of Secret Drug Labs Seized in U.S. in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. law enforcement
agencies have seized hundreds of secret drug labs in a battle
against methamphetamine trafficking and use across the Midwest in
1999, according to a report released Wednesday by the U.S.
government.
</P>
<P>
The report, detailing the government's anti-drug efforts across
the nation, said in the first half of this year, local and federal
law enforcement seized 238 meth or "speed" labs in Kansas, 242 in
Iowa and 223 in Missouri,
</P>
<P>
"We do not just have a national drug problem. What we really
have is a series of local drug epidemics," said Barry McCaffrey,
the administration's drug policy chief.
</P>
<P>
The report has described the government's war on drugs in 31
High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas from the Mexican border to
the streets of New York. These areas have been selected over the
last decade as regions with serious drug problems that also harm
other areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the Northeast, despite dramatic drops
in crime, the New York-New Jersey area remains a "Mecca" for
narcotics trafficking. While all drugs can be found in the area,
heroin and cocaine dominate the scene because of the profits and
potential violence they generate.
</P>
<P>
In Appalachia, the area containing Kentucky, Tennessee and West
Virginia, marijuana is "the number one cash crop," the report said.
The three states produce over 1.6 million outdoor marijuana plants,
over 40 percent of the nationwide total.
</P>
<P>
Since the area was designated as a high trafficking area last
year, U.S. law enforcement agencies have made almost 2,000 arrests
and have destroyed nearly half a million marijuana plants,
according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Among the 31 high trafficking areas ranging from Hawaii to New
England, the report also found that an increasing amount of
Canadian grown marijuana is being smuggled across the border into
the United States. The Canadian police authorities estimated the
annual production at 800 tons.

<HEADLINE> Whites Still to Dominate Top Posts in S. African </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 15 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's top army
posts will continue to be dominated by whites for the foreseeable
future because of the slow pace of post-apartheid transformation,
Defence Minister Patrick Lekota has said.
</P>
<P>
"The top echelons of the South African National Defense Force
will, for the foreseeable future, be dominated by white officers
of the former South African Defense Force," Lekota said in the
latest issue of Jane's Defence Weekly, a London-based magazine.
</P>
<P>
It is clear that the transformation process -- under which
former African National Congress (ANC) and Pan Africanist Congress
(PAC) guerrillas are being incorporated into a post-apartheid
defense force -- is always difficult and takes time, said the
defense minister.
</P>
<P>
The former freedom fighters from the armed wings of the ANC and
the PAC will have to gain experience before being given positions
of command in the 90,000 professional military, he said.

<HEADLINE> China On U.N. Peacekeeping Operations In Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 15 (Xinhua) --The general principles,
the purposes and principles of the United Nations Charter,
Neutrality and self-defense as well as the prior consent of the
parties, are the main principles to be followed in order to carry
out the U.N. peacekeeping operations in a more timely and
efficiently manner, China said here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the open debate on the situation of Africa by the
United Nations Security Council, Chinese Ambassador to the U.N.,
Qin Huasun, said regarding to the peacekeeping operations in
Africa, the views of the countries concerned, the relevant
regional organizations and the U.N. Secretariat should be sought
widely beforehand when taking a decision.
</P>
<P>
The lack of guarantee for the security on the ground cannot be
taken as an excuse for taking a negative approach, and the lack of
sufficient resources have gravely impeded the normal functioning
of the peacekeeping operations, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the countries that are in arrears with the assess
peacekeeping operations to pay up their arrears in a prompt, full,
unconditional matter.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the peacekeeping operations in Sierra Leone, the
reaction of the security Council is not prompt and on the question
of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Security Council was
very hesitant, which give a rise to a lot of suspicion of double
standards, the Ambassador said.
</P>
<P>
The key here lies in whether there is the necessary political
will or not, he added.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus is Eligible Site for Syria-Israel Talks: Egyptian Official </HEADLINE>

NICOSIA, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's ambassador to Cyprus
Omar Metwally said Wednesday that Cyprus is one of the most
eligible countries to host the peace talks between Syria and
Israel, the Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Metwally told CNA that he considers the idea of Cyprus hosting
the talks as"very good" because Cyprus has close relations with
both countries.
</P>
<P>
An official press release issued here last Friday said Cyprus'
government welcomes the resumption of negotiations between Syria
and Israel.
</P>
<P>
It said Cyprus supports the efforts for a comprehensive solution
 to the Middle East problem as "overall peace in our region will
have a beneficial effect on the efforts to resolve the Cyprus
issue."
</P>
<P>
"Given its excellent traditional relations with Syria and its
excellent relations with Israel, Cyprus offers to host the
negotiations between the two friendly neighborly countries," the
press release added.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Industrial Production Rises in November </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
November's advance followed a 0.8 percent gain in October,
stronger than previously estimated, the Fed said.
</P>
<P>
Gains in output were fairly broad-based except for utilities
where, as many analysts anticipated, output fell. Unusually warm
weather in November depressed demand.
</P>
<P>
Last month, operating capacity held steady at 81 percent, the
same as in October. Generally, an operating capacity of 84 percent
would alarm economists, indicating that factories just can't
produce fast enough -- which could lead to price increases.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve will meet next week to decide whether to
boost interest rates. Many economists believe the central bank
will leave rates unchanged, citing concerns about problems that
may arise from the Y2K computer changeover.
</P>
<P>
However, the Fed is likely to bump up rates again in February
or March because the economy is still growing at a rapid pace that
could spark inflation down the road, economists said.

<TEXT>
<P>
At the gathering at the White House Rose Garden, President
Clinon launched the peace talks, calling it a "big step" along the
path of peace.
</P>
<P>
He spoke with measured optimism of a millennium-ending
comprehensive settlement between Israel and all its Arab neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara told the gathering that
peace means the return of the strategic Golan Heights, captured by
Israel during the 1967 six-day war.
</P>
<P>
He accused Israel of trying to rally sympathy for the 17,000
Jews who may be uprooted if the Golan Heights is returned to Syria.
</P>
<P>
He said more than half a million Syrian people were uprooted
from Golan villages where their forefathers lived for thousands of
years. Their homes "were totally wiped out from existence" after
Israel seized the Syrian territory.
</P>
<P>
He insisted only the return of the heights can the Israelis
live without psychological fear.
</P>
<P>
After the ceremony, Clinton met with both leaders of the two
countries -- Shara and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak --
separately. But the face-to-face talks between the two sides were
delayed.
</P>
<P>
At the State Department, spokesman James Foley said he could
not predict how the talks "are going to play out, and when they
will reach their endpoint."
</P>
<P>
"Let me make clear that we do not expect agreement on the
Israeli-Syrian track to emerge from the two days of meetings that
are envisaged and scheduled for this week," he said.

<HEADLINE> Year-Ender: Mercosur Leads Economic Integration in Latin America </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The FTAA, by reducing and eliminating barriers, will strengthen
the Organization of Americas (OAS) and the free circulation of
goods, services and capital between frontiers.
</P>
<P>
Facing different standards of development and dissimilar sizes
of Latin American economies and developed ones, particularly
compared with the United States, Mercosur insists on progressive
and balanced negotiations for the FTAA.
</P>
<P>
Mercosur affirms that in this way a possible loss of markets
for national products of Latin American countries facing U.S.
competition will be averted.
</P>
<P>
For Mercosur, the FTAA only means one of the existing ways for
the international insertion of Latin American economies in the
contemporary context. Parallel to the process of the hemisphere's
integration, the bloc has negotiated with the European Union.
</P>
<P>
The Europeans are also interested in establishing new fronts
for dispute with the United States in the field of international
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Mutual interest and economic objectives on the medium and long
term brought closer both trade blocs on both sides of the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
At the First EU-Latin America Summit held last June in Rio de
Janeiro, Mercosur and the EU analyzed the creation of a trans-
Atlantic free trade area by the year 2005, the same year the FTAA
will be put in motion.
</P>
<P>
The trans-Atlantic free trade area looks for the expansion of
its associates' economies, the strengthening of its technological
and scientific development, as well as the generating of
conditions of quality employment.
</P>
<P>
It's foreseeable that Mercosur, the EU and the Latin America-
European Union Free Trade Area will contribute to the
establishment of a fairer and more balanced relationship between
Latin America, the United States and the European Union.

<HEADLINE> Rafsanjani to Run for Majlis as Independent Candidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Former Iranian President Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani said here Wednesday that he would run for the
6th Majlis (parliament)as an independent candidate.
</P>
<P>
If elected, he said after registering his name for the
elections, he would try to help in reconstruction efforts, creating
 jobs, eliminating poverty and consolidating political development
to ensure stability, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani, current chairman of the powerful advisory State
Expediency Council, said he supports the country's reconstruction
through the Majlis.
</P>
<P>
The former president said he was in fact willing to see handling
 of elections and major issues of the country without his presence,
 but he decided after a series of discussions and debates to
participate in the elections slated for next February.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether he would accept the post of Majlis speaker,
Rafsanjani said it would depend on whether the winning candidates
would accept him.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts here said that because of his reputation and
power, Rafsanjani would win the support from both the conservative
and moderate factions to be the future Majlis speaker.
</P>
<P>
They believed that Rafsanjani's presence would encourage
moderates and reformists to strive to win the sensitive
parliamentary polling, which would create a new balance of power in
 the conservative-dominated Majlis.
</P>
<P>
Born in 1934 in Iran's central Kerman Province, Rafsanjani was a
 prominent political activist before the 1979 Islamic revolution,
Majlis speaker from 1980 to 1989, and president from July 1989 to
August 1997.
</P>
<P>
He announced to run for the parliament last week after Abdollah
Nouri, the reformist hopeful for the future Majlis speaker, was
sentenced to five years imprisonment by the conservative-controlled
 Special Cleric Court.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said that Nouri, former interior minister and
vice president for development and social affairs, has also
registered to run for the Majlis and the reformist-controlled
Interior Ministry said he is qualified as a candidacy since the
appeals court has not issued verdict on him.

<HEADLINE> Iran Denies Accepting Egypt's Conditions for Rapprochement </HEADLINE>

<P>
The Kuwaiti daily al-Watan reported on Tuesday that Khatami
accepted the conditions in a message sent to his Egyptian
counterpart Hosni Mubarrak through the Egyptian information
minister who attended the Conference of Islamic Information
Ministers held in Tehran earlier this month.
</P>
<P>
The daily said that Khatami called on the two countries to put
aside all their differences in order to resume their relations and
announced Tehran's readiness to take the step.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian official, who declined to be named, told
the Islamic Republic News Agency that the report by the Kuwaiti
daily Al-Watan is "totally baseless" and Khatami did not send any
message to Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
He said that Iran and Egypt are interested in improving their
relations and they are pacing the "natural course" of their ties.
</P>

Iran and Egypt severed their diplomatic relations after Tehran
accused Cairo of signing the Camp David peace accord with Israel,
the first one by an Arab country.
</P>
<P>
However, with the foreign policy of Iran's moderate President
Mohammad Khatami, Tehran and Cairo have improved bilateral
relations and cooperation, even though they have not resumed their
diplomatic relations.
</P>
<P>
Egyptian officials have called on Iran to remove the hurdle for
the resumption of ties by changing the name of a main street in
Tehran, which was named after Khaled Islamboli, the assassin of
former Egyptian President Anwar Sadat in 1981.

<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said last month that the
 development of Tehran-Cairo ties during the past two years were
satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the relations between the two countries

<HEADLINE> Sudanese President to Restructure Ruling NCP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
KHARTOUM, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Sudanese President Omar al-
Bashir Wednesday vowed to restructure the ruling National Congress
Party (NCP) with a view to striking balance among the executive,
legislative and political organs of the country.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with representatives of Sudan's trade unions
 and businessmen, al-Bashir reviewed the reasons for which he made
his decision to dissolve the parliament headed by powerful Hassan
al-Turabi, who is also secretary-general of the NCP.
</P>
<P>
But he said the national reconciliation process and dialog with
 all parties concerned would continue to establish peace and
stability in the war-torn African state.
</P>
<P>
The recent decisions were designed to put an end to the
contraditions among the state institutions and the duality of
decision, he said, adding that they are aimed at unifying the
political leadership and enhancing the state prestige.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abdul-Rahim Ali, chief of good-offices committee
mediating between the government and legislative, said the two
sides were willing to reconcile. He pointed out that there were
several initiatives to heal the rift.
</P>
<P>
The committee made remarkable progress towards reconciliation,
the Sudanese News Agency quoted Ali as saying.
</P>
<P>
"The common grounds between the two sides in the country are
larger than the disputed points," he noted, adding that the
differences were transitory and confined to the leadership.
</P>
<P>
However, al-Bashir said he would not backtrack from his
decisions.

<HEADLINE> New Report For Social Summit Review Finds Countries struggling to Meet         Social Needs in Globalizing World </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Most countries are
struggling to deal with issues of poverty, employment and social
integration in a globalizing world, yet they remain committed to
pursuing the social development objectives agreed on at the 1995
World Summit for Social Development, a new report by the United
Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs said on
Wednesday
</P>
<P>
The report found that one of the main objectives of the Summit -
- to promote heightened awareness and commitment to social issues
by governments and civil society -- has, in large measure,
occurred. The social ramifications of major economic developments,
such as the financial crises that shook East and South Asia,
Russia and Brazil, are now considered as priority issues, where
once they were viewed in purely economic or technical terms.
</P>
<P>
Prepared as a document for the Preparatory Committee for the
United Nations General Assembly special session that will review
progress made in the implementation of the outcome of the Social
Summit, the report is intended to sharpen the focus on the key
issues where new initiatives are needed. The General Assembly
special session will be held at the United Nations Office in
Geneva from 26-30 June 2000.
</P>
<P>
Although world leaders and government officials are
increasingly focusing on addressing the social concerns of their
citizens, the report also found little reason for complacency. The
absolute numbers of people living in poverty have continued to
grow since the Summit. Lcal and regional conflicts have prevented
real social integration in many countries. There has been a
decline in resources made available to the United Nations for
social development; and more people are vulnerable to financial
shocks than ever before.
</P>
<P>
The report found that governments were still committed to
achieving the goals agreed upon at the Social Summit. However,
their social and economic conditions varied widely from region to
region, each presenting unique situations and circumstances.
</P>
<P>
While social development in Africa was given special
consideration by the Social Summit, the report found that the
international community has largely left Africa in isolation. Weak
governments combined with an absence of the rule of law and a lack
of a vibrant private sector have deterred foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
The report identified eleven areas where the United Nations
special session should address implementation of the outcome of
the Social Summit, ranging from the rehabilitation of the public
sector, to meet the growing problem of inequality between and
within countries, to the needs of the working poor and the need to
create better and more jobs.
</P>
<P>
The report concluded that new initiatives that emerge from the
special session will have to embrace an integrated approach to
social development. "The challenge facing the General Assembly is
to develop the political will and practical tools necessary to put
those commitments into practice," said the report.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Welcomes Nazi Slave Labor Compensation Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that the compensation for the Nazi slave labor
victims under a deal reached by U.S. and German negotiators
satisfies the requirements of people representing the victims of
the Nazi slave and forced labor.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters at the White House, Clinton said that
German Chancellor Gerhard Shroeder wrote to him to confirm that
the German government and German industry are prepared to commit
10 billion German marks, or more than 5 billion U.S. dollars to
fund slave and forced laborers under the Nazi regime.
</P>
<P>
A deal was reached Tuesday on the compensation after months of
negotiations by representatives from the U.S. and Germany.
</P>
<P>
Germany has already made about 60 billion U.S. dollars in
payments for war crimes, but there has never been compensation for
the Nazi era's estimated 12 million enslaved and forced workers.
</P>
<P>
The forced laborers would be paid between 2,600 and 3,125 U.S.
dollars and slave laborers who were held in concentration camps
would receive about 7,800 U.S. dollars each.
</P>
<P>
"We close the 20th century with an extraordinary achievement
that will bring an added measure of material and moral justice to
the victims of this century's most terrible crime," Clinton told
reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton also lauded the German government. "This was not an
easy step for the German government to take," he said, adding that
"we could not have done this" without "truly remarkable leadership
" of Shroeder.

<HEADLINE> Negotiations on Iranian Supply of Gas to Turkey Under                Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Energy Minister Cumhur
Ersumer said Turkey is negotiating with Iran on the implementation
of a deal under which Iran had pledged to start natural gas exports
to Turkey in two weeks, a local daily newspaper reported on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Ersumer said Iran had delayed gas deliveries to Turkey under the
landmark 23-billion-U.S. dollars deal in 1996.
</P>
<P>
According to the deal, Turkey would initially buy 3 billion
cubic meters (bcms) of gas in 1999 from Iran through a pipeline
from Iran's Tabriz city to the Turkish capital Ankara.
</P>
<P>
A bit long ago, Iran promised to supply gas to the neighboring
country soon, but Ersumer expressed doubts on the timetable, saying
constructions of both the Turkish part of the pipeline and the
Iranian part are not ready yet.
</P>
<P>
Ersumer added that "we know Iran does not have the amount of gas
which it has pledged to us."
</P>
<P>
He said, however, that "negotiations are continuing, head of the
Turkish state pipeline company Botas will travel to Tehran next
week for further talks on the deal."
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the exports to Turkey will be another political
coup for Iran, which is looking to carry out such high-profile
deals to prove that the United States has failed to harm its
interests with the threat of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
For Turkey, the 1996 Turko-Iranian gas deal was heralded as
vital to its efforts to increase gas imports to meet demand which
is expected to rise to 15.8 bcms next year from 13 bcms this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been trying to diversify its energy sources to ensure
its energy deficit closed.

cuts.
</P>
<P>
ANKARA -- Turkish Privatization Administration (OIB) has

place bids in U.S. dollar terms, adding they would have to pay at
least 25 percent of their bids in cash, and the remaining 75
percent could be paid in equal installments over a maximum of three
years.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Strives to Improve Tourist Environment in Angkor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, December 16 (Xinhua) -- In an attempt to make the
temples of Angkor more attractive to tourists, Cambodian Apsara
Authority, a government tourism institution, took measures to ban
beggars and vendors from being around in the monuments there.
</P>
<P>
The government decided that no beggars shall be allowed on the
premises of Angkor Wat. It is a response to tourists' complaints
about being disturbed by the beggars.
</P>
<P>
Tourism is one of Cambodia's most promising industries and one
of the main foreign exchange earners.
</P>
<P>
The centuries-old Angkor Wat temples are regarded as some of
the world's most magnificent monuments and attract hundreds of
thousands of tourists every year.
</P>
<P>
The government's next step is to replace the pollutant
motorbikes and taxis with 300 battery-run electric cars that
officials hope will attract even more tourists.
</P>
<P>
In addition, airplanes will not allowed to fly over Angkor Wat
in order to protect the temples from damage by the strong sound
wave of the plane.
</P>
<P>
As the Tourism Minister Veng Seryvuth pointed out, Angkor Wat
is the heartland of the country, and a symbol of Cambodia's
tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> India Rejects Pakistan's Claim On Troops Withdrawal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- India Thursday termed as "an
exercise in obfuscation" Pakistan's claim that it had completed
the withdrawal of additional troops from the line of control (LOC)
in the disputed Kashmir.
</P>
<P>
"In actual fact, we have not observed any withdrawal of any
Pakistani troops deployed at the LOC," a spokesman of the External
Affairs Ministry told the media here today.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman recalled that Pakistani Chief Executive Pervaiz
Musharraf had on October 17 announced withdrawal of troops only
from the international border between the two countries and
Pakistani officials had thereafter clarified that there was to be
no withdrawal of troops from the LOC.
</P>
<P>
Recent remarks attributed to the Pakistan Army spokesman were
only an "exercise in obfuscation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the proposed reduction in defense expenditure as part of an
economic reforms package in Pakistan, the spokesman said New Delhi
had always desired economic stability and prosperity of the region
as a whole.

people, which he said the Chinese government and the people will
not forget.

areas of cooperation have ever been expanded, Zhu said. China
appreciates the efforts made by the Czech government, led by Prime
Minister Zeman, to promote Sino-Czech relations.

<P>
The Chinese people greatly value the traditional friendship
between China and Czech, and attaches importance to developing
bilateral relations, said Zhu, adding that China respects Czech
people's choice of their own social system and development path.
</P>
<P>
The Premier stressed that China is fully prepared to promote

<HEADLINE> Estrada Orders Release of Political Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In a press statement, Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said
these alleged political offenders (APOs) were convicted for crimes
committed in pursuit of their political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
"The move was made in the spirit of the Yuletide season and in
support of the government's continuing and unilateral efforts to
undertake confidence-building measures for the promotion of the
peace process," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said President Estrada ordered the release of the APOs on
Wednesday after the Department of Justice (DOJ) recommended the
grant of conditional pardon to the prisoners.
</P>
<P>
Estrada also approved the DOJ recommendation for the referral
of the cases of 40 more APOs to the Board of Pardons and Parole
because they were convicted for common crimes which were not
motivated by any political beliefs.
</P>
<P>
In signing the pardon papers of the APOs, Estrada stressed that
his administration will continue to pursue all efforts to push the
peace process forward, as well as to seek the release of
government personnel abducted by the New People's Army (NPA).
</P>
<P>
But the president also made it clear that police and military
units are more vigilant than ever to protect the public from
atrocities by armed rebels, like the NPA and the Moro Islamic
Liberation Front(MILF).
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government is now observing a suspension of
offensive military operations with the NPA. A cease-fire with the
MILF is also in effect pending the peace talks.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Projects Growth Rate of Four Percent for 1999-2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Shaukat Aziz Thursday projected over 4 percent growth rate during
the current fiscal in the backdrop of upbeat performance in the
agriculture and textile sector.
</P>
<P>
"The growth rate has been projected on the basis of emerging
economic situation," he told a press conference here while
explaining the features of the new economic agenda announced by
Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by other key economic officials, Aziz said in a
categorical term that the new government package was home-grown
and carved out without any pre-consultation with Bretton Woods
institutions.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf Wednesday announced an economic revival plan
which is targeted at establishing a self-reliant economy.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Abdul Razzaq Daud disclosed that country's
exports recorded 14 percent growth in November and the yearly
target of 9 billion U.S. dollars would likely to be surpassed.
</P>
<P>
Azuz said despite stable reserves position of the foreign
exchange, the pressure on balance of payment still persist as
trade deficit experienced 36 percent deterioration during the last
five months.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out possibility of seeking further debt
rescheduling depending upon "the country's cash flow conditions".
"We will continue to review and re-profile the debt position," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the several initiatives taken in this respect, he said, a
high-level special committee has been constituted to study and
keep strict vigil on the country's debt profile.
</P>
<P>
He made a mention about the rescheduling arrangements already
made with the Paris Club, London Club and through exchange of
eurobonds, which totaled over 2.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the present rescheduling is available for period of
one to two years, adding that "if required by the cash flow
position, further rescheduling could be considered."

MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- "The Chinese and Chinese hearts
are longing for return to the motherland." So reads an eye-
catching streamer on a 20-storey apartment building near the venue
for the upcoming Macao handover ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The streamer on the Jardim Hang Kei building is in fact one of
the huge streamers hung on Macao's high buildings or over the
streets, expressing Macao People's hope for "returning home".
Macao is to return to China on December 20 this year.
</P>
<P>
An old couple was choosing a TV set in a household electrical
appliances center on Almeida Avenue of downtown area. "Are you
going to take a daughter-in-law or marry away your daughter?" a
saleswoman asked the old couple.
</P>
<P>
"We don't want to miss any news programs about Macao's return (
to China)," the wife answered, explaining that they have an old TV
set they bought long time ago, and in case it does not work well
during the returning period, they have the new one.
</P>
<P>
U Yi Lam, 93, insisted that she go to the street to greet the
Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops to be stationed in
Macao despite she has to stand for a long time.
</P>
<P>
"Macao is returning home, and I have longed for the day all my
life," the nonagenarian said, adding that "the PLA troops are our
beloved people, and it's lucky for me to see them coming to Macao.
"
</P>
<P>
Macao people's patriotism has remained lofty despite centuries-
old separation from the motherland, for the peninsula has always
close contacts with the mainland in political, economic and
cultural fields.
</P>
<P>
In the Macao Hou Kong Middle School, for example, a five-star
national flag was hoisted on October 1st, 1949, to celebrate the
founding of the People's Republic of China. Ever since then, the
school has kept hoisting the Chinese national flag.
</P>
<P>
Governors of Macao were appointed by Portugal in the days of
Portuguese rule. Today, however, the Macao people have elected the
first Chief Executive of the Macao Special Administrative Region (
SAR).
</P>

"Macao's return inspires every public servant, and the
inspiration derives from a pride of being our own masters," said
Florida da Rosa Silva Chan, Secretary for Administration and

<HEADLINE> Tibet Autonomous Regional Committee of CPPCC Marks 40th Anniversary </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 100 members of the Tibet
Autonomous Regional Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) gathered here today to celebrate
the 40th anniversary of the regional commitee.
</P>
<P>
The members, from all walks of life in the region, recalled the
great changes that have taken place in Tibet since the democratic
reforms in 1959.
</P>
<P>
Ranba Yongjim, a member of the Tibet Autonomous Regional
Committee of the CPPCC and vice president of Tibetan Women's
Federation, said that economic reforms 40 years ago brought the
Tibetan people into the socialist system from serfdom, and they
have been owners of the country ever since.
</P>
<P>
She said women cadres now make up over 30 percent of the region
's total leadership, and are involved in both political and
economic management in the region.
</P>
<P>
More than 50 health and medical care centers for women and
children have been set up in over 30 counties in Tibet, and the
infant mortality had dropped to about 3.6 percent last year from
43 percent 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Qiang Xiaolin, an agricultural expert, said Tibet's agriculture
and animal husbandry have grown fast in the past 20 years, and are
providing enough food and clothing for 94 percent of the Tibetan
people.
</P>
<P>
Other members also spoke highly of the great achievements made
in China under the leadership of the Communist Party, and pledged
to continue working for national unity, the prosperity of Tibet,
and reunification of the motherland.

Another factor behind their hope is that they have seen with
their own eyes the successful implementation of the policies of "
one country, two systems", "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong"
and high-degree autonomy as well as the complete execution of the
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Macao people are fully confident of Macao's
return to China, said Prof. Ieong Wan Chong of University of Macao.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the Macao people also hope for social stability
and economic recovery. As is known to all, the Chinese mainland
has long been providing Macao with capital, personnel, raw
materials, and daily necessities, making it possible for Macao to
have achieved today's success.
</P>
<P>
As a matter of fact, the Macao people have also benefited from
the "effect of return". For example, police of both Macao and the
mainland have had good cooperation in cracking down cross-border
crimes and maintaining public order in Macao. And local residents
place high hopes on the PLA troops to be stationed in Macao in
this regard.
</P>
<P>
With the approaching of Macao's return, more and more mainland
tourists are coming to the region, and this will surely promote
the development of the local tourism industry, a key sector of the
Macao economy.

tightened their grip around the military complex at Elephant Pass.
</P>
<P>
Elephant Pass is a strategically important causeway linking the
mainland with Jaffna peninsula. Government troops maintain a major
base there as a first line of defense protecting Jaffna,the former
stronghold of LTTE that the government retook in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Major General Lionel Balagalle told a new conference on
Wednesday that government troops have repulsed LTTE's repeated
attempts to overrun Elephant Pass, inflicting heavy casualties
among the rebels.
</P>
<P>
He said LTTE rebels could still try to launch fresh attempts on
the Elephant Pass base.

<HEADLINE> Middle East Economic Briefs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are economic briefs
in brief from the Middle East countries.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's peace deals with Syria and the
Palestinians will probably cause housing demand to exceed supply
over the next decade, said a study conducted recently by the Bureau
of Assessors.
</P>
<P>
The study said that after the peace deals reached with Syria and
the Palestinians, most of the Israeli settlers have to leave the
Golan Heights and some to leave the West Bank to settle down in
other places in Israel.
</P>
<P>
The most suitable places that the settlers will choose, the
study said, will be Tel Aviv, Haifa and the Beer Sheva area in the
south.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Aqua International, an American investment fund,
has signed a deal to purchase 25 percent of Eden Springs, the
Israeli mineral water company located at the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
The timing of the deal is significant in light of the resumption
of negotiations between Israel and Syria on the future of the Golan
Heights this week in Washington.
</P>
<P>
Aqua International will pay between 55 million U.S. dollars to
60 million for its stake.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel signed on Wednesday a new temporary
agreement with Canada to regulate flights arrangements between the
two countries, thereby ending a dispute over flights by the two
countries' national carriers for the time being.
</P>
<P>
Under the deal, Air Canada and El Al can now each operate seven
weekly flights between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
TEHRAN -- Managing Director of the Iranian Fisheries
Organization Hamid Reza Shahmohammadi said here on Tuesday that the
sector has enjoyed a 100 percent growth during the second five-year
development plan (1995-2000).
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the plan, the canned fish food capacity was
about 120 million, but now it stood at 230 million while the number
of fish powder factories rose from 12 to 38 now, the Islamic
Republic News Agency quoted the official as saying.
</P>
<P>
The capacity of cold-storage units have increased from 23,000
tons to 78,000 tons in the said period, he said, and fish
production reached about 400,000 tons annually from 160,000 tons at
the beginning of the plan.
</P>
<P>
The official said that 27 fish processing factories and six
large fishing boats were also re-configured to meet the HCCP
European quality standards.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Optimism Returning to HK's Business Environment (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Two years after the Asian
economic crisis began, renewed, though cautious, optimism is
returning to Hong Kong's business environment, according to a
survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Findings show that 84 percent of AmCham member companies
responding to the survey foresee a "good" or "satisfactory"
outlook for the year 2000, compared with only 54 percent forecast
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The results suggest that the Hong Kong economy is recovering,
with greater recovery occurring within the next year. After a
painful two-year process of corporate downsizing and lower profits,
this is encouraging news for the American business community and
for Hong Kong," AmCham Chairman Jason Felton said at a press
conference, where the survey was published.
</P>
<P>
AmCham's 1999 Business Outlook Survey, conducted by ACNielsen,
was mailed to 1,036 corporate representatives and a total of 393
responses were received between October 4 and November 5,
representing a 38 percent response rate.

<HEADLINE> Survey: Optimism Returning to HK's Business Environment (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The survey results also suggest the business environment of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will improve
sharply in 2001 with respondents expecting this positive outlook
to be sustained through 2004.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, 53 percent of the member companies plan
to expand business in Hong Kong, as against 46 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Another finding this year is that of the 75 percent of
respondents that have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, 81
percent said they would retain their regional base here, while 15
percent were "unsure" of whether their headquarters would remain
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Given that the bulk of survey responses were collected during
the month of October -- just prior to the announcement of the
Disney deal, the landmark U.S.-China WTO Agreement, and other
confidence-building economic indicators -- I am confident that,
had our survey been conducted a few weeks later, much of this
uncertainty would have evaporated," AmCham President Frank Martin
said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Martin attributed the confidence of American companies in the
outlook for the business environment in Hong Kong and for the
future of Hong Kong to three major factors.
</P>
<P>
"The first is there is widely-held view that the worst of
regional economic crisis is now behind us and that the recovery we
are currently experiencing will continue into the future although
at times there maybe some setbacks in the individual countries in
the Asia-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Hong Kong SAR Government
last month, the gross domestic product of Hong Kong grew 4.5
percent in real terms in the third quarter of 1999 over a year
earlier.
</P>
<P>
Martin said the second factor was that American companies are
very pleased that the "One Country, Two Systems" principle is
working and they are confident that will continue to be the case
in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The third reason is that there is recognition that Hong Kong
has one of the best legal systems in the Asia-Pacific region. It
is an open, transparent, dependable system and the judicial area
is not subject to corruption as it is elsewhere in the region," he
said.

<TEXT>
<P>
Martin also said that many reports by the Western media
predicting doom for Hong Kong and the death of the legal systems
of Hong Kong after its return to China were wrong.
</P>
<P>
"From the business perspective, we believe that events have
subsequently proven that our view was correct that the transition
would go smoothly and would be without any real major incidents
that would cause confidence in the commercial sector to erode," he
said.
</P>
<P>
AmCham member companies continue to value and assess highly
Hong Kong's geographical location, communications network,
taxation system, free port status, and infrastructure, while the
quality of the environment, costs of doing business, and human
resources quality and costs are still Hong Kong's key weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
In terms of factors that affect their business decisions,
companies indicated that the maintenance of a strong legal and
regulatory system, and the availability of high quality personnel
were their top considerations.
</P>
<P>
Turning to China, Martin said that China's moves toward the
World Trade Organization accession in the wake of the summit
meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin during the Auckland Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in early September had "positively buoyed confidence levels
toward the China market."
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 97 percent, up from 91 percent in 1998,
of respondents believe the outlook for the business climate in the
mainland of China over the next five years will be favorable, with
a huge increase in the proportion of respondents predicting a "
very favorable" outlook, up from 19 percent in 1998 to 61 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of respondents currently have operations
in China and the survey results suggest that this trend is likely
to continue.

<HEADLINE> Sixers Win First Game after Iverson Comeback </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Philadelphia 76ers won
their first game after top shooter Allen Iverson's comeback from
injury as they disposed off the Toronto Raptors 93-91 on Thursday
in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
It was the second game for Iverson, who was held to 11 points
in a loss to Charlotte on his first game back, after he missed 10
games for a broken thumb and "The Answer" drilled in 37 points to
lead the Sixers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
He hit just 13-34 from the field, but poured in three 3-
pointers and contributed seven rebounds and seven assists.
</P>
<P>
Vince Carter, who led the Raptors with 19 points, missed a
winning chance in the dying seconds when his jumper from the left
corner bounced off the front of the rim.
</P>
<P>
Tracy McGrady added 18 points and Antonio Davis grabbed 18
rebounds for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
In San Antonio, David Robinson was the go-to guy as he scored
the last six points in a decisive 12-0 burst as the Spurs rallied
for an 83-77 victory over the Houston Rockets.
</P>
<P>
Tim Duncan led San Antonio with 20 points and 10 rebounds,
while Robinson finished with 14 points. Steve Francis scored 24

<HEADLINE> Macao to Continue Boosting Education Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The education sector of Macao
will enter a new stage as the relevant laws promulgated in recent
years will be implemented and improved after the territory returns
to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Sou Chio Fai, sub-director of the Education and Youth Services,
made the remarks here today at a news briefing. His department is
responsible for making and implementing long-term education plans
and its framework will basically remain unchanged after the
handover.
</P>
<P>
Education sector has developed rapidly over the past decade and
will be attached with greater importance in future, Sou said,
noting that the government's goal is to enable children, aged 5-15,
to enjoy the right of compulsory education.
</P>
<P>
According to law here, children in Macao are granted a 10-year
long compulsory schooling period covering pre-school, primary
school and junior middle school education.
</P>
<P>
In the history, Macao has been a key place for cultural
exchanges between the East and the West and Asia's first western-
style college was founded here. However, Macao had not
standardized its education system with law until 1991. For the
past nine years, he said, the Macao Government has issued over 60
laws and regulations on education.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Macao has 113 schools, with public-funded ones only
accounting for 15 percent and 85 percent owned by individuals.
Eighty-three percent of the private schools have also joined the
public education system to provide compulsory education to
children.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the government published a law to specify the
qualifications of teachers. Up to now, there are 3,801 teachers in
Macao, mostly working in primary and middle schools.
</P>
<P>
"In recent years, Macao has set up more schools to meet the
needs of the growing population," Sou said. Since 1993, over 30
new educational institutions have been added in the territory,
making up 20 percent of the total and providing schooling for more
than 20,000 students.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey shows that Macao ranks fifth among 40 Asian
cities in terms of investment in education. In recent years, the
government input in the sector has averaged one billion Patacas
annually.
</P>
<P>
To meet the needs of post-handover Macao, the government has
been revising the curricula with help of experts from Beijing,
Hong Kong and the region.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, beginning last year, the majority of
local schools have adopted Chinese and Portuguese as their
teaching languages, while in public primary schools, students have
begun to learn Putonghua, or Chinese Mandarin, from the fourth
year. Now 90 percent of private schools have also opened classes
on Putonghua.

<HEADLINE> G-20 Finance Ministers Meet in Berlin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Finance ministers and central
bank governors of the world's 20 most important countries held an
informal meeting here Thursday aimed at preventing international
financial crises.
</P>
<P>
At the first meeting of the G-20 finance ministers, they
discussed national policy and the international community's role
in preventing financial crises, the German Finance Ministry who
hosted the meeting said in a press release.
</P>
<P>
The 20 countries, including the seven industrialized nations (G-
7), Russia, Australia, Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia,
Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea and Turkey,
account for 85 percent of the world's products and two thirds of
the population.
</P>
<P>
Initiated by the G-7 finance ministers at the Cologne summit in
June, the G-20 was set up as a forum for countries to hold "
informal dialogues over international economic and monetary
policies, which are meaningful to the stability of the
international financial and monetary system," said the press
release.
</P>
<P>
German Finance Minister Hans Eichel said Wednesday that the
world should learn from the Asian financial crisis in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"While great benefits in terms of growth and prosperity may
generally be derived from globalization and world economic
integration, these processes present major challenges to us as
policy makers; the crisis situations in 1997 and 1998 made that
painfully clear," said Eichel.
</P>
<P>
"Fortunately the countries that were the hardest hit now appear
to have recovered much more rapidly than we were able to hope even
some months ago. Yet we cannot permit ourselves to feel secure,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Eichel urged everyone to make every effort "at national and
international levels" to prevent new crises from happening, saying
that "we must now take resolute action to adopt concrete measures"
to reform the international financial structure.

more than 1,700 companies in their global expansion in 1999,
compared with 1,356 firms in 1998, and its promotion efforts to
strengthen Singapore's external trade wing has resulted in more
companies venturing overseas and returning to Asia to take
advantage of the business opportunities for trade and investment
arising from the improved economic conditions.

with bilateral trade volume at 56.8, 43.8 and 13.1 billion
Singapore dollars (one U.S. dollar equals 1.68 Singapore dollars),
respectively in the first 10 months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
They said TDB plans to open a third Overseas Trade Office in
San Francisco, U.S., in view of Singapore companies' growing
presence in the U.S. and to help serve their needs better so as to
keep them closer to where the latest in cutting edge technology is
being developed and where new ideas are floated.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Leads The Way in Air Pollution Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Beijing, the Chinese national
capital, is close to reach its air pollution control target for
this year, said vice-mayor Wang Guangtao today.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of this year, Beijing has cut
emissions of sulfur dioxide by 27 percent.
</P>
<P>
Two million tons of coal with less sulfur content have been
burned and several hundred million cubic meters of natural gas
have been used in the city, which is striving to make itself
cleaner and fresher.
</P>
<P>
At least 60,000 unworthy vehicles will be taken off the roads
and emission control devices will be installed in 110,000 cars.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, the total emission of
nitrogen oxide which is found in auto gas emissions has dropped by
five percent from the same period last year, while carbon monoxide
levels has dropped 10 percent. The level of suspended particles in
the air have been maintained due to large green belts around the
city.
</P>
<P>
Wang said it remains an arduous task to further improve the
quality of air in Beijing as the city still burns 25 million tons
of coal each year. Only 150,000 of the city's 1.4 million motor
vehicles are up to stringent environmental protection standards.
</P>
<P>
Wang vowed to continue the four-year pollution control
campaign Beijing launched a year ago by encouraging cleaner energy
alternatives and environment-friendly products.

<HEADLINE> Retail Sales in Britain Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Retail sales in Britain picked
up in November, when shoppers spent 0.2 percent more than in
October, leaving them 4.1 percent up from last year.
</P>
<P>
The increase was slightly less than analysts expected. The
Office for National Statistics (ONS) said Thursday the strong
retail sales trend has changed little from previous months.
</P>
<P>
The main forces driving the current increase were household
goods and "other stores" categories, the ONS added.
</P>
<P>
While the volume of goods sold continued to grow, the cash
earnings of shopkeepers failed to keep pace indicating that the
increase in retail sales is partly due to falling prices.
</P>
<P>
However, economists believe the strong retail sales figure is
another sign that the UK economy has recovered from the slowdown
that affected it earlier this year.

million dollars in fiscal 2000.

and environment has doubled compared with 1999, and that for
education has climbed by 47 percent, while budget for public heath
has increased by 51 percent.
</P>
<P>
Spending on defense and security has been reduced from 3.8

the allocation next year will mainly be used for soldiers' pay and
clothes and food, he said. "We hope there will be a true reduction
in military in next year,"the prince added.
</P>
<P>
Ranariddh also said that the allocation for public investments,
such as road construction, are still less than expectations, while
the dependence on foreign aid is too much.

<P>
MOSCOW, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Russia Thursday rejected a
statement by NATO foreign ministers regarding Moscow's military
campaign against rebels in Chechnya as pointless, unacceptable and
amoral.
</P>
<P>
The statement, made Wednesday by the foreign ministers of the
alliance, was "pointless as far as the content goes, unacceptable
as far as the essence goes, and amoral as far as their authorship
goes," the Russian Foreign Ministry said.
</P>
<P>
"The latest outpouring of crocodile tears in Brussels over
human rights (in Chechnya) is stunning in its wanton cynicism,"
the Interfax news agency quoted a Foreign Ministry report as
saying.
</P>
<P>
It said that by condemning Russia's operation in Chechnya, the
NATO generals, such as Supreme Commander Wesley Clark, attempted
to make the world forget the NATO air strikes against the
international TV centers and foreign embassies in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
"The Russian Federation's internal affairs are not, cannot be,
and will not be the subject of international dialogue, especially
with NATO," the report said.
</P>
<P>
It said Russia doubted the remark about restoring constructive
relations with Russia in the NATO statement.

<HEADLINE> Russia Continues Campaign Against Chechen Rebels </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Air Force flew over 50 sorties in the morning alone to
destroy enemy defense positions, bases and camps in southern
Chechnya, the Interfax news agency reported, quoting an official
in the Russian military command in the North Caucasus.
</P>
<P>
The Su-25 attack planes, Su-24 light bombers and Mi-24 army
helicopter gunships will continue their attacks during the day and
into the night, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In Moscow, First Deputy Chief of the Russian General Staff
Valery Manilov said federal forces are expected to capture Grozny,
the Chechen capital, within the next few days.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that the main part of the operation is expected to
be completed before the end of the year, although "small rebel
formations will survive and we shall need a couple of months to
finish the operation."
</P>
<P>
Manilov reiterated that the federal command does not plan to
storm Grozny and is working on a plan to ensure a safe evacuation
of civilians from the city.
</P>
<P>
"We shall definitely allow civilians to leave Grozny and will
possibility set up five or six safe corridors," he said.
</P>
<P>
Manilov said about 7,000 rebels have been killed since the
beginning of the anti-terrorist operation in the North Caucasus,
including about 5,000 killed in Chechnya. The federal forces have
lost 402 soldiers, including about 130 in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
Moscow launched the military campaign following armed
incursions by Chechen rebels in neighboring Daghestan and a spate
of terrorist bombings, also blamed on the Chechen militants, that
killed over 300 people in Moscow and two other Russian cities.
</P>
<P>
Manilov dismissed as senseless talks with Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
"As long as he (Maskhadov) does not dissociate himself from
terrorists to help the Russian authorities put an end to this evil,
he cannot be a party to the negotiating process," he told a
seminar on Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
Otherwise, the entire negotiating process will be senseless,
but would likely help terrorists and militants "to regroup for
their inhuman operations," he said.

Some vice-chancellors and other high-ranking officials of the
universities are also to go in the days to come, the Guardian
newspaper reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A reconstitution of the National Universities Commission was
also approved by the Federal Executive Council at its weekly
meeting in the Nigerian capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo, who is currently on a
four-day state visit to Germany, was represented by Vice-President
Atiku Abubakar at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister Dapo Sarumi said after the meeting that
the measures followed recommendations raised by visitation panels
to probe activities of the universities.
</P>
<P>
Over two decades of relative obsolescence, obscurity and
general frustration in the universities are a sad fact in the
country, Sarumi said.
</P>
<P>
That was why 24 visitation panels to the universities were
formed, he added.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 24 federally owned universities in
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urged to Help Nigeria Get Back Looted Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Vice-President Atiku
Abubakar has urged the U.S. government to go the extra mile and
utilize its international influence to persuade European countries
to co-operate in getting back its looted money.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar made the call when meeting an eight-man U.S.
delegation by Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs Thomas
Pickering in Abuja Tuesday, the Guardian newspaper reported
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president told the U.S. officials that the Swiss
government has pledged to assist in the repatriation of 600
million U.S. dollars out of an estimated 2.5 billion dollars
stashed in that country's banks by Nigeria's former public
officials.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar also called on the U.S. to support and facilitate
Nigeria's move for debt forgiveness in view of the severe debt
over-hang which had been stalling infrastructure development in
the most populous African country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he also canvassed more areas of cooperation and
assistance from the U.S. by way of huge investment, technical aid,
military training and facilities to be able to enhance the
on-going restructuring of the Nigerian military.
</P>
<P>
Pickering, in response, commended Nigeria's democratization
efforts by saying that the steps taken so far were cheering and
welcome.
</P>
<P>
Pledging U.S. commitment to working closely with Nigeria to
enhance its economic recovery, the U.S. official said his
government is increasingly focusing on Nigeria and "we would even
triple and quadruple our level of assistance to Nigeria in areas
of investment and technical assistance."
</P>
<P>
However, Pickering noted that there is need for the government
to take more practical steps to eliminate corruption in the
country.

<TEXT>
<P>
Addressing the second plenary session of the 13th Executive
Council of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU),Hu
said that workers should play a bigger role in and make greater
contribution to structural adjustment, transformation of
enterprises' mechanism, management improvement, and market
expansion.
</P>
<P>
He also asked trade unions to work harder to protect and
develop the rights and interests of its workers.
</P>
<P>
Trade unions should actively support Party committees and
governments at all levels in their bid to resolve workers'
complaints and deal harshly with cases in which their rights and
interests are violated, he said.
</P>
<P>
Relying whole-heartedly on the working class is necessary to
strengthen Party leadership and the socialist system as well as an
important prerequisite for good and sound management of China's
industry, Hu stressed.
</P>
<P>
He said that trade unions should be provide support and
guidance for workers and make greater efforts to strengthen trade
unions at the grassroots.
</P>
<P>
Hu called on the trade unions to carry out sound ideological
work, emphasizing the need to further educate its workers on
patriotism, collectivism and socialism.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Economy Out of "Intensive Care Unit" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The notorious traffic
nightmare is back, said Bangkokians. To make matters worse, they
said, more and more cars with red plates, which indicate that they
are bought within one month, appeared on the already crowded
streets in the Thai capital.
</P>
<P>
Indeed, red-plate cars have become the clearest sign of a hard-
fought economic recovery in the third year after the financial
storm hit the Southeast Asian "tiger" in July 1997.
</P>
<P>
With almost all of its foreign reserves depleted by the storm,
Thailand had to accept a 17.2 billion U.S. dollar rescue package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shortly after
the crisis broke out.
</P>
<P>
After two and a half years' fight, Thailand managed to bring
the international reserves to the present level of 32 billion
dollars, a level high enough to back the government's decision in
September to suspend drawing the remaining three billion dollars
from the IMF rescue funds.
</P>
<P>
At the height of the crisis, the Thai currency, the baht, fell
sharply from 26 baht to the dollar to as low as 55-56 baht.
</P>
<P>
But now, the baht has been stabilized at around 38 baht to the
greenback, with movement in quite a narrow range.
</P>
<P>
During the same period, the country's external debts have been
reduced from 96 billion dollars to 80 billion, with debts of the
private sector being lowered from 70 billion dollars to 44 billion.
</P>
<P>
Despite steep drop of the baht's value, the Thais managed to
keep inflation under control since mid-1998. The inflation rate
now stands at about 0.5 percent, enabling interest rates to fall.
</P>
<P>
The financial crisis brought down the Thai economy to a 10
percent contraction in the gross domestic products (GDP) in 1998,
but the economy successfully achieved a positive GDP growth of 0.9
percent and 3.5 percent, respectively, in the first and second
quarters of 1999.
</P>
<P>
Both Thai government officials and IMF representatives expected
a three to four percent GDP growth for the whole year of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The three economic stimulus packages launched by the government
in the past two years have been hailed as effective in helping
elevate the country's economic performance.
</P>
<P>
On August 14, 1998, the government introduced a comprehensive
financial reform package, helping local commercial banks to
recapitalize.
</P>
<P>
On March 30, 1999, the government implemented a 130-billion-
baht(3.5-billion-dollar) stimulus package, which was featured by
cuts of value-added tax and personal income tax and an increase of
budget deficit from five percent of the total GDP to six percent.
</P>
<P>
Nearly five months later, another package worth more than 100
billion baht (2.59 billion dollars) was introduced to spur the
exports and domestic demands by cutting import tariffs on some raw
materials and issuing bonds for potential home-buyers.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to all these packages, most of the "engines" of the Thai
economy, namely public spending, exports, domestic demands and
private investment, have resumed operation.

<HEADLINE> 15 Lebanese Children Wounded in South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen Lebanese children, all
under 10, were seriously wounded Thursday in a pro-Israel militia's
shelling on a south Lebanon school, security sources said.
</P>
<P>
The children were wounded when one of the mortar rounds fired by
the South Lebanon Army (SLA) hit their school in Arab Salim
village, which faces the Israeli-occupied border zone in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel has confirmed that the shelling was launched by its ally
SLA, saying it aimed at retaliating earlier attacks from the same
village by guerrillas of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of
God.
</P>
<P>
But Hezbollah denied that its fighters had launched any
operations on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss issued a
statement strongly condemning the shelling.
</P>
<P>
"This is the latest Israeli aggression on Lebanon which was
added to the Jewish state's black record of attacks against
Lebanese civilians," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said Lebanon will file a complaint with the international
fire-ceasing committee which was set up in April 1996 after an
Israeli assault on Lebanon killing more than 200 people.
</P>
<P>
The five-nation group, made up of officers from the United
States, France, Syria, Lebanon and Israel, has been charged with
supervising the adherence of south Lebanon's belligerents to the
preclusion of civilian targets from warring parties.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, two Lebanese civilians were wounded in the
heaviest clash in recent months between Israeli forces and Lebanese
guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The escalation of hostilities in south Lebanon came as Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa is in Washington along with
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak for landmark negotiations aimed
at ending a half-century of conflicts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian Hezbollah's Secretary General Hassan Nasrallah
has said that despite the resumption of the Syrian-Israeli talks,
his group will not stop operations against Israeli occupation
forces until Israel pulls out of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-declared security zone in south Lebanon in
1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from Lebanese
guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by
Hezbollah has been fighting to oust Israelis out of the country.

OTTAWA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Alaska skiers Wendy Wagner and

night in the Continental Cup cross-country ski series in Canmore,

<P>
...and private investment, have resumed operation.
</P>
<P>
For public spending, the government, in the March 30 stimulus
package, allowed its budget deficit in the 1999 fiscal year to run
at six percent of the total GDP instead of the previous five
percent, offering more room for the expansion of public spending.
</P>
<P>
For exports, the country has seen a recovered growth after
years' recession beginning even before the financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, Thailand exported goods
worth 52.87 billion dollars, or a 6.1 percent increase from the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Ministry officials expected that exports for the whole
year will grow by six percent from last year's 54.3 billion
dollars, exceeding the originally targeted four percent growth.
</P>
<P>
Domestic demands were also effectively prompted, which was best
demonstrated by the surge of automobile sales.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months of this year, some 181,134 cars were
sold, a 43.6 percent growth from the same period of last year. In
November alone, automobile sales reached 21,266 units, a record
high in 26 months.
</P>
<P>
Total automobile sales for the year are expected to exceed 200,
000, said Toyota Motor Thailand Ltd, which conducts the statistics
of the Thai automobile industry for the government.
</P>
<P>
The only engine that is not functioning so well is private
investment, which was curbed by a high level of non-performing
loans (NPLs) in local commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
At the end of October, NPLs stood at 2.35 trillion baht (61
billion dollars), accounting for 43.39 percent of the total
outstanding loans of the entire Thai banking system.
</P>
<P>
Lamed by the NPLs, local banks are reluctant to extend new
loans, fearing that they will soon turn bad again.
</P>
<P>
This policy has made local enterprises, especially small- and
medium-sized ones, suffer since they depended heavily on bank
loans for their operation.
</P>
<P>
The government is trying hard to lower the NPL level by
accelerating the progress of debt restructuring and encouraging
local institutions to set up asset management companies to
separate bad loans from good ones.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry expected that NPLs will drop to 40 percent
by the end of this year and decrease further next year.
</P>
<P>
With the alleviation of the NPL trauma, the government hoped
that the Thai economy would grow by at least four percent next
year.
</P>
<P>
Some economists refuse to share the optimism of the government
on the rosy picture of the economy, saying great challenges are
still ahead.
</P>
<P>
They argue that the country's exports are likely to be
undermined by the expected fall of agricultural products next year
and there is little room for the government to expand state
spending since the public debts will reach a peak at 60 percent of
GDP next year.
</P>
<P>
Despite the differences, one opinion commonly agreed is that
the ailing Thai economy has been unmistakably out of the "
intensive-care unit."
</P>
<P>
Both the optimists and the pessimists agreed that apart from
short-term measures to steer the economy, long-term structural
adjustment is also urgently needed as the recovery is still
fragile.
</P>
<P>
They said reforms in Thailand's legal system, government
agencies and state enterprises are necessary in order to guarantee
the country a higher degree of competitiveness in the "post-crisis
" era.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The 11th session of final-
status negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, scheduled
for Thursday morning, were postponed till Sunday morning, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian negotiation team asked for the delay because its
chief negotiator Yasser Abed Rabbo is sick, according to the
report. There are no details about Rabbo's sickness.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts claimed that the Palestinians put off the
talks in order to observe and evaluate the latest progress of the
Israeli-Syrian track.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the resumption of Israeli-Syrian
talks Wednesday in Washington worried the Palestinians because they
are afraid that any progress of the Syrian track would divert
attention from the Israeli-Palestinian talks and make the them more
difficult.
</P>
<P>
The final-status talks' last session was held Monday at the Erez
checkpoint after last week's incident, in which the Palestinians
threatened to suspend the talks to protest against Jewish
settlement activities in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
With the mediation of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, the Palestinians at last decided to resume the talks, but
to keep the settlement issue on top of the agenda.

<HEADLINE> HK's Economy Turns Around </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's economic
prospects now look excellent, said a senior Hong Kong financial
official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mike Rowse, director of the business and services promotion
unit of the financial secretary's Office, made the conment on the
results of the 1999 Business Outlook Survey conducted by the
American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's economic prospects now look excellent. As we have
said all along, our sound fundamentals will show through in time.
Clearly the Amcham members share our view that the worst is over,"
Rowse said.
</P>
<P>
He said this was further evidence that the economy had turned
around.
</P>
<P>
He was encouraged by the fact that an overwhelming majority of
the survey respondents (as many as 84 percent of the 393 AmCham
members companies that responded) perceived a "good" or "
satisfactory" outlook in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the positive outlook for our economy is also widely
shared by the international community," Rowse said.
</P>
<P>
The continuous confidence in Hong Kong's business environment
is evidenced by the fact that 81 percent of the 75 percent of
companies that have regional headquarters in Hong Kong said they
would retain their regional base and one third of them said they
intended to expand their operations.
</P>
<P>
In assessing the business environment in Hong Kong, respondents
said that the five most satisfactory aspects of doing business in
Hong Kong are: geographical location, taxation system, free port
status, communication network and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will continue to provide a positive environment for
people to do business," Rowse said.

<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong SAR Police
Force is fully prepared to mobilize sufficient manpower for
policing duties during celebrations to mark the new millennium,
Assistant Commissioner of Police, Cheung Chi-shum, said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Ninety-five percent of the strength of the operational
formations is being maintained, and this arrangement is expected

</P>
<P>
"Police presence will be maximized on the streets so that the

</P>
<P>
As most of the celebration activities would be held on the Y2K
critical moments, Cheung said Police would maintain close liaison
with other government departments and policy bureaus to ensure
that the community as a whole would not be affected by any Y2K-
induced or other unforeseen incidents.
</P>
<P>
"About 14,000 Police officers, including Auxiliary Police

on New Year's Eve," he said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that all the computer systems of the Force were Y2K

</P>
<P>
On Y2K sensitive dates, task forces and enhanced manning of
Police control centers will be effected round the clock.
</P>
<P>
As part of the millennium celebration period will coincide with
the Christmas and New Year holidays as well as the run-up to the
Lunar New Year, Police will also take preventive measures against
crimes common in the festive season.
</P>
<P>
"Everything will be under control to ensure a smooth transition
to the new millennium," Cheung said.

<HEADLINE> Official: 320,000 Chinese Abroad for Further Education Since 1978 ( 1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 110,000 out of the
320,000 Chinese students who went abroad for further studies
since China's opening-up in 1978 have returned to China after
graduation, and made great contributions to the country's economic
and social developments.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Baoqing, vice-minister of education, announced the
figures here this morning in his address to the ongoing 11th
plenary session of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee of the
National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the Chinese students who studied abroad
have reduced the gap between China and the developed nations in
areas of academic and scientific research. Some of the returned
students have used the advanced technologies they have learned
abroad to boost the domestic economy.
</P>
<P>
From 1978 to 1998, more than 320,000 Chinese went to 103
countries for further studies, 50,000 of whom were sent by the
state, 100,000 by the government units they work in, and 170,000
at their own expense.
</P>
<P>
"China's eye-catching achievements over the past 20 years and
its promising future are encouraging an increasing number of
Chinese students to return home," said the vice minister.

and 7,400 respectively, signaling a yearly increase of 13 percent.
</P>
<P>
in addition, more and more returned students are setting up
their own businesses. Shanghai, China's economic center, boasts
over 750 such entities, and one of them even pushed its annual
turnover to more than 600 million RMB yuan.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said that the government will stick to its basic
principles for overseas study: supporting the Chinese people to
study abroad; encouraging them to return to China after graduation;
and ensuring their freedom to come and go.
</P>
<P>
He urged departments concerned to find ways to lure more
students returning home, so as to promote the development of China
's high-tech industries and enhance the competitive edge of China

<P>
The 102 photos on the exhibition unfolded the history and
development of Macao, which is an inalienable part of China but
had fallen bit by bit under Portugal's occupation since the mid-
16th century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and Portuguese governments signed a joint
declaration on the Macao issue on April 13, 1987 and agreed on
China's resuming exercise of sovereignty over Macao on December 20,
1999.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on opening ceremony of the photo show, Nepalese
Minister for Youth, Sports and Culture Sharad Singh Bhandari
conveyed the message of congratulation by Prime Minister Krishna
Prasad Bhattarai on Macao's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Bhandari said the return of Macao to China is good for Macao
people, because their right will be secured under China's "One
Country, Two System" policy.
</P>
<P>
The Macao people will be able to decide the fate by themselves,
Bhandari said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the opening function, Chinese Ambassador Zeng Xuyong
made a brief introduction of Macao and expressed the conviction
that the successful return of Macao will be an important step for

<HEADLINE> HK to Enhance Economic Relations with Macao: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
Thursday said that Hong Kong will further enhance the economic
cooperation with Macao after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the future cooperation between Hong Kong and Macao is
promising. The cooperative projects will be planned in tourism
industry and joint efforts will be made to develop the area of
Pearl River Delta with Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Tung said that
the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" has been well-
implemented in Hong Kong in all aspects of life over the past two
and a half years, adding that he believes that it will also be
well-implemented in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he is optimistic about the future of Macao and the
success of the reunification of the motherland since what Hong
Kong has done over the past years proved that the concept of "One
Country, Two Systems" is correct and powerful.
</P>
<P>
"China's resumption of sovereignty over Macao is the pride of
the nation and it is very precious opportunity to witness another
celebration of historical significance," Tung said. He will attend
the ceremony to be held in Macao on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's experience must be helpful to the newly-born Macao'
s SAR government, Tung said, adding that "on one hand, we must
spare no effort to maintain the two systems, and on the other we
must be active in helping the Hong Kong people know more about the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the Hong Kong SAR government has played an
important role in the construction of Hong Kong's economy,
especially in infrastructure, including the construction of
airport, roads and tourism facilities, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The government should help create favorable environment for
local people to display their talents and capacity," he said. "In
addition to the hardware, we have helped create favorable software
environment, including investment in education and living
environment."

<HEADLINE> UNFICYP Mandate Extended for Another Six Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Security Council
passed late Wednesday night a resolution extending the U.N.
Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP) mandate for another six
months, the Cyprus News Agency reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution reaffirmed all previous U.N. resolutions on
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
U.S. resolutions called for a Cyprus settlement based on a state
 of Cyprus with a single sovereignty and international personality
and a single citizenship, comprising two politically equal
communities in a bi-communal and bi-zonal federation.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council noted in its UNFICYP resolution that the
Cyprus government "has agreed that in view of the prevailing
conditions in the island it is necessary to keep the UNFICYP in
Cyprus beyond December 15, 1999."
</P>
<P>
The UNFICYP mandate is extended for a further six-month period
ending June 15, 2000 and U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan is
requested "to submit a report by June 1, 2000 on the implementation
 of this resolution."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Turkish Cypriots-controlled
north and the Greek Cypriots-dominated south since 1974 when the
Turkish troops invaded and occupied the northern third of the
island following a short-lived coup, engineered by the then Greek
Junta against late President Archbishop Makarios.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the UNFICYP troops have been patrolling along the
dividing line separating the Turkish troops and the Greek Cypriot
National Guards.

<HEADLINE> China In Sprint At Finish To Clear Up Major Lake </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China has been sprinting to
finish the clean-up of one of its major lakes, Chaohu in Anhui
Province, as all industrial enterprises around the freshwater lake
must meet state pollutant discharge standards by the end of 1999
as scheduled to meet the requirements by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
This was announced recently by Huang Yuezhong, vice-governor of
the province.
</P>
<P>
Clearing up Chaohu Lake, one of China's five largest freshwater
lakes, is one of the nation's largest environmental protection
projects.
</P>
<P>
Chaohu Lake has been threatened by serious pollution and
dwindling wetlands for the past several years because of rapid
industrial development and advancing urbanization around the lake.
</P>
<P>
An estimated 280 million tons of industrial sewage and that
created by nearby residents flows into the lake every year, and
the region around the lake, 13,000 square kilometers, suffers from
serious soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
Work to control pollution on the lake is progressing smoothly,
and of the leading 109 enterprises around it, each producing more
than 100 tons of waste water per day, 85 have reached state
emission standards and 14 have been shut down, moved or changed to
other production. The remaining 10 are working hard to reach the
goal as scheduled. All these endeavors have so far cost 227
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
In addition, of the 162 enterprises that each produce fewer
than 100 tons of waste water, 120 have completed pollutant
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Anhui has used 140 million US dollars of loans from the Asian
Development Bank, and six million US dollars of loans from foreign
governments to build sewage disposal plants and facilities in
cities located in the lake region.
</P>
<P>
A project to clean out silt deposited in the lake bed, which
fills with more than two million tons of silt and mud annually

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Meets Brazilian Vice-President (More Added) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Jiang extended a warm welcome to Maciel, who will also attend
the handover ceremony of Macao following the visit. The president
noted that during the 25 years since the initiation of diplomatic
relations, especially since 1993 when the two countries
established strategic partnership, bilateral cooperation in
various fields have witnessed considerable development.
</P>
<P>
China appreciates Brazil's pursuit of the "one China" policy
and is grateful for its support to China's accession to the WTO,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The president also recalled his visit to Brazil in 1993, and
said Brazil left a deep impression on him for its rich natural
resources, strong national power, and hospitable people.
</P>
<P>
Maciel also recalled Jiang's visit, and said that since then,
bilateral relations, especially cooperation in the area of
politics, have been increased.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the Brazilian government appreciates the "one China,
two systems" policy of China, reaffirming Brazil's adherence to
the "one China" stance. The vice-president noted his attendance at
the handover ceremony of Macao fully shows the position of the
Brazilian government on this issue.
</P>
<P>
Maciel said Brazil and China share similar positions on world
affairs, and as the largest developing country in the western and
eastern hemispheres, respectively, Brazil and China should further
expand cooperation and promote the multi-polarization of the world.
</P>
<P>
Jiang voiced his appreciation for this. He pointed out the
world is a colorful one, and no country can impose its own ideas
on the others. The rhetoric that "human rights weighs heavier than
sovereignty" is merely a demonstration of power politics, he said.
</P>
<P>
Maciel arrived in Beijing Wednesday for an official visit at
the invitation of Chinese Vice-President Hu Jintao.

<HEADLINE> New Talks to Examine Cyprus Parties' Positions: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus Foreign Minister Ioannis
 Kasoulides has said the second round of the U.N.-sponsored
proximity talks on Cyprus is to examine in depth the positions of
the two Cypriot communities.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus News Agency (CNA) reported Thursday that Kasoulides
said the talks, scheduled to take place in Geneva from January 27
until February 6, 2000, will try to ascertain common ground on
various points, already discussed in the first round.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that he was encouraged by the fact that the
talks to be continued in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader
Rauf Denktash started proximity talks in New York on December 3-14,
 under the U.N. auspices, to find a solution for the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriots
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island in reaction to a failed coup in
Nicosia seeking union with Athens.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides predicted that there would be no deadlock in the next
 round as no agreement is anticipated to be concluded in Geneva, an
 objective expected to be achieved at a later phase of
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister noted that many issues relating to Cyprus
and Turkey have now been placed under the scrutiny of the European
Union (EU), as both countries are now candidates for accession.
</P>
<P>
He called on the Turkish Cypriot leader to swim with the flow. "
Today's circumstances and conjunctures, relating to the Helsinki
summit and Greco-Turkish relations, are such that enable us to make
 every possible effort to seek a settlement in Cyprus," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) - Hong Kong's economic
prospects now look excellentl, said a senior Hong Kong financial
official Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Mike Rowse, director of the business and services promotion
unit of the financial secretary's Office, made the conment on the
results of the 1999 Business Outlook Survey conducted by the
American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's economic prospects now look excellent. As we have
said all along, our sound fundamentals will show through in time.
Clearly the Amcham members share our view that the worst is over,"
Rowse said.
</P>
<P>
He said this was further evidence that the economy had turned
around.
</P>
<P>
He was encouraged by the fact that an overwhelming majority of
the survey respondents (as many as 84 per cent of the 393 AmCham
members companies that responded) perceived a "good" or "
satisfactory" outlook in the coming year.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, the positive outlook for our economy is also widely
shared by the international community," Rowse said.
</P>
<P>
The continuous confidence in Hong Kong's business environment
is evidenced by the fact that 81 per cent of the 75 per cent of
companies that have regional headquarters in Hong Kong said they
would retain their regional base and one third of them said they
intended to expand their operations.
</P>
<P>
In assessing the business environment in Hong Kong, respondents
said that the five most satisfactory aspects of doing business in
Hong Kong are: geographical location, taxation system, free port
status, communication network and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong will continue to provide a positive environment for
people to do business," Rowse said.

<HEADLINE> China Steps up Wild Animal and Plant Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China will create more nature
reserves in the next five years to strengthen the protection of
wild animals and plants, according to Wang Zhibao, director of the
State Forestry Administration of China (SFAC).
</P>
<P>
From the years 2000 to 2005, the number of nature reserves
managed by the SFAC will increase from the current 776 to some 1,
000, he said at the National Conference on the Protection of Wild
Animals and Plants which opened here today.
</P>
<P>
The country also will ban hunting in 25 more areas and
establish 18 wild animal breeding bases, 6 wild plant cultivation
bases, and 32 wild animal and plant monitoring stations.
</P>
<P>
The latest SFAC statistics indicate that to date China has 1,
118 nature reserves totaling 80 million hectares, of which 135 are
state-level reserves. China also has 850 forest parks with a total
area of 7.5 million hectares.
</P>
<P>
These nature reserves shelter 85 percent of the country's wild
animal species and 65 percent of its wild plant species, he said,
adding that 7 reserves have been listed as important international
wetlands, and 3 have been placed on the World Natural Heritage
list by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization.
</P>
<P>
China has also scored considerable achievements in breeding and
cultivating endangered wild animals and plants. The country has
bred 96 giant pandas in 64 litters, and 61 of them have survived.
The number of ibis has jumped to 203 from only 7 in 1981, and more
than 1,000 rare wild plant species have been put under effective
protection.
</P>
<P>
Wang urged forestry departments nationwide to take further
steps to crack down on criminal activities such as illegal hunting,
smuggling, and illegal trading in wild animals and plants.
</P>
<P>
China has issued the Law on Wild Animal Protection and the Law
on Wild Plant Protection, and in the last five years more than 70,
000 violations of these laws have been investigated.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the conference, the SFAC awarded
Giant Panda Medals to 10 people for their outstanding
contributions to wild life protection, including Zhang Hemin, a
renowned giant panda specialist in Sichuan Province, and Zhao
Zhongxiang, China Central Television's famous anchorman.
</P>
<P>
The conference will run through December 18.

ISLAMABAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister
Shaukat Aziz Thursday projected over 4 percent growth rate during
the current fiscal in the backdrop of upbeat performance in the
agriculture and textile sector.
</P>
<P>
"The growth rate has been projected on the basis of emerging
economic situation," he told a press conference here while
explaining the features of the new economic agenda announced by
Chief Executive General Pervaiz Musharraf on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Flanked by other key economic officials, Aziz said in a
categorical term that the new government package was home-grown
and carved out without any pre-consultation with Bretton Woods
institutions.
</P>
<P>
General Musharraf Wednesday announced an economic revival plan
which is targeted at establishing a self-reliant economy.
</P>
<P>
Commerce Minister Abdul Razzaq Daud disclosed that country's
exports recorded 14 percent growth in November and the yearly
target of 9 billion U.S. dollars would likely to be surpassed.
</P>
<P>
Azuz said despite stable reserves position of the foreign
exchange, the pressure on balance of payment still persist as
trade deficit experienced 36 percent deterioration during the last
five months.
</P>
<P>
He did not rule out possibility of seeking further debt
rescheduling depending upon "the country's cash flow conditions".
"We will continue to review and re-profile the debt position," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Among the several initiatives taken in this respect, he said, a
high-level special committee has been constituted to study and
keep strict vigil on the country's debt profile.
</P>
<P>
He made a mention about the rescheduling arrangements already
made with the Paris Club, London Club and through exchange of
eurobonds, which totaled over 2.3 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said the present rescheduling is available for period of
one to two years, adding that "if required by the cash flow
position, further rescheduling could be considered."

<HEADLINE> China's Auditors Play Bigger Role in Anti-Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Signs show that China's
auditors are now playing a bigger role in the country's anti-
corruption drive.
</P>
<P>
Auditor General Li Jinhua announced here today that auditors
have so far this year audited 112,000 institutions, saving losses
up to 29.8 billion yuan and discovering 1,458 cases of
irregularities.
</P>
<P>
He made the disclosure at a press conference sponsored by the
Press Office of the State Council.
</P>
<P>
At the 10th meeting of the Standing Committee of the National
People Congress last June, the auditors made their first shocking
disclosure about the serious misuse of funds by the ministries of
Finance and Water Resources and other government departments.
</P>
<P>
According to Li, 1.8 billion yuan of the misused funds have
been recovered, while some of the office and hotel buildings built
with misused funds have been confiscated for auction.
</P>
<P>
Persons involved in these cases have received in-Party or
administrative sanctions, while some others are under
investigation by the Ministry of Supervision, the auditor general
said.
</P>
<P>
For the fourth year, the auditors reviewed the implementation
of the government budget this year and found some serious problems,
most of which have been or are being corrected.
</P>
<P>
In auditing the Commerce and Industry Bank of China and the
Construction Bank of China, the auditors found that their
management and loan quality have greatly improved, but there is
still much to be done.
</P>
<P>
"Bad loans account for more than 10 percent of the banks' total
loans in many cases, some even higher," the auditor general said.
</P>
<P>
Auditing was also done in 45 large and medium-sized state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), leading to the discovery of false financial
reports on assets and liabilities and the loss of state-owned
assets.
</P>
<P>
In the first 11 months, the auditors audited 17,000 officials
at county level and SOE leaders. About 10 percent of them were
found to have problems for which they were demoted or further
investigated, Li said.
</P>
<P>
The auditors also played an important role in the
investigations of 28 major economic criminal cases by providing
evidence found in their auditing work.
</P>
<P>
Among them are the stock market fraud case involving the Daqing
Lianyi Co., Ltd. and serious smuggling cases in Zhanjiang City of
Guangdong Province in south China.
</P>
<P>
The auditor general said the work of the auditors clearly shows
the Chinese government's determination to crack down on corruption
and improve the transparency of the economic system.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that the auditors would next year focus on the
auditing of the government budget implementation, financial
management of enterprises and banking organizations.

a series of sanctions imposed after the DPRK fired a rocket over
Japan last August.
</P>
<P>
Talks on normalizing ties between the Japan and the DPRK began
in January 1991, but collapsed after eight rounds in November 1992.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed in August 1998 to restart the talks,
but Tokyo froze the initiative after Pyongyang launched later that
month a multistage rocket, part of which flew over Japan into the
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
Tokyo and Pyongyang saw a thaw in their bilateral ties after a
visit to Pyongyang earlier this month by former Japanese Prime
Minister Tomiichi Murayama and a nonpartisan mission of lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese mission agreed with the DPRK's Workers' Party of
Korea to urge their respective governments to resume talks on
normalizing bilateral diplomatic ties.

<HEADLINE> Israel's November Consumer Price Index Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua)-- Israel's consumer price index
(CPI) posted a 0.2 percent drop in November, enough to fuel
expectations of a sizable drop in interest rate later but not
enough for economists to revise their inflation forecast for next
year.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1999, the CPI has only risen 1.3 percent
and for the whole 1999 it is expected to close at about 1.5
percent, according to figures issued by the Central Bureau of
Statistics (CBS) Thursday.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Bank of Israel, the central bank, is expected to
lower interest rates next month by 0.5 percent, and local
economists forecast that inflation rate for next year is expected
to be less than 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
November's decline reflected a seasonal reduction in product
prices and a fall in prices in the housing sector. The drop was
partially offset by a seasonal rise in clothing and footwear
prices.
</P>
<P>
November's price changes covered such sectors as food, up by
only 0.1 percent, fruit and vegetables, down by 2.6 percent,
housing, down by 1.2 percent, housing service, down by 1.3 percent,
 while clothing and footwear, up by 4.4 percent and health, up by
0.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Wholesale Price Index for industrial production for domestic
 use rose by 0.1 percent in November, and prices for housing starts
 fell by 0.1 percent too.
</P>
<P>
The Manufacturers' Association said that 1999's low rate and
expectations of lower inflation in 2000 will enable Israel's
industrial sector to undertake a number of steps to maintain
sustainable growth, to implement reforms in direct taxation and to
change monetary and fiscal policies in order to lay the foundation
for long-term growth.

<HEADLINE> China to Host Photography Equipment Fair </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China will host the Third
International Photograph and Electronic Imaging Machinery and
Technology Fair from April 18 to 24 next year in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Sponsored by the State Administration of Machinery Industry (
SAMI), the fair will provide an opportunity for Chinese camera
makers to exchange ideas with their foreign counterparts and
promote the development of the industry, said Wang Bingnan, a SAMI
official.
</P>
<P>
During the seven-day display, there will be symposiums on many
topics dealing with digital technologies. The exposition will also
become the venue for technology communications, information
briefings and trading.
</P>
<P>
Wang noted that China is now both a major manufacturer and
consumer of photography equipment. In 1998, the country produced
60 million cameras, earning one billion US dollars in export
revenue.
</P>
<P>
But China has 1.2 billion people, and though there are thirty
cameras for every one hundred families in the urban area, in the
countryside there are only three for every one hundred families.
</P>
<P>
Wang predicts that with improvement of living standards, the
annual demand for cameras in China will increase to 12 to 15
million in a few years.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that the technology and production levels of China'
s photographic industry still lag behind those developed countries,
pointing out that the high-quality and digital cameras now selling
in China are mostly imported.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges Turkey to Pull Out From Northern Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has condemned "fresh
Turkish aggression" on its northern territories and urged Ankara to
 pull out its troops immediately.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said Thursday that on November 30, another 1,000
Turkish soldiers entered into northern Iraq's Kanimasi area.
</P>
<P>
An unidentified Foreign Ministry spokesman said that with the
support of tanks, heavy artillery and helicopters, other Turkish
armed troops already stationed in northern Iraq continued their
military aggression against Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
He said Iraq absolutely rejects the flimsy pretexts Turkey has
used to justify its repeated aggressions against Iraqi territories.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has claimed that its military operations in northern Iraq
 are aimed at cracking down on outlawed rebels of Turkish Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) who have been fighting for independence since
1984.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Turkey's new aggression coincided with the
aggressive military acts carried out by the U.S. and Britain
against Iraq to interfere in its internal affairs and to perpetuate
 the abnormal status in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
U.S. and British warplanes coming from Turkish airspace patrol
the northern no-fly zone in Iraq set up following the 1991 Gulf War
 with the claimed aim of protecting the Iraqi Kurds there against
possible attacks by Iraqi government troops.
</P>
<P>
After the Gulf War, Baghdad lost control over the northern
Kurdish autonomous region, and Turkish government troops often
launched cross-border offensives against rebels of PKK who have
been seeking shelters there.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq holds Turkey responsible for the consequences of its
repeated aggressive acts and violation of Iraq's sovereignty and
territorial integrity," warned the spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Unveils Previously Undisclosed 163 Aircraft Orders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest airplane maker, Wednesday unveiled 163 aircraft orders,
boosting its total for 1999 to 368 orders, according to reports
from the company.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said the 163 orders, worth 9.5 billion U.S. dollars, had
not been disclosed before at the request of customers. The
announcement from the company's commercial airplanes division also
includes a 2.6 billion-dollar-order for 20 airplanes placed by
General Electric Co.'s GE Capital Aviation Services unit.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said it has adopted an industry-wide practice and is
counting all orders, including those placed by customers who wish
to remain unidentified.
</P>
<P>
Until now, policy has prevented Boeing from announcing any firm
orders until the buyer can be named. Airlines and other buyers
don't want their orders revealed for competitive, financing or
strategic reasons.
</P>
<P>
However, rival Airbus Industries, the European aerospace
consortium, already includes certain orders from unnamed customers
in its totals.
</P>
<P>
Boeing's move appears designed to reduce Airbus's huge lead in
jet orders for this year. Airbus has about 417 firm orders so far,
nearly a 60 percent share of the companies' combined total.
</P>
<P>
Of the 163 plane orders by unidentified customers, 132 are for
737s, 14 for 757s, 12 for 767s, four 777s and one 747.
</P>
<P>
The company said it expects to end the year with a record
delivery of about 620 jetliners, compared with 563 deliveries last
year. However, Boeing expects its production to drop by about 23
percent to about 480 planes in 2000.
</P>
<P>
Announcement of previously unidentified orders aims at boosting
the company's competitive image, industry sources said. The
posturing over order totals is part of an annual ritual that has
become more meaningful as Airbus has become a stronger rival for
Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. jet maker once dominated at least two-thirds of orders
and sales by every measure. Orders are an indication of future
sales and revenue, but the totals can be deceiving. Orders are
often canceled or delayed when airlines weaken financially.

<HEADLINE> France Warns Israel, Syria Not to Sacrifice Palestinians </HEADLINE>

<P>
PARIS, December 16 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine said Thursday that Israel and Syria are having a good
chance to make peace, but they should not sacrifice the
Palestinians in their deal.
</P>
<P>
"The peace in the Middle East should be total," he said in an
interview with Radio-Television Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel and Syria, after making profound calculations,
have decided to engage in a peace process rather than keeping the
status quo.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that it is now easier for Israel to
make peace with Syria than with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"Our vigilance will be to make sure that the Palestinians not
be sacrificed in this affair,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Syria resumed their peace talks on Wednesday in

<HEADLINE> Iraq to Restart Oil Exports on Friday: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Iraq is planning to restart its
 oil exports to world markets on Friday under the newly-approved
seventh phase of the oil-for-food program, an Iraqi daily reported
on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Ath-Thawra daily, of the ruling Baath party, quoted an
unnamed official as saying that the implementation of the plan
depends on the approval of Iraq's oil contracts by the U.N.
Sanctions Committee and the arrival of oil tankers at the Turkish
Ceyhan port and southern Iraq's Bakr oil terminal.
</P>
<P>
Under relevant U.N. Security Council resolutions, Iraq's
contracts for selling oil and importing goods must first be
approved by the U.N. Sanctions Committee before any shipment can be
 made.
</P>
<P>
The official said that Iraq had started to sign contracts on
Monday with foreign companies to sell crude oil under the new phase
 of the humanitarian program.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Security Council last Friday unanimously approved a
six-month extension of the program which allows Iraq to sell 5.2
billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food, medicine and other
relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
The program was designed to alleviate the suffering of Iraqi
people reeling under the stringent U.N. sanctions imposed since
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq halted its oil exports on November 24 to protest over a
two-week extension of the sixth phase of the oil-for-food deal
which expired on November 20.
</P>
<P>
The halt continued and the Security Council extended the program
 for an additional week after the first two-week extension expired.
</P>
<P>
Iraq insisted that it needed a normal six-month rollover of the
program in order to plan properly.

<HEADLINE> Russia Denies Western Reports of Its Heavy Loss in Grozny </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Russian military Thursday
categorically denied Western media reports on heavy losses of a
Russian armored column last night in Grozny, capital of the
rebellious Chechen republic.
</P>
<P>
Western media earlier reported that over 100 Russian soldiers
were killed during a Wednesday night battle in Grozny, when
thousands of Chechen rebels surrounded the federal troops and
pounded them with rocket-propelled grenades.
</P>
<P>
The battle scene, a square near central Grozny, was littered
with the bodies of the dead and blazing armored vehicles, said a
Reuters report Thursday.
</P>
<P>
However, Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev Thursday
called the reports "an information provocation," stressing that "
there was no assault and there will be no assault on Grozny."
</P>
<P>
"We are to find out who has launched this information
provocation," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Defense Ministry's press service Thursday denied
the Western reports about an attempt by Russian troops to storm
Grozny last night.
</P>
<P>
Colonel General Valery Manilov, first deputy chief of the
Russian General Staff, also stated that the Russian federal
command did not launch any assault on Grozny last night.
</P>
<P>
"Reports about the defeat of a Russian armored column by the
rebels in Grozny's Minutka Square are lies and misinformation," he
told press Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
"No Russian armored vehicles have entered the city" and Grozny
"will not be stormed until civilians are evacuated," he said.
</P>
<P>
Chief of the Russian Federal Security Service's Public
Relations Center, General Alexander Zdanovich, said Thursday that
the reports "may be deliberate misinformation."
</P>
<P>
"I do not rule out that the spreading of such reports is a
special move, made on the eve of the parliamentary elections in
Russia in order to put pressure on the government and blame it for
poorly-planned actions in Chechnya," Zdanovich said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that most of the foreign agencies' correspondents in
Grozny are Chechens. Some of them may have sent out such reports
under the pressure of the rebels, while others are connected with
the Chechen special services, he said.

<HEADLINE> 11 People Killed in Taxi Crash in S.Africa </HEADLINE>

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Eleven people were killed
and four seriously injured in a four-vehicle pile-up outside
Komatipoort in Mpumalanga of South Africa on Thursday, South
African Press Association reported.
</P>

minibus taxi.
</P>
<P>
Burger said the second taxi tried to swerve and drove over some

<HEADLINE> Survey: Optimism Returning to HK's Business Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Hong Kong, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Two years after the Asian
economic crisis began, renewed, though cautious, optimism is
returning to Hong Kong's business environment, according to a
survey released by the American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) here
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Findings show that 84 percent of AmCham member companies
responding to the survey foresee a "good" or "satisfactory"
outlook for the year 2000, compared with only 54 percent forecast
for 1999.
</P>
<P>
"The results suggest that the Hong Kong economy is recovering,
with greater recovery occurring within the next year. After a
painful two-year process of corporate downsizing and lower profits,
this is encouraging news for the American business community and
for Hong Kong," AmCham Chairman Jason Felton said at a press
conference, where the survey was published.
</P>
<P>
AmCham's 1999 Business Outlook Survey, conducted by ACNielsen,
was mailed to 1,036 corporate representatives and a total of 393
responses were received between October 4 and November 5,
representing a 38 percent response rate.
</P>
<P>
The survey results also suggest the business environment of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) will improve
sharply in 2001 with respondents expecting this positive outlook
to be sustained through 2004.
</P>
<P>
Against this backdrop, 53 percent of the member companies plan
to expand business in Hong Kong, as against 46 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Another finding this year is that of the 75 percent of
respondents that have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, 81
percent said they would retain their regional base here, while 15
percent were "unsure" of whether their headquarters would remain
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"Given that the bulk of survey responses were collected during
the month of October -- just prior to the announcement of the
Disney deal, the landmark U.S.-China WTO Agreement, and other
confidence-building economic indicators -- I am confident that,
had our survey been conducted a few weeks later, much of this
uncertainty would have evaporated," AmCham President Frank Martin
said at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
Martin attributed the confidence of American companies in the
outlook for the business environment in Hong Kong and for the
future of Hong Kong to three major factors.
</P>
<P>
"The first is there is widely-held view that the worst of
regional economic crisis is now behind us and that the recovery we
are currently experiencing will continue into the future although
at times there maybe some setbacks in the individual countries in
the Asia-Pacific region," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report released by the Hong Kong government last
month, the gross domestic product of Hong Kong grew 4.5 percent in
real terms in the third quarter of 1999 over a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Martin said the second factor was that American companies are
very pleased that the "One Country, Two Systems" principle is
working and they are confident that will continue to be the case
in the future.
</P>
<P>
"The third reason is that there is recognition that Hong Kong
has one of the best legal systems in the Asia-Pacific region. It
is an open, transparent, dependable system and the judicial area
is not subject to corruption as it is elsewhere in the region," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Martin also said that many reports by the western media
predicting doom for Hong Kong and the death of the legal systems
of Hong Kong after its return to China were wrong.
</P>
<P>
"From the business perspective, we believe that events have
subsequently proven that our view was correct that the transition
would go smoothly and would be without any real major incidents
that would cause confidence in the commercial sector to erode," he
said.
</P>
<P>
AmCham member companies continue to value and assess highly
Hong Kong's geographical location, communications network,
taxation system, free port status, and infrastructure, while the
quality of the environment, costs of doing business, and human
resources quality and costs are still Hong Kong's key weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
In terms of factors that affect their business decisions,
companies indicated that the maintenance of a strong legal and
regulatory system, and the availability of high quality personnel
were their top considerations.
</P>
<P>
Turning to China, Martin said that China's moves toward the
World Trade Organization accession in the wake of the summit
meeting between U.S. President Bill Clinton and Chinese President
Jiang Zemin during the Auckland Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum in early September had "positively buoyed confidence levels
toward the China market."
</P>
<P>
According to the survey, 97 percent, up from 91 percent in 1998,
of respondents believe the outlook for the business climate in the
mainland of China over the next five years will be favorable, with
a huge increase in the proportion of respondents predicting a "
very favorable" outlook, up from 19 percent in 1998 to 61 percent
in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-five percent of respondents currently have operations
in China and the survey results suggest that this trend is likely
to continue.
</P>
<P>
The main disincentives to investing in China include uneven
rules and regulations, bureaucracy and corruption. Companies also
face difficulties due to the lack of protection for intellectual
property rights, and to the deteriorating environment, according
to the annual survey, which began to be conducted in 1990.

<HEADLINE> HK to Enhance Economic Relations with Macao: Tung </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) Tung Chee Hwa
Thursday said that Hong Kong will further enhance the economic
cooperation with Macao after its return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Tung said the future cooperation between Hong Kong and Macao is
promising. The cooperative projects will be planed in tourism
industry and joint efforts will be made to develop the area of
Pearl River Delta with Guangdong Province.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference this afternoon, Tung said that
the concept of "One Country, Two Systems" has been well-
implemented in Hong Kong in all aspects of life over the past two
and a half years, adding that he believes that it will also be
well-implemented in Macao.
</P>
<P>
Tung said he is optimistic about the future of Macao and the
success of the reunification of the motherland since what Hong
Kong has done over the past years proved that the concept of "One
Country, Two Systems" is correct and powerful.
</P>
<P>
"China's resumption of sovereignty over Macao is the pride of
the nation and it is very precious opportunity to witness another
celebration of historical significance," Tung said. He will attend
the ceremony to be held in Macao on December 20, 1999.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong's experience must be helpful to the newly-born Macao'
s SAR government, Tung said, adding that "on one hand, we must
spare no effort to maintain the two systems, and on the other we
must be active in helping the Hong Kong people know more about the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
Over the past years, the Hong Kong SAR government has played an
important role in the construction of Hong Kong's economy,
especially in infrastructure, including the construction of
airport, roads and tourism facilities, Tung said.
</P>
<P>
"The government should help create favorable environment for
local people to display their talents and capacity," he said. "In
addition to the hardware, we have helped create favorable software
environment, including investment in education and living
environment."

<HEADLINE> Computer Virus Plays Havoc in Addis Ababa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Computer systems in
several government offices, business concerns and non-governmental
organizations in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia became paralyzed under the
attack of a computer virus early this week, informed sources said
here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to local experts, the unidentified computer virus was
 programmed to trigger havoc on December 13, it must have been
transmitted from one terminal to another through diskettes or
perhaps the e-mail system over a long period of time.
</P>
<P>
Most of the anti-virus available in Addis Ababa does not
recognize this virus, which destructs all system files and folders
in the affected computers, local computer dealers said.
</P>
<P>
An unconfirmed report said a local bank and computer dealer
were also among those victimized.
</P>
<P>
The experts have warned computer users to install virus
scanners and exercise utmost caution in using diskettes from
outside their offices.

<HEADLINE> Turkey, Israel, U.S. Launch Joint Naval Exercises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkey, Israel and the United
States have conducted one-day joint naval maneuvers in the
Mediterranean off Turkey's southwestern resort of Marmaris,
reported the Anatolia News Agency on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The exercises, code-named "Reliant Mermaid-99" and expected to
conclude on Thursday morning, involved two Turkish frigates, two
Turkish coast guard vessels, an Israeli frigate, an Israeli assault
 vessel, a U.S. guided-missile frigate and a U.S. marine patrol
aircraft.
</P>
<P>
According to the excercise's scenario, warships from the three
countries sailing in international waters off the coast of southern
 Turkey will respond to two different distress calls from ships in
the area. The warships then will begin coordiating rescue
operations.
</P>
<P>
The start of the maneuvers coincided with the resumption of the
peace talks between Israel and Syria in Washington after the two
sides broke off dialogue for nearly four years.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Arab world calmly responded to the
search and rescue excercises, compared to a previous maneuver. Last
 time, the three sides held exercises in January 1998, some Arab
states voiced strong condemnations, saying that the operations
posed a threat against them.
</P>
<P>
"The sole objective of this excercise is to practice coordinated
 emergency search and rescue procedures for assisting people in
distress at sea," said Capt. Ahmet Aksoy at a naval base near
Marmaris on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
THe Turkish officer stressed that the scenario has no connection
 with what he called "real world" situation and has no political
implications.
</P>
<P>
However, A U.S. naval officer, Lt. Cdr. Scott Gurek, admitted
that the Mediterrnean excercises made sense for the countries
involved. He explained that Turkey and Israel have very close ties
and "of course it is in our interests to cooperate and work
together."
</P>
<P>
Jordan originally declined to participate in the maneuvers but
changed its mind at the last minute and sent a rear admiral to
observe, while Egypt failed to reply to an invitation, a Turkish
military official was quoted as saying.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Singapore Bilateral Trade Grows by 5.7 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Bilateral trade between
China and Singapore reached 13.1 billion Singapore dollars (7.8
billion U.S. dollars) for the first 10 months of 1999,
representing a growth of 5.7 percent compared with the same period
last year, a senior trade officer from Singapore Trade Development
Board (TDB) told a press conference Thursday.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference held to brief media on the result of
TDB's promotional and facilitation efforts to strengthen Singapore
's external trade wing, Ko Khee Hwee, director for the
International Operation in East Asia and Pacific, TDB, also said
that as trade between the two countries has been rising rapidly
since 1990, the TDB expects the total bilateral trade for 1999 to
exceed 15 billion Singapore dollars (8.93 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
"With China's impending accession to the WTO," Ko said, "we
expect Sino-Singapore to strengthen further as Singapore business
gain greater market access."
</P>
<P>
"Singapore exporters of IT products and chemicals will also
stand to benefit from the anticipated lowering of tariffs for
these products, which are amongst Singapore's major items of
export to China," Ko added.
</P>
<P>
Ko underlined that China has made significant advances in the
field of biotechnology and precision science and Singapore
companies could collaborate with renowned Chinese research
institutions to commercialize their innovations.
</P>
<P>
"Riding on this wave of opportunities in China," Ko pointed out,
"TDB plans to intensify its efforts in key sectors such as
telecommunications, IT, e-commerce service and biotechnology."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, TDB cited as an example the MarinEx
Pharmaceuticals (Singapore) Pte Ltd which has signed a technology
transfer agreement with the Qingdao Ocean University, China, to
acquire the rights to develop, produce, market and distribute a
marine-based burn cream product, a technology originally developed
by the Qingdao Ocean University.
</P>
<P>
Another example given out is the biotechnology company of
Floritech which recently tied up with a Singapore research
institute to commercialize the production of disease-resistant and
high quality flowers and plants and is further expanding their
production bases in China with the assistance from TDB.
</P>
<P>
Over the years, Sino-Singapore trade has been the highest in
volume out of that between China and Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> Iran Not to Air Film on Confession of Serial Murders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A special committee has advised
the Iranian authorities not to air the film on the confessions of
those involved in the serial killings of Iranian opposition leaders
 and dissident writers.
</P>
<P>
Local daily Tehran Times on Thursday quoted an unidientified
source as saying that Iranian President Mohammad Khatami formed a
four-member special committee on behalf of the Supreme National
Security Council to decide whether it is advisable to air the film
or not.
</P>
<P>
"After watching the film, the committee advised that the film
should not be broadcast on the TV, but gave no specific reasons,"
the source said.
</P>
<P>
The Judicial Organization of the Iranian armed forces has
promised to broadcast the film through the state-run television in
November.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the daily quoted Intelligence Minister Ali Yunesi as
saying that the film had some problems which should be removed.
</P>
<P>
In November and December last year, the leader of the Iran
Nation Party Darius Forouhar and his wife were stabbed to death at
home and at least three dissident writers were mysteriously killed
in Tehran.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Intelligence Ministry announced in January that some of
its own agents were involved in the political murders. The
revelation triggered a sharp political quarrel between the
conservative and moderate factions and forced former Intelligence
Minister Qorbanali Dorri Najafabadi to resign.
</P>
<P>
Former Deputy Intelligence Minister for Political and Security
Affairs Saeed Emami was believed to be the mastermind behind the
political killings. But Emami committed suicide in prison June by
taking in depilatory substance while taking a bath.
</P>
<P>
Head of the Judicial Organization of the Iranian armed forces
Mohammad Niazi said earlier that a total of 23 people have been
arrested in connection of the political killings while 33 others
have been summoned for investigations.
</P>
<P>
However, local media believed that Emami was not the highest
agent behind the political killings, because he had no right to
issue religious verdicts against dissident writers.

<HEADLINE> No Attack Expected in Turkey Against American Targets: Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Turkish officials said they do
not expect any terrorist attack against U.S. targets by Bin Laden's
 followers in the country, Turkish Daily News reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Turkish intelligence sources said that small groups linked with
Laden's network did operate in Turkey, primarily in Istanbul and
Ankara, but these groups were involved exclusively in spreading the
 words of Islam, unlikely to attack U.S. targets in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Bin Laden, a Saudi-born millionaire who is reportedly living in
a secret hideout under Afgan Taliban protection, was charged by the
 U.S. of masterminding the twin bombings of American embassies in
Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
Recently, anxiety over the possibility of U.S. citizens in
Turkey being targeted by Ladan's followers has emerged after the U.
S. State Department warned its citizens abroad of possible
terrorist attacks by Laden during celebrations of the Christmas,
Ramadan and New Year.
</P>
<P>
Turkish intelligence sources said that so far there had been no
arrests made on Laden's followers as no evidence has been found on
these groups' involvement in any crime.
</P>
<P>
The sources stressed, however, that the Turkish intelligence
agency is keeping them under close scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
U.S. sources here said the warning was worldwide and that no
additional precautions had been taken regarding U.S. facilities in
Turkey.

<HEADLINE> Iran Voices Readiness to Export Gas to Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- An official from the Iranian
National Oil Company has voiced Tehran's readiness to export gas to
 Ankara according to a deal concluded in 1996, local daily Iran
News reported on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to dispatch our experts to help Turkey in making
preparations which has become urgent with the advent of winter,"
the unnamed official said in an interview with the daily.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the Turkish side appears not quite ready to
import 2 billion cubic meters of gas for the first year of the
contract, but it will be able to import 1 billion cubic meters
instead.
</P>
<P>
Under the contract, Turkey will pay 20 billion dollars for
buying gas from Iran in the next 25 years, some 2 billion cubic
meters of gas in the first year and the volume will be increased to
 10 billion cubic meters by 2006.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian official said that Iran is putting finishing touches
 to its natural gas pipeline link-up with Turkey, enabling it to
embark on transferring its natural gas to Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The length of gas pipeline in Iranian territory is about 260
kilometers while in Turkey about 300 kilometers, he said, adding
that head of the Turkey's pipeline company Botas would visit Iran
next week to discuss the issue.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's increasing gas consumption will reach 15.8 billion
cubic meters in 2000 and may approach 55 billion cubic meters in
2010, Iran News said.

<P>
WELLINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A photo exhibition on Macao
's return to China began here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Displayed at the Michael Fowler Center in downtown Wellington,
the 70 photos vividly record Macao's yesterday and today, and
reflect the desire of Macao residents for return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition is attracting many overseas Chinese residing in
Wellington and New Zealanders who are making effort to promote New
Zealand-China friendship.
</P>
<P>
While watching the exhibition carefully, a New Zealander of
Chinese origin told Xinhua that the concept of "one country, two
systems" initiated by the late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping is
very wise. The policy, which successfully solved the issue of Hong
Kong's return to China two years ago, will soon solve the issue of
Macao's.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the policy of "one country, two systems", which
has ensured Hong Kong's stability and prosperity after its return
to China, will also be a success in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition will last for a week.

<HEADLINE> New Zealand Dollar Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand dollar has
strengthened Thursday on the back of news that the New Zealand
government and the New Zealand central bank, the Reserve Bank,
have signed a new anti-inflation agreement.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that new Finance Minister Michael Cullen and
Reserve Bank Governor Don Brash have agreed on changes to
instructions for keeping inflation between zero and three percent.
</P>
<P>
The one significant change now states: "In pursuing its price
stability objective, the Bank shall implement monetary policy in a
sustainable, consistent and transparent manner and shall seek to
avoid unnecessary instability in output, interest rates and the
exchange rate."
</P>
<P>
The change means the Reserve Bank is now required to avoid
unnecessary instability in the economy, the currency and interest
rates, as it keeps inflation in check.
</P>
<P>
Minister Cullen said the change aims to stop the Reserve Bank
repeating its policy of the mid-90s, which saw the New Zealand
dollar rise damaging the export sector.
</P>
<P>
Governor Brash said he did not seek the change, but
nevertheless welcomed it, as it makes explicit the way monetary
policy in New Zealand has been evolving in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He said as the credibility of the monetary framework in New
Zealand continues to be further enhanced, so "instability in
output, interest rates and the exchange rate" should further
decline.

<HEADLINE> China to Promote CAD, CIMS Use in Manufacturing Enterprises </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The State Economic and Trade
Commission, the Ministry of Information Industry and the Ministry
of Science and Technology are drafting measures to push ahead
application of information technology in large and medium-sized
State-owned enterprises (SOEs).
</P>
<P>
Xu Guanhua, Vice-Minister of Science and Technology, said here
today that the use of computer aided design (CAD) and computer
integrated manufacturing systems (CIMS) in State-owned enterprises
of pillar industries will improve their technological innovation
capacity and market competitiveness.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening of the three-day national
conference on application of CAD and CIMS in manufacturing
ventures.
</P>
<P>
He said the wide application of CAD and CIMS in these
businesses will also help improve the overall national strength
and maintain national security in the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
China plans to initiate CAD or CIMS technology in over 90
percent of the large and medium-sized State-owned manufacturing
firms by the end of 2010.
</P>
<P>
Xu said, information technology involving micro-electronic and
software applications has had a great impact on world development.
</P>
<P>
Describing the manufacturing industry as the engine of the
national economy, the vice-minister said the industry is also
vital for supporting foreign trade and ensuring national security.
</P>
<P>
He pledged that government departments concerned will create
favorable conditions for the manufacturing ventures in fields of
technical development, risk investment and listing to make major
upgrades.
</P>
<P>
So far, over 90 percent of China's key firms in engineering
design and machinery industry have adopted CAD technology, and
quite a number of ventures in over a dozen industries have applied
CIMS in production and management. This will help them shorten the
time needed to design products and raise their product quality.
</P>
<P>
To date, China has held CAD and CIMS training programs for over
one million technicians.

coast of the South Island and off Southland. In each of these
areas dolphins had been found washed ashore with marks consistent
with being drowned in set nets," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Lebanese are slated to join in the peace talks with
Israel during the next round, a source close to the Israeli-Syrian
negotiations said in Washington Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the source, U.S. President Bill Clinton is pressing
 to include a Lebanese delegation in the talks as early as next
week, eager to bring the three parties together for a preliminary
meeting before the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- The first day of the Israeli-Syrian peace talks in Washington
 was marked by large differences between the two sides. The talks
were devoted largely to working out an agenda for the continuation
of the discussions.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak emphasized that for Israel the
 security arrangements are the paramount issue, while Syrian
Foreign Minister Farouq al-Sharaa declared that a peace agreement
must be based on a full Israeli withdrawal from the Golan Heights.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv:
</P>
<P>
-- Economists are revising their inflation forecasts for next
year and expecting a sizable drop in interest rates later in the
month following an announcement by Israel's Central Bureau of
Statistics Wednesday that consumer prices posted an unexpected 0.2
percent drop in November.
</P>
<P>
The decline was the first for the consumer price index since
March, slashing the rate of inflation over the last 12 months to 1.
4 percent and insuring that inflation for 2000 will be less than 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli President Ezer Weizman warned Wednesday that failure
to reach agreement with Syria would throw the region back into war
and would also affect Israel's relations with other countries in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Weizman was clearly bent on persuading coalition partners who
were not backing the prime minister of the advantages to peace.
Barak has kept him up-to-date on developments of the peace talks
with Syria, officials in his office said.

will be online in five years, while personal computers will remain
the dominant Internet access terminal, according to a study
released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Most homes will use a number of non-PC online appliances, but
PC won't be replaced, said the study of Strategy Analytics, a U.S.
market consulting business in high- technology.
</P>
<P>
By 2005, according to the study, 91 percent of American homes
will be online, 90 percent of them will be using an Internet PC,
73 percent will also have interactive TV or other Internet
appliances.
</P>
<P>
Online TV-based set-top boxes will become commonplace in
American homes. Limited demand also exists for a range of new
Internet terminals that are independent of the PC or TV, such as
screephones and Web terminals. Sales of such devices will reach
600 million U.S. dollars in 2005.
</P>
<P>
Sales of interactive TV appliances, such as online digital TV
set-top boxes and advanced games consoles, will reach 2.4 billion
dollars in 2002. Sales will peak at 4.8 billion dollars in 2003,
before declining to 4.2 billion dollars in 2005 under the impact
of falling prices. Shipments, however, are expected to reach 7.4
million units in 2000 and 26.4 million units by 2005.
</P>
<P>
On average, a U.S. online home will have 2.7 online devices by
2005, according to the study. This represents an emerging
opportunity for Internet service providers and network operators.
</P>
<P>
According to the research company Yankee Group, approximately
650,000 U.S. homes have some form of networking installed now, and
the number is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of
95 percent over the next four years, when it will reach 10 million
by 2003.

WASHINGTON -- The Syrian and Israeli negotiation teams held
about 80 minutes of talks with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright attendance at the U.S. official guest house, Blair House,
on Wednesday after an opening ceremony at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The talks then adjourned until Thursday's 11:00 a.m. (1600 GMT).
No substantive details of the talks were released because of
effective news blackout for the two days of negotiations. White
House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a briefing after the Blair House
meeting at 4:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) that Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara discussed with
Albright how to move toward a peace agreement, which Middle East
experts believe could not be reached until the settlement of the
dispute over the Golan Heights, the Syrian territory snatched by
Israel during the 1967 six-day war. (US-Israel-Syria)

that he and U.S. President Bill Clinton had agreed on a fund of 10
billion marks (4.7 billion U.S. dollars) to compensate millions of
slave laborers during Germany's Nazi era, ending year-long
negotiations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he and Clinton had agreed both on the sum and
measures to protect German firms against new legal demands for
further compensations on the issue. The chief U.S. negotiator,
Deputy Secretary of Treasury Stuart Eizenstat, flew to Berlin on
Wednesday evening in an effort to hammer out with his German
counterpart Otto Graf Lambsdorff the details of a final German-U.S.
solution that will be signed on Friday at the G-8 Foreign

crisis caused Tuesday by President Emil Constantinescu's order to
remove Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
</P>
<P>
Ion Iliescu, chairman of the Romanian Social Democracy Party,
stressed in the appeal that the country's law gives only the
parliament, not the president, the authority to sack the prime
minister, and therefore urged the president and the ruling
coalition to "correct their error." He told the press that the
crisis can be resolved properly only by a parliamentary vote of no-
confidence on the government given Vasile's refusal to resign. But
first of all, the president should retract his order, which is
unconstitutional, he demanded. (Romania-Government Crisis)

<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A lake on the outskirts of
Rongcheng, a coastal city in east China's Shandong Province, has
drawn some 2,400 brants, a variety of goose, which are now living
there together with thousands of rare birds including swans, other
wide geese, and grey cranes.
</P>
<P>
There are a total of 2,398 brants now at the lake, according to
Lu Jianjian, a waterfowl expert.
</P>
<P>
Brants are entirely black except for a ring of white feathers
on their necks. The birds eat seaweed, and are very rare, and at
one time were found only in Japan, said the expert.
</P>
<P>
Due to the environmental protection efforts of the local
government, many more rare birds now inhabit the lake.
</P>
<P>
The lake currently has become a paradise for tens of thousands
of birds, many of them rare, Lu noted.
</P>
<P>
The city also has carried out environment-friendly renovations
of 80 industrial projects which caused pollution in recent years,
and a paper mill and 17 fishmeal plants were shut down.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the city has set up a sewage treatment system,
handling some 20,000 tons of sewage per day. In addition, ten
stations supervising the marine environment now have been set up
in Rongcheng.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Govt Asked to Try Human Right Abusers in Aceh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's House of
Representative (DPR) Thursday issued a recommendation to the
government on the settlement of Aceh issue.
</P>
<P>
In its recommendation, the House pressed the government soon to
bring into justice those who have allegedly involved in the human
right abuse and committed atrocities in the predominantly Muslim
province of Aceh.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that human right abusers and those who had
committed atrocities in the province be brought to justice very
soon," said Ali Yahya, spokesman of the House special committee on
Aceh case.
</P>
<P>
The recommendation was endorsed by the plenary session here
Thursday after the House's special team on Aceh completed its task
in collecting data and information in connection with the Aceh
case.
</P>
<P>
Aceh, the most-western province of Indonesia, now has been
demanding a referendum for independence from the unitary state of
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
The demands for referendum and self determination was sponsored
by the Free Aceh Movement (GAM), an underground movement in the
province which had been launching a fighting against central
government over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid earlier had agreed to conduct a
referendum in Aceh, but it was not intended to give a chance for
the province to separate from Indonesia, saying the government
would not tolerate any kind of separatist movements.
</P>
<P>
"The Aceh affair is not merely a local issue, but has been a
national issue which should be solved very soon. Human right
abusers have to be tried as soon as possible," Yahya said.
</P>
<P>
But however the recommendation didn't specify the referendum
demands which now have been asked by Acehnese.
</P>
<P>
"And referendum demands from Acehnese have to be discussed
seriously and comprehensively," he said.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze Becomes Major Source of Pollution for Coastal Zhejiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Yangtze River has become
the major source of pollution for the coastal area of east China's
Zhejiang Province, a survey shows.
</P>
<P>
Zhejiang's coastal area receives one third of the total runoff
of the Yangtze, and the pollution caused by it has far exceeded
that of the rivers in Zhejiang, according to a survey conducted by
the National Bureau of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
The 6,300-km-long Yangtze, China's longest river, carries a
significant amount of pollutants into the sea as it flows through
many industrial cities including Shanghai, the survey says.
</P>
<P>
This also caused frequent occurrences of red tides in the East
China Sea. According to statistics, China had 265 red tides from
1993 to 1997, half of which occurred in the East China Sea.
</P>
<P>
Eight rivers in the province, including the Qiantang River,
also release pollutants into its coastal areas, according to the
survey.

<HEADLINE> Macao on Track of Economy Recovery (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Macao reported a foreign trade
volume of 25.4 billion patacas in the first ten months of this
year, an increase of 4.7 percent over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, Macao's exports in September was
up by 16.7 percent over the same previous month, indicating that
Macao is well on track of a fairly fast economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
Though the export-oriented Macao economy saw negative growth in
1998 under the negative influence of the Asia financial crisis, it
is now recovering with vigor thanks to a timely restructuring and
improved confidence of investors in the future of post-return
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, the inflow of overseas funds
has pick up speed, with Macao's foreign exchange reserve swelling
to nearly 20 billion patacas, ten times the figure eight years ago.
</P>
<P>
At present, banks from Britain, the United States, Germany,
France, Portugal, Hong Kong and Taiwan have established operations
in Macao, their combined assets reaching more than 50 billion
patacas. Macao's highly internationalized financial industry has
become one of the four pillars of the local economy. An official
from the local branch of a French Bank said that Macao will serve
as an effective channel for banking business that is oriented for
the China market.
</P>
<P>
And nothing could have linked Macao more closely with the world
economy than its gaming and tourism industry. Last year, Macao
received more than 6.94 million visitors from outside the region,
17 times the local population. In the ten months of this year, in
the run-up to Macao's return to China on December 20, more than 6.
1 million tourists from around the world thronged to Macao, up 6.2
percent over the same period of last year.

<TEXT>
<P>
Macao's industrial output value totaled 15.57 billion patacas
in 1998 and 70 percent of its industrial products were sold on
overseas markets. Macao is now restructuring its industry in an
attempt to change its economy's excessive reliance on a single
source for revenue generation -- tourism and gambling -- and lack
of complementarity among its major economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
An official of the Economic Services of the Macao government
said that China's accession to the World Trade Organization (WTO)
is not expected to affect Macao's export industry adversely. On
the contrary, observers from both Macao and the Chinese mainland
say that the openness of the mainland market will draw more funds
and technology into Macao.
</P>
<P>
After it reverts to Chinese rule, Macao will become an
effective window for exchanges -- economic, trade, and otherwise --
between the mainland and the rest of the world. Macao has
established trade links with more than 120 countries and regions
in the world and participated in a number of international
economic organizations. After December 20, 1999, Macao will
continue to be a member of many international organizations and a
signatory of many international treaties. For example, Macao will
continue to enjoy trade arrangements as a member of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
So far Macao's international airport links the region with
about 30 cities around the world. By 2000, it is expected to
receive 2.5 million passengers a year to become one of the air
transportation hubs in south China.
</P>
<P>
As Macao's handover approaches, the Macao pataca, which is
freely convertible, has remained stable. Since the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) to be established on December 20 will
maintain a high degree of autonomy in tax, finance, currency and
tariff policies, Macao will become even more internationalized
after its return to China. It is expected to maintain its status
as a successful mini-economy in the world.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Macao-Born Portuguese: Macao, Our Home (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The emblem of Associacao dos
Macaenses (Association of Macao-Born Portuguese) is unique and eye-
catching with designs of "Guia Lighthouse", built by Portuguese in
1865, "A-Ma Temple", a typical Chinese architecture built over 500
years ago, and the Map of Macao.
</P>
<P>
"Macanese" is a Portuguese expression for Macao-born Portuguese
or Macao-born mixed-blood of Portuguese and Chinese or of
Portuguese and other Asian ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
The emblem reflects the special ties between Macao-born
Portuguese and Macao and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of us will not leave Macao," said Dr. Luiz F.D.S.
Pedruco, president of the association, "because Macao has long
been our home."
</P>
<P>
On December 13, one week before the founding of the Macao
Special Administrative Region (MSAR) of the People's Republic of
China (PRC), this three-year-old association finally has its own
office in a downtown apartment. "It demonstrates that we have
taken root here," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
"One who is planning to move somewhere will never bother to
find a new house," explained the Macao-born Portuguese who speaks
both fluent Portuguese and Cantonese. "However, after the handover,
all of us should learn to speak Putonghua (Chinese Mandarin)," he
said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that there are more than 10,000 Macao-
born Portuguese or mix-blood among Macao's 430,000 population.
They are a unique part of Macao people who are raised in two
different cultures since their childhood.
</P>
<P>
Macao-born Portuguese and the mix-blood who better understand
Chinese and European cultures can play their due role in the Sino-
Portuguese relations or Sino-Western relations, he noted.
</P>
<P>
There has been concerns about whether Macao-born Portuguese are
going to leave after China resumes its exercise of sovereignty
over the region on December 20.
</P>
<P>
Facts speak louder than words.

Rita Botelho Dos Santos, Estefania's aunt who patronized her
niece for university study, said, "I will be very happy to see
that our younger generation could live well in Macao." Being a
senior government official, Rita is now busy learning songs to be
sung at the handover celebrations.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely a right decision for us to stay," said Rita,
noting that according to the basic law of the MSAR, the rights and
interests of Macao-born Portuguese and the mix-blood as well as
their customs and culture will be respected and protected and
those who work with the government can keep their jobs.
</P>
<P>
With the Basic Law and the Central Government's thoughtfulness,
the majority of the Macao-born Portuguese are no longer worried
about their future after the handover. As a matter of fact, some
Macao-born Portuguese who have left are thinking of coming back,
she said.
</P>
<P>
Macao-born Portuguese have served as a bridge linking the Macao
Government with the Macao people, they will surely play a special
role in China's relations with Portugal and Europe after Macao's
return to the motherland, she noted.
</P>
<P>
Just as the out-going Macao Governor Vasco Rocha Vieira puts it
Macao-born Portuguese are "indispensable" for Macao.
</P>
<P>
These days, 200 Macao-born Portuguese are practicing Portuguese
folk dance as part of their celebrations for the handover.
</P>
<P>
"These dancers can represent all the Macao-born Portuguese.
Since we have been part of this great family of Macao, we don't
want to be onlookers in the celebration activities," said Jose
Maria Pereia Coutinho, an official with the Economic Services of
the Macao Government.

Ambassador to Zambia Reda Bebars said the conference under the
theme "COMESA 2000: the Emerging Market" aims to increase
awareness of the international business community on COMESA as an
emerging economic bloc that has a stable predictable trade and
investment regime.
</P>
<P>
The conference, which is also aimed at attracting both domestic
and foreign investment, is expected to contribute toward the
realization of the COMESA Free Trade Area due to start on October
31, 2000, Bebars said.
</P>
<P>
"It will contribute to the identification and promotion of
investment opportunities in the COMESA region as well as enhance
intra-COMESA trade and economic relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, an Egyptian delegation led by Bebars
is currently in Zambia making consultations with the Zambian
government and the COMESA secretariat on the conference to be held
on February 28 and 29 in Cairo.

<HEADLINE> 7,000-Year-Old Pit Houses Found in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists have
discovered a pit house in north China's Shanxi Province believed
to be occupied by people 7,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
 Cultural relics taken from the pit house proved to be highly
valuable for the study of human beings in the Yellow River reaches,
the archaeologists said.
</P>
<P>
 The pit house is located in Zaoyuan Village, Yicheng County
of Shanxi, where archaeologists have been carrying out excavation
work in a 250-square-meter area for a month.
</P>
<P>
 The archaeologists said the pit house, known as the Zaoyuan
Remains, contains a large quantity of exquisite cultural relics,
including millstones, stone axes, stone shovels, pots, clay bowls,
small-mouth kettles and other tools for daily life and production.
The items could have been made in fires as hot as 900 degrees
Celsius.
</P>
<P>
In Zaoyuan, the experts have also discovered traces of fire,
including niches for illumination and half-burned branches.
</P>
<P>
The pit house is the oldest Neolithic remains archaeologists
have ever discovered in the province, some 1,000 years earlier
than previous finds.
</P>
<P>
The discovery is significant as it provides clues to help
trace the origin of the world-famous Yizhou pottery, and has
successfully resolved disputes by academicians over the
relationship between the Banpo Culture and Miaodigou Culture, the
archaeologists said.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Secretariat Announces Y2K Compliant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The secretariat of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) announced its Y2K
compliance, the secretariat said in its statement here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The completion of all the necessary measures and upgrades in
its computer system means that the performance of the ASEAN
Secretariat involving computers and information technology will
not be affected by the so-call millennium bug arising from the
onset of the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Y2K refers to problems computerized systems will face at the
turn of the century, when their two-digit-year counters fail to
distinguish between 1900 and 2000.
</P>
<P>
The glitch may cause computers to shut down or fail to function
properly. Power supplies may drop, telephones and transportation
systems may stop operation and automated banking transactions may
fail.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the ASEAN Standing Committee had
allocated an adequate amount for the secretariat to upgrade its
computers and acquire new ones, so that the secretariat's computer
system and processes involving information technology are Y2K-
compliant.
</P>
<P>
At their recent summit in Manila, the Philippines, ASEAN's
leaders called on the secretariat to raise its level of
information technology and increases its use.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia,
Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Key Rebel Leaders to Be Relocated </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Eight of the 24 key commanders
of the Lord's Resistance Army (LRA), a key rebel group reportedly
fighting the Ugandan government from southern Sudan, will be
relocated later this month from Sudan to countries of their
choices.
</P>
<P>
This will be conducted under the agreement reached between
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni and his Sudanese counterpart
Omar al-Bashir in Kenya's capital Nairobi on December 8,
Thursday's New Vision daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Those to be relocated include LRA's top commander Joseph Kony
and other high-ranking officers. They have reportedly been
separated from their fighters and captives in camps south of Juba
city in southern Sudan, the report said.
</P>
<P>
At least 200 captives in Sudan, many of them girls, will be the
first batch to be brought back to Uganda, the report said, adding
the return work will be arranged in phases.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the two presidents have also agreed not to
harbor, sponsor or give military or logistical support to any
rebel groups, opposition groups or hostile elements from each
other's territories.
</P>
<P>
They resolved to disband and disarm terrorist groups and to
prevent any acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Some of the LRA rebels who have surrendered to the government
will either be absorbed into the government army or sent to
schools, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The LRA rebels have been fighting the Ugandan government since
the ruling National Resistance Movement came to power in 1986.
More than 10,000 people have been abducted since then.
</P>
<P>
Besides the bilateral agreement reached between Uganda and
Sudan, Uganda Parliament passed a long-awaited Amnesty Bill on
December 7, granting blanket amnesty to rebels who have been
fighting to topple Museveni's government since 1986.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing Municipality in
southwest China will strengthen economic cooperation with Macao, a
senior official from the municipal foreign trade and economic
committee told Xinhua recently.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing will introduce advanced management method in finance
and tourism sectors from Macao after China enters the World Trade
Organization (WTO), said Wang Jiguang, deputy director of the
committee.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing has established trade ties with Macao in the 1980s.
As the country's largest textile production base in southwest
China, Chongqing supplied large sums of textile raw materials to
Macao.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of the 1990s, economic and trade relations
between the two sides have developed rapidly.
</P>
<P>
By the end of September, Chongqing had approved 29 Macao-funded
enterprises, with contractual investment totaling 41.67 million U.
S. dollars. These projects cover real estate, recreation and
hardware sectors.
</P>
<P>
Last April, China, Portugal and Macao signed an agreement for
the construction of a bridge on the Jialingjiang river. The work,
which will involve an investment of 80 million U.S. dollars,
started today.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Kenya has been back on track
toward its economic recovery in the last four months, Kenya's top
civil servant has said.
</P>
<P>
The international Monetary Fund (IMF) could reopen talks with
Kenya next month and after that "a major announcement" would be
made, the Kenya Times daily Thursday quoted Head of Civil Service
Richard Leakey as saying here.
</P>
<P>
Leakey expressed his optimism Wednesday about the resumption of
the 205 million U.S. dollars loan halted in July 1997 by the IMF
in protest against Kenya's poor governance, which has triggered an
economic downturn in the east African country.
</P>
<P>
Leaky was named as the country's top public servant in July
this year by President Daniel arap Moi as part of the economic
recovery strategy, which also ushered other technocrats into the
government.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the recovery strategy is progressing well
with the achievements in curbing corruption and improving
efficiency in the government, Leaky said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the government will continue its commitment
to streamlining civil service and fighting corruption.

<HEADLINE> EU Ban of Ugandan Fish to Stay for Half Year: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) ban on
 importation of Ugandan fish and fish products, initiated in April
this year, would stay for another half year unless the
international standards required by the EU are met, a senior U.N.
official has said.
</P>
<P>
The fish products in Uganda still have some deficiencies, an
official with the United Nations Industry, Development
Organization was quoted by Thursday's New Vision newspaper as
saying at a workshop.
</P>
<P>
Fish export has been the third largest foreign exchange earner
for Uganda after coffee and tourism. The EU is Uganda's biggest
fish market and its ban has made Uganda lose nearly one million
U.S. dollars each week.
</P>
<P>
Two teams from the European bloc have come to Uganda to inspect
the fishing and landing sites since the ban began, to the
conclusion that their sanitation standards are not met.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government
would soon give a general abolition and amnesty to all political
detainees nationwide, a senior official said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"We will do so in a couple of weeks. Before the end of the year,
we expect it (the awarding of abolition and amnesty) will be
completed," Minister of Law and Legislation Yusril Ihza Mahendra
told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that his side now had been collecting a comprehensive
data and making list of all political prisoners across the country.
</P>
<P>
"We have been collecting and listing those that will be given
abolition and amnesty," he added.
</P>
<P>
"This is a sensitive matter as it can trigger jealousy from
other prisoners (out of political detainees). We have to pay our
attention on this. You know other prisoners will demand (abolition
and amnesty) too," he said.
</P>
<P>
On December 10, the government had released 91 political
detainees nationwide including East Timorese and the People
Democratic Party (PRD) activists who were sent into prison by the
former president Soeharto regime.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid had also agreed on Wednesday to
endorse the House of Representative's recommendation on the

<HEADLINE> Snoring in Pregnancy Poses Risk to Baby: Researchers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Snoring in pregnancy may
indicate the mother's blood pressure is up and the baby at risk,
AAP said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
A study at Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital (RPAH) sleep
unit showed women with interrupted breathing due to snoring had
raised blood pressure at night, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
High blood pressure could massively constrict blood flow from
the placenta to the baby, and put the mother at risk of stroke or
heart attack, it said.
</P>
<P>
AAP quoted Research Fellow Dr. Natalie Edwards as saying a
fetus deprived of oxygen because the mother's breathing stops -
known as sleep apnoea - may have retarded growth.
</P>
<P>
"In our study we found women were snoring and although not
having apnoea, there was air flow limitation," she said.
</P>
<P>
"Their oxygen doesn't go down but their carbon dioxide
increases a little bit, and we think that is what is causing their
blood pressure to go up during the night," she said.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Edwards said partners should alert pregnant women to bad
snoring.
</P>
<P>
The study, due to be published in the American Journal of
Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, has already sparked
international interest, with offers of collaborative research
coming from France and the United States.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Power Rationing to Last Until Next June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The power rationing since
September in Kenya may last until next June due to shortages of
water at hydro-power stations, Kenya Power and Lighting Company
has predicted.
</P>
<P>
With the current short rain season fading, the rising of water
levels in power plants has become unlikely, the company's Managing
Director Samuel Gichuru was quoted by Thursday's East African
Standard as saying.
</P>
<P>
The short rains appeared to have come to an end by
mid-December, the only option is to wait for the start of the long
rains in March or early April, Gichuru said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, Kenyan Energy Minister Francis Masakhalia
ruled out the possibility of importing an emergency electricity
generator to ease the rationing, citing that it is too expensive
and would affect Kenya's financial situation negatively.
</P>
<P>
The power rationing in the east African country has badly
disrupted the industrial sector and caused inconvenience in the
daily life of the residents. It is also discouraging the potential
inflow of foreign investment.

<HEADLINE> Stanford Experts: Cox Committee Conclusions "Unwarranted" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Five experts from Stanford
University Wednesday said in a critique that the congressional
report on alleged Chinese espionage contained "inflammatory"
language, "unwarranted" conclusions and tarred all Chinese
visitors to the United States as potential spies.
</P>
<P>
The 99-page critique, edited by Michael M. May, of the Stanford
Center for International Security and Cooperation, charges that
the report of the special congressional committee headed by Rep.
Christopher Cox, R-Newport Beach, failed to back up what it calls
"a number of spectacular accusations" against China and several U.
S. research facilities.
</P>
<P>
The Cox committee had charged that for two decades China was
engaged in "aggressive espionage" and exploited lax U.S. security
to steal classified information on the most advanced U.S. nuclear
weapons to improve its own missile technology targeting U.S.
cities.
</P>
<P>
"Some important and relevant facts are wrong and a number of
conclusions are, in our view, unwarranted," May wrote in the
introduction of the critique.
</P>
<P>
May said there's a conflict between "the two presumed purposes
of the Cox report." On one hand, the report tries to portray China
as technologically backward, to explain why it would need to steal
U.S. nuclear secrets. On the other hand, it stresses the imminent
threat to the United States by making China appear to be a world
power with a modern nuclear capability.
</P>
<P>
"They (Cox Committee) are getting only half the story," said
Marco DiCapua, a former counselor for science and technology
affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. "Our report is a companion.
They both should be on the shelves of policy-makers and decision
makers and scholars, side by side."
</P>
<P>
The other three experts who are involved in the critique are
Alastair Iain Johnston, a Harvard professor who is a visiting
scholar at Stanford; Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky, former director of
the Stanford High Energy Physics Laboratory; and Lewis R. Franklin,
a career intelligence expert on Chinese and Russian missile and
space research.
</P>
<P>
The Stanford authors also point to numerous factual errors in
the Cox report.
</P>
<P>
For example, the report seems to confuse kilometers for miles
in giving the range of China's JL-2 ballistic missile -- saying
the range is 7,500 miles, when in fact it is 7,800 kilometers, or
approximately 4,871 miles. The difference is crucial because the
extra range would mean the missile could target all of the United
States, as the Cox report claims, rather than only parts of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
The critique also takes the Cox committee to task for often
citing allegations as fact.
</P>
<P>
"They make the blanket accusation that the Chinese have stolen
information on the entire U.S. nuclear stockpile, but they present
no evidence of it," said Wolfgang K.H. Panofsky, one of the
authors and director emeritus of the Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center. Panofsky has been one of the most outspoken critics of the
Cox committee report.
</P>
<P>
The Stanford physicist writes that the Cox report fails to
present evidence that the nuclear design information supposedly
gained through Chinese espionage could have been obtained from
public sources or developed by the Chinese on their own without
the aid of U.S. information
</P>
<P>
The Cox report followed allegations that nuclear physicist Wen
Ho Lee illegally downloaded a vast quantity of secret data from
computers at Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The
charges cast a spotlight on alleged security lapses at U.S.
weapons laboratories.
</P>
<P>
The Stanford experts said the Cox report alleged that
essentially all Chinese visitors to the United States are
potential spies. "This has cast a cloud of suspicion over both
foreign and Asian-born U.S. staff members of U.S. companies."
</P>
<P>
The Stanford report, available on the World Wide Web (www.
stanford.edu/group/CISAC), said the experts felt the Cox Committee
report made a number of "spectacular" accusations against China
and its language, particularly in its overview, was "inflammatory.
"
</P>
<P>
"I think it got some things out of proportion that were quite
important to get straight. Without some perspective it could lead
to bad effects," May said.

<HEADLINE> Panamanian Vessel Sinks In South China Sea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A cargo ship from Panama sank
in the South China Sea at 10:10 am (Beijing Time) today, but the
crew of 17 sailors have all been rescued, according to the China
Maritime Search and Rescue Center.
</P>
<P>
The 3000-ton vessel, named "Violet Ocean," was enroute from
Papua New Guinea to Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong
province, carrying 3000 tons of logs, said Zhai Jiugang, an
official with the China Maritime Security Administration(CMSA).
</P>
<P>
It encountered strong gales and high waves at 1:50 am (Beijing
Time) at a spot 40 nautical miles southeast of Shantou, another
port of Guangdong province, and began to sink.
</P>
<P>
The CMSA sent rescuers immediately after receiving a distress
call from the ship. Ships and a naval frigate were dispatched to
the scene, and CMSA also ordered the local coastal radio station
to maintain contact with the vessel as well as to inform fishing
boats nearby to give a hand.
</P>
<P>
"Allowing for the possibility that the logs on board would
probably separate from the ship and affect the local navigation
after the ship sank, we also warned ships nearby to remain on the
alert," Zhai said.
</P>
<P>
At 8:45 am this morning, the "Yin Xing" ship of the China
Shipping Group, which first reached the spot, succeeded in saving
the 17 South Korean sailors after nearly five hours.
</P>
<P>
Zhai said that the cause of the accident is still under
investigation, but he speculated that the rocky sea conditions
caused the ship to sink.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Could Double University Enrollment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital of Beijing
could double its university student enrollment in the next three
to five years, educators said here today.
</P>
<P>
The experts from various educational institutions and
government departments noted in a study report that the city has
the potential to expand its university enrollment from the present
480,000 to 900,000 students.
</P>
<P>
Beijing is the country's largest higher education center, with
68 colleges and universities and a total of 250,000 students.
</P>
<P>
The city also has 73 colleges and universities for adult
education with a total of 227,000 students.
</P>
<P>
Post-graduate students studying in Beijing account for one-
fifth of the country's total, and Ph.D. candidates for one-third
of the total.
</P>
<P>
The city also boasts a legion of first-class university
teachers.
</P>
<P>
Despite these advantages, the educational potential of the city
has not been fully tapped, the educators noted.
</P>
<P>
For instance, the student-teacher ratio at Beijing universities
stands at an averages of 10 to one, while at most foreign
universities, the rate is 20 to one.
</P>
<P>
This situation makes it possible for the city to double its
university enrollment within the next three to five years, the
experts said.

<HEADLINE> Seminar on Cross-Straits Economy and Trade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The increasing economic
cooperation between the mainland and Taiwan in recent years will
benefit the future growth of both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to experts attending an ongoing seminar on future
cross-straits economic development held in this capital of east
China's Zhejiang Province, the continuous investment from Taiwan
in the mainland ranks second after Hong Kong, and leads the United
States and Japan.
</P>
<P>
The accumulative total cross-straits trade value stood at 136.9
billion US dollars by the end of last year. In 1998, the trade
value between the two sides reached 20.5 billion US dollars, 3.87
billion in imports from the mainland to Taiwan and 16.6 billion
from Taiwan to the mainland, said the experts.
</P>
<P>
Over the past ten years, Taiwan business people have set up 41,
000 joint-ventures in the mainland with a total investment of 42
billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The economists from a dozen of research institutes and
universities in Taiwan and the mainland noted that the potential
market and favorable policies in the mainland are attractive to
Taiwan investors.
</P>
<P>
They urged for the direct exchange of postal services, trade,
and air and shipping services across the Taiwan Straits. The
exchange will help both sides maintain economic vitality and
develop future prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Zhuhai Improves Water Supply Facilities to Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Zhuhai, the nearest interior
city to Macao, has been working to improve facilities capable of
supplying water to Macao year-round.
</P>
<P>
According to Tang Lihua, manager of the Zhuhai Water Supply
Company, which is in charge to providing drinking water to Macao,
the company now operates three networks that help send 150,000
cubic meters of fresh water from Zhuhai to Macao daily.
</P>
<P>
But owing to the natural conditions in the locality, every
October through March the fresh-water supply from Zhuhai to Macao
is adversely affected when seawater flows into the fresh-water
source.
</P>
<P>
To cope with the dilemma during that period, Tang's company has
built a water diversion system that will relocate the present
water-drawing position 40 km away to avoid the negative impact of
the refluent seawater.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, construction of another new pumping station is
underway at a cost of 280 million yuan (33.7 million US dollars).
When the station is finished, 1.3 million cu m of fresh water will
be pumped daily.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, a third water supply project will also be
built by installing a water pipeline connecting Zhuxiandong
Reservoir of Zhuhai to Qingzhou Water Plant of Macao. The project
is expected to be completed in two years, according to Tang.

<HEADLINE> Potted Lotus to Blossom for Macao's Return Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHUHAI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 off-season potted
lotus carefully cultivated by local horticulturists here have been
presented to Macao as gifts.
</P>
<P>
The potted lotus, which will be placed on the streets and
alleys of Macao, will blossom on December 20 when the city
returns to China, according to Dr. Cheng Ping of the Zhuhai
Agricultural Science Center.
</P>
<P>
Cheng, who led the cultivation of the plants, spent months
making repeated experiments with more than 130 lotus varieties
brought in from Wuhan and Beijing, along with a dozen other
researchers, and achieved success on November 21 when the first
lotus blossomed.
</P>
<P>
In the following days, 67 potted lotus of many varieties
blossomed. A panel of horticulture experts from Guangdong
Province believe that the cultivating technology used to breed the
off-season potted lotus meets international standards.
</P>
<P>
The lotus, which blossoms usually in summer, has been chosen as
the regional flower of the Macao Special Administrative Region.

ZHENGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists
recently confirmed that a pottery workshop previously excavated in
Jiaozuo in Henan Province, central China, was built during the
early Warring States Period (475-221 B.C.).
</P>
<P>
Along with the workshop, some ten tombs of the Han Dynasty (206
B.C.- A.D. 220) were also discovered at a construction site near
the building.
</P>
<P>
Many gray-colored clay containers of various shapes and designs
were unearthed in the workshop, and among them archeologists found
a square-shaped seal with the words "pottery workshop" in Chinese
on the handle of one container.
</P>
<P>
Local experts say this find provides more significant

<HEADLINE> Low-Cost Housing Popular in Northeast China City </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Economy housing has become
increasingly popular in the port city of Dalian in northeast China
's Liaoning Province since the government did away with the
decades-old welfare housing distribution system last year.
</P>
<P>
Although the price per square meter of space in some
residential communities has increased to 3,200 yuan (385 US
dollars ) this year from 2,500 to 2,800 yuan (300-337 US dollars)
last year, the supply of affordable housing still does not meet
demand, according to one estate agent.
</P>
<P>
In other residential communities, the average price per square
meter is 2,500 yuan (300 US dollars), attracting hundreds of
buyers.
</P>
<P>
Analysts attribute the booming business in affordable housing
to their relatively lower prices, good quality of construction,
and efficient design.
</P>
<P>
The great improvement in living conditions for the local
residents of Dalian contributes significantly to the hot market,
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, they noted, real estate markets nationwide still
remain sluggish because of inadequate demand.

<HEADLINE> hke121618 - Roundup: Bangladesh Experiences Continued Political Confrontation in 1999 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh witnessed continued
political confrontation in the year 1999, with the opposition so
far having called 18 countrywide hartals (destructive strikes),
demanding immediate resignation of the government and snap
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the Jatiya Party, the
Jamaat-e-Islami and the Islami Oikya Jote (Islamic Solidarity
Front) - four opposition parties which are all represented in the
parliament - formed an anti-government alliance early this year,
in an effort to intensify their oust-government movement.
</P>
<P>
The alliance first boycotted municipal elections in late
February by staging nationwide shutdowns to press home their four-
point demands which included the resignation of the chief election
commissioner, reorganization of the Election Commission, issuance
of voters' identity cards before the elections and release of all
political prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said they would not take part in any
elections under the present chief election commissioner, and vowed
to resist any polls thereafter without the participation of the
opposition parties.
</P>
<P>
"We will not take part in any election under the incumbent
chief election commissioner and we seek parliamentary elections
first under a caretaker administration," BNP Secretary General
Abdul Mannan Bhuiyan once told a leading weekly newspaper here.
</P>
<P>
The opposition also went on an unofficial boycott of parliament
this year, on such pretexts as to protest the government's
decision in late July to examine the proposal of providing road
transshipment facilities to India, the government's unilateral
decision to hold city corporation polls, and opposition law-makers
being deprived the right time to speak in parliament.
</P>
<P>
In the opposition camp, the Jatiya Party, the third largest
party in the country, experienced a split early this year when
party chief H.M. Ershad withdrew support to the Awami League (AL)-
led "government of national consensus" and joined forces with
other opposition parties to oppose the government while his party
general secretary refused to quit as a cabinet minister.
</P>
<P>
And the AL also encountered a crisis when party leader Abdul
Siddiqui staged a rebellion against the leadership of AL President
Sheik Hasina, who is also the incumbent prime minister, by making
public speeches and statements criticizing the government and
demanding an account of the assets and property of the prime
minister, her relatives and the cabinet members.
</P>
<P>
Siddiqui, who was consequently expelled in late July from the
party on charges of breaking party discipline and indulging in
anti-organizational activities, has hinted that he would float a
new party within this month which might include some ruling party
leaders.
</P>
<P>
Evidence showed that Siddiqui would probably join the anti-
government movement of the opposition alliance sooner or later,
political analysts here said.
</P>
<P>
The climax of the anti-government movement came in late
November when chiefs of the four parties of the opposition
alliance sat together, the first summit of the nearly-one-year
alliance, vowing to oust the government and forming a patriotic
and strong government on a "broad-based unity."
</P>
<P>
The analysts said the summit and its declaration showed that
the four parties have finally agreed on a same platform in their
joint movement to oust the government, and that the four parties
must have reached consensus on how to contest the next
parliamentary elections, jointly or separately and how to share
power if their movement is successful.
</P>
<P>
Many people had hoped that the anti-government movement would
come into a recess during the month of Ramadan beginning December
10 after a countrywide strike early this month following the much-
talked-about summit.
</P>
<P>
The hope was smashed, however, when the Election Commission's
announcement on December 7 of polls to the city corporation in
Chittagong, southeast Bangladesh, early next month and the
opposition's subsequent nationwide shutdown on December 13 and a
two-day strike in the seaport city on December 13-14.
</P>
<P>
Hasina repeatedly urged to opposition to "shun the path of
hartal" and "come to dialog" this year, a proposal the
opposition has rejected, arguing that the ruling party was not
sincere as the AL even did not bother to make it written and
formal.
</P>
<P>
The possibility of reconciliation between the ruling and the
opposition parties was very thin for the time being considering
the political atmosphere in the country, the analysts said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the political situation in the South Asian
nation is most likely to remain uncertain next year, but one thing
is certain: the opposition alliance will organize more programs,
such as strikes and rallies, to unseat the three-and-half-year-old
government and to prepare for the next general elections.

<P>
The trade and economic relationship between Hong Kong and Macao
will be enhanced after the change of sovereignty, he said, adding
that there are good prospects for economic development in the
south China region.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt both Hong Kong and Macao will make good use of these
economic opportunities," Tsang concluded.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung said that in the past two and
half years, the legal system of Hong Kong has been tested by winds
and rain, but it has made headway.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the experience makes me more confident about the
success of 'One Country, Two Systems'", she said, adding that it
has demonstrated the wisdom of the Chinese in resolving problems
left over by history.
</P>
<P>
After the return, Hong Kong has a constitutional order, but it
has also preserved the previous common law system, she said,
adding that it forms the skeleton of Hong Kong's legal system.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances
and customary law form the fabric of this legal system and they
are not in conflict with each other, she added. "In fact they
certainly can mix together well," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that through actual practice over the past two years
and more, the great concept of "One Country, Two Systems" has been
realized in Hong Kong. "And I firmly believe that this concept can
likewise be implemented in Macao," Leung stressed.

SEOUL, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A ferry route linking Sokcho
city on the eastern coast of South Korea and Hunchun city of China
via the Russian Far East is expected to open in March.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries said Thursday
that it has granted a license to a South Korean-Chinese joint
venture to operate the ferry service on the condition that it
launches a car ferry service and sets up a passenger terminal in
Sokcho.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed to provide a car ferry service on the
Sokcho-Hunchun route in 1993. The joint venture was allowed to go
ahead with the project by the government of the Russian Far East
in June.
</P>
<P>
The new route is expected to stimulate economic exchanges
between South Korea, the three northeastern provinces of China and
the Russian Far East, said a ministry spokesman.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Australia Seen Shifting its Regional Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- At the end of the 20th
century, Australia is witnessed a significant policy shift by
waving away its 25-year regional strategy to drift from Asia.
</P>
<P>
During the 1998s when the Asian economies were going up, the
former Australian governments decided to merge Australia into Asia.
They pursued the target with active diplomatic measures. The
country took an active part in the Cambodian peace process and
proposed to set up the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum
APED and held a goodwill stance toward the closest and strongest
neighbor Indonesia and signed a bilateral security treaty with
Indonesia in 1995.
</P>
<P>
At home, the then Hawke and Keating governments started a great
project to produce a multicultural community to water down its
white color. Meanwhile they opened the door to Asian immigrants
and paid more attention to the Asian culture.
</P>
<P>
In 1999, however, all these have been derided and abandoned by
the Howard government. Prime Minister John Howard said the Keating
government was like a beggar boy with his nose pressed at the
window of the rich man's club of Asia and was not aware Australia
itself was something the Asian countries were eager to enter into.
</P>
<P>
It has been noticed that Prime Minister John Howard rarely
brings the word of "multiculture" up to his lips. His government
handles Asian illegal immigrants in such a way as if it were faced
with a disaster. Arrival of every boat of illegal Asian immigrants
would touch off a series of outcries, saying the country was
getting submerged by the Asian immigrant flood.
</P>
<P>
However, official statistics show that the first biggest part
of the illegal immigrants into Australia come by air from Britain
and the second biggest part from the United States. But nobody has
ever mentioned them nor has the government sent them to detainment
centers, merely because they are white and do not threaten
Australia's white characteristic.
</P>
<P>
The country's European characteristic is a topic stressed
repeatedly by Prime Minister John Howard. His latest mention of it
was on September 17 when he said that "we're the only nation that
really brings to Asia that combination of European history and
heritage, American association and Asian geography."
</P>
<P>
He sees the link with the motherland Britain as valuable as his
life, and desperately struggled against a republic choice in the
November referendum because a republic means cessation of the
critical links with Britain. In order to spotlight the European
background, Howard will head a big group of politicians to London
next July to have an audience with the Queen and celebrate the
Australian Federation's centenary.
</P>
<P>
Behind the policy change there has been a wind change. After
the Cold War, the West has taken a more aggressive attitude in
exporting and imposing its value and system. In the region, the
South-East Asian countries have been stricken by an economic
crisis since 1997 while the Australian economy is expanding
steadily into its 9th successive year. The daily Age claimed on
October 20 that "the economies of Australia and New Zealand have
to be taken seriously in the region, because their combined gross
domestic product is about the same as that of all the South-East
Asian economies together."
</P>
<P>
Sixteen years ago, the then Australian Prime Minister Bob Hawke
said that "our own future is now more dependent on our neighboring
countries than they will be on us." But now many Australians
believe the situation got reversed and Asian countries need
Australia more than the latter needs them.
</P>
<P>
There is an increasing evidence that Australians are turning
away from Asia. For instance, the number of young people enrolling
in Asian studies courses are declining. Books on Asian subjects
are harder to publish and sell less well.
</P>
<P>
It was against this background that Howard Doctrine was
fermented. The core of the doctrine has been reported as
increasing military expenditure to act "in a sort of deputy
peacekeeping capacity in our region to the global policeman role
in the United States." Faced with sharp criticism from neighboring
countries, Howard denied he had used the word "deputy." Then, the
new policy was described as "phantom doctrine."
</P>
<P>
The doctrine was finally repudiated while the phantom keeps
clouding over the hearts and minds of the South-East Asian nations,
especially Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On November 15 this year, authorized by the United Nations,
Australia led a multi-national troop into East Timor. Talking
about this, Prime Minister Howard announced officially that "we're
not big enough to be a policeman anywhere but we are big enough
and economically strong enough to play a constructive, positive
leadership role in an area like this and on an issue such as this.
"
</P>
<P>
Now the problem is whether the South-East Asian countries
welcome a leader from the West. So far, they are highly sensitive
on their sovereignty and have long stuck to a non-interventionist
policy in each other's affairs even within themselves. To any
Western motives, they are keeping more vigilance especially after
the economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's Deputy Prime Minister Abdullay Badawi reportedly
declared in November that "We did not appoint them (Australians).
We don't wish to see any nation which sees itself as keeper or
leader or commander in the region."
</P>
<P>
Indonesia turned its back on Australia. The relationship
between the two reached its lowest point since 1960s. On November
16 this year, the next day that the Australian-led multinational
troop poured into East Timor, Indonesia canceled the bilateral
security treaty signed with Australia in 1995. Recently,
Indonesian new President Abdurrahman Wahid said he did not care if
the relationship would worsen.
</P>
<P>
Australia wants to lead the region but the Asian countries
refuse any leadership from the West. It is a contradiction that
will lead the political ties of Australia with its neighbors into
a new round of convulsions of fear and distrust, though economic
cooperation between them seems to be continuing.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Likely to Face Prolonged, Cold Winter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is likely to
experience severe and prolonged cold during this winter, The
Bangladesh Observer reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Weather experts in Dhaka were quoted as predicting that the
biting cold wind would begin sweeping the northern region of the
country by early next week, and dense fog may cover up many of the
coastal areas of the country with the approach of the jet wind.
</P>
<P>
The entire country will gradually come under the intensive grip
of the cold wind within late December, and the wind is likely to
become more intensified from the first week of January that may
continue until mid-February.
</P>
<P>
Officials predicted that the country may experience record-low
temperature this year because of unusual dry atmosphere coupled
with extremely poor presence of moisture in the soil, caused from
abrupt fall of sub-soil water level in different regions of the
country.
</P>
<P>
The intensity of cold was remarkably less during the last
winter because of what scientists said availability of more than
enough moisture in the soil that came from the devastating flood
last year.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Director of the Meteorological Office Mohammad Akram
Hossain said the winter this year had arrived a little behind the
schedule due to unusual presence of "easterly warm wave."

<HEADLINE> South Korean Bank Gives Loan for Reactor Construction in DPRK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Export-Import Bank of Korea
has agreed to supply a loan of 3.22 billion U.S. dollars to the
Korea Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) for the
construction of light-water reactors in the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK), the bank said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the loan will be earmarked for the
construction of two light-water nuclear reactors, which the United
States, South Korea and Japan have agreed on to ease tensions on
the Korean Peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The loan will be extended on an interest-free basis, while the
principal should be repaid in six-month installments over 20 years,
including a three-year grace period, after the completion of two
reactors, said the bank.
</P>
<P>
The United States and the DPRK signed an agreement in Geneva in
October 1994 to build the reactors in return for Pyongyang's
abandonment of its alleged nuclear development.
</P>
<P>
The two light-water reactors with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts
each will be built in Kumho, an eastern coastal area of the DPRK's
Hamyong Province, at a cost of 4.6 billion U.S. dollars, of which
South Korea will provide 3.22 billion U.S. dollars, Japan one
billion and the United States the rest.
</P>
<P>
The South Korean Electric Power Corp. will construct the
reactors and install and manage fundamental facilities while the
KEDO will be responsible for supplying a work site, communication
facilities and securing workers' safety.

<HEADLINE> Macao's Return Great Contribution to Peace: Maltese President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Maltese President Guido De Marco
Wednesday congratulated China on Macao's return and praised the
event as a great contribution to world peace, reports from
Valletta said.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a picture show on Macao sponsored by the Chinese
embassy in Malta, De Marco applauded Macao's return as a great
contribution to world peace, noting Chinese and Portuguese efforts
in peacefully settling the hundreds-year issue through dialogues.
</P>
<P>
The "one country, two systems" policy, initiated by the late
Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping and proved out by Hong Kong's
successful return, has become an effective solution to pending
problems left by history, said the president.
</P>
<P>
De Marco said the policy has now created a dialogue bridge for
China and Portugal to smoothly settle the Macao issue, by
guaranteeing both Macao's return to China and the continuance of
its current social system.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed Macao's return as a successful example of
China's peaceful diplomacy, which fully reflects the country's
arts of far-sighted diplomacy and pragmatic diplomatic policy.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Ambassador to Malta Zu Qinshun, who jointly presided
over the opening ceremony with De Marco, briefed the guests of the
facts about Macao's return and principles of "one country, two
systems," "Macao people governing Macao" and "a high degree of
autonomy."

The trade and economic relationship between Hong Kong and Macao
will be enhanced after the change of sovereignty over the latter,
he said, adding that there are good prospects for economic
development in the South China region.
</P>
<P>
"No doubt both Hong Kong and Macao will make good use of these
economic opportunities," Tsang concluded.
</P>
<P>
Secretary for Justice Elsie Leung said that in the past two and
a half years, the legal system of Hong Kong has been tested by
winds and rains, but it has made some headway.
</P>
<P>
"On the whole, the experience makes me more confident about the
success of 'One Country, Two Systems'", she said, adding that it
has demonstrated the wisdom of the Chinese in resolving problems
left by history.
</P>
<P>
After the reunification, Hong Kong has a constitutional order,
but it has also preserved the previous common law system, she said,
adding that it forms the skeleton of Hong Kong's legal system.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the common law, rules of equity, ordinances
and customary law form the fabric of this legal system and they
are not in conflict with each other, she added. "In fact they
certainly can mix together well," she noted.
</P>
<P>
Leung said that through actual practice over the past two-odd
years, the great concept of "One Country, Two Systems" has been
realized in Hong Kong. "And I firmly believe that this concept can
likewise be implemented in Macao," Leung stressed.

<HEADLINE> Romania's Largest Opposition: Solve Government Crisis Legally </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUCHAREST, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Romania's largest opposition
party Wednesday repeated its appeal for a legal solution to the
current government crisis caused Tuesday by President Emil
Constantinescu's order to remove Prime Minister Radu Vasile.
</P>
<P>
Ion Iliescu, chairman of the Romanian Social Democracy Party,
stressed in the appeal that the country's law gives only the
parliament, not the president, the authority to sack the prime
minister, and therefore urged the president and the ruling
coalition to "correct their error."
</P>
<P>
He told the press that the crisis can be resolved properly only
by a parliamentary vote of no-confidence on the government given
Vasile's refusal to resign. But first of all, the president should
retract his order, which is unconstitutional, he demanded.
</P>
<P>
Before all these done, he added, his party will not consider
talking with the president about any issue including a possible
new prime minister.
</P>
<P>
President Constantinescu's order has already provoked strong
reaction across the country. Most of Romania's opposition groups
and law experts have questioned its legality, though some others
hold it a pressing priority now to end the crisis and form a new
cabinet as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Vasile's dismissal was ordered early Tuesday after he refused
to resign even after the ruling Christian Democratic National
Peasant's Party and its major coalition partners withdrew their
support, and 10 cabinet ministers announced quitting in a bid to
force him out.
</P>
<P>
Vasile rejected the order, which he said is "unconstitutional,"
and later the same day, expressed the intention to remain a
senator without mentioning resignation.
</P>
<P>
President Constantinescu and the ruling coalition groups met on
Wednesday night to choose a new prime minister. As they are widely
apart on the candidates, it appears unlikely that either Interior
Minister Constantin Dudu Ionescu or the head of the state property
fund Radu Sarbu would succeed Vasile as previously expected.
</P>
<P>
At present, Mugur Isarescu, an independent and chief of the
Romanian State Bank, has seemed the most likely choice acceptable
to all.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Army to Change Signaling Equipment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean Army will
obtain 34 advanced signaling devices next year to replace old ones,
said the Defense Ministry on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The new radio sets, made by South Korean Daeyoung Electronics,
are among the 1,378 sets of signal equipment worth about 570
billion won (some 470 million U.S. dollars) that the Army plans to
procure within the next few years.
</P>
<P>
The 34 VHF sets of radios are modeled after Canada's AN/GRC-512,
which the ministry selected in May this year over a Swedish model.
</P>
<P>
LG Precision, teamed with the Swedish company which failed to
win the Defense Ministry's bid, has sent letters of complaint to
the government, claiming that Swedish Ericsson's RL-402A model was
superior to the Canadian Marconi model.
</P>
<P>
However, the ministry responded that both models have similar
capabilities and there is no problem with its selection of the
Canadian model in terms of price and capability.
</P>
<P>
The Canadian model is some four million won (some 3,300 dollars)
cheaper than the Swedish one.

<HEADLINE> New Bridge Opened in Myanmar's Rakhine State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A new bridge built on the
Yangon-Sittway highway in Myanmar's western Rakhine state was
commissioned for service Wednesday, official newspaper The New
Light of Myanmar reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The 390-meter-long Ramong bridge in the state's Minbye township
was built at a cost of 2.3 million U.S. dollars plus 1.584 billion
Kyats (5.28 million dollars), it said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the inaugural ceremony of the bridge, Lieutenant-
General Khin Nyunt, first secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and
Development Council, disclosed that over 800 small and 10 major
bridges were built on the highway alone in the state which is a
coastal area criss-crossed by rivers and streams.
</P>
<P>
Three more bridges in the state are under construction and will
soon be completed, he said.
</P>
<P>
By the time when all the bridges on the highway are completed,
people from Sittway can travel to Yangon directly by road and to
all parts of the Myanmar through a mountain pass, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also disclosed that a deep sea-port will also be built in
the state where sea fishing, fish and prawn breeding and marine
enterprises are flourishing, saying that prospects will be bright
by having this sea port to extend foreign trade and to enhance
tourism in the region.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar has built 114 bridges
including 12 major ones and 5,871 km of roads since 1988. The
total length of roads has been extended to 29,187 km in 1999 from
23,316 km in 1988.

<HEADLINE> China Listed Among World Top Ten Air Carriers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The sector of civil aviation in
China has been expanding at a pace twice the growth rate for
national economy since 1980, making China one of the world's top
ten air carriers.
</P>
<P>
This was told at an international conference on reform of China
's basis economies held recently in Haikou, capital of the island
province of Hainan in south China.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the sector had transported a total of 57.55 million
passengers and 1.4 million tons of cargoes, a rise of 16.5 percent
and 15.7 percent respectively on 1980 figures.
</P>
<P>
Air traffic has now become a vital means of transport in China.
</P>
<P>
China's civil aviation industry has now launched 1,122 air
routes, 983 of which are domestic lines, and built an air traffic
network linking 199 cities worldwide, including 64 cities in 34
foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, enterprises of the civil aviation industry in China
had registered a total of 183.44 billion yuan of assets, 80 times
the figure for 1978, the year when China introduced the reform and
opening-up policy.
</P>
<P>
At present, the industry now boasts a fleet of some 800
passenger planes, as against 50 small-sized planes in early 1950s.
</P>
<P>
There are now 143 airports available for passenger planes
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Those speedy growth are resultant from a reform to encourage
the use of local and overseas investment in the aviation industry.
</P>
<P>
During the 20-year period from 1978 to 1998, local governments'
spending on airport construction amounted to 42.9 billion yuan,
with the use of overseas loans reaching 1.23 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Anhui Seeking For Int'l Effort To Save Wetlands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, December 16 (Xinhua) -- East China's Anhui Province is
working to seek international cooperation for protecting local
wetland resources, which are shrinking in size and deteriorating,
a threat posed by varied human factors.
</P>
<P>
The Huaihe River and the Yangtze, the longest in China, flow
through Anhui province, helping form 3.8 million ha of wetlands
locally, which accounts 27.8 percent of the national total.
</P>
<P>
This means that Anhui boasts the largest area of wetlands in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Wetlands have comprehensive strong points, such as nurturing
water sources, storing floodwater, regulating climate, as well as
disposing of sewage, along with provision of a haven for wildlife,
especially endangered water fowls.
</P>
<P>
The increasing population living in valleys of the Yangtze and
Huaihe rivers in recent years, has accelerated the decrease and
worsening of the wetlands, where a renowned home for rare and
precious wildlife and plants like Chinese alligator, white dolphin,
red-crowned crane, diatom and hornwort.
</P>
<P>
Though Anhui has begun to set up nature reserves for wetlands
since 1982, it currently has only brought 4.6 percent of local
wetlands under protection, because of technology and fund
shortages.
</P>
<P>
The province intends to introduce overseas technology,
facilities and money to do such research works on wetlands
environment, waterfowl resources, and migratory birds.

<HEADLINE> Macao Press Confident in Freedom of Speech After Return </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- "Macao Forum" is a popular
hotline program at the local broadcasting station in Macao, at
which the audience may freely discuss political, economic and
social problems or even criticize the government with no need to
identify themselves.
</P>
<P>
A special focus for the program on Dec. 19 is to invite the
audience to voice their opinions on Macao's return to China and
their expectations for the government of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR).
</P>
<P>
"This is a hot topic of the Macao people today, and we hope the
audience may participate in the program and show their concerns
about Macao's future," said U Kin Tong, chief editor of the news
department at the Macao Radio Station.
</P>
<P>
"The special program also speaks out our common hope for the
SAR government to respect the freedom of press and allow such
programs as Macao Forum to continue," he said.
</P>
<P>
Macao, a peninsula at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta in
south China, is to return to China on Dec. 20 after being ruled by
the Portuguese for more than 150 years.
</P>
<P>
With regard to the relatively complete press law system in
Macao, there won't be a big problem in freedom of press, U Kin
Tong said.
</P>
<P>
Macao people are free to run newspapers and news agencies on
their own without government censorship, and all they need to
abide by is some rules such as the ban for personal attacks and
libel.
</P>
<P>
The Macao SAR Basic Law also says that all Macao residents are
entitled to enjoy freedom of speech, press and publication.
</P>
<P>
The main criterion for judging news value will continue to be
the degree of public concern for the events, so as to provide a
good variety of useful information for the public, U Kin Tong said.
</P>
<P>
His views were echoed by Lok Po, deputy editor-in-chief of the
Macao Daily News, who said that he believed that the freedom of
speech will continue in post-return Macao and the government will
continue to increase transparency in administration and support
the media.
</P>
<P>
As a newspaper with the biggest circulation in Macao, Macao
Daily News will continue to carry three commentaries every day as
a means to supervise the government. "We will continue to serve as
a bridge between the people and government by publishing the voice
of the commonplace people," Lok Po said.
</P>
<P>
To maintain its independence, Macao Daily News won't receive
government subsidies, according to Lok Po.
</P>
<P>
Victor Chan, a deputy head of the news department in Macao TV
Station, said people are entitled to have different thoughts in an
open society like Macao and the purpose of his television station
is to express these thoughts of the people.
</P>
<P>
This tradition will continue in the future with legal support
and the efforts from the press, Victor Chan predicted.
</P>
<P>
Actually, this function of the press will be further
highlighted in post-return Macao, since the residents will place
higher hopes on the SAR government and the SAR government also
needs to learn about the public opinion and expectations for the
sake of the government administration, economic development and
social security, he added.
</P>
<P>
"All the social problems in Macao can't be solved overnight,"
Victor Chan said, adding that "What we hope is to help the
government to map out long-term policies and thereby contribute to
the prosperity and development of Macao."

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Regional Flag and Emblem of Macao SAR </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The regional flag and emblem of
the Macao Special Administrative Region (SAR) are symbols and
insignias of the Macao SAR. They came into being on March 31, 1993.
</P>
<P>
The regional flag of the Macao SAR is a green flag with five
stars, lotus flower, bridge and sea water.
</P>
<P>
The five stars symbolize national unification and the fact that
Macao is an inalienable part of China. Lotus flower is a popular
local flower in Macao. In the old days, Macao was also known as
the "land of lotus" and "lotus stem." Its three petals represent
the Macao Peninsula, Taipa Island and Coloane Island. The whole
lotus flower symbolizes the prosperity of the future of Macao. The
bridge and sea water below the lotus flower reflect the natural
conditions of Macao. And the green flag symbolizes the thriving
land of China including Macao.
</P>
<P>
The regional emblem of the Macao SAR is composed of five stars,
lotus flower, bridge and sea water encircled by the words "Macao
Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China"
in Chinese and "MACAO" in Portuguese. This shows that both Chinese
and Portuguese are official languages in Macao.
</P>
<P>
The regional flag and emblem of the Macao SAR are designed to
highlight the highly autonomous status of the Macao SAR and to
provide convenience for it in communications with the outside
world. According to Article 10 of the Basic Law, apart from
displaying the national flag and emblem of the People's Republic
of China, the Macao SAR may also display and use a regional flag
and a regional emblem.
</P>
<P>
The regional flag and emblem of the Macao SAR are results of
collective wisdom and creation. The Macao SAR Basic Law Drafting
Committee collected 782 design works of the regional flag and
emblem from all over the country, including Macao. Then three sets
of design were selected from all the works. Finally, the Macao SAR
Basic Law Drafting Committee put together the merits of all design
works and put forward a new design. The design of the regional
flag and emblem were approved by the first session of the Eighth
National People's Congress (NPC) as it passed the Basic Law of the
Macao SAR on March 31, 1993.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Researchers Make Breakthrough in Extracting Hydrogen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
A research team in Anshan, a city in northeast China's Liaoning
province, claimed that they have invented equipment, which can
produce hydrogen with lower electricity use. They said the
equipment uses only 0.93 kilowatts/hour to make one cubic meter of
hydrogen gas -- believed to be the lowest figure in the world.
</P>
<P>
Before the equipment was invented, the researchers here were
using about 8 kilowatt/hour to turn out one cubic meter of
hydrogen.
</P>
<P>
However, local hydrogen producers noted that large-scale
production of hydrogen with this equipment will still be quite
costly. About 26 to 36 billion yuan (3.1 to 4.3 billion US dollars)
is needed to build a coastal plant with daily capacity of 100
million cubic gas based on this technology.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the research team was reported to have developed even
more sophisticated equipment which used only 0.0093 kilowatt/hour
to produce one cubic meter of hydrogen, but scientists said that
there are too many difficulties involved and the cost of making
such equipment and accessories is prohibitive.
</P>
<P>
Virtually pollution-free hydrogen is expected to replace other
conventional fuels in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
The research outcome is expected to be published on the
Internet shortly.

agricultural production which is the basic community level service,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at the immediate rehabilitation needs and
capacity building of displayed agricultural communities.
</P>
<P>
It will benefit about 24,000 families living in 400 villages in
the Northeast region.
</P>
<P>
It will finance rehabilitation of irrigation schemes and rural
roads, provision of drinking water and community capacity building
activities, said the reports, adding that agricultural
productivity of about 16,000 hectares will be revitalized by
restoring 400 neglected irrigation schemes.
</P>
<P>
The service capacity of the 1,200 kilometers of priority

<P>
HONG KONG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Senior leaders of the Hong
Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR) government Thursday
expressed their hope that they will seize every opportunity to
enhance cooperation with the newly-born Macao SAR government into
the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Just four days before China's resumption of sovereignty over
Macao, the Hong Kong SAR leaders said that they would like share
with the new team of Macao officials the success of the China's
first SAR established in Hong Kong in 1997 and their experience in
implementing the great concept of "One Country, Two Systems" over
the past two years.
</P>
<P>
"We welcome the reversion of sovereignty over Macao to China
and look forward to cooperating with the Macao SAR in matters of
mutual concern," Anson Chan, the SAR administrative secretary,
told Xinhua exclusively.
</P>
<P>
Chan believed that the "One Country, Two systems" concept is a
unique concept "with no precedent to guide us".
</P>
<P>
"Its success depends on the commitment of the two parties
involved, that is the sovereign power and the special
administrative region, to abide by the provisions of the Joint
Declaration and the Basic Law," Chan said.
</P>
<P>
Chan stressed that a great deal of work went into fleshing out
the principles laid down in these two documents. Since July 1,
1997, the Hong Kong SAR has enjoyed a high degree of autonomy and
the Hong Kong people are running Hong Kong under the leadership of
Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, she added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Chan noted that the Central Government has strictly
complied with the Joint Declaration and the Basic Law and has not
interfered in matters falling within the autonomy of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
"The rule of law continues to be the cornerstone of Hong Kong's
stability and prosperity, our judiciary remains independent, and
Hong Kong's way of life has not changed," Chan explained.
</P>
<P>
All the rights and freedoms including freedom of the press, of
expression and assembly guaranteed in the Joint Declaration and
the Basic Law remain intact, she said.

<P>
Speaking of Hong Kong's economic development over the past two
years, Donald Tsang Yam-kuen, financial secretary of the Hong Kong
SAR, said that the Basic Law provides a solid legal foundation for
Hong Kong's continued economic success.
</P>
<P>
The SAR is given full autonomy in economic and financial
matters, and maintains its own currency. "Indeed we are charged
with the duty under the Basic Law to maintain Hong Kong's status
as an international financial center," he told Xinhua in an
exclusive interview.
</P>
<P>
In the two years since the establishment of the SAR, Hong Kong'
s economy was seriously affected by the Asian financial crisis.
Prices are falling and unemployment rate is over 6 percent, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We experienced a painful but necessary adjustment process
during this period, with companies downsizing and rationalizing
their operations to increase competitiveness and efficiency,"
Tsang said.
</P>
<P>
Tsang stressed that entrepreneurs and the workforce have
demonstrated great resilience and endurance in this difficult
adjustment period. Reforms are implemented in the banking and
financial sectors to increase our competitiveness, he added.
</P>
<P>
"All these are now bearing fruit as the economy is recovering,
with the third quarter GDP growth at 4.5 percent and the growth
forecast for 1999 as a whole revised upward to 1.8 percent," Tsang
said.
</P>
<P>
He said, "our adherence to the principle of fiscal prudence as
enshrined in the Basic Law enables us to build up sizable reserves,
and this makes it possible for the government to finance budget
deficits in the past two years to alleviate the burden on the
public during the financial crisis."
</P>
<P>
With China's imminent accession to the World Trade Organization,
plans to spearhead local development on innovation and technology,
the agreement with Walt Disney Company to build a theme park,
there is a horizon of opportunities ahead of Hong Kong, he added.

About 130 wild cranes have made their homes at Tangduo Lake

<HEADLINE> Schroeder, Clinton Agree on Nazi Slave Labor Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, December 15 (Xinhua) -- German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder said Wednesday that he and U.S. President Bill Clinton
had agreed on a fund of 10 billion marks (4.7 billion U.S. dollars)
to compensate millions of slave laborers during Germany's Nazi era,
ending year-long negotiations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he and Clinton had agreed both on the sum and
measures to protect German firms against new legal demands for
further compensations on the issue.
</P>
<P>
The chief U.S. negotiator, Deputy Secretary of Treasury Stuart
Eizenstat, flew to Berlin on Wednesday evening in an effort to
hammer out with his German counterpart Otto Graf Lambsdorff the
details of a final German-U.S. solution that will be signed on
Friday at the G-8 Foreign Ministers' meeting here.
</P>
<P>
Lambsdorff told Berlin Info Radio that the German side would
offer 5,000 to 6,000 marks (2,630 to 3,150 dollars) as
compensation for each forced laborer and about 15,000 marks (7,840
dollars) for each slave laborer in concentration camps.
</P>
<P>
Neither Schroeder nor Lambsdorff spelled out how much the
German government would contribute to the fund.
</P>
<P>
So far, Berlin had agreed to pay three billion marks (1.57
billion dollars) and the German businesses had offered five
billion marks (2.63 billion dollars). But Finance Minister Hans
Eichel said that the German federal government had no more money
to spare and might sell part of its holdings.
</P>
<P>
"Under this condition, the federal government must sell
something from its ownership," Eichel told the ZDF television
Wednesday evening.
</P>
<P>
Schroeder said he hoped Germany's 16 state governments would
participate in the fund initiative and he planned to call a
session with the state premiers on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Wolfgang Gibowski, spokesman for the German businesses of the
fund initiative, told Deutsche Presse Agentur (DPA) news agency
that some 26 German firms, including such big names as Daimler-
Chrysler, BMW, Siemens, Hoechst and BASF, had committed themselves
to participating in the fund.
</P>
<P>
"There must be more member companies, if people expect the
German businesses to offer more than five billion marks," said
Gibowski, adding that at least 65 German companies would finally
take part in the fund.
</P>
<P>
The Nazi German dictatorship had forced over 8 million
Europeans to supplement its depleting labor force during World War
II. Hundreds of thousands of the forced laborers died of
maltreatment, and the survivors have been demanding compensation
for the terrible abuses they had suffered.
</P>
<P>
The negotiating process, starting from 1998 when lawyers suited
German firms in U.S. courts, has been focused on how to compensate
the victims, most of whom are in their 70s or 80s and are dying
off.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, December 16 (Xinhua) -- China has shut down
dozens of illicit pharmaceutical markets and revoked the licenses
of thousands of medicine producers and traders this year, a
senior official from the Supervision Department said.
</P>
<P>
 Vice-Minister of Supervision Li Zhilun said that 83 medicine
markets had been shut down in 15 provinces and regions,and another
seven have been warned to redress their irregular practices.
</P>
<P>
Authorities also seized fake or expired medicines worth 300
million yuan (about 36 million U.S. dollars) and dealt with many
cases, he said.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown has come at a time when illegal medicine
producers and traders are appearing in several places, causing
losses to consumers and posing threats to the health of patients.
</P>
<P>
Beginning this year, the central government ordered various
industrial and commercial administrations to exercise strict
checks on medicine manufacturers and salesmen. The State
Development Planning Commission lowered the prices of costly
medicines, including 24 kinds of domestic and 114 imported
medicines, by 10 and five percent, respectively.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Commission for Discipline
Inspection, said that those who take kickbacks from the sales of
medicine and fake medicine producers will face stern disciplinary
or legal punishment.

<HEADLINE> Economists Expect Continued U.S. Economic Growth in 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economic growth
that began nearly nine years ago will continue in 2000, though at
a slower pace than in the past several years, a report said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The report from the Bond Market Association said that its
Economic Advisory Committee, which is composed of noted economists
from securities firms and banks, also expects additional
tightening by the Federal Reserve during 2000, probably in March,
resulting in somewhat higher interest rates. The unemployment
rate is expected to hold at or below 1999 level through 2000, but
without any rise in inflation.
</P>
<P>
In the foreign exchange markets, the committee expects the euro
to recover from its recent weakness, climbing to 1.14 U.S. dollars
by the end of 2000. The yen is predicted to give back some of its
recent gains and end the year at 107 to the dollar.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), according to the
committee, will average a 3.9 percent growth rate in 1999. GDP
growth for 2000 is expected to decline to 3 percent, attributable,
in part, to Y2K factors in the first quarter of the year.
</P>
<P>
Consumer Price Index inflation in 1999 is forecast at 2.6
percent. For 2000, it is expected to inch down to 2.4 percent,
and the unemployment rate is anticipated to decline slightly from
4.2 percent in 1999 to 4.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Interest rates are expected to close out 2000 above the current
level, with the median forecast at 6.7 percent for the 30-year
Treasury bond.
</P>
<P>
Committee members anticipated the budget surplus will swell to
nearly 140 billion dollars by the end of 2000, up from 123 billion
dollars this year and 69 billion dollars in 1998.
</P>
<P>
In general, the report said, the committee members believe the
Fed has done a good job in conducting monetary in 1999. But some
group members said the Fed should have acted sooner to slow the
economy.

907), have been recovered and over 7,000 suspects, including 218
people from overseas, were sued to be involved in the smuggling
cases.
</P>
<P>
China's police units have been going all out in the fight
against crime, but problems still remain, as some criminal
suspects are still at large.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to beef up a nationwide drive to deal
severely with criminals, Minister of Public Security Jia Chunwang
said recently, adding that public security departments at all
levels will focus on reinforcing grassroots units and setting up a
contract system for police units in the next couple of years.

<TEXT>
<P>
Discussing the situation in Chechnya with Putin over telephone,
Lipponen, on behalf of EU, stressed the need to hammer out a
political solution to end the war, hoping that Russia would seize
the opportunity offered by the Organization of Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to open dialogue with the rebels in
order to solve the crisis in the region. Meanwhile he also
restated that the EU condemns terrorism in all forms and respects
the integrity of Russian territory.
</P>
<P>
During the discussion, the Finnish prime minister emphasized
that both the EU and Finland aim at developing cooperation with
Russia on a long-term basis and supporting the democratic
development and stability in Russia, without intending to isolate
Russia from the sphere of European cooperation.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Macao's Return Becomes Focus of Chinese Websites </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- Macao and the return of Macao to
China have become a central theme of many Chinese-language
websites.
</P>
<P>
The word "Macao" can lead an Internet buff to a big number of
Chinese-language websites as the day of Macao's return to China,
December 20, is close at hand.
</P>
<P>
With the word "Macao," the search engine of Yahoo! can locate
184 Chinese-language websites that are related to Macao. Sixteen
of them are devoted exclusively to the region's return to China.
</P>
<P>
Names of the websites include "Macao 1999," "Into Macao" and "
Come Back, Macao." The websites are either of an official or a
private type. And contents are either in simplified Chinese used
in the Chinese mainland or in unsimplified Chinese prevalent
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
From these websites, readers from around the world can not only
follow events in the runup to the December 20 handover but also
browse for local information. Electronic maps of Macao are among
downloadable items on many sites.
</P>
<P>
On a site operated by a Guangdong-based company is a forum that
encourages readers to contribute their diaries, thoughts and
photos during the handover period. The site has so far recorded
more than 40,000 hits.
</P>
<P>
Another site run by the Qingdao municipal committee of the
Chinese Communist Youth League, a contest with Macao's return to
China as the theme is going on. On the message board of the site
writes a 12-year girl from Hong Kong: "I like Macao. The
motherland will become more beautiful after Macao's return."
</P>
<P>
A 19-year-old girl, Zhang Yuhong, writes: "I look forward to
Macao's return."
</P>
<P>
A primary school teacher in Shanghai has submitted an open
letter on the site, saying that each and every student of her
school has written a letter to students in Macao and hopes that
their letters will reach their destinations.
</P>
<P>
Most Internet activities relating to Macao's return have come
from college students.
</P>
<P>
As Macao is at the threshold of a new era, the Internet is seen
as a witness of its historic moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, December 16 (Xinhua) -- A record of more than 41
million tons of cargo has been handled at ports in Shenzhen, in
south China's Guangdong Province, from January to November this
year, a big rise from around 34 million tons in the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen's cargo totals have hovered around in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
The city has reported its most brisk business in container
cargo, with the total amount hitting 1.95 million TEUs in 1998 and
growing by over 50 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Ten percent of Guangdong Province's cargo from ocean shipping

<TEXT>
<P>
MACAO, December 16 (Xinhua) -- With the increasing influx of
immigrants, Macao's labor force has exceeded 200,000, according to
a local official.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Macao's population reached 436,000 by 1998,
70 percent more than that in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The increasing population has boosted domestic demands and
provided a large number of cheap labor to local economy, the
processing and service industries in particular.
</P>
<P>
However, the high population density and relatively developed
economy, with yearly gross domestic output (GDP) reporting at
around 60 billion patacas, also make Macao face a labor shortage.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Macao began to import labor, averaging more than 9,000
a year. To date, overseas labor has made up 15 percent of the
employees in Macao. Of the imported labor, about 70 percent are
from China's inland areas while the rest from Southeast Asian
countries.
</P>
<P>
Macao's employment rate stands at 97.3 percent. Of the employed,
37.5 percent are working in service trade and 20.6 percent in
manufacturing sector.

<HEADLINE> US Congressmen Call on Samaranch to Resign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- International Olympic
Committee President Juan Antonio Samaranch was urged by US
congressmen to resign Wednesday despite his assurance that the IOC
has been cleaned up with the passing of reform measures in
Lausanne last weekend.
</P>
<P>
"I think we've cleaned the house and a fundamental reform
package has been adopted," Samaranch was quoted as saying in his
first ever appearance before a congressional panel, which was set
up to investigate the alleged corruption during the Atlanta 1996
and Salt Lake City 2002 Olympics successful bidding campaign,
according to reports.
</P>
<P>
But lawmakers expressed open doubts over whether the 50 reforms
the IOC adopted last weekend in Switzerland will be implemented
fully. And one, Rep. Joe Barto reiterated his call for Samaranch
to resign from the post he has held since 1980.
</P>
<P>
"I would like for you to announce today that you will resign,"
Barton said. "It's time for some new blood and some new leadership.
And this would be a great setting for you to be a true statesman
of sport and announce that."
</P>
<P>
Samaranch did not respond directly. Instead, the Spaniard
retraced the IOC's actions during the year since the allegations
of vote buying in the selection of Salt Lake City to host the 2002
winter games erupted.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch said many of the reforms approved by the IOC last
weekend already have been implemented, including a ban on future
visits by IOC members to cities competing to host the games. And
he assured that the rest of the reforms will be implemented before
the 2000 summer games in Sydney, Australia, are over.
</P>
<P>
Rep. Henry Waxman warned Samaranch that Congress will monitor
the IOC's enforcement of the newly enacted reforms and will take
punitive action if necessary. He specifically cited legislation he
has introduced that would bar American companies from financially
supporting the games if the IOC does not change its practices.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers also were set to ask Spaniard about about a reported
dlrs 500,000-a-year hotel suite the IOC maintains for him in
Switzerland, about his wife's acceptance of a dlrs 12,000 trip
from organizers of the Atlanta Games and about the IOC failure to
apply the new reforms to its president.
</P>
<P>
Samaranch denounced reports of the luxury hotel suite as "a
lie;" said he encouraged his wife to take the Atlanta trip and
blamed the Atlanta organizers for being overly hospitable. He
insisted there was no need for the reforms to apply to him.
</P>
<P>
Former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young and Billy Payne, who headed
the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games, acknowledged during
hearings in October that Atlanta violated IOC gift rules in
lobbying for the 1996 games.
</P>
<P>
But they denied that the gifts and favors showered on IOC
members were designed to buy their votes or corrupt the process
that led to Atlanta's selection.

<HEADLINE> Syria, Israel Hold First-Day Session of Washington Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, December 15 ( Xinhua ) -- The Syrian and Israeli
negotiation teams held about 80 minutes of talks with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright attendance at the U.S.
official guest house, Blair House, on Wednesday after an opening
ceremony at the White House.
</P>
<P>
The talks then adjourned until Thursday's 11:00 a.m. 1600 GMT
</P>
<P>
No substantive details of the talks were released because of
effective news blackout for the two days of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart told a briefing after the
Blair House meeting at 4:30 p.m. (2130 GMT) that Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq al-Shara
discussed with Albright how to move toward a peace agreement,
which Middle East experts believe could not be reached until the
settlement of the dispute over the Golan Heights, the Syrian
territory snatched by Israel during the 1967 six-day war.
</P>
<P>
"It's not surprising there are real differences at this point,
but both parties displayed a serious intent and the president
remains firm in his commitment to help them in this effort,"
Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton met with Barak and Shara first together
after the ceremony then separately.
</P>
<P>
"They're going pretty well, but it's hard going and we've got
some work to do," Clinton told reporters after his meeting with
the two team leaders.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said Clinton "laid out how he thinks we should move
forward and where we should get to at the end of the two days" and
both sides had agreed to that.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli official said Israeli and Syrian negotiators will
reconvene their meeting on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
There were no public handshakes between Barak and Shara, which
disappointed news photographers who hoped there would have been a
routine gesture of diplomatic symbolism by handshaking.
</P>
<P>
Israeli political sources said that the Syrian team had asked
no show of public handshakes at the outset of the talks. U.S.
officials said it would be inappropriate ahead of any peace deal
as Israel and Syria are still officially in a state of war.
</P>
<P>
Lockhart said that despite the lack of handshakes, the talks
were an historic step.
</P>
<P>
"The prime minister of Israel and the foreign minister of Syria
have never sat down to talk about anything, much less peace
between the two countries ... I think the statements today
recognized long-standing differences, but there was also a spirit
of reconciliation that I don't think anyone's heard before," he
said.

</P>
<P>
Sales jumped by a solid 0.5 percent in October, the largest
increase since August, while in September it fell by 0.2 percent,
the first decline since the beginning of this year.
</P>
<P>
The rise in October's sales brought the inventory-to-sales
ratio to 1.33, meaning it would take 1.33 months to exhaust
inventories at the October sales pace.
</P>
<P>
Inventories rose by 0.3 percent at wholesalers and at factories
in October, but were flat at retailers. The numbers indicate that
businesses are not hoarding goods in anticipation of the Y2K
computer changeover.
</P>
<P>
Sales were the strongest in October at wholesalers, rising 0.7
percent. They grew by 0.4 percent at factories and 0.3 percent at
retailers.
</P>
<P>
The National Association of Purchasing Management said Tuesday
it expects the industrial sector to continue strong surge and to
bring in higher revenues.

<HEADLINE> China, U.S. Agree on Compensation Relating to U.S.Bombing of Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The Government of the People's
Republic of China and the Government of the United States of
America reached an agreement on December 16, 1999 on the question
of compensation relating to the U.S. bombing of the Chinese
Embassy in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY).
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu
Bangzao here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, the U.S. Government will pay a sum
of 28 million U.S. dollars to the Chinese Government for the
property loss and damage suffered by China as a result of the U.S.
bombing of the Chinese Embassy in FRY last May.
</P>
<P>
Prior to this, the two sides, on July 30, already reached an
agreement on the question of compensation for Chinese casualties
resulting from the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in FRY.
</P>
<P>
Zhu pointed out that the bombing of the Chinese Embassy in FRY
by the U.S.-led NATO on May 8 this year caused heavy Chinese
casualties and severe loss and damage to the embassy premises and
that it was a gross violation of the universally recognized
international law and the fundamental norms governing
international relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Government promptly issued a solemn statement,
expressing its uttermost indignation and strong condemnation
against this barbarous act. It lodged the strongest protest,
demanding that the U.S.-led NATO take full responsibility for the
incident, make public apology to the Chinese Government and people
and the families of the victims, conduct a comprehensive and
thorough investigation into the incident and make public their
detailed investigation report and severely punish the perpetrators,
Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
Under the stern representations by the Chinese Government,
leaders of the United States and other NATO countries have
apologized in public to the Chinese Government and people and the
families of the victims for the bombing incident, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu emphasized that the U.S. bombing of the Chinese Embassy in
FRY constitutes a serious case of internationally wrongful act by
the United States and that the U.S. Government must shoulder state
responsibility for its act, including making rapid, full and
effective compensation to China for all the latter's loss and
damage.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Government should conduct a comprehensive and thorough
investigation into the bombing, severely punish the perpetrators
and give a satisfactory account of the incident to the Chinese
Government and people as soon as possible, Zhu stressed.

<HEADLINE> Man United Director Rules Out more Big Paydays </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Martin Edwards said Manchester
United players would be disappointed if they think Roy Keane's new
blockbusting contract will mean big pay rises for them.
</P>
<P>
United smashed their infamous wage ceiling to make Keane the
best paid player in Britain in a deal worth a reported 50,000
pounds per week.
</P>
<P>
Edwards claimed the mega deal was in the commercial interests
of the Treble winners, but he insisted it would not open the
floodgates for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
Virtually all of United's big stars like David Beckham, Ryan
Giggs and Paul Scholes are tied up under long-term agreements.
</P>
<P>
Edwards is not about to renegotiate all those contracts and
instead each case will be judged on its merits when the time comes.
</P>
<P>
"Each player who comes in, we will have to judge each case on
its merits," said the United chairman and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
"If he's a vital player for Manchester United, the board will
know how far it needs to go, but I don't think this changes a lot.
</P>
<P>
"If players think, or agents think, that this is going to open
the floodgates for everyone else, I don't think it will because we
will judge each case on its merits.
</P>
<P>
"It may be in some cases that certain players are going to be
disappointed with future negotiations, but we've got to run
Manchester United as a business and we will continue to do so," he
said.

LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- English premier league soccer
club Newcastle United are facing High Court proceedings over their
decision to move season-ticket holders to accommodate corporate
clients at St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
Solicitors have issued proceedings against the club at the High
Court in Leeds on behalf of bondholder Jane Duffy, leader of the
Save Our Seats campaign which was mounted when the club announced
plans to move up to 4,000 fans.
</P>
<P>
Duffy is seeking an injunction preventing the club from
depriving her of her current seat and a ruling that the 500 pounds
bond she purchased in 1994 entitles her to a specific seat.
</P>
<P>
Alternatively, she wants the club to accept that she could only
be moved to a seat of equal quality.
</P>
<P>
The action also demands damages for breach of contract and
misrepresentation and costs.

<HEADLINE> U.S., African Ministers Issue Seven Principles on Investment in African Energy Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, U.S., December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and African
energy ministers Wednesday issued seven principles on the
investment in Africa's energy sector, saying that they "agreed to
create or sustain a suitable environment that would allow and
encourage the development of the energy sector of their economies
to contribute to sustainable development, and to the welfare of
their people and environment."
</P>
<P>
The guidelines were contained in a Joint Statement on
Investment Principles for the Energy Sector, which was issued here
Wednesday afternoon at the end of the U.S.-Africa Energy Ministers
Conference, which began Monday.
</P>
<P>
"The Energy Ministers discussed the capital requirements
necessary to enhance the exploration and development of energy
resources and to build the energy infrastructure that will meet
Africa's expanding needs and full potential as an important
supplier to world markets and intend to create or sustain the
institutional capabilities, legal structures, appropriate energy
policies, regulatory frameworks, and national standards necessary
to promote economic development and to attract the capital and
technology required for sustainable development," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
The joint statement adopted by governments would aid the
attraction of private investment to the basic energy
infrastructure sector, help governments promote sustainable
development, and support regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
These principles include:
</P>
<P>
-- Creating or sustaining transparent, independent, and stable
regulatory and legal frameworks, based on the rule of law and
sanity of contracts. This would include: acceptance of cost-
benefit and regulatory impact analyses, internationally recognized
technical and operating standards, and effective dispute
resolution and sunset provisions for dismantlement, whenever
applicable;
</P>
<P>
-- Contributing to macro-economic policies that encourage
investment in the energy sector and allow for close collaboration
with international financial institutions. This may include the
reduction of barriers, the establishment of effective and
realistic energy price structures, and investment in human capital
and natural resources that promotes fair distribution of wealth
and empowers the people of Africa;
</P>
<P>
-- Striving for continued good governance in the energy sector,
aimed at preventing and combating corrupt practices and promoting
transparency;
</P>
<P>
-- Working to achieve an integrated regional strategy for
Africa's energy infrastructure in the 21st century;
</P>
<P>
-- Working cooperatively with the private sector and
international financial institutions in areas where privatization
or public-private partnerships could attract needed capital;
</P>
<P>
-- Promoting the rational use of resources, good corporate
citizenship and protection of the environment consistent with
economic growth;
</P>
<P>
-- Fostering understanding, cooperation, and trust between the
public and private sectors, which are paramount to the development
of efficient, environmentally friendly and flexible energy systems
and markets worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"The Energy Ministers support the implementation of these
investment principles," the joint statement said. "Periodically,
representatives of the Energy Ministers will consult bilaterally
or through regional or multilateral economic, financial and
political organizations, forums, and groupings."

<HEADLINE> U.S., African Energy Ministers Issue Joint Statement on Sustainable Energy Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, U.S., December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and African
energy ministers Wednesday afternoon issued a joint statement,
saying that they agreed to initiate a sustained cooperative effort,
through governmental leadership and participants of the private,
business and other sectors, to meet the energy needs and protect
environment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The document, entitled "the Joint Statement on Sustainable
Energy Development and Cooperation in Support of the Environment,"
was issued at the end of the three-day U.S.-African Energy
Ministers Conference, which began here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The ministers or their representatives "discussed the unique
needs of Africa, including its serious energy shortages, limited
access to exploitation and consumption of energy, and heavy
dependence on traditional energy sources, taking into account its
diversity and enormous potential," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"The Energy Ministers agree to initiate a sustained
cooperative effort, through governmental leadership and
participation of the private, business and other sectors,
including regional and sub-regional economic, intergovernmental,
multilateral, and non-governmental organizations, to support the
growth of adequate, accessible, environmentally safe and sound,
secure, and affordable energy supplies," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement broke down into four parts, namely, goals of
cooperation, targeted areas for cooperation, principles of
cooperation, and implementation.
</P>
<P>
The main goals are to make the sustainable energy development
a reality in Africa and to remove impediments to energy trade and
investment, the statement said. "Towards this ends, the Energy
Ministers are committed to continue strengthening their
cooperation in their effort to integrate their energy sector,
economic, social, and environmental policies."
</P>
<P>
Targeted areas for cooperation include regional energy
integration, rural electrification and energy supply, clean energy
sources and energy efficiency, urban air quality, and energy
resources management, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
On the principles of cooperation, the ministers "actively
support international, multilateral, regional, and bilateral
cooperation in targeted fields," and they will pursue measures to
enhance private sector participation in their energy sector
development, the statement said, adding that the ministers will
work hard with the regional groups and other relevant parties to
carry out these objectives.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- Two junior ministers were
appointed to Northern Ireland's new power-sharing executive in
Belfast on Wednesday following a heated debate, the BBC reported.
</P>
<P>
The selection of Ulster Unionist Dermot Nesbitt and Denis
Haughey from the Social Democratic and Labor Party (SDLP) followed
a day of heated exchanges in the assembly over whether the
appointments should go ahead.
</P>
<P>
The new posts were agreed upon by the assembly following calls
by both first Minister David Trimble and first deputy Miniter
Seamus Mallon.
</P>
<P>
However, there were heated exchanges regarding how these posts
would be filled.
</P>
<P>
The Democratic Unionist Party Social Development Minister Nigel
Dodds said it was a case of "jobs for the boys" during Tuesday
evening's debate.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein assemblyman Mitchel McLaughlin expressed reservations
because both of the new junior ministers would have no specific
brief and would serve as ministers without portfolio.
</P>
<P>
The assembly narrowly voted to back the decision by the first
minister and deputy first minister to appoint the two junior
ministers at Stormont, Belfast.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 49 in favor and 38 against despite opposition from
all other parties in the assembly except the Ulster Unionists and
SDLP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sinn Fein, the Political wing of the Irish
Republican Army, called on public bodies to stop flying the Union
flag.

<HEADLINE> Britain Opens First Hospital Cinema </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua)-- Britain has opened its first
hospital cinema to offer bed-ridden patients the chance to enjoy
the silver screen, the Daily Telegraph reported Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The cinema at St Thomas's Hospital, London, has places for a
seated audience of 98 plus 10 wheelchair spaces and room for six
beds.
</P>
<P>
It will show films on general release at mainstream cinemas
during matinee performances for children and evening shows for
adult patients.
</P>
<P>
At Tuesday's opening ceremony, Kate Winslet, star of the
blockbuster movie Titanic and patron of Medicinema, the charity
responsible for the hospital cinema, said, "I think it's a great
idea to enable patients to forget about their worries, aches and
pains by losing themselves in the magic of the silver screen."
</P>
<P>
Minister for film Janet Anderson said she applauded the
partnership between the health sector and the film industry.
</P>
<P>
The cinema is the result of three years' planning and has been
built in a converted part of King's College medical school at St
Thomas's and St Guy's Hospital Trust.
</P>
<P>
During the week, the building will operate as a lecture theater
for staff at the hospitals, converting to a cinema at weekends.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman for the charity said, "We don't want patients to
feel isolated from the outside world. The cinema will show up to
date films and maybe some classics too."
</P>
<P>
Plans to build a further 20 hospital cinemas around the country
are under discussion.

Putin told a meeting of the Russian Security Council, a top
advisory body, that ties with CIS countries should occupy an
absolutely dominant position in its foreign affairs as there are
hundreds of thousands of ethnic Russians and Russian-speaking
people living in those countries.
</P>
<P>
The CIS groups 12 of the 15 former Soviet republics. The three
Baltic countries -- Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania -- stayed out of
the organization, which was set up following the disintegration of
the Soviet Union in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Putin said Moscow has no plan to declare any of the CIS states
a "zone of its strategic interests," the Itar-Tass news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Instead, "it will be right if we propose strategic partnership
to any of the Commonwealth countries," he said.
</P>
<P>
Russia's ties with other CIS countries are based on the fact
that Russia, as the inheritor of the Soviet Union, commands a
natural monopolistic position in energy, transport and
communications, Putin said.
</P>
<P>
He called for the restoration of the original economic ties,
though not necessarily to the original levels.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said international events over the past
several months have indicated that former Soviet republics are "
the natural allies of Russia."
</P>
<P>
He said the goals and tasks for Russia's policies toward the
CIS countries remain unchanged, but the methods and means in
achieving those goals should be improved.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council has decided to set up an inter-
departmental group that specializes in the study of Russian
policies toward those countries, Putin said.

<HEADLINE> UK Woman to Challenge Test-tube Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- A British woman who had her
eggs frozen while she underwent cancer treatment has found she is
not legally allowed to try for a baby, the BBC reported on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Now a High Court challenge has been launched by a leading
London fertility clinic in an attempt to change the regulations.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Neill, 34, from Belfast, was told by doctors that
radiotherapy was almost certain to render her infertile, but as
she did not have a partner, she opted to store some unfertilized
eggs for future use.
</P>
<P>
Now she has been declared free from cancer, she wants to start
a family.
</P>
<P>
However, while the government watchdog which regulates
fertility treatment in the UK allows women to have their eggs
frozen, it does not allow doctors to subsequently fertilize them -
or even thaw them.
</P>
<P>
And Carolyn even needs official permission to take her eggs
abroad to a country which allows the procedure.
</P>
<P>
The Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority says it is not
yet convinced that the procedure would result in healthy babies,
even though it has been carried out more than 30 times in
countries such as Italy and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Carolyn Neill's eggs are currently stored at the Assisted
Reproduction and Gynaecology Center in London, whose director, Dr
Mohammed Taranissi, is battling for the procedure to be approved.
</P>
<P>
The fertilization authority is due to review the issue of
frozen eggs in January.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: U.S. Attaches Importance to Energy Development in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, the Unites States, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and
African energy ministers concluded their three-day conference here
Wednesday afternoon with the U.S. government vowing to forge a
strengthened energy partnership between America and Africa.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the first of its kind in gathering the U.
S. and African energy ministers nearly on a continent-wide basis,
Bill Richardson, the U.S. secretary of energy, and Susan Rice,
assistant secretary of state for African affairs, both voiced the
U.S. strong commitment to further U.S.-African energy cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The event, with the theme of "A Partnership for the 21st
Century," also follows up on President Bill Clinton's historic
visit to Africa last year.
</P>
<P>
"This conference is a cornerstone of my African Energy
Initiative to foster energy cooperation and sustainable
development in Africa into the next century and beyond,"
Richardson said Tuesday at the conference's plenary session.
</P>
<P>
Energy development in Africa is crucial to the United States,
whose energy appetite has been skyrocketing over the past five
decades. The reasons are very evident.
</P>
<P>
First, the United States, the only economic and political
superpower in today's world, is anxious to maintain its energy
security as it is increasingly depending on African energy,
massively described as "blood for economic advancement." Following
the U.S. bid for the Caspian Sea oil, the United States is turning
its eyes on Africa for its future steady source of energy,
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Africa exported some 1.4 million barrels of oil a day
to the United States, about 17 percent of total U.S. oil imports,
against the backdrop of 23 percent imported by the U.S. from the
oil-rich Gulf region. At present, Africa is the eighth-largest
exporter of petroleum to the United States.
</P>
<P>
"Americans are depending increasingly on Africa, one of the
world's untapped energy markets, to fuel cars, to heat living
rooms and to power industry, " Rice said Tuesday at the plenary
session.
</P>
<P>
Secondly, the Clinton Administration wants to work very closely
with Africa to increase American investment on the continent,
especially in the electricity grid, in energy renewable projects,
and in sustainable energy development.
</P>
<P>
The United States is seeking more business opportunities in
African energy development as energy demand by African industries
is projected to grow by 4 percent a year.
</P>
<P>
In fact, both energy consumption and production in Africa have
been on the rise. "Commercial energy consumption is growing
throughout Africa," the U.S. Department of Energy said in its
statistical information. "Energy demand growth in Africa averaged
2.7 percent annually from 1980 through 1970, and a slightly faster
3.1 percent annual average from 1990 and 1997."
</P>
<P>
As Rice put it Tuesday, "Americans are working hard to be both
investors and consumers of African energy." That mirrors
significant U.S. commercial interest in Africa, especially in the
energy sector.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the U.S. Department of Energy is working in Ghana on
solar energy projects, in South Africa on energy efficiency, and
in Uganda to develop geothermal resources. "We have established
successful partnerships with Egypt and Morocco, and we are making
progress in our partnerships with Nigeria and Senegal," Richardson
has said.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, Washington hopes to develop more common strategies
with Africa on climate change policies, on issues relating to the
reduction of greenhouse gas emissions.
</P>
<P>
Africa now has relatively low overall carbon emissions, but
these are expected to soar in the next century, according to
Richardson.
</P>
<P>
African carbon emissions from fossil fuel consumption,
excluding natural gas flaring, are growing rapidly, although from
a very small base. "Carbon emissions in Africa roughly tripled,
from 72 million metric tons (Mmt) in 1970 to 202 Mmt in 1997, and
are projected to reach 325 Mmt in 2020," said the figures from the
U.S. Department of Energy.
</P>
<P>
"Africa's share of world carbon emissions has increased
slightly from 2 percent in 1970 to around 2 percent in 1997, and
is expected to remain about constant through 2020," according to
the statistics.
</P>
<P>
However, what Africans need is not words, but actions. In
Africa, where some country was counting ballots under dim candle
light and many Africans have never seen bulbs, fair play in the
world markets and apolitical investments are the two challenges
facing the continent, which is being growingly marginalized in the
current globalization process.
</P>
<P>
The United States should not only focus its attention on Africa
's energy sector, but also take effective actions against the
heavy debt burden in many African countries and HIV/AIDS disease,
which created massive orphanage in Africa.
</P>
<P>
Just like what an African energy minister said here during the
conference, "it seems that the U.S. is getting more serious about
Africa, but we Africans do need genuine actions, rather than lip
service."

<HEADLINE> U.S., African Energy Ministers Issue Tucson Communique </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TUCSON, the United States, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. and
African energy ministers Wednesday afternoon issued the Tucson
Communique here, saying that they vowed to strengthen energy
cooperation among and between the United States and African
countries.
</P>
<P>
The communique came at the end of the three-day U.S.-African
Energy Ministers Conference, which, beginning here Monday, was the
first international event that has gathered the U.S. energy
minister, Bill Richardson, and some 50 of his African counterparts
in this sun-shining city.
</P>
<P>
"In this meeting, the Ministers focused on policies and
practices that promote economic development, address environmental
concerns, encourage private investment, enhance regional
integration, and increase access to energy for Africa's people,"
the communique said.
</P>
<P>
"Such successful policies and practices will lead to the
creation of sustainable energy infrastructure for Africa in the
21st century and will advance Africa's economic and social
development," it said.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministers recognized the progress that has been achieved,
individually and collectively through bilateral, regional,
multilateral and international efforts, towards developing Africa'
s energy sector in a way that meets their mutual political,
economic, social and environmental goals," said the communique.
</P>
<P>
During the conference, the ministers accepted the invitation
of the government of Morocco to host a conference on sustainable
energy technology next year. Meanwhile, they accepted the
invitation of the government of South Africa to host a ministers
meeting next year and the invitation of the government of Algeria
to host a preparatory experts meeting next year and assess their
progress in this regard.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministers endorsed a Joint Statement on Sustainable
Energy Development and Cooperation in Support of the Environment,
confirming their agreement to implement sustainable energy
policies and promote clean energy options," the communique said.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministers, aware that private investment and partnership
are crucial to meeting Africa's growing energy needs in the 21st
century, issued a Joint Statement on Investment Principles for the
Energy Sector, demonstrating their agreement to create or sustain
the conditions that encourage investment in the energy sector,"
the communique added.

<HEADLINE> Wembley Stadium Plan Doubts Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, December 15 (Xinhua) -- The British Olympic Association
have admitted they still have "serious reservations" about the
ability of the new Wembley stadium to increase its seating
capacity for the standard of the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Wembley National Stadium Ltd (WNSL) said on Wednesday that UK
Athletics, the sport's governing body in Britain, have accepted
reassurances that the new 475 million pounds venue, centrepiece of
England's bid to host football's 2006 World Cup, could be adapted
to also stage the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
But officials at the Department of Culture, Media and Sport are
understood to remain privately concerned about the design, and a
WNSL spokesman said the company had not yet seen a second critical
report on amendments to Lord Foster's plans for the 90,000-seater
venue.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the BOA said: "We are pleased to learn Wembley
National Stadium Limited has now provided UK Athletics with the
necessary assurances regarding Wembley's ability to stage the 2005
World Athletics Championships.
</P>
<P>
"However, we continue to have serious reservations concerning
the ability of Wembley to increase its athletic seating capacity
to that required for an Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"These concerns, raised as soon as we learnt of Wembley's '
Olympic Solution', have been fueled by the independent report from
Ellerbe Becket and subsequent meetings and discussions.
</P>
<P>
"On Thursday Craig Reedie (chairman) and Simon Clegg (chief
executive) of the British Olympic Association will again meet with
the Secretary of State and Minister for Sport to press for a
solution to be achieved which will take into account the Olympic
requirements which the BOA made known to DCMS and Sport England
some two years ago," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
The current Wembley stadium is due to be replaced by the new hi-
tech venue in 2003.
