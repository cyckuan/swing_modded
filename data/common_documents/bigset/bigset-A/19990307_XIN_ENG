<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Seek Development With Science, Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- South China's booming province of
Guangdong will seek economic development by promoting the
advancement of science and education, provincial Party committee
secretary Li Changchun said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, is attending the ongoing Second
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese
legislature, which opened in Beijing Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
"We're now at a critical moment of economic globalization," Li
told his fellow legislators during a panel discussion of the
Guangdong delegation about the Government Work Report delivered by
Premier Zhu Rongji at the opening meeting of the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
In order to seize the current historic opportunity, Li said,
efforts must be made to promote China's scientific and educational
development, while a national system for inspiring people's
creativity and prompting scientific and technological innovations
should be established as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
"Premier Zhu highlighted the significance of reinvigorating our
country with science and education in his report, and this is just
the development strategy our province should adopt for the coming
period," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that measures should be taken to encourage
enterprises to engage themselves in scientific research and
technical innovation with greater enthusiasm, and that the
existing management system for scientific and technological
research must be reformed to meet the demand of the market economy.
</P>
<P>
"Guangdong has decided to establish scientific and
technological development centers in 50 major local enterprises,
which will enable the local sci-tech research personnel to assume
a more significant role in the economic development," he added.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members on Expanding China's Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Second Session of the Ninth
National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC) held a press conference today.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the factors behind the decreasing private
investment last year, Tu Yourui, a CPPCC National Committee member,
said that most of the money for capital spending went to
infrastructure projects in 1998, which is not a hot area for
private investors since these projects cost a large sum of money,
take a long time to complete and promise low investment return.
</P>
<P>
Another CPPCC member, economist Zhang Shiyao, aired his view on
how to tap the huge rural market potential. "Work should be done
in five aspects," he pointed out, "The income of the farmers needs
to increase; the manufacturers and the marketers should join hands
when tapping the rural market; the commodity distribution system
should be improved in rural China; and the infrastructure
facilities in rural areas should be improved."
</P>
<P>
CPPCC member Wu Jinglian, a noted Economist, said that weak
domestic demand will continue to plague China for some time, and
the government will face difficulties in activating the market
demand to stimulate economy.
</P>
<P>
"Continuously falling commodity prices, continuous state
enterprise reform, reform in social security system and the
housing sector, and sluggish foreign trade posed great challenges
for the government to expand the domestic demand," said Wu, who is
also a researcher with the State Council Development Center.
</P>
<P>
But the Economist also stressed that the situation could be
improved and more favorable economic environment be created as
long as greater efforts and more concrete measures are taken in
that regard.

<HEADLINE> Dole Says Kosovo Albanians to Sign Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Senator Bob Dole, who
met Kosovo Albanian representatives in Macedonia Friday, said here
Saturday he expected the Albanians would sign the Contact Group
peace plan Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"They (Kosovo Albanians) indicated many times they will keep
their word and I think they will keep their word and they will
sign tomorrow. It takes courage but in my view it will be done,"
Dole told reporters at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
Dole had earlier briefed U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who arrived in London on her way home from Asia, about
the intentions of ethnic Albanians towards the peace plan.
</P>
<P>
Also at the meeting were General Wesley Clark, the U.S. Army
general who commands NATO forces in Europe, Kosovo mediator
Christopher Hill and Jim O'Brien, a State Department official
helping with the negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But Hill was more cautious at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"There's been a lot of progress made and there was more
progress yesterday and we're hoping we'll have an agreement in the
future," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Hill said he expected all the groups represented at the talks
at Rambouillet near Paris last month to sign.
</P>
<P>
"Several of the groups are ready to sign and the Kosovo
Liberation Army will make their decision tomorrow," Hill said.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo peace plan offers the Serbian province's ethnic
Albanian majority "substantial autonomy" for an interim period of
three years and a NATO implementation force to ensure peace in
that region.
</P>
<P>
At the Rambouillet talks, held in the French town last month,
the ethnic Albanian delegation came close to accepting the peace
plan before asking to consult their people in Kosovo and report
back for more talks in France on March 15.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian side rejects the NATO force but says it is willing
to consider political aspects of the deal.
</P>
<P>
Albright is on her way home from visits to China, Thailand and
Indonesia. She arrived in London to see Dole and British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook, whom she will meet Saturday afternoon to
discuss the Kosovo situation and the Locherbie issue.

<P>
HANOI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam is consulting ASEAN member
countries for organizing a ceremony in Hanoi to grant membership
to Cambodia as soon as possible, A Vietnamese Foreign Ministry
spokesperson said here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson said Vietnamese Foreign Minister Nguyen Manh
Cam has received a letter from S. Jayakumar, the Singaporean
foreign minister and chairman of ASEAN's Standing Committee,
saying Cambodian Foreign Minister Hor Nam Hong had written to him
asking ASEAN to hold an admission ceremony for Cambodia as decided
at the sixth ASEAN summit in Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson was answering questions from foreign
journalists about when ASEAN will hold a ceremony to admit
Cambodia into the regional grouping.
</P>
<P>
The Singaporean foreign minister requested Vietnam, in its
capacity as the host country, to consult the parties concerned
about a date for holding a special admission ceremony for
Cambodia, said the spokesperson.
</P>
<P>
Vietnam would announce the date as soon as it can be arranged,
said the spokesperson.

<HEADLINE> Albright to Discuss Bananas With UK Counterpart </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 5 (Xinhua) -- In a bid to resolve the escalating
trade war with the United States over banana imports, British
Foreign Secretary Robin Cook will meet U.S. Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright for talks Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Cook told reporters Friday the hastily arranged meeting with
Albright, who will pass through London on her way back from a trip
to Asia, represents a chance to discuss how to get their relations
back on track.
</P>
<P>
"We are both committed to free trade and I would certainly wish
to argue that it is not helpful for America unilaterally to impose
trade sanctions on Britain," Cook was quoted by Reuters as saying
during a trip to the Russian Black Sea resort of Sochi.
</P>
<P>
"My message to Madeleine Albright... is that our two countries
have much more in common than we have in disagreement and we ought
to make sure that disagreements do not come between us when we
have so much to gain by working closely together."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Britain's Foreign Office summoned the U.S.
ambassador in London for the second time in 24 hours to reprimand
him about an escalating trade war over bananas. The meeting
yielded no progress in resolving the dispute, according to local
media reports.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Philip Lader sought to calm troubled diplomatic
waters and insisted the United States would work hard with Britain
to find a solution to the threat of a trade war, calling the
threat nothing more than an "irritant" in the friendship between
Britain and the United States.
</P>
<P>
"We're working towards finding an amicable solution, one that
is consistent with WTO rules," Lader told the press after the
meeting.

<HEADLINE> N.Irish Leader Moves to End Arms Stalemate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Northern Ireland leader David
Trimble Saturday issued an unprecedented invitation to the Irish
Republican Army (IRA) Sinn Fein political wing to engage talks to
end a stalemate over guns that is blocking the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said he had invited Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams and
his deputy Martin McGuinness for direct talks to try to find a way
out of the weapons crisis which is threatening the success of the
peace accord signed on April 10 last year, according to a Reuters
report.
</P>
<P>
"When I've met them before, it was in response to their
requests for meetings. This time I've sent an invitation to them,"
he was quoted as telling the BBC radio in an interview.
</P>
<P>
Under pressure from his Protestant Ulster Unionist Party,
Trimble has refused to let Sinn Fein take its seats in a new
Northern Ireland executive until its IRA allies start disarming.
</P>
<P>
Trimble said they would discuss setting up a new executive, but
the IRA would have to move on disarmament first.
</P>
<P>
"We will see what we can do to help them (Sinn Fein) to carry
out their obligation by arranging for the formation of the
executive to follow as quickly as possible on the heels of that,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein chairman Mitchel McLaughlin said his party would
respond positively and the meeting with Trimble and the deputy
leader of his party, John Taylor, would follow in the next few
days.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, British Prime Minister Tony Blair's
spokesman said the March 10 target date for a handover of limited
home-rule power from London to Belfast was looking difficult.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan, India to Release Civilian Prisoners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan and India on Saturday
agreed to release civilian prisoners in each other's jails who
have already completed their prison terms.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached here after two days of talks between
the two countries on modalities for the early release of civilian
prisoners and fishermen of the other side in their respective
custody.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Pakistan will release 18 Indian civilian
prisoners while India will free 43 Pakistanis.
</P>
<P>
Ahmed Jawad, joint secretary of the Interior Minitry of
Pakistan, led the Pakistani team while Gurcharan Sing, joint
secretary of the Ministry of Home Affairs of India, headed the
Indian side at the talks which started here Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement issued after the talks, the two
sides exchanged lists of civilian prisoners and held discussions
to reconcile the numbers of prisoners indicated by each other.
</P>
<P>
"They came to the conclusion that the exact number of civilian
prisoners of each side in the custody of the other can be
determined only after further investigations in the light of the
fresh information exchanged during the course of discussions," the
statement said.
</P>
<P>
They also agreed that in keeping with humanitarian
considerations as well as the legal and administrative
requirements of the two sides, the civilian prisoners, whose
national status have been confirmed, and who have already
completed their prison sentences, should be released and
repatriated expeditiously.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that the process of verification in respect of the
remaining civilian prisoners would be completed in a period of two
months, so that at the end of this period, no civilian prisoner,
who has completed his prison sentence and whose national status
has been confirmed, remains in the custody of the other country.
</P>
<P>
The two sides also discussed the issue of fishermen of one
country detained by the other. They reiterated their commitment
that fishermen, who inadvertently stray into each other's
territorial waters, should be released expeditiously along with
their boats after necessary investigations are completed and
travel documents made available.
</P>
<P>
The Indian side agreed to release 26 Pakistani fishermen and
three boats and the Pakistani side to release 109 Indian fishermen
and 17 boats on completion of procedures.
</P>
<P>
It was further agreed that the procedures in this regard will
be completed within one month.
</P>
<P>
As regards unconfirmed claims by both sides concerning their
boats and fishermen in the custody of the other, it was decided
that both sides would conduct further investigations and inform
the other side of the results.

<HEADLINE> Rover Cars Applies for British State Aid to Save </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Britain's Rover car, which is owned
by Germany's BMW group now, announced Saturday that it has applied
to the English government for an aid package to save its ailing
main factory in the Midlands.
</P>
<P>
BMW spokesman Richard Gaul said the future of the Longbridge
car factory near Birmingham where more than 10,000 people are
employed was in the balance. A BMW annual general meeting in
Munich on May 18 is expected to decide what to do about the plant.
</P>
<P>
Gaul did not put a figure on the sum of money BMW needs to save
the factory. Under European Union rules maximum investment aid of
20 percent is permitted.
</P>
<P>
A figure of 200 million pounds sterling (321.28 million U.S.
dollars) was being discussed, according to a report of the
newspaper Financial Times.
</P>
<P>
"Without investment assistance Longbridge is at a
disadvantage," said Gaul. He said the aid application submitted to
the Department of Trade and Industry Thursday was the first step
in the process of deciding the plant's future.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted an English government official as saying it
was a "positive sign" that the company was thinking of using the
factory to build a "new generation of midrange car."
</P>
<P>
London has signaled in the past that it would be prepared to
inject some money into Rover, possibly as much as 167 million
dollars if it was paired with an EU grant for the same amount. A
government decision on the aid package is expected within the next
few weeks.
</P>
<P>
Rover has suffered heavy losses owing to poor sales,
restructuring costs and the strength of sterling. The company's
fiercest champion, Bernd Pischetsrieder, was ousted as chairman in
a boardroom upheaval last month. He led BMW's takeover of Rover in
1994.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Release of Diya, Step of National </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The announcement of the Nigerian
government to release Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya and other coup
plotters this week is the latest step of the national
reconciliation process in the country since last June.
</P>
<P>
General Olusegun Obasanjo, winner of the February 27
presidential election, and others, who were sentenced because of
coup related offenses, regained their freedom a few days after
General Abdulsalami Abubakar assumed office in June, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Lt. General Diya, former chief of general staff, and others
released Thursday are the final batch of the military officers and
civilians involved in the alleged coup plotting against the Sani
Abacha regime in 1995 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
At the top of those released with Diya are Major General
Abdulkareem Adisa, former works and housing minister, Major
General Tajudeen Olanrewaju, former communications minister and
Niran Malaolu, editor of The Diet Newspapers among others who were
arrested in December 1997.
</P>
<P>
In the other batch of the released convicts are Col. Lawan
Gwadabe, former military governor of Niger State, Col. Bellow
Fadile, former director of army legal services, and other middle
level officers and civilians.
</P>
<P>
General Obasanjo, president-elect and former head of state,
Chris Anyanwu, Ben Charles Obi and Kunle Ajibade, all journalists,
were virtually in this group, but they were granted earlier pardon
by Abubakar.
</P>
<P>
The government of the day said this group of people rounded up
between February and March 1995 were instrumental to undisclosed
plans to topple the Abacha regime.
</P>
<P>
The coup saga originally started as rumors, and even after the
announcement of the plot by the then defense spokesman, Brig. Gen.
Fred Chijuka, there were still cloud of doubts.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the level of officers involved in the drama and
their limited command positions easily gave out the story as a
hoax.
</P>
<P>
However, the Abacha regime set up a tribunal to determine the
level of involvement of the accused and sentenced them to death
initially and commuted to various terms of imprisonment later.
</P>
<P>
Diya and his group were tried in February last year and
sentenced to death, but their sentences were yet to be confirmed
by the Provisional Ruling Council (PRC) before the sudden death of
Abacha on June 8 last year.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after Abubakar ascended office, the death sentences
were reverted to various years of imprisonment with Diya and other
alleged principal actors having their death sentences commuted to
25 years imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
Following the release of General Obasanjo and others last June,
 Nigerians were making efforts to plead for clemency for the
former Chief of General Staff Lt. Gen. Diya and others, arguing
that since their offense was the same, there was no justification
to keep them in prison.
</P>
<P>
But they did not immediately achieve their objective because of
division among members of the PRC, Nigeria's highest
policy-making body.
</P>
<P>
Following the conclusion of the February 27 presidential
election, the Nigerian government made the decision Thursday
morning of releasing Diya and others after a 10-hour meeting of
the PRC.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the decision, Vice Admiral Akhigbe, chief of the
general staff, said the pardon was also extended to the dead
including the late General Shehu Musa Yar'adua, who died in
Abakaliki prison in December 1997, and late Lt. Col. Olu Akiyode,
who died last month in Makurdi prison.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe noted that the decision to grant pardon to both the
living and the dead was taken in the spirit of national
reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
There were jubilations and merry-making in different parts of
the west African country Thursday following the announcement of

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumers Borrowing Increases Fast in January </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Federal Reserve figures
showed that borrowing by U.S. consumers increased at a faster pace
in January as all categories of debt rose, the New York Times
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Borrowing rose by 14.7 billion U.S. dollars to 1.316 trillion
dollars in January, after a revised increase of 3.1 billion
dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
The Fed said consumer credit rose at a 13.5 percent annual rate
during January, up from the 2.9 percent pace in December. It was
the biggest increase in more than a year.
</P>
<P>
The figures also showed that revolving loans outstanding, which
include credit card debt, rose by 5.7 billion dollars in January,
up from a 3.9 billion dollars increase in December. Auto loans
rose 6.5 billion dollars, up from 4.4 billion dollars. Other types
of installment loans rose by 2.5 billion dollars, after falling
5.2 billion dollars in December.
</P>
<P>
Economists watch the Fed's credit report because it helps them
gauge consumer spending, which accounts for two-thirds of economic
output. The report does not, however, track loans secured by real
estate, like home equity loans.
</P>
<P>
With the economy expanding and unemployment close to a 30-year
low, consumers have been sending money at the fastest pace in 14
years. Some economists caution that consumers may be taking on
too much debt, especially if the economy sours.

<HEADLINE> Harare Vendors' Arrest Worries Association </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe Informal Sector
Association (ZISA) said Saturday it was worried by the arrest of
2,000 of its members by police and Harare municipal officers this
week.
</P>
<P>
ZISA president Walter Dodo told the Zimbabwe News Agency Ziana
that the informal traders were arrested in Harare, the country's
capital for selling their wares from undesignated points.
</P>
<P>
He said using the outbreak of cholera as an excuse to stop
vendors from carrying on with their business was unreasonable.
</P>
<P>
"People in the informal sector are working hard to earn a
decent living in these times of economic hardship, but of recent,
they have been loosing their goods to unscrupulous police
officers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The association has engaged lawyers to seek the release of its
members and file a complaint with the courts to have the arrest of
vendors stopped, he said.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of vendors, said Dodo, cannot be the best solution
to end the cholera problem.
</P>
<P>
Harare police this week raided and demolished food points all
over the city as the city intensifies its efforts to curb the
spread of the epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Vendors who were arrested were compelled to pay fines ranging
from 400 Zimbabwean dollars (10 U.S. dollars) to 600 Zimbabwean
dollars (15 U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Cholera has so far claimed 100 lives countrywide while more
than 800 others have been infected.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic spreads easily in dirty conditions and people are
encouraged to practice hygiene.

<HEADLINE> Southern Africa Urged to Adopt Industrialization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe Integrated Program (ZIP),
a non-governmental organization, said Saturday there is need for
southern Africa to adopt a regional industrialization policy to
help improve economies in the region.
</P>
<P>
At an annual general meeting in Bulawayo, the country's second
largest city, Nkosana Moyo, ZIP official responsible for business
and national economic matters, said a regional rather than country
by country industrialization policy would boost investor
confidence in most countries, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"Under this approach, areas of desirable investment will be
identified across the region and for these identified areas, the
whole sub-region would be unified as one market, with no trade
tariffs for the specific goods and services," he said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, Moyo said, if southern African governments adopted
the approach, the region would be more successful in attracting
direct foreign investment in the relevant areas.
</P>
<P>
He said currently most southern African countries particularly
Zimbabwe, were faced with economic crisis due to some improper
policies and lack of competent management.
</P>
<P>
The meeting is aimed at sensitizing people on the need for an
integrated approach in developmental activities.

<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived in Saudi capital Riyadh Saturday for talks
with Saudi leaders on regional issues and bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is the second leg of Cohen's nine-nation Middle
East tour, which has taken him to Bahrain. The tour also includes
stops in Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, Egypt,
Jordan and Israel.
</P>
<P>
Before Cohen's departure from Washington Friday, a senior
U.S. defense official said that Cohen intended to consult with his
counterparts and other senior government officials in the region
on the Mideast peace process and long-term regional security.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the U.S. wanted to ensure its allies in
the Gulf to remain secure from external threats, especially the
growing threat of weapons of mass destruction, allegedly posed by
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"We will continue to discuss overall strategies and how to
deal with (Iraqi President) Saddam Hussein," the U.S. official
added.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time Cohen has come to the region since
October 1998 when he discussed with Gulf Arab leaders the
possibility of establishing a theater missile defense system in
the area, a matter which had reportedly received a lukewarm
response from most Gulf countries.

on this year's International Women's Day, the IIE announced
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"As a follow-up to Hillary Rodham Clinton's visit to Beijing
last June, these dynamic women leaders are visiting the United
States for three weeks through the Citizens Exchange Program of
the U.S. Information Agency," the IIE said in a press release.
</P>

<HEADLINE> France Urges Peaceful Solution to UAE-Iran Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 6 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Hubert
Vedrine Saturday called for a peaceful solution to a dispute
between the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Iran over three Gulf
islands.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine made the appeal at a press conference here. He
reiterated France's stance, calling for solution of the dispute
through direct negotiations or international arbitration.
</P>
<P>
Both Iran and the UAE claimed sovereignty over the islands of
Abu Musa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, which are located near
strategic shipping lanes at the mouth of the Gulf and potentially
oil-rich.
</P>
<P>
Iran has controlled the three islands since 1971 after Britain
ended its protectorate and offered in the past talks on Abu Musa
alone.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine, who arrived in Abu Dhabi Friday on a two-day visit,
expressed his regret at Iran's recent military exercises in seas
around Abu Musa, which he said were causing tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
But he said he had no intention to suggest a mediation on the
issue. "But France can make goodwill contacts with the two
countries, based on the good relations my country has with the two
sides," he added.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said he had had "very important" discussions with the
UAE President Sheikh Zayed Bin Sultan Al-Nahyan on the three
islands and other major issues such as the Palestinian possible
declaration of an independent state and the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said France believes the Palestinians have the right to
declare their state and is committed to making further efforts for
the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
On the Iraqi issue, Vedrine said France wanted a political
solution to safeguard the security, stability and sovereignty of
Iraq, adding that the latest military developments were not
serving these objectives.
</P>
<P>
Clashes between U.S.-British warplanes and Iraqi air defenses
have repeatedly taken place in the no-fly zones over northern and
southern Iraq since the mid-December bombardments.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said his discussions with Zayed also included the
problem of Kosovo, underlining his country's commitment to the
efforts aimed at finding a solution to what he described as "a
complex and difficult issue."
</P>
<P>
The UAE is part of Vedrine's regional tour, which will also
take him to Qatar and Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Sweden, Egypt Have Same Views: Swedish Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A senior Swedish official said on
Saturday that his country and Egypt have identical viewpoints on
various issues including the Mideast peace process and Iraq crisis.
</P>
<P>
After a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa,
Swedish Minister of International Development Cooperation Pierre
Schori told reporters that Sweden appreciates the role played by
Egypt in resolving conflicts in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
Schori said he discussed with Moussa the issues in the region
and in the Mediterranean area, including the Iraq crisis, the
Mideast peace process and the Lockerbie disputes between Libya, on
the one hand, and the United States and Britain, on the other.
</P>
<P>
The talks also touched on relations between the European Union
(EU) and the Mediterranean basin states, including Egypt, he said.
</P>
<P>
The 15 EU members and 12 Mediterranean countries have been
taking steps to enhance cooperation in political, economic, social
and security fields since 1995 when they kicked off the Euro-Med
partnership process at a meeting held in Barcelona, Spain.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting between the two minister, a letter of
intent for setting up a Swedish Cultural Center in Alexandria, a
Mediterranean port city 220 kilometers northwest of Cairo, was
signed.
</P>
<P>
Schori left here after ending a week-long visit. He told
reporters before departure that the planned Swedish institute in
Alexandria is aimed at launching an Christian-Islamic dialog
between Sweden and Egypt as well the Arabs and the Europeans.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's National Park Safe: Officer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bwindi National Park in
southwestern Uganda is now safe, less than a week after eight
foreign tourists were killed by Rwandan Hutu rebels, a senior
officer said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Benon Biraro, the second division commander of Ugandan forces,
made the statement when addressing reporters in Mbarara barracks,
270 km southwest of the capital Kampala, on Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"We've gathered forces to deal with the Interahamwe rebels and
we shall look for them until we get them," he said.
</P>
<P>
His forces have gone 40 kms deep into the Democratic Republic
of Congo (DRC) to track the Hutu rebels who killed 12 people
including eight foreign tourists in the park early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
"One battalion is already deployed in the park area and
reinforcements can be transported there at any time by
helicopters," he added.
</P>
<P>
When asked about the effect of the massacre on Uganda's
tourism, Biraro said it is a setback to the tourism industry, but
tourists will get back when they see security is being beefed up
in the region and that they can no longer be prone to attacks.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that Ugandan troops have killed ten of the Hutu
rebels who took part in the murder and that Rwandan troops have
killed 15 of them with cooperation of Ugandan forces.
</P>
<P>
On the motive of the rebels, he said they are just thugs
sneaking in from DRC to kill innocent people, adding, "I wouldn't
have been surprised if it had been part of the DRC's plot to
destabilize Uganda."
</P>
<P>
Soon after the murder, President Yoweri Museveni called a press
 conference to condemn the incident and asked Information Minister
Basoga Nsadhu to arrange journalists to visit the scene of the
murder.

<HEADLINE> New York City to Face Police Conduct Review </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Police in the New York City will
face a Federal Government investigation on incidents of brutality
which angered a number of black and Hispanic people.
</P>
<P>
For a long time, many minority communities in the city have
felt that city authorities "do not care enough about building
relations of trust or hearing their concerns about incidents of
police brutality," said the New York Times Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Civil Rights Commission, an independent fact-finding
agency of the Federal Government, ruled Friday that police
practices and police-community relations in New York and other
cities be investigated, and a hearing be held in late May.
</P>
<P>
The decision followed requests by civil rights activists to
review the police conduct in the aftermath of the fatal shooting
of Amadou Diallo, an unarmed street peddler from Guinea on
February 4 in Bronx of New York.
</P>
<P>
Diallo was killed in a hail of 41 bullets by officers from the
Street Crimes Unit.
</P>
<P>
"Many charged that the unit routinely targeted black residents
as potential lawbreakers and exercised undue force against them,"
the Times said in an editorial entitled "A Federal Look at Police
Conduct."
</P>
<P>
Civil rights leaders have asserted that the incident fits into
a national pattern of police abuse against members of minorities.
</P>
<P>
Similar incidents have happened in Chicago and Los Angeles in
recent years.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak-Gaddafi Talks Key to Solving Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr Moussa
said on Saturday that the talks between Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the Lockerbie crisis
are "a key step towards a breakthrough" for the issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters during the day, Moussa said that contacts
on the Lockerbie issue are in progress and that the issue tops the
subjects discussed between Mubarak and Gaddafi.
</P>
<P>
Gaddafi, who arrived in Egypt on Friday, held a round of talks
with Mubarak on Saturday. The two leaders are discussing the
Lockerbie issue in depth in the evening.
</P>
<P>
Libya has been disputing with the United States and Britain
over the trial of two Libyans suspected of blowing up a Pan Am
jetliner in 1988 over Lockerbie, Scotland, killing 270 people.
</P>
<P>
Last Tuesday, Gaddafi said that he is willing to accept
guarantees and assurances by Saudi Arabia and South Africa on
resolving the issue.
</P>
<P>
Libya was seeking guarantees for the two suspects' security and
fair trial after agreeing to let them stand trial in the
Netherlands by Scottish judges under Scottish law.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether contacts have been made to bring points of view
closer over guarantees for a fair trial of two Libyans, Moussa
said that contacts are being made among the concerned parties,
including the United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan and that
progress has been made.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the contacts, especially those between
Libya and the U.N., will soon lead to a breakthrough in solving
the Lockerbie issue.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain succeeded in pressing the U.N. Security
Council in 1992 to impose an arms and flight embargo on Libya for
its failure to hand over the suspects to the countries for trial.

<HEADLINE> UK "Concerned" Over U.S.-EU Banana Trade War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary Robin
Cook has spelled out his "strong concern" Saturday to United
States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright at the U.S.'s action
in the banana trade war.
</P>
<P>
Cook attacked the "unilateral" action of the U.S. during his
meeting with Albright, a BBC television report said.
</P>
<P>
The attack came just ahead of the meeting of the World Trade
Organization (WTO), which is expected to be held in a few weeks to
discuss a solution to the quarrel on banana trade between U.S. and
the European Union.
</P>
<P>
But both Britain and the U.S. agreed on the need for urgent
talks between Washington and the EU to resolve the row, Cook told
reporters after his meeting with Albright.
</P>
<P>
Britain is furious that the U.S. decided to impose export
restrictions before a WTO ruling on the EU's revised banana
regime, which the WTO says unfairly favors small Caribbean
producers against others in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
"We both agreed that what is needed is urgent talks. We cannot
allow this dispute to damage relations between us. We both need an
urgent resolution and both agreed to seek one," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
He gave no further details of when the proposed EU-U.S. talks
might take place, but said he had made clear once again how
displeased Britain was with Washington's actions.
</P>
<P>
Washington and the EU have accused each other of rule-breaking
after the U.S. imposed high duties on European goods, angry at EU
preference for Caribbean imports over U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
Albright arrived in London Saturday morning on her way back
home from a visit to Asia.

<HEADLINE> Massacre Damage in Ugandan Park Hard to Assess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The damage done to Uganda by the
Interahamwe rebels who killed eight foreign tourists early Monday
morning is hard to assess and park authorities are busy
investigating what was looted.
</P>
<P>
Steven Asuma, warden in charge of tourism in the Bwindi
Impenetrable Forest National Park in southwestern Uganda, made the
remarks Saturday afternoon to reporters who were flown there to
interview the murder witnesses.
</P>
<P>
"They looted everything in every drawer in almost every office.
 They made away with radios, recorders. There were so many people
robbed by the rebels that it is really very hard to assess the
damage," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The more than 100 Interahamwe rebel also burned several
vehicles in the park.
</P>
<P>
Following the reports of the killings, many tour operators in
the country have received calls, demanding to cancel the planned
trips to national parks of the country.
</P>
<P>
The Bwindi National Park, which receives 200 to 300 tourists
each month, is now closed to tourists. Heavily armed soldiers are
seen patrolling in the region.
</P>
<P>
Bwindi National Park, just five kilometers from the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) border, was established in 1991 and is an
impenetrable forest park which covers more than 300 square kms.
</P>
<P>
Since it opened to tourists in 1993, the park has become one of
the world-famous tourist attractions because half of world's 600
mountain gorillas are there.
</P>
<P>
The attack caught people by surprise as the park had been
regarded as secure and no troops had been deployed there. When
the Hutu rebels sneaked into the forest from the DRC, only eight
people including park guards were armed.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid underlined on Saturday the importance of accelerating
the establishment of an Arab economic bloc.
</P>
<P>
Abdel-Meguid touched up the issue in a speech, read out by
Director of Arab Councils and Organizations Affairs Khalil Abu
Afifa, to the 26th Arab labor conference opened here in the day.
</P>
<P>
The establishment of an Arab free trade zone is in full swing,
the Arab League chief said, adding that 14 Arab countries have
applied to take part in the preparatory program of the zone.
</P>
<P>
He called for activation of the Arab Labor Agreement, endorsed
by the league in 1968, on the movement of manpower among the Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
He maintained that regional and world variables require the
activation of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The idea of an Arab common market has been circulating since
the 1950s. The 1996 Arab summit further called for the
acceleration of the creation of the free market.
</P>
<P>
At the end of 1997, the Arab League launched a regional free
trade program which is considered as a key step that could lead to
the creation of a common market.
</P>
<P>
The week-long Arab labor conference will discuss means of
facing up to the unemployment problem in the Arab countries and
promoting human resources.
</P>
<P>
It will review programs of Arab labor systems in the coming
stage and the role of government, employers and employees to curb
negative effects of the world economic variables.

<HEADLINE> Kremlin Criticizes Primakov for "Complacency" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Kremlin Saturday publicly
criticized Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov for his "complacency"
and hinted a possible reshuffle of the cabinet.
</P>
<P>
Oleg Sysuyev, President Boris Yeltsin's deputy chief of staff,
told the ORT television that the president is unhappy about the
slow movement in Russia's negotiations with the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
He said Primakov "has repeatedly said that his team is stable"
and "has repeatedly made very positive assessments of the
performance of the government as a whole."
</P>
<P>
"It seems to me Yevgeny Maximovich should be advised to be more
critical of the performance of the government because this
position of complacency can make the prime minister and ourselves
miss something that is of key importance," he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked whether Yeltsin might make any reshuffle in the
government, Sysuyev said that appointments and dismissals are the
"prerogative of the president" and that "the personnel policy is
not ossified."
</P>
<P>
"So it is impossible to guarantee any pattern here that could
lead anyone to believe they are in the government forever," he
added.
</P>
<P>
Sysuyev said Primakov enjoys a "very big reserve of confidence
on the part of the population... but this does not mean that this
confidence is endless."
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin "undoubtedly has no complacency about the
government.... He undoubtedly has critical remarks to make about
the performance of the government," Sysuyev said.
</P>
<P>
"The president is very worried about the future of the
negotiations with the International Monetary Fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
"If it becomes necessary, the president will personally
interfere in this process because he realizes how important the
results of the negotiations will be for Russia."
</P>
<P>
Sysuyev said Yeltsin supports Primakov politically, but the
president's assistance to the cabinet "will not be limited to
unconditional support for the performance of the government,"
Interfax reported.
</P>
<P>
"Such assistance will mean constructive and not always pleasant
work," he said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Calls for More Teachers, Smaller Classes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
Saturday urged the Senate to leave politics at the schoolhouse
door and approve his plan to hire more teachers over the next six
years.
</P>
<P>
"The choice is simple: Are we going to give Americans smaller
classes, or more partisanship?" Clinton said in his weekly radio
address. "Are we going to put politics ahead of progress, or put
100,000 teachers in our nation's classrooms?"
</P>
<P>
The Senate Wednesday took up an education bill that previewed
the big philosophical battles over class size and other school
issues expected in Congress this year.
</P>
<P>
Clinton accused Republican congressional leaders of "trying to
shut down debate" and thwart his proposal for another round of
grants to help schools reach the goal Clinton and Congress set in
1998 of hiring 100,000 new teachers over the next six years.
</P>
<P>
The Education Flexibility Partnership Act also known as
"Ed-Flex" would give school districts more leeway in how they
spend certain federal funds. The program already exists in 12
states, and the legislation would extend it to all 50.
</P>
<P>
Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, a Republican, has promised a
vote Monday to force the legislation's passage without Democratic
amendments.
</P>
<P>
Clinton and congressional Democrats want to use the bill as a
vehicle for winning a second year of financing for grants to help
school districts hire and train 100,000 new teachers over seven
years.
</P>
<P>
In budget negotiations leading up to last November's election,
Republicans agreed to the first round of grants, more than 2
billion U.S. dollars to be released in July.
</P>
<P>
"We now have the first big test of whether this Congress is
really willing to work together across party lines and with the
White House to get things done," Clinton said Saturday, "whether
the Congress is serious about giving our children the education
they need and deserve."
</P>
<P>
The goal is to cut pupil-teacher ratios in the first through
third grades. The national average now is 22 pupils per teacher,
and Clinton wants that reduced to 18 or fewer.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Upholds Legitimacy of Kabbah Gov't: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABUJA, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalami Abubakar said Saturday his government would continue
to uphold the legitimacy of the Ahmed Kabbah government in Sierra
leone.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian leader made the remarks when he received a report
on the invasion of capital Freetown on January 6 by the rebels,
which was delivered by visiting Sierra Leone Justice Minister
Solomon Preware Saturday in capital Abuja.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar said the Nigerian government would study the report
and take "appropriate action" against some countries behind the
January 6 invasion during which about 5,000 people were killed.
</P>
<P>
He noted that his government would encourage dialog between the
Kabbah government and the rebel Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
to seek lasting peace in that country.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has accused Liberian President Charles Taylor and some
unnamed west African countries and member countries of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) of supporting the RUF rebels
who began their insurgency in 1991.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, who denied the charges, has however arrested eight
people including a Briton on charges of aiding the rebels who have
a long time relationship of collaborating with the rebel movement
headed by the Liberian president.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led west African peace-keeping troops of ECOMOG
have been fighting to flush out the rebels from other parts of the
country after successfully containing the January 6 offensive
aimed at retaking capital Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abubakar Saturday received Victor Mpoyo, senior
minister from the Democratic Republic of Congo, and lamented that
African countries had been dissipating energy on unnecessary
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
Mpoyo said he was in Nigeria to brief the Nigerian leader on
developments in the vast central African country, which is engaged
in a civil war.

<HEADLINE> New York City to Offer More Tourist Information </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, March 6 (Xinhua) -- With the opening of a new visitor
information center, the New York City is expected to meet tourists
with "a more hospitable face," said a local media report Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Though a popular tourist destination, New York often makes
new-comers feel uncomfortable when they find it difficult to get
to favorite tourist spots due to the lack of enough information
service and detailed maps.
</P>
<P>
It is against this background that the New York Convention and
Visitors Bureau (CVB) opened a computerized visitor information
center in midtown New York Friday, with touch screens for
consumers to find attractions.
</P>
<P>
The 2,200 square foot center shows that the city "has finally
caught up with other cities in trying to cater to its tourists,"
the New York Times quoted CVB President Fran Reiter as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tourism creates a revenue of over 14 billion U.S. dollars for
the city, with some 35 million visitors expected for 1999.

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Civilians Injured in U.S., British Raids </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- A number of Iraqi civilians were
injured Saturday when U.S. and British warplanes fired missiles at
civilian and military targets, an Iraqi military spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 8:30 a.m. (0530 GMT) nine formations
enemy warplanes coming from Saudi and Kuwaiti bases violated
southern Iraqi airspace over Nasiriya, Basra and Samawa provinces.
</P>
<P>
He said that enemy planes fired missiles at civil service
installations and some military sites, injuring a number of
civilians. No exact figure was given.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi air defense units counter-attacked the enemy planes and
forced them to flee, he added.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that at 11:25 a.m. (0825 GMT), eleven
formations of enemy planes coming from a Turkish air base violated
northern Iraqi airspace over Neineva, Dohuk and Erbil provinces.
</P>
<P>
These planes launched missiles at an Iraqi anti-aircraft
artillery site, and Iraqi air defense units repulsed them at 2:35
p.m. (1135 GMT).
</P>
<P>
Since the mid-December U.S. and British air strikes against
Iraq, clashes between U.S. and British jets patrolling the no-fly
zones and the Iraqi air defense forces have almost become daily
occurrence.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-led western allies imposed the no-fly zones in
northern and southern Iraq following the 1991 Gulf War, with a
claimed aim of protecting the Kurds in the north and the Shiite
Muslims in the south from "Baghdad's suppression."

<HEADLINE> Iraqi President Meets Arab League's Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) envoy Ahmed Ben
Hulli stressed Saturday that the Arab people stand firmly with the
Iraqi people against U.S. aggression and AL is determined to
continue its efforts to lift the sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Hulli, special envoy of AL Secretary-General Ahmed Esmat
Abdel-Meguid, made the remark in talks with Iraqi President Saddam
Hussein, the Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Hulli, who is also assistant secretary-general of the league,
arrived here Thursday and conveyed a letter from Abdel-Meguid to
Saddam, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
He said AL would like to listen to Iraq's viewpoints on Arab
issues, adding that the letter Saddam sent to Abdel-Meguid last
month contained positive and encouraging points.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Saddam stressed that Iraq's position
concerning the issues of the Arab nation is based on principles,
said INA.
</P>
<P>
In his letter to Abdel-Meguid, Saddam defended Iraqi Foreign
Minister Mohammed Saeed al-Sahhaf's walk-out from AL foreign
ministers' meeting held in Cairo on January 24, saying al-Sahhaf
did that to protest AL's failure to condemn U.S.-British
aggression on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched air strikes against Iraq in
mid-December with a declared aim of punishing Baghdad for not
cooperating with U.N. weapons inspectors authorized to oversee
Iraq's elimination of weapons of mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
The AL foreign ministers' meeting fell short of Iraq's demand
for condemning the U.S.-British bombardment and ignoring the U.N.
sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
</P>
<P>
However, Saddam signaled willingness to hold dialog with all
Arab states, including Saudi Arabia and Kuwait which Iraq accused
of facilitating U.S. and British aggression against Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Photo Exhibit Features Merrill's Marauders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, March 7 (Xinhua) - A photo exhibit featuring the
exploits of Merrill's Marauders is being held in Chongqing
Municipality, a leading industrial and commercial center in
southwest China, since last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The American military unit led by Frank D. Merrill joined the
Chinese army in battling invading Japanese forces along the Sino-
Indian-Burma border during World War II.
</P>
<P>
The exhibit, which will run through March 14, is held to mark
the 20th anniversary of the normalization of Sino-American
relations in 1979.
</P>
<P>
Merrill organized and led a volunteer regiment which arrived in
India for guerrilla training in August 1943. The regiment's goal
was to retake northern Burma (now Myanmar) from Japanese forces.
</P>
<P>
The regiment marched several hundred miles from Ledo in India's
Assam Province through Burma's mountainous jungles to outflank the
enemy and disrupt the enemy's lines of communication.
</P>
<P>
The exhausted and malnourished "Marauders" joined Chinese
reinforcements in a successful campaign to capture the Myitkyina
Airfield in May 1944. They extended the Stilwell (formerly Ledo)
Road from India to the juncture of the Burma Road and China,
providing an overland supply route to supplement air routes over
the Himalayas, or the so-called "Hump".
</P>
<P>
The exhibit features over 300 black and white photographs, as
well as numerous documents which offer detailed accounts of
historic events during the period.
</P>
<P>
The General Joseph W. Stilwell Foundation donated Japanese
swords and other items captured by American soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The exhibits will be permanently housed in Chongqing's Stilwell
Museum.

<HEADLINE> Giant Pandas Bound for Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Central government recently
announced plans to send two giant pandas as gifts to the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region.
</P>
<P>
The giant pandas from the Wolong Nature Reserve in northwest
China's Sichuan Province will be shipped to Hong Kong's Ocean Park
later this month.
</P>
<P>
An'an and his mate Jiajia were born in wild. Jiajia has
produced five cubs.
</P>
<P>
Ocean Park has invested 85 million Hong Kong dollars to build a
20,000 sq.m. facility equipped with temperature and moisture
control systems to provide a living environment similar to that
found in Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
Wolong, a 200,000-ha reserve in northwestern Sichuan, was
established in 1963 and is currently home to over 100 giant pandas.
</P>
<P>
The reserve's Giant Panda Research Center has used artificial
insemination to breed 21 panda cubs since 1991. Fifteen of the
cubs have survived.
</P>
<P>
Giant pandas are considered to be one of world's most
endangered species. Most of the world's 1,000-odd giant pandas are
found in Sichuan.

Expressing his confidence in the HKSAR government in overcoming
difficulties and maintaining stability and prosperity, Jiang said
that on the whole the situation in Hong Kong is good in spite of
the impact of the Asian financial crisis. "We have ample reasons
to have full confidence in a glorious future of Hong Kong," he
added.
</P>
<P>
"Our motherland and the 1.2 billion Chinese people are the
strongest backing for Hong Kong. Whatever happens and whatever
difficulties and challenge Hong Kong faces, the motherland and the
people will provide the strongest support and remain in the same
boat with the Hong Kong compatriots," Jiang stressed.

Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan announced at today's news
conference that the joint work group on boundary questions between

</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, officials of foreign ministries of China and
India made useful discussions and held useful talks in Beijing,"
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Recently we have noticed that leaders of India have on several
occasions made public statements, expressing their wish to improve
relations with China," the minister said. "They have also
repeatedly said that at present India does not regard China as a
threat to India."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that China welcomes efforts made by
India and Pakistan toward improving their relations. On the
question of nuclear tests, Tang said, "We urge both India and

<P>
"This demonstrates that there are always some people who want
to obstruct normal Sino-US trade relations and the normal export
of US hi-tech products to China," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister went on to emphasize that the Taiwan question has
always been the most important and most sensitive issue in Sino-US
relations which deserves the greatest attention.
</P>
<P>
China is "very much concerned about" the development of the
Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system by the United States and
Japan, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any attempt to include Taiwan in the TMD system will meet with
strong opposition from the entire Chinese people, including
compatriots in Taiwan," he said, explaining that such attempt will
inevitably amount to an encroachment on sovereignty and
territorial integrity of China and an obstruction to the great
cause of peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint research and development of TMD between
the U.S. and Japan will greatly enhance the overall offensive and
defensive capability of the military alliance, which will go far
beyond the legitimate defense needs that the relevant country has
repeatedly indicated.
</P>
<P>
"It will also harm peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region," he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang also denounced splittist activities by the Taiwan
authorities while answering a question about the possibility of
the two sides across the Taiwan Straits reaching a "diplomatic
truce".
</P>
<P>
"The current situation, to put it frankly, reflects that the
Taiwan authorities still cling stubbornly to the practice of
creating 'one China, one Taiwan' by expanding its international
space and pursue splittist activities," he said.
</P>
<P>
A complete reunification of China cannot be delayed
indefinitely, as it represents the common and strong aspiration of
all Chinese people including Taiwan compatriots, he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan met with the press here this afternoon at a press
conference sponsored by the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth
National People's Congress, China's legislature.
</P>
<P>
More than 500 Chinese and foreign journalists attended the
press conference in the Great Hall of the People, which was
broadcast live by the Central People's Radio Station, China
Central Television and China Radio International.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Tang said that China has made great
achievements at the diplomatic front in an international situation
of major, deep and complicated changes under the leadership of
Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
China would actively play a role with its own unique
characteristics in the world arena as a big developing country to
make greater contributions to peace and development in the world,
he said.
</P>
<P>
While answering questions, the foreign minister noted that
China's ties with major world powers, including the United States,
Russia, Japan and European nations, are developing, and that the
country has started to form a future-oriented framework of state-
to-state relations with nearly all major powers.
</P>
<P>
"The upcoming visit to the United States by Chinese Premier Zhu
Rongji next month will provide another opportunity for improving
and further developing Sino-US relations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The major objectives of Premier Zhu's visit are to enhance
mutual understanding, expand common ground and promote cooperation,
so as to maintain the good momentum of the improvement and growth
of China-US relations and allow the two countries to move toward
the objective of building a constructive and strategic partnership,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
normalization of Sino-US diplomatic relations, Tang said that
China is willing to bring a sound and stable relationship between
the two countries into the next century.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there have emerged some anti-China noises
within the United States recently, which is nothing strange.
</P>
<P>
"There are always some people who do not want to see Sino-US
relations develop and get improved, and they have always wanted to
do anything to disturb the development of such relations," said
the foreign minister. "But I believe that their attempt will get
nowhere and will be futile."

<P>
The minister went on to warn the United States not to "
backtrack" on its relations with China on the question of human
rights issue.
</P>
<P>
In response to a CNN question, Tang said that he thinks if
somebody attempts to table an anti-China draft resolution on human
rights again this year in Geneva, the outcome will not be
different from the previous seven times.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated what he said to U.S. State Secretary Madeleine
Albright last week at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"On the question of human rights, there will be no way out to
replace dialogue with confrontation. And to backtrack on this
issue will have no future," he said.
</P>
<P>
China has always stood for expanding common ground and
narrowing differences through dialogues on human rights issues, he
stressed.
</P>
<P>
"As long as our two sides can strictly adhere to the principles
of the three China-US joint communiques and the joint China-US
statement, especially such important principles as mutual respect
for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-interference
in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit,
relations between China and the United States will enjoy a smooth
growth," said the minister.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on Sino-Russian relations, the foreign minister said
that such relations have been "developing very well".
</P>
<P>
China and Russia have kept contacts on major international
issues including issues on Iraq and Kosovo, and have maintained
consultations through the United Nations and bilateral channels,
he said, adding that "such contacts and consultations will
continue."
</P>
<P>
He revealed that Russian President Boris Yeltsin will pay a
visit to China later this year and hold talks with Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.

According to the foreign minister, China is prepared to make
further efforts to gain access to the World Trade Organization (
WTO).
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky paid a visit to
China several days ago and held talks with her Chinese counterpart
which produced important progress and were constructive, Tang
noted.
</P>
<P>
"But there are still important differences between the two
countries," he conceded.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has made considerable concessions in this
regard during the past decade, Tang described the talks and
negotiations between China and relevant parties as "marathon talks
".
</P>
<P>
"The only reason why the issue has not been settled so far is
that some countries disregard the fact that China is a developing
country and put too high demands on it, some of which are
exorbitant," he said.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question about Sino-Indian relations, the
foreign minister said that the joint work group on boundary
questions between China and India, whose work was suspended last
May after India conducted underground nuclear tests, will resume
its work soon.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Indian side will take concrete steps and make
positive efforts to enable our bilateral relations to return to
the track of normal development," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
He added that China welcomes efforts made by India and Pakistan
toward improving their relations.
</P>
<P>
"We urge both India and Pakistan to effectively implement the
UN Security Council's Resolution 1172," he said.
</P>
<P>
During the 90-minute press conference, the foreign minister
also answered questions about the return of Macao to its
motherland at the end of this year, his scheduled visit to four
Nordic countries and Germany later this month and China's
relations with Vatican.

Responding to a question by a Japanese reporter about Sino-
Japanese relations, Tang said that last year marked the 20th
anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty for Peace
and Friendship, and President Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to
Japan in the same year.
</P>
<P>
The most important achievement of Jiang's visit, he said, is
that the leaders of the two countries, through their meetings and
talks in Tokyo, had a very candid and in-depth exchange of views,
on all issues left over from history and on how to view and handle
them in a right way.
</P>
<P>
On issues left over from history, the two sides agreed on one
principle:"To take history as guide and look to the future."
</P>
<P>
"Only by correctly understanding and handling issues left over
from history can we open a future for Sino-Japanese relations,"
Tang said, adding that this is the "very important consensus"
reached by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister went on to say that China's relations with
the European Union and European countries are also developing very
well, but he also urged EU nations to stop trade protectionism
against China.
</P>
<P>
China and the European Union and European countries are not
only important trading partners, but also share many views and
hold similar positions on political and international affairs,
Tang noted.
</P>
<P>
He said China welcomes the launch of the Euro and hopes to see
the stability of the new currency.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile we urge European Union and European countries to
change their practice of trade protectionism against China," he
said. "We hope they will not start anti-dumping investigations
against China and will drop current anti-dumping investigations
against China."
</P>
<P>
On the human rights issue, the foreign minister said that,
despite some differences, China and the overwhelming majority of
European countries agree to pursue dialogues and stay away from
confrontation.

<HEADLINE> Government Advisors Voice Opinions on Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China should accelerate drafting
relevant laws and provide a fair competitive environment for the
non-publicly-owned sector, a government advisor said here today.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Hongwei, vice-chairman of All-China Federation of
Industry and Commerce and a member of the Ninth National Committee
of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC),
made the remark at a full session of the committee.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that many people still hold biased views against
the non-publicly -owned sector, which is growing fast despite
discriminative treatment it receives and its lack of legal
protection.
</P>
<P>
He called for the government to change policies on the non-
publicly-owned sector according to the country's Constitution to
be amended at the current session of the Chinese legislature.
</P>
<P>
Dong Fureng, a member of the CPPCC National Committee and a
well-known economist, said that China should improve its export
product mix by increasing the export of high-value-added products
and products that involve many economic activities.
</P>
<P>
He called for the government to invite non-state sectors to
enter bid for major infrastructure projects so as to kick start
investment in fixed assets by these sectors.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a member of the CPPCC National Committee and
professor of economy from Beijing University, said that China
should set up Sino-foreign joint-venture investment funds on a
trial basis and increase stock and bond issues on international
financial markets.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the government should loosen its monetary
policy to stimulate the economy and avoid deflation.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the financial sector to set up development
funds for small enterprises and risk funds for hi-tech industry.
</P>
<P>
He said that an important way to stimulate consumer demand lies
in increasing consumer credit.

<HEADLINE> Senior Israeli Official Leaves for France on Lebanese </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu sent his foreign policy adviser Uzi Arad to Paris
Sunday to discuss ways for Israel to withdraw from south Lebanon,
local TV reported.
</P>
<P>
This move came two days after Lebanese Prime Minister Salim
Hoss told the BBC that he would prevent guerrillas from
carrying out attacks on Israel if it pulls back its troops from
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Hoss said he would renew an armistice agreement signed with
Israel in 1949, which banned both sides from launching military
actions cross the border, after an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Although Hoss backtracked from the position several hours
after the BBC interview, saying his words had been taken out of
context and misunderstood, the Israeli government responded
positively to the reported remarks.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said Saturday, the Jewish Shabbat, that "if Lebanon
is serious about its recent suggestions, it will find in Israel a
willing partner."
</P>
<P>
The local daily Haaretz said Sunday that Netanyahu is
considering appealing officially to Hoss to begin immediate direct
negotiations on an Israeli withdrawal within months from south
Lebanon without the participation of Syria, the main power-broker
in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted a senior Likud source as saying that
Netanyahu would propose parallel talks with Beirut on a security
arrangement to protect Israel's northern border and to ensure the
future of the Israeli-allied South Lebanese Army.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanon issue has taken the central stage in Israel's
election campaign since seven Israelis including a
brigadier-general were killed in south Lebanon in less than a
week last month.
</P>
<P>
The killings have sparked a renewed public debate in Israel
over the wisdom of Israel's military presence in the so-called
security zone, a 15-kilometer deep border zone carved out by
Israel in 1985 with a declared aim of protecting its northern
areas.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls have showed that the number of Israelis favoring
a unilateral withdrawal from south Lebanon is increasing. But more
than 60 percent of Israelis still believe that a security
guarantee from Beirut is necessary before any Israeli withdrawals.
</P>
<P>
In a surprising move, opposition Labor leader Ehud Barak said
last week that he would get Israeli soldiers out of south Lebanon
within a year if he is elected prime minister in the May
elections.
</P>
<P>
Somewhat embarrassed by Barak's promise, Netanyahu quickly
responded that he would also be able to ensure an Israeli
withdrawal within a year.
</P>
<P>
Observers said Arad might ask France, a close ally of Lebanon,
to persuade Beirut to enter negotiation with Israel without the
involvement of Syria, who insists that the Lebanese track and
Syrian track can not be separated.
</P>
<P>
Damascus wants to use the issue of south Lebanon to press
Israel into concession over the Golan Heights, the Syrian
territory seized by Israel in 1967.

<HEADLINE> New Policy Governs Recruitment of Taiwan Students </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Education has
introduced a policy which allows two colleges in Fujian Province
to directly recruit students from Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Fujian representative Huang Changxi suggested the policy during
the Fourth Session of the 8th National People's Congress (NPC) in
March 1996.
</P>
<P>
Fujian College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Fujian Normal
University and a number of other colleges in the province have
enrolled an increasing number of students from Taiwan in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The previous policy required Taiwan students to complete the
National College Entrance Examination. The requirement hampered
recruitment efforts due to major differences in education systems.
</P>
<P>
Huang also suggested special examination to promote the
recruitment of Taiwan students in order to promote cross-Straits
exchanges.
</P>
<P>
The ministry issued the policy following three years of careful
deliberation by the NPC. Huang told deputies attending the ongoing
Second Session of the 9th National People's Congress that priority
will be placed on preparing for the next round of exams and
guaranteeing implementation of the program.
</P>
<P>
More than 2,000 Taiwan students currently attend colleges in
the Chinese mainland, with some 500 students attending colleges in
Fujian Province, which sees the Taiwan island across the Taiwan
Straits.

<HEADLINE> Marcello's Double Gives Shenhua Super Cup Victory </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MIANYANG, Sichuan Province, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Marcello's pair
gave League Cup winners Shanghai Shenhua a 3-0 cushion of last
season's champions Dalian Wanda to claim the Super Cup on Sunday
in the southeast city of China.
</P>
<P>
Marcello, tagged the best foreign player in the Chinese league,
scored twice within six minute late in the game.
</P>
<P>
He made it 2-0 for Shanghai Shenhua in the 80 minutes when he
tipped the ball into an empty net and finished the thrash with a
header with four minutes left.
</P>
<P>
In the 55 minutes, midfielder Wu Chengying broke Wanda's
defending line from the center after Marcello backheeled a through
ball to open the mark for Shenhua.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the two former league champions to
meet in the Super Cup match.
</P>
<P>
Wanda, four-times league champions, managed to stop Shenhua's
constant challenges in the frontcourt in the first half without
their top scorer Hao Haidong, who was banned by the Asian Football
Association for one year.
</P>
<P>
Wanda's head coach Xu Genbao used out his three substitutions
in 10 minutes after his team trailed 1-0 but that proved useless
to choke the sharp attacking force of Shenhua.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Supreme People's Court today
upheld death sentences for two Zhejiang farmers convicted of
issuing fake value-added tax (VAT) invoices valued at several
hundred million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Hu Yinfeng and Lu Huaming, were executed today in east China's
Zhejiang Province.
</P>
<P>
Hu, a resident of Yongkang city, was convicted of establishing
seven sham companies between June 1995 and December 1996. He
issued over 6,000 counterfeit VAT invoices worth over 640 million
yuan (77 million U.S. dollars) and fraudulently obtained over 89
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Lu, also from Yongkang, was convicted of opening a factory and
three sham companies between June 1995 and May 1996. He issued
over 2,300 counterfeit VAT invoices worth 1.8 million yuan and
engaged in fraud to amass over 26 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The two men appealed the death sentence handed down by the
Intermediate People's Court in Jinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Zhejiang Higher People's Court upheld the first instance
ruling and submitted the verdict to the Supreme People's Court for
approval.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: NPC Deputies' New Focal Point </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Amidst the lingering impact of the
Asian financial crisis and the general economic slowdown in the
neighboring countries, China has set eyes on its vast domestic
market, hoping to achieving this year's growth target by expanding
domestic demand.
</P>
<P>
Deputies to the ongoing 2nd session of the Ninth National
People's Congress and members of the Ninth National Committee of
the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference who are
here attending the annual sessions of the top lawmaking body and
the top government advisory body have expressed concerns over the
issue and offered suggestions for implementing the major economic
strategy.
</P>
<P>
They all agree that the central government decision to drive
the economic growth by expanding domestic demand is correct and
necessary since China's export, which has continued to slide
because of the weakened regional and world demands, can hardly
contribute to the economic growth this year as it did before.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, they said, it is sensible for the government to
continue pumping treasury funds and increase investment in capital
projects, especially the infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report delivered Friday at the NPC
session, Premier Zhu Rongji pledged a pro-active fiscal policy
which will expand this year's budget deficit by 54.3 billion yuan
to 150.3 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Yet to boost consumer spending and tap the vast individual bank
savings is no easy job.
</P>
<P>
Xiao Zhuoji, a noted economist and a CPPCC National Committee
member, said that people are reluctant to loose their purse string
these days as they have lowered their expectations for income
increase while anticipating more payment for their housing and
medical service as reforms on the welfare housing and health care
systems are going in depth.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, while there is almost a glut in supplies of
traditional household electric appliances like TV sets,
refrigerators and washing machines, the market lacks new and
modern gadgets to offer.
</P>
<P>
She Jianming, director of the Macro-Economic Research Institute
under the State Development Planning Commission and a CPPCC
National Committee member, said it is important to maintain growth
momentum in urban areas to increase the buying power of people
with low and middle incomes.
</P>
<P>
Relevant policies should be timely worked out to encourage more
people to buy consumer durables like housing and cars, She added.
</P>
<P>
Sun Ying, an NPC deputy from Gansu Province in northwest China,
said speeding up the construction of infrastructure projects in
the western area of China can boost domestic demand and help
develop regional economy as well.
</P>
<P>
Many NPC deputies and CPPCC National Committee members
emphasized the importance to tap the rural market. South
China's Guangdong Province and central China's Hubei Province have
decided to put in 4 billion yuan and 9 billion yuan respectively
in next three years to upgrade rural power grids.

<HEADLINE> Macao on Track of Smooth Return to China: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Macao is advancing along the road
of a smooth transition and a smooth return to its motherland, Wang
Qiren, director of Macao Branch of Xinhua News Agency, said here
today.
</P>
<P>
Macao's return to China has entered the countdown period: only
288 days are left for China to resume the exercise of sovereignty
over the region.
</P>
<P>
Attending the ongoing annual session of the Ninth National
People's Congress and the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference as both a member and a
deputy, Wang said the central government has attached great
importance to the return of Macao, which is reflected in President
Jiang Zemin's and Premier Zhu Rongji's in-depth speeches on Macao
during the sessions.
</P>
<P>
The return of Macao is of great historic significance since it
marks a complete ending for the foreign occupation of, and rule
over, pieces of Chinese territory, Wang said.
</P>
<P>
"It also represents another successful application of the grand
concept of 'one country, two systems' advanced by Deng Xiaoping.
It will further prove that the principle is scientific and correct.
" he said, adding that Macao's return to China will also
facilitate a final solution for the problem of Taiwan and achieve
a complete reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
Wang pointed out that Macao has now come to the final and most
crucial stage of its latter transitional period and that
preparatory work for the establishment of the Macao Special
Administrative Region (SAR) is in full swing.
</P>
<P>
"China and Portugal have maintained relations of good
cooperation on the issue of Macao, and some urgent issues are
still being actively discussed," Wang said. "Macao compatriots
have shown great enthusiasm for Macao's return to its motherland,
the formation of the Macao SAR and celebrations marking Macao's
return."
</P>
<P>
Wang quoted Premier Zhu's words to conclude his speech, saying
"with the successful experience from Hong Kong's return, active
participation by Macao compatriots, joint efforts from China and
Portugal, we will definitely have a smooth transition and transfer
of government in Macao."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Scientific and technological
renovations are playing an increasingly crucial role in economic
restructuring in China.
</P>
<P>
Deputies attending the Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress (NPC) and members attending the Second Session
of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) agreed that hi-tech industry has
become a new growing area of the economy.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China invested 450 billion yuan in new and hi-tech
industries, 36 percent more than in 1997.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy and Shenzhen Mayor Li Zibin said that rapid
commercialization of scientific and technological advances has
helped the south China city to resume growth momentum in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee member and Deputy Director of Beijing
Municipal Agricultural Bureau Yin Youqi said that scientific and
technological renovation has already played an important role in
boost agricultural output in China. He noted that technological
advances now contribute to over 46 percent of growth of
agriculture in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The new government has taken invigorating the nation through
science and education as the top task.
</P>
<P>
NPC deputy and General Manager of Chongqing Steel Group Company
Guo Daiyi said that enterprises should play the major role in
research and development so as to accelerate commercialization of
scientific and technological research results.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that only four percent of China's scientific and
technological research results are commercialized every year.
</P>
<P>
CPPCC National Committee member Yuan Guiren said that since
well trained talents are the core force of renovation and
commercialization of scientific and technological research results,
big efforts should be made to accelerate the development of
education.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is to add 2.6 billion yuan to education
budget and increase investment in science and technology by 820
million yuan this year.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Uganda Intensifies Efforts Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Feng Jian, Wang Shangzhi)
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Following the brutal killing of
eight foreign tourists in Bwindi Impenetrable Forest National
Park in southwestern Uganda by Rwanda's Interahamwe rebels early
Monday morning, the Ugandan government intensified efforts to
track and finally eliminate the gang of killers.
</P>
<P>
At about 6:30 a.m. on March 1, a gang of about 150 heavily
armed Rwandan Hutu rebels launched a surprise attack on foreign
tourists in the park who had booked in advance to try to get a
glimpse of the rare mountain gorillas in the forest which covers
more than 300 square kilometers.
</P>
<P>
They set fire to the vehicles belonging to the tourists and the
park authorities and abducted 32 people including Deputy French
Ambassador to Uganda Anne Peltier and the wife of the World Bank
chief in Uganda, Randolph Harris.
</P>
<P>
Anglo-Saxons are said to be their prime target because the
rebels said that Britain and the United States are backing the
Tutsi government of Rwanda. Four Britons, two Americans and two
New Zealanders are among the dead.
</P>
<P>
The attackers, part of those who killed more than 500,000
people in Rwanda in 1994, looted everything the abducted carried
and killed eight foreign tourists with matchetes and other blunt
weapons.
</P>
<P>
The murder sent shock waves to not only the countries whose
nationals were slaughtered but the whole international community,
inviting all the innocent people to direct their accusing finger
at the Hutu rebels.
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister Tony Blair described this incident as an
 appalling tragedy and an act of wickedness.
</P>
<P>
Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni has called a press conference
to condemn the criminal act of the rebels and vowed to avenge the
tourists' death.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the incident, the Ugandan army sent a battalion to
guard the park and to track the rebels. They have gone 40 kms deep
into Congo (K) land to hunt the killers. All the 10 national parks
of the country will be guarded by troops, Museveni said at the
press briefing.
</P>
<P>
So far 25 Hutu rebels, said to be among those who killed the
tourists, had been confirmed killed by the Rwandan and Uganda
forces.
</P>
<P>
Second division commander Benon Biraro said Saturday that
helicopters are always ready to transport more troops for the
hunting of the rebels if necessary.
</P>
<P>
To make the matter clear to the world as soon as possible,
Uganda has invited FBI agents and specialized British
investigators to look into the matter. They will establish how the
rebels carried out their acts of violence and whether the
kidnappers had any collaborators.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Bwindi Park, which is just five kms from the
border of the Democratic Republic of Congo, is closed and soldiers
are patrolling in it. The park authorities have also taken
effective measures against any possible attack.
</P>
<P>
They said the tented camps will be consolidated and security
checks will be done more seriously.
</P>
<P>
All these measures the Ugandan authorities have taken are
aimed to stop the rebels attack and to protect the country's
tourism industry.

<HEADLINE> Senior Israeli, Palestinian Officials to Meet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Defense Minister Moshe
Arens is expected to meet with senior Palestinian official
Mahmoud Abbas soon, Israel Radio reported on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Contacts are under way for the meeting, the radio quoted
Palestinian sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Abbas, known as Abu Mazen, is deputy to Palestinian National
Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be the first high-level talks between the two
sides since Israel froze the implementation of the Wye River
land-for-peace deal in December.
</P>
<P>
Citing alleged Palestinian violations of the agreement signed
in October, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu halted its
implementation in an attempt to win back support from his
right-wing coalition partners.
</P>
<P>
However, far-right wingers joined the opposition bloc in the
parliament in voting for moving up the national elections from
next year to May this year.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu offered a partial proposal later last month, saying
Israel is willing to carry out parts of the agreement in order to
revive the stalled peace process.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, Israel will release jailed Palestinian
criminals and open the southern route of the safe passage linking
Gaza and the West Bank, but will not carry out the troop
withdrawals stipulated in the peace deal.
</P>
<P>
The PNA rejected the idea, saying any proposal excluding the
territorial transfer, the core of the Wye agreement, is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials also dismissed Netanyahu's proposal as an
election ploy aimed at impressing the Israeli public, since most
of them support the peace process, while convincing the far-right
wingers that he will not make territorial concessions.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today
aired views on implementing the strategy of developing the
country by promoting advances in science and technology and by
developing education, calling for applying research results in
production and reforming the medical sector.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier aired his views in a group discussion attended
by deputies to the National People's Congress from Shandong
province.
</P>
<P>
He said that science and technology will develop by leaps and
bounds in the next century and that knowledge, especially
inventive knowledge, will become an increasingly important capital.
Knowledge and gifted personnel, the two most important forms of
capital, should be utilized to the best possible extent, he said.
</P>
<P>
Utilization of applied sciences must be accelerated, he said,
noting that except a small number of institutions in the research
of basic sciences, those engaged in studying applied sciences
should be turned into enterprises step by step.
</P>
<P>
Reform of the medical insurance system and restructuring of
hospitals should be carried out simultaneously, the vice premier
said. In future, patients should have a choice of hospitals and
can buy medicines in independent drug-stores, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to hospital sources, patients now have had to receive
medical diagnosis and purchase drugs in the same hospital. Many
abuses result from such practice.
</P>
<P>
The vice premier said that hospitals should be streamlined and
a number of hospital groups should be set up in the country, while
efforts should be made to optimize the allocation of medical
personnel and equipment and to enhance the ethics of hospital
workers.

<HEADLINE> Soldiers Arrested in Raids on Neo-Nazis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Fifteen people, including two
soldiers, have been arrested in Britain in raids across the
country against Combat 18, a neo-Nazi group with a long history of
violence, by the police and security service.
</P>
<P>
Search warrants had been executed on Friday "to seek material
including CDs and publications that are suspected of contravening
part three of the Public Order Act 1986, which concerns acts
intended or likely to stir up racial hatred", a BBC report quoted
a Scotland Yard spokeswoman as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Sunday Telegraph newspaper reports that the two arrested
soldiers came from the elite Parachute and King's regiments. There
were also suspicions that they were involved in offering military
expertise to terrorists in Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
The internal security service known as MI5, Special Branch and
the Military Police were all involved in the long-term inquiry
into neo-Nazi attempts to infiltrate the army. They raided 14
houses in London, Lancashire, Merseyside, Kent, Thames Valley,
Humberside, West Yorkshire, and south Wales. The two soldiers were
arrested at Bulford in Wiltshire and Preston in Lancashire.
</P>
<P>
Apart from any sentence if found guilty of illegal activities
with Combat 18, the soldiers would face almost certain dismissal
from the army.
</P>
<P>
Combat 18, which is said to take its name from Adolf Hitler's
initials, the first and eighth letter of the alphabet, has in the
past been blamed for other illegal activity. It was said to have
orchestrated hooligans to disrupt the England versus Ireland
football match in 1995 and sent letter bombs to mixed race couples.
</P>
<P>
The British Ministry of Defense has said it will not tolerate
racism in the army after the two soldiers' arrests.

Channel Television will broadcast current news items from Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda, local newspaper Sunday Observer said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Reginald Mengi, Executive Chairman of the IPP Group which owns
the ITV made the suggestion Saturday while meeting with visiting
the Managing Director of the Kenya Broadcasting Corporation,
Simeon Anabwani.
</P>
<P>
Mengi said the establishment of such a channel would help
reduce the dependency on western news agencies by the three member
states of the East African Cooperation (EAC).
</P>
<P>
"We could shrug off this dependency by starting to co-operate
in the exchange of news items between ourselves,!1 he said.
</P>
<P>
Mengi suggested that current news and information could be
broadcast in a rotational form, with specific bulletins about each
of the three countries, Uganda, Kenya, and Tanzania in turns.
</P>
<P>
Anabwani, the KBC head, said that co-operation between the two
media institutions could be vital in strengthening East African
Co-operation, thus furthering the common interests of all the
people in the region.
</P>
<P>
Anabwani said that a good current example of the spirit of
co-operation between ITV and KBC, was the recent appearance on Dar
es Salaams TV screens of the Kenyan, Kiswahili language soap
opera, Tausi, which is produced by KBC.
</P>
<P>
He said KBC Radio can reaches 90 percent of the Kenyan
population and its programs are currently broadcast in 21
different languages.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Cabinet Okays Formation of Security Council </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Israeli cabinet on Sunday
approved a proposal for the formation of the National Security
Council (NSC) to deal with the country's security issues.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told his ministers that the
NSC will be formed only after the May 17 elections, said a cabinet
statement.
</P>
<P>
Defense Minister Moshe Arens and Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon
had already shown their support for the proposal, drafted by a
team led by David Ivri.
</P>
<P>
Ivri, the leading candidate to head the new body, adopted the
British model of a streamlined council that would back up the work
of governmental departments.
</P>
<P>
The NSC will be missioned with coordinating the work of all
relevant government agencies to deal with complex
interdisciplinary national security problems.
</P>
<P>
The formation of such a council had been denied by former
defense minister Yitzhak Mordechai, who said in the past that the
existing military intelligence organizations were enough to deal
with Israel's security issues.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's decision to delay the NSC formation was based on
the uncertainties before the elections, said political analysts.
</P>
<P>
And senior officers would hesitate to join the council on the
eve of the elections for fear that the new government or defense
minister would reverse the tide and nullify the decision, analysts
added.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Leader Stresses Views of People </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Leading officials at all levels in
China should listen to the views of the people in their work
because whatever they do is for the sake of the people and they
are best qualified to assess the performance of the officials, a
senior Chinese leader said here today.
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), top government
advisory body, said this when deliberating a government work
report by Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji at the ongoing 2nd Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) with deputies from
north China's port city of Tianjin attending the NPC session.
</P>
<P>
To a certain extent, Li said, reform is a readjustment of
interests of different groups of people and therefore, must
benefit the majority of the people, and at the same time, ensure
that the life of the minority whose interests are temporarily
harmed is guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
Hence, it is important to listen to the people's views about
what measures to be taken in the reform, said the CPPCC leader who
is also a member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Though China has achieved internationally acknowledged
successes, there are still difficulties and problems ahead and to
solve these problems and overcome the difficulties, leading
officials at all levels should go among the people and get their
suggestions and then work out the correct ways to overcome the
difficulties, he said, stressing that "this is a fundamental way
out."
</P>
<P>
"The people are the real heros and they have the best practical
experience," and "all genuine knowledge comes from practice," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that he agrees to what Premier Zhu Rongji said in the
government work report, which reflects the guidelines of the 15th
CPC National Congress convened in 1997 and of the 3rd Plenum of
the 15th CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
"It is a practical and good report," he said, adding that "we
should take earnest measures to implement it after it is approved"
at the current NPC session.

<TEXT>
<P>
The Permanent Secretary in the Ministry of Education and
Culture Abubakari Rajabu, quoted by local newspapers Sunday, has
said that it has been found that some schools in the country are
contrary to government expectations.
</P>
<P>
!0Some individuals and institutions have completely distorted
the main objective of the liberalization policy to the extent that
they have forgotten to serve the national interest,!1 Rajabu told
a press conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said the government will closely assess the validity of all
the international schools in the country, warning that legal
measures would be taken against those lacking international
education standards.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu emphasized that his ministry was not interested in the
mushrooming of the international schools which hardly served the
education purpose of the country.
</P>
<P>
"The Government is not interested in the quantity, it is
interested in the quality," he said.
</P>
<P>
The permanent secretary said some schools in the country have
been called "international" in order to attract parents, but
academically, there is nothing international about them.
</P>
<P>
Rajabu also stressed that his ministry will continue support
individuals and institutions that are committed to contributing to
the country's education development.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is planning to establish a new education
system which would prepare Tanzanians to be self reliant and
relevant to the efforts towards eradicating poverty in the
country.
</P>
<P>
He said some donors have already indicated willingness to
assist the new education system and his ministry has proposed an
increase of the government budget to education.

</P>
<P>
Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie and Romania's Gabriela Szabo also

the record of 3:03.05 set by Germany at the 1991 championships.
</P>
<P>
Russia's women quartet, including Tatyana Chebykina, Svetlana
Goncharenko, Olga Kotlyarova and Natalya Nazarova, was timed in 3:
24.25, breaking the old record of 3:26.84 set by another Russian
team at the 1997 championships.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie, who won the 3,000m on Friday, claimed the victory
in the men's 1,500m while Szabo added her 1,500 title on Saturday
with a 3,000m gold.

history of the biennial championships was Germany's Hieke
Drechsler in 1987, who took the women's 200 and long jump.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie overtook Kenya's Laban Rotich, whom he trailed all
the way in the race, within the last six meters to finish 3:33.77.

<HEADLINE> "We Must Look Ahead Positively" : Says Nigerian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President-elect General
Olusegun Obasanjo has pledged to forgive past mistakes, saying
"we must look ahead positively" and work hard to create conditions
for national unity and stability of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo made the assurance Saturday in Kaduna, northeastern
Nigeria, at the launching of General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua
Foundation, reported the Sunday Punch.
</P>
<P>
He noted that he must forgive past mistakes if the nation must
move forward, adding "This is not the time to look back in anger
or bitterness, we cannot even afford to waste valuable time on
contemplating vendetta."
</P>
<P>
"We must look ahead positively and work hard to ensure that the
 essential Yar'Adua evolves into a major national institution for
promoting the ideals of democracy, national unity and good
governance," Obasanjo said.
</P>
<P>
General Shehu Musa Yar'Adua, second-in-command of the Obasanjo
 administration in 70s, was imprisoned on the alleged charges of
coup plotting by the Abacha regime and died in prison in December
1997.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo noted that Yar'Adua was a genuine patriot and
nationalist to the core, adding he put in everything to fight
against the disintegration of the country during the civil war
from 1967 to 1970.
</P>
<P>
"He believed in good governance, democracy and federalism as
necessary conditions for the unity and stability of Nigeria," the
president-elect emphasized.
</P>
<P>
Obasanjo said: "Yar'Adua displayed a remarkable ability to
build political bridges across different cleavages that are the
realities of Nigeria."
</P>
<P>
Late General Yar'Adua was granted pardon last Thursday by the
General Abubakar government together with Oladipo Diya, former
chief of general staff.

<HEADLINE> NPC Deputies on Expanding Consumer Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- How to effectively expand consumer
demand has been a focus of discussions for deputies attending the
ongoing second session of the Ninth National People's Congress
here.
</P>
<P>
In his government work report to the annual session of the
nation's legislature, Premier Zhu Rongji called for adopting more
concrete measures to activate consumer demand, complementing
government efforts in increasing investment demand and thereby
stimulating the economy to grow by seven percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
"While investment demand expansion continues to accelerate, the
government should exploit more areas for consumption, exert
greater efforts to increase consumer demand, improve the supply of
goods and achieve a supply and demand balance." according to Shi
Liwen, an entrepreneur deputy from Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shi's views are shared by many other NPC deputies, who agree
that only a complete and comprehensive set of measures can create
new hot areas for consumption, given people's income disparities,
differences in the consumption environment and the huge market
potential.
</P>
<P>
Yu Guangzhou, mayor of Xuzhou in Jiangsu, said people are the
primary source of consumer demand, saying that his city focuses on
accelerating the construction of commercial housing with a total
of 1.45 million square meters in floor space completed last year
alone that cater to medium- and low-income residents.
</P>
<P>
Yu called for strengthened government supervision over pricing
and the charge of fees in the real estate sector, increasing bank
loans to the sector and encouraging more people to buy apartments.
</P>
<P>
Chen Zuoyi, a deputy from China Zhi Gong Party, pointed out
that the rural market should be fully tapped considering its huge
potential.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that rural Chinese lag behind urban
residents in consumer spending to a far greater extent than the
disparity in their incomes justifies.
</P>
<P>
A businessman deputy named Dong Weiping said that backward
infrastructure in rural areas prevents many rural households from
buying electrical appliances, and that upgraded infrastructure can
activate rural consumer spending and improve the lives of farmers.
</P>
<P>
To activate consumption, deputies also proposed improving the
pricing system, adjusting the interest rates of bank deposits,
introducing credit buying, and improving the social security
system.

to welcome the new millennium, marking the beginning of Millennium
celebrations in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The launch of the clock, set up on the exterior of Times Square,
a major shopping mall in Hong Kong, was co-organized by the Wharf
Group, the owner of the mall, and the Hong Kong Red Cross as the
year 2000 coincides with the 50th anniversary of the Hong Kong Red
Cross.
</P>
<P>
Since the opening of Times Square in 1993, the annual countdown
event on New Year's Eve has been one of the most popular events
for Hong Kong people to welcome in the new year.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion, the Hong Kong Red Cross announced a campaign
to serve the community in the 300 days running up to the year 2000
with the aim of encouraging the general public to participate and
achieve three service targets: to train 2,000 first aiders; to
recruit 20,000 new blood donors; and to accumulate 200,000 service
hours.
</P>
<P>
In the past five decades, the Hong Kong Red Cross has devoted
to serving the community by recruiting and providing safe blood to
the patients; providing education to handicapped children and
youth; rendering aid to disaster victims and training and
mobilizing volunteers to serve the needy.

<P>
DHAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- At least six persons, including a
woman, were killed and 75 others were injured in two bomb blasts
at a musical concert in Southwest Bangladesh early Sunday morning,
reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
Police said two powerful bombs, which were hidden behind the
open stage at the Jessore Town Hall Premises in Jessore District,
some 146 kilometers southwest of here, exploded between 1:15 and

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on Chinese-Indian Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan announced that the joint work group on boundary questions
between China and India will resume its work soon after the
suspension of the group's work last May when India conducted
underground nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
Tang made the remark at a press conference sponsored here this
afternoon by the ongoing session of the Chinese legislature, the
National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the Indian side will take concrete steps and make
positive efforts to enable our bilateral relations to return to
the track of normal development," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"Not long ago, officials of foreign ministries of China and
India made useful discussions and held useful talks in Beijing,"
Tang said.
</P>
<P>
"For a long time," Tang said, "China has made unremitting
efforts to improve its relations with India."
</P>
<P>
"Recently we have noticed that the leaders of India have on
several occasions made public statements, expressing their wish to
improve relations with China," the minister said. "They have also
repeatedly said that at present India does not regard China as a
threat to India."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said that China welcomes efforts made by
India and Pakistan toward improving their relations.
</P>
<P>
On the question of nuclear testing, Tang said, "We urge both
India and Pakistan to effectively implement the UN Security
Council's Resolution 1172."
</P>
<P>
China pursues an independent foreign policy of peace and stands
ready to develop friendly relations and cooperation with all
countries in the world, particularly with neighboring countries,
on the basis of the five principles of peaceful co-existence, Tang
said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Pupils Will Have Time to Enjoy Themselves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Primary school pupils are now able
to get rid of their heavy school bags after class and enjoy
themselves as they like.
</P>
<P>
"Children are entitled to play after school, for this is just
part of their life, and only in this way can children show
continuous interest in their schooling," said Liu Zhiyong, who is
in charge of educational affairs in a primary school in Dalian in
northeast China's Liaoning Province.
</P>
<P>
The school bags of primary students are becoming heavier as
teachers and parents pay more attention to their school grades.
</P>
<P>
It is quite common for these school bags to weigh several
kilograms on average, and some weigh as many as six kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Some students have to do their homework deep into the night.
However endless homework does not necessarily make for good
students. Children's physical and psychological and moral well-
being must also be taken into account. Many pupils nowadays do not
even know how to do simple daily housework.
</P>
<P>
"We made some reforms in our teaching, such as attaching more
importance to Chinese, mathematics, shortening the length of class
periods, and requiring teachers to change their teaching methods
in order to leave more time for children to study on their own and
enjoy themselves." said Liu.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Dalian abolished the 100-point evaluation system two
years ago, and the children are now given a comprehensive
appraisal according to their performances in various fields. Along
with this, many schools have set up hobby clubs for children to
develop their own interest and specialties.
</P>
<P>
Most parents are satisfied with these changes. "My child now
has more spare time to learn something that he is interested in,
which I think is quite helpful for children's growth," said Liu
Hongying, the mother of one six-grade pupil.

<HEADLINE> Fake ID Scam Exposed in S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A shocking fake ID scam by
South African home affairs officials was exposed by the Sunday
Times newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The head of the country's busiest home affairs office in
Johannesburg fled and locked himself in a parking basement
Saturday when confronted with proof of wide-scale ID documents
fraud in his department.
</P>
<P>
A Sunday Times team presented Dumisani Buthelezi, acting
regional representative for the Department of Home Affairs in
Johannesburg, with an ID document bought by a reporter posing as
an illegal alien.
</P>
<P>
Buthelezi and his deputy, Ben Makgalemela, refused to answer
questions and ran down a flight of stairs into the basement and
locked the door.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone interview 15 minutes later, Buthelezi confessed
that he was linked to the sale of ID documents.
</P>
<P>
The dramatic confrontation followed a three-week investigation
which found that new temporary and permanent ID documents were
being sold illegally by officials in the home affairs office in
downtown Johannesburg.
</P>
<P>
The documents can be used for voter registration, undermining
the government's huge drive for a fraud-free election, the paper
said. They can also be used to open a bank account and buy
property.

<HEADLINE> Li Peng on Three Gorges Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Three Gorges Project, the
world's largest hydropower and water conservancy project, provides
a golden opportunity for southwest China's Chongqing Municipality
to promote local economic prosperity, Li Peng, chairman of the
Standing Committee of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
the Chinese legislature, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"Without the Three Gorges Project, Chongqing wouldn't have
attained such a rapid development as today's," Li, also a Standing
Committee member of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee, told Chongqing deputies to the NPC
during a group discussion on Premier Zhu Rongji's Government Work
Report this morning.
</P>
<P>
Li praised Chongqing, which became China's fourth centrally-
administered municipality in 1997, for the great progress it has
achieved over the past two years, as well as for the city's
effective efforts in relocating more than one million local people
to make way for the gigantic Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze
River.
</P>
<P>
"Our principle is to make the relocation endeavor an
opportunity for promoting economic growth in the Three Gorges
region and for improving the lives of all relocated people," said
Li. "And I believe that with concerted efforts of the local people
and officials and with assistance from the rest of the country,
relocation work will continue to develop smoothly."
</P>
<P>
He went on to stress the importance of providing a basic living
standard guarantee for workers laid off from state-owned
enterprises in Chongqing, a major industrial base in southwest
China.
</P>
<P>
"Ensuring a basic living standard for laid-off workers and
helping them to find new jobs is an issue which has a bearing on
the overall situation," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He finally expressed the hope that Chongqing people would work
hard with one heart and one mind to score new successes in
developing the Three Gorges Project and promoting the local
economy.
</P>
<P>
Before Li spoke, some Chongqing NPC deputies voiced their
opinions on issues ranging from enterprise reform to higher
education development.

<HEADLINE> China Must Concentrate on Economic Development: Hu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- State Vice-President Hu Jintao
said China must concentrate on developing its economy since
economic strength is the most fundamental and the most important
for a country.
</P>
<P>
Hu, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee Political Bureau,
made the remark here today while taking part in a group discussion
on Premier Zhu Rongji's government work report attended by
deputies to the National People's Congress from Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, China made new progress in reform, opening up and
modernization of the country under complicated domestic and
international circumstances by overcoming a host of difficulties,
Hu said. It shows that a series of major decisions made by the
central authorities are completely correct, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Party Central Committee is a collective leadership with
Jiang Zemin at the core, which can cope with complicated
situations and is strong and decisive, and the Chinese nation has
a strong cohesive force and is very creative, he said.
</P>
<P>
Hu spoke highly of the economically underdeveloped province in
southwest China for the achievements it made last year. He urged
local officials to suit central policies to local realities in
developing the local economy.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Power Construction Proceeds Quickly in Tibet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Tibet has completed power supply
construction worth four billion yuan (482 million U.S. dollars)
since 1990, with over three billion yuan from the central
government, and its installed capacity now totals 310,000
kilowatts.
</P>
<P>
The largest power station of this plateau region -- the Yanghu
Pumped-Storage Power Station with 90,000 kilowatts in installed
capacity -- went on line at the end of last year. The two-billion-
yuan facility has the country's biggest head drop of 840 meters.
</P>
<P>
Under an ambitious blueprint, the region will bring electricity
to all of its counties by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The progress made in power construction in Tibet has been no
easy job, considering that before 1959 there was no electricity at
night even in the capital of Lhasa, forcing the local people to
rely on butter lamps for illumination.
</P>
<P>
Actually, the former Tibetan government built a 92-kilowatt
power station in Lhasa in 1936 to provide power to the residence
of Dalai lama and temples but the power station had stopped
production before the peaceful liberation of Tibet in 1959.

3 percent of the municipal gross domestic product (GDP) last year.
The municipal government plans to increase the share to 10 percent

To encourage home buying, Shanghai has in recent years
repeatedly reduced the interest rates on housing loans and
extended mortgages from 15 to 20 years.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Shanghai reduced down payments for houses from 30 to
20 percent and scaled back attendant fees and taxes.

<HEADLINE> FATF Praises HK for Combating Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) on Money Laundering, an international recognized pre-
eminent world body, praised Hong Kong for building an effective
anti-money laundering regime.
</P>
<P>
This comment was contained in a report on the second FATF's
mutual evaluation on Hong Kong, which was discussed at an FATF
plenary meeting in Paris in February.
</P>
<P>
FATF was established by the G-7 Summit in 1989 to examine
measures to combat money laundering.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong, which has been an FATF member since 1990, was
evaluated by the FATF for the second time in 1998. The first was
conducted in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The report on the second mutual evaluation on the Hong Kong
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) describes the expansion and
strengthening of the HKSAR's anti-money laundering legislation
under both the Drug Trafficking Ordinance and the Organized and
Serious Crimes Ordinance as having provided a solid foundation for
penal action against money laundering activities.
</P>
<P>
The report also notes Hong Kong's continuous efforts in
improving its money laundering regime, law enforcement agencies on
their proactive work in alerting money changers and remittance
agents of the need to take anti-money laundering measures.

<HEADLINE> Oil Drilling Threatens to Pollute Gulf of Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Environmentalists warned here
Sunday that petroleum drilling in neighboring waters threatened to
affect marine life in the Gulf of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The environmentalists, who raised the alarm at a seminar on
pollution, said offshore gas production units have discharged
mercury-contaminated water into the Gulf of Thailand resulting in
the increase of this heavy metal in fish around platforms.
</P>
<P>
They said Thailand's Chulalongkorn University scientists have
detected a high level of mercury in sea water suspected to come
from neighboring waters.
</P>
<P>
Such an incident could occur with other gas production units in
Cambodian and Vietnamese waters unless preventive measures were
implemented, said Piamsak Menasveta, director of Thailand's
Aquatic Resources Research Institute.
</P>
<P>
Some fish species such as mackerel inhabit Vietnamese waters
but have to migrate to the Gulf of Thailand to lay eggs. The
species are caught as food by Thai people, Piamsak said.
</P>
<P>
The latest report of ARRI showed less contamination in fish
around the platforms after the largest petroleum concession in the
Gulf of Thailand implemented measures to curb pollution.
</P>
<P>
The main source of mercury offshore is from the petroleum
industry, Piamsak said.

<HEADLINE> S. Lankan Exports to Slow Down Further This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Although Sri Lanka managed to
avoid the worst effects of the Asia and Russian crises, its export
growth slowed down sharply in 1998 and is seen falling further
this year, economists and stock brokers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released by the central bank last week revealed that
exports in 1998 grew by just 2.1 percent to 306.329 billion rupees
(4.73 billion U.S. dollars) over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The growth in 1998 exports was in marked contrast to that in
1997 when exports rose 14 percent, said central bank economists,
adding that the slowdown was mainly because prices of Ceylon tea,
the island's main commodity export, had fallen sharply.
</P>
<P>
Tea prices hit record highs in the early part of last year, but
fell sharply after August following the devaluation of the ruble
by Russia, the biggest buyer of Ceylon tea.
</P>
<P>
Tea exports which constituted around 70 percent of total
agricultural exports are expected to further decline in 1999 due
to higher global supply and the effect of the Russian contagion
continuing through 1999, brokers here said.
</P>
<P>
They said the island's export growth is expected to slow down
further in 1999 to a moderate 0.5 percent owing to the global
economic downturn.
</P>
<P>
However, government economists said Sri Lanka would do well to
post even moderate growth when several countries, including the
former Asian "Tiger" economies, were showing negative growth.
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown in exports, the island's trade gap
narrowed last year because of lower import costs following lower
prices for key imports such as petroleum products, wheat and
sugar.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Raid Hezbollah Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes Sunday morning
blasted suspected bases of Lebanon's military group Hezbollah
near Beirut, the Orient radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The planes fired air-to-surface missiles at the group's
suspected base at Naameh, 16 kilometers south of Beirut, the
radio said, adding there is no immediate report of casualties
from the air strike.
</P>
<P>
Israeli planes also staged a series of mock raids over Beirut,
the southern town of Nabatieh and Iqlim Toufaih area, which are
believed to be hideouts for Hezbollah guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
The air strike came at a time when the tensions in south
Lebanon remain high as a result of continued heavy losses the
Israeli forces suffered recently in their conflicts with Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
Last month, a total of seven Israelis, including a general,
were killed in south Lebanon in less than a week.
</P>
<P>
Israel has threatened to launch a large-scale offensive against
Hezbollah bases in retaliation while it is trying to find out a
solution for a withdrawal from the quagmire in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Israel set up a self-proclaimed security zone in south Lebanon
in 1985 with the claimed aim of protecting its north from
Lebanese guerrillas' cross-border attacks.
</P>
<P>
Since then, Lebanon's resistance movement spearheaded by the
Iranian-backed Hezbollah, or Party of God, has been fighting to
drive Israeli troops out of the country.
</P>
<P>
Israel has offered to withdraw its troops from the border
enclave on condition that the Lebanese government agrees to make a
promise first to prevent its north from Hezbollah's attacks after
the pullout.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria, a main power broker in Lebanon, rejected
the offer, asking Israel to leave the country without any
conditions.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- While promoting the reforms,
opening up and socialist modernization drive, China must make
greater efforts to ensure social stability, a senior Chinese
official said here today.
</P>
<P>
Wei Jianxing, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) Central
Committee, made the remark while discussing, with deputies from
the northeast China province of Heilongjiang, a government work
report delivered by Premier Zhu Rongji at the Second Session of
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), which opened here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
China's political and economic situation is quite good, which
is characterized by the social and political stability, Wei said.
"But," he added, "we must keep sober-minded because there are a
few factors affecting the stability and some are very protruding."
</P>
<P>
While keeping a close eye on and cracking down on sabotages by
hostile forces at home and abroad as well as maintaining the
public security through "strike-hard" campaigns, efforts should be
made to handle the contradictions within the people properly, so
as to safeguard political stability and unity, according to Wei,
who is also a member of the CPC Central Committee Secretariat.
</P>
<P>
He called on all institutions and grass-roots Party
organizations to consult the masses before making major decisions
and taking important measures which involve the interests of the
people.
</P>
<P>
Socialist democracy should be brought into full play in grass-
roots units including factories and villages, he said, stressing
that leaders of money-losing factories who continue to lead an
extravagant life and abuse their power for their own sake must be
punished.
</P>
<P>
Leading officials at all levels should keep close ties with the
people and non-government groups and help them solve problems at
an early stage, and they must not resort to means of dictatorship
in handling the contradictions within the people, he stressed.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Women now make up 41.8 percent of
the workforce of state-owned and collective enterprises in
Shanghai, China's economic and commercial center, official figures
show.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's state-owned and collective enterprises have a total
of some 1.82 million female employees, 41.8 percent of all workers,
according to Meng Yan, chairperson of Shanghai Municipal Women's
Federation.
</P>
<P>
Employment has become the major channel through which women in
Shanghai are participating in social construction and realizing
economic independence and self development, she said.
</P>
<P>
An analysis indicates that women account for nearly half the
payroll of the service sector including finance,
telecommunications, trade, and real estate, Meng said.
</P>
<P>
She added that women have also become a large proportion of the
employees of private firms.
</P>
<P>
Women are also represented in the leadership of 70 percent of
the 2,000-plus enterprises surveyed by the Shanghai Municipal
Trade Union, Meng said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, she noted that women's rights and interests, such as
a 3-month-long leave after giving birth, are well protected in
Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> FM Denounces Splittist Activities by Taiwan Authorities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China's Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan denounced splittist activities by the Taiwan authorities
here today at a press conference sponsored by the ongoing annual
session of National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about the possibility of the two
sides across the Taiwan Strait reaching a "diplomatic truce," Tang
said, "The current situation, to put it frankly, reflects that the
Taiwan authorities still cling stubbornly to the practice of
creating 'one China, one Taiwan' by expanding its international
space and pursue splittist activities."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the return of Hong Kong and the upcoming return of
Macao to their motherland, the foreign minister said, " A complete
re-unification of the motherland cannot be delayed indefinitely.
It represents the common and strong aspiration of all Chinese
people including Taiwan compatriots."
</P>
<P>
He added that whether or not a "diplomatic truce" can be
reached between the two sides depends on whether or not the Taiwan
authorities would continue activities aimed at splitting China and
whether or not they would take concrete measures to promote mutual
exchanges between the two sides.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels to Release Captive General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A National Democratic Front (NDF)
peace negotiator said Sunday that his group is prepared to release
"at any time" the three military and police officers held captive
by the group, raising hopes for the resumption of the formal peace
talks between the government and the rebel group.
</P>
<P>
NDF peace panelist Fidel Agcaoli said in a radio program that
the rebels want to discuss the basis and the procedure of the
release of Army Brig. Gen. Victor Obillo, his aide Capt. Eduardo
Montealto and Police Chief Inspector Roberto Bernal.
</P>
<P>
Agcaoli said there should be "clear basis and procedure" for
the release of the captives for their own safety as well as the
rebel forces that are involved.
</P>
<P>
Agcaoli's statement came in the heels of the President
Estrada's disclosure on his own radio-TV program that he has
received feelers on the release of the abducted military and
police officers.
</P>
<P>
President Estrada said the abductions will not be tolerated and
the formal peace talks will only resume if the rebels release the
three abducted officers unharmed.
</P>
<P>
NPA guerrillas abducted Obillo and Montealto in Davao City on
February 17, and Bernal in Sorsogon five days later.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Chinese FM on Sino-Japanese Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua)-- "I don't think the Sino-Japanese
relations have been affected because of historical issues after
President Jiang Zemin's state visit to Japan," Chinese Foreign
Minister Tang Jiaxuan said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Responding to a question on Sino-Japanese relations by a
Japanese reporter, Tang Jiaxuan said at a press conference
sponsored by the current session of the Ninth National People's
Congress that last year marked the 20th anniversary of the signing
of the Sino-Japanese Treaty for Peace and Friendship. President
Jiang Zemin paid a state visit to Japan the same year.
</P>
<P>
The most important achievement of his visit, he said, is the
leaders of the two countries, through the their meetings and talks
in Tokyo, had a very candid and in-depth exchange of views, on all
the historical issues and how to view and handle them in a right
way.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's visit, he said, China and Japan reached the
agreement on the framework for the development of the trans-
century Sino-Japanese relationship. The two sides announced and
agreed to define the future Sino-Japanese relations as "a
partnership for friendship and cooperation for peace and
development".
</P>
<P>
On the historical issues, the two sides agreed on one principle:
"To take history as the guidance and look into the future."
</P>
<P>
"Only by having a understanding of correctly handling the
historical issues, can we open a future for Sino-Japanese
relations," he said, adding that this is the "very important
consensus" reached by the two sides.
</P>
<P>
At present, he said, the most important follow-up activities or
the most important common task for China and Japan is to fully
materialize the principles and agreements reached between the two
sides during President Jiang Zemin's visit so as to promote the
continuous and constant development of Sino-Japanese relations.
</P>
<P>
The agreements include the exchange program between the young
people of China and Japan, the long and medium-term cooperation in
the area of environmental protection and hi-technologies."

<HEADLINE> Jordan`s New Government Declares War on Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Jordan`s new government headed by
Prime Minister Abdul Raouf Rawabdeh has declared a war on water
fraud and poverty in the desert kingdom one day after it came to
power.
</P>
<P>
In the first cabinet meeting Saturday, Rawabdeh put water,
poverty, unemployment and measures to attract investments at the
top of his priorities, and ordered the formation of 10 different
committees to tackle the issues.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, a veteran politician sworn in as prime minister on
Friday, pledged to solve in the following weeks the water crisis,
which is sweeping the desert kingdom due to a dragging drought
and rampant water fraud and leakage.
</P>
<P>
Half of the water consumed by Jordan were rain falls, with the
rest provided by Israel under the 1994 peace treaty, under which
the Jewish state pledged to provide 215 million cubic meters of
water a year.
</P>
<P>
Jordan is currently receiving only 60 million cubic meters a
year from Israel.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh, a staunch defender for the peace treaty with Israel,
is expected to pressure the Jewish state to abide by the water
clauses in the peace treaty.
</P>
<P>
Jordan, with an annual population growth rate of 3.5 percent,
would need 1.2 billion cubic meters of water a year between the
year 1998 to 2000, while its resources could only amount to 960
million cubic meters.
</P>
<P>
The water conditions worsened due to water fraud and leakage
from the ageing dams and pipelines across the kingdom, and half
of the drinking water in the the capital of Amman leaked into the
ground, experts said.
</P>
<P>
Rawabdeh also inherited from his predecessor Fayez Tarawaneh
a stagnant economic growth, a two-digit unemployment rate, low
efficiency and rampant corruption while over half of the 4.5
million population are living under poverty lines.
</P>
<P>
These problems were attributed to the recession of the world
economy, falling oil prices in the Gulf states and the failure of
friendly nations to translate their financial aid pledges into
concrete action.

BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- For the past five decades, the
Chinese women have been developed an image of self-confidence,
self-respect, self-improvement, and independence worldwide by the
means of increasing contacts overseas and through active
international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Feng Cui, a member of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF), told Xinhua today that this year's
International Women's Day is particularly significant for the
Chinese women because of the 89th anniversary Of the Women's Day
and the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the ACWF had forged ties with more than 550
children's and women's organizations in over 140 countries and
regions and co-operative projects with various international
organizations like the UNDP, UNICEF, and Canadian and Australian
international development programs.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, new, substantial progress was scored in overseas
contacts, Feng said, pointing to the more than 200 representatives
from 28 countries and regions who gathered in Beijing in June to
evaluate the situation of the Chinese women three years after the
Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. The conscientious
implementation of the Beijing Declaration and related agreements
have played an important role in improving the status of the women
in China, he added.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, women's delegations from China and the
European Union (EU) had held extensive discussions on human rights,
women's efforts in alleviation of poverty, and their role in
economic development and participation in politics. After a visit
to a number of neighborhood communities in Beijing and factories
and villages in and around Tianjin, these women's delegations
praised the Chinese women for their frankness in airing views
about human rights issues as well as their efforts to improve
their status.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan warned the United States not to "backtrack" on its
relations with China on the question of human rights issues.
</P>
<P>
He said this at a press conference here this afternoon in the
Great Hall of the People, which was sponsored by the current
session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
In response to CNN, he said: If somebody attempts to table an
anti-China draft resolution on human rights again this year in
Geneva, I think the outcome will not be different from the
previous seven times.
</P>
<P>
The CNN reporter said in her question that the U.S. is planning
to table a draft resolution against China at the coming session of
the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva this year.
</P>
<P>
Tang reiterated what he said to U.S. State Secretary Madeleine
Albright last week at the press conference.
</P>
<P>
"On the question of human rights, there will be no way out to
replace dialogue with confrontation. And to backtrack on this
issue will have no future," he said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that in January, China has resumed human rights dialogue
with the U.S. which had been suspended for four years, he said
that this dialogue is "helpful and useful."
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China has always stood for expanding common
ground and narrowing differences through dialogues on human rights
issues.
</P>
<P>
"It is our hope that such consultations and dialogue with
countries concerned on human rights issues will continue," he said.

<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli government responded positively Saturday to
statements made by Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss in an
interview with the BBC to the effect that the Lebanese Army would
deploy in south Lebanon and prevent attacks on Israel should it
pulls back its troops from the security zone in south Lebanon. But
several hours after the interview, Hoss' office said his words
had been taken out of context and misunderstood.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Netanyahu is considering appealing officially for the first
time to Hoss to begin immediate direct negotiations on an Israeli
withdrawal within months from south Lebanon without the
participation of Syria, according to a senior Likud source. The
source said Netanyahu had been considering such a move even before
Hoss spoke to the BBC.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- The national airline El Al had to cancel two flights to the
United States Saturday night since some pilots began a strike,
demanding a wage rise. Senior managers will hold an emergency
meeting Sunday morning to deal with the situation.

<HEADLINE> Study on Deng Xiaoping Theory Yields Important Achievement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Five research bases focusing on
the study of Deng Xiaoping Theory have reported fruitful
achievements over the past two years.
</P>
<P>
The Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist
Party of China (CPC), the Ministry of Education, the Chinese
Academy of Social Sciences, the University of National Defense,
and the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences have finished 126
research projects on Deng Xiaoping Theory in nearly two years.
</P>
<P>
They have published more than 1,000 theoretical articles and
350-odd books related to the subject.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 seminars held during the past two years have also
resulted in over 220 weighty study reports, some of which included
"The Cardinal Issues of Marxism' and "The Basic Issues of Mao
Zedong Thought" by the Party School of the CPC Central Committee,
and "Essentials of Study on Deng Xiaoping Theory" and a selective
volume on socialism with Chinese characteristics by the Ministry
of Education, and Deng Xiaoping's ideas on new-period army
building by the University of National Defense.
</P>
<P>
Some study results have been practiced in reality, such as "
ways out for state-owned enterprises", the "southeast Asian
financial crisis and its impact over China", and the "study on
China's social stability".
</P>
<P>
These studies have drawn the attention of and won high praise
from the central and local authorities as well as the relevant
departments.

cooperation in economic, trade and all other fields have already
had a very good foundation and have also scored noticeable
achievements."

quite strong in its industrial foundation and is also very
developed in economic field and especially in some technological
areas where China can learn from," he said.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Allegedly Involved in Weekend Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Israeli police said on Sunday
Palestinians were suspected of involving in the three attack
incidents on Israeli soldiers over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
And the General Security Service had been asked to help
investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
Over the weekend, the police reported three attack attempts on
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
At 10:30 p.m. local time Saturday night, an Israel Defense
Forces (IDF) soldier was stabbed in the shoulder at a bus stop
outside Jerusalem's Malha Mall.
</P>
<P>
Witnesses said the attacker was an Arab man, who fled the
scene in a waiting vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Police set up road blocks in the Mall area and roads leading
out of the city shortly after the incident in a bid to catch the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
Several hours earlier, watchman Arkady Lishansky was seriously
wounded in a separate shooting incident, while he was guarding
heavy vehicles in the construction site of a new portion of a
highway between Elkana and Ariel in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Lishansky had been taken to hospital for treatment and he is in
a serious but stable condition, police said.
</P>
<P>
The IDF and security forces searched the scene Saturday night
but found nothing.
</P>
<P>
On Friday afternoon, 49-year-old Aharon Lefkowitz was stabbed
in the neck while walking near the Damascus Gate in Jerusalem's
Old City.
</P>
<P>
Israeli police said all these attacks were nationalistically
motivated. However, no arrests were made so far.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: Chinese FM on U.S.-Japanese TMD Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here this afternoon that any attempt to include
Taiwan in the Theater Missile Defense (TMD) system between the
United States and Japan will meet with "strong opposition" from
the entire Chinese people, including compatriots in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference sponsored by the 2nd Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) this afternoon that such
attempt will inevitably amount to an encroachment on sovereignty
and territorial integrity of China and an obstruction to the great
cause of peaceful reunification of China.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that China is "very concerned about" the
development of TMD system.
</P>
<P>
He said that the move "does not go with the trend of the time"
and "is not conducive to the international disarmament efforts."
</P>
<P>
"It will also exert negative impact on regional and global
strategic balance and stability into the next century," he said
</P>
<P>
He said that the joint research and development of TMD between
the U.S. and Japan will greatly enhance the overall offensive and
defensive ability of the military alliance," which will go far
beyond the legitimate defense needs that the relevant country has
repeatedly indicated."
</P>
<P>
"It will also harm the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific
region," he said.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Minister on Macao Transition </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan expressed confidence at an NPC press conference here today
that a smooth transition and transfer of government in Macao will
be realized through the joint efforts of Chinese and Portuguese
sides.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will resume the exercise of sovereignty
over Macao in 288 days and that will be another big step forward
in the great cause of China's reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
Last year China and Portugal conducted very productive
consultations concerning a smooth transition and transfer of
government in Macao, as well as related specific issues, he said.
As the day of Macao's return to the motherland draws near, senior
officials of China and Portugal will continue to have many
important contacts and meetings, he said.
</P>
<P>
"I believe that as long as both sides can act according to the
Basic Law for Macao, and adopt a pragmatic, positive and
constructive approach, cooperation between China and Portugal will
build on the current basis and produce great results," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And I also believe that, through the joint efforts of both
sides, a smooth transition and transfer of government in Macao
will be realized," he said.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- For the past five decades, the
Chinese women have been developed an image of self-confidence,
self-respect, self-improvement, and independence worldwide by the
means of increasing contacts overseas and through active
international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Feng Cui, a member of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF), told Xinhua today that this year's
International Women's Day is particularly significant for the
Chinese women because of the 89th anniversary Of the Women's Day
and the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the ACWF had forged ties with more than 550
children's and women's organizations in over 140 countries and
regions and co-operative projects with various international
organizations like the UNDP, UNICEF, and Canadian and Australian
international development programs.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, new, substantial progress was scored in overseas
contacts, Feng said, pointing to the more than 200 representatives
from 28 countries and regions who gathered in Beijing in June to
evaluate the situation of the Chinese women three years after the
Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. The conscientious
implementation of the Beijing Declaration and related agreements
have played an important role in improving the status of the women
in China, he added.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, women's delegations from China and the
European Union (EU) had held extensive discussions on human rights,
women's efforts in alleviation of poverty, and their role in
economic development and participation in politics. After a visit
to a number of neighborhood communities in Beijing and factories
and villages in and around Tianjin, these women's delegations
praised the Chinese women for their candidness in airing views
about human rights issues as well as their efforts to improve
their status.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Expects Breakthrough in "Test-Tube </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A South African professor is
on the verge of a breakthrough which could see the human body
re-growing its own parts, Sunday Times reported.
</P>
<P>
A multinational medical company has given Professor Peter Zilla
30 million rand (4.8 million U.S. dollars) to fine-tune his
research into " tricking" the body into growing new arteries and
heart valves.
</P>
<P>
If successful, the project will provide a cost-effective and
safe alternative to the dangerous and expensive process of using
pig's valves to replace human heart parts, said the report.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to offer the body an artificial scaffold which...
allows the body to do what it did as an embryo -- grow arteries or
heart valves," Zilla was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the artery implant will be available
in five years and the more complicated valve implant in about
eight years.
</P>
<P>
Zilla's research is part of a broader international drive to
"grow" human body parts, eventually doing away with the need for
donor organs and the risk of rejection.
</P>
<P>
Zilla's work is based on research he did in Vienna, Austria, in
the 1980s, where he developed artificial arteries. His new
research is based at the hi-tech, privately funded Medtronic
Institute, the latest addition to the heart center at the
University of Cape Town (UCT).
</P>
<P>
The shortcoming of his previous breakthroughs was that the
arteries needed a hi-tech laboratory, but his new research is
aimed at developing implants which could be kept on a "shelf" and
transplanted at a small hospital.
</P>
<P>
His work is causing excitement in South African medical
circles, with one scientist at the UCT describing it as the most
important development since the world's first heart transplant by
a South African doctor, Chris Barnard, in 1967.
</P>
<P>
The research has special significance in South Africa as the
World Health Organization estimates that heart disease will
outstrip AIDS as the major cause of death in South Africa by 2020,
said Professor Lionel Opie, head of the UCT's Heart Center, where
Zilla is based.

<HEADLINE> DETAILED: Tang Jiaxuan on China's Foreign Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
At a press conference held by the ongoing 2nd Session of the
Ninth National People's Congress, Tang noted that China has made
great achievements at the diplomatic front in an international
situation of major, deep and complicated changes under the
leadership of Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has safeguarded national sovereignty and
dignity, territorial integrity, and protected the country's
security interests, he said, adding it has also taken positive
steps to promote the peaceful reunification of the motherland.
</P>
<P>
China's friendly relations with its neighboring countries are
continuing to develop, while its unity and cooperation with other
developing nations have also strengthened, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China's ties with the world's major powers,
including the U.S., Russia, Japan and European nations, are also
developing. It has started to form a future-oriented framework of
state-to-state relations with nearly all major powers, he added.
</P>
<P>
On major international issues concerning peace and security,
especially when regional hot spots are at a juncture of war or
peace, he went on to say, China is always opposed to the use or
the threat of use of force, and stands for peaceful solutions.
</P>
<P>
At such crucial junctures, China has always played a
constructive role, preventing or stopping a deterioration of
relevant problems, he said.
</P>
<P>
On the Asian financial crisis, he continued, China has built
itself an image of peace, friendship, unity and responsibility,
which has won world recognition and acclaim.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of the century, China will strive to promote its
cross-century and comprehensive diplomacy, Tang said, adding that
China will adhere to its independent foreign policy of peace and
take Deng Xiaoping's diplomatic thinking as a guideline for the
country's diplomatic work.
</P>
<P>
China will continue to strengthen its unity and cooperation
with other developing nations and join them in safeguarding their
legitimate rights, and further consolidate good-neighborly ties
with its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
The country will enrich and substantiate the content of future-
oriented state-to-state ties with major world powers, which have
been set up or are about to be set up, he said.
</P>
<P>
Tang said that China will continue to oppose hegemonism and
power politics, and strive to help set up a fair, equal and
mutually beneficial international new political and economic order.

LAGOS, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Following are major news items in

</P>
<P>
New Nigerian:
</P>
<P>
-- Nigerian Head of State General Abdulasami Abubakar said
Saturday his government is committed to the development of the
agricultural sector in order to meet the requirements of the
people and industries.
</P>
<P>
The Post Express:
</P>
<P>
-- Since Nigeria's president-elect comes from the southwest and
his deputy from the northeast, the People's Democratic Party
leaders may have agreed that to make the other geopolitical zones
have a sense of belonging, the senate president should come from
the southeast, while speaker of the house of representatives
should be produced by the northwest.
</P>
<P>
This Day:
</P>
<P>
-- In a report released Friday, U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan raised an alarm over Nigeria's plan to pull out the West
African peace-keeping force of ECOMOG in Sierra Leone.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Foreign Minister on Sino-US Relations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Minister Tang
Jiaxuan said here today that the visit to the United States by
Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji next month will provide another
opportunity for improving and further developing Sino-US relations.
</P>
<P>
"Major objectives of Premier Zhu's visit to the United States
are to enhance mutual understanding, expand common ground and
promote cooperation, so as to maintain the good momentum of the
improvement and growth of China-US relations and allow the two
countries to move toward the objective of building a constructive
and strategic partnership," said Tang at a press conference
sponsored by the ongoing Second Session of the Ninth National
People's Congress, China's legislature, this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Noting that this year marks the 20th anniversary of the
normalization of Sino-US diplomatic relations, Tang said that
China is willing to bring a sound and stable relationship between
the two countries into the next century.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, there have emerged some anti-China noises
within the United States recently, which is nothing strange.
</P>
<P>
"There are always some people who do not want to see Sino-US
relations develop and get improved, and they have always wanted to
do anything to disturb the development of such relations," said
the foreign minister. "But I believe that their attempt will get
nowhere and will be futile."
</P>
<P>
These noises were directed not only against China, but also
against the Clinton administration's China policy of comprehensive
engagement with China, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister went on to emphasize that the Taiwan question has
always been the most important and most sensitive issue in Sino-US
relations which deserves the greatest attention.
</P>
<P>
"As long as our two sides can strictly adhere to the principles
of the three China-US joint communiques and the joint China-US
statement, especially such important principles as mutual respect
for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual non-interference
in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit,
relations between China and the United States will enjoy a smooth
growth," he said.

<HEADLINE> URGENT: China to Make Greater Efforts to Join WTO: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- China is prepared to make further
efforts to gain access to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
Chinese foreign minister Tang Jiaxuan said here this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
U.S. trade representative Charlene Barshefsky paid a visit to
China several days ago and held talks with her Chinese counterpart
which produced important progress and were constructive, Tang said
this afternoon at a press conference sponsored by the ongoing
Second Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC).
</P>
<P>
"But there are still important differences between the two
countries," Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Both China and the United States are making efforts for an
early Chinese access to the organization, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that China has made considerable concessions in this
regard during the past decade, Tang described the talks and
negotiations between China and concerned parties as "marathon
talks".
</P>
<P>
"The only reason why the issue has not been settled so far is
that some countries disregard the fact that China is a developing
country and put too high demands on it, some of which are
excessively exorbitant," Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Women Increasing Exchanges with Overseas (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The UNDP has also provided small loans for female workers who
are laid off in Tianjin, the first action of its kind that has
tried in China to deal with this problem with the help of the
international organization.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese women's pragmatic approach about overseas contacts
and exchanges has won recognition from the international community,
which in turn has helped them get more assistance in developing
women affairs, Feng added.
</P>
<P>
The dialogue between the Chinese women and the women overseas
on an equal footing has not only improved the overall quality of
life for the Chinese women and their social status and has given
the rest of the world's women to reach a more objective conclusion
on their own about the current situation with the Chinese women.
</P>
<P>
An EU women's lobby official who rejected to participate in the
Fourth World Conference on Women, said, "I should have come to
China at an earlier date," after having had a look at the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
The ACWF will continue to promote exchanges with women's
organizations in the U.S. and Europe, while developing still
closer ties with neighboring countries.

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- For the past five decades, the
Chinese women have been developed an image of self-confidence,
self-respect, self-improvement, and independence worldwide by the
means of increasing contacts overseas and through active
international co-operation.
</P>
<P>
Feng Cui, a member of the Secretariat of the All-China Women's
Federation (ACWF), told Xinhua today that this year's
International Women's Day is particularly significant for the
Chinese women because of the 89th anniversary Of the Women's Day
and the 50th founding anniversary of the People's Republic of
China.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1998, the ACWF had forged ties with more than 550
children's and women's organizations in over 140 countries and
regions and co-operative projects with various international
organizations like the UNDP, UNICEF, and Canadian and Australian
international development programs.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, new, substantial progress was scored in overseas
contacts, Feng said, pointing to the more than 200 representatives
from 28 countries and regions who gathered in Beijing in June to
evaluate the situation of the Chinese women three years after the
Fourth World Conference on Women in 1995. The conscientious
implementation of the Beijing Declaration and related agreements
have played an important role in improving the status of the women
in China, he added.
</P>
<P>
In October last year, women's delegations from China and the
European Union (EU) had held extensive discussions on human rights,
women's efforts in alleviation of poverty, and their role in
economic development and participation in politics. After a visit
to a number of neighborhood communities in Beijing and factories
and villages in and around Tianjin, these women's delegations
praised the Chinese women for their candidness in airing views
about human rights issues as well as their efforts to improve
their status.

<HEADLINE> Manila to Build 10,000 Classrooms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 7, (Xinhua) -- More than 10,000 classrooms will
either be built or rehabilitated in six underdeveloped provinces
of the Philippines to widen the poor's access to quality basic
education and boost the achievement levels of public school
graduates, a report released from the presidential office said
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Under a foreign-funded program of the Department of Education,
Culture and Sports (DECS), 1,662 classrooms will be built and
9,337 existing ones repaired or renovated in Benguet, Ifugao,
Antique, Guimaras, Agusan del Sur and Surigao del Sur.
</P>
<P>
DECS Undersecretary and Spokesman Victor Andres Manhit said the
funding would come from the department's 1.64 billion peso (41
million U.S. dollars) Third Elementary Education Project (TEEP).
</P>
<P>
The five-year TEEP is being funded by the World Bank and the
Overseas Economic Cooperation Fund of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The new classrooms due for construction starting in school year
1999-2000 are on top of the 8,196 classrooms the DECS is putting
up this year under its 2.5 billion peso (625 million U.S. dollars)
School Building Program (SBP).
</P>
<P>
This means that almost 10,000 new classrooms are set for
construction all over the country -- 8,196 classrooms under the
SBP and 1,661 more under TEEP.
</P>
<P>
In a recent study, the Bureau of Elementary Education traced
the low achievement levels of public school to the shortage of
classrooms, noting that overcrowded classrooms made it difficult
for pupils to absorb learning.

<P>
-- A South African professor is on the verge of a futuristic

using pig's valves to replace human heart valves.
</P>

The Sunday Independent:
</P>
<P>
-- The killers of Chris Hani, former African National Congress
and South African Communist Party leader, have failed in their bid
for amnesty. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission's Amnesty
Committee has rejected Clive Derby-Lewis and Janus Walus' citing
of a political motive and has found that the killers did not make
a full and truthful disclosure, which are both key elements of a
successful amnesty bid.

state relations, namely Sino-Russian strategic partnership of
coordination, which is characterized by non-alliance and non-
confrontation and is not directed at any third country or third
party.
</P>
<P>
"The Sino-Russian relations have been developing very well," he
said.
</P>
<P>
The minister recalled that Chinese Premier Zhu Rongji's visit
to Russia not long ago was "very successful", during which Zhu
held important talks with Russian leaders including President
Yeltsin and Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov. President Yeltsin
said that Russia's cooperation with China is "open", Tang added.
</P>
<P>
The two countries reached a number of positive results during
Zhu's visit and signed 16 agreements, Tang added.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have agreed to further explore the potential of
long-term cooperation in new fields including energy, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Mobile Phone: One of Africa's Fastest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's mobile phone industry
has become one of the fastest growing telecommunications sectors
in sub-Saharan Africa with a market that has grown to 70,000
subscribers within a space of two years.
</P>
<P>
The coming on stream of the three major operators-- the
state-owned NetOne, privately- owned Enhanced Communications
Network (Econet Wireless) and Telecel Zimbabwe, has brought
tremendous relief to the fixed telecommunications network that was
struggling to cope with the growing demand for telephone services,
the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
The current registered demand for the fixed telephone service
is about 345,000 which was made up of 225,000 customers in main
lines and a waiting list of over 120,000, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Since the introduction of the mobile phone service over two
years ago, thousands of jobs have been created in downstream
industries such as advertising, cellphone service providers,
handset shops, among others as competition increases between the
three networks.
</P>
<P>
In an interveiw with the newspaper Saturday, Econet's Chairman
and Chief Executive Strive Masiyiwa said that his company has
invested about 840 million Zimbabwean dollars (22.1 million
U.S.dollars) and is planning to put an additional 836 million
Zimbabwean dollars by the coming June.
</P>
<P>
NetOne's cellular telephone service has experienced substantial
groth from nothing to over 30,000 customers within the past two
years.

<HEADLINE> Chinese President Confident of Hong Kong's Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today expressed his confidence in Hong Kong's future at a group
discussion with legislators from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (HKSAR) who are here attending the Second
Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), the nation'
s highest lawmaking body.
</P>
<P>
"No nation or region could have smooth sailing in development,
and it is natural to incur loss and pay a price in time of
difficulties and risks." the President said.
</P>
<P>
"Although Hong Kong still faces difficulties for the present as
a result of the Asian financial crisis, it still has sound
development foundation and will surely see a new vista after
weathering the current difficulties."
</P>
<P>
Jiang listed four basic bases in assessing the situation in
Hong Kong: the principle of "one country, two systems" put forward
by Deng Xiaoping and the policies of "Hong Kong people governing
Hong Kong" and a high degree of autonomy; the full confidence in
the Hong Kong People's ability to govern Hong Kong; the HKSAR
government capable of handling complicated situations; and the
motherland's strong backing for Hong Kong in keeping prosperity
and stability in time of difficulties.
</P>
<P>
Expressing his confidence of the HKSAR government in overcoming
difficulties and maintaining stability and prosperity, Jiang said
the situation in Hong Kong is on the whole good despite the impact
of the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
"The work of the HKSAR government has been highly fruitful
since Hong Kong's return to the motherland, the financial and
economic security of the region has been maintained, and the
region's status as an international financial center has been
consolidated," the President said.
</P>
<P>
"We have ample reasons to have full confidence in a glorious
future of Hong Kong," he added.
</P>
<P>
"Our motherland and the 1.2 billion Chinese people are the
strongest backing for Hong Kong. Whatever happens and whatever
difficulties and challenge Hong Kong faces, the motherland and the
people will provide the strongest support and remain in the same
boat with the Hong Kong compatriots." Jiang stressed.
</P>
<P>
Pointing to the central government's firm and sincere attitude
and practice in implementing the policies of "one country, two
systems" and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong", and granting
Hong Kong a high degree of autonomy, Jiang said, "situation could
change and new problems crop up in implementing such policies.
Only when we make concerted efforts to use new experience to
enrich the practice of implementing the policies, could Hong Kong
maintain its real stability and prosperity and develop further."
</P>
<P>
"The successful implementation of the principle of 'one country,
two systems' not only sets a good example for a smooth return of
Macao but also has far-reaching significance on a final solution
of the problem of Taiwan," according to the President.
</P>
<P>
Describing the reunification of the motherland and the
revitalization of the Chinese nation as an irresistible historic
trend and the common aspiration of the Chinese people including
Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan compatriots, Jiang stressed, "it is
not an unforeseeable future to realize the complete reunification
of the motherland."

<HEADLINE> Interview: Undernourished S.&AMP;T. Facilitate Nepal's </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Although short of investment,
science and technology have definitely played a role in the
national development of Nepal in certain areas, a noted Nepalese
scientist said.
</P>
<P>
Professor Dayananda Bajracharya, vice-chancellor of the Royal
Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (RONAST) has said that
though planned development in Nepal started as early as 1956, the
need of science and technology in the country's development was
first mentioned only in the sixth five-year plan (1980-1985).
</P>
<P>
But "there has been some appreciable contribution toward the
national development as a result of indigenous research in the
country," he told Xinhua in a recent interview.
</P>
<P>
He cited as examples the development of various improved
varieties of rice, successful application of tissue culture
techniques in agriculture, horticulture and forestry, and the
cultivation, collection and processing of medicinal herbs.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to the development of modified and more
efficient version of water mills, the development of improved cook
stoves, the innovative designs of bio-gas plants, the development
of indigenous technologies in the field of microhydel projects and
the designing of solar dryers and cookers.
</P>
<P>
The exploratory researches in the field of mining and geology
led to the support of local industries, he said.
</P>
<P>
"In a country like ours, it is not so easy to have a major
breakthrough," the vice-chancellor added.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the South Asian region, his country is in the
middle level in terms of science and technology development,
better than Bhutan and the Maldives but cannot compare with Sri
Lanka and India.
</P>
<P>
In the region, Nepal's investment in science and technology is
very very low, much lower compared with India, Sri Lanka and
Pakistan, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There has been a strong tendency in the country among the
politicians, intellectuals and the policy-makers to believe that
investment in the field of science and technology is a kind of
luxury that a poor country like Nepal cannot afford," he wrote in
a paper published in May, 1998.
</P>
<P>
"They think that there are more serious and immediate problems
in the country which requires the investment of our meager
resources," he wrote. "With an investment of nearly 0.13 percent
of GNP (the latest available figure), Nepal belongs to the
countries where the investment in science and technology is one of
the lowest even by regional standard."
</P>
<P>
Professor Bajracharya complained that the country invests so
much in sports but not in science and technology, because the
latter is not a priority sector of the government.
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are many other bottlenecks deterring the
development of science and technology in Nepal like improper
implementation of policies, poor coordination among the concerned
institutions, inadequate involvement of scientists in
policy-making and lack of lasting policies.
</P>
<P>
But the major problem is the lack of investment, and as a
result, potentials of the country's 8,236 scientists and
technicians are not fully tapped, he said. "The only thing is that
the government has to realize the importance of the sector and
then invest properly," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Nepal boasts a hydropower potential of 83,000 MW but only 257
MW have been exploited so far. As an agricultural country, the
Himalayan kingdom is now in food deficit.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank regarded ineffective research and
extension services as a factor that contributes to Nepal's
agriculture's deterioration.
</P>
<P>
Encouraging signs have appeared. In the Ninth Five-Year Plan
(1997-2002), the government has decided to develop science and
technology for all-round national development and achieve
self-sufficiency in the field by enhancing intellectual
creativity.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, identified research activities in the fields of
agriculture, information technology, energy, bio-technology and
bio-diversity will be conducted continually.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year perspective plan for science and technology also
lays emphasis on the development of technologies the country
needs, an official from the Ministry of Science and Technology
said.
</P>
<P>
A taskforce constituted by the ministry, which was established
in May 1996, has recommended that the level of investment in
science and technology be increased to 1 percent of GNP by the end
of the ninth plan and increased further at the rate of 1 percent
every five years.
</P>
<P>
At the turn of century, the autonomous RONAST is to organize a
four-day national conference on Monday on science and technology,
which will bring together some 700 Nepali scientists and about 30
foreign participants.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Chancellor Bajracharya said the conference offers an
opportunity to assess the current status of science and technology
in the country as well as to share ideas.
</P>
<P>
"The third thing I'm very much interested is to bring awareness
among the politicians, intellectuals and the society that science
and technology is a very very important sector that we cannot
develop the country without proper development of it," he said.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that nearly 400 research papers have been
submitted to the conference, and some theme papers have been
identified on implementation of policies and programs, utilization
of water resources, development and promotion of renewable energy,
opportunities and challenges in the development of indigenous
technologies and regional cooperation.
</P>
<P>
"We think in certain specific areas, we'll have a clear picture
of how we should go forward in the coming age," the
vice-chancellor said with confidence.

<HEADLINE> Premier Confident about Success of SOE Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Premier Zhu Rongji expressed
confidence in the success of state-owned enterprise reform here
this morning at a group discussion attended by deputies to the
National People's Congress from Jilin province, northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The deputies discussed the government work report he delivered
last Friday at the opening session of the NPC, China's top law-
making body.
</P>
<P>
"Achieving the goal of turning around money-losing big and
medium-sized state enterprises is an arduous task, but we have
confidence in the success of the turning-around program and we
have means and methods," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier emphasized that, with regard to state-owned
enterprise reform, an important attitude is to see favorable
factors and boost confidence while dealing with difficulties in
real earnest.
</P>
<P>
A big step forward was made in SOE reform last year with
substantial progress having been made in separating government
functions from business operation, restructuring key industries,
providing basic unemployment relief to laid-off workers and
helping them re-employed, and in exploring ways of exercising
effective supervision over enterprise management, Zhu said.
</P>
<P>
This year efforts will be intensified to enhance central
guidance over different sectors with emphasis on key industries
and key enterprises, he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier called for carrying out the three major measures as
outlined in his government work report in this year's state
enterprise reform. The three measures are: putting a stop to
redundant construction and accelerating industrial restructuring;
continuing to provide basic life expenses for laid-off workers and
to do a good work of providing reemployment for them; and
accelerating the separation of government functions from
enterprise operation, improving the systems of control and
supervision and improving the quality of enterprise management.
</P>
<P>
"The concrete measures adopted by the central government are
correct and effective," he said. "They must be implemented fully
and to the letter."
</P>
<P>
"As long as we work with one mind, we can surely make headway
in state enterprise reform," he said.
</P>
<P>
On rural work and agriculture, the premier said Jilin occupies
an important position in China's grain production. He urged the
province to continue its effort to increase grain production while
making sure farmers' income be increased.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural sector should grow more marketable farm
produce and cash crops, he said.

<HEADLINE> Irvine Wins Australian Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Ferrari's Eddie Irvine of Ireland
broke through for his first Formula One win in a drama-filled
season-opening Australian Grand Prix at Albert Park in Melbourne
on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Race favorites Mika Hakkinen and David Coulthard were forced
out of the race early suffering mechanical and hydraulic problems
in their McLaren Mercedes after setting the pace from the front
two grid positions.
</P>
<P>
Heinz-Harald Frentzen of Germany, who finished second, pushed
Irvine to the limit on the last lap in his Jordan while his
compatriot Ralf Schumacher crossed the line third for Williams.
</P>
<P>
There was drama on the grid before the signal to even start the
race.
</P>
<P>
Both Stewart-Fords belched smoke from the rear of their cars
with critical control wires burning.
</P>
<P>
Rubens Barrichello raced for the spare car and started from the
pit-lane and recovered to finish fifth, while team-mate Johnny
Herbert was forced out of the contest before it even started.
</P>
<P>
Michael Schumacher's Ferrari stalled on the second parade lap
and he was forced to the back of the grid where he joined
Barrichello in the spare car. When the race did start another
former world champion, Damon Hill, was the next victim of an
incident packed season opener.
</P>
<P>
He was shunted off the track on the third bend of the opening
lap and his race was also over.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen and Coulthard set the early pace with Irvine on their
tail, but it was the McLaren pair that were looking the part.
</P>
<P>
With eight laps gone they had a 15 second lead over the rest of
the field and looked to be travelling comfortably.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Villeneuve then lost the tail from his British American
Racing car on the 15th lap careering into the wall and out of the
race.
</P>
<P>
Coulthard was another withdrawal on the same lap after
suffering apparent hydraulic problems.
</P>
<P>
Hakkinen was now losing speed and pulled into the pits three
laps later.
</P>
<P>
His team worked furiously to repair the damage but when he was
back on the track it was obvious he did not have the power to
compete and he withdrew shortly afterwards.
</P>
<P>
Through it all Irvine had been gaining ground, and he took the
lead after 18 laps.
</P>
<P>
Michael Schumacher's challenge received a major setback midway
through the race when he shredded a tyre and was forced to the
pits for a costly 20 seconds for new tyres and a nose cone.
</P>
<P>
By then Irvine had the lead from Frentzen in a depleted field
with only ten cars still in the race.
</P>
<P>
Irvine went to the pits in the 34th lap as did Frentzen, but
Irvine was back on the track first and used the lead to his
advantage.
</P>
<P>
He appeared to be stretching the gap but was then locked behind
Ricardo Zonta whose car was spraying gearbox oil and he could not
pass him.
</P>
<P>
Irvine passed him with seven laps to go but Frentzen had
renewed hope from the delay. However, Irvine held him off to claim
his first F1 victory in 82 starts in the 50th year of the world
championship.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Royalist Gen. Nhiek Bun Chhay Returns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Nhiek Bun Chhay, the former top
leader of resistance troops loyal to Prince Norodom Ranariddh's
royalist FUNCINPEC party, returned here Sunday, planning to take
the position as the vice president of Senate.
</P>
<P>
It is Nhiek Bun Chhay's first time to return to Phnom Penh
since he fled on July 6, 1997.
</P>
<P>
FUNCINPEC is expected to nominate Nhiek Bun Chhay as the second
vice president of the Senate who initially sought to be reinstated
in the army in his previous position, but Prime Minister Hun Sen
refused.
</P>
<P>
Prince Ranariddh, president of the National Assembly and the
FUNCINPEC party, said earlier that top CPP leaders including
President Chea Sim and Vice-President Hun Sen would not be against
Nhiek Bun Chhay having a senate position.
</P>
<P>
Under the amended Constitution passed Thursday, the senators
would be chosen by three parties with seats in the National
Assembly with the Cambodian People's Party (CPP) having 31,
FUNCINPEC 21 and the opposition Sam Rainsy Party 7.
</P>
<P>
Nhiek Bun Chhay was the deputy chief of staff of the Armed
Forces before the factional fighting of July 1997. He led troops
loyal to FUNCINPEC in clashes against troops loyal to then-second
prime minister Hun Sen, resulting in the collapse of the coalition
government and the ousting of then-first prime minister Prince
Ranariddh.
</P>
<P>
He was granted a royal amnesty as part of the mid-November
CPP-FUNCINPEC coalition deal after being convicted in absentia by
a military court in March 1998 -- along with Prince Ranariddh --
on charge of colluding with the Khmer Rouge and plotting against
the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia's Haile Gebrselassie and
Romania's Gabriela Szabo completed distance doubles at the World
Indoor Championships in Maebashi on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie added the 1,500-meter title to the 3,000 he won on
Friday, while Szabo took the 3,000 after having won the 1,500 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The only other athlete to win two individual events at the
biennial championships was Germany's Hieke Drechsler in 1987,
taking the women's 200 and long jump.
</P>
<P>
Gebrselassie never led the fast-paced 1,500 until overtaking
Kenya's Laban Rotich with six meters remaining. He finished in 3
minutes 33.77 seconds, breaking the meet record of 3:35.31 set by
Morocco's Hicham el Guerrouj in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It's fantastic," Gebrselassie said. "It's not only important
to run OK. I knew it was a very fast time."
</P>
<P>
Szabo, the youngest indoor gold medalist when she won her first
title four years ago at 19, stayed behind the early pace of
Slovenia's Helena Javornik. Then, she exchanged the lead with
Morocco's Zahra Quaziz before taking it for good starting the
final lap.
</P>
<P>
Szabo finished in 8:36.42, with Quaziz second at 8:38.43 and
Regina Jacobs third in an American record 8:39.14.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Jamie Baulch, the silver medalist in the men's 400 at
the 1997 championships, led all the way in winning by one and a
half meters over Milt Campbell of the United States in 45.73.
Campbell was timed in 45.99.
</P>
<P>
Germany's Grit Breuer won the women's 400 by three meters in 50.
80, the best in the world this year. Nigeria's Falilat Ogunkoya
was second at 51.25 and 1997 gold medalist Jearl Miles-Clark of
the United States took third at 51.45.
</P>
<P>
Britain got another gold medal in the women's triple jump, as
Ashia Hansen, the world record-holder, soared 15.02 meters on her
first attempt and it stood up the rest of the way.
</P>
<P>
Maurice Greene, the indoor world record-holder in the 60 meters,
and Gail Devers, the two-time world indoor champion, did not have
auspicious debuts at the championships
</P>
<P>
Upset by a false start, Greene was last out of the blocks in
his heat and finished second to Georgios Theodoridis of Greece.
Both were timed in 6.56 seconds, but the little-known Theodoridis,
who ran his personal best, was declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
In the women's 60 heats, Devers, owner of the fastest time in
the world this year at 6.98, also was beaten by Greek Katerina
Thanou, the 1996 European indoor champion.
</P>
<P>
Devers was the 1993 and 1997 indoor champion and the 1992 and
1996 100-meter gold medalist.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin on Work in Guangdong Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin encourages
people in Guangdong Province, south China, to further emancipate
their mind, push ahead with economic development and make further
progress culturally and ethically.
</P>
<P>
Participating in a group discussion attended by deputies to the
National People's Congress from this southern province this
morning, Jiang, who is also general secretary of the Communist
Party of China Central Committee, said the development of
Guangdong has great importance for the reform and opening up of
the entire nation.
</P>
<P>
Jiang expressed appreciation for Guangdong for its 10.1 percent
economic growth last year in spite of growing impact from the
Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Jiang called on Guangdong to do a good job in the new year in
the following aspects: first, to accelerate the establishment of a
socialist market economy and rectify the market order, especially
the order of the financial market; second, to straighten out
social order, crack down on smuggling and other criminal
activities and sweep away porn; third, to expand domestic demand
and open wider to the outside world to ensure a sustained economic
development.
</P>
<P>
On the resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Macao by
China on December 20 this year, Jiang reiterated that, after Macao'
s return to China, the central government will adopt the
principles of "one country, two systems," "Macao people governing
Macao," and a high degree of autonomy for Macao.
</P>
<P>
The Basic Law of the Macao Special Administrative Region is a
national law, which should not only be abided by by Macao but also
by other parts of the country, he said.
</P>
<P>
Beginning next year, deputies from Macao will form their own
delegation to join NPC sessions, which will be helpful for the
residents of Macao to exercise their right to manage state affairs,
he said.

<HEADLINE> Dalai Lama Obstinate in Four-Decade Splittism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Since March 1959 when he fled abroad
after a small handful of upper-class splittists failed in their
organized armed rebellion in Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, the
Dalai Lama has been obstinate in his vain attempt to gain "Tibet
Independence."
</P>
<P>
In the past four decades, the Dalai Lama has changed some of
his tactics, but his attempts to split Tibet from the motherland
have remained unchanged and he has busied himself in various
splitting activities.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Dalai Lama claimed time and again that he
seeks talks with the Central Government. In fact, this is nothing
but a political trick in the new situation.
</P>
<P>
Facts speak louder than eloquence. Whatever the Dalai Lama
clique has done over the past four decades cannot cover up his
true feature.
</P>
<P>
In the 1960s, the Dalai Lama and his followers founded their so-
called "exiled Tibet government" outside China with the Dalai Lama
as "Head of State". They aroused and mobilized ruffians and rebels
to re-establish an armed force which subsequently engaged in a
decade of military disturbances in China's border zone.
</P>
<P>
The military harassment and disturbances were aided by some
Western forces. The rebels and splittists were sent to the West
and trained at Western military bases where they learned guerrilla
tactics and were then sent back to sneak in the Tibet Autonomous
Region or China's border areas to engage in such activities as
sabotage and assassinations.
</P>
<P>
In the 1970s, the Dalai Lama clique began broadcasts in the
Tibetan language to Tibet region to fabricate and spread rumors,
resorting to demagogy and splitting activities. These broadcasts
incited confrontations among the local ethnic groups and advocated
antagonism against the Central Government.
</P>
<P>
From 1979 to 1980, the Chinese Central Government gave approval
for Dalai Lama to send his people to visit Tibet. However the "
visiting group" took this opportunity to openly stir up and incite
"Tibet independence" in Lhasa and other places.

<P>
A "visiting group" headed by Zhaidong Danzim Namgyai started
giving demagogic speeches in front of the Johkang Temple as soon
as they got off the bus. They then organized an illegal gathering
at the Gandain Monastery to overtly push for "Tibet Independence".
</P>
<P>
In 1986, the Dalai Lama's clique frequently called high-level
meetings in Dharamsala in India to plot a series of riots and
splitting activities in Lhasa. The meetings included the sixth
meeting of the "Tibet Youth Federation" and the first working
meeting of the "the Association of Tibetan Women," a working
seminar of the "Tibet Independence Movement" and special political-
education meeting for officials above the rank of grade nine.
</P>
<P>
All these meetings are focused on one theme: "Resorting to
concrete actions for Tibet independence." In April 1987, the Dalai
Lama clique called on a host of varied meetings in Dharamsala to
plan for arousing and organizing a series of riots and splitting
activities, illegal parades and demonstrations, and the creation
of social turmoil in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
After the meetings, the "Tibet Youth Federation" continued to
send their men to Lhasa and other places in Tibet in a vain
attempt to mastermind riots and create disturbances.
</P>
<P>
On September 21, 1987, the Dalai Lama addressed the United
States Congress and, on September 24, he held a press conference
at the University of Indiana, brazenly claiming that "Tibet is not
a part of China, but an independent state."
</P>
<P>
The Dalai Lama's addresses were broadcast to Tibet through his
radio station outside China and other channels. On September 27, a
riot broke out in Lhasa. Shouting "Tibet independence," the
rioters attacked local government buildings, damaged automobiles,
looted, set fires to shops and public buildings, and injured many
on-duty police officers.
</P>
<P>
A series of ensuing riots in Lhasa resulted in deaths and
further injuries and serious public property damages, greatly
affecting the normal life of local residents and normal production.
</P>
<P>
On October 7, 1987 and March 10, 1988, the Dalai Lama delivered
speeches in Dharamsala and elsewhere in India expressing his "full
support" for the riots in Lhasa, claiming that "Tibetans inside
China have high morale and great determination, and dare to shed
blood and make sacrifices."

While the Dalai's clique continued to hold so-called "uprising
commemorations" outside China on March 10 every year, the Dalai
Lama himself would stand up on the stage to deliver speeches and
overtly advocate splitting the motherland. The Dalai Lama also
worked hand in glove with anti-China forces in the world, plotted
for a so-called "peaceful march" and for "a referendum," and
attempted to internationalize the so-called "Tibet issue."
</P>
<P>
In March 1997, the Dalai Lama went to Taiwan where he colluded
with "Taiwan Independence" forces and plotted to open an office
of his "exiled government" on Taiwan island.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the Dalai Lama made another visit to the United States.
Unlike his past trips, he took advantage of the news media and
made a fuss before he started his tour, claiming that he would
issue a "statement" on Tibet's political status. He attempted to
impress the world that he would readjust his stance and policies
for the sake of finding a "sincere" solution to the question of
Tibet.
</P>
<P>
However, as soon as Dalai stopped voicing his views, his clique
on November 6 issued directions to its relevant agencies, alleging
that the report about the Dalai Lama's willingness to recognize
Tibet and Taiwan as part of China was "wrong" and "not true."
</P>
<P>
It is evident that the Dalai Lama was playing a kind of new
deceitful, political frauds and his intention is to continue his
splittist pursuit.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four decade, the Dalai Lama has gone too far on
his track of attempting to split the motherland. And what he has
done can only prove that he is the arch representative of the
political clique persisting in splittism and in the attempt to
gain "Tibet Independence" and a tool of international anti-China
forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Dalai Lama is the major source for social
disturbances in Tibet as well as the biggest obstacle to the
establishment of the normal order of Tibetan Buddhism. His attempt
to separate Tibet from its motherland and realize the fond dream
of restoring his rule in old Tibet is bound to be a complete
failure.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Hold National Conference on Science, Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A four-day national conference
on science and technology, which aims to assess the status and
bring awareness about the role of science and technology in
national development, will open here Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 700 scientists from all over the country and about 30
participants from Japan, Italy, India, Britain and Germany will
attend the conference organized by the Royal Nepal Academy of
Science and Technology (RONAST).
</P>
<P>
RONAST Vice-Chancellor Dayananda Bajracharya said the
conference will offer an opportunity for the participants to share
ideas as well. Some 400 research papers have been submitted to the
conference, he told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
"We have identified some theme papers in terms of policy and
programs: challenges for implementation, utilization of water
resources, development and promotion of renewable energy,
indigenous technology and regional cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We think in certain specific areas, we'll have a clear picture
of how we should go forward in the coming age," he added.
</P>
<P>
The vice-chancellor noted that though planned development in
Nepal started in 1956, the need of science and technology in the
country's development was first mentioned only in the sixth
five-year plan (1980-1985).
</P>
<P>
"There has been some appreciable contribution toward the
national development as a result of indigenous research in the
country," he said. "In a country like ours, it is not so easy to
have a major breakthrough."
</P>
<P>
He noted that there are many bottlenecks deterring the
development of science and technology in the country and the major
problem is lack of investment.
</P>
<P>
He complained that science and technology is not a priority
sector of the government; the country's investment of some 0.13
percent of GNP in this sector is one of the lowest even by
regional standard.
</P>
<P>
As a result, potentials of the country's 8,236 scientists and
technicians are not fully taped, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said one objective of the national conference is to bring
awareness among the politicians, intellectuals and the society
that science and technology is a very important sector for
national development.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister and RONAST Chancellor Girija Prasad Koirala is
scheduled to inaugurate the conference while Professor Klaus von
Klitzing from Germany, the Nobel prize winner in physics in 1985,
will deliver the keynote address.
</P>
<P>
RONAST is an autonomous academic body founded in 1982.
</P>
<P>
The first and second national conferences on science and
technology were held respectively in 1988 and 1994.

<HEADLINE> CIS Remains Main Buyer of Sri Lanka Tea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS) continues as the biggest buyer of Sri Lankan tea
during the past two months despite purchasing less compared to
last year, Tea Board officials and brokers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"We have come back to over 50 percent of the pre-crisis level
in the CIS market," a Tea Board official said.
</P>
<P>
In January and February this year, Sri Lanka's tea exports to
the CIS were around 3 million kilos each month. "The CIS continues
as the prime destination for exports," said a broker.
</P>
<P>
Before August 1998, when Russia suddenly devalued the rouble
and announced a moratorium on foreign loan repayments, Sri Lanka
was exporting 4-5 million kilos of tea a month to the CIS.
</P>
<P>
In September and October 1998, tea exports to the CIS dropped
to one million kilos a month. However, tea exports picked up in
November to 2.5 million kilos and 4 million kilos in December.
</P>
<P>
According to forecasts by Tea Board officials, the island might
export about 35 million kilos of tea to the CIS this year. Last
year Sri Lanka exported 44 million kilos of tea to the CIS.
</P>
<P>
"The CIS might still end up as the top importer of Ceylon tea,"
the official said, adding that they are buying much poorer quality
teas because their buying power has been reduced after the
currency devaluation.

<HEADLINE> Venture Capital Funds Essential to High-Tech Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Establishment of a comprehensive
venture capital investment system is expected to play a pivotal
role in injecting lifeblood into the high-tech sector and
invigorating national economic growth, according to China Daily "
Business Weekly" today.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, more than 80 venture investment firms had emerged in
22 provinces, with an investment capacity totaling 3.5 billion
yuan (421 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
But these firms only financed 2.3 percent of the research
findings that made the transition into industrial productivity,
said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The success of venture investment hinges on various market
factors and is subject to market rules, and therefore mindsets
inherited from the planned economy has to be extirpated, the
newspaper cited Wang Songqi, deputy director of the financial
research center of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS)
as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, there are a wide spectrum of requirements
for the successful operation of venture funds, including widening
potential sources of venture capital to include individual
investors and foreign funds as well as creating an exit for
venture capital to retreat commitments.
</P>
<P>
The current condition of the State budget means that the
government should no longer be counted on as the sole venture
investor as the market economy takes shape and demand for venture
capital soars, said Wang.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the State and self-raised funds were the only
sources of venture investment in China.
</P>
<P>
But Wang went on to say if the government goes ahead to create
a herd of venture investment firms, they will unavoidably result
in abortive investments and drainage of State assets since a
bundle of problems including budgetary limitation have not be
resolved.
</P>
<P>
And exit channels need to be widened and given equal attention
and standardized treatment, he emphasized. Generally speaking,
venture investors retreat by selling their stocks in the second
market once they can cash in profits.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested mergers, acquisitions, liquidation and
redemption as other possible means for withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Market orientation of venture investment also involves
reshuffling available capital and redirecting it as well as
establishing intermediate agencies like project assessment firms
and intellectual property rights appraisal firms.
</P>
<P>
An average of 20 percent of high-tech achievements are utilized
in industrial production in China. One-fourth of those are
estimated to fail to benefit from economies of scale.
</P>
<P>
China began to use venture investment to accelerate the
transition of high technology into productivity in 1985, when the
State Council approved the first venture investment firm - China
Venture-Tech Investment Corp.

<HEADLINE> WTO Urged to Back Thai Candidate for WTO Top Post </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Economic ministers of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) urged the World
Trade Organization (WTO) to support Thai Deputy Prime Minister
Supachai Panitchpakdi's bid for its top post.
</P>
<P>
The ministers, meeting in Phuket, southern Thailand, said in a
statement available here Sunday that Supachai, also commerce
minister, was the most suitable person for the WTO top post.
</P>
<P>
"The ministers stressed that, among all the candidates, Deputy
Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi enjoyed the broadest support
and is uniquely able to bridge the interests of the different
regions of WTO membership," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The WTO should complete the selection process in time as "it
was in the interests of the organization and its membership that a
timely decision be made on a new director general," the statement
noted.
</P>
<P>
The selection process has been delayed twice since December due
to lack of consensus among WTO members. The term of WTO's current
Director-General Renato Ruggiero expires by the end of April.
</P>
<P>
A tentative deadline was set for March 12 for the election of a
new chief to lead the world trade body into the 21st century when
a pivotal new round of trade liberalization negotiations is likely
to start.
</P>
<P>
"At this crucial juncture when WTO members face the challenge
of the next millennium and have to conduct intensive preparations
for the next ministerial conference, there is an urgent need for
new and effective leadership to lead the WTO," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
The ministers released the statement after completing a round
of informal talks on the progress of trade liberalization and
other issues.
</P>
<P>
Supachai is among the top four candidates with Canadian high
commissioner in London Roy Maclaren, former New Zealand prime
minister Mike Moore and former Moroccan trade minister Hassan
Abouyoub.
</P>
<P>
Supachai was reportedly the front-runner for the position,
especially when the geographic spread of his support base was
taken into account.

<HEADLINE> Loans to Small, Medium-Sized Industries Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The flow of bank loans to
export-oriented small and medium-sized industries in Bangladesh
has declined and created working capital crisis.
</P>
<P>
A review report of the Export Promotion Bureau (EPB) said that
big sectors like garments and tea were getting preference in
getting loans from the banks, The Independent daily newspaper
reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
EPB sources were quoted as saying that while reviewing the
situation with all related agencies and institutions, they found
that credits to the export-oriented industries in the smaller
sectors had declined in comparison to industries in the bigger
sectors.
</P>
<P>
The EPB also found less credit flow to some of the big export
sectors such as raw jute and jute goods in recent months.
"Agro-based products, petroleum products and handicraft are the
other sectors which got less credits," said a senior official of
the EPB.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a recent meeting of the Task Force on Export under
the Commerce Ministry reviewed the country's export performance
for the first six months of the current 1998-99 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
Total export during the July-December 1998 period was 2,560.71
million U.S. dollars, about 9 percent short of the targeted 2,815
million dollars and 1.5 percent less than that of the
corresponding period of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
All the export-oriented sectors except tea suffered setbacks
compared to their targets. The July-December 1998 target of tea
export was 21 million dollars while the actual export stood at
25.36 million dollars, showing a 20-percent increase.

<HEADLINE> Spanish Farmers Protest Proposed EU Subsidy Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MADRID, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Over 50,000 farmers took to streets
in Madrid Saturday to protest against a drastic cut in EU farm
subsidies proposed by Germany to the European Commission.
</P>
<P>
Farmers and herdsmen from 17 autonomous regions throughout the
country, led by a reaper and six tractors, demanded that the
government take a firm stance against the proposed subsidy cuts
when negotiating with the European Union (EU) over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Reforms on agricultural policies constitute an important part
of the Agenda 2000 for EU internal reforms, which is under
discussion now.
</P>
<P>
Currently, more than half of the EU annual budget of 86 billion
ECU (100 billion U.S. dollars) go to farmers as subsidies and
another one third to poorer regions of the Union.
</P>
<P>
Germany, which serves as the rotating president of the EU,
wants a major cut in its EU membership bill through shifting
responsibilities for farms subsidies to individual member states.
</P>
<P>
The EU's biggest paymaster with annual net contributions of
over 12.4 billion dollars on Friday proposed to the European
Commission -- the executive body of the EU -- a sharp farm subsidy
cut in the EU budget for the 2000-2006 period.
</P>
<P>
The farm subsidy cuts proposed by Bonn have drawn heavy fire
from Mediterranean states, in particular Spain, the largest
recipient of the EU subsidies.
</P>
<P>
Spanish Agricultural Minister Loyola De Palacio promised to the
protesting farmers Saturday that the government would defend their
interests.

VILNIUS, Lithuania, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania is willing to
cement its ties with China and enhance mutual understanding,
Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus and Prime Minister Gyadiminas
Vagnorius said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Chinese delegation led by State Councilor
Wu Yi, Vagnorius said Lithuania and China have no conflicts. The
two sides have signed all fundamental documents, which have laid a
good foundation for bilateral ties and created favorable
conditions for their cooperation in specific fields.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister expressed his satisfaction with the
development of the Lithuania-China cooperative relations in
economic, trade and culture fields. Lithuania hopes to accelerate
the growth of bilateral bonds and is thankful for China's support
to its bid for independence, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Wu, the head of the delegation which arrived Friday for a one-
day visit, said China backs Lithuania's efforts to safeguard its
national independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.
China respects and understands Lithuania's choice of its road to
development and of its domestic and foreign policies.
</P>
<P>
Both counties should enhance cooperation in safeguarding their
sovereignty and territorial integrity, Wu said. She hoped that
Lithuania extends understanding and support to China's pursuit for

<HEADLINE> New Loan Service Launched to Stimulate Consumption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- A new loan service to support
purchases of expensive durable consumer goods has been launched by
the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC).
</P>
<P>
The bank is the first among the four state-owned commercial
banks to open such a loan service in Shanghai and Tianjin with the
approval of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the central bank,
according to today's Business Weekly of China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"The service is a response to the government's call to enlarge
domestic demand and stimulate consumption," said Zhang Yunzhuang,
director of the industrial and commercial credit department of
ICBC.
</P>
<P>
The loan service is designed for consumers wishing to purchase
luxury durable goods, such as computers and furniture, valued at
over 3,000 yuan each and with a lifespan of two years or more.
</P>
<P>
Applicants for the loans must be aged between 20 and 60 and
have legitimate jobs and stable income to enable repayment of
principal and interest on time.
</P>
<P>
They must also have an account in the bank and have 20 to 30
percent of the total sum in cash for the initial payment.
Qualified capital, assets or third-party assurance must be lodged
as security.
</P>
<P>
The general term for the loan is limited to six months, but
some can be extended to two years. Interest rates will be set
according to related regulations set by the PBOC on other forms of
loan.
</P>
<P>
Such loans are common practice and an indispensable way to
purchase large items in developed countries, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
But most Chinese people found this consumption style
unacceptable, according to a survey conducted by the Horizon Group.
</P>
<P>
"We hope the new service can help launch a revolution in the
consumption mentally," said Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The new loan service covers more goods than available
instalment schemes, and the upper limit of the loan is 100,000
yuan, much higher than that offered by instalment sales by some
department stores and large companies started in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The service is expected to be more popular among high-income
groups and young people who are prone to new ideas such as
consumption with borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
ICBC plans to spread the service across the country later.

<HEADLINE> Top Advisors Offer Suggestions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The government should encourage
people to invest directly in infrastructure projects instead of
depositing their money in banks, said Professor Wang Zhitai, a
member of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory
body.
</P>
<P>
Wang is one of many members of the CPPCC national committee who
are offering views and suggestions to the government on a wide
range of subjects when they discuss Premier Zhu Rongji's
government work report delivered at an annual session of China's
top legislature.
</P>
<P>
Chen Hui, a professor with Hebei University, said channels for
raising funds for infrastructure projects in rural areas should be
diversified.
</P>
<P>
Cheng Lianchang, a former vice president of the State
Administrative College, that state-owned enterprises should
establish internal incentive, innovation and comprehensive quality
control systems as soon as possible. He noted that this year is
crucial for achieving the goal of turning around money-losing
state-owned enterprises before the end of next year.
</P>
<P>
Professor Wang Shiying from Hunan Finance and Economy College
opined that China must be prudent in opening up its financial
sector to the outside world and that the degree of openness should
be "appropriate." He stressed that national financial security is
a precondition for a steady progress in the opening up of the
financial sector.
</P>
<P>
Lei Zuhua, a former governor of China Import and Export Bank,
called for providing adequate loans to big state-owned enterprises
that suffer from a shortage of funds but turn out competitive
products.
</P>
<P>
"It is necessary to stipulate, however, that such loans should
be used strictly for their intended purposes, or in a 'closed-
circuit' way," he said.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela Refuses FBI Intervention in Probe of Slayings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan government Saturday
rejected the intervention of the U.S. Federal Investigation Bureau
(FBI) in the probe of the slaying of three Americans in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Luis Miquilena said that his government would
not accept any foreign authority to meddle in its internal affairs
and Venezuela would use its own legal procedures to deal with the
crime.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a communique released by the foreign ministry
expressed deep condolence to the relatives of the victims,
promising that the Venezuelan police is making all efforts to
probe the case.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of U.S. citizens Terence Freitas, Ingrid
Washinawatok and Laheenae Gay were found on March 5, handtied,
blindfolded and riddled with bullets, floating on the Arauca River
along the Venezuelan-Colombian border, according to official
reports.
</P>
<P>
The three victims, members of a non-government organization of
defense of the Colombian U'wa indigenous ethnic group, who inhabit
a reserve on the border between the two countries, had been
kidnapped for more than one week by the Revolutionary Armed Forces
of Colombia (FARC), a rebel group which has neither denied nor
claimed the assassinations.
</P>
<P>
The communique said the Venezuelan government would prevent its
territory from being used by either subversive groups, military
and paramilitary groups, terrorists, or organized criminals to
commit crimes of any kind.
</P>
<P>
It added that the government was determined to act firmly in
each concrete case of crime within the country.

WASHINGTON, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Australian Lleyton Hewitt
became the third qualifier to reach a final this year when he beat
fellow Mark Woodforde 6-2, 6-2 in the semifinals of the Franklin
Templeton Tennis Classic in Scottsdale, United States, on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 18-year-old Hewitt, who has eliminated the world number

<P>
Hewitt, ranked 91st in the world, will play Jan-Michael Gambill
as he won an easy semifinal after fellow American Andre Agassi
retired 4-5 due to a leg injury.
</P>
<P>
"It was actually a tough match against Mark, and he's a smart
player. I was trying to move it around a lot and I didn't want him
to get into any kind of rhythm," said the youngest player in the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
"He's a total counterpuncher. He's a very crafty player," said
Woodforde, a five-time Wimbledon doubles champion after the match.

<HEADLINE> "Love Drug" Targeted in Crackdown in New Zealand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand government is
considering to make Ecstasy a class A narcotic as part of its
drive to toughen up on illicit drug use, a Wellington-based
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The plan of the government is a response to the recent reports
that five Auckland schoolgirls were taken to hospital last month
after taking near-pure Ecstasy and the country had its first known
Ecstasy death last October when Ngaire O'Neill, 27, died after
taking the "love drug" in a nightclub.
</P>
<P>
It is also a response to a statement made by Prime Minister
Jenny Shipley who said recently that use of Ecstasy had increased
dramatically in the past two years. Before 1997 there had been
occasional seizures by authorities, but since March 1997 almost
12,000 tablets have been intercepted, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Dominion recently also quoted Shipley as saying that the
new classification would put the "love drug" in the same category
as heroin, cocaine and the hallucinogenic drug Isd, and result in
much tougher penalties for its use.
</P>
<P>
The maximum penalty for importing or supplying a class A drug
is life imprisonment, compared with 14 years for a class B drug.
For using a class A drug, the penalty is a maximum of 1,000 N.Z.
dollars (540 U.S. dollars) fine or six months' imprisonment,
compared with 500 N.Z. dollars (270 U.S. dollars) fine or three
months' jail for a class B drug.
</P>
<P>
"It is important that young people get a clear message that
this (Ecstasy) is a dangerous drug, not something they can use
for fun," Shipley said.

</P>

Grenada had developed close ties with Cuba during the center-

10, 1983. One week later, the United States invaded this
southeastern tip island of the Caribbean region.
</P>
<P>
At the time of the invasion, 700 Cuban workers were in Grenada

<HEADLINE> Panama Supports U.S. Sanctions Against EU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Panama supports and follows
very closely the sanctions imposed by the United States on the
European Union (EU) for the banana trade regime, press reports
said Saturday, citing a government source.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, the United States imposed a 100 percent
tariff on products from the EU bloc, charging it with
incompliance with the resolution issued in 1997 by the World Trade
Organization (WTO) in reference to its banana trade regime.
</P>
<P>
Francisco J. Alvarez de Soto, advisor in Panama's Foreign Trade
Ministry, deplored that the EU maintained its own interpretation
on the WTO resolution to justify its claim that its measures were
compatible with the WTO, benefiting its former Caribbean colonies
in damage of Latin American products and U.S. marketing companies.
</P>
<P>
"Panama considers that the support for the firm U.S. attitude
of setting a good precedent is the best solution, because it
concerns not only bananas. With this resolution, a future
procedure for solving trade controversies is, in a certain way,
being established," De Soto said.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Panama has so far lost more
than 300 million U.S. dollars in its banana exports to Europe
since July 1993, when the EU started to implement its banana trade
regime.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN SALVADOR, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Salvadoran outgoing President
Armando Calderon Sol received Saturday in the presidential house a
group of international observers, who were invited to supervise
the presidential election.
</P>
<P>
Calderon Sol said the presence of almost 1,000 foreign
observers who will supervise the election on Sunday "is a guaranty,
" and expressed his confidence that "the people will respond in a
massive way to this duty of expressing its will."
</P>
<P>
Some three million Salvadorans will be convoked on Sunday to
elect the president and the vice-president of the republic from
among a total of seven candidates and their respective formula
mates.
</P>
<P>
Francisco Flores of the ruling Nationalist Republican Alliance
(ARENA) and Facundo Guardado of the National Liberation Farabundo
Marti Front (FMLN), the main opposition party, are the candidates
with the biggest possibilities of being elected president,
according to the polls.
</P>
<P>
ARENA is seeking another five-year term in the presidency,
which it has held since Alfredo Cristiani took office in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Franciso Flores, the 39 year old U.S. and British-educated
former congressional president, vowed to crack down on criminals
and develop the economy.
</P>
<P>
The Salvadoran economy grew about 3.5 percent last year after 4.
5 percent growth in 1997. The unemployment is estimated at 40
percent and the country's per capita gross domestic product is 1,
977 dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the leftist FMLN hopes to end the 10-year
rule of the ruling right-wing ARENA.
</P>
<P>
Facundo Guardado, the former guerrilla commander, is the Front'
s presidential candidate.

<HEADLINE> Panama Demands Extradition of Noriega </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PANAMA CITY, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Panamanian Attorney General
Antonio Sossa on Saturday requested the extradition of Panama's
former ruler Manuel Antonio Noriega, now imprisoned in Miami, the
United States.
</P>
<P>
Sossa said that Noriega should pay for the crimes he committed
in Panama while in power.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. judicial authorities are expected to extradite Noriega
to Panama after he serves his imprisonment in the United States on
charges of drug smuggling and racketeering, press reports said.
</P>
<P>
Noriega was detained and taken to the United States as a war
prisoner in 1989 when U.S. troops invaded Panama and toppled his
military government.
</P>
<P>
At a hearing held last year, a former Central Intelligence
Agency (CIA) chief, a former U.S. ambassador, and a former colonel
in the U.S. Army Southern Command requested the reduction of
Noriega's sentence, due to finish in 2022, saying that Noriega had
maintained "long years of service" to the U.S. government.
</P>
<P>
On March 4, the U.S. federal judge in Miami announced that the
40 years' imprisonment imposed on Noriega would be reduced to 30
years.
</P>
<P>
Noriega's U.S. lawyers said their client could obtain a
conditional release on bail in the year 2000 and be remitted by
2007.
</P>
<P>
Noriega, 65, will die in prison if the 40-year sentence is not
reduced, said his lawyers.

that have been launched in the last two years. Pollution-fighting
programs for the Huaihe River and Taihu Lake cost ten billion and
billions of yuan resepctively, he said. Last year the central
government decided to ban logging in areas covered by natural
forests and issued an additional 100 billion yuan worth of treaury
bonds with the money raised being spent on new infrastructure
projects, including many environmental protection ones, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Any delay in taking action to improve the environment will do
harm to the health of the people and hinder economic growth," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking about development strategy for central and western
parts of the country, he said that it is imperative for these
regions to carefully plan the structure and location of industries
so that natural resources, especially water sources, are better
protected.
</P>
<P>
"If water sources were polluted, these areas will soon lose the
momentum of development," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called for shutting down polluting factories along the upper
Yellow river.
</P>
<P>
Qu expressed confidence in China winning the war against
pollution, noting that the Chinese government is attaching
unprecedented importance to the issue. He expressed appreciation
for Beijing for its ongoing efforts to combat air pollution.
</P>
<P>
"Environment protection poses both challenges and opportunities
for China," he said.
</P>
<P>
"As the government and people get increasingly aware of the
importance of environment protection and as the state increases
investment in this field, environmental protection in China will
enter an unprecedentedly good period," he said.

<P>
CARACAS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan police detained
Saturday 10 Venezuelan and Colombian nationals suspected of drug
trafficking.
</P>
<P>
Police spokeswoman Commissar Odalia Caldera said more than 70
kilograms of drug were seized in an airport, some 25 kilometers
from Caracas.
</P>
<P>
The drugs were hidden in a box of merchandise, ready to be
transported by a remittances firm.
</P>
<P>
Caldera said Venezuelan police, supported by the Colombian
police, took more than one month to investigate the case.
</P>
<P>
The authorities estimated the detained people are members of a
Colombian drug cartel which used the Venezuelan remittances firm
to introduce cocaine to European countries.

<HEADLINE> Offshore Oil Company Hails Sino-Vietnamese Joint Statement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The recent Sino-Vietnamese Joint
Statement will accelerate oil and gas exploration in the Beibu
Gulf, according to Sunday's China Daily Business Weekly.
</P>
<P>
The weekly noted that a Chinese offshore oil company plans to
cooperate with its Vietnamese counterpart to expand exploration in
the gulf, which is abundant in oil and gas resources.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply inspired by the important results reached by
the two sides during the recent successful visit of Le Kha Phieu,
general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party
of Vietnam," said Chen Bingqian, spokesman for the China National
Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC).
</P>
<P>
The document, saying to complete the demarcation by the two
nations in the gulf before the end of the year 2000, will promote
exchanges and cooperation between the CNOOC and Vietnam Oil and
Gas Corp. (Petrovietnam) on exploration in this area, Chen said.
</P>
<P>
CNOOC has limited exploration in the gulf in order not to
impose negative effect on the Sino-Vietnamese relations due to the
suspended demarcation, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The demarcation will pave the way for the CNOOC to fulfill its
long-term plan for large-scale exploration in China's territorial
waters of the Beibu Gulf and other areas of the South China Sea,
according to the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that we will be able to fuel South China and
even East China with clean natural gas in the next century," the
paper quoted Chen as saying.

<HEADLINE> Anti-US Slogans Daubed at US Base in Italy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Death threats and anti-U.S. slogans
were found daubed on cars outside the NATO military base in Italy'
s Aviano, from which the U.S. plane involved in the Mt. Cermis
tragedy took off, police in Aviano said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Other angry slogans in regard to Thursday's acquittal of the U.
S. pilot were found on a block of flats in the northeast Italian
town, which is home to the largest U.S. Air Force base in Italy.
</P>
<P>
One car was daubed "Death To Americans", while another was
covered with foul language. The wall of the apartment block was
sprayed with death threats.
</P>
<P>
All the slogans were in English, sprayed in black paint and
tagged with the circled "A", typical of anarchist groups.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. military court acquitted marine pilot Richard Ashby of
responsibility in the death of 20 tourists killed on February 3,
1998, when his low-flying plane snipped their cable-car wires.
</P>
<P>
The court ruling, based on the fact that Ashby and crew were
given incorrect maps and having instrumental problems, sparked
indignation in the home countries of the victims.
</P>
<P>
Three of the victims were Italian, seven German, five Belgian,
two from Poland, two from Austria and one from Holland.
</P>
<P>
In Washington on Saturday, visiting Italian Prime Minister
Massimo D'Alema urged U.S. President Bill Clinton to see justice
was done.
</P>
<P>
Clinton apologized for the incident and said the U.S. would
offer adequate compensation. Italian political parties have
unanimously called for a review of rules governing NATO bases in
Italy and the jurisdiction of trials in such cases.
</P>
<P>
Italian and U.S. defense ministries have agreed to work out new
rules to prevent a recurrence of the Mt. Cermis tragedy.
</P>
<P>
Aviano is one of several NATO bases in Italy used for
operations in the Balkans. D'Alema and other Italian officials
have repeatedly said the incident poses no threat to operations at
the bases.

<HEADLINE> Tibetan Economy to Enjoy Higher Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tibetan economy is expected to
grow about ten percent this year compared with the envisaged
seven percent of the national economy, according to Chairman of
the Tibetan Autonomous Region Legqug who is here to attend the
ongoing 2nd Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan economy grew ten percent last year, higher than the
national average of 7.8 percent for the fifth year in a row, said
the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"At present, Tibet is pushing ahead with reforms and its
economy is growing fast, it enjoys a lasting social stability and
has made headway in various social undertakings, and the life of
the Tibetan people continues to improve." the chairman said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that income of the urban and rural
residents rose 5.4 percent and six percent last year, respectively.
</P>
<P>
"All these achievements are inseparable with the correct
leadership of the central government, concerted efforts of the
Tibetan people and assistance from the people of other parts of
the country," the chairman pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Of the 62 projects undertaken by various provinces and cities
to assist the development of Tibet, 60 projects had been completed
by the end of last year, he said, adding that the central
government departments and governments of other 15 provinces and
cities also plan to start 269 projects to help Tibet with a total
investment of more than 1.2 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Tibet will continue to develop agriculture and animal husbandry
as priorities, increase capital spending on infrastructure
facilities, vigorously develop pillar industries, encourage non-
public sector to develop and continue to improve the quality of
people's life, Legqug said.
</P>
<P>
The Tibetan people will unswervingly maintain social stability,
the reunification of the motherland and the solidarity of ethnic
groups and push the region's economic and social development onto
a new stage, he said.

<HEADLINE> Gustafsson Plays Santoro in Copenhagen Tennis Finals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COPENHAGEN, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Magnus Gustafsson of Sweden
defeated second seeded Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-3, 6-1 to reach
the final on Saturday at the Copenhagen Open for the second
straight year.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish will vie for the top honour on Sunday against
Fabrice Santoro, who defeated Sebastien Grosjean 1-6, 6-2, 6-0 in
the other all-French semifinal.
</P>
<P>
The third-seeded Gustafsson, who spoiled a semifinal meeting
between the Black brothers when he beat Wayne Black in the
quarterfinals, will be playing his 24th career ATP Tour final on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"If I'm playing like I did today, I feel I have a pretty good
chance in the final," he said, "I always have the crowd on my side
in Copenhagen. It's very nice and it helps. It's like playing in
Sweden."
</P>
<P>
Gustafsson, who took his 12th career title here last year when
he was the oldest (31 years, 6 months) winner on the tour, helped
Sweden win its third Davis Cup title in three years last December.
</P>
<P>
He underwent arthroscopic surgery later that month which forced
him to miss the Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
Santoro, seeded fourth in the indoor tournament, will be
playing his second final this season. He won the Marseille Open in
his native France in early February.
</P>
<P>
Santoro lost three ATP Tour finals early in his career betwen
1990 and '94 before finally winning his first singles title two
years ago in Lyon, France.

<HEADLINE> Increasing Demand Spurs Car Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The turnover will stand at somewhere between 306 billion yuan
(36.86 billion US dollars) and 311 billion yuan (37.46 billion US
dollars), the paper said, quoting a latest report from the China
Automobile Industry Consulting and Development Co..
</P>
<P>
The total output of vehicles is forecast to rise by 5 to 10
percent from last year's figure of 1.62 million. As many as 400,
000 vehicles in use will be scrapped in 1999, potentially creating
large areas of demand for automakers.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, the growth rate of vehicle output was only 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Passenger car sales in 1999 will increase by 15 percent from
500,000 sold in 1998, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Individual purchase will be the key driving force behind the
growth.
</P>
<P>
Although per capita gross domestic product (GDP) in China is
less than 700 U.S. dollars, far from the basic level needed to
afford a car, the report pointed out that many urban residents
enjoy the financial resources required to buy a car.
</P>
<P>
In urban areas, per capita GDP is 1,570 dollars. In some
developed coastal regions, this figure rises as high as 3,000
dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey by the Guangzhou Statistics Bureau
in south China's Guangdong Province, 4 percent of the city's
households intend to buy cars in 1999.
</P>
<P>
More households in small and medium-sized cities are also
planning car purchases this year as traffic is not so heavy as in
the municipalities.
</P>
<P>
The prices of most car models have fallen to the average
international level following a two-year price war, which is also
considered a factor likely to spur car demand.
</P>
<P>
Automobile production and sales already grew significantly in
the first month of 1999 compared with the same period last year,
reflecting improving market sentiments.
</P>
<P>
As many as 131,500 vehicles were produced in January, with 126,
400 vehicles sold, up nearly 30 percent and 43 percent
respectively from January 1998, according to the State Machine-
Building Industry Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Sales of passenger cars rose by 44.6 percent in the month.

<HEADLINE> Hungary Takes Measures to Fight Waterlogging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BUDAPEST, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian Prime Minister Orban
Victor on Saturday declared a state of alert in eastern areas of
the country to fight the increasingly serious waterlogging there.
</P>
<P>
Victor made the announcement shortly after officials from the
ministries of transport, telecommunications, water conservancy,
interior, defense as well as the prime minister's office discussed
the situation at a joint meeting.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he appointed the ministers of transport,
telecommunications and water conservancy special commissioners to
oversee the fight.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that the Cabinet will discuss next
Tuesday whether more measures should be taken to cope with the
most serious waterlogging in Hungary since 1966.
</P>
<P>
The report issued by Hungary's water conservancy authorities
showed that around 320,000 hectares of fields had been submerged
in water. However, press reports put the figure at 400,000
hectares.
</P>
<P>
In some areas, water also flooded the feed lots and rubbish
tips, making local drinking water liable to pollution.
</P>
<P>
Experts warned that Hungary's agricultural yields would suffer
loss this year if the situation cannot be brought under control
quickly.

<P>
SHANGHAI, March 7 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong International Airport
will open to traffic on the scheduled date of October 1, according
to Wu Xiangming, a construction project manager.
</P>
<P>
 More than 85 percent of the construction work of the first
phase, which has a total floor space of 600,000 square meters, has
already been completed, and the first phase will open to traffic
on October 1, new China's 50th founding anniversary, he said.
</P>
<P>
A 4,000-meter-long and 60-meter-wide runway has already been
built and the installation of lighting facilities has also been
completed, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
The first phase involves a total cost of 11 billion yuan (1.3
billion US dollars) and has lasted more than two years. The
opening of the new airport will make Shanghai the first Chinese
city with two large international airports.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's air traffic has grown by an average annual rate of
23 percent in recent years, with passenger volume reaching 13.7
million in 1998.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Venezuelan, Colombian Presidents to Meet Over Border Disputes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 6 (Xinhua) -- Venezuelan Presidents Hugo Chavez
and his Colombian counterpart Andres Pastrana will hold a meeting
next week, Venezuelan Foreign Minister Jose Vicente Rangel
announced on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Rangel said the Pastrana-Chavez meeting will be held Thursday
afternoon in the Venezuelan border city of San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
The minister did not mention the themes to be discussed during
the meeting, but said that the agenda will be open.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry sources the two leaders are expected to
discuss the border disputes and the Venezuelan position in the
conflict between Colombia's guerrilla and the Colombian government.
</P>
<P>
Rangel had said several days ago that Pastrana and Chavez would
discuss political issues, meaning that the conversations will be
centered on the peace process between the Colombian government and
the guerrilla groups, the Venezuelan contribution to the peace and
bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Venezuela facilitated the conversations between the National
Liberation Army (ELN) and the high commissioner for peace, Victor
Ricardo, approximately one year ago, a process that ended without
any agreements.
</P>
<P>
The ELN demanded from Pastrana, among other things, the
demilitarization of a zone bordering Venezuela to start its
national convention. However, Bogota has not complied with this
request, so the conversations are bogged down.
</P>
<P>
President Chavez declared Venezuela's neutrality toward the
Colombian internecine conflict and offered asylum to guerrillas
and injured soldiers coming from the neighboring country.

TIANJIN, March 7 (Xinhua) -- Overseas investment in the Tianjin
Economic Development Zone in this north China port city remained
stable despite the Asian financial crisis, zone official Li Yong
said.
</P>
<P>
Contracted overseas investment in the zone totaled 190 million
U.S. dollars in the first two months of this year, roughly the
same as in the same period last year, according to Li.
</P>
<P>
However, the financial crisis has reduced the number of Asian
investors in the zone, said Xu Wenjin, another zone official. But
he added that the number of investors from Europe and the United
States have on the rise,
</P>
<P>
Moreover, some Asian companies, including several from the
Republic of Korea, have increased their investment in the zone, Xu
noted.
</P>
<P>
The Asian financial crisis has lowered the cost of manpower and
land, making this a good time to enter the China market, Li said.
