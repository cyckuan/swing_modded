Clinton Heads to Africa, Middle East
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is on his way to Africa to give
Nigeria's fragile democracy a boost and encourage efforts to maintain peace
among warring factions in Burundi. While in Nigeria, Clinton plans to tell
President Olusegun Obasanjo that the United States supports Nigeria as it
secures its democracy. He flew out shortly after the White House made known that
he is adding a Monday stop in Cairo to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, a Middle East ally, to discuss the Middle East peace process.

U.N. Chief Releases Letter on Bomb
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan released a
controversial letter Friday which assured Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi that a
trial of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner would not
''be used to undermine the Libyan regime.'' The defense team for the two
Libyans, who have been on trial in the Netherlands since May 3, asked British
authorities to release the Feb. 17, 1999 letter from Annan to Gadhafi detailing
the terms of a trial under Scottish law. Libya accepted the terms and handed
over the two suspects seven weeks later.

   GRANTS PASS, Ore. (AP) -- Carl Barks, the Disney illustrator credited with
giving Donald Duck his distinctive feisty and comical personality, died Friday
at the age of 99. He had been receiving chemotherapy for leukemia, but ''was
funny up to the end,'' said his caregiver, Serene Hunicke. Barks drew Donald
Duck for Walt Disney Studios from 1935 until 1942, and continued afterward as
the creative genius behind the Donald Duck universe.

   PROSSER, Wash. (AP) -- in an attempt to control a fast-moving wildfire that
had spread across 100,000 acres in two days, firefighters set backfires across
southern Washington's parched sagebrush country Friday. Sparked by lightning on
Wednesday, the fire was threatening 50 homes near the Yakama Nation reservation
and already had consumed 24 other structures. More than 5.84 million acres have
burned across the United States this year in what has been called the worst
western fire season in a half-century.

   Florida-based Badia Spices Inc. is recalling about 22,000 bottles of paprika
because the spice may be contaminated with salmonella, which can cause serious
infections in certain people. The Miami company recalled ''Badia Paprika'' that
has the following identification on the bottle's label: The expiration date
11-2002, and the UPC number 33844-00011. The paprika is sold in 2-ounce plastic
bottles. Consumers should not eat the recalled product but return it to the

Experts Probing Gulf Air Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- As Gulf Air Flight 072 approached Bahrain
International Airport for a landing Wednesday, pilot Ihsan Shakeeb requested a
''go around'' from air traffic controllers. Shakeeb, an experienced pilot,
circled Bahrain International Airport once, then aborted his landing attempt
without explanation, according to Gulf Air officials. Moments later, the Airbus
320 -- and its 143 passengers and crew -- disappeared from the radar and
nose-dived. U.S. and Bahraini teams are expected are meeting with six French
government experts and a representative of Airbus Industries to determine the
cause of the crash.

FDA Warns of Bowel Treatment Effects
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A popular new treatment for irritable bowel syndrome could
cause severe intestinal side effects -- some requiring surgery -- that have
already affected at least 19 women. The Food and Drug Administration announced
Thursday it had ordered Glaxo Wellcome Inc. to attach to every bottle of
Lotronex a plain-English pamphlet explaining the risk, and that women should
stop taking it at the earliest sign of a problem. Women have reported either a
potentially life-threatening intestinal inflammation called ischemic colitis or
severe constipation, and the FDA has preliminary reports of another 14 cases
since Lotronex hit the market six months ago.

<HEADLINE> China Releases U.S. Poet  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN LEICESTER
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING (AP) -- Chinese police released the U.S.-based editor of
a dissident literary magazine after 16 days in custody and put him
on an airplane Saturday, sending him back to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Bei Ling, speaking by mobile phone on the way to Beijing's
airport, said Chinese and U.S. diplomats arranged his release to
smooth over ties before President Jiang Zemin travels to New York
next month for a U.N. summit and talks with President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Police also freed Bei's brother, Huang Feng, late Friday, a
little more than a week after he was detained as part of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Bei's Aug. 11 arrest drew angry publicity in the United States
that threatened to undo months of diplomacy aimed at repairing
shaky U.S.-China ties. Well-known authors wrote essays demanding
his release that appeared in major U.S. newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Bei, a poet, has lived in the United States since 1988. Based in
Boston, he has edited a literary journal, Tendency, and he and
others have routinely smuggled copies of the journal into China for
distribution among Chinese intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
   While he has traveled back to China occasionally, Bei agreed to
leave the country as a condition for his release and it was
uncertain when he would be allowed to return. Police planned to put
him on an Air China flight bound for San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Bei said police accused him of illegal publishing and told him
if he refused U.S. exile he would face three to 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have to leave. I have no choice,'' Bei said at the departure
hall of Beijing's Capital Airport. ''If I didn't leave I would have
gone to jail.''
</P>
<P>
   Bei said he was not mistreated while he was detained, he had
eaten well and the prison was fairly clean. As part of his release,
police fined him $24,000, only $1,200 of which he was able to pay,
and they made him pay for his plane ticket to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   One of two plainclothes police officers who escorted Bei to the
airport said the poet was under a six-month parole while the
investigation continued.
</P>
<P>
   Bei's arrest came amid a broadening crackdown by the communist
government on the publishing industry. Chinese leaders fear that
criticisms of the government and calls for political change,
however mild, could further incite workers and farmers already
protesting corruption, layoffs, taxes and stagnating incomes.

<HEADLINE> Legionella Bacteria Found in Md.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOWSON, Md. (AP) -- Officials at St. Joseph Medical Center banned
showers and distributed bottled water to patients Friday after an
inspection of the hospital's hot water system revealed the presence
of the bacteria that can cause Legionnaire's disease.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital, just north of Baltimore, began treating the hot
water system Thursday after tests taken last week revealed elevated
levels of legionella bacteria, said hospital spokeswoman Linda
Harder. Results from the tests were received earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''From what I've heard, they're following, if not exceeding,
standard guidelines and practices,'' said David Blythe, medical
epidemiologist for the Maryland Department of Health and Mental
Hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   No patients currently at the hospital have contracted
Legionnaire's disease, a potentially fatal respiratory illness.
However, a patient who was recently released from St. Joseph has
been confirmed as having legionella and is recovering at home.
</P>
<P>
   It is not clear if that patient contracted the bacteria at St.
Joseph, Harder said.
</P>
<P>
   Legionella, a water-borne bacterium, can be inhaled when water
is released into the air, through air conditioners, steam or other
means.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, a state health task force released
recommendations to hospitals that included routinely testing water
systems, giving doctors quick access to diagnostic tests and
setting up Legionnaire's response teams to deal with outbreaks.
</P>
<P>
   The task force was appointed after several cases of the illness
appeared in the Baltimore area last summer and four people died in
Harford County.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Warned Against Using Credit  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- With a horde of American businessmen and
journalists here for President Clinton's weekend visit, U.S.
diplomats have issued an odd security warning: Don't use your
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria, a country with a rich tradition of scams and
swindles, it's widely assumed that credit card numbers will be
passed on to thieves and fraudulent charges may begin appearing
long after the visitor has returned home. One journalist in the
region said it's happened to him twice following reporting trips to
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   From hotel clerks attempting to pad their meager salaries to
military dictators accused of plundering billions of dollars in oil
wealth, corruption has impoverished this potentially prosperous
land for decades.
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo declared war on corruption after his
election last year and his government is trying to track the vast
sums of state oil money that vanished into foreign bank accounts
during the military dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But restoring Nigeria's badly tarnished reputation and
retrieving the cash is a monumental task.
</P>
<P>
   International investors shy away from the country, having heard
too many tales of massive fraud. Nigerian involvement in
international drug smuggling, money laundering and embezzlement
schemes has made it difficult for Nigerians to obtain visas
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And critics say Obasanjo's anti-corruption drive has not been
broad based, focusing mainly on people linked to his former rival,
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   The president ''has just picked on a few of Abacha's cronies and
asked them to give back a portion of the money they stole,'' said
Gani Fawehinmi, an outspoken lawyer who has written extensively
about government malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government still tolerates our culture of corruption,'' he
said. ''The average Nigerian has come to believe it's OK to rob a
bank as long as you agree to return some of the money if you're
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   International surveys routinely name Nigeria as the world's most
corrupt country. Last year, when Nigeria was edged out for the top
spot by Cameroon in one ranking, Nigerians boastfully joked that
they had bribed Cameroon to accept the dubious honor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Obasanjo's government can point to several high-profile
victories:
</P>
<P>
   -- Senate President Chuba Okadigbo was voted out of office this
month after he admitted receiving a $220,000 Christmas bonus and
purchasing $370,000 worth of furniture for his official residence,
far more than allocated. He was the third senior politician ousted
for wrongdoing in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Switzerland handed over $66 million in July from bank accounts
linked to Abacha. The Swiss, acting on requests from Nigeria, have
frozen $670 million in accounts held by the late general and his
associates. Luxembourg has frozen similar accounts worth $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian government claims that the senior Abacha, his
family and close friends plundered the Central Bank for as much as
$3 billion during his five years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why corruption is so pervasive, Nigerians offer
several theories.
</P>
<P>
   The huge oil industry has created a fantastically wealthy elite
and national get-rich-quick mentality. Politicians and businessmen
have stolen shamelessly and rarely been caught or punished.
Millions of Nigerians in acute poverty feel left out of the gold
rush, and have seen that wrongdoing seldom has repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians also have an entrepreneurial flair that sometimes runs
amok. As a result, petty corruption is part of everyday life. The
Nigerians even have their own word for a small bribe -- dash.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil-rich Niger Delta, siphoning crude from oil pipelines
is a national pastime despite the enormous risks. Oil vandals have
ignited several raging fires in recent months, claiming hundreds of
lives and prompting the government to establish a security force
authorized to shoot on sight. Undeterred, kidnappers seize oil
workers for ransom -- or in some cases for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Idriss Abubakar, opposition senator and anti-corruption
campaigner, said Nigeria's deep-rooted corruption problem has no
easy solution, and he questions whether the government is up to the
task.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any foreign investor bringing money to Nigeria
until he sees serious change,'' Abubakar said. ''So far, that
change is not visible.''

<HEADLINE> Estonia Ferry Dive Prompts Outrage  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL TARM
<TEXT>
<P>
   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) -- Ulo Veide can't focus on work this week.
His mind keeps wandering to a diving expedition seeking new clues
about why the ferry Estonia sank in 1994, killing 852 people --
including Veide's twin daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The Swedish and Estonian governments have criticized the
expedition as a desecration of an official resting place for the
750 bodies that were not recovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''They speak about disturbing the peace of the dead. But what
about the peace of the living?'' Veide asked. ''We deserve answers
to why our children died. It's about time there was an expedition
like this.''
</P>
<P>
   The ferry, en route from Tallinn to Stockholm, Sweden, went down
on Sept. 28, 1994, during a storm in the Baltic Sea off the coast
of Finland. It was one of Europe's worst maritime disasters.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation about why it sank has included theories of
explosions and sabotage, despite a 1997 official report that blamed
poorly made bow door locks and criticized the crew for a slow
response.
</P>
<P>
   Veide, whose 24-year-old daughters Hannely and Hanka-Hannika
were at their first day of work on the ferry, doubts the official
explanation and welcomes the series of privately funded dives led
by New Mexico businessman Gregg Bemis.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a very traumatic week for anyone who lost loved ones
on Estonia,'' said Veide, a 62-year-old factory director in Parnu,
60 miles south of Tallinn. ''But I'm still glad it's happening. ...
I've been waiting for this for five years.''
</P>
<P>
   With Swedish and Finnish coast guard ships looking on, Bemis'
team of divers this week began inspecting the ferry, which lies
more than 250 feet deep. The divers have been going down in shifts
of six or seven at a time, the Baltic News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
   Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Denmark, Lithuania, Russia and Britain
have signed an agreement that declares the site an off-limits
sanctuary, but the dives can't be legally prevented because the
wreck lies in international waters.
</P>
<P>
   Bemis, 71, has said he will talk about what he found only after
the mission is over next week. His few public comments since the
dives started have hinted at discoveries but provided no details.
</P>
<P>
   He told Swedish officials he was searching for possible holes on
the starboard side of the ship and looking for charts on the
captain's bridge that might clarify the crew's actions.
</P>
<P>
   Bemis has said it was important to answer remaining questions
about the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is no reason to believe that the technical investigation
we plan to go through with would disturb this resting place in any
way,'' he was quoted as saying by the Swedish news agency TT.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by a Swedish-Estonian-Finnish commission, based
partly on more than 100 hours of underwater footage, blamed the
ferry's German builder, Meyer Werft, for poorly made bow door locks
and said the crew responded too slowly.
</P>
<P>
   A separate report, done on behalf of the German shipyard, blamed
poor maintenance of the locks and said a bomb could have exploded
on board, a possibility the commission dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Survivors described scenes of horror on the 15,000-ton Estonia
as it sank, with seawater swirling up stairwells and slot machines
and tables crushing people as they slid across restaurants and
dance floors.
</P>
<P>
   Estonian Ander Paeorg, whose wife died in the disaster, said the
dive only brought bitter memories back to the fore.
</P>
<P>
   ''I see my wife in the eyes of my son every day, so of course I
can't forget,'' Paeorg said. ''But I have found a new rhythm in my
life, and so these kinds of events can be very hurtful.''
</P>
<P>
   Critics have questioned the motives for the dives. A German
television producer had a team on board to film them and reportedly
planned to sell the footage to television stations.
</P>
<P>
   Others said they didn't see what the dives could accomplish. The
Estonia is probably badly rusted, and may be covered in algae,
seaweed and silt, making it difficult to see or film the ship, said
Kari Lehtola, a Finn who was one of the official investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Some survivors say they don't know whom to believe.
</P>
<P>
   Risto Ojassaar, one of just 138 people who managed to escape,
said he hopes Bemis finds something that sheds light on the most
terrifying day of his life.
</P>
<P>
   ''But I very much doubt he will,'' he said. ''I don't think we
will ever know what really happened.''

<HEADLINE> Mandela: Africa Should Envy Kosovo  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNA LOOF
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- The world's failure to take
sufficient action in African conflicts leaves the continent with
reason to envy Kosovo, former President Nelson Mandela says.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking Friday at the opening of the final seminar of the
International Independent Commission on Kosovo, Mandela said the
world has been reluctant to halt African conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Rwandan genocide is the most well-known example of
such a failure to intervene, the international community similarly
has neglected the conflict in Sierra Leone, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not suggesting that ... African conflicts can be
subjected to the same template of conflict resolution or that the
actions of Kosovo can simply be transplanted to the conflicts on
this continent,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We in Africa and Asia must, however, envy the readiness and
willingness on the part of the international community to intervene
and commit resources to the reconstruction of Kosovar society.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year's 78-day bombing campaign on Yugoslavia came after a
Serb crackdown on Kosovo's ethnic Albanian majority. Kosovo, a
southern Yugoslav province, has been run by the United Nations
since the end of the bombing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela said the world's interest in the Burundi peace process --
over which he is presiding -- is encouraging, as is Western leaders'
expressed willingness to rebuild Burundi after a peace agreement is
signed.
</P>
<P>
   ''We would wish to see Burundi as a showcase of peace, bringing
its dividends through the actions of the international community,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Kosovo commission, established in August 1999, aims to
ascertain what happened in Kosovo before, during and after the war,
and analyze the conflict's effects. Its final report is expected
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Besides presenting research about conflict and intervention, the
report could encourage important discussion among leaders, scholars
and others, Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   The commission could help promote the idea that globalization is
not only about markets, but that it also must ''mean that the ills
and woes of one are the shared concern of all,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   ''As we learn to understand that destructive part of our human
condition that has caused so much pain and suffering throughout our
human history, we may advance in the knowledge that we share so
much -- bad and good,'' he said. ''Together, and only together, can
we make the world a better place for our children to grow up in.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Program Suffering Setbacks  </HEADLINE>
By CONNIE MABIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- A children's health insurance program
created by the state and promoted by Gov. George W. Bush as a
successful public-private partnership is getting out of the
insurance business.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Healthy Kids Corp., cited as a positive example by the
Bush campaign as recently as Sunday, will stop insuring children on
Sept. 15, said Durquia Guillen, director of operations.
</P>
<P>
   Campaigning for ''prosperity with a purpose,'' Bush, the
Republican presidential nominee, proposes more reliance on
charities and private institutions to pick up where government
leaves off. As president, Bush has said, he would dedicate $8
billion in tax incentives to encourage volunteerism and charity.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore's campaign accused Bush of not truly
addressing children's health issues in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ''Children's health insurance is a perfect example where Bush
has been negligent but is telling the nation that he's wonderful,''
said Gore spokesman Doug Hattaway. ''It certainly raises questions
as to whether Governor Bush even knows or cares what's going on
with children's health insurance in his own state.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with a lack of state and private money, increasing
insurance rates and competition from a new government program,
Texas Healthy Kids will start referring needy children to private
health insurance companies or other public programs, Guillen said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're in transition,'' Guillen said. ''I don't know what's
going to happen as we keep evaluating, but what we do know that
there are a lot of affordable choices out there for families that
were not always out there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those choices is CHIP, the Children's Health Insurance
Program, which Bush signed into law for Texas in 1999. It's a
larger and cheaper program funded by federal and state money that
came into existence after Texas Healthy Kids Corp. was formed in
1997.
</P>
<P>
   About 8,000 children will be affected by Texas Healthy Kids
getting out of the insurance business. Those youngsters will be
transferred to CHIP or referred to non-subsidized private insurance
carriers, Guillen said, stressing that the organization will keep
working with needy families to help find health coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not closing our doors. We're not going to be shutting
people off so that they'll wake up one day and not have health
insurance for their children,'' Guillen said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign on Sunday referred to the Healthy Kids Corp. in
countering criticism about Texas' high rate of uninsured children.
Texas has the nation's second-highest rate of uninsured children,
accounting for some 1.4 million of the nearly 11 million nationwide
who lack health insurance. Only Arizona has a worse rate.
</P>
<P>
   ''Uninsured children from families with incomes too high to
qualify for the CHIP program can purchase low cost coverage through
the Texas Healthy Kids Corporation. The corporation was created in
1997 through legislation signed by Governor Bush,'' a Bush campaign
news release said.
</P>
<P>
   A Bush campaign spokesman referred questions to Bush's state
spokesman Mike Jones.
</P>
<P>
   ''Is it fair to tout it? Yes, Texas Healthy Kids obviously was
created before the state got an opportunity to implement a CHIP
program and during that time frame it served a useful purpose,''
Jones said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said there are several successful public-private
partnerships working in Texas, including drug rehabilitation and
adoption programs.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997, Healthy Kids Corp. has been awarded $15.4 million in
public money and has used $10 million in private funds to subsidize
premiums for uninsured children.
</P>
<P>
   While the government-funded CHIP program covers children whose
parents earn up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level, Texas
Healthy Kids did not have income limits.
</P>
<P>
   Under CHIP, parents pay a $15 annual fee and monthly premiums as
low as $18. Healthy Kids premiums ranged from $58 to more than $100
a month.
</P>

   Texas Insurance Commissioner Jose Montemayor said he is
attempting to get private insurers to offer coverage to the
children who could end up uninsured with the phasing out of Healthy
Kids insurance.
</P>
<P>
   So far, about three companies have agreed to work with the
insurance department, Montemayor said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's really going to be a matter of the department directly
stepping into the shoes of where Healthy Kids was,'' Montemayor
said.

Clinton Leaves For Africa, Middle East
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is on his way to Africa to give
Nigeria's fragile democracy a boost and encourage efforts to maintain peace
among warring factions in Burundi. While in Nigeria, Clinton plans to tell
President Olusegun Obasanjo that the United States supports Nigeria as it
secures its democracy. He flew out shortly after the White House made known that
he is adding a Monday stop in Cairo to meet with Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak, a Middle East ally, to discuss the Middle East peace process.

Experts Probing Gulf Air Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- As Gulf Air Flight 072 approached Bahrain
International Airport for a landing Wednesday, pilot Ihsan Shakeeb requested a
''go around'' from air traffic controllers. Shakeeb, an experienced pilot,
circled Bahrain International Airport once, then aborted his landing attempt
without explanation, according to Gulf Air officials. Moments later, the Airbus
320 -- and its 143 passengers and crew -- disappeared from the radar and
nose-dived. U.S. and Bahraini teams are expected are meeting with six French
government experts and a representative of Airbus Industries to determine the
cause of the crash.

   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan released a
controversial letter Friday which assured Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi that a
trial of two Libyan suspects in the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am jetliner would not
''be used to undermine the Libyan regime.'' The defense team for the two
Libyans, who have been on trial in the Netherlands since May 3, asked British
authorities to release the Feb. 17, 1999 letter from Annan to Gadhafi detailing
the terms of a trial under Scottish law. Libya accepted the terms and handed
over the two suspects seven weeks later.

   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian authorities on Saturday played down an
Olympic terrorist threat after reports emerged that New Zealand police in March
had foiled a plot targeting a nuclear reactor in Sydney. The New Zealand Herald
newspaper reported Saturday that police raids in Auckland, New Zealand, on
suspected people-smuggling operations allegedly run by organized crime gangs
uncovered evidence of a plot against a nuclear reactor in Sydney during the
Olympic games. But Australian officials said there was no serious risk to the
small research reactor, and they had no plans to shut it down.

Legionnaire's disease. The hospital, just north of Baltimore, began treating the
hot water system Thursday after tests taken last week revealed elevated levels

<HEADLINE> Navy Probes Tailhook Allegation  </HEADLINE>
By ROBERT BURNS
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is investigating allegations of
''inappropriate conduct'' by service members at a convention last
week of the Tailhook Association, the naval aviators organization
whose 1991 convention featured scandalous episodes of drunken
debauchery, property damage and sexual assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy severed its ties to the Tailhook Association after the
1991 incident and just this year decided to resume sponsoring
active-duty Navy and Marine Corps aviators' attendance at the
annual gathering, which is a combination of aviation seminars,
industry exhibits, parties, banquets and outdoor activities.
</P>
<P>
   Though much less sensational than the 1991 Tailhook scandal,
which shook the Navy at its highest levels, the latest allegation
has triggered a probe by the Navy's inspector general, officials
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Details were sketchy and the Navy would not release the name of
the person who made the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief written statement, the Navy said it is looking into
an allegation of inappropriate conduct by a group of service
members during an encounter in the Nugget Hotel in Sparks, Nev.,
with a civilian couple who were staying at the Nugget but were not
attending the Aug. 17-20 Tailhook convention.
</P>
<P>
   The Navy's chief spokesman, Rear Adm. Steve Pietropaoli, said
the Navy would not release the name of the individual who lodged
the complaint on a telephone hot line that had been set up after
the 1991 incident.
</P>
<P>
   Pietropaoli said the man reported that he and his wife were in a
crowded hallway in the hotel and that when the man asked the people
-- apparently service members attending the convention -- to make
room for the couple to pass, ''inappropriate comments'' were made
to him and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   The man also reported that someone in the group made
inappropriate physical contact with his wife, although Pietropaoli
was not more specific.
</P>
<P>
   Navy spokesman Cmdr. Greg Smith said the man who lodged the
complaint said a senior Navy officer apologized to him in person,
but the man considered it to be ''not sincere.'' The senior Navy
officer, who was not identified by name, was at the hotel but not
present during the confrontation, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the circumstances of the apology, made the day after
the alleged incident, will be part of the inspector general's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   At the Nugget Hotel, spokesman Mike Greenan said a ''noise and
profanity complaint'' was made last Friday night by a civilian
couple staying at the hotel. ''Security investigated it, got
everybody cleared out of the hallway,'' he said, adding that he was
not certain this was the same incident as reported by the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks Police Sgt. Sherman Box said the department received no
reports from or calls to the Nugget in connection with Tailhook.
</P>
<P>
   The Tailhook Association is named for the hook on an aircraft
that snags an arresting cable on the landing deck of an aircraft
carrier. As of last year, it had about 10,000 members, down from a
1991 peak of about 16,000.
</P>
<P>
   Lonnie McClung, a retired Navy captain and president of the
Tailhook Association, said in a telephone interview Friday that his
organization was surprised to hear about the complaint.
</P>
<P>
   ''As far as we knew the guys were fairly well behaved,'' he
said. ''This taints it a little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   McClung said he had no information to confirm the allegation,
which he said was made on Tuesday. He said there were about 1,200
military members among the 2,000 who attended the convention and
that hotel officials told him there were only two noise complaints
during the four-day convention, both on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ''The hotel told us our behavior was exemplary,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McClung said he did not believe the incident, if verified, would
affect his group's relationship with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this was Navy people involved, it's a Navy issue,'' McClung
said. ''The Navy should deal with it the way they see fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Olympia J. Snowe, R-Maine, took a different view. She said
Friday that if the allegation is proven true the Navy should
withdraw formal recognition of the Tailhook Association, which she
said would have been shown to exhibit a ''chronic disregard for
human dignity.''

<HEADLINE> White House E-Mail Probe Upheld  </HEADLINE>
By GREG TOPPO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A group that has dogged the Clinton
administration for months over thousands of missing e-mails will be
allowed to question the president's former top White House lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch, a Washington-based legal organization seeking to
unearth the e-mails, wants to question former White House counsel
Charles Ruff as well as John Podesta, President Clinton's chief of
staff, and attorney Virginia Apuzzo, the former assistant to the
president for management and administration.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth said Friday he will hear
testimony in the case from Ruff on Monday. The judge did not say
whether Apuzzo would testify and said he would not decide whether
to ask for Podesta's testimony until he hears from Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth said he hopes Ruff can say why administration officials
failed to tell the judge about a test of the White House e-mail
system conducted in 1998, four months after a problem was
discovered.
</P>
<P>
   Lamberth also denied on Friday a government request to end the
seven-month e-mail inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A computer glitch in 1998 prevented thousands of messages from
being archived as they entered the White House computer system. As
a result, they were not reviewed by White House lawyers to
determine whether they should have been turned over to
investigators in cases including the Monica Lewinsky scandal,
Whitewater and campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   The computer problems became public only last February, in a $90
million class-action suit filed by the conservative Judicial Watch,
which has filed several lawsuits against Clinton since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The e-mail investigation is part of a larger lawsuit over FBI
background files gathered in the White House on hundreds of
appointees from the Reagan and Bush administrations.
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch has accused White House officials of acting to
delay production of the e-mails until after November's election. It
has also said the administration has kept Lamberth uninformed about
progress in retrieving the lost e-mails.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Millet, a Justice Department attorney representing the
White House in the case, asked Lamberth to dismiss the e-mail
probe, saying any messages sought in other investigations already
have been handed over. He said there no evidence has been presented
that the government tried to deceive or lie to the judge.
</P>
<P>
   Millet, repeating testimony given previously in the case, said a
1998 test of the e-mail system wasn't reported to Lamberth because
of a ''disconnect'' between technicians and White House lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998 and 1999, Millet said, the looming Y2K millennium
computer problem ''threatened to bring down everything'' and was a
bigger concern to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   White House lawyer Mark Lindsay testified Wednesday that e-mails
lost in 1998 were the victims of a constantly crashing computer
system that was ''antiquated and unstable.'' He said the system was
upgraded in 1999 to head off expected Y2K problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsay said he told Ruff and Podesta, then the deputy chief of
staff, about the e-mail glitch in June 1998 but never spoke to
Clinton about the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., chairman of the House Government Reform
Committee, criticized the Justice Department's efforts to end the
e-mail probe, saying government lawyers are ''looking for loopholes
to protect the president and vice president.''
</P>
<P>
   Judicial Watch general counsel Larry Klayman also asked to take
a deposition from first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton in the case but
has received no reply from the White House. Klayman said President
Clinton and the first lady, as well as Al Gore and his wife,
Tipper, wrote e-mail using pseudonyms.
</P>
<P>
   The White House said the Clintons have never had such accounts.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Gore said he has an e-mail account under a
different name for security purposes. It was not immediately clear
whether Mrs. Gore has such an account.

<HEADLINE> Bush Hopes To Emulate Fox Victory  </HEADLINE>
By TOM RAUM
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is likening his
campaign to that of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox, suggesting
a similarity of tactics and goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mr. Fox did a good job of broadening the reach of his party,''
Bush told reporters after a meeting with the Mexican leader. ''He
challenged the status quo and presented a positive agenda.
</P>
<P>
   He made a compelling case that the status quo was not going to
be acceptable any more, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that, if elected, he'll immediately seek a meeting
with Fox in November to demonstrate the importance he places on the
U.S.-Mexican relationship -- and dealings in general with Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, ''I've got to win first,'' Bush added.
</P>
<P>
   Fox will be inaugurated in December.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential nominee was spending three days at
home and off the campaign trail before a three-day pre-Labor Day
trip to New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Ohio and Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier on Friday, Bush spelled out his Latin American policy in
a speech in Miami, saying that as president ''I will look South,
not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental commitment of my
presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   He also pledged to breathe new life into stalled free-trade
negotiations with Latin America while keeping all current sanctions
on Fidel Castro's Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Bush then met with Fox, who has been touring the United States,
on the campus of the University of Texas at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush congratulated Fox on ''a historic victory'' in winning the
presidency in July from the party that has run Mexico for more than
70 years. His election sends ''a strong signal of reform and
modernization in Mexico,'' the Texas governor said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he, too, was waging a campaign ''against the
status quo.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I must do the same thing'' as Fox, he said, adding he was
offering Americans ''positive ideas'' and an opportunity to
''change the course.''
</P>
<P>
   He was less supportive of Fox's proposal that the United States
open its border with Mexico to allow unfettered movement between
the two countries of workers and goods.
</P>
<P>
   ''We discussed our borders. I made it very clear ... that we
will enforce the borders as long I'm the governor and if I'm the
president,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that enforcement would be ''in a humane way.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he agreed with the leader of ''our friendly neighbor to
the south'' that Mexican wages should become more competitive with
U.S. wages.
</P>
<P>
   As to open borders, ''I don't know whether it will work or not,
but I appreciate his optimistic vision,'' Bush said. ''When the
wage differential narrows, then perhaps it's a strategy we can
explore jointly.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush has said he would request an increase in border agents
should he be elected -- primarily as a drug interdiction move.
</P>
<P>
   Fox's open-border proposal has also drawn skepticism from
President Clinton and Bush rival Al Gore, who met the Mexican
leader on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Fox told reporters after his meeting with Bush
that he hoped, ''We can build up a common future together.''

<HEADLINE> Report: Police Foil Olympic Plot  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN PYE
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- Australian authorities on Saturday
played down an Olympic terrorist threat after reports emerged that
New Zealand police had foiled a plot targeting a nuclear reactor in
Sydney five months ago.
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand Herald newspaper reported Saturday that police
raids in Auckland, New Zealand, on suspected people-smuggling
operations allegedly run by organized crime gangs uncovered
evidence of a plot against a nuclear reactor in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   But Australian officials said there was no serious risk to the
small research reactor, and they had no plans to shut it down
during the Olympic games.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand police alerted the Australian government after the
raid and several Australian security agencies had been monitoring
the investigation, New Zealand police Detective Superintendent Bill
Bishop told The Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Three ''Afghani or Afghani-related'' men were arrested for
passport fraud and people-smuggling offenses in March, and a fourth
man was arrested last week after further investigations. All were
expected to appear in court next week, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nobody has been arrested for terrorist activities or for being
part of a terrorist group or anything like that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New South Wales police, who have overall control of games
security, confirmed they were following New Zealand's
investigations. The threat was being treated seriously, as were all
matters relating Olympic security, a police spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop said the men, who were living in Auckland on New Zealand
residency permits, had maps of detailed access and exit routes to
the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights and notes on police security
tactics.
</P>
<P>
   ''The map and other material ... suggested to us they were more
than motorists,'' Bishop told the AP. ''Other details gave us cause
for concern.''
</P>
<P>
   The map was a suburban street map, not a map of the reactor, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''While they may pose a threat, any connection with the Olympic
Games is limited to the Sydney map. The threat they may pose is now
a matter for the Australian authorities to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   The New Zealand Herald said the group was reportedly linked with
Afghanistan-based terrorist Osama bin Laden, but there was no
independent confirmation of the claim.
</P>
<P>
   Milton Cockburn, a spokesman for the Sydney 2000 organizing
committee, said security during the Sept. 15-Oct. 1 Olympics was
the responsibility of the New South Wales police and declined to
comment further.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate reaction from U.S. officials.
</P>
<P>
   A nuclear reactor in Atlanta was closed down during the 1996
Olympics over concerns of possible terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   But the office of Australia's Science Minister Nick Minchin said
the reactor would not be closed.
</P>
<P>
   ''Relevant Australian authorities have made an assessment and
have advised that the risk is low,'' a Minchin spokeswoman said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for Australia's Attorney-General, Daryl Williams,
said official inquiries had revealed that ''there was no credible
threat to Lucas Heights'' at this stage.
</P>
<P>
   The 1950s-vintage nuclear reactor is not a power plant. It is
used for scientific and medical research and operated by the
Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organization. It is also
much smaller than an electricity-generating nuclear reactor. It
produces about 10 megawatts of thermal energy compared with 3,000
megawatts by a typical electricity-generating reactor.

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. (AP) -- Rookie Matt Wise pitched three-hit ball
for 8 1-3 innings and Tim Salmon homered and drove in four runs as
the Anaheim Angels beat the Cleveland Indians 4-1 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   Darin Erstad went 4-for-5 in his return to the Angels lineup.
Anaheim beat the Indians for only the second time in their last 16
meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Wise (3-1) won for the third straight time. He blanked the
Indians on two singles for eight innings before Kenny Lofton hit
the first pitch of the ninth for his 12th home run.
</P>
<P>
   Wise, who struck out five and walked two, was pulled after a
one-out walk to Roberto Alomar.
</P>
<P>
   Alomar singled with two outs in the first, then Wise retired 18
of the next 19 batters.
</P>
<P>
   Shigetoshi Hasegawa got two outs for his seventh save.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Burba (11-6) allowed three runs and eight hits in 6 1-3
innings. It was the eighth consecutive start in which he gave up
fewer than four earned runs.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad started for the first time since Aug. 19, when he left a
game in New York because of muscle spasms in the left side of his
rib cage. His four singles raised his major league-leading hit
total to 193.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad, in the DH spot, led off the first with a single,
breaking Garret Anderson's club record of 189 hits by a left-handed
batter. Salmon doubled home Erstad.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon made it 4-0 in the seventh, greeting Justin Speier with
his 29th homer after Burba gave up Erstad's fourth single and a
walk to Mo Vaughn.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels put runners at second and third in the fifth inning
with singles by Kevin Stocker and Erstad, followed by Orlando
Palmeiro's sacrifice bunt. Vaughn looked at a third strike for his
AL-leading 135th strikeout and Salmon walked, loading the bases.
</P>
<P>
   But Cleveland's Omar Vizquel, trying to become the first AL
shortstop to win eight consecutive Gold Cloves, grabbed Anderson's
tricky one-hopper and threw him out to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Wise was 9-6 with a 3.69 ERA in 19 starts this season for
Triple-A Edmonton before he was called up on Aug. 2. ... Erstad is
nine hits shy of the Angels' single-season record of 202, set in
1970 by Alex Johnson -- the only player in the team's 40-year
history to win a batting title. ... Salmon, the Angels' career home
run leader with 224, needs one more to make Anaheim the first team
in AL history to have four players with 30 homers in the same
season. It's been done five times in the NL, twice each by the
Dodgers and Rockies, and once by the Braves. ... RHP Jaret Wright
rejoined his Cleveland teammates before the game, his pitching arm
in a sling after undergoing arthroscopic surgery in Los Angeles on
Thursday to repair a torn labrum and minor fraying of the rotator
cuff in his shoulder. ... Angels closer Troy Percival, on the
disabled list since Aug. 5 because of tendinitis in his right
elbow, expects to be activated sometime during the weekend. He
worked on a cut fastball during his rehab outings to complement his
other pitches.

innings, including an RBI single by Dan Wilson in the second.
</P>
<P>
   The left-hander didn't give up a hit after the second, striking
out five, walking four and committing a balk. He was replaced by
Bobby Howry after walking Wilson to lead off the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Foulke came on with the bases loaded and one out in the
ninth. He struck out Mike Cameron and pinch-hitter Stan Javier for
his 23nd save in 28 chances.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sele (13-9) dropped his third straight decision during the
Mariners' slide in August, which began after Seattle returned from
winning three of four in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Sele gave up four runs and nine hits in 7 1-3 innings, including
three runs in a 28-pitch first inning. After Ray Durham grounded
out, Jose Valentin doubled off left fielder Rickey Henderson's
glove and Sele walked Frank Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Magglio Ordonez lined out for the second out before Carlos Lee
singled to score Valentin from third. Sele walked Paul Konerko to
load the bases before Perry hit a two-run single to center.
</P>
<P>
   In the second, John Olerud singled, Chris Widger walked and
Wilson hit an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The White Sox got a run in the eighth when Perry singled off
Jose Paniagua to score Lee from second.
</P>
<P>
   Sele walked two and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The AL Central-leading White Sox are 6-4 against the
Mariners this year, including 3-1 at Safeco Field. ... Sirotka was
a 19-3 winner over Jamie Moyer and the Mariners Aug. 9 in Chicago.
... Valentin went 2-for-3 and extended his hitting streak to 13
games, a career high. ... Henderson singled in the first for his
2,900th career hit. He's No. 32 on the career hits list behind Al
Simmons (2,927). ... The White Sox's three-run first gave them 104
runs in the opening inning, the most runs they have scored in an
inning this season. ... During Seattle's 1-11 slump, Sele is 0-3
with a 9.60 ERA, while Moyer is 0-3 with an 8.44 ERA. ... Durham
was 2-for-4, his 24th multi-hit game of the season. ... Chicago has
won the opening game in 20 of its last 25 series.

<HEADLINE> Mets 13, Diamondbacks 3  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- The New York Mets keep causing big problems for
the Big Unit.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Johnson was anything but his dominant self against the
Mets, failing to strike out a batter for the first time in 11 years
and lasting only 2 1-3 innings as New York routed the Arizona
Diamondbacks 13-3 Friday night.
</P>
<P>
   ''Nothing worked,'' said Johnson, who is 0-3 with a 7.29 ERA in
his last four starts, including a playoff game last year, against
the Mets. ''I just didn't pitch very well today. I wish I could
pitch tomorrow so I could redeem myself. But it doesn't work that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets lead Arizona by 5&AMP;frac12; games in the wild card race. The
Diamondbacks, who trail first-place San Francisco by 3&AMP;frac12; in the NL
West, have lost four in a row following a seven-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ''We've got to win baseball games regardless of whether it's our
division or the wild card,'' Arizona manager Buck Showalter said.
''None of it matters unless you win. I think that's our focus right
now. ''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson allowed six runs -- three earned -- on six hits. He also
made a throwing error in his shortest outing since April 15, 1998,
when he also worked 2 1-3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   For only the third time in his career, the 6-foot-10 left-hander
-- the NL leader in ERA and strikeouts -- did not fan anyone in a
start.
</P>
<P>
   The only other times Johnson (16-5) started and didn't strike
out a batter came in consecutive outings for Montreal in 1989 on
April 10 at Philadelphia and again five days later at Pittsburgh.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have no way to figure that out,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said of his team's success against Johnson. ''We come to
play and he probably didn't have his best stuff tonight. A couple
of our hits fell and we took advantage of some breaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Reed worked seven innings, allowing five hits and Steve
Finley's 31st homer, a three-run shot in the sixth. Only two of the
runs against Reed (8-4) were earned because of an error by
shortstop Mike Bordick.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt pretty good,'' said Reed, who snapped a personal
two-game losing streak. ''I was able to hit my spots and keep them
off-balance. For the most part, they hit it at someone except for
Steve Finley.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mets took a 3-0 lead in the second, helped out by the first
of two key Arizona errors.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Payton squirted a grounder inside the first-base bag for a
single to drive in Todd Zeile. Bordick then grounded to third
baseman Matt Williams, who was playing in. Williams dropped the
ball, picked it up and fired home but Benny Agbayani slid around
the tag of Damian Miller to score.
</P>
<P>
   Joe McEwing's safety squeeze bunt brought in Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Edgardo Alfonzo, who was 3-for-4 with a walk and two runs
scored, singled to open the third. Mike Piazza followed with a
one-hopper back to the mound. Johnson gloved it cleanly, but
skipped a throw past shortstop Tony Womack, sending Alfonzo to
third. Zeile singled in Alfonzo.
</P>
<P>
   Payton sliced a shot to right that Danny Bautista broke in on,
but let sail over his head as he jumped. The ball rolled to the
fence for a double, scoring Piazza and Zeile to make it 6-0.
Agbayani was thrown out at the plate, but Johnson's night had come
to a close.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think they are very confident and they are selective,''
Showalter said. ''I think a lot of teams are confident, but aren't
able to carry it over. It's not like he's never pitched well
against them, but lately he's struggled.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Morgan relieved and worked 3 1-3 innings, allowing four
sixth-inning runs. The big blow was Agbayani's three-run double
that made it 10-3. Agbayani, who was 3-for-3 with two walks, has
reached base safely in nine straight trips.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson lost to New York at home on Aug. 4, when he lasted only
3 2-3 innings. In the 6-1 loss, Johnson yielded five runs -- two
earned -- on eight hits. He struck out five and walked two.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson gave up five runs on eight hits in 6 2-3 innings on May
21 at Shea Stadium in a no-decision. New York won that game 7-6.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets also tagged Johnson for a loss in Game 1 of last year's
division series. Johnson gave up seven runs on eight hits in 8 1-3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   ''I take full responsibility when I go out there and pitch,''
Johnson said. ''I pitch to keep our team in the game and I didn't
do that tonight.''
</P>
<P>
Notes: New York LHP Mike Hampton threw for 12 minutes in the
bullpen before the game and he was deemed fit to start on Sunday.
Hampton missed his last start because of a stress fracture in a
rib. ... Alfonzo returned after missing one game with a stiff neck.
... The Diamondbacks have lost six straight at Shea Stadium,
including the final two games of last year's division series and a
three-game sweep in May. Arizona is 1-6 against New York this
season. ... Payton's three RBIs were a career high. ... Agbayani
walked in his first two plate appearances against Johnson, seeing
only eight pitches.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Families Identify Victims  </HEADLINE>
By SUSAN SEVAREID
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- In small groups, relatives of the victims
of this week's Gulf Air crash began perhaps the most painful part
of their ordeal: identifying their loved ones.
</P>
<P>
   They started by looking at photos while seated at coffee tables
in a hotel meeting room under the eyes of medical teams and
counselors. Those who had been through it were easy to spot by
their blank stares.
</P>
<P>
   Nadr al-Khawaja, a Bahraini, helped his uncle identify a son,
daughter-in-law and their 9-month-old baby. The body of the
daughter-in-law, 19-year-old Marwa Badl, an Egyptian, was to be
flown to Cairo on Saturday for burial.
</P>
<P>
   ''We thank God that she was not destroyed like others,''
al-Khawaja said Friday. ''She was innocent, still young. She liked
to jog.''
</P>
<P>
   The uncle's son, Sultan Farja, and the baby, Mohammed, were
buried in Bahrain on Thursday, the day after the Airbus 320 crashed
into the Persian Gulf off the coast of Bahrain, killing all 143
passengers and crew members aboard.
</P>
<P>
   Photo identification was only the start, but Gulf Air
spokeswoman Alyson Evans said it was necessary to spare relatives
from having to walk past rows of corpses and body parts in a
mortuary. After the photo ID, relatives were taken to view the
remains for a final identification and claim them for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Officials did not allow journalists near the makeshift morgue in
a port near the crash site. It was not clear how many bodies had
been claimed, though many of the Bahraini victims were buried in
funerals Thursday and Friday. Several of the Egyptian victims were
expected to be flown to Cairo on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Evans said the medical teams on hand at the hotel were Gulf Air
staff trained to deal with the aftermath of aviation disasters.
</P>
<P>
   ''(Families) have dealt with probably everybody's worst
nightmare,'' she said. ''All we've tried to do is give them as much
comfort as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Beyond psychological trauma, medical workers were treating
physical effects of the grief and had a room set aside where people
could lie down or receive medical care.
</P>
<P>
   Most people were being treated for hysteria, heart problems and
hypertension, said Sister Karima Inneg, a Gulf Air nurse.
</P>
<P>
   She was not sure how many people had been treated. ''So many,''
she said, shaking her head.
</P>
<P>
   While waiting, relatives quietly held each other and accepted
hugs and comforting words from airline staff -- many of whom had
lost friends among the plane's crew.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air said 135 passengers and eight crew members were on
board. Sixty-three passengers were Egyptian, 34 Bahraini, 12 Saudi
Arabian, nine Palestinian, six from the United Arab Emirates, three
Chinese, two British and one each from Canada, Oman, Kuwait, Sudan,
Australia and the United States. Two crew members were Bahrainis
with one each from Oman, the Philippines, Poland, India, Morocco
and Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators from the U.S. National Transportation Safety
Board, French government experts and a representative of Airbus
Industries were to help determine the cause of the crash.
</P>
<P>
   Airline officials said they were preparing to send the flight
data and voice cockpit recorders to either Europe or the United
States for analysis. A spokesman said it could take weeks before
the data is revealed.
</P>
<P>
   Sheik Abdel-Aziz Ahmed Nada of Al-Azhar University in Cairo,
mainstream Islam's most prestigious institution, conducted a
special prayer service at the hotel for about 100 relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''You are crying, and it is a cry caused by separation,'' Nada
said as many relatives sobbed or buried their heads in their arms.
</P>
<P>
   ''Cry a cry of mercy. Cry a cry of separation. Cry like the
Prophet Mohammed, who cried for the loss of his son Ibrahim. Be
sad, but be sad out of mercy, out of the hurt of separation. Don't
be sad out of anger. Don't be sad in protest of God's will.''
</P>
<P>
   Nada, who arrived with the Egyptian relatives Thursday night,
described the victims as martyrs, a term traditionally reserved for
Muslims who die in holy war, but also used for victims of horrific
tragedy.

<HEADLINE> Groups Condemn Suu Kyi Detention  </HEADLINE>
By VIJAY JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Amnesty International has urged
Myanmar's military government to allow pro-democracy leader Aung
San Suu Kyi to travel unhindered, denouncing her detention outside
the capital as ''general harassment'' by the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement late Friday, the London-based human rights group
said the three-day standoff between Suu Kyi and the government is
another example of the military's attempt to stamp out ''all
peaceful opposition activities'' in Myanmar, also known as Burma.
</P>
<P>
   Winner of the 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, Suu Kyi was stopped by
security forces Thursday in Dala, a suburb outside the capital city
of Yangon. She and other party members were driving into the
countryside for organizational work. She was asked to return to
Yangon, but refused and has spent the last two nights in a Toyota.
</P>
<P>
   It was Suu Kyi's first attempt to leave Yangon in two years. In
similar standoffs with the military in 1998, she remained in her
car for nearly six days on one occasion and for 13 days on another.
</P>
<P>
   ''This level of surveillance and intimidation is all part of the
general harassment'' by the government against Suu Kyi's National
League for Democracy party, said Donna Guest of Amnesty
International.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's car and a pickup truck carrying 12 supporters were
herded into a small lane, which has been blocked by military trucks
on both ends, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The government claimed she was prevented from going any further
for her own protection, saying the area she was planning to visit
was rife with threats of violence by separatist insurgents.
</P>
<P>
   Security problems have rarely been reported in Kungyangon, 30
miles south of Yangon, where Suu Kyi was planning to go. The
National League for Democracy accused the government of detaining
her illegally.
</P>
<P>
   Guest noted that the State Peace and Development Council, as the
military government is called, has frequently claimed that Myanmar
is almost entirely free from insurgent activity and is a secure and
stable country.
</P>
<P>
   ''Amnesty International urges the SPDC to allow (Suu Kyi) and
other NLD members to travel freely,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   A Myanmar government statement released late Friday said Suu Kyi
and her companions ''continue to rest'' in Dala and ''the local
authorities make every effort to ensure their comfort and safety.''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the United States and Britain said they deplored the
military rulers' action.
</P>
<P>
   ''The U.S. condemns this abridgment of Aung San Suu Kyi's right
to freedom of movement and her right to visit whomever she
chooses,'' State Department spokesman Philip Reeker said.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters have not been allowed to go to Dala, which is
separated from the capital by the Yangon River. Journalists were
stopped by security forces at the ferry crossing and politely told
to go back.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, two National League for Democracy cars waited on
the Yangon side of the ferry crossing in case Suu Kyi decided to
return. Residents coming from Dala said there was little traffic on
the roads in the suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi is frequently at loggerheads with the military
government, which has ruled this Southeast Asian nation with an
iron fist since crushing a pro-democracy uprising she helped lead
in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi was put under house arrest in 1989. The order was lifted
in 1995, but her movements remain restricted. The government also
refuses to honor the results of the 1990 general elections in which
her party won a landslide.

President Olusegun Obasanjo that the United States supports Nigeria as it

   WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Navy is investigating allegations of ''inappropriate

Association, the naval aviators organization whose 1991 convention featured
scandalous episodes of drunken debauchery, property damage and sexual assaults.
The Navy severed its ties to the Tailhook Association after the 1991 incident
and just this year decided to resume sponsoring active-duty Navy and Marine
Corps aviators' attendance at the annual gathering, which is a combination of
aviation seminars, industry exhibits, parties, banquets and outdoor activities.

Bush Hopes To Emulate Fox Victory
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush is likening his campaign to
that of Mexican President-elect Vicente Fox, suggesting a similarity of tactics
and goals. He made a compelling case that the status quo was not going to be
acceptable any more, Bush said. If elected, he'll immediately seek a meeting
with Fox in November to demonstrate the importance he places on the U.S.-Mexican
relationship -- and dealings in general with Latin America. Earlier on Friday,
Bush spelled out his Latin American policy in a speech in Miami, saying that as
president ''I will look South, not as an afterthought, but as a fundamental
commitment of my presidency.''

Experts Probing Gulf Air Crash
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- As Gulf Air Flight 072 approached Bahrain
International Airport for a landing Wednesday, pilot Ihsan Shakeeb requested a
''go around'' from air traffic controllers. Shakeeb, an experienced pilot,
circled Bahrain International Airport once, then aborted his landing attempt
without explanation, according to Gulf Air officials. Moments later, the Airbus
320 -- and its 143 passengers and crew -- disappeared from the radar and
nose-dived. U.S. and Bahraini teams are expected are meeting with six French
government experts and a representative of Airbus Industries to determine the
cause of the crash.

Legionella Bacteria Found in Md.

   TOWSON, Md. (AP) -- Officials at St. Joseph Medical Center banned showers and

Legionnaire's disease. The hospital, just north of Baltimore, began treating the
hot water system Thursday after tests taken last week revealed elevated levels
of legionella bacteria, said hospital spokeswoman Linda Harder. Results from the

<HEADLINE> Bellaire Seeks Series Win  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Before the talk-show appearances are
set, before the parades are mapped out, the Little Leaguers from
Bellaire, Texas, have one more thing to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
   That's beating Maracaibo, Venezuela, in Saturday's Little League
World Series championship game.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, if you don't win tomorrow's game, you fall short of
winning what you come up here for,'' Bellaire manager Terry McConn
said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   That's a bit of a switch after Thursday, when McConn said
everything was gravy after winning the U.S. title.
</P>
<P>
   ''Winning the United States championship, I think I made that
comment because I wanted to make sure the boys knew that they had
won a really big game,'' McConn said.
</P>
<P>
   ''No, we want to win that game. We want to win the whole thing,
absolutely,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome, McConn said he's already received
inquiries from the staffs of Jay Leno's Tonight Show and David
Letterman's Late Night, and parades -- one in Houston, another in
Bellaire -- are already being organized.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's scaring me with everything I'm hearing about what's going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire is the sixth Texas team to reach the final and is
seeking to become the first U.S. South team to win the Series since
Marietta, Ga., in 1983. The last Texas team to win was Houston in
1966.
</P>
<P>
   If omens are an indication, Bellaire might have the edge. On the
team's flight to Pittsburgh, the pilot came back to meet with the
players, telling them he was a member of the '66 champions.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo has had an interesting ride to the championship game
as well.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with, their flight from Venezuela had to return home
because of mechanical problems.
</P>
<P>
   They've been flying high ever since, reaching the title game by
upsetting favored Tokyo in Thursday's international final.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was not really that surprised,'' said Luis Sanchez,
interpreting for Maracaibo manager Eduvino Quevedo. ''To become a
Latin American champion, you have to compete with 12 other
champions who play very aggressive baseball. You feel you are
prepared to go all the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Maestra-Maracaibo is the ninth Venezuelan team to reach
the Series, and second to get to the championship game after
Coquivacoa-Maracaibo won it all in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire and Maracaibo are evenly matched, particularly because
Bellaire ace Ross Haggard -- who dominated the Series with two wins
and a save -- is unavailable after pitching in Thursday's U.S.
final.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire (3-1) enters the game batting .256 for the Series, led
by Michael Johnson, who's 7-for-12 with three homers and four RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo (3-1), batting .230 as a team, has been led by Ruben
Mavarez, who is 4-for-10 with two homers and six RBIs.
</P>
<P>
   Quevedo, who's been concerned about the lack of offense, said
the team has been coming around.
</P>
<P>
   Neither manager is letting on who will start Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   McConn said he's got three -- Johnson, Drew Zizinia or Alex
Atherton -- to choose from, but won't say which one to allow them
all to get a good night's sleep.
</P>
<P>
   Quevedo said it's a choice between Junior Valero and Ruben
Mavarez, who each won a game in the preliminary round.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, meanwhile, has been the most laid back of all the
Bellaire players this week.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not really nervous because, really, our goal was just to
win district,'' Johnson said. ''And all of a sudden we got here. So
I don't really care if we win or lose.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Track Team Warned Of Drugs  </HEADLINE>
By BERT ROSENTHAL
<TEXT>
<P>
   COURAN COVE, Australia (AP) -- The first wave of
out-of-competition, no-notice Olympic drug testers has put the U.S.
track and field team on alert as the Sydney Games approach.
</P>
<P>
   While the team was working out on the Gold Coast on Wednesday,
10,000-meter runner Abdi Abdirahman was approached by
representatives of the Australian Sports Drug Agency to provide a
urine sample for testing.
</P>
<P>
   The agency and colleagues from Canada and Norway began drug
testing this week as part of the pregames testing of about 2,000
Olympic athletes, under the auspices of the World Anti-Doping
Agency (WADA).
</P>
<P>
   On Friday night, the U.S. athletes at the team's training camp
on this resort island were warned about the protocol used by the
testers, which men's coach John Chaplin objected to in the case of
Abdirahman.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have no objections to the testing as long as they follow
the rules,'' said Chaplin, who has conducted drug tests for 15
years for the International Amateur Athletic Federation, the world
governing body of the sport.
</P>
<P>
   ''If they give us written authorization, show us who they are
and tell our medical people what they want, then we'll cooperate
immediately. They can't just walk out on the field and start
talking to people.
</P>
<P>
   ''For security reasons, we have to know who they are. They have
to identify themselves. The athletes have to know who they are so
they are valid.''
</P>
<P>
   Dick Strand, one of the team's doctors, handed out drug
information and protocol procedures to the athletes, then addressed
the group in the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Australians are saying we're complaining about the
rules,'' Strand said, ''but it was the sloppy way in which they
approached things. We were unhappy with the selection process of
the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since then, we've had three conversations with the Australian
drug agency.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the Australian Sports Drug Agency, Vicki
Kapernick, said the tester at the U.S. team's workout followed
proper procedures by going straight to the athlete.
</P>
<P>
   Kapernick said athletes can have a team representative accompany
them to the test, as Abdirahman did.
</P>
<P>
   That's what team manager Fred Newhouse stressed to the athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ''If a drug tester approaches you, you want to find an event
coach right away or Dr. Strand,'' Newhouse said. ''We have nothing
to hide. We just want it done right.''
</P>
<P>
   Strand concurred.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are requesting the Australians to approach one of the team
doctors or a staff member so the process goes properly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Chaplin said every American athlete had to be tested within 90
days of the Olympics or they couldn't come to camp.
</P>
<P>
   Kapernick said track and field was one of 27 international
federations that agreed to out-of-competition, no-notice testing
before the games.

<HEADLINE> USOC To Review Wrestling Dispute  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG ALDEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LINCOLN, Neb. (AP) -- Two wrestlers embroiled in a two-month
dispute will have to wait until next week before learning who will
join the U.S. Olympic wrestling team.
</P>
<P>
   Keith Sieracki and Matt Lindland have both won rulings in the
past two weeks that they thought secured them as the 167&AMP;frac12;-pound
Greco-Roman wrestler on the U.S. team, only to see the decision
reversed.
</P>
<P>
   The case has seen more twisting and turning than the match that
started it all in June. The U.S. Olympic Committee will decide next
week who will be wrestling in Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   ''If this thing doesn't get resolved soon, there is no Sydney.
So it needs to be taken care of,'' said Lindland, a former Nebraska
wrestler and assistant coach who is working out with the U.S. team
in Colorado Springs, Colo. ''It's an awful long time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki beat Lindland 2-1 on a referee's decision after
overtime at the U.S. Olympic trials in Dallas. Lindland protested
the match that decided the best-of-3 series, saying Sieracki
tripped him, which is not allowed in Greco-Roman.
</P>
<P>
   ''This has been going on since I walked off the mat in Dallas,''
Lindland said. ''The match out there, it was ridiculous. I've never
protested a match in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   He protested this one, but was denied twice. Lindland then
appealed to an arbitrator, who ruled that there should be a
rematch. Lindland beat Sieracki 8-0 in the rematch Aug. 14, but
Sieracki filed his own appeal, claiming he was at a disadvantage
because he just returned from a tournament in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ''To me, it didn't mean anything except another practice match
on my way to the Olympics,'' Lindland said.
</P>
<P>
   Another arbitrator said Thursday that Sieracki was the rightful
entrant for the Sydney Games. But hours later, a federal appeals
court in Chicago said Lindland should get the Olympic berth.
</P>
<P>
   ''Besides my divorce, it's the most frustrating thing I've ever
been through. And my divorce was pretty frustrating,'' said
Sieracki, an MP in the U.S. Army who is also continuing to train in
Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm probably still close to weight considering I'm a worry
wart. I'm going to train as if I'm going, it's only thing you can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   The official deadline to submit Olympic rosters was Friday, but
the USOC planned to review the tangle of rulings along with the
entry rules and deadlines over the weekend, USOC spokesman Mike
Moran said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Sieracki said there was a rivalry between the two before it went
to the courts. He doesn't hold anything against Lindland.
</P>
<P>
   ''He feels he's doing what's right,'' Sieracki said. ''I'm not
saying he was wrong to appeal. But I've always felt you were
supposed to leave it all on the mat, not in the courts.''

<HEADLINE> Webb Sets LPGA 36-Hole Record  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Meg Mallon felt like somebody was
spoiling her party, and that somebody was Karrie Webb.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was like the two of us were pushing each other on to lap
the field,'' said Mallon, who had a great view of Webb's
record-breaking display of golf Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Webb matched the LPGA's 18-hole record with an 11-under-par 61
in the second round of the Oldsmobile Classic. That left her at
17-under 127, breaking the 36-hole LPGA record of 16 under by
Michelle McGann last year in the Hermitage Golf Course in Old
Hickory, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, whose course-record of 10 under on the 6,241-yard Walnut
Hills Country Club lasted only one day, bogeyed the ninth, her
final hole of the day, for 68 and a two-round total of 130.
</P>
<P>
   ''One day!'' said Mallon, who needed 30 putts, compared with 23
in the first round. ''She's spoiled more than a few parties of
mine.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I kind of feel bad for Meg, being at 15-under and not
leading,'' said Webb, who took a 3-stroke lead into Saturday's
third round.
</P>
<P>
   Webb already owns the LPGA records for 54 holes (22 under) and
72 holes (26 under). Lisa Walters set the Oldsmobile Classic record
with a winning score of 23 under in 1998. That mark is likely to be
shattered before the third round is over.
</P>
<P>
   The shootout between Webb and Mallon was to be expected. Between
them, they have won three of the LPGA's four majors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Obviously, we're both playing ultra-good golf now,'' said
Mallon, winner of the du Maurier two weeks ago. ''You can't make a
bogey out here. If you do, you feel like you'll fall back by a
touchdown.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, the LPGA's leading money-winner at $1.5 million, lists The
Nabisco Championship and the U.S. Women's Open among her five tour
victories this season.
</P>
<P>
   ''Low rounds are always in the back of your mind,'' Webb said.
''But you can't say you're going to go out and do that. You know,
62 or 63 is still a great round.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb, starting the day four shots behind Mallon and two back of
McGann, wasted no time letting the rest of the field know the chase
was on. Playing in a threesome just ahead of Mallon's group, she
knocked a wedge within 4 feet for birdie at No. 10, her first hole
of the day.
</P>
<P>
   That set the tone for a record-shattering afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Webb turned at 11 under, yet still trailed Mallon by one. But
not for long. Birdies at Nos. 2, 4 and 5 got Webb to 14 under, tied
with Mallon.
</P>
<P>
   At the sixth, a 460-yard hole the women play as a par 5, Webb
hit a 5-wood within 15 feet of the pin. As her eagle putt curled
its way toward the cup, Webb yelled at the ball to stay on line.
</P>
<P>
   She pumped her fist when the ball hit the bottom of the cup,
putting Webb at 16 under -- and alone in the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think I knew how special the round was until I had
that putt for eagle,'' Webb said. ''Then it dawned on me.
</P>
<P>
   ''When I made that putt, I thought that if I didn't get 59, I at
least wanted to get 61, because I knew that was a record for our
tour.''
</P>
<P>
   Annika Sorenstam shot 11-under 61 last year in the first round
of the Sara Lee Classic at Old Hickory. Vicki Fergon also shot 11
under in 1984, but that was for 62 on a par-73 course in San Jose,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just a great feeling, just to put yourself in position
to even think about numbers like that,'' Webb said.
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the field was in another universe. Jenny Lidback was
seven shots behind Webb and four behind Mallon after shooting 68
for 134. Luciana Bemvenuti shot 67 for 135.
</P>
<P>
   McGann, who could do no wrong during the first round, had
nothing but trouble during the second. She followed her 64 with a
74 for 138.

<HEADLINE> Tiger Woods Leads NEC Invitational  </HEADLINE>
By DOUG FERGUSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Phil Mickelson promises a fight. Everything
else points to surrender.
</P>
<P>
   Tiger Woods was so locked into his game Friday in the NEC
Invitational that he had no idea he was 8 under through 12 holes.
He said he never heard the gallery screaming ''59!'' as he walked
down the fairways and had no idea he tied a course record at
Firestone.
</P>
<P>
   ''I just knew it was a 61,'' Woods said.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone must recognize it as something much more than that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Phenomenal,'' Colin Montgomerie said. ''I can only see the gap
widening, and good luck to him.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Woods was finished, he had rounds of 64-61 to take a
7-stroke lead over Mickelson after two rounds of the $5 million
World Golf Championship tournament.
</P>
<P>
   The 61 tied the Firestone record set by Jose Maria Olazabal in
the 1990 World Series of Golf. Woods' 36-hole total of 125 broke
the PGA Tour record of 126 previously held by six players, from
Tommy Bolt in 1954 to David Frost in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The only surprise was that it came so close after Woods went
through an emotionally draining week at Valhalla Golf Club, where
he had to birdie the last two holes to get into a playoff and then
hold off Bob May to win the PGA Championship.
</P>
<P>
   It was his third straight major, his third straight record score
in a major.
</P>
<P>
   The majors are done for the year, but Woods apparently isn't.
And Mickelson, while he wasn't about to concede the tournament, was
smart enough to recognize one thing.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's taking a lot more under par to win the tournaments now,''
Mickelson said.
</P>
<P>
   The 7-stroke lead is the largest of Woods' career, and the
largest on tour since Olazabal led by nine strokes at Firestone in
1990. Only four other players have had a 125 in consecutive rounds,
but not the first two.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's been playing so well, it's not like we're in shock,''
said Jim Furyk, who played with Woods on Friday -- or at least
walked in the same fairway as Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Justin Leonard had a 67 and was at 133, while Furyk had a 69 and
was another stroke back.
</P>
<P>
   The 37-man field is for Presidents Cup and U.S. Ryder Cup team
members, plus the top 12 Europeans from the European tour money
list. It is a small gathering of elite players, but Woods is in a
class by himself.
</P>
<P>
   His approach shots hit their mark as easily as a someone
shooting free throw. Drives were long and shaped perfectly down the
tree-lined fairways of Firestone. Woods played out the shots in his
mind, and executed them to near perfection.
</P>
<P>
   ''You have an idea of where you want to put the golf ball,'' he
said. ''When you're able to do that, that's when the game looks
easy.''
</P>
<P>
   And that makes Mickelson's work extra difficult, even though he
bristled when asked whether the tournament effectively was over.
</P>
<P>
   ''A little disappointing you would even bring that up,'' said
Mickelson, who had a 66. ''One of my thought processes was,
'Listen, if I can make some birdies, I can get in the final group.'
I think there's some real benefits to that.''
</P>
<P>
   At this rate, about all he can hope for are free lessons.
</P>
<P>
   Woods had a 6-stroke lead after 36 holes in the U.S. Open and
went on to win by 15. He led by three strokes at the halfway mark
of the British Open and won by eight. His strategy for the weekend?
</P>
<P>
   ''My game plan is really not complicated,'' Woods said. ''Hit a
lot of fairways, a lot of greens and try to make putts.''
</P>
<P>
   Easily said. And for two days, easily done.
</P>
<P>
   In a sensational round, Woods saved his best for No. 16, a
625-yard hole known as ''The Monster.''
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Woods nailed his drive, but decided against going
for the green from 285 yards away. He also noticed that a little
more to the right, and his drive would catch a slope. So the next
day, he aimed a little more right, caught the slope and wound up
only 269 yards from the pin.
</P>
<P>
   ''Go for it,'' screamed the gallery, perhaps aware that only
three players have ever reached the green in two during competition
-- Arnold Palmer, Raymond Floyd and John Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Make it four.
</P>
<P>
   Woods caught his 2-iron as pure as can be, slapped hands with
caddie Steve Williams and watched as the ball landed 8 feet
directly behind the flag, then bounced twice into thick ground
behind the green.
</P>
<P>
   ''I only had 256 to carry, which I know I can hit that if I hit
it solid,'' Woods said. ''The hard part was a slight downhill lie,
which meant that I really had to stay committed to the shot, and
possibly even release it a little early to get some more loft on
it. I hit it flush.''
</P>
<P>
   His chip grazed the lip of the cup for a tap-in birdie.
</P>
<P>
   Woods has had at least a share of the lead in his last six
rounds, and 16 of his last 25 dating to the second round of the
Memorial. It also was his 29th consecutive round at par or better,
the longest streak since the PGA Tour began keeping such statistics
in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   When will it end?
</P>
<P>
   ''I really don't feel it is a streak,'' Woods said. ''I feel
like I'm just playing well. I think if I work hard and have a lot
of patience and manage my game well, I can play this game at a high
level for a long period of time.''

<HEADLINE> U.N. Denies Dalai Lama Exclusion  </HEADLINE>
By EDITH M. LEDERER
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- Secretary-General Kofi Annan did not
exclude the Dalai Lama from a conference of world religious leaders
and shares the disappointment of those who hoped he would
participate, a U.N. spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 religious leaders have been invited to the
Millennium World Peace Summit from Aug. 28-31, part of which will
be held in the U.N. General Assembly chamber even though the United
Nations is not an official sponsor.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard had confirmed that the Dalai Lama,
winner of the 1989 Nobel Peace Prize, was left off the invitation
list for fear his presence would draw protest from China. But
Eckhard said Friday that organizers of the gathering -- not the
United Nations -- decided whom to invite.
</P>
<P>
   The conference was organized by a coalition of interfaith
leaders and has received funding from Ted Turner's U.N. Foundation,
the Better World Fund and others. It is being held on the sidelines
of the U.N. Millennium Summit, which more than 150 world leaders
are expected to attend from Sept. 6-8.
</P>
<P>
   The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhists. He
fled Tibet in 1959 after a failed revolt against Chinese rule of
the mountain region.
</P>
<P>
   Annan said Thursday that ''many people are understandably and
deeply disappointed that the Dalai Lama will not be here for the
religious summit next week.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But let me also say that this house is really a house for the
member states and their sensitivities matter,'' Annan said. ''In
any effort of this kind, you try to make progress, take progress as
you get it, and not hold out for the absolute best.''
</P>
<P>
   Organizers invited the Dalai Lama to give the closing address to
the summit at a New York hotel, but he declined because he was left
out of the main conference. He is sending a delegation of three
senior religious leaders to represent him.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a religious summit, not a political one, and the
secretary-general hopes all the participants will act in the spirit
of the interfaith dialogue that is the goal of this meeting,''
Eckhard said.

<HEADLINE> Megawati Swears in Indonesia Cabinet  </HEADLINE>
By GEOFF SPENCER
<TEXT>
<P>
   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) -- In a sign of restored unity,
Indonesia's vice president swore in a new Cabinet on Saturday,
which embattled President Abdurrahman Wahid hopes will lift his
sagging political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   At Wahid's request, Vice President Megawati Sukarnoputri
officiated at the ceremony at Jakarta's ornate state palace. He
attended, but was unable to read the oath of office because he is
almost blind.
</P>
<P>
   Megawati's participation was significant after days of feuding
over the composition of the 26-member Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   It also was her first official duty since Wahid bowed to
pressure from critics and conferred greater responsibilities on
her. A presidential decree defining her role was read at the start
of Saturday's ceremony, which was nationally televised.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Wahid nor Megawati talked about their recent differences
during the brief ceremony. Wahid said recently he would remain in
ultimate control of the government, saying Megawati has been given
new tasks, not new powers.
</P>
<P>
   Several ministers said they hoped the Cabinet could push forward
with reforms, following three decades of authoritarian rule under
ex-President Suharto, who is slated to face trial for corruption on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   New Economics Coordinating Minister Rizal Ramli said he had
spoken by telephone to Stanley Fischer, deputy head of the
International Monetary Fund, which is overseeing the restructuring
of Indonesia's crisis-ridden economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''The response from the IMF to the new Cabinet is very
positive,'' said Ramli, who has previously criticized IMF policies
toward Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   New Defense Minister Mahfud M.D. said he would continue to
pursue democratic reforms within the military.
</P>
<P>
   Until now, Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's founding
President Sukarno and a popular pro-democracy figure in her own
right, has been sidelined from the inner workings of the government
even though she leads the largest party in the national parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Wahid and Megawati have been strained in
recent months as their fractious 10-month-old coalition government
failed to fix a deep economic crisis or end bloody sectarian and
separatist violence in several troubled provinces.
</P>
<P>
   Their differences came to a head Wednesday when she boycotted
Wahid's announcement of the new Cabinet lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Later her aides publicly criticized Wahid for stacking the new
Cabinet with his own supporters while excluding senior Megawati
backers from key positions.
</P>
<P>
   Wahid has defended his choice of ministers. He has said the new
ministerial team would be more professional than the 35-member
Cabinet he appointed last October when he became Indonesia's first
democratic leader in four decades.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-year-old president, weakened by a series of strokes,
promised to reshuffle his administration and enhance Megawati's
role after Indonesia's top assembly threatened to impeach him
earlier this month.

<HEADLINE> 8 Survive Small Plane Crash  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HILO, Hawaii (AP) -- A small sightseeing plane with one of its
engines apparently on fire crashed into the Pacific Ocean. Eight
people were pulled safely from the water, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   A ninth person remained missing Friday night after rescuers
suspended their search because of darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The nine-seat Piper Navajo Chieftain was approaching Hilo
International Airport when the pilot said he was going to ditch it
in the ocean off Honoli'i Point, about four miles from the airport.
</P>
<P>
   The plane went down at least 200 yards from shore at about 5:30
p.m. Friday, the Hawaii County Fire Department said. The aircraft
belonged to the tour and charter company Big Island Air.
</P>
<P>
   Company owner Tom Beard said the flight originated from
Keahole-Kona International Airport, on the other side of Hawaii
Island, and was on a sightseeing tour of the island. He refused to
provide any other details.
</P>
<P>
   There were reports of burning fuel after the plane hit the
water. Another plane reported seeing five people in a life raft
before the wreckage sank in more than 100 feet of water.
</P>
<P>
   Four survivors were taken by helicopter to Hilo Medical Center,
while the other four were rescued by boat. The missing person was a
passenger, said Bruce Nelson, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation
Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The eight survivors -- five men and three women -- all appeared to
be in satisfactory condition, hospital nursing supervisor Steve
Palmore said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It looks like everyone is going to be fine,'' Palmore said.
</P>
<P>
   A National Transportation Safety Board official was expected on
Hawaii Island on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The search for the ninth passenger was to resume Saturday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   This is the second plane crash involving Big Island Air within
the last year. On Sept. 25, a twin-engine sightseeing plane crashed
on the slopes of the Mauna Loa volcano, killing all 10 people on
board.
</P>
<P>
   The NTSB has not ruled on the cause of that crash, but radar
data showed the pilot of that plane, also a Piper Navajo Chieftain,
was flying off the normal course used for sightseeing flights.

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Search Straits of Malacca  </HEADLINE>
By ALVIN UNG
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Rescuers searched the Straits of
Malacca for survivors and bodies Saturday after a crowded boat
capsized on its way from Indonesia to Malaysia, a maritime official
said.
</P>
<P>
   There was no official word on fatalities, but news reports said
most of the missing passengers, many of them women, may have
drowned in the rough seas.
</P>
<P>
   The fiberglass fishing boat, carrying an estimated 80 people,
was bound for Malaysia from Dumai, Indonesia when it capsized in
strong waves Wednesday night. Merchant vessels alerted marine
police to the accident on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Officials believe the ship was carrying Indonesians who were
trying to illegally enter Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   At least 26 Indonesians were rescued by passing ships, said S.
Arumugam, an officer of Kuala Lumpur's Maritime Rescue and
Coordinating Center.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are not sure whether anyone has drowned so far. We have not
found any bodies,'' Arumugam said. ''Because they are illegal
immigrants, they might have tried to make their own way back to
Indonesian shores.''
</P>
<P>
   Six people who were rescued by Malaysian boats were admitted to
a hospital near Port Dickson, about 35 miles south of Kuala Lumpur,
the New Straits Times said. One was being questioned by police, it
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were trapped in the cabin when the boat capsized,'' the
daily quoted Holimah Toyabin, 25, a woman from Indonesia's East
Java, as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia, a country of 22 million, employs nearly 2 million
foreign workers, mostly from Indonesia. Thousands of Indonesians
also work illegally in Malaysia, mostly as house maids and
construction laborers.
</P>
<P>
   Police routinely arrest illegal immigrants and deport them
across the 45-mile stretch of water that separates peninsular
Malaysia from Indonesia's Sumatra island.

<HEADLINE> Black Farmers Wait on Settlements  </HEADLINE>
By KIA SHANT'E BREAUX
<TEXT>
<P>
   RICHMOND, Va. (AP) -- Some black farmers say the government has
been stingy and slow about issuing payments from last year's
settlement of a lawsuit alleging decades of racial discrimination
in federal lending practices.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Agriculture won court approval in April
1999 for the settlement of the suit filed on behalf of black
farmers who claimed they had been systematically discriminated
against for years when they applied for loans and subsidy programs.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 21,073 farmers who have filed claims, 18,239, or 87
percent, had received decisions as of Monday. So far, 11,025
claims, or 60 percent, have been approved, while the remaining
7,214 claims have been denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think a lot of these denials have not been fair,'' said John
Boyd, president of National Black Farmers Association, which held a
panel discussion Friday on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 farmers and supporters attended the three-hour
session, part of the association's annual meeting, along with a
USDA official and the court-appointed monitor of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have documented proof that we were discriminated against,
but they are still denying us what we are due,'' said George
Hildebrandt, 59, of Leavenworth, Kan., whose claim was denied.
</P>
<P>
   Rosalind Gray, director of the USDA's Office of Civil Rights,
said independent parties are deciding the claims. While she
admitted there have been some problems and delays, Gray said the
department is committed to settling the case.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not saying we're perfect, but we will continue to ... make
sure the appropriate action is taken by the USDA,'' Gray said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deal, farmers who can show evidence of discrimination
are entitled to $50,000 each and to have some outstanding loans
forgiven. So far, payments totaling more than $357 million have
been made to 7,143 people. Another 3,882 claims have been approved,
but not yet paid.
</P>
<P>
   About 200 people who believe they have stronger discrimination
evidence are seeking higher levels of damages. In the end, lawyers
say the settlement could amount to as much as $2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Farmers whose claims were denied can ask the monitor to review
the case. The monitor can request a re-examination of a farmer's
claim, but cannot change decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer John Bonner of Dinwiddie received his $50,000 payment
last month, but his father and brother who worked with him were
denied.
</P>
<P>
   ''Although I've gotten mine, I'm still in the fight because I
think the government is doing them wrong,'' Bonner said. ''In
actuality, $50,000 is not a lot of money in comparison to what
black farmers in this country have been through. They could never
repay us.''

<P>
   LEIPERS FORK, Tenn. (AP) -- Fans had a field day at country music
star Wynonna Judd's garage sale.
</P>
<P>
   A steady stream of cars Friday trickled in and out of Judd's
estate south of Nashville, and pickings were already getting slim
after the first few hours. The sale was scheduled to run through
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''She's sold the house and is building her dream house on 500
acres she owns next to where her mother and sister live down the
road,'' said Kerry Hansen, Wynonna's spokeswoman. ''Meanwhile,
she'll be living in a smaller house that has no room for most of
this stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the items for sale were stage clothing, shoes, books,
furniture, Christmas decorations, household appliances and
memorabilia. A restored 1949 Ford pickup truck was priced at
$35,000.
</P>
<P>
   ''She knows a lot of neighbors might want some of the stuff,''
Hansen said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Arrives in Africa  </HEADLINE>
By ANNE GEARAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Whirling dancers in flowing, red and black
African dress greeted President Clinton as he began a three-day
trip to Africa that the White House hopes will embrace democracy in
Nigeria and encourage peace elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   With a wave, Clinton and his daughter, Chelsea, walked down the
steps of Air Force One into bright, West African sunshine Saturday
morning. Clinton then walked alongside Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo as they watched the dancers and others gathered at the
shiny new airport outside Nigeria's capital city.
</P>
<P>
   Later Saturday, Clinton was meeting with Obasanjo and speaking
to the country's new democratic parliament.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton left Washington, the White House announced that he
will add a stop in Cairo Tuesday morning local time to meet with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, a Middle East ally.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two leaders will discuss the latest developments in the
Middle East peace process,'' White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre
said. Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was meeting with Egyptian
officials Saturday in Alexandria, Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria, Clinton plans to announce additional assistance for
primary schools and disease prevention, fattening an aid package
that has grown from $7 million to $108 million in two years.
</P>
<P>
   A $4.3 million aid package is designed to support Nigeria's
transition from a military dictatorship to a democracy, U.S.
officials said. Transportation Secretary Rodney Slater also planned
to announce $4.5 million for transportation improvements in
Nigeria, and he planned to sign an ''open skies'' agreement that
eases travel problems between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson is also along. The United
States is interested in buying more and cheaper oil from Nigeria,
which exports more than $9 billion in petroleum annually. In return
for a lower price, Obasanjo is expected to request a reduction or
cancellation of Nigeria's international debt.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security adviser, said the aid
is necessary because the 15-month-old democratic government in
Nigeria is at a delicate stage.
</P>
<P>
   The country has been trying to restore public faith in
government with an aggressive attack on corruption and efforts to
manage the nation's oil wealth in a more responsible way. It also
faces tensions between its diverse religious and ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a make-or-break transition, not just for Nigeria but
for Africa,'' Berger said before the trip. ''If Nigeria succeeds,
this can help lift the whole region to prosperity and peace. If it
fails, it can swamp the whole region in turmoil and misery.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton plans to prod Obasanjo toward a more cooperative working
relationship with his parliament. Clinton also plans to discuss the
imposition of Islamic law in several northern states -- a situation
that threatens to plunge Nigeria into a constitutional crisis.
</P>
<P>
   The president will see very little of Nigeria, stopping only in
Abuja and a village just outside the city. He then will move on to
Tanzania to show solidarity with former South African President
Nelson Mandela's efforts to broker peace between warring Hutus and
Tutsis in Burundi. From there he makes the brief stop in Cairo
before returning to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Secret HIV Tests Alleged in S.Africa  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) -- More than 50 physicians here
are accused of testing people for HIV without their knowledge or
consent -- and then passing on the result to the patients' employer,
media reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The University of Witwatersrand's AIDS Law Project has filed
complaints against the doctors with the Health Practitioners
Association of South Africa. The tests were performed at the
request of the patients' employers, the Saturday Star newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
   Most patients did not receive counseling before or after the
test, the group said, adding that in some cases, test results were
sent directly to the employer and the patient was not informed
about the result.
</P>
<P>
   A positive result meant almost certain dismissal, the group
said. In a fifth of the cases, the employee was a domestic worker.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's nothing less than total discrimination,'' said Jennifer
Joni, an attorney with the project. ''The doctor is not concerned
with the well-being of the patient, just the continued loyalty of
the employer who wants to know if their employee is HIV positive.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Health Practitioners Association's rules, HIV
tests can be performed without a patient's consent only if a health
professional has been exposed to infection by a needle-stick
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians in violation of the association's rules face a
warning, reprimand, a fine of less than $1,450, and suspension or
removal from the medical register.
</P>
<P>
   About 4.2 million South Africans -- roughly 10 percent of the
population -- are HIV positive.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Opens Teacher Matching Site  </HEADLINE>
By LAWRENCE L. KNUTSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Moving to address a national teacher gap,
President Clinton on Saturday launched a one-stop Internet
clearinghouse to help schools find qualified teachers and help
teachers find out where the jobs are.
</P>
<P>
   ''All across our nation school districts are looking for a new
generation of dedicated teachers,'' Clinton said in his weekly
radio address, recorded before his departure for Africa on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   ''By logging on to www.recruitingteachers.org, school districts
can find qualified teachers and teachers can find out where the
jobs are,'' he said. ''This will transform what has been a
hit-or-miss process into a more efficient, effective exchange of
information.
</P>
<P>
   ''And over time this (Web) site will help us alleviate the
national teacher shortage and to bring down class size,'' the
president said. ''By working together as communities and a nation,
we can meet the growing need for more teachers in our classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said that when the bells signal the start of classes in
schools around the country Monday morning, ''a record 53 million
students will fill our classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Unfortunately, thousands of school districts are struggling to
find enough teachers to fill them,'' Clinton said. ''Over the next
decade America will need to hire 2.2 million new teachers both to
handle rising enrollment and to replace those teachers set to
retire.''
</P>
<P>
   The president noted that his pending education budget includes
$1 billion to recruit and train high-quality teachers and an
additional $1.75 billion to pursue his goal of hiring 100,000
qualified teachers to reduce class size in the early grades.
</P>
<P>
   ''Since 1998 we've helped local schools hire a third of that
total and this year we've asked Congress for funding to reach
50,000,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Studies show what parents already know; students perform
better in smaller classes with more individual attention and
greater discipline,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton said Congress needs to pass an education budget that
provides the means to continue to cut class size and increase
teacher quality.
</P>
<P>
   ''I also urge Congress to take prompt action on our proposal to
help local school districts to tackle the enormous challenge of
modernizing old schools and building new ones,'' he said. ''It is
high time that we get our children out of trailers and into
twenty-first century classrooms.''

</P>
<P>
   Clinton boycotted Nigeria on his first visit to Africa. This
time, he said, he was happy to visit a budding democracy ''worthy
of its people's dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When I came here two years ago, one of the biggest obstacles
to a new relationship with the entire continent was the fact that
the democratic hopes of Nigeria's people were being smothered by
military misrule and corruption with your finest leaders being
killed, banished or, in the case of President Obasanjo, forced to
languish in prison,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   His visit this time is the realization of ''my greatest hope.''
</P>
<P>
   Answering questions, Clinton said he did not have hopes for a
Mideast breakthrough resulting from his hastily arranged stop in
Egypt on the way home.
</P>
<P>
   He is going to Egypt because peace between the Israelis and the
Palestinians without the support of President Hosni Mubarak is
''inconceivable.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't think you should read too much'' into his Cairo visit
''other than that we are working with a sense of urgency given the
timetable the parties have set for themselves,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   The visit to Cairo was announced Friday as Clinton left
Washington.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Congressman Decries Inheritance Tax  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican congressman appealed to fellow
legislators Saturday for bipartisan cooperation to overturn
President Clinton's expected veto of legislation to eliminate the
inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats and Republicans alike know that the death tax is
unfair to family farmers and unfair to small businesspeople of
every kind,'' Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., said in the Republicans'
weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax repeal will cost the government $104 billion over
10 years. Clinton has promised to veto the legislation, probably
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the package of tax cuts the
Republican-controlled Congress passed this year would all but
consume the nation's projected budget surpluses outside the Social
Security Trust Fund, leaving nothing for ''other national
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said farmers' surviving children are taxed unfairly
because of the worth of their land, and small business owners are
hurt trying to leave legacies to their children.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tax also hurts the high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these brilliant folks started out playing with ideas
in their garages, with few resources to invest,'' he said. ''Now
they've created something they can pass on to their children, so
they can live in greater comfort. The government shouldn't punish
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote of 59-39 was well short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override a presidential veto, but Dickey said
''we intend'' to challenge a Clinton rejection of the bill. In the
House, 65 Democrats jumped ship to help Republicans win a 279-136
vote for repeal of the tax by 2010. It would take 290 votes in the
House to override a veto if all 435 members voted, or just over
half the 20 who did not vote this month.

<HEADLINE> Fatal fire still unsolved, Seton Hall heading back to classes  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - When Alyssa Merla heads back to Seton
Hall to begin her sophomore year, she'll have the usual
back-to-school things on her mind: Will I like my dorm? How much
will textbooks cost? Which classes will be the toughest?
</P>
<P>
   But she'll have something else on her mind as well: the memory
of flames illuminating the dark hallway of her dorm; choking smoke
pouring into her room; waiting what seemed like an eternity for
rescuers to arrive; and deciding she and a friend had to brave the
smoke and run to safety or die in their room.
</P>
<P>
   Merla was one of hundreds of freshmen roused from sleep on the
morning of Jan. 19 when a fire broke out on the third floor of
Boland Hall, Seton Hall's on-campus housing for first-year
students. Three students were killed, and 62 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   With a new school year set to begin this week at the state's
only Roman Catholic University, the cause of the blaze remains
undetermined, and rumors that as many as three students may have
started it continue to circulate. The Essex County Prosecutor's
Office will only say the fire remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unnamed sources, has
reported that investigators are focused on three Seton Hall
students who they believe either set the fire or know about it. The
newspaper reported that one of the students admitted vandalizing
the lounge where the fire originated, but not to setting the blaze.
The investigation stalled when the suspects stopped talking to
police, sources told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   That led police to stage a raid on a Newark bar popular with
Seton Hall students a month after the blaze, allegedly to crack
down on underage drinking. But lawyers for some of the 20 students
arrested said authorities issued subpoenas to a half-dozen students
wanted for questioning about the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty and the lack of closure to a traumatic event
still weigh heavily on the minds of students who survived the
blaze. They may wonder: Is that guy next to me in literature class
a killer?
</P>
<P>
   ''That aspect of it can be scary, not knowing what caused it, if
it was one of my fellow students,'' said Nick Donato of Sparta, who
broke his wrist and ankle jumping from the third floor to escape
the flames. He still has to go for regular physical therapy. He has
sudden flashes of pain and walks with a slight limp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he and others who survived the blaze are looking forward to
the new semester and have a generally upbeat attitude about their
sophomore year. They cite $4.5 million worth of sprinklers Seton
Hall installed in its dorms, a new awareness of fire safety, and
the support of others who've gone through what they experienced.
Freshmen move in on Thursday; classes begin on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very optimistic about school,'' said Merla, of West Long
Branch. ''The sprinklers are in, and I've got wonderful friends
that support me. There's no real fear of going back in anyone's
mind, but we're definitely all thinking of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merla said not knowing what caused the fire is hard for Seton
Hall students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We basically don't know anything,'' she said. ''But I'm not
going to go into class thinking, 'He could have done it, or she
could have done it.' We're all trying to have a good feeling about
going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out in a third-floor lounge before dawn, filling
the floor with smoke and sending hundreds of terrified freshmen
staggering into the cold outside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, firefighters found the bodies of Frank Caltabilota of
West Long Branch, John Giunta of Vineland and Aaron Karol of Green
Brook. All were 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Merla said she waited in her room for a half hour for someone to
come rescue her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ''Somehow, I made it
out of there. I went through my suitemate's room, and we made a run
for it. I opened up the door, and I saw flames, and smoke was
spilling in like crazy, so I closed the door.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were yelling up from the ground to put towels under the
door, that there were firemen on the floor coming to get us, but
nobody was,'' she said. ''We were all terrified. We didn't know
what to do. We figured if we stayed there, we were going to die, so
we ran out into the hall and made a run for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato came to the same conclusion and decided to jump for his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was either that, or not make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all the students injured in the blaze who are medically able
to return to class will do so this fall, university spokeswoman
Shannon Allen said. None of those hurt in the blaze decided against
returning to Seton Hall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze cast a harsh spotlight on Seton Hall's fire safety
preparations. The university acknowledged that for years it didn't
hold organized fire drills as required by state codes, because it
believed that false alarms that resulted in evacuations counted as
the same thing. State investigators subsequently found hundreds of
fire safety violations at the campus, which Seton Hall says have
all been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen students, including the families of two of the dead
students, have filed notices indicating their intent to sue the
school over the fire, and seven plan to sue South Orange or other
governmental entities.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law requiring the
installation of automatic sprinkler systems in the state's private
and public school dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Seton Hall will have smoke detectors in each room,
plans at least one fire drill per semester, and will have floor
meetings in every dorm to review fire safety plans.
</P>
<P>
   And fire safety is now firmly ingrained in the consciousness of
many Seton Hall students. Merla asked to be assigned to a dorm room
no higher than the second floor; Donato will be on the ground floor
and already has memorized where the fire exits are.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bought a safety ladder,'' Merla said. ''I took a few safety
precautions I wouldn't have thought of last year.''

<HEADLINE> Trio of 22-year-olds aim to become youngest crew to fly around the world </HEADLINE>
By BEN DOBBIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) - At a recent air show in Oshkosh, Wis.,
several people sidled up to the ''World Flight 2000'' booth to ask
the young aviators the same, carefully phrased question: Do you
remember Jessica Dubroff?
</P>
<P>
   ''Each one was kind of looking at the ground when they asked,''
said Daniel Dominguez, irked to hear repeated mention of the
7-year-old girl who was killed in 1996 while trying to become the
youngest person to fly across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez, fellow pilot Chris Wall and photographer Jesse Weisz
are embarking from Rochester in a silver-bodied, twin-engine plane
Sept. 1 in a bid to become the youngest flight crew on record to
circle the globe.
</P>
<P>
   They all turned 22 this year. To some onlookers, notably a few
sponsors who held back on donations, that still doesn't seem nearly
old enough to be hopping across oceans, over icebergs and war
zones, through horizon-blotting clouds.
</P>
<P>
   The crew is downplaying the ''youngest'' aspect of the flight.
''It'd be a nice thing to set a record but it's not the reason the
flight's taking place,'' said Dominguez, who graduated in May with
an economics degree from the University of Rochester.
</P>
<P>
   More important is just the sheer adventure of steering
26,500-plus miles eastward in ''Dreamcatcher.'' Their 1957 Aero
Commander 560E is the same aircraft model once used to ferry
President Eisenhower to his Pennsylvania farm.
</P>
<P>
   Dominguez and Wall, who have logged thousands of flying hours
since getting their pilot's licenses at 17, bought the disused
plane with a $15,000 loan in 1998. They've refitted it themselves
with everything from new propellors to sophisticated avionics and
buffed it up like a mirror to reflect its surroundings.
</P>
<P>
   As teachers got wind of the project, schoolchildren frequently
showed up at the airport by the busload. They were encouraged to
climb into the cockpit, play with the controls, ask questions to
their heart's content. The lesson the crew wishes to impart: Work
hard enough at it, and big dreams can often be fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's always an excuse not to go after your dream,'' said
Wall, an engineering senior at Rice University in Houston. ''We've
got to do this now. We don't know if we'll have another opportunity
- we'll have too many ties, too many responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Weisz, a film studies graduate from South Orange, N.J., will
provide daily photo-and-video updates of the 3&AMP;frac12;-month trip on the
Internet. Youngsters will be able to follow the trio on excursions
to volcanoes, reefs, temples, marketplaces and historic homes from
Turkey to Fiji and Newfoundland to Nepal.
</P>
<P>
   The longest leg will be a 14-hour, 2,042-mile hop from Hawaii to
San Jose, Calif. Flying has ''inherent risks,'' Wall said, but he
worries more about foul-ups on the ground: landing-permit troubles,
getting stranded without an available spare part, or running into
''a guy with a machine gun asking questions in some weird
language.''
</P>
<P>
   The project is largely self-financed. Dominguez has been busy
flying freight, reporting rush-hour traffic jams for radio stations
and giving flying lessons. Wall has worked every spare minute as an
aircraft mechanic.
</P>
<P>
   Circumnavigating Earth isn't so much of a stretch for the pair
from El Paso, Texas, who have been aviation fanatics for as long as
they can remember. At age 17, they managed to persuade their
parents to let them fly alone from Texas to Alaska. ''Both our
parents have been very supportive, letting us go out and live our
lives,'' Wall said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1989, 11-year-old Tony Aliengena became the youngest pilot to
fly around the world. Jessica Dubroff died while trying to break
the U.S. cross-country record the California boy had set at age 9.
Both children were accompanied by their fathers and other adults.
</P>
<P>
   Aviation history buffs deem it highly unlikely that the oldest
crew member aboard any of the estimated 160 or so noncommercial
flights around the world since 1924 was as young as 22. Such
flights usually make no mention of the crew members' ages.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most round-the-world flights have been taken either by daring
fliers, people in military service or wealthy folks, and you don't
get into that realm without having some age under your belt,'' said
Joe Conger of Airchive, a history-of-flight repository in
Springfield, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   As for this project's cash crunch - it has drawn an abundance of
aircraft equipment and other supplies but less than $30,000 in
donations - Conger isn't surprised that sponsors turned out, to
Dominguez's amazement, to be ''so stingy.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It's only natural for grown-ups to disparage young people,''
he said. ''Most anyone over 30 who thinks 'Would I have the nerve
to do what these kids want to do?' decides 'Heck, no - they must be
crazy.'''
</P>
<P>
   Around-the-world flights were a big deal between the 1920s and
1940s ''when it was important just to prove it could be done - and
done faster and safer and to pioneer new aircraft and new
technologies,'' said Bob Van Der Linden, curator of aeronautics at
the National Air and Space Museum.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, he said, the world-weary attitude has become, ''If you
want to fly all the way around the world, then why leave?''

<HEADLINE> Schools complying with sprinkler law well before deadline  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN P. McALPIN
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - Eight months after the fatal dormitory fire
that inspired the law, several New Jersey schools have installed
sprinkler systems in all rooms, beating the deadline by almost four
years.
</P>
<P>
   A fire in January killed three students and injured 62 others
Seton Hall University in South Orange.
</P>
<P>
   Six months later Gov. Christie Whitman signed a bill requiring
every dormitory room in the state to be covered by the automatic
firefighting systems.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the bill became law, Rutgers, Rowan University in
Glassboro, William Paterson University in Wayne and Seton Hall
announced plans to put fire sprinklers in all or some dorm rooms by
fall.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, William Paterson completed its $1.9 million project
and installed sprinklers at the 1,000-bed Towers dormitory - the
only residence hall that lacked sprinklers.
</P>
<P>
   The College of New Jersey and the New Jersey Institute of
Technology are nearly finished installation work on those campuses,
said E.J. Miranda, a spokesman for the state's Department of
Community Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Work at many of New Jersey's colleges and universities is being
done before state regulations are finalized. The state plans to
notify schools of the law's details sometime in November, Miranda
said.
</P>
<P>
   After the regulations are posted, schools then are required to
provide the state a work schedule, Miranda said. Until the plans
are forwarded, the state has no idea just how many of the estimated
53,260 dormitory beds are covered by sprinklers, the spokesman
said.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once that's done, we will be able to keep track of where we
are and where we will be,'' Miranda explained
</P>
<P>
   But not all schools are able to install sprinklers immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Rider University needed to spend $1.6 million on improvements to
the water supply system in its Lawrenceville campus, said Tony
Campbell, the school's vice president for student affairs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In order to get the sprinklers in every room, we needed to do
the water system upgrades,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Rider is expected to begin sprinkler installation in the fall,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   That assumes the school can complete negotiations with
contractors and suppliers, a problem for several small schools, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   While the school waits to complete the sprinkler work, it has
taken steps to increase student safety, Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Each dorm room has a smoke detector hard-wired to the campus
security office, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The law gives schools four years to install sprinklers in every
room.
</P>
<P>
   The state also provided $90 million to help pay for the
sprinklers. Public and private colleges and universities would get
zero-interest loans, while boarding schools, military academies and
other schools that have dorms would have to repay the loans at 2
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The bill allows exemptions for certain buildings. That would
most likely apply to ''very small'' buildings, state officials have
said.

<HEADLINE> Much-criticized charter school readies for new school year  </HEADLINE>
By ANNY KUO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - Following a first year plagued by academic
and disciplinary troubles, the New Covenant Charter School is
entering the new school year with a new management company, a new
curriculum and a new director.
</P>
<P>
   The problems of the Albany school affirmed the warnings of
critics who said last year it was too big and going too fast. Now,
New Covenant's new managers have one thought in mind: Get the
school reopened right after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's the No. 1 focus,'' Director Eleanor Bartlett said.
''That's what I was hired for - to open this school.
</P>
<P>
   The school sent its amended charter to the State University
Board of Trustees just three weeks before its anticipated opening
date of Sept. 7. That document, totaling hundreds of pages, has to
be approved by the SUNY trustees and then sent to the state Board
of Regents, which can make comments or suggestions but not prevent
the school from opening.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear how long the ratification process will take.
</P>
<P>
   As backup, New Covenant's former management company,
Boston-based Advantage Schools Inc., has agreed to subcontract the
new manager, Edison Schools Inc. so that the school could operate
under its old charter while waiting for the new version to be
approved. But SUNY officials maintained that the school will not be
able to reopen until the new charter is adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Let's wait and see,'' said Connie Cullen, spokeswoman for
SUNY's Charter School Institute.
</P>
<P>
   New Covenant opened its doors in September 1999 as the largest
among the state's first three charter schools. Located in Albany's
predominantly black Arbor Hill neighborhood, just blocks from the
state Capitol, the school was also seen as a barometer by which
lawmakers could judge the charter school system.
</P>
<P>
   Charter schools are taxpayer-funded but operate with an
independent charter, or license, that spells out the school's
mission. They are offered as alternatives to parents dissatisfied
with traditional public school education.
</P>
<P>
   New Covenant's original charter was not finalized until
mid-August last year, when SUNY overrode the Board of Regent's
rejection of the charter and gave the go-ahead. Bartlett, a former
Regent who sat on the board that rejected the charter, acknowledged
that she questioned New Covenant's feasibility back then.
</P>
<P>
   ''The stability wasn't there. They had a new management company
coming in that had never worked in the state of New York,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   In its first year, New Covenant saw its student population drop
to 386 by June, well below the charter's projected goal of 550
students. In addition, 92 percent of the school's fourth graders
failed to meet the standards on the state's English test.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, the school's founder, Aaron Dare, first resigned
in June as the chairman of the board of trustees and then left the
board altogether in the wake of a state report alleging he
mishandled school funds.
</P>
<P>
   Separate critical reports released by the Charter School
Institute and the state Education Department this summer cited the
school's poor performance and management problems, as well as its
failure to create a permanent facility.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett said New Covenant's amended charter calls for the
switch from Advantage to Manhattan-based Edison and for the
problems stated in the reports to be corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, school officials had said that the school's modular
classrooms were temporary and had promised that a new, 50,000
square-foot building would be erected by November 1999. The site
for the permanent building is still vacant.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Jack McEneny, an Albany Democrat, said New Covenant
officials were too ambitious and hurried in starting the school.
</P>
<P>
   ''You need to start small and experiment, see how it works and
then expand on merit,'' McEneny said. ''You need to downsize the
ego first. It requires a certain degree of humility, and I don't
see that happening.''
</P>
<P>
   McEneny pointed out that the school could have renovated two
former school buildings that are now vacant in Albany and expand
from there.
</P>
<P>
   Ward DeWitt, co-chairman of the New Covenant Board of Trustees,
said that option ''was not something we actively pursued'' and
countered that renovations are usually a ''bigger headache'' than
building a new school.
</P>
<P>
   Edison now has a new blueprint - a three-story model with each
floor housing an ''academy'' to create ''smaller schools within a
school,'' said Marshall Mitchell, vice president of development.
Under the Edison structure, New Covenant will be divided into three
academies: elementary (kindergarten through grade two), primary
(grades three through five) and junior (grades six through eight).
</P>
<P>
   Edison is finalizing the design and construction should begin by
November. The building is expected to be completed by August 2001,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company is still working on a financing plan for the new
facility. In the meantime, Edison is willing to draft a letter of
credit for New Covenant, Mitchell added.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have 79 schools in the country, so we do have some
experience in developing schools,'' Mitchell said.
</P>
<P>
   The school's target enrollment has been lowered to about 400, a
figure more in line with the limited capacity of the modular
classrooms, Bartlett said. This year, the school will enroll
students in grades K-six.
</P>
<P>
   Bartlett has also met with Albany City School District
Superintendent Lonnie Palmer to discuss cooperative efforts, like
sharing lunch programs and custodial services.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said New Covenant's approval last year came too late in
the summer.
</P>
<P>
   ''Financially, it was a big hit for the community,'' Palmer
said. ''We cut everything we could possibly cut, and we still ended
up borrowing $2 million from the state'' to make up for aid which
went to New Covenant and not the city's school district.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer said Bartlett's appointment and the switch to Edison are
''two hopeful signs'' that New Covenant is finally on the right
track. Before becoming a Regent, Bartlett had worked with Palmer as
deputy superintendent of the district.
</P>
<P>
   ''The downside is, they're just starting to work. The time frame
is even shorter (than last year),'' Palmer said.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer estimates about nearly $4 million in public education aid
will be given to New Covenant this year if the school successfully
reopens.
</P>
<P>
   He said a shutdown of New Covenant will be a worse problem. The
district has used space vacated by students who went to New
Covenant to establish full-day kindergartens. The district is also
receiving federal aid by setting its class sizes at a set maximum.
If New Covenant students return, it could ''end up costing us a lot
of money,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New Covenant supporters are optimistic that it will not come to
that.
</P>
<P>
   ''Last year was a baseline. Now we know what we liked and what
we didn't like,'' said Seliatu Layeni, president of the New
Covenant's Parent-Teacher Organization.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Accongio, principal and superintendent of the Charter
School of Science and Technology in Rochester, said the public
should give cut charter schools ''a little slack because they're
doing something monumental.''
</P>
<P>
   The Charter School of Science and Technology, which is also
managed by Edison, will become the largest charter school in New
York when it opens in September with 924 students in grades
kindergarten through eight.
</P>
<P>
   A total of 12 new charter schools are opening across New York
this fall.

<HEADLINE> Campaign designed to boost Advanced Placement participation  </HEADLINE>
By JOEL STASHENKO
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The state's largest teachers' union has
entered into an alliance with the College Board to boost the
numbers of New York students taking Advanced Placement courses and
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Forty high school teachers received training this summer in
Advanced Placement English literature and calculus coursework under
the auspices of the College Board, the developers of AP materials
and tests, and the New York State United Teachers (NYSUT) union.
</P>
<P>
   The training is part of what the union said will be a
wide-ranging campaign to give more New York students, especially
those in inner cities and in rural areas, the opportunity to take
Advanced Placement courses. If students pass tests in various
subjects after taking the college-level course work in Advanced
Placement classes, they can qualify for college credits.
</P>
<P>
   ''The real winners will be the students in struggling districts
in rural and urban areas that have not been able to offer AP
courses,'' said Thomas Hobart, NYSUT's president. ''We are moving
closer to the goal of providing an opportunity for all students to
take challenging AP courses.''
</P>
<P>
   As things stand now, students in about three-quarters of New
York high schools can take at least one AP course. Last year, about
70,000 students in the state took one or more Advanced Placement
tests.
</P>
<P>
   Other aspects of the campaign to boost AP participation in New
York will be encouraging middle-school teachers to get students
involved in the College Board's pre-AP program and start bringing
course work in line earlier with AP courses students may face in
high school.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers do not receive extra money for AP courses, but many
like the challenge of teaching harder curriculum to what are
typically a school's better students, NYSUT spokeswoman Linda
Rosenblatt said.
</P>
<P>
   The president of the College Board, Gaston Caperton, said the
New York campaign will also address ''important equity'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   The College Board said it is trying to erase a disparity between
white and minority students who take one or more of the 32 Advanced
Placement tests it offers nationwide. Of some 700,000 students
taking tests last year, only 63,000 were Hispanic and 32,000 were
black. Black and Hispanic students make up nearly one-third of the
nation's public populations.
</P>
<P>
   The board, which has also faced charges of racial bias on the
SAT examinations it offers, says there is a disproportionately low
number of AP test-takers in inner city and rural districts.
</P>
<P>
   NYSUT said the state has also given the AP program a potential
boost by accepting grades of 3 of higher (on a scale of 1 to 5) on
the English, English literature and calculus tests as alternatives
to passing Regents tests offered in those subjects. The state Board
of Regents has started to phase in a new standard under which high
school students will have to pass five Regents examinations to get
a diploma.
</P>
<P>
   Low-income students in New York can qualify for aid to cover
part or all of the $77-per-test costs of AP examinations.
</P>
<P>
   But the AP system is not without its critics.
</P>
<P>
   In a study published this summer, Yale Professor Emeritus
William Lichten said the College Board misleads students by
promising that thousands of four-year colleges accept ''passing''
grades on AP tests for college credit.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Lichten said, something approaching half of American
colleges do not accept test scores of 3 as reflecting college-level
knowledge sufficient to earn college credit, and some of the most
exclusive schools have started not to accept 4s in some subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Lichten accused College Board administrators of being out of
touch with colleges by not recognizing that some institutions have
devalued AP tests and for not doing more to combat what he insists
is grade-inflation in the way AP tests are scored.
</P>
<P>
   The executive director of the AP program, Lee Jones, contended
that Lichten's research was flawed, as was his understanding of the
attitude of colleges toward AP exams.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said he has been told flat-out by some administrators that
the decision to curtail the acceptance of AP tests for credit is
purely an economic one by colleges - they want the income from
students taking the credit hours instead of granting them ''free''
college credit.
</P>
<P>
   Accepting AP credit could mean a student would finish a degree
program in three or three-and-a-half years instead of four, thereby
''depriving a college of tuition dollars,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   AP tests are being graded the same way they have always been
graded, Jones said. The College Board believes a 5 score represents
a ''middle A'' under a college grading system, a 4 a ''middle B''
and a 3 a ''middle C.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It is possible that if a C at college is not what it used to
be, that that effects the AP's 3,'' Jones said. ''That is not a
problem with AP standards eroding. We match up our grading
standards to colleges, and I think that our process has help up
under scrutiny.''
</P>
<P>
   The State University of New York generally accepts 3s for
credit, though it varies with some campuses and some tests.
</P>
<P>
   While Lichten said New York students took the third-highest
number of AP tests per 100 high school graduates in the 1998-99
school year (62.4, behind Washington D.C.'s 83.7 and Utah's 63.5)
during the 1998-99 school year, New York was well back in the
middle of the pack when it came to how students did on the
examinations.
</P>
<P>
   Just over 64 percent got grades of 3 or higher, Lichten said and
35 percent scored 4s or better. Those were nearly identical to the
national averages but below the performances of students in most
other Northeastern states.

<HEADLINE> Programs cut, summer school expanded because of state tests  </HEADLINE>
By JENNIFER JORDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - In New Rochelle, a praised eighth-grade
medical mentoring program was pared down. A handful of Erie County
schools recessed recess. And some teachers have dropped the curtain
on drama.
</P>
<P>
   The common denominator? New state Board of Regents-imposed
standards on students.
</P>
<P>
   A number of teachers and administrators say increasing pressure
to prepare students for statewide tests has squeezed out innovation
and time for breaks and play, drawing more students into summer
school for both remedial lessons and so-called enrichment
activities.
</P>
<P>
   ''Some of the things we used to do will be set on the side
burner,'' said Robert Hebert, principal of Cattaraugus Elementary
School in western New York. ''If you go back, there were individual
performances at each grade level. It is time-consuming with
students rehearsing all those lines. Hopefully we will get back to
something along those lines, but it will take time.''
</P>
<P>
   Cattaraugus this year for the first time offered a camplike
summer school for children heading into grades two through four. It
combined reading help with fairy tale performances. Hebert said the
standards were part of the reason for the program.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're becoming more and more jammed in the year with things
they have to do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   New York is one of a number of states to place increasing
importance on statewide benchmarks. Fourth-grade students now face
English and math tests. Incoming 10th graders will have to pass
exams in English, math, global history and geography, U.S. history
and a science to graduate. The state's grading of schools depends
on how students perform, so tests are crucial to schools' public
images.
</P>
<P>
   ''The humanness of the students seemed brushed aside by the
pressure to raise the numbers,'' Sarah Carman, salutatorian of
Hudson Falls High School north of Albany, said in her commencement
speech earlier this year. ''It set up another wall separating us
from one another. Those who did well felt like geeks. Those who
didn't do well felt like idiots.''
</P>
<P>
   Alfie Kohn, a former teacher, author and critic of statewide
standards, has been working with teachers throughout the country
who oppose the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ''Teachers across New York state, especially the best teachers,
are finding it increasingly difficult to do the best kind of
instruction,'' said Kohn, who lives in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   He cited cutbacks in a mentoring program offered for the last
five years at Isaac E. Hayes Middle School. It put eighth graders
alongside physicians to interview patients and survey medical
literature.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, the state allowed mentored students to get
biology credit. When Regents standards changed, the mentoring no
longer counted for biology even though the Education Department
acknowledges its success and says it covered much the same ground.
</P>
<P>
   Education spokesman Tom Dunn called it an overreaction to
criticize higher standards for the loss of the mentoring program.
''It's a great course,'' Dunn said. ''Why don't you offer it to
kids ... in the next grade?''
</P>
<P>
   But schools have to draw the line somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At one of the Buffalo region's premiere school districts,
Williamsville, officials acknowledged last spring that they did not
comply with state regulations to provide daily exercise time
totaling 120 minutes a week. They said an already-packed schedule
and Regents efforts prevented it.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton-Fulton-Montgomery Board of Cooperative Education
Services' students in Johnstown are taking physical education
classes at technical schools because of schedule reshuffling due to
the new demands. Because BOCES centers lack fully-equipped gyms,
fitness walking or golf replaced volleyball matches.
</P>
<P>
   Summer school offers students the opportunity to make up some of
the fun activities. This year, 511 school districts and BOCES
centers offered summer classes, up from 406 in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the state budgeted $35 million specifically
for summertime Regents preparation. And many schools are offering
summer school to younger students since fourth grade is ground zero
for the testing regimen.
</P>
<P>
   ''Regents' standards created summer school for these kids,''
said Irene Rosenthal, a fifth-grade reading teacher at Sand Creek
Middle School, outside Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Although a Regents defender, Rosenthal admits six weeks of
summer school - with classes of about 15 students compared to 25
during the school year - allows time for more creative incentives.
Her students this summer produced a newspaper based on the
Revolutionary War. And when they left book reports in paper
Christmas stockings, the next morning they found treats in place of
successful reports.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Kelsey, 12, says he feels less afraid to ask questions
when there are fewer students in class and that he feels like he's
forgetting less by attending summer school.
</P>
<P>
   Not every student will get that opportunity, though, said David
Ernst, spokesman for the state School Boards Association.
</P>
<P>
   ''The state by no means covers all the costs of summer school,''
he said. So in poor or overloaded urban districts, that may not be
an option.
</P>
<P>
   Even without summer school, Kathy St. Laurent, a mother of four
in Minoa near Syracuse, is concerned about the amount of time
school takes from students' extracurricular lives.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'd like to see them be a kid longer,'' she said. ''If kids
have all this homework, yet coaches still say they have to be there
Monday through Friday for practices, that's a lot. Not to mention
spending time with family.''

<HEADLINE> GOPer: Tax Veto Can Be Overridden  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican congressman appealed to fellow
legislators Saturday for bipartisan cooperation to overturn
President Clinton's expected veto of legislation to eliminate the
inheritance tax.
</P>
<P>
   ''Democrats and Republicans alike know that the death tax is
unfair to family farmers and unfair to small businesspeople of
every kind,'' Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., said in the Republicans'
weekly radio address.
</P>
<P>
   The estate tax repeal will cost the government $104 billion over
10 years. Clinton has promised to veto the legislation, probably
next month.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has said the package of tax cuts the
Republican-controlled Congress passed this year would all but
consume the nation's projected budget surpluses outside the Social
Security Trust Fund, leaving nothing for ''other national
priorities.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey said farmers' surviving children are taxed unfairly
because of the worth of their land, and small business owners are
hurt trying to leave legacies to their children.
</P>
<P>
   He said the tax also hurts the high-tech economy.
</P>
<P>
   ''Many of these brilliant folks started out playing with ideas
in their garages, with few resources to invest,'' he said. ''Now
they've created something they can pass on to their children, so
they can live in greater comfort. The government shouldn't punish
success.''
</P>
<P>
   The Senate vote of 59-39 was well short of the two-thirds
majority needed to override a presidential veto, but Dickey said
''we intend'' to challenge a Clinton rejection of the bill. In the
House, 65 Democrats jumped ship to help Republicans win a 279-136
vote for repeal of the tax by 2010. It would take 290 votes in the
House to override a veto if all 435 members voted, or just over
half the 20 who did not vote this month.

<HEADLINE> Warning on Nigeria Credit Card Use  </HEADLINE>
By GREG MYRE
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- With a horde of American businessmen and
journalists here for President Clinton's weekend visit, U.S.
diplomats have issued an odd security warning: Don't use your
credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   In Nigeria, a country with a rich tradition of scams and
swindles, it's widely assumed that credit card numbers will be
passed on to thieves and fraudulent charges may begin appearing
long after the visitor has returned home. One journalist in the
region said it's happened to him twice following reporting trips to
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   From hotel clerks attempting to pad their meager salaries to
military dictators accused of plundering billions of dollars in oil
wealth, corruption has impoverished this potentially prosperous
land for decades.
</P>
<P>
   President Olusegun Obasanjo declared war on corruption after his
election last year and his government is trying to track the vast
sums of state oil money that vanished into foreign bank accounts
during the military dictatorship of Gen. Sani Abacha, who died in
1998.
</P>
<P>
   But restoring Nigeria's badly tarnished reputation and
retrieving the cash is a monumental task.
</P>
<P>
   International investors shy away from the country, having heard
too many tales of massive fraud. Nigerian involvement in
international drug smuggling, money laundering and embezzlement
schemes has made it difficult for Nigerians to obtain visas
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   And critics say Obasanjo's anti-corruption drive has not been
broad based, focusing mainly on people linked to his former rival,
Abacha.
</P>
<P>
   The president ''has just picked on a few of Abacha's cronies and
asked them to give back a portion of the money they stole,'' said
Gani Fawehinmi, an outspoken lawyer who has written extensively
about government malfeasance.
</P>
<P>
   ''The government still tolerates our culture of corruption,'' he
said. ''The average Nigerian has come to believe it's OK to rob a
bank as long as you agree to return some of the money if you're
caught.''
</P>
<P>
   International surveys routinely name Nigeria as the world's most
corrupt country. Last year, when Nigeria was edged out for the top
spot by Cameroon in one ranking, Nigerians boastfully joked that
they had bribed Cameroon to accept the dubious honor.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Obasanjo's government can point to several high-profile
victories:
</P>
<P>
   -- Senate President Chuba Okadigbo was voted out of office this
month after he admitted receiving a $220,000 Christmas bonus and
purchasing $370,000 worth of furniture for his official residence,
far more than allocated. He was the third senior politician ousted
for wrongdoing in the past year.
</P>
<P>
   -- Switzerland handed over $66 million in July from bank accounts
linked to Abacha. The Swiss, acting on requests from Nigeria, have
frozen $670 million in accounts held by the late general and his
associates. Luxembourg has frozen similar accounts worth $600
million.
</P>
<P>
   The Nigerian government claims that the senior Abacha, his
family and close friends plundered the Central Bank for as much as
$3 billion during his five years in power.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to explain why corruption is so pervasive, Nigerians offer
several theories.
</P>
<P>
   The huge oil industry has created a fantastically wealthy elite
and national get-rich-quick mentality. Politicians and businessmen
have stolen shamelessly and rarely been caught or punished.
Millions of Nigerians in acute poverty feel left out of the gold
rush, and have seen that wrongdoing seldom has repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians also have an entrepreneurial flair that sometimes runs
amok. As a result, petty corruption is part of everyday life. The
Nigerians even have their own word for a small bribe -- dash.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil-rich Niger Delta, siphoning crude from oil pipelines
is a national pastime despite the enormous risks. Oil vandals have
ignited several raging fires in recent months, claiming hundreds of
lives and prompting the government to establish a security force
authorized to shoot on sight. Undeterred, kidnappers seize oil
workers for ransom -- or in some cases for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Idriss Abubakar, opposition senator and anti-corruption
campaigner, said Nigeria's deep-rooted corruption problem has no
easy solution, and he questions whether the government is up to the
task.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any foreign investor bringing money to Nigeria
until he sees serious change,'' Abubakar said. ''So far, that
change is not visible.''

<HEADLINE> Former Bergen judge gets own TV show  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HACKENSACK, N.J. (AP) - He once complained, ''I can live on a
judicial salary. I'm just not sure I want to die on one.''
</P>
<P>
   Now former Superior Court Judge Andrew P. Napolitano won't have
to worry about his paycheck. Starting Monday, the judge who once
held court in Bergen County will star in his own television show,
''Power Of Attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many other court-based television shows, Napolitano's will
let ordinary people try their cases in front of millions on the
tube. But on this show, they'll get dream-team lawyers to argue
their cases for them.
</P>
<P>
   O.J. Simpson prosecutor Christopher Darden will represent a kid
who threw a rock at a BMW. Geoffrey Fieger, Jack Kevorkian's
lawyer, and Edward Masry, boss of the real-life Erin Brockovich,
will handle cases of wedding dresses ruined by seamstresses, and a
boy who says his father failed to give him the promised $25 for
every ''A'' on his report card. And F. Lee Bailey was involved in
the pilot episode.
</P>
<P>
   ''The lawyers are dramatic, dynamic,'' Napolitano told The
Record of Hackensack for Saturday's editions. ''They argue the
cases as if they were treason trials.''
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano knows the competition for viewers is cutthroat.
</P>
<P>
   ''I tell people they'd better get my autograph now because, by
Halloween, I might be history,'' he said. ''I'm not quitting my day
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Napolitano served at the Hackensack courthouse for eight years
beginning in 1987. Attorney Brian Neary, who faced Judge Napolitano
in Hackensack, believes the Napolitano's show will succeed.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was a top trial judge,'' Neary said. ''He was very
hardworking and bright. He cared.''
</P>
<P>
   His show debuts Monday on Fox Channel 5 with two back-to-back
episodes at 9 and 9:30 a.m. Around the country, 208 stations --
covering 98.5 percent of the nation -- will carry ''Power of
Attorney.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, the Princeton and Notre Dame graduate became, at 36,
the youngest state judge ever appointed in New Jersey. He later
became the youngest to earn lifetime tenure.
</P>
<P>
   He wanted to become a federal judge, but his nomination went
nowhere, and in 1995, he called a news conference to announce that
he was leaving. He complained about the pay and the lawyers who
showed up in court unprepared and sounding as if they got their
degrees from ''Fred's Barber College and Legal School.'' His
complaint about judicial salaries got so much attention that the
state's judges were awarded a raise just six months later.
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the bench, Napolitano joined several law firms
before landing at Sills Cummis Radin Tischman Epstein &AMP; Gross in
Newark, where he handles cases involving corporate trade secrets
and disputes.
</P>
<P>
   He also became a legal analyst for several television stations
and has been a weekly commentator on the Fox News Channel since
1998. It was while on a Fox show that he was spotted by a
television producer in Los Angeles.

<HEADLINE> Number of birds infected with West Nile virus doubles  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The number of dead birds found to be
infected with the West Nile virus in New Jersey has doubled in the
past week to 322, according to state officials.
</P>
<P>
   Marilyn Riley, a spokeswoman for the state Department of Health
and Senior Services, said that the increase should not be cause for
concern.
</P>
<P>
   ''The birds are the most sensitive indicator of the virus
spreading, but there's definitely no reason to panic,'' she told
The Philadelphia Inquirer for Saturday's editions. ''We'll have to
see what happens in the next few weeks. What we've seen in other
counties is that it starts with a few birds, then snowballs after a
while.''
</P>
<P>
   Included among the 165 infected birds found last week is a crow
discovered on the campus of Princeton University - the first bird
found with the disease in Mercer County.
</P>
<P>
   Testing has continued across the Delaware River in Bucks County,
Pa., but officials there say so far no infected birds have been
found.
</P>
<P>
   Sharon Southard, a spokeswoman for the state Department of
Environmental Protection, attributed the rise in West Nile cases to
the success of county surveillance programs and heavy rains at the
peak of the mosquito season.
</P>
<P>
   There have been no confirmed cases of humans infected with the
virus in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Humans can contract West Nile, which killed seven people in New
York last summer, only by being bitten by a mosquito that has fed
on an infected bird.

<HEADLINE> Learning dignity and civility, plus grammar and long division  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLYN THOMPSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) - Susan Nadler has been teaching long enough
to remember the ''good citizenship'' lessons of the 1960s - and how
they got thrown out the window in the '70s.
</P>
<P>
   ''We had workshops on how to keep values out of the classroom,''
the Schenectady middle school teacher recalls of those latter
freewheeling days. ''You could not impart your values on anybody or
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Wait long enough and anything will come back in style.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Nadler and teachers across New York are under state
orders to teach things like tolerance, honesty, dignity and respect
for others to students at every grade level.
</P>
<P>
   Proponents say successful values education could lessen the
chances of Columbine-like violence in New York schools.
</P>
<P>
   By including the mandate for civility, citizenship and character
instruction in a broad school safety law signed by Gov. George
Pataki in July, New York joined the majority of states requiring
character education in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a quality of sadness about it in that, have we got to
a point where we have to mandate or legislate the teaching of what
we used to take for granted: civility and character,'' said Tony
McCann, a high school English teacher in the Shenendehowa Central
Schools in suburban Albany who, like his peers, has begun thinking
about how to meet the new goals.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think we always recognized those things have to be taught,''
he said. ''I think the assumption in the past was those things
would be taught at home and reinforced at school.''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, after being horrified by school shootings in
Littleton, Colo.; Springfield, Ore.; Fayetteville, Tenn.;
Jonesboro, Ark., and Edinboro, Pa. - to name a partial list,
administrators are taking no chances.
</P>
<P>
   Tough gun laws are already on the books; they have not stopped
the violence. Educators hope to reach children before they even
think about picking up a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ''You start with this theory that, from the time the student
gets on the bus, we have consistent rules on what's expected,''
said Dennis Tracey, a high school teacher in the North Rockland
Central School District in Rockland County. ''If a student brings a
weapon to school, it's zero tolerance. If we have consistent
expectations in behavior all the way through, I think we'll have a
much better way of making this work.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Mary Donohue recommended New York adopt the civility
and character component after chairing a school safety task force
last year. It is one of 15 components in the Project SAVE (Safe
Schools Against Violence in Education) legislation, which also
gives teachers more authority to remove disruptive students from
the classroom and makes classroom assaults felonies.
</P>
<P>
   ''I taught from the late '60s to the '70s and as I traveled the
state chairing the task force, I noticed a distinctly different
atmosphere in the public schools,'' Donohue said. ''There was much
less emphasis on civility, on interaction, respect for individual
differences.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York State United Teachers documented the changes in a
1993 report, ''Conflict in the Classroom,'' which foresaw the
violence of recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ''New York state's classrooms are no longer immune to the
conflicts of the outside world,'' began the report, which cited the
need for enforceable behavior codes amid teachers' fears over
deteriorating student conduct.
</P>
<P>
   While the civility requirement amounts to another mandate at a
time when new performance standards have teachers under increasing
pressure, Donahue said it has been well-received across
philosophical and political lines.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly how the values will be taught will be left to individual
districts, which will interweave them in the existing curriculum,
Donahue said, rather than ''as a separate civility 101.''
</P>
<P>
   Many New York districts already have successful programs in
place. Schenectady's ''Character Counts,'' for example, emphasizes
values of honesty and respect in the high school, while the North
Rockland district teaches the ''Three Rs,'' standing for rights,
responsibility and respect.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the end of the day, the practical effect is to ask
localities to avail themselves of the curriculum materials that are
already there,'' Regents Chancellor Carl Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Nadler, who teaches at Oneida Middle School, said a large part
of values education involves teaching by example.
</P>
<P>
   ''If you expect them to do homework, you should have the papers
corrected the next day,'' the 32-year veteran of classrooms said.
''It's how you treat them. Let them know how, in turn, they are to
treat you and how they should treat others.''
</P>
<P>
   Donahue said civics lessons can also be infused into discussions
of historical figures.
</P>
<P>
   ''We emphasize to our children what made them the individual
they were, not just the ostensible achievement they attained in
public and community service,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   There is agreement that it was not a sudden collapse in society
that led to the need for this mandate, rather a societal evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kids are bombarded with so much stuff between the computers
and television, the songs they listen to, and there is a different
atmosphere out there,'' Nadler said. ''What I see is kids are more
worldly.''
</P>
<P>
   McCann spoke of a need for schools to be ''an island of culture
or respect and civility, even in a sea of chaos and rudeness.''
</P>
<P>
   ''But there is a tremendous question behind the whole thing,''
he added. ''Can the schools reverse what is happening in the
general culture or do they inevitably reflect to some degree what
is happening in the general culture?
</P>
<P>
   ''If kids are watching 'Jerry Springer' on mainstream television
or 'South Park' with its rudeness and crudeness, and they're
listening on the radio to shock jocks on a daily basis and we come
along and try to say to them, 'This is all wrong,' the school then
becomes a countercultural institution,'' he said, ''which we may
very well have to be.''

<HEADLINE> Big stuff, big kids -- the struggle to fit it into classrooms  </HEADLINE>
By LYNN BREZOSKY
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLTON, N.Y. (AP) - Wall space spent, poems ''about me'' spill
out of a fifth-grade classroom and onto the hallways of Charlton
Heights Elementary School. There they bump up against the rolls of
construction paper that didn't fit into the storeroom.
</P>
<P>
   The faculty bathroom had some space, but it was taken by boxes
of computer paper, stacked against walls and under sinks.
</P>
<P>
   In a school built in 1958, Year 2000 learning just doesn't seem
to fit.
</P>
<P>
   ''Overall enrollment has not grown,'' said Christy Multer,
spokeswoman for the Burnt Hills-Ballston Lake school district. ''We
need more space because there are more things in the classroom.''
</P>
<P>
   Today's classroom is hands-on and high tech. That can mean
teepees, area rugs, story couches and math mommies sharing space
with computer stations and corner science labs. Inclusion has added
wheelchairs, computerized voice boards, oxygen tanks and individual
teaching aides.
</P>
<P>
   Books tend to be bigger, and so are book bags. Gone are the days
of five rows of desks and a front-and-center teacher's desk. Now,
desks are more likely grouped into topically based learning
stations with the teacher's desk shoved in a corner to double as
shelf space.
</P>
<P>
   Take Anne Long's kindergarten class. Twenty-five years ago,
Long's ''stuff'' was limited to dittos and workbooks. Now she has
counting games and big (18-by-24-inch) books that allow pupils to
track the printed words during story times. Children are broken
into groups to pursue different activities - such as learning on
the computer, and that takes space.
</P>
<P>
   ''Kindergarten is a microcosm of life, and these days life is
busy,'' Long said. There are even mock dishes in the mock kitchen
sink.
</P>
<P>
   Or Carol Douglas' fifth-grade room. The morning announcements
come into the classroom as an internal news show, presented on a
large TV that juts from the wall like a basketball hoop.
</P>
<P>
   There's a large abacus next to a large calculator, and a
''dramatic play area'' that's been a kitchen, a castle, a
restaurant and a hospital. The walls are covered with art projects.
</P>
<P>
   During the last 30 years, New York state has continued to revise
its minimum class size requirements from 550 square feet to 660
square feet to today's 770 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   ''Even houses and bedrooms are bigger - there's not anything
unique to schools,'' said Robert Rogers of the state Education
Department.
</P>
<P>
   But teachers say even bigger is still too small.
</P>
<P>
   ''You take two teachers and 22 children and put a nurse in there
with that bottle of oxygen and it gets very crowded,'' Long said.
</P>
<P>
   The average U.S. school is 42 years old, built during the
post-World War II years when births peaked at 4 million annually.
</P>
<P>
   Today, in the midst of the baby ''boomlet,'' a record 52 million
children are attending 88,223 schools. To accommodate this, the
nation is in the midst of a schools construction splurge that could
top $42 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The problem, Joe Agron of American School &AMP; University Magazine
in Overland Park, Kan., said, is that average per-pupil space
allotment is in many cases getting more generous but classroom
space itself is staying the same.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one's really focusing on the classroom, which is probably a
mistake since the classroom is where most of the learning is going
on,'' Agron said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the International Council of Educational Facility
Planners in Scottsdale, Ariz., the modern classroom's biggest space
hog is the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ''For every computer you add to the elementary classroom, you
displace 1.5 students,'' said Debbie Moore, the council's director
of operations.
</P>
<P>
   And those students themselves are getting bigger. A growth trend
in children - taller, definitely wider - makes classroom furniture
seem Lilliputian.
</P>
<P>
   Passing a fifth-grade classroom, teacher Carol DiLallo pointed
out pupils who seemed to spill over their desks. ''When they stand
up, I think there's another adult in the room,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   It's not universal, but American children as a whole are bigger
than they were in the days of the old Green's Corners School, a
19th-century one-room schoolhouse a few miles away from Charlton in
southern Saratoga County.
</P>
<P>
   Height researcher Richard Steckel has spent decades exploring
links between height and social environment, and says a strained
family environment or poor diet may prevent a child from reaching
optimum height. And the growth rate of the latest generation of
American children lags behind most Europeans, particularly the
Dutch. But as a whole, the population is continuing to get bigger,
he says, and where kids are tall, they may be heads taller than
their parents or grandparents were.
</P>
<P>
   ''Certainly fatness exceeds linear growth,'' said Leslie
Lieberman, a professor of anthropology and pediatrics at the
University of Florida at Gainesville.
</P>
<P>
   Green's Corners makes this evident. Once the school fit 35
children and a potbellied stove within its 480 square feet.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Karis, the historian who maintains the old school, opens
it to tours for one month out of the year. A typical school group
numbers 18 to 28. ''I have to take them through in shifts,'' she
said.

   An elementary school built for 300 pupils:

   Need for small class sizes, additional new program demands and

significantly increasing its size to accommodate similar number of

square feet compared to 62 square feet in 1970. Still, educators
say there's not enough space, that schools are being asked to house

<HEADLINE> Arbitration panel gives some union workers King holiday off  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   WALLINGFORD, Conn. (AP) - A state arbitration panel says at
least some town workers should receive Martin Luther King Jr. Day
as a paid holiday next year.
</P>
<P>
   The panel on Friday awarded the paid holiday to 55 supervisors
who are members of the Connecticut Independent Labor Union.
</P>
<P>
   But their decision is not binding. The Wallingford Town Council
could still reject it, in which case the decision would be
forwarded to another arbitration panel, whose decision would be
final.
</P>
<P>
   Two other arbitration panels are still conducting hearings on
whether to give the holiday to other town workers.
</P>
<P>
   Wallingford is the only Connecticut municipality that does not
close its offices in honor of the January holiday.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor William Dickinson Jr. has said he wants the town's six
unions to give up one of their existing 12 annual holidays to make
room for the King holiday.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy has led to allegations of racism and national
publicity, including a visit to town by the Rev. Jesse Jackson in
April. But Dickinson has held steadfastly to the position that the
issue is solely a labor problem.
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature last year passed a law designed to force
Wallingford to settle the dispute.
</P>
<P>
   The law called for mediation, followed by arbitration if the
mediation failed to resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
   In the town's last offer to the union, it proposed swapping
Lincoln's birthday with King Day, so workers could have King Day
off, and it proposed giving each worker an additional $50 per year.
</P>
<P>
   While awarding the holiday to workers, the panel also noted that
the town had negotiated in good faith.
</P>
<P>
   ''The record shows that the town and Mayor Dickinson long have
stood willing to provide MLK Day as a paid holiday,'' the
arbitration panel concluded. ''...the town (specifically Mayor
William Dickinson) has been inaccurately and unfairly pilloried by
public critics who have accused the town of harboring a peculiar
objection to MLK Day as a holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickinson called the arbitration ruling ''wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ''Each of us wanted the same thing. So what has the town
received in return for a new day being granted? Nothing. It's a
gratuitous gift of a new day,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   A dissenting arbitration panel member, William F. Smith Jr.,
criticized the union for not fairly compensating the town and for
being interested not so much in honoring King, as in gaining
another day off.

<HEADLINE> Man killed in gas explosion told to clean up rubble  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - One day after a Brooklyn couple died in a gas
explosion at their home, city officials fired off a letter to the
dead husband insisting that he was responsible for immediately
cleaning up the rubble.
</P>
<P>
   The city Buildings Department apologized Friday for the mix-up,
but a city councilman was still outraged by the letter sent to
Leonard Walit, 72, who perished with his 66-year-old wife Harriet
in the July 11 blast.
</P>
<P>
   The form letter, sent out as standard procedure and signed by
borough building commissioner Tarek Zeid, was addressed to Walit
and instructed the dead man that his home at 420 State St. ''must
be repaired or demolished immediately.''
</P>
<P>
   The bodies of the Walits and a third victim were trapped for
hours beneath their shattered four-story brownstone.
</P>
<P>
   ''The responsibility to take such action is yours, and because
of the severity of the condition, the work must begin
immediately,'' the letter continued. ''If you fail to do so, the
city will perform the necessary work and seek to recover it's (sic)
expenses from you.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Ken Fisher, D-Brooklyn, was appalled by the
letter's callousness.
</P>
<P>
   ''How could you not know that Mr. Walit had perished in the
explosion?'' he asked. ''This was not a normal circumstance and
certainly deserved a response that reflected the tragedy
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Wein, a spokesman for the Buildings Department, apologized
for the error and offered his condolences to the Walits' relatives.
</P>
<P>
   ''They have suffered a great deal and we sympathize with them
during their time of loss,'' Wein said. ''Our actions were never
meant to add to their grief, and we are very sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   The building owned by the Walits and an adjoining brownstone
were reduced to rubble by the explosion, which was attributed to a
leaky gas pipe.

<HEADLINE> Operator of Cape May-Lewes Ferry agrees to stop serving food  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   LOWER TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - The operator of the Cape May-Lewes
Ferry agreed to stop serving prepared food this week after four of
the fleet's five ships failed a third round of health inspections.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked the
Delaware River and Bay Authority to stop food service last week,
saying in a letter that ''conditions under which food is stored,
handled, prepared and served remain unsanitary.''
</P>
<P>
   The FDA said the unsanitary conditions could pose a threat to
the health of passengers, a claim the authority denied. Federal
officials had threatened to get a court order to block food service
if the authority did not agree to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ''You can't fight City Hall,'' DRBA spokesman James Salmon told
The Press of Atlantic City for Saturday's editions. ''You fight it,
and you look bad in the press. You don't fight it, and you still
look bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said the authority asked the FDA to give it until Tuesday
to shut down food operations. Most of the 162 full-time
food-service employees will be transferred to the terminals until
the ships are allowed to resume the service - a process that could
take at least three weeks, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Salmon said the authority will continue to sell prepackaged food
and plans to hire a full-time director of food protection, whose
job will be to ensure that the ferries are following correct
procedures for food service.

<HEADLINE> Education Sec. Takes School Tour  </HEADLINE>
By ANJETTA McQUEEN
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- Shedding light on the plight and promise of
America's small-town schools, Education Secretary Richard Riley is
taking his annual ''big yellow bus'' tour to the banks of the
Mississippi River.
</P>
<P>
   As self-described ''city boy'' from Greenville, S.C., Riley says
he wants to focus on oft-overlooked rural education issues. But the
nation's top education policy-maker was to embark Sunday on a trip
that promises to goad the GOP-led Congress into passing the Clinton
administration's nationwide school-construction and teacher-hiring
proposals.
</P>
<P>
   ''These are the things that make a difference,'' Riley said in
an interview on Friday. ''They will eventually pass. If this
Congress is that shortsighted and does not make some of these good
surpluses we have, we will have missed a most important
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Riley, the longest-serving education secretary, will visit
schools in Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee in the
weeklong trip. Riley, also one of the longest-serving members of
Clinton cabinet, started the tours as an annual vehicle to
highlight national priorities and bring his message closer to
parents, teachers and children.
</P>
<P>
   He rides in a charter bus painted to look like a school bus.
Members of Congress, governors and mayors often hop on and off to
greet him when he arrives in their jurisdictions.
</P>
<P>
   Riley insisted this year's trip -- in the midst of a presidential
election year with both major candidates seizing the education
issue for votes -- is not a get-out-the vote effort for Vice
President Al Gore, the Democrat's nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is about citizenship, not partisanship,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Recently released figures show improvements in student
performance in math, and boosts among minority high-schoolers in
reading and minority middle-schoolers in science. But
overwhelmingly, by most federal and state measures, the nation's
poor children -- most of them black or Hispanic -- lag behind their
more affluent peers.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said that's what's bringing him to the Delta this week:
''Twenty-five percent of American students go to rural or
small-town schools. Schools are always at the center of building up
a community; that is especially true in the rural areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, Riley will release a report detailing what's
needed to improve rural education. The report focuses on schools in
10 states in the Deep South, Appalachia and the Great Plains. These
schools, he said, suffer from declining enrollments, the lowest of
teacher salaries, crumbling buildings, pervasive poverty of
students, and poor housing stock that draws limited property tax
money for supplies and other needs.

<HEADLINE> Final Moments of a Doomed Submarine  </HEADLINE>
By BARRY RENFREW
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- With an honor guard in crisp blue uniforms
standing at attention on the deck and its flags snapping in the
breeze, the nuclear submarine Kursk glided silently out to sea, a
symbol of Russian power and pride.
</P>
<P>
   It was the last time anyone on land would see the
nuclear-powered warship that the Russian navy boasted was
unsinkable. As it headed into the Barents Sea for maneuvers, the
Kursk's crew expected to be home in a few days.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was named after the region in southern Russia where
Soviet troops in 1943 turned the tide against Nazi Germany's army
in the biggest tank battle in history. Like the old land battle,
the Kursk was intended to turn the tide at sea if there was ever
another world war.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was a 500-foot-long underwater missile base. Its
sides bristled with 24 silos, each housing a cruise missile capable
of slamming a nuclear warhead at supersonic speed into a target
hundreds of miles away. The submarine and a dozen like it were
designed during the Cold War to destroy the U.S. Navy's aircraft
carriers with swarms of missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Cold War ended a decade ago and the Kursk's nuclear warheads
were locked up ashore. The Soviet Union had disappeared and Russia
was falling apart, sinking deeper into poverty and backwardness.
</P>
<P>
   With most of its warships too dilapidated to put to sea, the
navy staked what little money it had on keeping up the nuclear
submarine fleet -- a potent threat that the navies of the United
States and other Western nations could not ignore.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was just five years old. The crew, nearly half of them
officers with advanced technical skills, had been hailed as the
navy's elite, a chosen few who could handle any challenge.
</P>
<P>
   President Vladimir Putin had big plans for the navy and the
Kursk. The navy exercises that the Kursk sailed to join on Aug. 10
were a prelude for a major step in putting Moscow back on the world
stage: the return of a Russian fleet to the Mediterranean in 2001
for the first time in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   The exercises were big news. Russian television showed film of
the Northern Fleet in action, the hulking cruisers and nimble
destroyers cutting through the waves and warships firing missiles.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Aug. 14, a Monday, the navy announced that the Kursk had
experienced a malfunction. The situation was not critical -- the
submarine was in radio contact, air and power lines had been hooked
up and arrangements were being made to bring the crew up, the navy
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mounting evidence suggests the crewmen were already dead and
almost every utterance by top officials about saving the Kursk
would turn out to be untrue.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was rising to the surface, possibly preparing to fire
a torpedo on Aug. 12 when disaster struck. Nothing is known about
what the crew was doing in those last few moments.
</P>
<P>
   Norwegian monitors later reported detecting an explosion in the
vicinity of the Kursk, followed within minutes by a much larger
blast that registered at 3.5 on seismic monitors, equivalent to a
small earthquake. All the signs suggest a problem in the torpedo
compartment at the front of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   The submarine was carrying a new type of torpedo with a liquid
fuel system that some officers complained was unstable, according
to some reports. Or the young, inexperienced conscript sailors may
have fumbled one of the torpedoes or the test firing may have gone
wrong, the weapon jamming in a torpedo tube.
</P>
<P>
   The first blast must have convulsed the Kursk, knocking out
control systems and pitching it into a sharp dive toward the bottom
350 feet below the waves.
</P>
<P>
   Crewmen would have been knocked sprawling as the submarine
plunged out of control. Officers in the command center would have
been shouting for reports, trying to determine what had happened.
Maybe there was time to hit the alarm system, but the whole crew
already knew they were in serious trouble.
</P>
<P>
   The first blast probably killed and injured some of the sailors.
Survivors would have been shouting for help, for first aid crews,
frantically trying to reach injured comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Plunging down at mounting speed and with the decks slanting
sharply forward, sailors would have been fighting to stay on their
feet or in their seats as the Kursk plunged into the depths. They
never regained control.
</P>
<P>
   A second, catastrophic explosion ripped through the Kursk,
probably as it slammed into the bottom. This blast was probably
torpedoes and anti-submarine missiles detonating. Russia's navy
says it was about 2 tons of explosives going up; some officers say
it could have been more than 10 tons.
</P>
<P>
   The hull was twisted like a wet towel being squeezed dry.
</P>
<P>
   The Kursk was built of immensely strong steel to withstand the
enormous pressures of diving hundreds of feet. The hull would have
contained and intensified the explosion. Following the path of
least resistance, the blast ripped backward, breaking through the
thinner walls of the crew compartments.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crew were within yards of the blast. Navy officers
say that many were probably vaporized by the detonation; others
were ripped to bits.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody still alive after the second explosion was almost
certainly stunned, probably deafened and unconscious. Kursk's
nuclear reactors appear to have shut down, plunging the submarine
into darkness.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions ripped at least one large hole in the hull. Tons
of water surged in, quickly filling the submarine. Anyone who
survived the explosions almost certainly drowned, the navy says.
</P>
<P>
   There may never be an exact reconstruction of the last moments
of the Kursk. It did not have black boxes like those which can tell
what happened to a crashed airliner. Raising the Kursk may be
impossible, meaning that its secrets will be lost forever.

<HEADLINE> Probe widens to include deputies  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NORWICH, Conn. (AP) - A state investigation into the county
sheriff system has expanded to include the financial and business
records of 50 deputy sheriffs across the state, according to a
published report.
</P>
<P>
   The probe by the attorney general's office had reportedly been
focused on the actions of the state's eight high sheriffs,
investigating possible violations of tax and gun laws. But Attorney
General Richard Blumenthal has issued new subpoenas that focus on
allegations that deputies misappropriated money from garnished
wages they were charged with collecting, the Norwich Bulletin
reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It is being alleged that some deputies have deposited money in
their own interest-bearing accounts for a period of time before
turning the funds over to creditors. The deputies would then keep
the interest earned on those funds, the paper reported.
</P>
<P>
   The subpoenas are seeking all records pertaining to wage
executions and bank statements.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations are similar to those facing Windham High Sheriff
Thomas White.
</P>
<P>
   White faces embezzlement charges in connection with a check he
says he inadvertently deposited to a personal account rather than a
business account while serving as a deputy. The check was for
between $1,000 and $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   White, 38, has said he repaid that money with interest. He has
explained the deposit as a mistake he made because he was never
properly trained as a deputy sheriff when he was appointed in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Several deputies have challenged the subpoenas issued by
Blumenthal, as did four high sheriffs who were subpoenaed earlier
this year. A hearing is scheduled for Thursday in Middletown
Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The expanded investigation comes as the high sheriffs are
gearing up for their campaign to defeat the proposed constitutional
amendment at the Nov. 7 election that would eliminate the office of
high sheriff. Should the amendment be approved, the deputies would
be placed under the oversight of the state's Judicial Branch.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Drug Tested in Dominican Rep.  </HEADLINE>
By SUSANNAH A. NESMITH
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) -- American researchers
testing a new AIDS drug needed patients who had never received any
treatment. The Dominican Republic has them -- by the thousands.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems like a win-win,'' said Joy Schmitt, spokeswoman for
Agouron Pharmaceuticals of La Jolla, Calif. People ''are getting
treatment ... and we're getting the patients we need for the
trial.''
</P>
<P>
   Agouron is using Dominicans to test its capravirine because it
can be hard in the United States and Europe to find patients who
haven't received any other treatments, between health insurance and
public health systems.
</P>
<P>
   Finding such people here was easy: More than 2 percent of the
country's 8 million people are infected with the AIDS virus -- and
few can afford medicines that cost many times the average income.
</P>
<P>
   ''No one helps you here if you have this disease,'' said Fe
Maria, who lived 13 years carrying the AIDS virus without hope of
getting treatment before going on the trial.
</P>
<P>
   Capravirine, which researchers hope will help fight off
mutations of the virus, has already been through the safety phase
of testing. In the current and critical phase, 90 Dominicans and

<HEADLINE> US Said To Dismantle Drug Operation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials said Saturday that they have
broken up a major drug trafficking operation that used commercial
ships to haul Colombian cocaine around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Customs Service said 43 people have been arrested and
almost 25 tons of cocaine confiscated during the two-year
investigation, dubbed ''Operation Journey.'' Officials believe the
organization transported at least 68 tons of cocaine to 12 nations
over three years.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the operation was announced in recent days by
Venezuelan officials, who said they seized 10 tons of cocaine and
arrested 16 people in a series of raids.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in custody is the suspected leader of the
organization, Ivan de la Vega, a Colombian citizen arrested Aug. 16
in Venezuela. He has been turned over to U.S. custody and faces
charges in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began as separate investigations by the Drug
Enforcement Administration office in Athens, Greece, the Customs
office in Houston and other agencies. The investigations were
eventually united and coordinated by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Customs described the organization as ''a
one-stop shipping service for Colombian cartels interested in
moving cocaine via maritime vessels to U.S. and European markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization used eight to 10 freighters. Some were owned by
the organization; others by shipping companies in Greece and other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine would be transported by land or air from Colombia to the
Orinoco River Delta in northeastern Venezuela. It would be hidden
in the jungle before being taken by boats to offshore freighters.
It would then be stored in secret compartments until it reached its
destination, where boats carried it ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The organization would try to throw off investigators by making
''dry runs'' with legitimate cargo. But working with foreign police
agencies, the DEA and Customs obtained information about specific
cocaine shipments heading to Europe, Customs said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case demonstrates what can be achieved when nations of
the world work together against a common enemy,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> Burundi Peace Deal Deadline Looms  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS TOMLINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARUSHA, Tanzania (AP) -- Nelson Mandela met with negotiators
representing 19 Burundian political groups Saturday, as they raced
to meet a Monday deadline for reaching at least a partial peace
accord to end seven years of civil war in their central African
country.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton and the leaders of 12 African countries are
expected to attend a signing ceremony in this northern Tanzanian
town Monday, but two key issues have so far stalled the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Diplomats close to the peace process said negotiators from
Burundian President Pierre Buyoya's government met with the leaders
of the main Hutu political party from Friday afternoon to early
Saturday morning, trying to iron out the final sticking points.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Burundi's Hutu majority and Tutsi minority have been
fighting a civil war since 1993, when Tutsi paratroopers
assassinated the country's first democratically elected president,
a Hutu.
</P>
<P>
   More than 200,000 people have died in the war, most of them
civilians. Tutsis have dominated the government and the army since
independence in 1962.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela, the former South African president who has been
mediating the peace talks since December, delivered a new draft
agreement to all the parties Friday and was confident it would be
signed Monday, mediators said.
</P>
<P>
   ''I don't see any problems at all. I think we are going to
sign,'' Mandela told reporters on his arrival at Arusha.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement calls for power sharing in the government, army
and parliament and contains provisions for the reconstruction of
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats close to the talks said that a cease-fire with
armed Hutu rebels -- who have not attended the talks -- and the issue
of who will lead a transitional government remain deal-breakers.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of nervousness remains around the cease-fire,'' said one
Western diplomat, who asked not to be named. ''They may put off a
full agreement until later because the rebels are not here.''
</P>
<P>
   Buyoya has refused to sign a deal without a cease-fire in place.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela met earlier this week with at least one of the leaders
from among the three rebel groups, but he has not commented on the
outcome of those talks.
</P>
<P>
   Another rebel leader, Leonce Nyangoma of the National Council
for the Defense of Democracy, issued a statement supporting the
peace process and nominating a candidate to serve as the leader of
a three-year transitional government, despite having boycotted the
talks.
</P>
<P>
   Who will lead the transitional government remained a major
sticking point Saturday, but some progress appeared to be taking
place, with the 10 Tutsi political parties and the seven Hutu
parties discussing candidates for the post. The government and the
army, which make up the other negotiating groups, each support
Buyoya.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has gotten to the point where each individual leader must
decide what they can agree to and still survive politically,'' said
another diplomat, also speaking on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the chief mediator for the portion of the agreement
setting out a strategy for reconstructing the war-ravaged country
said his committee had finished work with universal agreement. But
international donors will now keep a close eye on the more
complicated aspects of the peace process before making any
financial commitments, said Georg Lennkh, an Austrian diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   ''The donors will be meeting in Brussels on Sept. 15. They will
be looking at what is happening on the political scene,'' Lennkh
said.

<HEADLINE> RETRANSMITTING to add photo number  </HEADLINE>
By WAYNE PARRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   SOUTH ORANGE, N.J. (AP) - When Alyssa Merla heads back to Seton
Hall to begin her sophomore year, she'll have the usual
back-to-school things on her mind: Will I like my dorm? How much
will textbooks cost? Which classes will be the toughest?
</P>
<P>
   But she'll have something else on her mind as well: the memory
of flames illuminating the dark hallway of her dorm; choking smoke
pouring into her room; waiting what seemed like an eternity for
rescuers to arrive; and deciding she and a friend had to brave the
smoke and run to safety or die in their room.
</P>
<P>
   Merla was one of hundreds of freshmen roused from sleep on the
morning of Jan. 19 when a fire broke out on the third floor of
Boland Hall, Seton Hall's on-campus housing for first-year
students. Three students were killed, and 62 others were injured.
</P>
<P>
   With a new school year set to begin this week at the state's
only Roman Catholic University, the cause of the blaze remains
undetermined, and rumors that as many as three students may have
started it continue to circulate. The Essex County Prosecutor's
Office will only say the fire remains under investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But The Star-Ledger of Newark, citing unnamed sources, has
reported that investigators are focused on three Seton Hall
students who they believe either set the fire or know about it. The
newspaper reported that one of the students admitted vandalizing
the lounge where the fire originated, but not to setting the blaze.
The investigation stalled when the suspects stopped talking to
police, sources told the paper.
</P>
<P>
   That led police to stage a raid on a Newark bar popular with
Seton Hall students a month after the blaze, allegedly to crack
down on underage drinking. But lawyers for some of the 20 students
arrested said authorities issued subpoenas to a half-dozen students
wanted for questioning about the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The uncertainty and the lack of closure to a traumatic event
still weigh heavily on the minds of students who survived the
blaze. They may wonder: Is that guy next to me in literature class
a killer?
</P>
<P>
   ''That aspect of it can be scary, not knowing what caused it, if
it was one of my fellow students,'' said Nick Donato of Sparta, who
broke his wrist and ankle jumping from the third floor to escape
the flames. He still has to go for regular physical therapy. He has
sudden flashes of pain and walks with a slight limp.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he and others who survived the blaze are looking forward to
the new semester and have a generally upbeat attitude about their
sophomore year. They cite $4.5 million worth of sprinklers Seton
Hall installed in its dorms, a new awareness of fire safety, and
the support of others who've gone through what they experienced.
Freshmen move in on Thursday; classes begin on Sept. 6.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm very optimistic about school,'' said Merla, of West Long
Branch. ''The sprinklers are in, and I've got wonderful friends
that support me. There's no real fear of going back in anyone's
mind, but we're definitely all thinking of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Merla said not knowing what caused the fire is hard for Seton
Hall students.
</P>
<P>
   ''We basically don't know anything,'' she said. ''But I'm not
going to go into class thinking, 'He could have done it, or she
could have done it.' We're all trying to have a good feeling about
going back to school.''
</P>
<P>
   The fire broke out in a third-floor lounge before dawn, filling
the floor with smoke and sending hundreds of terrified freshmen
staggering into the cold outside.
</P>
<P>
   Inside, firefighters found the bodies of Frank Caltabilota of
West Long Branch, John Giunta of Vineland and Aaron Karol of Green
Brook. All were 18 years old.
</P>
<P>
   Merla said she waited in her room for a half hour for someone to
come rescue her.
</P>
<P>
   ''I thought I was going to die,'' she said. ''Somehow, I made it
out of there. I went through my suitemate's room, and we made a run
for it. I opened up the door, and I saw flames, and smoke was
spilling in like crazy, so I closed the door.
</P>
<P>
   ''They were yelling up from the ground to put towels under the
door, that there were firemen on the floor coming to get us, but
nobody was,'' she said. ''We were all terrified. We didn't know
what to do. We figured if we stayed there, we were going to die, so
we ran out into the hall and made a run for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato came to the same conclusion and decided to jump for his
life.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was either that, or not make it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet all the students injured in the blaze who are medically able
to return to class will do so this fall, university spokeswoman
Shannon Allen said. None of those hurt in the blaze decided against
returning to Seton Hall, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The blaze cast a harsh spotlight on Seton Hall's fire safety
preparations. The university acknowledged that for years it didn't
hold organized fire drills as required by state codes, because it
believed that false alarms that resulted in evacuations counted as
the same thing. State investigators subsequently found hundreds of
fire safety violations at the campus, which Seton Hall says have
all been addressed.
</P>
<P>
   Thirteen students, including the families of two of the dead
students, have filed notices indicating their intent to sue the
school over the fire, and seven plan to sue South Orange or other
governmental entities.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law requiring the
installation of automatic sprinkler systems in the state's private
and public school dormitories.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Seton Hall will have smoke detectors in each room,
plans at least one fire drill per semester, and will have floor
meetings in every dorm to review fire safety plans.
</P>
<P>
   And fire safety is now firmly ingrained in the consciousness of
many Seton Hall students. Merla asked to be assigned to a dorm room
no higher than the second floor; Donato will be on the ground floor
and already has memorized where the fire exits are.
</P>
<P>
   ''I bought a safety ladder,'' Merla said. ''I took a few safety
precautions I wouldn't have thought of last year.''

<HEADLINE> Flood worker accused of sexual assault  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEWTON, N.J. (AP) - A worker who had been conducting inspections
of flood-damaged houses in northern New Jersey has been charged
with sexually assaulting a 12-year-old child at one of those homes.
</P>
<P>
   Gliden Rivera, 40, was working for a California-based contractor
hired by the Federal Emergency Management Agency to conduct
inspections of damaged structures for property owners. According to
court papers, the Essex County man later returned to a home in
Hardyston and assaulted the child.
</P>
<P>
   He was charged in Sussex County on Thursday with sexual assault
and child endangerment.
</P>
<P>
   During a Friday court hearing in Newton, state Superior Court
Judge Lorraine Parker noted that Rivera has prior convictions for
similar offenses.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Computer Sciences Corp., Rivera's employer, said
the company did not perform a criminal background check on Rivera
and other employees working under the FEMA contract because they
were not required.
</P>
<P>
   FEMA spokesman Michael Beeman said the contract only required
Computer Sciences to hire people of ''good moral character.'' But
Beeman said that policy will change as of Oct. 1, when the agency
will demand criminal background checks.
</P>
<P>
   It was not known how many homes Rivera had inspected since heavy
rains flooded parts of Sussex and Morris counties on Aug. 12.
President Clinton declared the area a disaster area five days
later, and FEMA officials have been there to help residents apply
for federal aid.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera, who has addresses in Puerto Rico and Newark and who told
the judge that his mother's home in Irvington serves as his
address, was held on $250,000 bail.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Stigma Is Powerful in Caribbean  </HEADLINE>
By DAN PERRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) -- When Jemma Taylor discovered she
was HIV positive -- infected by a boyfriend who hid his condition --
she began avoiding people, slinking through back alleys to her job
as a seamstress in a small Trinidadian town.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once (people) know you are HIV or have AIDS they don't look at
you,'' she said in a soft Caribbean lilt. ''I was ashamed and I
felt alone and I didn't want anyone to know.''
</P>
<P>
   The man she loved infected Taylor, a mother of two, and two of
her relatives. Now they are among hundreds of thousands infected
with the AIDS virus in the Caribbean, a region that has done little
to stem the spiraling epidemic -- out of ignorance, lack of funds
and, some say, fear of scaring tourists away.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, a striking, articulate 27-year-old, agonized about
telling her tale; the stigma of AIDS is powerful in Trinidad, an
island of 1.3 million people where popular attention focuses on
cricket and on worsening ethnic feuds -- not on AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, however, she decided she must help shatter the
public's denial and came to tell her story in a windowless office
over grimy storefronts.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of regional apathy, AIDS advocacy groups have high
hopes that an international AIDS conference being held in Barbados
on Sept. 11-12 will put the Caribbean AIDS epidemic -- second only
to Africa's -- on the global agenda. They also hope to raise $35
million from the world's rich nations.
</P>
<P>
   Peggy McEvoy, Caribbean leader for the UNAIDS organization
cosponsoring the conference, says the region's official tally of
360,000 people infected is woefully understated. ''We presume a
half million people are infected. It's off the charts.''
</P>
<P>
   Excluding Cuba, where extensive testing and prevention keep
rates low, the Caribbean has around 25 million people. That means
one in 50 may be infected -- four times the U.S. rate. As in Africa
a decade ago, there is growing incidence among women,
heterosexuals, children and young people.
</P>
<P>
   Poverty is a factor. Haiti, the hemisphere's poorest country,
also has the highest infection rate, more than 5 percent of adults.
</P>
<P>
   Equally important are a complex of destructive societal norms,
experts say, including early sexual experience, taking multiple
partners, a religious bent discouraging discussion of sex and a
distaste among men toward condoms and submissiveness by women who
don't insist on them. Virulent homophobia also induces bisexuals to
lead secret double lives and causes people to assume wrongly that
AIDS is mainly confined to the gay community.
</P>
<P>
   Governments, with exceptions like the rich Bahamas, seem
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   In Trinidad, the National AIDS Program director, Muriel Douglas,
says her annual budget is just $100,000, much of it spent on
pamphlets informing parents about their children's sexuality. Only
some pregnant mothers are helped with AIDS medicines.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our hope is to start treating all HIV patients,'' says
Trinidad's chief medical officer, Rawle Edwards. ''Right now it has
an exorbitant cost.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozzi Warwick, a Trinidadian coordinator for UNAIDS, laments the
public's apathy about the epidemic and the lack of spending. ''If
this continues the way it's going we could be wiped off the face of
the Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   In Trinidad, one of the few to admit publicly to being HIV
positive is gay activist Godfrey Sealey. The 41-year-old playwright
became infected 17 years ago in the United States and has since
written many highly acclaimed plays about AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   ''Our leaders are megalomaniacs, power-hungry, money-grubbing
capitalists without any vision,'' he says, sitting on a plastic
chair in his sparse apartment. The public, he says, demand little
change, as they think AIDS affects primarily gays, prostitutes and
drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Sealey hopes to inspire others because he looks healthy and
unhobbled, far younger than his years. Through a maze of
connections that a lucky few call ''the medicine underground,'' he
has access to expensive anti-retrovirals that can delay the onset
of AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Dawn Catherine Yearwood has no such luck.
</P>
<P>
   The housecleaner and sometime prostitute comes from the poverty
that plagues the Caribbean, tucked away behind the beaches and the
stately homes, festering in roadside huts.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, during Trinidad's famously raucous Carnival,
she ventured out to dance while the steel bands played. Two men who
gave her drinks, she says, raped her and didn't wear a condom. Now
she is pregnant and HIV positive.
</P>
<P>
   She still meets men and has sex, she says.
</P>
<P>
   ''Sometimes I don't tell them I am HIV 'cause I'm afraid they
kill me. Sometimes I tell them and they don't want to use a condom
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked her age, she says she doesn't know and fishes an identity
card from the pile. The document, a last vestige of normalcy in a
shattered life, reveals she is 37.
</P>
<P>
   ''Look at the picture!'' she insists.
</P>
<P>
   It is unmistakably her. Younger. Prettier. Smiling.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Shakur Jameson, among the growing legion of
children born with HIV, is told in handwritten script in a
notebook. Date of birth: Sept. 9, 1997. Date confirmed, date
baptized, date admitted to the Cyril Ross Home for children with
HIV/AIDS. The eye is drawn to a terrible word, written horizontally
across the entry in red: ''Deceased.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He was one of the strong ones,'' Jacqueline John, the home's
head attendant, said of the boy who died in June at the age of two.
''Very active. There were no signs of disease. One day, after his
bath and breakfast, he asked to lie down. On the floor; they like
the coldness. By the time I found him there was nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Holding a little girl with emaciated limbs, John says Shakur's
death taught a lesson: ''Look after the strong ones! The weak ones
you mind anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost 30 children, from toddlers to a 12-year-old, live in the
clean and functional home with a doctor's office, playroom,
classroom, orderly bunkrooms. Outside there are swings and a bright
toy jeep on the roof.
</P>
<P>
   What's missing is the medicine. Less than half the children
receive donated treatments. There is no support beyond the $8,000 a
month given by a Catholic foundation, director Steve Solomon says.
</P>
<P>
   So activists struggle with little financing. Beverly King's Rap
Port project teaches young people about AIDS prevention and
misconceptions such as ''drinking bleach can prevent HIV.''
</P>
<P>
   A friend introduced Jemma Taylor to Rap Port, and from there she
found her way to the support group CARE. She was inspired by
co-founder Catherine Williams, 45, a longtime HIV carrier.
</P>
<P>
   ''The fact that she lived for 17 years and is still living, it
gives me so much encouragement,'' Taylor says. ''And then to
actually go to the CARE meetings and watch everybody -- thin, fat,
young, old -- I had been hearing so much about AIDS and HIV and how
it can affect anybody, but for the first time I was seeing it.''
</P>
<P>
   She's back using the main road, no longer trying to avoid
people.
</P>
<P>
   ''Now I dress myself, I make sure I's looking pretty, and I walk
through there,'' she says, ''and to hell with whatever people want
to say.''

<HEADLINE> Bahamian Independence Leader Dies  </HEADLINE>
By TOSHEENA ROBINSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Lynden Pindling,
leader of the Bahamas for 25 years, died Saturday of prostate
cancer. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling became premier in 1967 when the islands were still a
British colony, and led the Bahamas to independence in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   However, his reputation suffered from never-proven allegations
of bribery and protecting drug traffickers, which clouded the
country's relations with the United States and contributed to
Pindling's defeat in 1992 elections by current Prime Minister
Hubert Ingraham.
</P>
<P>
   Ingraham on Saturday hailed Pindling as ''a giant of our
times.''
</P>
<P>
   Radio and television stations broadcast tributes to the longtime
leader, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer four years ago.
Funeral arrangements were yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling's policies helped create a large black middle class by
broadening educational opportunities for the country's 172,000
people. But the Bahamas also became a major drug-trafficking haven
under his tenure in the late 1970s and 1980s, which critics blamed
on government inaction.
</P>
<P>
   A series of scandals -- he was accused of covering up for drug
lords in the 1980s and taking bribes as chairman of the state Hotel
Commission -- contributed to his party's downfall. It won only six
of the 40 seats in the National Assembly in the March 1997
elections, when Ingraham gained a second term.
</P>
<P>
   A government commission was unable to substantiate any of the
claims against Pindling.
</P>
<P>
   He told the House of Assembly in 1997, when he resigned to end
his 41-year career there, that he was ''less than perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   ''When all I did for good is put in the balance against all I
did for ill or failed to do at all, I hope that future generations
will not find me sorely wanting,'' he told legislators.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his conflicted past, Bahamians mourned the loss of the
leader known as the ''Black Moses,'' who helped found the
Progressive Liberal Party in 1953 as a grass-roots opposition to
the mostly white colonial-run United Bahamian Party.
</P>
<P>
   As news of Pindling's declining health spread in the capital,
Nassau, family and friends visited Pindling at his home Friday.
About 100 people gathered for a vigil Friday night at the First
Baptist Church in Nassau.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling was a ''man among men, whom the sons and daughters of
the Bahamas will never forget,'' the Rev. Elkin Symonette said at
the vigil. ''Because of him we know what it is like to be
independent in the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.''
</P>
<P>
   Pindling is survived by his wife, Lady Marguerite; two sons,
Obafemi, 40, and Leslie, 39; two daughters, Michelle Sands, 38, and
Monique Johnson, 34; and five grandchildren.

<HEADLINE> Park service seeks input on preserving historic structures  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   BUSHKILL, Pa. (AP) - Officials at Delaware Water Gap National
Recreation Area are seeking input from area residents on which of
the more than 160 historic properties within the park should be
restored.
</P>
<P>
   In a public meeting Friday in Bushkill, officials presented a
working draft listing each historic property within the 67,000-acre
park and highlighting 33 properties that are vacant and in need of
saving.
</P>
<P>
   A similar meeting is scheduled for Monday in Walpack, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   The historic property project, which began two years ago, has
made ''considerable progress,'' said park Superintendent Bill
Laitner.
</P>
<P>
   ''The problem is that there's not too many people willing to
spend what it costs to repair these wonderful pieces of history,''
Laitner said. Some of the properties could cost up to $1 million to
repair, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The National Park Service must decide which of the properties
are most important to residents in the area before it will continue
with any renovations.
</P>
<P>
   Those attending the meeting didn't favor any one plan over
another, said Zehra Osman, a planner for the National Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   ''They want to preserve buildings. That is what I got from
this,'' Osman said. ''I didn't hear a preference other than save
them.''

<HEADLINE> Attorney: Driver asleep, didn't know woman's car went into swamp  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) - The 21-year-old driver charged with
failing to report the accident that caused an 83-year-old
grandmother off a bridge and into a snake-infested swamp didn't
know what he hit because he had fallen asleep, his attorney says.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Andrew Campbell dozed off at the wheel, attorney Lee Cohn
said Friday, which is why he didn't realize he had hit Tillie
Tooter's car. The crash forced Tooter's Toyota off a 40-foot bridge
on Interstate 595 and into a thicket of mangrove and willow trees.
She survived on rainwater for three days before she was discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ''I believe he was sleeping,'' Cohn said. ''He told the Florida
Highway Patrol from the get-go that he struck something. He didn't
know if it was debris, a concrete barrier or another car.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell is charged with leaving the scene of an accident scene
with injuries, a felony, and filing a false police report, a
misdemeanor. The FHP arrested Campbell on Thursday, saying he told
troopers shortly after the 3 a.m. Aug. 12 accident he had hit a
retaining wall and did not tell them he had knocked a car off the
bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter had been headed to Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood
International Airport to pick up her granddaughter, Lori Simms of
Marlboro, N.J., whose flight from New Jersey had been delayed, when
she was struck from behind.
</P>
<P>
   The trees cushioned the car's fall and kept it suspended inches
above the swamp's muck and water. Tooter, a Pembroke Pines resident
originally from Brooklyn, was near death from dehydration when she
was discovered by a 15-year-old highway worker. He had noticed an
indentation in the trees and looked over the bridge.
</P>
<P>
   Tooter was released from the hospital Aug. 19 and is recovering
at home.

<HEADLINE> Martha Stewart: Proud Perfectionist  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Martha Stewart has a reputation as a
perfectionist -- and she's proud of it.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's the best rap,'' the home entertaining icon said in the
October issue of O: The Oprah Magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have proven that being a perfectionist can be profitable and
admirable when creating content across the board: in television,
books, newspapers, radio, video,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Although she is a perfectionist in her business life, her
personal life has not always been a success: She had a bitter
break-up with her former husband.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm sorry that my ex-husband and I are not friends. I'm sorry
that I haven't spoken to him -- or he hasn't spoken to me -- for all
these years,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   She also shared her regrets for only having one child, a
daughter, now 34.
</P>
<P>
   ''I like children. I get along well with them. And why I made
the decision with my husband (to have only one child), I have no
idea. It was the stupidest decision,'' she said.

   NEW YORK (AP) -- Actress Rachael Leigh Cook is trying her hand at
producing.
</P>
<P>
   The 20-year-old is the co-producer of an upcoming movie entitled

<HEADLINE> Russians Die in Chechnya Booby-Trap  </HEADLINE>
By RUSLAN MUSAYEV
<TEXT>
<P>
   GROZNY, Russia (AP) -- Two Russian soldiers were killed Saturday
in rebel Chechnya when their vehicle hit a booby-trap in the
mountains where insurgents are concentrated, military officials
said.
</P>
<P>
   The incident near the village of Dzhani-Vedeno also wounded
three other soldiers, and seven others were wounded when a
remote-controlled mine went off under their vehicle near
Bachi-Yurt, the news agency ITAR-Tass quoted the Russian military
command as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, officials said Russian forces destroyed two small
rebel units moving along trails in a republic bordering Chechnya
that has seen clashes between militants and federal troops
recently.
</P>
<P>
   The two units of four to six rebels each were destroyed in the
last 24 hours in Ingushetia, the federal command told the Interfax
news agency. Ingushetia borders Chechnya to the west and Russian
troop convoys on their way to the war zone frequently pass through
the region.
</P>
<P>
   According to the report, the two groups were discovered in the
same area where dozens of rebels clashed with Russian troops
Wednesday and Thursday. Ingushetia, which does not support
Chechnya's claim for independence, has seen several deadly ambushes
but has been unable to keep rebels from crossing the border.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Saturday, a pro-Moscow Chechen official, speaking on
condition of anonymity, said that rebels shot at federal troops 19
times in the last 24 hours. There were no reports of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   The official also said Russian troops were conducting extensive
sweeps of the city of Urus-Martan. Traffic was blocked and troops
were thoroughly checking all documents.
</P>
<P>
   After a humiliating retreat from Chechnya at the end of a
1994-1996 war, Russian troops rolled back into the separatist
region last September in a bid to end its self-proclaimed
independence and crush the rebels, who had invaded the neighboring
republic of Dagestan and who were also blamed for a series of
apartment bombings that killed some 300 people.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces occupy about two-thirds of the republic and the
rebels now are concentrated in the steep mountains of the southern
third. But some rebels have filtered back into the Russian-held
areas, including the capital Grozny, and have tormented Russian
forces with hit-and-run attacks and car bombs and have blown up
military vehicles with mines.
</P>
<P>
   A rebel field commander who uses the single name Abudar said
Saturday that insurgents are recording their planting of mines on
film and videotape because Chechen President Aslan Maskhadov has
offered sums of up to $5,000 for the destruction of tanks and
armored personnel carriers.
</P>
<P>
   Chechnya's newly elected deputy to the Russian parliament,
Aslanbek Aslakhanov, said that he was prepared to meet with
Maskhadov, the newspaper Kommersant reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Russia has repeatedly ruled out negotiations with Maskhadov
unless he gets the rebels to give up their weapons. Many of the
rebels fight under field commanders outside the control of
Maskhadov.
</P>
<P>
   Aslakhanov was elected in an Aug. 20 vote. Moscow still has not
made clear whether it will use him in efforts to end the conflict.

<HEADLINE> Company fined for medical services at prison  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) - A company that provides medical services
at a Virginia prison where two Connecticut inmates have died this
year has been fined nearly $1 million over a 13-month period for
failing to live up to its contract, The Hartford Courant reported.
</P>
<P>
   The fines, issued by the Virginia Department of Corrections
against Correctional Medical Services of St. Louis, are for
violations such as poor record-keeping, failing to triage inmates
correctly, failing to assess inmates' conditions and failing to
provide timely referrals, the Courant reported Saturday, citing a
Virginia state auditor's report.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia prison officials said they agreed with the findings and
are working with the company to bring about compliance with the
contract.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 500 Connecticut prisoners were sent to Wallens Ridge
State Prison last year to ease crowding. More than 300 remain at
Wallens Ridge, while 134 have been transferred to the Greenville
Correctional Center in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Lack of medical care is one of several complaints aired by
Wallens Ridge inmates and their advocates, who have also charged
mistreatment of the inmates at the maximum security prison.
</P>
<P>
   The report of fines comes at the same time as another report
that a diabetic inmate who died at Wallens Ridge had claimed in a
lawsuit that prison officials denied him insulin and other medical
care.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Frazier lapsed into a coma after being shocked
repeatedly with a stun gun on June 29. He died July 4.
</P>
<P>
   In a lawsuit filed May 25 in federal court in Roanoke, Frazier
claimed he nearly died on the 22-hour bus trip from Connecticut in
December because he was not given insulin, The Roanoke Times
reported in a copyrighted story for Saturday's editions. After he
arrived in Virginia, Frazier claimed, he was denied insulin on at
least two other occasions.
</P>
<P>
   A judge dismissed Frazier's lawsuit June 23, ruling that
allegations of medical malpractice alone were not enough to support
a claim of cruel and unusual punishment.
</P>
<P>
   Virginia State Auditor Walter J. Kucharski noted that
Correctional Medical Services also failed to provide inmates with a
dentist for three months and has never had an optometrist on duty,
both violations of its contract.
</P>
<P>
   Kucharski told The Courant that there is no evidence to suggest
any prisoner's health has been jeopardized.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Fields, a spokesman for CMS, said his company is working to
improve its service, but added that some of the issues raised by
the audit are beyond the company's control. Inmates cannot be taken
to the infirmary immediately because of security procedures in
high-security prisons such as Wallens Ridge, Fields said.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Michael Lawlor, D-East Haven, said the auditor's
report further convinces him that Connecticut's prisoners should be
returned. Lawlor said state residents should be concerned about the
treatment of Connecticut inmates in Virginia because the $12
million contract between the two states would make Connecticut
liable for potential civil rights lawsuits filed by prisoners or
their families.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Polce, spokeswoman for the Connecticut Department of
Correction, said the department is confident Virginia officials
will address the issues raised in the report.

crashed outside Paris, victims' relatives gathered Saturday to
remember their loved ones near the site where the supersonic jet
went down.
</P>
<P>
   Family members were flown in from Germany by Air France, which
suspended all Concorde flights immediately after the July 25 crash
outside Gonesse, a small town nine miles northeast of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the crash victims were Germans flying to New York to

</P>
<P>
   Journalists were not allowed to approach the site Saturday.
Family members were seen crying and holding red carnations after a
brief visit to the site.
</P>
<P>
   A technical investigation is being carried out by the Accident
and Inquiry Office, a part of the French Transportation Ministry.
The office is expected to release a preliminary report on the crash
on August 31.

   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- Eighteen cats stood vigil for a week over
the body of their master and attacked policemen who came to remove
his corpse, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bahgat Mostafa Said, 63, a retired Egyptian civil servant, loved
cats. He had 18 of them, police said.

   When Said died Aug. 19 in his apartment in the Cairo suburb of

A week later, police came to investigate a smell coming from the
apartment. They found Said surrounded by his feline family.
</P>
<P>
   When police officers approached the body, the cats set upon
them, scratching ferociously, a police spokesman said on condition

<HEADLINE> U.S. Says Drug Operation Dismantled  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. officials said Saturday that they have
broken up a major drug trafficking operation that used commercial
ships to haul Colombian cocaine around the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Drug Enforcement Administration and the U.S. Customs Service
said 43 people have been arrested and almost 25 tons of cocaine
confiscated during the two-year investigation, dubbed ''Operation
Journey.'' Officials believe the organization transported at least
68 tons of cocaine to 12 nations over three years.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the operation was announced in recent days by
Venezuelan officials, who said they seized 10 tons of cocaine and
arrested 16 people in a series of raids.
</P>
<P>
   Among those in custody is the suspected leader of the
organization, Ivan de la Vega, a Colombian citizen arrested Aug. 16
in Venezuela. He has been turned over to U.S. custody and faces
charges in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   The operation began as separate investigations by the Drug
Enforcement Administration office in Athens, Greece, the Customs
office in Houston and other agencies. The investigations were
eventually united and coordinated by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, Customs described the organization as ''a
one-stop shipping service for Colombian cartels interested in
moving cocaine via maritime vessels to U.S. and European markets.''
</P>
<P>
   The organization used eight to 10 freighters. Some were owned by
the organization; others by shipping companies in Greece and other
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Cocaine would be transported by land or air from Colombia to the
Orinoco River Delta in northeastern Venezuela. It would be hidden
in the jungle before being taken by boats to offshore freighters.
It would then be stored in secret compartments until it reached its
destination, where boats carried it ashore.
</P>
<P>
   The organization would try to throw off investigators by making
''dry runs'' with legitimate cargo. But working with foreign police
agencies, the DEA and Customs obtained information about specific
cocaine shipments heading to Europe, Customs said.
</P>
<P>
   ''This case demonstrates what can be achieved when nations of
the world work together against a common enemy,'' Customs
Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said in the statement.
</P>
<P>
   ''Law enforcement has forged the international alliances
required to cripple sophisticated transnational criminal
organizations like de la Vega'' and ''Operation Journey is only the
beginning,'' said DEA Administrator Donnie Marshall.

<HEADLINE> Putin Honors Sunken Submarine's Crew  </HEADLINE>
By JIM HEINTZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW (AP) -- Russian President Vladimir Putin conferred
posthumous state honors Saturday on the 118 men who died aboard the
Kursk, two weeks after the nuclear submarine sank in an accident
that shocked the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Hero of Russia order, one of the country's highest honors,
was awarded to the submarine's commander, Capt. Gennady Lyachin.
The Order of Courage was awarded to the others, news agencies
reported, citing the presidential press service.
</P>
<P>
   Putin also ordered that the crew, whose bodies still lie at the
bottom of the Barents Sea, be commemorated with a display at the
Central Military Museum in Moscow, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
   The order came as the country grapples with the loss of one of
Russia's most modern navy vessels.
</P>
<P>
   Military prosecutors have begun a criminal investigation into
allegations that the Kursk collided with an unidentified vessel
that later escaped, the Interfax news agency reported Saturday.
Citing unidentified sources, Interfax said the prosecutors believe
the vessel violated safety rules and was directly responsible for
the sinking of the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman at the military prosecutor's office could not
confirm the report Saturday. An investigation by the
prosecutor-general's office had been announced previously.
</P>
<P>
   Russian experts have not conclusively determined what was
responsible for two explosions aboard the Kursk, which went down
Aug. 12 during military exercises in the Barents. Military
officials claim the most likely scenario was that the Kursk
collided with another vessel, most likely a foreign submarine.
</P>
<P>
   Both Britain and the United States denied their submarines
collided with the Kursk.
</P>
<P>
   Interfax said the alleged vessel was being investigated for
''violation of safety rules in the movement and use of rail, air or
water transport, which resulted in the death of two or more people
because of carelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   Some observers say the most likely reason for the sinking was an
internal malfunction and explosion in the submarine's torpedo
compartment. Russian officials also have not ruled out the
possibility that the Kursk hit a World War II-era mine.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of the disaster probably won't be known until experts
study the shattered submarine more closely to see if it can be
raised. Russia is negotiating with Norwegian and Dutch companies to
bring up the wreckage.
</P>
<P>
   Russian officials have sought to quash concern around the world
over the Kursk's two nuclear reactors. Officials say there is no
sign of unusual radiation levels around the submarine, but there is
growing concern that the reactors are not safe and may begin
leaking.
</P>
<P>
   Many Russians accused the government of being slow to react to
the sinking and of bungling rescue efforts. Some observers have
said the allegation that a foreign vessel was responsible for the
disaster is an attempt to deflect blame away from faults within
Russia's poorly maintained and cash-strapped armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   During several days of attempts by Russian mini-submarines to
dock with the sunken Kursk's aft escape hatch, officials said the
hatch was severely damaged. But a Norwegian-British team of divers
that eventually succeeded in opening the hatch said it was in good
shape.
</P>
<P>
   ''There was evidence of what looked liked cracking, but it
turned out to be signs of regular movement of the rubber panels ...
and that could be construed as damage,'' one of the divers, Tony
Scott, told The Associated Press on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ''When the Russians were performing their operations in the
beginning, I think the conditions were a lot different and there
was less visibility,'' he said by telephone from Tromsoe, Norway.

<HEADLINE> Hollywood Bowl May Lose Landmark  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Hollywood Bowl, the outdoor concert hall
that has featured musical legends from the Beatles to Barbra
Streisand, may lose the trademark orchestral shell that's made it a
city landmark.
</P>
<P>
   After years of trying to repair the 71-year-old shell, which has
notoriously poor acoustics, officials with the Los Angeles
Philharmonic are proposing to spend $18 million for a bigger, more
modern structure that would have a similar, but not exact design of
the current shell.
</P>
<P>
   The plan, which will be debated before the Los Angeles County
Board of Supervisors next month, is pitting music lovers against
preservationists who view the imposing structure as a cultural
icon.
</P>
<P>
   ''To us, the shell of the Hollywood Bowl is the visual symbol of
the bowl itself and one of the most identifiable icons of Los
Angeles,'' said Ken Bernstein, director of preservation issues for
the Los Angeles Conservancy. ''How serious are the acoustical
needs? And are they serious enough to warrant the demolition of
this important symbol?''
</P>
<P>
   Music aficionados say they are, and that the Hollywood Bowl
should provide a higher-quality musical experience to its visitors.
</P>
<P>
   The bowl, which has a seating capacity of almost 18,000, offers
popular summer programs of outdoor concerts and fireworks displays,
complete with picnicking under the stars. But the current orchestra
shell is so small that sometimes one-third of the musicians are
forced to sit outside it where they can't hear each other.
</P>
<P>
   The aging icon has other problems too. It's riddled with
asbestos and covered with lead paint. It leaks in the rain and the
lighting system is unwieldy. A series of repairs have failed to
correct the problems.
</P>
<P>
   The sweeping, luminous white shell was built by Allied
Architects and modeled after one created in 1928 by architect Lloyd
Wright, the eldest son of Frank Lloyd Wright. In 1980, Los Angeles
architect Frank Gehry created the fiberglass spheres that hang from
the Bowl's shell to enhance the acoustics.
</P>
<P>
   The plans for the new shell call for a design reminiscent of the
1930s, featuring simple lines and geometric shapes. The shell would
be 30 percent larger, and as part of the effort to improve
acoustics a reflector would be placed above the entire orchestra to
reflect sound, a device common in modern facilities. Other
improvements would be made too.
</P>
<P>
   Demolition of the old shell and construction of the new one
would be funded by money approved by county voters in 1996. The
construction would be completed by summer 2002, with most of the
work occurring during the bowl's off-season so performance
schedules would not be affected, Philharmonic officials said.

<HEADLINE> Crenshaw Happy With Earlier Music  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA MONICA, Calif. (AP) -- Marshall Crenshaw may be a critics'
darling, but the singer-songwriter insists he has never been
satisfied with his 1982 debut album -- until its recent re-issue.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was raw and unformed as a singer, kind of groping vocally on
some of those tracks,'' he said. ''I have these criticisms of it,
but I'm fond of it.''
</P>
<P>
   The self-titled album won him raves from critics, but Crenshaw,
whose hits include ''Something's Gonna Happen,'' and ''What Do You
Dream Of?,'' has since struggled for broad commercial success.
</P>
<P>
   While writing songs for his first album, Crenshaw, 46, said he
was ''rediscovering and dealing with'' the rock 'n' roll of his
youth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was really listening to a lot of rockabilly and getting back
into stuff I knew during childhood and was getting back to it as an
adult,'' he said while promoting a Santa Monica concert scheduled
for Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Rhino Records last week simultaneously rereleased his first
album with 10 bonus tracks along with a greatest hits collection
entitled ''This Is Easy: The Best of Marshall Crenshaw''
</P>
<P>
   Crenshaw said compiling the music gave him a greater
appreciation for his work.
</P>
<P>
   ''Until I did this 'Best of,' I had this ambivalence about the
records I've made,'' he said. ''But now I just feel like its a good
body of work. Its all kind of resolved for me at this point.''

<HEADLINE> Tours given at one of state's oldest prisons and at one of its newest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   ROMULUS, N.Y. (AP) - It was a chance to see artifacts from one
of the oldest prisons in the state and to tour one of its newest.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday marked open house at the ''big house,'' with tours
offered at Eastern prison in Napanoch and the new $180 million
maximum-security Five Points Correctional Facility in Romulus.
</P>
<P>
   In Ulster County, the Eastern tour was part of an ongoing
centennial celebration of New York's sixth-oldest prison.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors could view Eastern's Braille transcription unit,
historical photos, a video cataloging Eastern's first 100 years and
other artifacts. Some artifacts were even on sale.
</P>
<P>
   Original construction on Eastern began in 1894, and the first
prisoners arrived at the facility on October 1, 1900. In 1921,
Eastern became the Institute for Defective Delinquents. Some 45
years later, due to civil liberties efforts, Eastern resumed its
original function as a reformatory for younger inmates.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1973, it has primarily served as a maximum-security prison
for male felons aged 16 and over. A medium-security, 180-inmate
annex also is on the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   The prison now houses 1,247 inmates and employs approximately
600.
</P>
<P>
   In Romulus, the new prison is being praised by leaders around
Seneca County for its potential boon to the economy.
</P>
<P>
   The prison is built to house 1,500 inmates, scheduled to arrive
this week. With an annual budget of $25 million, it provides 640
full-time jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ''In an ideal world, it would be nice not to have prisons at
all,'' said Glenn Cooke, the county's economic developer. ''But the
fact is, it's not an ideal world. If we are going to have them, we
might as well have them in areas where they fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Sabara, a real estate agent in Ovid, Seneca County, south
of the prison, said the construction brought more renters. And he
estimates housing sales are up about 15 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The economy was devastated in the 1990s by the downsizing and
eventual closure of the 10,600-acre depot, which had employed more
than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Residents had opposed a proposal to place the prison on the
former Sampson Air Force Base overlooking Seneca Lake, saying it
would hurt tourism.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. Michael F. Nozzolio and others pushed for the current
site, which, at two stories, cannot be seen from nearby highways.

<HEADLINE> Somalia Lawmakers Elect President  </HEADLINE>
By OSMAN HASSAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- With men, women and children dancing
and singing in the streets, Somalis celebrated the election of
their first president in almost a decade with a unity that will be
vital if the new head of state is to fulfill his promise of
bringing peace to Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   Hours after Abdiqasim Salad Hassan, a former interior minister,
won presidential elections early Saturday, people around the
country took to the streets, businesses shut down and restaurants
offered free meals in what became a spontaneous national holiday.
</P>
<P>
   ''It doesn't matter who is the president, but a government that
can tackle the current political, social and economic problem is
what we needed,'' said an elated Mohamed Mohamud Warsameh, the
district commissioner of Dhusamareb, 320 miles north of the
capital.
</P>
<P>
   In Mogadishu, women wept.
</P>
<P>
   ''This will definitely be the end of insecurity in Mogadishu.
Business will boom,'' said a tearful Mariam Mohamed Hassan.
</P>
<P>
   And in a significant move Saturday, representatives of
Mogadishu's business community pledged their full backing to the
new assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ''We first congratulate the Somali parliament and then the
president. We pledge both our moral and material support to the
forthcoming government,'' businessman Hajji Abukar Omar Addan said
after a group meeting.
</P>
<P>
   The support of the business community, in terms of the cash and
militias they have been forced to employ for security purposes, is
seen as crucial.
</P>
<P>
   Addan is known to employ 400 gunmen and controls a 25-mile
stretch of road along the northeastern coast of the capital to the
port of El Ma'an.
</P>
<P>
   Somalia has been a byword for chaos and violence and has had no
central government since opposition leaders joined forces to oust
dictator Mohamed Siad Barre in 1991. Faction leaders then fought
with each other, turning the Horn of Africa nation into battling
fiefdoms ruled by heavily armed militias.
</P>
<P>
   The election of Hassan, who promised to bring economic recovery
and peace to the nation of 7 million, came as a result of a
conference that began in Arta, a small town in neighboring
Djibouti, on May 2.
</P>
<P>
   The brainchild of Djibouti President Ismael Omar Guelleh, it was
the 13th attempt at finding a peaceful solution to Somalia's
troubles.
</P>
<P>
   The conference, viewed with skepticism by the international
community, involved some 2,000 Somali elders, religious leaders and
business leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to be representative of Somalia's clan structure, it
was the first to include non-faction leaders and was virtually
closed to the outside world -- keys, observers say, to its apparent
success.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 13, a 225-member assembly was inaugurated, with each of
Somalia's four main clans represented by 49 candidates, including
five women each.
</P>
<P>
   An alliance of smaller clans was given the right to name 29
members, and the body was later expanded to 245 members to placate
subclans who felt unrepresented.
</P>
<P>
   The parliament currently sits in Arta and will only move to
Somalia when a prime minister and Cabinet have been appointed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, with the exception of some faction leaders and the
self-appointed heads of the breakaway regions of Puntland and
Somaliland, support for the parliament has been unanimous.
</P>
<P>
   After the announcement of Hassan's victory, the sound of heavy
machine gun and anti-aircraft fire immediately reverberated around
Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to living in a volatile world, Somalis were at first
terrified -- then relieved when they realized that the shooting was
in celebration, not anger.
</P>
<P>
   The real test for the new president -- a 58-year-old member of
the powerful Hawiye clan -- and parliament will be when they move to
Somalia.
</P>
<P>
   The assembly faces the daunting task of persuading faction
leaders opposed to the peace process to respect it, recruit the
militiamen who cruise the streets into new national security force
and then set about collecting taxes.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement Friday, Muse Sudi Yalahow, a militia leader in
southwest Mogadishu, said the initiative was a ''national plot''
masterminded by Djibouti in collaboration with Somali elements
whose aim was ''instigating a new round of fighting between
Somalis.''
</P>
<P>
   Another opposed to the parliament, Hussein Mohamed Aidid, who
controls part of south Mogadishu, has been using Radio Voice of the
People, a station he controls, to deride the new assembly and its
Djiboutian backers.
</P>
<P>
   International support will also be vital for a country which has
seen its infrastructure virtually destroyed and for a parliament
which will go home penniless.

<HEADLINE> US Team Leads Gulf Air Investigation  </HEADLINE>
By CAROLINE RNE
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) -- Aviation experts began an investigation
Saturday into the crash of Gulf Air Flight 072, examining the
plane's tail that still juts out of the sea like a gravestone for
the 143 passengers and crew who perished.
</P>
<P>
   The United States is leading the team of more than 20 inspectors
from Bahrain, France, Egypt and Oman. Their job will be to piece
together clues from the wreckage to determine why the Airbus 320,
flying from Cairo, crashed Wednesday in near-perfect conditions
just off Bahrain's coast.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-man advance team began Saturday by photographing an
expanse of sea littered with scraps. Mobile phones and clothing
bobbed in the water, although most of the personal effects had been
retrieved by divers from Bahrain and the U.S. Navy's 5th Fleet,
which is headquartered in Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're going to map out the wreckage area and where the pieces
are,'' said one of three investigators from the U.S. National
Transportation Safety Board. ''Obviously, then we still have to
pull the stuff out.''
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen wreckage pieces, several still in the sea, have been
logged as ''significant'' so far.
</P>
<P>
   ''Time is now of the essence because of the sand,'' said
Bahraini Col. James Windsor, who is coordinating the salvage work.
''If you don't recover them in the next few days, it will cover up
the pieces.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigators, in addition to an Airbus Industries
representative, will have other evidence to rely on, including the
plane's flight data and voice cockpit recorders. The recorders were
to be flown to Washington on Saturday night for analysis.
</P>
<P>
   The team hopes to pinpoint what happened between the time pilot
Ihsan Shakeeb aborted his landing at Manama's airport without
explanation and the plane's dive into the sea 60 seconds later.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air's chief pilot Hameed Ali has said investigators would
examine the speed and altitude of Shakeeb's aborted landing as part
of their probe. But, he stressed, ''we have spotted no error in
(Shakeeb's) approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, caskets wrapped in blue plaid cloth were loaded aboard
a Gulf Air Boeing 767 bound for Cairo. Sixty-four Egyptians were
killed in the crash, and 56 of the bodies headed home Saturday,
along with about 100 relatives who had come to Bahrain to identify
them.
</P>
<P>
   Some 200 more grieving mourners were at the Cairo airport when
the plane arrived. Women in black wailed as the victims' names were
called out. Relatives were led to ambulances taking the bodies to
separate burial services.
</P>
<P>
   Some men and women ran after the vehicles, desperate for a final
look.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is the hardest thing on earth for us,'' said Ali Mohammed
Hassan, whose cousin, Reda Hassan, died on the flight.
</P>
<P>
   Not all the relatives and friends of the 64 Egyptians killed in
the crash were able to say farewell and bury their loved ones
Saturday: Eight of the Egyptian victims had been misidentified in
Bahrain, and the whereabouts of their bodies were still being
pinpointed. Many victims were dismembered or badly disfigured by
the plane's impact in the sea, making it very difficult to identify
them from photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Wafaei Aziz burst into tears as he told how his cousin's wife,
Nevine, and her son, Robert, who were Christians, had received
Muslim funeral rites in Bahrain. Nevine had been taken for a
Bahraini woman and Robert identified as a Palestinian, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
   ''We don't even know what happened to those bodies. We heard
they buried her at Bahrain,'' said Wafaei, who waited at the
airport for more than an hour in the hope of finding his relatives
among the bodies returned.
</P>
<P>
   Muslim and Christian clerics moved among the relatives, offering
comfort and support.
</P>
<P>
   But some mourners were inconsolable. One woman was slapping her
cheeks in a gesture of grief and yelling: ''Oh! Sister, you left
me. I don't have anyone but you!''
</P>
<P>
   Among those who were buried Saturday was Yehia Abdou Shalaby. An
ambulance took his body to a mosque, where it was washed, and then
to a cemetery in northwest Cairo. Relatives and friends wailed and
cried as Shalaby's corpse, wrapped in white cloth, was lifted out
of the coffin and lowered into a grave.
</P>
<P>
   Gulf Air has said 135 passengers and eight crew members were on
board Flight 072. In addition to the Egyptians aboard, there were
36 Bahrainis, 12 Saudi Arabians, nine Palestinians, six people from
the United Arab Emirates, three Chinese, two British, two Omanis
and one person from each of the United States, Canada, Kuwait,
Sudan, Australia, the Philippines, Poland, India and Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Embassy in Bahrain held a private memorial service
Saturday for the American victim, Seth Foti, a 31-year-old
diplomatic courier. Foti's body was expected to arrive in
Washington, D.C., on Sunday, and a funeral is being planned in his
hometown of Browntown, Va.

<HEADLINE> Seattle-based grunge band asks for blanket ban  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

	   SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) - Pearl Jam is playing it safe this
time.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after nine fans died in a frenzied crush during a set
by the Seattle-based grunge band, its manager asked fans to leave
blankets at home during a concert at Saratoga Performing Arts
Center scheduled for Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ''We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we have
witnessed a number of injuries as a result of blankets being used
as trampolines at concerts,'' said Pearl Jam manager Kelly Curtis.
''Small beach towels and ponchos will be allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this season, the company that manages SPAC's outdoor
rock shows forbade blankets. After a public outcry, it relented.
</P>
<P>
   Pearl Jam has affected safety at the amphitheater in the past.
After its 1992 show, metal barriers were installed to prevent stage
rushes.

<HEADLINE> Parole backlog in New Jersey bigger than anticipated  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   TRENTON, N.J. (AP) - The state attorney general's office has
learned that a backlog of parole cases in New Jersey is much
greater than originally anticipated, news that could complicate
negotiations to settle a lawsuit brought by a group of prison
inmates.
</P>
<P>
   According to a review conducted by the attorney general's
office, 195 additional inmates were found to be eligible for parole
hearings.
</P>
<P>
   Six weeks ago, after originally saying the backlog was no more
than several hundred cases, the state attorney general's office
said the number of New Jersey inmates awaiting hearings with the
Parole Board was about 2,800.
</P>
<P>
   But state officials learned that the extent of the problem was
far greater.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a spokesman for Gov. Christie Whitman said the
backlog had reached a peak of 3,409 cases. Pete McDonough told The
Philadelphia Inquirer for Saturday's editions that a review of
about 4,200 additional files found an additional 195 inmates
eligible for parole hearings with hundreds more reaching
eligibility.
</P>
<P>
   The news came amid the state's negotiations to settle a lawsuit
brought this year by a group of inmates at Riverfront State Prison
in Camden. The lawsuit claims the inmates were incarcerated while
eligible for release.
</P>
<P>
   McDonough said the Whitman administration had hoped to settle
the lawsuit by promising to end the backlog within eight months.
Paul Loriquet, a spokesman for the attorney general's office, said
that timetable is still possible.
</P>
<P>
   Both said the Parole Board has been handling an average of 100
cases per week, but the backlog still stands at 2,700.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Mauer, assistant director of the Sentencing Project in
Washington, D.C., said it is possible that New Jersey has the
largest backlog in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ''It seems way out of line, given the evidence we have heard
from other states,'' Mauer said.
</P>
<P>
   Loriquet declined to comment on the lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   The Parole Board, already facing criticism for its backlog, is
also the subject of a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Consovoy resigned as chairman in July; Robert Egles, the
board's executive director, has taken medical leave; and Peter
Loos, another member, has asked Whitman not to reappoint him.
</P>
<P>
   The criminal investigation involved Consovoy's dealings with
former organized crime figures, including one who was paroled after
a personal hearing with the chairman.

<HEADLINE> Man gives up job as business consultant to make music for kids  </HEADLINE>
By PAT EATON-ROBB
<TEXT>
<P>
   WETHERSFIELD, Conn. (AP) - Steve Roslonek says he was happy
working for a national consulting firm, solving the business
systems problems of clients across the country.
</P>
<P>
   But he's happier singing to preschoolers about Joey the Frog.
</P>
<P>
   Roslonek, 28, gave up his three-piece suits, professional
salary, and business lunches 1&AMP;frac12; years ago to pursue a risky career
as a children's entertainer and song writer.
</P>
<P>
   He now spends his time writing, recording and performing -
mostly performing. He sets aside two weeks a month for day-care
shows. He's booked through June 2001. The rest of the time he tours
schools and libraries throughout New England.
</P>
<P>
   His new job doesn't pay as well as the old one - he earned about
$70,000 at Anderson Consulting in Hartford, a job he held for over
four years after graduating with an economics degree from Wesleyan
University. Last year, he made about $18,000, before taking into
account the $10,000 he spent on equipment and studio time.
</P>
<P>
   ''But it's not a decision I regret,'' Roslonek said as he
prepared for a recent show before about 200 kids and their parents
at Wethersfield Town Hall. ''Working with kids and writing is
something I feel I was meant to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Roslonek, who grew up in Wethersfield and now lives in Boston,
has become something of a cult figure on New England's kiddie music
circuit. He's not nearly as well known as artists like Raffi, but
many who have heard his music become devoted fans.
</P>
<P>
   Marguerite Alpert, of Wethersfield, said her 3-year-old daughter
Grace saw her first ''Steve concert'' in December. After the show,
Grace began carrying his picture with her everywhere, calling him
''my Steve.'' Her family has been to see Roslonek six times since
then, and paid for him to play a concert in their neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   His high-energy delivery gets his little listeners involved
acting out the lyrics.
</P>
<P>
   ''He makes a connection, because he can be really goofy, and
he's genuinely warm,'' she said. ''He obviously has a clear memory
of his boyhood.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of his songs also appeal to parents, including this song
about a boy who wants his ice cream, but doesn't want to eat his
peas to get it:
</P>
<P>
   ''There's a pea on my plate
</P>
<P>
   that my mother put there.
</P>
<P>
   Peas make me vomit,
</P>
<P>
   but she doesn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   Roslonek wrote his first children's song for the daughter of a
girlfriend in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was just so fun, and people liked it,'' he said. ''I just
couldn't stop. They just kind of wrote themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   His first album, ''Morning 'Til Night,'' was released in
December 1998. He quit his consulting job two months later.
</P>
<P>
   Some of coworkers thought he was crazy, said Sandy Fenton, of
East Hampton. She worked with Roslonek at Anderson, and now brings
her three children to see him sing.
</P>
<P>
   ''Once I heard his music, I knew right away that he was going to
succeed,'' she said. ''He was very good at what he did and the
management thought very highly of him. They were very sad when he
left, but I think they knew he had to follow his heart.''
</P>
<P>
   Roslonek doesn't have a big recording contract. He markets his
music over the Internet and sells his CDs at shows. In May his
first CD won an award from the Parents' Choice Foundation. His
second CD, ''On a Flying Guitar,'' came out in July.
</P>
<P>
   He has developed different shows for different age levels,
offering songs about spinning and playing for toddlers. But at
elementary schools, he will put on workshops for third-, fourth-
and fifth-graders, helping them write songs about whatever they are
studying.
</P>
<P>
   ''All the stuff I like about consulting, I still get to do every
day,'' he said. ''I really liked creating things, creative problem
solving, and working with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve hopes to make it big someday, and play before thousands of
fans in concert halls. But for now, he's happy with a career that
lets him lead a conga line of giggling, singing 4-year-olds through
the town halls, libraries and day-care centers across New England.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's like going downstairs for Christmas and not knowing what
you're going to get, but knowing you're going to be excited about
it, '' he said.

small island south of Tokyo on Saturday -- the latest exodus amid
fears that a ''fairly big'' eruption could spout from a reawakened
volcano, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
   With Saturday's departures, almost one-third of Miyake island's
3,850 residents have left for other parts of Japan since Aug. 19,
said local official Takashi Hasegawa.
</P>
<P>
   The exodus began a day after Mount Oyama threw up a five-mile
column of ash mixed with volcanic rock on Aug. 18. It was the
biggest eruption since the 2,686-foot volcano rumbled back to life
on July 9.
</P>
<P>
   ''People are leaving because there's a possibility of a fairly
big eruption,'' Hasegawa said.
</P>
<P>
   He said 1,152 people have fled Miyake island, including 211
children, or about two-thirds of the island's school population.
Most have sought refuge in Tokyo, about 120 miles to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Experts speculate that shifts in huge underground pools of magma
are responsible for recent volcanic and seismic activity on Miyake,
part of a chain of volcanic islands off Tokyo that stretch 335
miles from north to south.
</P>
<P>
   Mount Oyama's last big eruption was in 1983. Five hundred homes
were destroyed when lava flowed over its western flank, though
timely evacuations prevented any casualties.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Affiliate: Congo Abuses Abound  </HEADLINE>
By ARNAUD ZAJTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   KINSHASA, Congo (AP) -- A U.N. human rights investigator has
accused Congo's government and rebels of continued abuses in the
war-divided Central African nation, citing the jailing of political
opponents and reports of civilian massacres.
</P>
<P>
   Roberto Garreton, a Chilean lawyer who in the past has accused
both sides of killings and torture, was making his third visit to
Congo in the past two years. During a news briefing Friday at the
end of his 13-day trip, he said killings are the biggest problem in
rebel-held areas of the country, while improper jailings are common
in government-controlled regions.
</P>
<P>
   Garreton's trip included stops in several regions to examine
human rights issues and the condition of detention facilities. He
said there had been some improvements in government-held areas, but
he noted that he was denied access to some facilities there. He
also said the government has jailed political opponents and
journalists.
</P>
<P>
   In rebel-controlled areas, civilians are living in fear in the
wake of recent massacres, Garreton said. He said civilians
allegedly had been killed because they helped traditional Mayi-Mayi
fighters, who are backing the government of President Laurent
Kabila. He did not offer details.
</P>
<P>
   Garreton said no independent newspapers or radio stations were
allowed to operate in rebel-held areas.
</P>
<P>
   He applauded both the government and a Rwandan-backed rebel
faction for beginning to demobilize child soldiers, while singling
out Uganda for continuing to use them in parts of Congo.
</P>
<P>
   Garreton plans to release a full report in November, but he
noted that his reports generally ''have little effect.''
</P>
<P>
   Relations between the United Nations and Congo have been
strained ever since U.N. officials began investigating massacres of
Rwandan Hutu refugees -- allegedly by forces loyal to Kabila and
aided by Rwanda and Uganda. The United Nations sent human rights
experts to Congo in June 1997 to investigate the massacres, but
withdrew them 10 months later because of what it called a total
lack of cooperation from the Congolese government.
</P>
<P>
   Fighting in Congo restarted in 1998 when rebel forces backed by
Rwanda and Uganda tried to oust Kabila, who had support from
Angola, Namibia and Zimbabwe. The Rwanda-Uganda alliance fell apart
after they backed rival rebel groups, and the two countries turned
their guns on each other in June in the city of Kisangani.
</P>
<P>
   Under a peace agreement signed last summer, 5,537 U.N. observers
were to be stationed in Congo to supervise a cease-fire and the
withdrawal of foreign forces. So far, only 264 U.N. military
observers and about 15 international staff have been deployed.

<HEADLINE> India Newspaper Office Blown Up  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Two armed militants herded employees out
of a newspaper office and set off a powerful bomb inside the
building Saturday in India's insurgency-ridden northeast, a
domestic news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   No one was hurt in the daily Lamyanba's office in Imphal, the
capital of remote, hilly Manipur state, Press Trust of India said.
Lamyanba, formerly a monthly journal, is to be launched as a
newspaper next month.
</P>
<P>
   The two men forced about 50 people out of the office at gunpoint
before planting the bomb. The explosion caused extensive damage to
the building and two cars parked outside, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
   No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion came a week after the killing of Thaunaojam
Brajamani, the editor of another local newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   A dozen groups are fighting security forces in Manipur for
causes ranging from more autonomy to secession from India. More
than 10,000 people have been killed in the state's two-decade-long
insurgency.

<HEADLINE> Town hall spat turns physical  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   POUGHKEEPSIE, N.Y. (AP) - A town known of late for its scandals
can now add town hall shoving matches to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Police say Town Supervisor Ann Barcher and Councilwoman Marlene
Galow engaged in a physical confrontation at town hall Friday,
apparently over an ongoing investigation into the assessor's
office.
</P>
<P>
   Barcher said Galow entered her office uninvited, and accused
Barcher of stealing the computer. Barcher had just given police the
computer hard drive as evidence in the probe.
</P>
<P>
   Barcher said Galow wouldn't leave, and began flailing her arms
when Barcher opened a door to the hallway. Barcher said she then
tried to shove Galow out of the office.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had to physically eject her from my office because she
refused to leave,'' Barcher said, calm and looking unmarked from
the scuffle. ''I will clean up the town. ''If that means an
investigation of the assessor's office, well...''
</P>
<P>
   Barcher said she was planning to file a formal complaint with
police against Galow following the incident. Police photographed
what Barcher said was a mark on her neck where Galow apparently hit
her, according to Barcher.
</P>
<P>
   Galow would not comment on any police action that may have been
taken. However, she did say she hired two lawyers to look into the
incident.
</P>
<P>
   Barcher, a Democrat, and the Democrat-dominated town board have
been at odds since first coming into office in January. Before last
November's election, Galow and Barcher were frequent political
allies. But Democrat Galow and other town board members often
disagree with the supervisor on issues - most recently the board's
intention to hire a town administrator who would replace the
supervisor as Poughkeepsie's day-to-day manager.
</P>
<P>
   The town has been under a federal probe since assessor Basil
Raucci disappeared on Oct. 4 1997, the day after being confronted
by an FBI agent. His body was found in the Hudson River.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, two town officials were convicted on corruption-related
charges. Other things that have happened here include: a mother of
two being shot to death leaving church choir practice; a political
boss's conviction of running a shakedown scheme; the town water
supervisor's firing a bullet into his head as police came to his
door; the aforesaid official being accused of orchestrating a
lesbian tryst in a town pump station.

<HEADLINE> Ivory Coast Vote Postpone Requested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) -- The National Electoral Commission
has asked Ivory Coast's junta to postpone next month's presidential
elections so it can better prepare for the vote that is to return
the country to civilian rule, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Commission President Honore Guie said the body needs more time
to register voters, prepare election guidelines and order and
distribute balloting materials before the Sept. 17 vote.
</P>
<P>
   The commission requested that the first round of voting be
postponed until Oct. 15 or Oct. 22, he said in a statement
broadcast on state-run radio and television. A second round will be
organized if no candidate wins more than 50 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate response from the ruling military junta.
</P>
<P>
   The elections come amid mounting tension in Ivory Coast, which
was considered a bastion of stability in volatile West Africa
before a Dec. 24 coup.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military takeover was initially popular among
Ivorians, who had grown tired of corruption and ethnic favoritism
under ousted President Henri Konan Bedie, many have since become
disillusioned with the new regime.
</P>
<P>
   Disgruntled soldiers have mutinied twice over bonuses and perks
they say they were promised for supporting the coup. There has been
no improvement in the economy, which has been hobbled by plummeting
prices for the country's main exports, cocoa and coffee. And many
believe the junta's policies are fueling the same ethnic tensions
that divided the country under Bedie.
</P>
<P>
   Junta leader Gen. Robert Guei is among 19 candidates who have
registered with the electoral commission to run for president. The
candidacies must be approved by the Supreme Court, which has until
Sept. 2 to confirm their eligibility.

<HEADLINE> 20 Arrested at Student Party in Va.  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARRISONBURG, Va. (AP) -- A back-to-school block party just off
the James Madison University campus turned into a melee early
Saturday that was broken up by police. Twenty people were arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Police in riot gear used pepper spray and gas canisters to
disperse an unruly crowd of more than 2,000 -- mostly students --
that pelted officers with rocks and bottles.
</P>
<P>
   ''The tear gas is ridiculous. I've never seen this kind of
situation before in all my four years here, but the fact that
people are throwing bottles at the police isn't helping much
either,'' senior Scott Wilson told the school's student newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they tried to break up the party at about 11:30 p.m.
Friday after receiving complaints. One officer suffered minor
injuries, and the party was broken up by 2:30 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   James Madison, a public university with an enrollment of 15,000,
is about 130 miles northwest of Richmond. Founded in 1908, it is
named for the nation's fourth president.
</P>
<P>
   Messages left for school officials Saturday were not immediately
returned.

<HEADLINE> Plattsburgh mill may be sold  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   PLATTSBURGH, N.Y. (AP) - Negotiations are underway for Georgia
Pacific's mill here to be sold, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The plan is to continue to run the mill as it is run,'' said
spokeswoman Marta Pauer-Tursi. She acknowledged, however, that once
the plant is sold, it will have no control over that.
</P>
<P>
   With 527 workers, Georgia-Pacific is Plattsburgh's
second-largest employer, with an annual payroll of about $25
million.
</P>
<P>
   As Pauer-Tursi spoke with reporters Friday, employees at the
plant were being informed about the potential sale.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's an honor really,'' said Peter Seguin, president of Paper
Allied Chemical and Energy Local 140, which represents about 90
paper makers. ''If it wasn't a profitable mill and it wasn't
technologically advanced, it wouldn't be considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Some employees were less enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of people are very uncomfortable,'' said Timothy
Barnard, president of PACE Local 387, representing about 350
maintenance, yard and converting employees.
</P>
<P>
   Local 387 Vice President Randolph Holloway said he doesn't know
what the result will be. ''We don't even know who they (the buyers)
are,'' he said. ''If they're going to tell us we're on the trading
block, they ought to tell us who it is.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia-Pacific's mill here will likely be sold in a divestiture
aimed at smoothing the way for an $11 billion acquisition of Fort
James Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A potential buyer has expressed an interest, and negotiations
are under way, according to the local plant's communications
manager, Marta Pauer-Tursi.
</P>
<P>
   The sale is to be a package deal, she added. The buyer would
also purchase Georgia-Pacific's mills in Greenwich; Brattleboro,
Vt.; Gary, Ind.; Flagstaff, Ariz.; suburban Chicago; and LaGrange,
Ga.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Heads Urge Suu Kyi To Leave  </HEADLINE>
By VIJAY JOSHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) -- Myanmar's military government on
Saturday urged pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi to end a
three-day roadside standoff with security forces and signaled that
it may force her to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's car has been blocked by police outside the capital,
Yangon, since Thursday, when she and 12 members of her National
League for Democracy political party tried to drive out to the
countryside for party organizational work.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time in two years that Suu Kyi had tried to
leave Yangon. The swift security action she provoked indicated that
the military government, which has ruled Myanmar with an iron fist
since 1988, is in no mood to allow any opposition activity.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi has refused to go back to the capital and has spent the
last two nights in the car in the suburb of Dala. It appeared she
was ready to spend a third night there.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi and her companions ''remain free to return to their
homes at any time, or to continue staying by the road side as long
as the conditions remain safe,'' said a government statement
released Saturday in Yangon. The statement indicated that the
government was keeping open the option of sending her back to
Yangon forcibly, using her safety as a pretext.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi tried to leave Yangon four times in 1998 but was stopped
every time. On one occasion, she remained in her car for nearly six
days and on another for 13 days.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the London-based Amnesty International urged the
government to let Suu Kyi travel unhindered.
</P>
<P>
   Restricting Suu Kyi's movements is another example of the
military's attempts to stamp out ''all peaceful opposition
activities'' in Myanmar, also known as Burma, Donna Guest of
Amnesty said in a statement. Similar protests were leveled Friday
by the United States and Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi's car and a pickup carrying her party supporters have
been herded into a small lane, which has been blocked by two trucks
on both ends, witnesses said. A letter written by her party's
chairman said the tires on both vehicles were deflated.
</P>
<P>
   The government statement said Suu Kyi was not allowed to go
further because security conditions make it unsafe for her to
travel outside Yangon. It said the government ''encourages'' her to
return home and continue ''her political activities in a more
secure environment in Yangon.''
</P>
<P>
   Reporters were stopped by security forces at the ferry crossing
point on the Yangon river which separates Yangon from Dala. They
were politely told to go back.
</P>
<P>
   Suu Kyi has been at loggerheads with the military government
since 1988, when she helped lead a pro-democracy uprising. It was
brutally crushed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   She was put under house arrest in 1989. The order was lifted in
1995, but her movements have remained restricted. The government
refuses to honor the results of the 1990 general elections, which
her party won by a landslide.

<HEADLINE> Explosives Found in England Woods  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A cache of sophisticated explosives has been found
in a rural wooded area in southern England, police said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The devices were discovered by a man walking his dog in the
woods in Oxfordshire on Friday afternoon, police said. ''These
devices are, in the opinion of our experts, extremely sophisticated
and extremely dangerous,'' said Detective Superintendent John
Donlon.
</P>
<P>
   Police found eight handmade explosive devices buried at the site
70 miles west of London. The clear plastic water bottles were
filled with seven pounds of brass nuts and were designed to explode
if disturbed or handled, Donlon said.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-terrorist officers and an army bomb-disposal squad were
called to the scene, and some of the devices were taken away for
forensic examination.
</P>
<P>
   The explosives were similar to one found on a wall in
Cheltenham, western England, on Aug. 20, Donlon said. He said no
group had claimed responsibility for the devices.

<HEADLINE> Man Arrested for Brazil Terror Plan  </HEADLINE>
By MARCELO BALLVE
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Police in Brazil have arrested a
former army paratrooper who says he was forming a revolutionary
group to carry out robberies and stockpile arms in a bid to
overthrow the government.
</P>
<P>
   Nelson Farias Marinho, a 57-year-old taxi driver, was arrested
late Friday at his home in Rio for leading an attack on a police
station.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking from a jail cell, Marinho admitted to reporters
Saturday that he led the raid to obtain weapons. He said his group
was recruiting members for bank robberies to finance his Socialist
Faction for National Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they found instructional videotapes on guerrilla
tactics at his home as well as three pistols, including one
allegedly stolen from the police station during the attack.
</P>
<P>
   ''He said he wanted to start small and then start a revolution
against the government,'' said police officer Sergio Nascimento.
''He said that the politicians were selling Brazil out to
foreigners, that everyday the people were getting poorer and the
politicians were getting richer.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Marinho and 11 men in camouflage with machine guns
marched through the streets of a small town and then stormed into
the police station in Carapebus, 125 miles northeast of Rio. They
exchanged shots with four officers before stealing a cache of
handguns and fleeing, said police Maj. Jose Luiz Mallmann. One
officer was wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Police said seven other men suspected in the attack were also
arrested Friday in rural areas northeast of Rio and taken with
Marinho to a jail in Macae, 16 miles east of Carapebus.
</P>
<P>
   The four remaining men are still at large, police said. All the
men arrested will be charged with attempted homicide and robbery.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil's last major insurgent group, the Araguaia Guerrillas,
were active during the 1970s in northern Brazil, but were wiped out
by the military in 1974.

<HEADLINE> Martin Luther King Jr.'s son tries to further his father's 'dream'  </HEADLINE>
By DAVID HO
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) - Thirty-seven years later, the son of Martin
Luther King Jr. stood where his father stood and repeated his
father's challenge to the conscience of America: ''I dare you to
fulfill the dream.''
</P>
<P>
   This time it was a new grievance that brought tens of thousands
to the foot of the Lincoln Memorial on Saturday. This time racial
profiling and police brutality were laid before the country as the
enflaming issues.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering replicated the 1963 March on Washington, which
brought more than a quarter-million protesters to demand that the
government take note of the mistreatment of blacks at a time when
many were denied the right to vote.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., on the program as a secondary
speaker, electrified the moment with his ''I have a dream'' speech.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Luther King III, like his father, received second
billing, this time to the Rev. Al Sharpton, the New York City civil
rights activist.
</P>
<P>
   ''The day my father dreamed about has not yet been realized in
our lending institutions, nor in our employment offices, nor even
in our nation's courtrooms,'' said King. He asked President Clinton
to issue an executive order outlawing racial profiling, the
practice of stopping and questioning people on the basis of race.
</P>
<P>
   ''A black man can walk over a bridge, but he cannot drive over
it without being stopped,'' King told a cheering crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton challenged Vice President Al Gore and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush to pledge their support.
</P>
<P>
   ''Both of you are running for president, but you can't run from
us,'' he said. ''If you want us, you have to come to us and address
our concerns.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton said he and King had chosen the 37th anniversary of the
elder King's speech because of the millennial election year and the
need for immediate action. Sharpton said he would consider the
event a success if the White House and Congress were motivated to
outlaw racial profiling and combat police brutality.
</P>
<P>
   Organizers for the ''Redeem the Dream'' event estimated the
turnout at 100,000, but they had a permit for up to 30,000 people
on the National Mall.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd in front of the Lincoln Memorial sprawled down either
side of the 440-yard-long reflecting pool for about half of its
length toward the Washington Monument.
</P>
<P>
   Many people at the event held banners and signs and struggled to
hear the speakers over the roar of low-flying planes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are tired of walking while black, getting arrested for
breathing while black and living while black,'' said NAACP
President Kweisi Mfume. ''We want equal justice.
</P>
<P>
   ''No justice, no peace!'' Mfume concluded to cheers and
applause.
</P>
<P>
   Victims of police brutality addressed the crowd, including Abner
Louima, a Haitian immigrant who in 1997 was brutalized with a
broken broomstick in a New York police station.
</P>
<P>
   ''We (are) tired of being judged for our skin color. We want to
be judged for our hearts only,'' Louima said, adding that elected
officials become blind to racial problems once they're in office.
</P>
<P>
   Also speaking were Kadiatou and Saikou Diallo, parents of Amadou
Diallo, an immigrant from Guinea in West Africa. He was shot 19
times in 1999 in the vestibule of his apartment building by New
York police officers who said they feared he was reaching for a
gun. The only object found was his wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Coretta Scott King, wife of the slain leader, and other
principals from the 1963 march also spoke.
</P>
<P>
   While people came from around the country to the event, most of
them arrived on buses from towns and cities along the East Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Vicki Hubbard, 47, a music teacher from Lynchburg, Va., came
with her church group to hear her pastor speak at the event.
</P>
<P>
   ''Most of us were either too young or not even born when they
held the first march,'' she said. ''We wanted to come and be part
of the cause and part of history.''
</P>
<P>
   King reminded the crowd that his father's dream was that his
children would be judged not by the color of their skin but by the
content of their character.
</P>
<P>
   ''As one of those four little children,'' he said, ''I must

<HEADLINE> Pakistan General: No Early Election  </HEADLINE>
By AMIR ZIA
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) -- Military ruler Gen. Pervez Musharraf
won't bow to demands for an early return to democracy, but will
abide by the Supreme Court's three-year deadline for elections,
Pakistan's Foreign Ministry said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Musharraf met with Commonwealth Secretary-General Don McKinnon,
who said Friday on his arrival in Islamabad that his group would
like to see elections in Pakistan ''earlier rather than later.''
The Commonwealth is an organization of Britain and its former
colonies.
</P>
<P>
   During his meeting with McKinnon, Musharraf reviewed his
government's plans to revive Pakistan's ailing economy and
implement political reforms, a Foreign Ministry statement said.
Musharraf promised to complete the reforms within the Supreme
Court-imposed deadline of three years, but no sooner, the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
   Also Saturday, McKinnon met Pakistani President Rafiq Tarrar and
Foreign Minister Abdul Sattar. During meetings with Pakistan's
leaders, McKinnon discussed the problem of corruption in emerging
democracies, the Foreign Ministry statement said without
elaborating.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, McKinnon will meet with leaders of political parties
and representatives of human rights groups.
</P>
<P>
   The Commonwealth suspended Pakistan's membership soon after the
military coup that ousted the country's elected government last
October. Since then, it has pressed the military-led government to
relinquish power and pave the way for the country's return to
democracy.
</P>
<P>
   But there is little domestic pressure on Musharraf for elections
in a country which has been ruled by the army for 25 years of its
53-year history. Musharraf accuses deposed premier Nawaz Sharif's
government of relentless corruption, destroying institutions,
undermining the constitution and responsibility for the country's
economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   He has formed the National Accountability Bureau and set up
special courts with sweeping powers to arrest, investigate and try
politicians, bureaucrats and businessmen accused of graft.

<HEADLINE> New Mad Cow Cases Found in France  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Two new cases of so-called mad cow disease have
been discovered in northwestern France, local officials said,
raising the total number of cases detected in the country this year
to 40.
</P>
<P>
   The two animals found to be infected were born in 1994 and 1995.
French law requires that the animals and the herds they belong to
be slaughtered and incinerated.
</P>
<P>
   French authorities last year discovered 31 cases of mad cow
disease, or bovine spongiform encephalopathy. The disease is
believed to cause a similar brain-wasting ailment in humans known
as Creutzfeld-Jacob disease.
</P>
<P>
   New cases of the disease are expected to break out in France
until 2002, five years after authorities took rigorous measures to
prevent more outbreaks. The disease has an average incubation
period of five years.

<HEADLINE> One Dead in S.D. Train Derailment  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKINGS, S.D. (AP) -- A train carrying corn through South
Dakota derailed Saturday, killing one crew member and injuring
another.
</P>
<P>
   The Dakota, Minnesota and Eastern Railroad said someone
deliberately caused the derailment. Kevin Schieffer, president of
the railroad, called it a ''cold-blooded'' action. He said a
composite drawing was made of someone seen leaving the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Schieffer said the westbound train was diverted to a side track
where it struck eight parked cars loaded with soybeans.
</P>
<P>
   He said rail switches had been checked after an eastbound train
passed through the area about 90 minutes earlier, and the switches
were all in order at that time.
</P>
<P>
   The derailment occurred between two intersections in Brookings,
a city of about 16,000 in eastern South Dakota.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was chaotic, with locomotives pointing in the air,
rail cars tangled up and corn spilled, Schieffer said.
</P>
<P>
   The 55-car train was on its way to central South Dakota to hook
up with other cars for shipment to western export markets.

<HEADLINE> OAS Mission: Haiti Intolerance Wide  </HEADLINE>
By MICHAEL NORTON
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) -- An Organization of American States
human rights commission wound up a five-day visit to Haiti by
warning of an alarming rise in political intolerance in the
Caribbean nation.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS fact-finding mission met with government officials,
political leaders and human rights groups. It found that ''the
climate of intimidation has intensified in the country,'' Elio
Bigodo, president of the OAS's Inter-American Commission on Human
Rights, said Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Fifteen people died in politically related attacks in the months
leading up to May 21 local and legislative elections, and
rock-throwing street demonstrators loyal to former President
Jean-Bertrand Aristide managed to shut down the capital on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested at least 40 opposition politicians and militants
after the balloting.
</P>
<P>
   Aristide's Lavalas Family party went on to win 18 of 19 seats in
the upper house of Parliament and 72 of 82 seats in the lower house
in a landslide victory the opposition claimed was fraudulent.
Former electoral council president Leon Manus fled to the United
States in June, fearing for his life after he refused to approve
the first-round Senate results.
</P>
<P>
   The OAS had found the balloting acceptable but contested the
method used to compute some winners. It said 10 of the Senate seats
should have gone to a run-off vote.

<HEADLINE> Residents Kidnap Mexican Officials  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALTAMIRANO, Mexico (AP) -- Hundreds of residents of a largely
Indian village in southern Mexico kidnapped two officials, their
secretaries and eight others on Friday to demand $100,000 to build
a much-needed road.
</P>
<P>
   The kidnapping at the local district attorney's office came
shortly after a road commission rejected a request for a rural road
in Chiapas state. Assistant District Attorney Mariano Lopez Perez
was trying to negotiate the captives' release late Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Such actions are common in impoverished Chiapas, where Zapatista
rebels led an uprising in 1994 to demand greater Indian rights. A
partial accord was signed in 1996, but peace talks later broke
down. The Zapatistas have refused to resume negotiations, claiming
the government has failed to abide by the 1996 agreement.

<HEADLINE> Nun Slams India Anti-Christian Acts  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALCUTTA, India (AP) -- Mother Teresa's successor slammed attacks
against Christians in India as hundreds of nuns and children prayed
at the late nun's marbled tomb on Saturday, her 90th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ''The atrocities on the Christians (are) a disgrace for our
country, which is a secular state,'' Sister Nirmala said in her
address at the headquarters of Missionaries of Charity, the
international order founded by Mother Teresa. ''Our brothers and
sisters of the Hindu religion are known for their tolerance of
other religions in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of attacks on Indian Christians over
the last two years. Church leaders accuse right-wing allies of
Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party of
being involved in the assaults.
</P>
<P>
   The government says it has investigated the attacks, and that
many of them were related to local land and property disputes.
Arrests have been made in several other cases, Interior Ministry
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   Mother Teresa, born in the former Yugoslavia, died Sept. 6, 1997
at the age of 87. Her white marble tomb was built at the
Motherhouse, the headquarters of the order in Calcutta.
</P>
<P>
   Hundreds of nuns and children holding flowers took part in a
series of prayer meetings at Missionaries of Charity centers in
Calcutta, the city Mother Teresa adopted as her own.

<HEADLINE> French Suspect Stages Spain Escape  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MADRID, Spain (AP) -- A suspected French mafioso facing murder
charges in Spain staged a spectacular escape from police custody
during a trip to a Madrid hospital, newspapers said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Frigerio, a 37-year-old native of Marseille, was in the
hospital for a checkup Friday when two armed cohorts attacked his
police guards, spraying them with an aerosol irritant and beating
them with pistol butts.
</P>
<P>
   They then took off with the handcuffed Frigerio. Running through
corridors, they ran down the stairs to a side exit, where another
accomplice was waiting with a getaway car.
</P>
<P>
   The fight with police and the mad dash through the hospital
terrified patients, doctors and visitors, some of whom threw
themselves to the floor fearing a gun battle, El Pais newspaper
said.
</P>
<P>
   Frigerio was awaiting trial for allegedly killing two Frenchmen
in June of last year in the southern Spanish town of Mijas. El Pais
said Frigerio is accused of shooting one of the two men 17 times.
Police say the killing was a settling of scores between rival crime
gangs.
</P>
<P>
   France has requested Frigerio's extradition because he was
sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison in 1998, security
sources in France said. He had been convicted of drug trafficking
and criminal conspiracy.

<HEADLINE> Express Tour Wins Stallion Stakes  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI (AP) -- Express Tour breezed to victory in the Affirmed
Division of the $125,000 Florida Stallion Stakes at Calder Race
Course on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Silk Concorde was the runaway winner of the Susan's Girl
Division for fillies. Both events were the second legs of the
three-race series for 2-year olds.
</P>
<P>
   Florida-bred Express Tour, ridden by Julio Garcia, won the
Affirmed by 11&AMP;frac14; lengths over Radical Riley, a 70-1 shot, with Sir
Brian's Sword third in the seven-furlong race.
</P>
<P>
   Express Tour was timed in 1:23 4-5 and Silk Concorde in 1:23
2-5, in each case a stakes record. Express Tour paid $6.40, $4.40,
and $2.60; Radical Riley $36 and $10.60; and Sir Brian's Sword
$3.60.
</P>
<P>
   In the Susan's Girl, Silk Concorde, with Javier Castellon
aboard, finished ahead of stablemate Valid Forbes by 5&AMP;frac34; lengths.
Dream Me was third in the seven-furlong race.
</P>
<P>
   Silk Concorde paid $3.80, $2.10, and $2.10.; Valid Forbes $2.10
and $2.10; and Dream Me also paid $2.10.
</P>
<P>
   Express Tour is in position to earn $290,000 if he can win the
final phase of the Stallion Stakes series-- the In-Reality Division
at a 1 1-16 miles on Oct. 7. Having won the six- and seven-furlong
phases of the series, Express Tour is eligible for a $50,000 bonus
in addition to the $240,000 winner's purse in the Dr. Fager finale.
</P>
<P>
   Express Tour was crowded at the start and was fifth as Condensed
Version went to the front. Express Tour moved up quickly and took
the lead on the rail leaving the seven-furlong chute.
</P>
<P>
   Condensed Version stayed within a length of Express Tour to the
stretch turn. From that point, it was a one-horse race. Radical
Riley rallied on the outside for second, 1&AMP;frac14; lengths ahead of Sir
Brian's Sword.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the My Dear Girl division for fillies will win
just $240,000 because Silk Concorde finished second to Valid Forbes
in the six-furlong filly series opener.
</P>
<P>
   Silk Concorde, the daughter of Concorde's Tune, was second to
Who's Tune, three lengths off the pace, at the five-eighths pole.
She cut the deficit to a half-length going into the far turn.
</P>
<P>
   At the quarter pole, Silk Concorde had a length lead over Dream
Me before she opened a huge lead in midstretch and was not
threatened by Vaild Forbes' late run.

<HEADLINE> Webb Breaks Own 54-Hole LPGA Record  </HEADLINE>
By HARRY ATKINS
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. (AP) -- Karrie Webb, with nothing left to
prove, has her sights on LPGA Tour records.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian star, already the No. 1 female player in the
world and widely considered the LPGA's answer to Tiger Woods,
continued her assault on the tour's record book Saturday, breaking
her own mark for 54 holes in the Oldsmobile Classic.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, who matched the LPGA's single-round record Friday with an
11-under-par 61, followed that with a 66 for a 193 total on the
Walnut Hills course. Her 23-under total broke the record of 22
under that Webb set last year in the Australian Ladies Masters.
</P>
<P>
   Cristie Kerr and Meg Mallon were tied for second at 201, eight
strokes behind Webb. Kerr shot a 65, and Mallon, playing with Webb,
had a 71.
</P>
<P>
   And more records are almost certain to fall.
</P>
<P>
   The LPGA record for 72 holes is 26-under 262, also by Webb in
the 1999 Australian Ladies Masters.
</P>
<P>
   ''Hopefully, I can play solid tomorrow,'' said Webb, who has
five tour victories this season, including two majors. ''I can take
a shot at the record. But, I don't want to get too far ahead of
myself. I don't want to do anything stupid.''
</P>
<P>
   Lisa Walters set the Oldsmobile Classic record of 23 under in
1998. Webb's play has been so superior that she has tied that with
18 holes left to play.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's fun to see someone play that well,'' said Mallon, who
applauded along with the fans when Webb rolled in a 6-foot putt for
birdie on the final hole.
</P>
<P>
   Mallon, whose course-record of 10 under in the first round on
the 6,241-yard layout lasted only one day, started the day three
strokes behind Webb.
</P>
<P>
   But not for long.
</P>
<P>
   Webb, striking the ball as well as she ever has, birdied three
of the first four holes and was clearly on her way. Only the fact
that she bogeyed Nos. 5 and 15 kept Webb from widening her lead any
more than she did.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the thing that made the bogey at No. 5 noteworthy was
that it was so unexpected. Her second shot on the 511-yard hole
landed in a slight divot and Webb couldn't pitch it out cleanly.
</P>
<P>
   The ball landed 20 yards short of the green, and her chip ran 30
feet past the hole.
</P>
<P>
   ''That was a little careless, a little untiddy,'' Webb said.
''But I came right back with birdies after both of my bogies
today.''
</P>
<P>
   Webb drove into a bunker on the right side of the fairway on the
397-yard 15th. Her shot from the sand was just short of the green.
Webb chipped within 12 feet, but couldn't get the saving putt to
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Webb has held a final-round lead 20 times and gone on to win 12
of those tournaments. She finished second seven times and tied for
seventh once.
</P>
<P>
   Even Mallon, who has an impressive record of comeback wins,
conceded that this match was just about over.
</P>
<P>
   ''Yeah, I've had some runs, but I can't remember overcoming an
eight-shot lead,'' Mallon said.

<HEADLINE> Pipeline Explosion Victims Mourned  </HEADLINE>
By MARY PEREA
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARLSBAD, N.M. (AP) -- Friends and family wept openly as they
filed past seven caskets adorned with flowers and graced by
pictures of the 11 people killed in one of the nation's deadliest
pipeline explosions.
</P>
<P>
   About 400 mourners gathered for a memorial at the Walter
Gerrells Civic Center auditorium Saturday for the members of two
extended families who were camping a week ago when the nearby
pipeline exploded.
</P>
<P>
   These deaths ''shook the country,'' said the Rev. D. Michael Lee
of Victory Baptist Church. ''It's sad that it takes a tragedy like
this to bring the community together.''
</P>
<P>
   The family members were killed when a pipeline owned by El Paso
Energy Co. blew up along the Pecos River south of Carlsbad last
weekend. The blast sent a 350-foot high fireball into the sky and
billows of flame into the nearby campsite.
</P>
<P>
   The 12th victim, Amanda Smith, 25, of Carlsbad, remained in
critical condition Saturday at a hospital in Lubbock, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Killed in the blast were her husband, Terry, 23; his 3-year-old
son, Dustin; her parents, Don Sumler and Glenda Sumler, 47, of
Loving; and Kirsten Sumler, 5, Amanda Smith's daughter. Also killed
were Roy Lee Heady, 20, and his wife Amy, 18, of Artesia, and their
three daughters, 22-month-old Kelsey and 6-month-old twins Timber
and Tamber.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Smith, 43, of Carlsbad, Terry's father, died two days
after the blast.
</P>
<P>
   Amy Heady was laid in a casket with her twins, and her husband,
Roy, was in the same casket with their daughter, Kelsey. Terry
Smith was laid with his son Dustin.
</P>
<P>
   Rev. Ed Kneeland of the Church of the Nazarene asked the family
to take comfort in their faith. ''The Lord is close to the broken
hearted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Many mourners sobbed loudly during a television montage of
family photos accompanied by the song ''Wind Beneath My Wings.''
</P>
<P>
   ''It was such a tragedy,'' Mara Anaya, a friend of Amy Heady,
said.
</P>
<P>
   Anaya's mother, Maria Marquez Anaya, said the accident has
touched everyone in the community.
</P>
<P>
   ''It has definitely opened people's eyes. The community is more
aware of the dangers of pipelines,'' Marquez Anaya said. ''There
should be more inspections, especially in an area where there's so
much gas.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, National Transportation Safety Board
chairman Jim Hall toured the blast site and afterwards urged the
oil and gas industry to support stricter safety standards for
pipelines. A preliminary investigation found corrosion in the part
of the pipe that blew up.

<HEADLINE> Judge Orders Siamese Separation  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON (AP) -- A British judge has ruled that a two-week-old
Siamese twin should be separated from her sister, even though she
will die in the process -- and despite the opposition of the babies'
parents.
</P>
<P>
   High Court judge Robert Johnson authorized the separation of the
twins on Friday. A lawyer representing the weaker twin, known
publicly as Mary, is considering whether to appeal the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   Mary and Jodie -- not their real names -- were born joined at the
lower abdomen on Aug. 8 in Manchester, northern England. If they
are separated, Mary will die. But without the surgery both twins
are likely to perish.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was supported by the babies' hospital but opposed
by the parents, who cannot be identified for legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   In written evidence to the court, the parents said: ''We cannot
begin to accept or contemplate that one of our children should die
to enable the other one to survive. That is not God's will.
</P>
<P>
   ''Everyone has the right to life, so why should we kill one of
our daughters to enable the other one to survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Official Solicitor H.J. Baker, who represents minors or adults
under legal disability in court proceedings in England and Wales,
was considering an appeal on behalf of the doomed twin, his office
said in a statement. A decision was expected early in the week.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is a tragic and complex case,'' the statement said.

   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) --President Clinton appealed to the leaders of this
oil-rich nation Saturday to set aside political acrimony so that their citizens
can lift themselves from poverty and isolation. Standing in the cavernous
National Assembly chamber, Clinton praised President Olusegun Obasanjo's
leadership in stabilizing Nigeria, and told lawmakers they must develop a better
working relationship if their nation is to surmount ''the wrongs and errors of
the past.'' Obasanjo won office last year after death removed Nigeria's

Gore, gaining in the polls since his mid-August nominating convention, announced
plans for a weeklong focus on health care where aides contend Bush is vulnerable
because of ''a fundamental difference'' between the two. Seeking to counter
that, Bush has begun airing a campaign commercial touting his own health care
plan, while the Republican National Committee on Monday plans to launch a $7

Jr. stood where his father stood and repeated his father's challenge to the
conscience of America: ''I dare you to fulfill the dream.'' This time it was a
new grievance that brought tens of thousands to the foot of the Lincoln
Memorial. This time racial profiling and police brutality were laid before the
country as the enflaming issues. The gathering replicated the 1963 March on
Washington, which brought more than a quarter-million protesters to demand that
the government take note of the mistreatment of blacks at a time when many were
denied the right to vote.

Volcano Threat Creates Japan Exodus
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   TOKYO (AP) -- Two hundred residents boarded boats and fled a small island
south of Tokyo on Saturday -- the latest exodus amid fears that a ''fairly big''
eruption could spout from a reawakened volcano, a local official said. With
Saturday's departures, almost one-third of Miyake island's 3,850 residents have
left for other parts of Japan since Aug. 19, said local official Takashi
Hasegawa. The exodus began a day after Mount Oyama threw up a five-mile column
of ash mixed with volcanic rock on Aug. 18. It was the biggest eruption since
the 2,686-foot volcano rumbled back to life on July 9.

   HOUSTON (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes scored 31 points and Cynthia Cooper had 25 in
her final game as the Houston Comets rallied to beat the New York Liberty 79-73
in overtime today for their fourth straight WNBA championship. Swoopes, the
league's MVP and leading scorer this season, and three-time scoring champion
Cooper took charge of the game in the second half. They combined for 32 of the
Comets' final 36 points. Cooper, who said she'd retire after the playoffs, hit a
3-pointer with 21 seconds to play that tied the game at 64-64 and forced
overtime. Swoopes' 31 points set a career playoff high.

Clinton Lauds Nigeria Democracy
</SUBHEAD>

   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) --President Clinton asked leaders of this oil-rich nation
Saturday to set aside political acrimony so that their citizens can lift
themselves from poverty and isolation. Clinton praised President Olusegun
Obasanjo's leadership in stabilizing Nigeria, standing in the cavernous National
Assembly chamber, and told lawmakers they must develop a better working
relationship if their nation is to surmount ''the wrongs and errors of the
past.'' Obasanjo won office last year after death removed Nigeria's dictator,
Gen. Sani Abacha, from power and led to a quick turn to democracy.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Raid Islamic Town  </HEADLINE>
By MOHAMMED DARAGHMEH
<TEXT>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- Hundreds of Israeli troops raided an
Islamic militant stronghold Saturday, and an Arabic TV station
quoted witnesses as saying three Israeli soldiers were killed.
</P>
<P>
   Nine Israeli soldiers and several Palestinians were injured in
the fighting in the West Bank, said Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV. The
Israeli army declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Repeated bursts of gunfire were heard in the village of Assira
Ashamalieh late Saturday, residents told The Associated Press by
telephone. Troops sealed the village, a stronghold of the Islamic
militant group Hamas, and imposed a curfew, with hundreds of
soldiers patrolling the streets and conducting house-to-house
searches, the witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   Two helicopters trained bright spotlights on the homes and
surrounding fields, witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   It was not immediately clear why the army raided the village,
which is home to Mahmoud Abu Hanoud, the top Hamas fugitive in the
West Bank. Abu Hanoud is believed to be the mastermind of two 1997
suicide bombings in Jerusalem that left 43 people dead, including
five assailants.
</P>
<P>
   The raid comes at a time of deadlock in Israeli-Palestinian
peace talks, with both sides saying it is unlikely they can meet a
Sept. 13 deadline for a treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Israeli troops botched a raid on another
West Bank village, killing an elderly Palestinian-American who
opened fire after mistaking the soldiers for burglars.
</P>
<P>
   The raid on Assira Ashamalieh began at about 10 p.m. local time,
witnesses said.
</P>
<P>
   The helicopters trained spotlights on the fields between the
village and the nearby Palestinian town of Nablus in an apparent
hunt for fugitives. One resident, Nidal Daglas, said he was
standing on the roof of his home when he heard intensive gunfire.
</P>
<P>
   ''I didn't know what was going on. I went downstairs, and when I
was near the entrance of my home, I was hit in the leg by a
bullet,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Daglas said soldiers initially refused to let ambulances into
the village, but that he eventually received medical treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Hanoud's sister-in-law, Riham, said troops did not come to
her home. A Hamas leader in the Gaza Strip, Mahmoud Zahar, said he
did not know whether Abu Hanoud had been captured.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, hundreds of residents rushed into the streets
despite the curfew. They burned several tires and chanted: ''With
our spirit and our blood, we will redeem you, Abu Hanoud.''
</P>
<P>
   Assira Ashamalieh is under joint Israeli-Palestinian control,
while Nablus is under full Palestinian jurisdiction, meaning those
seeking refuge there are out of the reach of the Israeli security
forces.

<HEADLINE> Little League W.S. Roundup  </HEADLINE>
By JOHN WAWROW
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- The Little Leaguers from Maracaibo,
Venezuela, arrived with only one bat, but departed with the World
Series title after beating Bellaire, Texas, 3-2 on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ruben Mavarez pitched a four-hitter, struck out six and also
doubled and scored as Venezuela claimed its second World Series
championship in six years and fifth overall for Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Chourio singled and scored for Maracaibo, while Mavarez
picked up his second win of the week.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire pitcher Alex Atherton threw a two-hitter, but was
undone by two wild pitches and an error, which led to all three
Maracaibo runs.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire missed a chance in the bottom of the sixth when
Atherton singled and Nick Wills hit a two-out single, advancing
Atherton to third.
</P>
<P>
   With the crowd of 42,000 on its feet, Mavarez ended the game --
and threw up his glove in the air -- by striking out Hunter
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   With Mavarez kneeling on the mound, the team came charging and
piled up on top of him. Left fielder Marcel Prado came out carrying
a Venezuelan flag, while the Bellaire players sat and watched in
the dugout.
</P>
<P>
   The team from Sierra Maestra hails from a poorer part of
Maracaibo and had four players begin tournament play without
spikes.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, they'll now earn a trip to the capitol and a
meeting with the president. Not bad for a team whose flight from
Venezuela had to turn back because of mechanical problems, and lost
its Series opener 10-0 to Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The win was the 28th by international representatives, versus 26
won by U.S. teams.
</P>
<P>
   Toms River, N.J. was the last U.S. team to win, beating Kashima,
Japan, in 1998. Okasa won last year.
</P>
<P>
   Two Texas teams have won the championship, the last being
Westbury American-Houston, in 1966.
</P>
<P>
   Sierra Maestra-Maracaibo is the ninth Venezuelan team to reach
the Series, and second to claim the title after
Coquivacoa-Maracaibo won it all in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo never trailed after going up 2-0 in the first inning
when Atherton loaded the bases and then threw two consecutive wild
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   There was some controversy on Bellaire's first run as Michael
Johnson tripled down the third-base line, only to have umpire Andy
Konyar initially call it foul, but quickly change it to fair.
Because of Konyar's initial call, Maracaibo left fielder Marcel
Prado did not immediately charge after the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Atherton then drove Johnson in with a double.
</P>
<P>
   Maracaibo went up 3-1 in the third when right fielder Drew
Zizinia misplayed Manuel Castellano's fly ball, allowing Mavarez to
score from second.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire cut the lead to 3-2 in the third when Mitchell Malone
scored on Mavarez's wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier Saturday, actor Kevin Costner, NBA players' union
executive director Billy Hunter and groundbreaking transplant
surgeon Dr. Robert Stratta -- all former Little Leaguers -- were
enshrined in the Little League Hall of Excellence.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baseball, Little League, was such a huge part of my life as a
kid and now as a father,'' said Costner, who played Little League
in Ventura, Calif. ''The memories are, in fact, so thick, that I
have to brush them away from my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Prior to the game, Hall of Famer George Brett was awarded the
Bill Shea Distinguished Little League Graduate Award, which
recognizes former Little Leaguers who have attained respected
public status.
</P>
<P>
   Friday night, Republican Presidential candidate and Texas
Governor George W. Bush sent the Bellaire team a letter
congratulating them on reaching the final.
</P>
<P>
   ''Determination and teamwork represent the spirit of Texas. I
commend you for your hard work and dedication,'' Bush wrote. ''You
make the Bellaire community and the Lone Star State proud.''

<HEADLINE> Algerian Government Resigns  </HEADLINE>
By HASSANE MEFTAHI
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) -- Wrestling to end a civil insurgency that
has killed thousands of people, Algerian President Abdelaziz
Bouteflika faced a new challenge Saturday when his 8-month-old
government resigned.
</P>
<P>
   The president accepted the collective resignation of his Cabinet
after meeting with Prime Minister Ahmed Benbitour in the morning.
He immediately charged close aide Ali Benflis with forming a new
government, and later Saturday Benflis unveiled his new Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
   The new lineup remains largely unchanged from the previous
administration -- with one significant exception. Abdelaziz
Belkhadem, an ex-president of the National Assembly who has long
symbolized the conservative elements of the formerly ruling
National Liberation Front party, will succeed Foreign Affairs
Minister Youcef Yousfi.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for the old Cabinet's resignation were not
immediately clear.
</P>
<P>
   Benbitour, who has been prime minister since December 1999, had
formed his government by tapping into five different political
parties. It was apparently an effort to unify the government behind
Bouteflika's efforts to end the bloody struggle here by Islamic
militants.
</P>
<P>
   Algeria has been torn apart by violence since the army canceled
1992 legislative elections that a Muslim fundamentalist party, the
Islamic Salvation Front, was strongly favored to win. Approximately
1,300 people have died in the past seven months, and more than
100,000 have been killed since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bouteflika has sought to restore peace by offering a partial
amnesty to militants not guilty of serious crimes. Violence
continues, however, with almost daily reports of deaths of
civilians, soldiers and militants.
</P>
<P>
   The coalition government not only failed to stem the violence
and but also fell short of achieving the cohesion necessary to
enact education, judicial and bureaucratic reforms that Bouteflika
has been touting since his April 1999 election.
</P>
<P>
   The most irritable coalition partner appeared to be the Movement
for a Peaceful Society, or MPS, a moderate Islamic party that had
repeatedly criticized Bouteflika's politics in public.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, Bouteflika fired 13 local officials as part
of a larger shake-up of the Algerian administration. A statement
from the presidency had said the decision to fire the officials and
promote several others aimed to ''breathe new life into the
administration.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of those fired had faced harsh criticism in the media
during the past few weeks for poor management of land and housing.
Many were implicated by the press in various scandals.

<HEADLINE> Phillies 5, Giants 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Scott Rolen hit a two-run triple and Pat
Burrell had a two-run double as the Philadelphia Phillies beat the
San Francisco Giants for the first time in 10 tries, 5-2 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Phillies' first victory over the Giants since June 2,
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Randy Wolf (10-7) won for the first time in five starts.
Philadelphia has won just 12 of its last 37 games.
</P>
<P>
   Rolen went 2-for-4 and raised his club-high RBI total to 71.
Burrell had a two-run double for the Phillies, who scored all five
of their runs with two outs.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf threw 135 pitches in six innings. He gave up two runs on
eight hits and struck out seven.
</P>
<P>
   Vicente Padilla pitched two hitless innings. Jeff Brantley got
the final three outs for his 20th save in 24 opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   Phillies pitchers retired the final 12 Giants batters.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia pushed across three runs to take a 3-0 lead in the
third inning off Kirk Rueter (8-9). With two outs, Burrell hit a
two-run double and Brian Hunter looped an RBI single.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants cut the deficit to 3-1 in the fourth on Barry Bonds'
sacrifice fly.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia came back with two runs in its half of the fourth
to make the score 5-1. Rolen's liner was played into a two-run
triple when right fielder Ellis Burks lost the ball in the
sunlight.
</P>
<P>
   Calvin Murray's RBI double pulled the Giants within 5-2 in the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Rueter failed to pitch past the fifth inning for his third
straight start. He worked four innings, allowing five runs on 10
hits.
Notes: Philadelphia's Bobby Abreu recorded his 12th outfield
assist, one behind Florida's Mark Kotsay and Pittsburgh's Brian
Giles, the NL leaders. ... Burrell's 58 RBIs are tops for NL
rookies. He has also struck out 106 times in 291 at-bats... Rueter
fell to 3-1 lifetime against Philadelphia in 12 career starts. ...
Wolf was 0-6 with a 7.83 ERA in 10 career starts in August before
Saturday. ... Murray tied a career-high with three hits.

<HEADLINE> Leaf Back as Chargers' Starting QB  </HEADLINE>
By BERNIE WILSON
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO (AP) -- Are you ready for some more Ryan Leaf?
</P>
<P>
   Leaf, who has been rehabilitating his bad-boy image along with
his surgically repaired right shoulder, on Saturday regained the
San Diego Chargers' starting quarterback job that he lost during
his tumultuous rookie season of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm happy. I feel very fortunate that I'm getting the
opportunity,'' said Leaf, who has been doing and saying all the
right things this summer. ''For me, it's just a wonderful
opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   When last seen in the regular season, Leaf was taking a knee to
end an embarrassing 38-17 loss at Seattle on Dec. 13, 1998. Leaf
had come on for an ineffective Craig Whelihan and proceeded to make
the final three of his 19 turnovers. His final rookie line: two
touchdown passes, 15 interceptions, four lost fumbles and a ton of
off-field trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf's comeback will begin next Sunday at Oakland, where in the
last two seasons the Chargers have played two of their most brutal
games in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf bruised his right hand in Friday night's exhibition finale,
but said he was able to grip a football Saturday morning and
expects no problems.
</P>
<P>
   While he squandered the opportunity he had after being taken
with the second pick overall in the 1998 draft, Leaf has played his
way back into the starting job. He opened camp as the
third-stringer, and because of questions about his shoulder, coach
Mike Riley kept saying that Leaf was the ''X factor'' in the
quarterback competition among Leaf, Jim Harbaugh and Moses Moreno.
</P>
<P>
   Leaf seemed almost subdued Saturday, showing no signs of his
rookie brashness.
</P>
<P>
   ''The way it's played out is always the way I wanted it,'' said
Leaf, who missed last season after tearing cartilage in his
shoulder in the first 20 minutes of training camp and undergoing
surgery. ''It was given to me in my rookie year. Now it looks great
in the order it went. I was able to build myself up and earn it and
that's what feels great to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Riley wanted the competition to play itself out through
the final exhibition game, it's been apparent for a week that the
job was Leaf's.
</P>
<P>
   ''I had a real good feeling after he went 9-for-9 against
Atlanta,'' Riley said. Leaf, who played the first half of that game
Aug. 18, finished 14-of-20 for 167 yards and one touchdown. In four
exhibitions, he was 40-of-63 for 447 yards and three TDs with two
interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The most surprising part of Riley's announcement Saturday is
that Harbaugh, 36, is the third-stringer. Moreno, who like Leaf is
entering his third NFL season, is No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   This is a huge comeback for Leaf, considering that it was just
less than 10 months ago that he was suspended for four weeks for
cursing at then-general manager Bobby Beathard.
</P>
<P>
   In early spring, Leaf complained his passes lacked zip following
surgery in January to clean out his shoulder, and he annoyed the
organization when he stopped showing up for offseason workouts.
</P>
<P>
   But he did rehab his shoulder hard in Birmingham, Ala., under
the watch of noted orthopedic surgeon James Andrews.
</P>
<P>
   ''Dr. Andrews always said, 'There's no doubt you'll play this
year,' '' Leaf said. ''That was always in the back of my mind.
Expectations for me to be at this point were out of the ordinary,
the way we were two months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ''I knew it was getting better. It was just a matter of me
getting on the football field and playing again and hopefully
feeling everything and sure enough, it felt good.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Riley: ''As soon as Ryan sort of confirmed his physical
capabilities, it became more apparent'' that he would be the
starter. ''Physically, he's got a lot of tools.''
</P>
<P>
   But Leaf proved in 1998 that he wasn't grasping the mental side.
He made news with boorish off-field behavior and teammates
complained about his lack of preparation. He was benched after
making nine starts, and would make only one more appearance after
that.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Wildfires Devastate Brazil's Parks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Firefighters working overnight had
managed by Saturday to largely put out a wildfire that destroyed a
third of one of Brazil's major national parks, park authorities
said.
</P>
<P>
   The fire, which began two days ago, burned 50,000 acres of
forested highland savanna in Chapada dos Veadeiros National Park in
central Brazil, said park director Rosalia Gonbim de Castro. Only
scattered patches of flames remained, she said.
</P>
<P>
   To the south, two fires in the Serra da Canastra National Park
were extinguished Friday after firefighters battled the flames for
eight days, said Valdo Veloso, spokesman for Brazil's Environmental
Protection Agency. The fires destroyed 36,000 acres of savanna,
one-fifth of the park's 179,000 acres, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The blazes were the latest in a rash of fires fed by a searing
dry season that have decimated Brazil's biologically important
tropical savannas.
</P>
<P>
   The savanna region -- characterized by hilly grasslands dotted by
shrubs and gnarled trees -- is tinder-dry after an especially severe
dry season, and officials fear more fires in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ''There is a huge mass of dry grass and leaves in these parks
that fuel the fires and cause them to spread extremely rapidly,''
said Paulo Cesar Mendes Ramos, chief of fire prevention for
Brazil's national parks.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will evaluate the impact of the fires to wildlife in
the next several weeks, Ramos said. The savanna parks are home to
several endangered species, including the lobo guara -- known in
English as the savanna wolf -- the jaguar and several bird species.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators believe the fire in Chapada dos Veadeiros National
Park was started by arsonists or someone illegally burning forest
near a road on the park's fringe, Brazil's Environmental Protection
Agency said in a press release. A criminal investigation has been
launched, it said.
</P>
<P>
   The savanna region contains one-third of Brazil's plant and
animal species, according to the Brazilian branch of the World
Wildlife Fund. The organization estimated that only 30 percent of
the original savanna that covered much of central Brazil remains.

<HEADLINE> Experts say mercury spills should be taken seriously  </HEADLINE>
By MARTHA IRVINE
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) - No more than two or three teaspoons of mercury
accidentally spilled when contractors removed aging gas meter
regulators from the basements of dozens of homes in Chicago's
northwest suburbs.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that much, really. Nor is that kind of spill that
uncommon, given the frequent use of elemental mercury in everything
from thermometers and blood pressure gauges to older gas meters.
</P>
<P>
   Still, health experts are cautioning homeowners - particularly
those with children - to get the substance also known as
''quicksilver'' removed from their homes as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have three young children of my own. Absolutely I would be
concerned,'' said Clyde Johnson, an environmental scientist at the
City University of New York's Medgar Evers College, where he and
his colleagues are tracking the effects of mercury in New York
homes and apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Most health experts agree that short exposures to small amounts
of mercury are relatively harmless - for example, when a
thermometer breaks, allowing beads of the silvery liquid metal to
escape. In fact, research has shown little danger in swallowing it.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble comes, they say, when liquid mercury vaporizes.
</P>
<P>
   That can happen, for example, when mercury spills are tracked
onto carpets and dispersed by something as simple as a vacuum
cleaner.
</P>
<P>
   If high levels of mercury are inhaled over long periods of time,
doctors say it can cause respiratory, neurological or kidney
problems. A more extreme example can be found in the story of 19th
century hat makers in Connecticut and England who suffered from
mercury poisoning and became known as ''mad hatters'' because of
neurological problems they developed.
</P>
<P>
   Today, experts say the biggest health risks come from eating
fish that live in mercury-laced waters. The source of that mercury
is pollution, they said. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
scientists estimate about 158 tons of mercury are released into
this country's atmosphere each year, most of it because of
combustible fuels, such as coal.
</P>
<P>
   Given all of that, experts say residents in Chicago's northwest
suburbs still have reason to be concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ''The important thing is to have it handled and cleaned up by a
professional - to look for hidden places where it has
accumulated,'' said Ira Whitman, an environmental engineer from
east Brunswick, N.J., and former official in the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency. ''It has to be taken seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of its heaviness and moldable nature, he says liquid
mercury can find its way into cracks and crevices and even under
floor boards.
</P>
<P>
   That's one reason Johnson says children are particularly at
risk. He says he has also found that mercury tends to vaporize
closer to the ground, particularly in winter when houses are less
ventilated.
</P>
<P>
   Nicor Gas, based in Naperville, began more than a week ago to
inspect and clean up homes where workers from Pennsylvania
contractor Henkels &AMP; McCoy Inc. spilled mercury in basements while
replacing outdated gas meters with newer models last year.
</P>
<P>
   As of Friday, Nicor spokesman Lee Haines said the utility had
identified about 170 homes in 11 suburbs north and west of Chicago
as potentially at risk. Of those tested, mercury was found in at
least 34, with some of the families having to be evacuated.
</P>
<P>
   On that same day one of the Nicor crews detected mercury in a
home where a regulator had been removed by a Nicor technician in
1989 - the first time an apparent mercury incident had been linked
to a Nicor employee. That led the company to announce Saturday that
it would expand the number of homes to be tested to as many as
200,000.
</P>
<P>
   Before Nicor's announcement Saturday, Tom Schafer, a spokesman
with the Illinois Department of Public Health, said officials at
his agency estimate as many as 200 homes may need to be checked,
since mercury can be transported from home to home on shoes and
other items. Schafer could not be reached for comment Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Schafer said dozens of people have called the department's
mercury hot line (888-522-1282), but he said most have discovered
that their homes do not have the kind of meter regulators that are
causing problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge - so far, the
hardest-hit suburb - also has established a clinic for mercury
poisoning.

<HEADLINE> Yankees 10, Athletics 6  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. (AP) -- Clay Bellinger tripled twice and drove in
three runs to help Orlando Hernandez win his second straight start
as the New York Yankees defeated the Oakland Athletics 10-6 on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez (10-10), who had lost four straight decisions before
winning his last two, struck out a season-high 11 in seven innings.
He gave up three runs, five hits and three walks.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Mulder (7-10) allowed six runs and 10 hits in two-plus
innings, his shortest outing of the year. He walked one and struck
out one as he lost for the eighth time in 10 decisions since June
30.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams, who missed the previous seven games with a
strained right rib cage, singled in the first inning to score Derek
Jeter. Tino Martinez added a two-run single in the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Luis Sojo had an RBI single in the second and Jose Canseco hit
his 12th homer leading off the third. It was the 443rd homer of his
career, which moves him into sole possession of 23rd place on the
career list.
</P>
<P>
   Jorge Posada doubled homer Martinez to make it 6-0 and end
Mulder's day.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinger tripled home two runs and Jeter added a sacrifice fly
in the fifth against reliever Omar Olivares.
</P>
<P>
   Bellinger was also credited with a triple when Terrence Long
lost his fly ball in the sun in the seventh, scoring Scott Brosius.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Chavez hit his 19th homer, a two-run shot off Hernandez in
the third, and Frank Menechino hit a three-run homer in the ninth
off Mike Stanton.
</P>
<P>
   Mariano Rivera got one out for his 28th save in 33 chances.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Yankees are 33-19 since July 1, the best record in the
AL. ... Williams snapped an 0-for-12 streak with his first-inning
single. ... The A's lead the majors with 117 errors. ... Mulder is
the first A's rookie to lose 10 games in a season since Chris
Codiroli went 12-12 and Tim Conroy was 7-10 in 1983. ... A's LHP
Mike Magnante has allowed one run in his last 15 appearances (10
2-3 innings) ... Long, who had his first career four hit game,
leads all rookies in runs scored (80). ... Canseco, who spent parts
of nine seasons with the A's, has hit 122 homers in the Oakland
Coliseum, his most at any ballpark.

<HEADLINE> Blazers, Cavs, Heat To Seal Deal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- There have been no snags with Portland's
trade plans, and Shawn Kemp should be a member of the Trail Blazers
and Brian Grant a member of the Miami Heat by the end of next week.
</P>
<P>
   The parties agreed to the deal two weeks ago, and it could
officially happen as early as Wednesday, The Oregonian reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers will acquire Kemp, a six-time All-Star, from
Cleveland. They will send Grant to Miami and Gary Grant to the
Cavaliers. The Heat will trade Chris Gatling and Clarence
Weatherspoon, along with a first-round draft pick and cash, to the
Cavaliers.
</P>
<P>
   Miami also wants to send guard Harold Jamison to the Blazers, a
move that would enable Brian Grant's new seven-year contract to
jump from about $84 million to $89 million.
</P>
<P>
   The possible addition of Jamison, who would see little laying
time with the Blazers, is not expected to be a deal breaker, The
Oregonian reported.
</P>
<P>
   The trade was delayed because of an NBA rule that prevented
Miami from dealing Gatling until Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the holdup will allow Blazers president and
general manager Bob Whitsitt to return from a family vacation in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
   ''You never say never, but no, I don't see anything at this
stage that could stop this trade from happening,'' said Kemp's
agent, Tony Dutt. ''I'm not aware of any issues or anything that
could change the process.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemp, 30, has worn out his welcome after three seasons in
Cleveland with a bad attitude and with his struggles to stay in
shape. But he still has plenty of offensive skills.
</P>
<P>
   ''Shawn is really excited about coming to Portland,'' Dutt said.
''We think mentally this is where he needs to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant opted out of the remaining four years and $40 million on
his previous contract, primarily because he knew the Blazers were
interested in acquiring Kemp. Like Kemp, Grant is looking forward
to a change of scenery.
</P>
<P>
   ''Miami is Miami. It's a paradise,'' Grant said. ''You've got
beaches and all those types of things. It's not Portland -- I can't
go salmon fishing -- and there is no city like Portland. But I don't
want to start comparing cities.''
</P>
<P>
   Grant could re-sign with the Blazers and refuse a trade. But
under league rules, Portland still could trade him after Dec. 15 --
to Cleveland or any other team.

Israeli Troops Raid Islamic Stronghold
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   NABLUS, West Bank (AP) -- Hundreds of Israeli troops raided an Islamic
militant stronghold Saturday, and an Arabic TV station quoted witnesses as
saying three Israeli soldiers were killed. Nine Israeli soldiers and several
Palestinians were injured in the fighting in the West Bank, said Qatar-based Al
Jazeera TV. The Israeli army declined to comment. Troops sealed the village, a
stronghold of the Islamic militant group Hamas, and imposed a curfew, with
hundreds of soldiers patrolling the streets and conducting house-to-house
searches, the witnesses said.

Tiger Woods Leads NEC Invitational
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   AKRON, Ohio (AP) -- Fourteen straight pars and a wasp sting failed to stop
Tiger Woods from running away with the NEC Invitational today. Woods finally
cooled off at Firestone Country Club after a birdie-eagle-birdie start. He got
stung on his left finger when he tried to remove a wounded wasp on the 15th
green. All that mattered at the end of the day was his 3-under 67, which gave
him a nine-stroke lead.

Houston Comets Win WNBA Title
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   HOUSTON (AP) -- Sheryl Swoopes scored 31 points and Cynthia Cooper had 25 in
her final game as the Houston Comets rallied to beat the New York Liberty 79-73
in overtime today for their fourth straight WNBA championship. Swoopes, the
league's MVP and leading scorer this season, and three-time scoring champion
Cooper took charge of the game in the second half. They combined for 32 of the
Comets' final 36 points. Cooper, who said she'd retire after the playoffs, hit a
3-pointer with 21 seconds to play that tied the game at 64-64 and forced
overtime. Swoopes' 31 points set a career playoff high.

<HEADLINE> Four Die in Russia Market Stampede  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MAKHACHKALA, Russia (AP) -- A rumor that a bomb had been found
set off a stampede in a crowded market Saturday, killing four
people and injuring 17, officials in the Russian republic of
Dagestan said.
</P>
<P>
   The victims died when they rushed to squeeze through the
market's narrow exits in Khasavyurt, a town near the border with
the breakaway republic of Chechnya, Dagestan's Interior Ministry
said.
</P>
<P>
   There were about 5,000 people in the market when the rumor
spread. No bomb was found in a subsequent search, said a ministry
spokesman in Makhachkala, Dagestan's capital.
</P>
<P>
   Khasavyurt is in a part of Dagestan that was invaded twice last
year by Chechnya-based rebels seeking to carve out an Islamic
state. A car bomb earlier this month killed two people in the town.

By The Associated PressL. Bryce Boyer:
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Dr. L. Bryce Boyer, a psychoanalyst who
advanced the idea that analysts may experience emotional reactions
to patients that reflect their own inner conflicts and needs, died
Aug. 9. He was 84.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer held the unpopular view that countertransference could be
an important tool in helping patients.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer lectured throughout the United States and Europe and found
that his peers abroad, especially in South America, held a more
favorable view of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   He also argued in favor of using psychoanalysis not only for the
''worried well,'' he said, but also for people with serious
psychological illnesses such as addiction, borderline pathology and
psychosis.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer founded the Boyer House, a nonprofit residential
psychoanalytic treatment center, in San Rafael.
Ed Grennan:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Ed Grennan, a longtime Chicago television and
radio host, died Tuesday of a heart attack. He was 78.
</P>
<P>
   Grennan, whose career in Chicago broadcasting spanned 50 years,
most recently appeared as a supporting actor in the critically
acclaimed movie, ''The Straight Story.''
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, he was one of the first disc jockeys at
WLS-AM, playing Dixie, jazz and rock music. He also worked at
WGN-AM and WAIT-AM before moving to NBC, where he spent nearly 30
years until he retired in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   At NBC's WMAQ-FM, he was the host of ''Problems and Solutions.''
It was on that show that he took calls from listeners and offered
advice.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1960s he was the host of television games shows such
as ''Everything's Relative.''
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, three daughters, three sons and two
grandchildren.
Leonard Japp:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- Leonard Japp Sr., widely recognized as the
entrepreneur behind the modern, corn oil-fried potato chip, died
Thursday. He was 96.
</P>
<P>
   Japp founded Jays Foods, whose slogan is ''Can't stop eating
'em.''
</P>
<P>
   He saw his company grow from a two-person operation delivering
nuts and pretzels to Al Capone's speakeasies in 1927 to a business
that currently employs 1,000 people and sells snacks in Illinois,
Indiana, Wisconsin, Michigan, Missouri, Minnesota and Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the company's leading house brand, Mrs. Japp's
chips, fell victim to anti-Japanese sentiment after the bombing of
Pearl Harbor in 1941 and disappeared from grocery store shelves.
</P>
<P>
   Japp quickly changed the company's name, then known as Special
Foods Co., to Jays Foods.
</P>
<P>
   Jays grew to $64 million in annual sales by 1986 and the family
sold the company to Borden Inc. But by 1994, Jays was losing $17
million a year, prompting the family and other investors to buy it
back.
Serge Lebovici:
</P>
<P>
   PARIS (AP) -- Serge Lebovici, a noted child psychiatrist and the
only Frenchman to head the International Psychoanalytic
Association, died of heart failure Aug. 12. He was 85.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 10, 1915, Lebovici was the son of a Jewish doctor who
was deported to Auschwitz by the Nazis during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   He was professor of child psychiatry at the University of
Paris-North and founded numerous professional associations
dedicated to the study of mental illness among children.
</P>
<P>
   Lebovici was also the author or co-author of numerous works,
including ''Understanding the Child through Psychoanalysis,'' ''The
Infant, the Mother and the Psychoanalyst,'' and ''New Treatments
for the Child and Adolescent.''
Lynden Pindling:
</P>
<P>
   NASSAU, Bahamas (AP) -- Former Prime Minister Lynden Pindling,
leader of the Bahamas for 25 years, died Saturday of prostate
cancer. He was 70.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling became premier in 1967 when the islands were still a
British colony, and led the Bahamas to independence in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   However, his reputation suffered from never-proven allegations
of bribery and protecting drug traffickers, which clouded the
country's relations with the United States and contributed to
Pindling's defeat in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Pindling's policies helped create a large black middle class by
broadening educational opportunities for the country's 172,000
people. But the Bahamas also became a major drug-trafficking haven
under his tenure in the late 1970s and 1980s, which critics blamed
on government inaction.
</P>
<P>
   A series of scandals -- he was accused of covering up for drug
lords in the 1980s and taking bribes as chairman of the state Hotel
Commission -- contributed to his party's downfall. It won only six
of the 40 seats in the National Assembly in the March 1997
elections, when Ingraham gained a second term.
</P>
<P>
   A government commission was unable to substantiate any of the
claims against Pindling.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his conflicted past, Bahamians mourned the loss of the
leader known as the ''Black Moses,'' who helped found the
Progressive Liberal Party in 1953 as a grass-roots opposition to
the mostly white colonial-run United Bahamian Party.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Hoops Team Has First Practice  </HEADLINE>
By CHRIS SHERIDAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAHAINA, Hawaii (AP) -- After settling in comfortably at their
luxury hotel, the U.S. Olympic men's basketball team made it
through the first day of practice Saturday with only one minor
injury.
</P>
<P>
   Vin Baker twisted his left ankle while landing awkwardly after
taking a shot, but he said the injury would probably not keep him
from practicing Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. team spent much its time working on half-court drills
and scrimmaging, both 3-on-3 and 5-on-5, under the direction of
coach Rudy Tomjanovich.
</P>
<P>
   ''The intensity was high and the conditioning was good,'' said
Tomjanovich, who plans to increase the pace of practices over the
next several days of training camp. ''You can't go with the Marine
deal right away because you'll get a lot of injuries.''
</P>
<P>
   The American team will spend the next week in Hawaii, holding
training camp on the island of Maui and playing two exhibition
games, against Canada and the U.S. Select Team, in Honolulu.
</P>
<P>
   Their practice court is at the Lahaina Civic Center, which does
not have air conditioning, although their accommodations are seven
miles up the road in Kapalua at one of the finest hotels on the
island. So ritzy is it, in fact, that players have the option of
ordering three different kinds of butler-drawn baths complete with
milk whey powder, lavender bath oil and/or floating orchids. The
price: $50.
</P>
<P>
   Lavish accommodations are standard fare for NBA players, but the
chance to play in the Olympics is not. And so it was with a
palpable sense of eagerness that the U.S. team went into its first
practice at the steamy gymnasium less than a mile up a hill from
the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Hardaway ended practice by sinking a shot from midcourt
barefooted.
</P>
<P>
   ''Well, it was hot,'' Jason Kidd said, ''But we got some of the
garbage out of the exhaust pipes. It was a good practice.''
</P>
<P>
   And aside from Baker's little misstep, it was nothing like the
first practice the U.S. team held one year ago upon its arrival in
Puerto Rico for the Olympic qualifying tournament.
</P>
<P>
   At that practice, which turned out to be the only one the team
ever held in Puerto Rico, Tom Gugliotta broke his nose and Richard
Hamilton sprained his ankle so severely that he never got to play
in the qualifying tourney.
</P>
<P>
   ''You kind of expect something like that to happen on Day One,
but you don't expect it to happen to you.,'' said Baker, who has
lost 15 pounds since the end of last season and now weighs in at
258.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Gen.: Radical Islam a Danger  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) -- The newly appointed chief of Turkey's
powerful army warned that any concessions to radical Islam would
pull the country back to the Middle Ages, newspapers reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's military leaders have spearheaded the secular state's
battle against Islamic political movements, identifying them as one
of the main threats to the republic.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Hilmi Ozkok, speaking Friday at his inauguration as army
chief, said radical Islamic factions ''aim to destroy the successes
of Turkey's democratic and secular republic, which is based on the
rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   ''It is clear that any deviation or concession on these basic
principles will bring this country to the darkness of the Middle
Ages,'' Ozkok was quoted as saying by the Sabah daily.
</P>
<P>
   Ozkok's statements come amid a controversy that pits President
Ahmet Necdet Sezer against Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit.
</P>
<P>
   Ecevit has accused the president of encouraging radical Islam by
refusing to sign a decree that would let the government sack
thousands of civil servants suspected of sympathizing with Islamic
factions. Sezer said the decree was unconstitutional because it
lacked parliament's approval.
</P>
<P>
   The government will present the decree to parliament when it
convenes in October, and the military has already urged lawmakers
to swiftly adopt the bill. But the decree is likely to face strong
opposition in parliament, which is dominated by conservative and
Islamic lawmakers.
</P>
<P>
   The military has carried out three coups since 1960. It
pressured Turkey's first Islamic-led government out of office in
1997.

<HEADLINE> Packers 34, Browns 33  </HEADLINE>
By GREG BEACHAM
<TEXT>
<P>
   GREEN BAY, Wis. (AP) -- The Green Bay Packers' defensive starters
finally stopped somebody -- even if it was only the Cleveland
Browns.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay's first-string defense forced its first two punts of
the preseason and Bill Schroeder caught two touchdown passes as the
Packers held on to beat the Browns 34-33 Saturday night in the
NFL's final preseason game.
</P>
<P>
   Backup fullback Matt Snider caught a short pass from Danny
Wuerffel and rumbled 66 yards for the go-ahead touchdown with 5:28
left.
</P>
<P>
   The Browns made a late scoring drive on five straight passes
from Kevin Thompson to Dennis Northcutt -- including a 26-yard TD
pass with 50 seconds left -- but Thompson's pass to Northcutt on the
two-point conversion attempt was low and wide.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Hasselbeck and Wuerffel each threw two touchdown passes in
place of Brett Favre, who watched in shorts and a T-shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Favre, who rested the tendinitis in his right elbow for the
third straight game, hasn't played since the first two series in
Green Bay's preseason opener on Aug. 4. But he is expected to play
next week against the New York Jets, keeping alive his NFL-record
streak of 125 consecutive starts.
</P>
<P>
   The Packers' defense, still learning the scheme of new
coordinator Ed Donatell, forced Cleveland to punt on its first two
possessions. Of course, the Browns had just six points in their
last eight quarters of play prior to the game.
</P>
<P>
   Embattled quarterback Tim Couch again struggled to spark the
Browns' offense, but Cleveland scored its first touchdown since the
preseason opener when Errict Rhett dove in from 1 yard with 11:09
left in the second quarter. Couch, who didn't practice until
Thursday while resting a sore arm, was 7-of-11 for 96 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Cleveland (1-3) lost its final three preseason games, while
Green Bay (2-2) won both of its home exhibitions.
</P>
<P>
   Hasselbeck had another outstanding game, completing 10 of 12
passes for 137 yards and two touchdowns while leading the Packers
on three scoring drives. He hit Schroeder for TD passes of 24 and
16 yards in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams played their starters into the second quarter, and
the real competition for jobs began in the second half. Among the
young Browns making the best impressions were Rashidi Barnes and
fellow rookie defensive back Anthony Malbrough, who played tight
defense in place of injured starter Daylon McCutcheon.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Travis Prentice solidified his backup spot behind Rhett
by rushing for 55 yards and a touchdown, while rookie quarterback
Spergon Wynn led two scoring drives in the fourth quarter and
Thompson another. Still, the Browns are expected to sign or trade
for a veteran backup quarterback sometime this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes returned an interception 83 yards for a touchdown with
1:09 left in the second quarter. Barnes darted in front of a Green
Bay receiver to pick off Wuerffel's quick slant pass, then dodged
Wuerffel downfield and outran the Packers to score.
</P>
<P>
   In a mild surprise, Herbert ''Whisper'' Goodman appeared to
decisively win his battle with Basil Mitchell for the Packers' last
running back spot.
</P>
<P>
   Goodman, a rookie from NAIA Division II Graceland (Iowa), rushed
for 88 yards on 21 carries and also caught three passes for a
team-high 67 yards, while Mitchell -- playing mostly with the
Packers' starters -- was stymied with just 15 yards on 11 carries.
</P>
<P>
   Receiver Kevin Johnson returned for Cleveland after missing two
games with a hamstring pull, but he strained the hamstring again
and was taken out. Starting cornerback Corey Fuller sprained a toe
and also left early.
</P>
<P>
   Green Bay plays host to the Jets next Sunday, while the Browns
play Jacksonville.

<HEADLINE> Muslim Rebels' Hostages To Be Freed  </HEADLINE>
By JIM GOMEZ
<TEXT>
<P>
   ZAMBOANGA, Philippines (AP) -- Negotiators flew Sunday to a
remote Philippine island where they hope Muslim rebels will release
at least six of the 12 foreign hostages they have held for months
in jungle camps.
</P>
<P>
   ''The rebels are ready. They are waiting,'' said a go-between
who has helped with previous releases. The man, code-named
''Dragon,'' is the uncle of one of the Abu Sayyaf rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf rebels agreed a day earlier to release six
hostages, including four women, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   They made the pledge after a Zamboanga court freed two
guerrillas caught carrying bundles of cash believed to be part of
an earlier ransom payment, officials said. Rebel commander Ghalib
''Robot'' Andang had demanded the guerrillas be freed before he
would release more captives, negotiators said.
</P>
<P>
   Andang called chief negotiator Robert Aventajado on Saturday and
asked whether the two men had been released, a negotiator said.
When he heard they were out on bail, he agreed to free four
remaining female hostages -- three French and a South African -- plus
German Werner Wallert and a Finnish man.
</P>
<P>
   Libya has agreed to pay $1 million for each of the hostages,
according to members of the negotiating panel. Negotiators foresaw
no snags that might halt the release, and they said they were
trying to persuade the rebels to free two other hostages as well.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're very hopeful,'' negotiator Farouk Hussein said.
</P>
<P>
   The two arrested rebels, Jeffrey Lau Jinnul and Adjid Halik,
were detained Thursday while trying to convert $240,000 into
Philippine pesos at a Zamboanga bank. They were charged with being
accessories to kidnapping. Halik is the brother-in-law of an Abu
Sayyaf commander, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   Police said they were pressured by high government officials to
release the men. They were freed Saturday on $2,700 bail each.
</P>
<P>
   The court held on to the $240,000. The men admitted they had
received the money from the rebels, police said.
</P>
<P>
   The military estimates the rebels have been paid more than $5.5
million for the earlier releases of nine Malaysians and a German.
</P>
<P>
   The Abu Sayyaf, the smaller of two major rebel groups in the
southern Philippines, says it is fighting for an independent
Islamic state in the region. The government insists the
organization is a group of bandits practicing kidnapping and
piracy.
</P>
<P>
   A group of rebels have been holding hostages for months in a
jungle on remote Jolo island, 580 miles south of Manila. Still in
captivity there are three French, two Germans, two Finns and two
South Africans kidnapped April 23 from a Malaysian diving resort;
three French television journalists seized last month and 12
Filipino Christian evangelists who went to the rebel camp to pray
for the hostages.
</P>
<P>
   All 12 remaining foreign hostages were to have been released
last week, but that plan failed when Libya, which is playing a
prominent role in the negotiations, offered to pay only $700,000
per captive instead of the $1 million demanded by the guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
   Commander Andang agreed to reschedule the release after Libya
said it would pay the full amount, negotiators said. But he said he
would free only six initially because of fears of a military attack
after all are released, a rebel spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   After the hostages are freed, they are to fly on a Libyan jet to
Tripoli, where they are to meet with Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi.

<HEADLINE> Triathlete Closes in on Goal  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- Marathon swimmer Jim Dreyer conquered
his fourth Great Lake, but he wasn't finished with his
ultra-triathlon.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer touched the shore of Toronto around 7 p.m. Saturday after
running a marathon of 26.2 miles, biking 112 miles and swimming
Lake Ontario over two days, according to his Web site, which
periodically posted updates on his progress.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer started swimming south after the touchdown, with a goal
of reaching Niagara-on-the-Lake, N.Y., by Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   During his swim across Lake Ontario, which began Friday night,
his goggles leaked causing the water to swell his right eye,
according to the Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The Byron Center native failed to complete his first endurance
test last month due to dehydration and fatigue. This time around,
he planned a nonstop athletic feat that would cover 201.4 total
miles if completed.
</P>
<P>
   He was near the end of his feat and needed only to turn right
back around and swim back to Niagara-On-The-Lake for a total of
63.2 swimming miles.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Dreyer has spent nearly 36 hours of continuous running,
biking, and swimming. There's an estimated 18-26 hours of swimming
left.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer, 37, started his marathon-length run Friday morning. He
originally planned to begin around 7 a.m., though the exact time he
actually started was unclear. His Web site did not note his
starting time.
</P>
<P>
   The site said Dreyer completed the run shortly after 1 p.m. Ten
minutes later, after changing gear, he started the bicycling
portion of the event.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer earlier said he figured to spend about 12 hours running
and biking and another 46 hours swimming, meaning his attempt would
end sometime Sunday evening.
</P>
<P>
   All of Dreyer's athletic tests have been to raise money for Big
Brothers Big Sisters of America, a youth-mentoring program.
</P>
<P>
   On July 24, Dreyer set out to swim Lake Erie, run 26.2 miles,
bike 112 miles and then swim Lake Ontario.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer swam 26 miles across Lake Erie and completed the run, but
stopped before bicycling because he suffered dehydration and
cramping and could not remain conscious. His body temperature
dropped to 93.7 degrees, and he had to wrap himself in blankets to
ease shivering.
</P>
<P>
   Dreyer, who swam across Lake Michigan in 1998 and Lake Huron in
1999, told The Grand Rapids Press before starting his most recent
feat that he expected a tough mental challenge after reaching
Toronto, the halfway point of his swim.
</P>
<P>
   ''The toughest part of this thing is going to Toronto and not
getting out of the water,'' he said. ''Getting out in Toronto is
not an option. You can't even have that thought in the back of your
mind.''
</P>
<P>
   In training for this ultra-triathlon, Dreyer said he has worked
with a sports nutritionist in the hope of avoiding the severe
cramping that doomed his last effort.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. (AP) -- Hristo Stoitchkov scored in the 88th minute
as the Chicago Fire battled back from a two-goal deficit to tie the
Tampa Bay Mutiny 3-3 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Stoitchkov's goal from 16 yards out deflected off goalkeeper
Scott Garlick. It was one of two goals the Fire scored while the
Mutiny played shorthanded. Peter Nowak got Chicago within 3-2 on a
73rd-minute goal after Josh Keller received his second yellow card
in the 55th minute.
</P>
<P>
   Tampa Bay's Mamadou Diallo scored his league-leading 23rd goal.
Steve Trittschuh and Manny Lagos also scored for the Mutiny, who
lead MLS' Central Division by three points over Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   Ante Razov, who received a red card during second-half injury
time for taking down Dominic Kinnear, had Chicago's other goal.
Razov, who has 16 goals, started the day tied for second in
goal-scoring.

<P>
   Headers by Diallo, in the 38th minute, and Trittschuh, during

<HEADLINE> Kansas State's Allen Injured  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- A clipping penalty prevented Kansas
State running back David Allen from breaking the NCAA career record
for punt returns for touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Then he got hurt just after he fumbled to set up Iowa's lone
touchdown in No. 8 Kansas State's 27-7 victory in the Eddie
Robinson Classic on Saturday at Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Demond Sanders tackled Allen early in the fourth quarter,
forcing Allen to leave the field with a limp. Coach Bill Snyder
said an X-ray after the game indicated no fracture, but the
seriousness of Allen's injury had not been determined.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think he's going to be OK,'' Snyder said of Allen, projected
to be the Wildcats' top running back.
</P>
<P>
   Allen needs one punt return for a touchdown to break the record
of seven she shares with Nebraska's Johnny Rodgers and Oklahoma's
Jack Mitchell. Allen tied the record on a 74-yard run against Texas
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Allen also needs just 101 punt return yards to top Vanderbilt's
Lee Nalley's career punt return record set in 1947-49.
</P>
<P>
   The penalty negating the touchdown infuriated Snyder.
</P>
<P>
   ''It was beyond disappointment,'' Snyder said. ''I was visibly
angry. That's the second time a touchdown has been called back for
exactly that same reason.
</P>
<P>
   ''I appreciate the enthusiasm to go down there and block
somebody to give David a chance and give our team the chance to
score a touchdown. But you've got to have discipline and we didn't
have that. That upsets me.''
</P>
<P>
   Allen had 29 yards on five punt returns. He rushed for 71 yards
on 15 attempts and had a 1-yard touchdown run.
</P>
<P>
   Allen was hurt after he fumbled. Senior Chris Claybon went in
for Allen at running back after the injury, while Aaron Lockett
returned punts.
</P>
<P>
   ''I hope he's OK,'' offensive coordinator Ron Hudson said. ''I
have no idea on his status. He played a solid game. He did miss
some pass protection and he got stripped that one time.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder said Allen needs time to develop as Kansas State's
starting running back.
</P>
<P>
   ''David will be fine. He just needs opportunity after
opportunity,'' he said. ''He's one of those that needs three or
four times to get it. He may miss a read or take it outside instead
of going up the middle, then all of a sudden, he's gone.''

<TEXT>
<P>
	   CLIFTON PARK, N.Y. (AP) - Karen Potter, managing editor for
features at the Albany Times Union, died in her home Saturday after
battling a rare form of bone cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Oklahoma-reared and Texas-trained, Potter combined a small-town
humility with a fearlessness in taking on powerful interests and
outsized personalities that she developed during a decade covering
Lone Star State politics for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.
</P>
<P>
   Former Texas Gov. Ann Richards remembered Potter as ''a
tenacious reporter'' who buttonholed the Democratic governor daily,
''even sometimes when I wished fervently not to see another
newspaper reporter.'' But Potter, he said, stood out from the
statehouse press corps in Austin as ''a little more gracious in her
manner, a little more thoughtful in her questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Co-workers at the Times Union remembered Potter for displaying
the soul of a social worker. ''I want to make a difference,''
Potter said in an application letter to the Times Union. She joined
the paper in 1995 and fulfilled that promise, said Jeff Cohen,
Times Union vice president and editor.
</P>
<P>
   ''Karen embodied what is right about journalism,'' Cohen said.
''Her priorities were fine writing, unshakable ethics and editing
features sections that challenged our readers.''

<HEADLINE> Yemen Opposition Leaders Arrested  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN'A, Yemen (AP) -- Police arrested five leaders of Yemen's
largest opposition group Saturday, accusing them of meeting without
a permit, police and party officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Police detained the Socialist party leaders as they met in the
southern city of Aden to prepare for a national convention due to
be held in the capital, San'a, on Aug. 30.
</P>
<P>
   ''The police excuses are weak,'' said Mohamed Abdel Wahid, the
Socialist party's chief of information. ''The Yemeni Socialist
party is a legitimate party operating with an official government
license and, therefore, is free to operate in public without the
need of an official police permit.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those detained was Ali Monasser Mohammed, the secretary
general of the party's San'a bureau, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The party has often accused the government of undemocratic
practices. It boycotted last year's presidential elections.

	   BEACON, N.Y. (AP) - A 1930's diner that was the setting for

<HEADLINE> Skimming Wins Pacific Classsic  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEL MAR, Calif. (AP) -- Skimming led the entire way for a
two-length victory in the $1 million Pacific Classic on Saturday,
giving trainer Bobby Frankel his fifth win in the 10-year history
of the race.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, the defending champion and a 9-10 favorite,
placed fourth with substitute jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. riding. He
drew the mount after Corey Nakatani was injured two races earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Skimming, with Garrett Gomez aboard, paid $11.40, $6.40 and
$4.80 in the race over 1&AMP;frac14; miles for 3-year-olds and up at Del Mar.
</P>
<P>
   Nakatani broke his left collarbone in a fall while riding
Candance in Paris in the sixth race. The tumble came on the final
turn when Candance in Paris clipped heals with Elderberry, which
was called for interference and given last place after finishing
second.
</P>
<P>
   The injury is expected to sideline Nakatani up to five weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Candance in Paris, which broke a shoulder, was humanely
destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Tiznow, the only 3-year-old in the seven-horse field, finished
1&AMP;frac14; lengths ahead of Ecton Park. General Challenge came from the
back of the field to finish a half-length behind Ecton Park.
</P>
<P>
   Frankel recorded four straight victories in the race from
1992-95, including the last two with Tinners Way.
</P>
<P>
   ''This (latest win) ranks up there,'' Frankel said. ''They are
all great. The first has to be the best. But this is a horse that
was sent to me without high expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   Skimming, owned by Juddmonte Farms, came off an eight-length
victory in the San Diego Handicap at Del Mar on Aug. 6. Since
starting with Frankel in March, Skimming has four wins, a second
and a third in six races.
</P>
<P>
   ''We were cooking out there. I knew that,'' Gomez said. ''I was
just riding him the way Bobby told me to. Bobby said, 'Leave him
alone and let him do what he wants.' So I did.''
</P>
<P>
   Gomez, 28, won on his first mount in the Pacific Classic. He
rode at Del Mar in 1994 and became a Southern California regular in
late 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Pincay, who picked up two mounts during the day, had his seventh
ride of the day on General Challenge and finished with eight mounts
on the 10-race card.
</P>
<P>
   ''At the half-mile pole, I thought I was in a great position
(with General Challenge),'' Pincay said. ''But there was no fire in
him then. I asked, but it wasn't there.''
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge came in as the favorite despite losing his
last two races. He lost to Early Pioneer by a length in the
Hollywood Gold Cup on July 9, following a 90-day layoff after
incurring a throat problem in an April race.
</P>
<P>
   Since last year's win in the Pacific Classic, General Challenge
had three victories in eight races.
</P>
<P>
   Ecton Park, who has only one win this year, was the only entry
from the East Coast in the field.
</P>
<P>
   In another mishap before the Pacific Classic, jockey Chris
McCarron was thrown by Mandola heading to the gate for the seventh
race. Mandola raced unattended around the track and was scratched.

past.'' Obasanjo won office last year after death removed Nigeria's dictator,
Gen. Sani Abacha, from power and led to a quick turn to democracy.

<HEADLINE> Henninger Leads Reno-Tahoe Open  </HEADLINE>
By SCOTT SONNER
<TEXT>
<P>
   RENO, Nev. (AP) -- Frenchman Jean Van de Velde shot a 7-under-par
65 in windy conditions Saturday to take a two-stroke lead after the
third round of the Reno-Tahoe Open.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, famous for squandering a three-stroke lead on the
final hole of the British Open last year at Carnoustie, had a
13-under 203 total.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Henninger, who matched the course record with a 63 in the
second round, shot a 71 for a 205 total. Bob May, who lost a
playoff to Tiger Woods last week in the PGA championship, was
another stroke back along with David Toms and Doug Dunakey.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde hasn't won on the PGA European Tour since 1993 and
is angling for his first PGA Tour victory.
</P>
<P>
   ''I think the memory is still going to be alive no matter how
many wins I have,'' Van de Velde said of the disastrous finish 13
months ago. ''But you have to move on. If I arrive three ahead here
on the 72nd hole, let's see if I can manage to do better than a
triple.''
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, who started the day four strokes behind Henninger,
said he could tell on the practice range that a good round would be
difficult with the wind gusting from 15 to 25 mph on the Montreux
course on the edge of the Sierra Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   ''In Europe, it's very common to us. I was very patient and hit
two good shots coming in,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On the 584-yard, par-5 14th, he hooked a 2-iron shot around a
tree and hit a wedge within 3 feet to set up a birdie putt. On the
par-4 18th, he hit a wedge within 3 feet again and made another
birdie.
</P>
<P>
   ''The competition is very, very high here. If I'm lucky to pull
it out, I'd be very, very happy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Van de Velde, who remains in good spirits despite being forced
to relive the Carnoustie disaster, said the overall experience
there was a good one.
</P>
<P>
   ''The only one painful thing is I didn't have my name on the
trophy,'' he said. He said the response from fans around the world
has been overwhelmingly supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was leading by three with a few shots to go. It really
proved to me I've got what it takes to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunakey, best known for shooting a 59 on the Nike Tour in 1998,
had the best round Saturday -- an 8-under 64.
</P>
<P>
   ''I felt comfortable probably because I was so far from the
lead,'' Dunakey said. ''I'm thinking there's no reason to get
stressed out. The worst case scenario is I'd have to get a job.''
</P>
<P>
   Dunakey tied Notah Begay's record for the lowest round on the
Nike Tour, now known as the Buy.com Tour, with a 59 two years ago.
On Saturday, he hit a 5 iron within 15 feet of the pin on the
518-yard, par-5 fourth hole and made the putt for eagle, then
dropped a 50-foot putt for birdie on the 439-yard, par-4 sixth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I haven't made a putt like that in a couple of years,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Begay, playing in the World Golf Championships-NEC Invitational
this week, won the inaugural Reno-Tahoe Open last year and has
added three other tour victories.
</P>
<P>
   ''One thing I was thinking about out there was that Notah won
here last year and he's one of the 59 club. I thought if he can
kick start his year here, maybe I could too,'' Dunakey said.
</P>
<P>
   May birdied the 18th hole for a 70, and Toms shot a 69 to join
Dunakey at 206.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Jacobsen, who opened with rounds of 66 and 69, shot a 76
to drop eight strokes back at 5-under 211.
</P>
<P>
   Spanish star Sergio Garcia entered the third round at 5 under,
but had a 75 Saturday to slip to 2 under.

   WILLIAMSPORT, Pa. (AP) -- Actor Kevin Costner is no stranger to
awards.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the Academy Awards that Costner received for his
work on the film ''Dances With Wolves,'' the actor is often honored
by different organizations.
</P>
<P>
   But Costner referred to his induction into the Little League
Hall of Excellence as different.
</P>
<P>
   ''This clearly was just kind of a nod to myself and to the
game,'' Costner said after his induction Saturday, ''And I felt
like nodding back because it was a love affair for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Joining Costner as 2000 inductees were Billy Hunter, executive
director of the NBA Players Association and Dr. Robert Stratta, a
groundbreaking transplant surgeon.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the star of films like ''Field of Dreams'' and ''Bull
Durham'' who attracted the large crowd to the induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   Costner's reception by the crowd was the best ever for a Hall
inductee, according to Little League spokesman Lance Van Auken.
</P>
<P>
   And Costner responded with a poignant speech.
</P>
<P>
   ''Baseball, Little League, was such a huge part of my life as a
kid and as a father,'' said Costner, who has two daughters and a
son. ''The memories are, in fact, so thick that I have to brush
them away from my face.''

<HEADLINE> Nader Hails WTO Protesters  </HEADLINE>
By MIA PENTA
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE (AP) -- Green Party presidential hopeful Ralph Nader said
Saturday that last fall's World Trade Organization protests were a
watershed in American history, and he hopes the same populist wave
responsible carries him to the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ''The beautiful aspect of it is, it didn't end in Seattle,''
Nader told 300 people jammed into the Seattle Labor Temple. ''This
is an all-purpose social justice movement.''
</P>
<P>
   Nader was still exulting from the biggest event of his campaign.
On Friday night, 10,000 people paid $7 each to hear him at the
Memorial Coliseum in Portland, Ore. He said Democratic nominee Vice
President Al Gore and Republican nominee George W. Bush could not
have drawn that many people without help from big-money
contributors.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, he held a news conference and endorsed state
Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn for U.S. Senate before visiting
the labor hall, where he told supporters the Democratic Party has
taken the labor movement's support for granted.
</P>
<P>
   ''The Democratic Party cannot win an election nationally without
the labor vote,'' Nader said. But Democrats have ignored labor
because ''they think organized labor has nowhere else to go.''
</P>
<P>
   He called for a repeal of the federal Taft-Hartley Act, which he
said restricted the ability of workers to unionize.
</P>
<P>
   Nader saved most of his venom for Democrats because the
Republicans are so corrupted by big money that they hardly deserved
a mention, he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he did take one stab at Bush, joking that Bush's candidacy
might be unconstitutional.
</P>
<P>
   ''He's nothing more than a giant corporation running for the
presidency, disguised as a person,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader promised to stand up for people forgotten by Democrats and
Republicans corrupted by big business. Any differences between
major-party stances on issues like abortion and environment are
more talk than substance, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ''The two conventions reflected (that) the two parties are
molding into one corporate party wearing two heads with different
makeup,'' Nader said.
</P>
<P>
   Nader, a longtime consumer crusader, has supporters among
environmentalists, labor and foes of the World Trade Organization.
If elected, he said he would end commercial logging in national
forests, and use what he characterized as taxpayer subsidies for
the timber industry to preserve and restore forests -- a move he
said would create more jobs than logging.
</P>
<P>
   He said he favors breaching the four Snake River dams to protect
dwindling salmon runs. Gore has ''waffled'' on the issue, he said,
and ''George W. Bush wouldn't even know where it is.''
</P>
<P>
   A Evans-McDonough telephone poll of 615 Washington state voters
last weekend showed Nader backed by 5 percent. Gore was backed by
44 percent, Bush by 42 percent, and Reform Party Pat Buchanan by 1
percent. The remaining 8 percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   The survey's margin of error was plus or minor 4 percentage
points.

<HEADLINE> Clinton, Lazio swap tax plan attacks  </HEADLINE>
By FRANK ELTMAN
<TEXT>
<P>
   NYACK, N.Y. (AP) - U.S. Senate opponents Hillary Rodham Clinton
and Rick Lazio spent Saturday bashing each other's tax plans, with
the first lady condemning his proposal as ''risky'' and the
congressman blasting hers as bad for New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the campaign trail in Rockland County with her
mother, dismissed Lazio's plan as ''fiscally irresponsible ...
risky, irresponsible, imprudent.''
</P>
<P>
   ''The numbers don't add up,'' she said after addressing a
gathering of several hundred women on the 80th anniversary of
women's suffrage in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, in turn, defended his proposal while condemning the
Clinton plan.
</P>
<P>
   ''Mrs. Clinton doesn't trust New Yorkers and believes only
Washington bureaucrats know how to spend our hard-earned money,''
he said in a statement issued by his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a new Zogby poll, to be printed in the New York
Post's Sunday edition, showed the first lady drawing up to a
statistical dead heat with Lazio. The poll shows Clinton leading
Lazio 47 percent to 45 percent among the 601 likely voters polled
last week. The poll has a margin of error of 4.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio unveiled a sweeping $776 billion, 10-year tax-cut plan on
Thursday, aimed at countering proposals offered earlier by the
first lady. It was his first major policy proposal since announcing
his candidacy for U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   For several months, Clinton has touted her own program that
includes grants and targeted tax cuts to stimulate the economy,
particularly in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the Lazio plan ''is not going to give one penny to
paying down the national debt, or preserving Social Security, or
providing a prescription drug benefit for Medicare - all of which I
have advocated.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio, noting that the current surplus is about $4.4 billion,
said his plan would return some of that money to ''the families
that built that surplus with their hard-earned tax dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   While in Lake Placid, to speak to a Kiwanis Club convention,
Lazio told reporters that he felt he had the edge over Clinton
because voters ''want someone who can work well with others and can
get the job done and can reflect their values. I think a lot of
people simply want to make a statement about trust and integrity
and I think this is their opportunity to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   In his brief speech to ''fellow Kiwanians'' Lazio noted that his
father and uncle were both leaders of Kiwanis clubs on Long Island
and that he was a member of the club in Lindenhurst that his father
helped found. Lazio didn't talk politics but only about the service
work that Kiwanis does.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, while Clinton campaigned in Rockland County, her
campaign manager appeared at Lazio's Manhattan headquarters with an
oversized calculator and a complaint: he said the congressman's tax
plan doesn't add up.
</P>
<P>
   Citing a story in the Daily News, one from the Washington Post,
and various studies by congress, Bill de Blasio said the cuts Lazio
wants would sap more than $1 trillion dollars from federal coffers
over 10 years. Lazio has put the cost at $776 billion.
</P>
<P>
   ''It's obvious he needs some help doing the math,'' de Blasio
said. ''That huge difference needs to be explained to New
Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio spokesman Dan McLagan said the discrepancies between their
numbers and Clinton's arise because the two sides are calculating
the costs of proposals that sound similar, but aren't.
</P>
<P>
   ''They're wrong and they know it,'' McLagan said of the Clinton
campaign assertions.

<HEADLINE> Expos 5, Astros 4  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTREAL (AP) -- Dustin Hermanson took a shutout into the ninth
inning for the second straight start, and Jose Vidro hit his 21st
homer as the Montreal Expos barely snapped a nine-game home losing
streak with a 5-4 win over the Houston Astros on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson (10-11), who came within one strike of pitching a
shutout in his last start, allowed eight hits and one walk before
leaving after Moises Alou's one-out RBI single in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Kline came in and gave up an infield single to
pinch-hitter Chris Truby and Tony Eusebio followed with a three-run
double. Eusebio had two hits to extend his career-best hitting
streak to 22 games, one short of the team record.
</P>
<P>
   Kline then retired Tim Bogar and pinch-hitter Mitch Meluskey for
his 14th save. The Expos stopped a four-game losing streak.
</P>
<P>
   Vidro homered off Jose Lima (5-15) in the fourth to break Mike
Lansing's 1997 team record for home runs by a second baseman.
Vidro's homer was the 39th allowed by Lima, who gave up just five
hits in seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   Montreal added four runs in the eighth off reliever Marc Valdes
on Milton Bradley's RBI double, Vidro's run-scoring single,
Vladimir Guerrero's RBI triple and an RBI single by Geoff Blum.
</P>
<P>
   The Expos, who went 0-7 on their last homestand, won for just
the second time in their last 15 games at Olympic Stadium. Montreal
has won just seven of its last 31 games overall.
</P>
<P>
   Hermanson gave up three runs and struck out seven, including
Jeff Bagwell three times.
</P>
<P>
   He allowed only one runner to reach second in the first eight
innings. Julio Lugo and Bagwell opened the ninth with singles
before Alou singled with one out.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who won 21 games last season, had not allowed fewer than
two earned runs in each of his 26 previous starts this season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: Eusebio has raised his average from .203 to .276 over the
course of the streak, going 31-for-80 (.388). Art Howe set the
Astros' record when he hit in 23 consecutive games in 1981, and
Luis Gonzalez tied it in 1997. ... Bagwell has 30 RBIs in August
and needs one more to tie the team record for RBIs in one month.
Bagwell and Derek Bell set the record with 31 RBIs in July 1995 and
Bagwell tied it in May 1996. ... Guerrero started in right field
for the Expos for the first time since last Monday in Los Angeles.
Guerrero missed four starts with a strained left shoulder. ... The
Expos' team record for consecutive home losses is 12, set by the
first edition of the Expos who lost 12 straight at Jarry Park in
1969.

<HEADLINE> Giuliani aide setting up fund-raising committee to help Lazio  </HEADLINE>
By MARC HUMBERT
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) - The head of New York City Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani's aborted U.S. Senate campaign against Hillary Rodham
Clinton is setting up a fund-raising committee to help the first
lady's new Republican challenger, Rep. Rick Lazio, a mayoral
adviser said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the
independent committee being created by Bruce Teitelbaum was
expected to raise more than $2.5 million in the coming weeks, money
that could be used just before Election Day to pay for television
ads aimed at boosting Republican turnout in what is expected to be
a close race.
</P>
<P>
   The adviser said the committee, which has yet to be formally
established, has the support of Giuliani, who left the Senate race
in mid-May to battle prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is one of the ways we can be helpful,'' the Giuliani
adviser said.
</P>
<P>
   Under Teitelbaum's plans, the independent committee would raise
money by tapping into the mayor's Senate donor base. It contributed
more than $23 million to the mayor's Senate campaign. Contributions
to the new committee would come in the form of unlimited soft-money
donations. That means the money couldn't be used for ads that
directly advocate voting for Lazio, but could be used for ones that
seek to boost Republican turnout or that promote the congressman
from Long Island or attack the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   ''I have nothing to say about that,'' Teitelbaum, Giuliani's
Senate campaign manager, said Saturday when asked about the new
committee, first reported in The New York Times.
</P>
<P>
   A downside for Lazio is that he has been attacking Clinton for
her aggressive soft-money fund-raising activity. That means the
Lazio camp will likely keep its distance, at least publicly, from
the Teitelbaum effort.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio campaign spokesman Dan McLagan said Saturday that he knew
nothing about the Teitelbaum effort.
</P>
<P>
   Later, at an appearance in Lake Placid, where he attended his
second fund-raiser of the day and spoke to a Kiwanis convention,
Lazio said ''they have nothing to do with our campaign at all.''
</P>
<P>
   ''I can only say this, if Mrs. Clinton was willing to swear off
soft money - and they seem to be addicted to soft money, so I'm not
sure they're going to so this - I would be willing to tell all
outside groups, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' if she was willing to do
the same,'' the congressman added.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Giuliani has refunded about $2.8 million to donors to
his Senate campaign, accompanied by letters asking that the money
be sent on to Lazio. That is expected to be helpful to the
congressman because many of the donors who contributed to Giuliani
did so not so much because they supported him, but because they
wanted to block Clinton's election to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor still has more than $3 million in his campaign bank
account. Teitelbaum said Saturday that no decision has yet been
made about what to do with that money.
</P>
<P>
   As of the end of June, the Clinton campaign had collected almost
$19 million while Lazio had raised about $8.5 million for the race.

<HEADLINE> Little League WS Reaction  </HEADLINE>
By MARY LEE GRANT
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELLAIRE, Texas (AP) -- The boys of Bellaire are still hometown
heroes even though they lost the world championship on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Bellaire Little League All-Stars, called ''The Boys of
Summer,'' by their suburban Houston supporters, lost to Venezuela
3-2 in Williamsport, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   As the Venezuelan players fell upon each other in a celebratory
hug, Bellaire residents stood before a large screen TV in their
community center to cheer proudly for their defeated team.
</P>
<P>
   While die-hard fans watched the final inning, bored little girls
stood outside and whispered about crushes they had developed on the
players. Little boys ran around the community center creating bases
out of chairs, walls and tables dreaming of becoming the next Chuck
Knoblauch or Jose Cruz Jr., major leaguers who once played for
Bellaire High School.
</P>
<P>
   Teen-agers lounged at the back of the dark gym in lawn furniture
or stretched out on beach blankets. Some sat on bean bag baseballs,
unloaded from an old Mercedes.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are so proud of them to have gone so far,'' said Mandy
Nathan, a Houston attorney. ''It is a real accomplishment for a
town as small as Bellaire.''
</P>
<P>
   Residents say their sense of community is a greater prize than
any baseball trophy. The boys have brought the town's closeness
into the national spotlight, but it existed long before the
12-year-olds made headlines.
</P>
<P>
   ''The community support was here before,'' resident Cathy Riggs
said. ''I think that is why they have gone this far.''
</P>
<P>
   This city of about 14,000, was long ago surrounded by its
behemoth neighbor Houston's southwestward expansion. That proximity
to Houston's main business centers caused Bellaire's property
values to skyrocket since the mid-1980s oil bust, yet the downtown
area still retains a small-town feel.
</P>
<P>
   Two-story Georgian-style houses dot the city, which proudly
proclaims its parks among the nation's safest, and posts photos of
its purple-suited swim team, the Bellaire Barracudas, in city
buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire resident Herv Fisher said he is amazed at the team's
success.
</P>
<P>
   ''They are just little guys,'' Fisher said. ''A lot of them
aren't over 5 feet tall and they are skinny. And they have beaten
kids who are 6-foot-2 and weigh 230 pounds.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellaire is no stranger to baseball glory. The city's high
school, part of the Houston school district, last year tied South
San Antonio's record of seven state championships.
</P>
<P>
   With its defeat, Bellaire failed to join the Houston National
All-Stars of 1950 and Westbury of 1966 as the only local teams to a
win a world title.

<TEXT>
<P>
	   CHATHAM TOWNSHIP, N.J. (AP) - Police arrested a 54-year-old
Chatham Township woman for allegedly killing her elderly parents.
</P>
<P>
   Idella ''Kathleen'' Hagen reported the death of her parents to
police early Saturday morning, according to the Morris County
prosecutor's office. When officers arrived at the home, they found
the bodies of 86-year-old James Hagen and 92-year-old Idella F.
Hagen in separate beds in their bedroom.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities determined that the parents had been dead for
several days, the prosecutor's office said, and a medical examiner
indicated the bodies showed signs of asphyxiation.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Hagen, who has lived with her parents since
July, and charged her with two counts of murder. The prosecutor's
office said Hagen is a licensed medical doctor who specialized in
urology. She did not establish a practice in the area.
</P>
<P>
   Hagen has been remanded to the Morris County Correctional
Facility in lieu of bail.
</P>
<P>
   Capt. Christopher Linne says police are still investigating.

<HEADLINE> New poll shows Clinton and Lazio in statistical dead heat  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	   NEW YORK (AP) - A new poll shows that Hillary Rodham Clinton and
Rep. Rick Lazio are in a statistical dead heat among likely voters
in this year's Senate race.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also shows Vice President Al Gore with a commanding New
York state lead over Texas Gov. George W. Bush in the presidential
race.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, to be published in Sunday's edition of the New York
Post, was conducted by Zogby International for the Post and Fox 5
News.
</P>
<P>
   It shows the first lady leading Lazio 47 percent to 45 percent
among the 601 people who were polled on Thursday and Friday, with a
margin of error of 4.1 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   Gore leads Bush by a solid 20 points, 54 percent to 34 percent,
the poll found.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the poll represent an improvement for Clinton in
recent weeks. A Zogby poll conducted for the Post last month showed
the first lady trailing Lazio 42 percent to 50 percent, with a four
percentage point error margin.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton campaign was pleased with the upswing in the first
lady's numbers, and anticipated that it would continue.
</P>
<P>
   ''We are confident that as New Yorkers continue to focus on the
differences between Hillary and her opponent, that gap will
continue to widen,'' said campaign spokeswoman Cathie Levine.
</P>
<P>
   Lazio was also positive about the results.
</P>
<P>
   ''I feel great about that,'' he said of the poll. ''I just think
considering the post-convention bounce and the millions of dollars
in soft-money attack ads that have been aimed at me over the last
few weeks, to be where we are is good news for our campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio declined to speak at the Republican National Convention
and was not offered a prime-time slot by the Republicans. He spent
only one day at the convention. Clinton spent four days in Los
Angeles at the Democratic National Convention, and had a prime-time
speech on opening night.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll shows Clinton regaining ground among Jewish voters
after a decline last month. The poll has Clinton leading Lazio
among Jews, 55 percent to 33 percent, which is similar to her
showing in polls prior to last month. In last month's Zogby poll,
she had dropped to 48 percent, compared to his 36 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom holds that a Democratic Senate candidate
must capture at least 60 percent of the Jewish vote to win.
</P>
<P>
   The new poll also finds that Lazio continues to lead Clinton
upstate, 51 percent to 40 percent, and still holds a strong lead in
the suburbs with 55 percent support to Clinton's 37 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has 70 percent support in New York City and 96 percent
support among black voters, the poll said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite marked improvement in most categories of the poll,
Clinton is still viewed unfavorably by 45 percent of those polled,
compared to 31 percent for Lazio.

<HEADLINE> Tigers 8, Twins 2  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- Steve Sparks won his fifth straight decision
and Deivi Cruz and Damion Easley homered as the Detroit Tigers beat
the Minnesota Twins 8-2 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Juan Gonzalez had three hits and drove in a run and Shane Halter
also homered as the Tigers improved to 64-64, just the third time
this season they have been at the .500 mark.
</P>
<P>
   Sparks (5-2) throwing his knuckleball at speeds clocked as slow
as 56 mph, went 7 1-3 innings and allowed two runs on five hits. He
walked four and struck out six to continue a winning streak that
began with a 4-3 victory over the Twins on Aug. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Milton (12-7) allowed two earned runs in six innings. He
lost for the first time since July 19, having gone 4-0 in six
starts in that span.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Jack Cressend made his major league debut, replacing
Milton in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Two errors by Minnesota third baseman Corey Koskie and Cruz's
three-run homer helped the Tigers break it open in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   It was 2-all when Bobby Higginson led off with a walk. After
Gonzalez popped out, Koskie made throwing errors on grounders hit
by Dean Palmer and Wendell Magee to give Detroit a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Cruz followed with his seventh homer, giving the Tigers a 6-2
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Detroit added a run in the seventh against Cressend. Higginson
was given credit for a triple when his fly ball was lost in the
roof by left fielder Jacque Jones, and Gonzalez singled through a
drawn-in infield.
</P>
<P>
   Brad Ausmus led off the Tigers third with a single and came home
when Easley snapped a 1-for-16 slump with his 11th home run.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Pierzynski, who is 6-for-7 this season against Detroit,
doubled in the bottom half and scored on Jay Canizaro's two-out
single. The Twins loaded the bases, but David Ortiz grounded out.
</P>
<P>
   Pierzynski struck again in the fourth inning. With two out,
Jones singled and Pierzynski tripled past a diving Magee in right
field, tying it at 2.
</P>
<P>
   Halter homered in the ninth off reliever Eddie Guardado.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Tigers announced that right-hander Adam Bernero (0-1,
4.34) will start in Sunday's series finale instead of Jeff Weaver.
Weaver will open the team's three-game series at Baltimore on
Tuesday. ... Gonzalez has hits in 17 of his last 18 games. ...
While Pierzynski hits the Tigers well, he is just 1-for-21 against
the rest of the AL this year.

   ATHENS, Greece (AP) -- Gusting winds have dropped off, helping
firefighters contain major blazes that killed seven people and
razed dozens of homes in Greece this week, authorities said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Fire chief Panagiotis Fourlas said firefighters had gained the
upper hand at the Albanian border and in southern Arcadia province,
the scenes of the worst destruction. Following an appeal for
international assistance, a 60-member fire crew from Israel joined
the effort Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Greece has had its worst fire season in decades this summer.
Hundreds of fires have broken out around the country, helped by
successive heat waves and strong winds. Up to 370,500 acres of
forest have been blackened.
</P>
<P>
   Seven people were killed in northern Greece on Thursday and
Friday, bringing the summer death toll to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Fourlas said he expected hot and windy weather conditions to

   CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines and its pilots reached a tentative agreement
today in a contract dispute that forced the world's largest airline to cancel or

   SEATTLE (AP) -- Green Party presidential hopeful Ralph Nader said today that
last fall's World Trade Organization protests were a watershed in American
history, and he hopes the same populist wave responsible carries him to the

told 300 people jammed into the Seattle Labor Temple. ''This is an all-purpose
social justice movement.'' Nader also endorsed state Insurance Commissioner
Deborah Senn for U.S. Senate before visiting the labor hall, where he told
supporters the Democratic Party has taken the labor movement's support for

Clinton Lauds Nigeria Democracy

   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) --Standing in the cavernous National Assembly chamber,
President Clinton asked leaders of this oil-rich nation Saturday to set aside
political acrimony so that their citizens can lift themselves from poverty and
isolation. Clinton praised President Olusegun Obasanjo's leadership in
stabilizing Nigeria and told lawmakers they must develop a better working
relationship if their nation is to surmount ''the wrongs and errors of the
past.'' Obasanjo won office last year after death removed Nigeria's dictator,
Gen. Sani Abacha, from power and led to a quick turn to democracy.

four women, on Sunday.

overtime. Swoopes' 31 points set a career playoff high.

<P>
   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Bandits with wooden truncheons
bludgeoned and killed a Spanish woman and her son trekking in a
lower Himalayan region in northern India and seriously wounded
their British friend, officials said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The unidentified attackers assaulted the Spaniards and threw
their bodies into a gorge Friday when they were camping in the
Parvati Valley, police said. The attack came in a remote and
thickly forested area famous for its sulphur springs, a police
spokesman in Kullu, the largest town in the region, told The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   The Spanish news agency Efe identified the slain Spaniards as
Maria Angeles Girones, 34, and her son Cristobal, 14. The Spanish
foreign ministry said the two were apparently from Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   State police chief A.K. Puri identified the Briton as Martin
Young, Press Trust of India reported. The news agency said Young
was being treated at a hospital in the mountain resort of Kullu,
225 miles north of India's capital, New Delhi, in mountainous
Himachal Pradesh state.
</P>
<P>
   The police spokesman said the deserted valley where the trekkers
were attacked is a two-day trip from the nearest small town,
Manikaran. The trekkers had ventured alone into the remote area and
were not accompanied by porters or guides, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Few other details were immediately available.
</P>
<P>
   A German tourist was killed in the Hanta Pass area in the same
district last month.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Man Held in Mexico  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY (AP) -- A man accused of torturing political
prisoners during Argentina's military dictatorship can be held for
60 days while Spanish officials proceed with an extradition
request, a federal judge ruled Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Ricardo Miguel Cavallo was being detained in a Mexico City
prison under the order from federal Judge Jesus Guadalupe Luna, the
federal attorney general's office said.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling came a day after police identified Cavallo as the man
accused of torturing people at the infamous Navy Mechanical School
in Argentina during the military dictatorship, which ended in 1983.
Spanish Judge Baltasar Garzon, who is investigating human rights
abuses under the former military dictatorships of Chile and
Argentina, has accused Cavallo of torture, terrorism, car theft and
forgery.
</P>
<P>
   At least 9,000 Argentines vanished during the country's
seven-year military dictatorship. Human rights groups put the
figure closer to 30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo's arrest came after five former political prisoners
identified him as their alleged torturer, Miguel Angel Cavallo.
Interpol said Cavallo used the name Miguel Angel while in the army.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo has admitted to serving in Argentina's military but has
denied the charges against him. In Buenos Aires on Saturday,
mothers of people who disappeared during the dictatorship demanded
his extradition to Spain, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
   Cavallo had been serving as director of Mexico's private
National Registry of Motor Vehicles. After he was arrested, the
company announced his replacement and urged authorities to
investigate his identity.

<HEADLINE> Cardinals 6, Braves 3  </HEADLINE>
By GEORGE HENRY
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA (AP) -- Will Clark homered twice and Garrett Stephenson
scattered seven hits over 6 2-3 innings as the St. Louis Cardinals
beat the Atlanta Braves 6-3 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Clark, acquired in a July 31 trade with Baltimore, has seven
homers as with St. Louis -- five coming against the Braves -- and 16
this season.
</P>
<P>
   He led off the second with a homer to make it 1-0, added an RBI
double in the third and another solo shot in the fifth as St. Louis
broke out to a 5-0 lead. Clark, who has 10 hits in his last 16
at-bats, has 13 multihomer games in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson (15-7) did not allow a run until Rafael Furcal's
sacrifice fly in the seventh. He was replaced by Matt Morris with
two outs in the seventh and the bases loaded.
</P>
<P>
   Morris needed just two pitches to get Chipper Jones to fly out
to end the threat.
</P>
<P>
   St. Louis, which has won eight of 11 games, will try Sunday to
win its first season series against the Braves since 1994. Each
team has three wins apiece this year.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson walked three and struck out two to move past teammate
Darryl Kile for third-most victories in the NL. Stephenson, who has
won four straight decisions, entered the season with 14 wins in
four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Stephenson pitched a five-hitter in a 5-0 win over the Braves
Aug. 5 in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   One out after Clark's first homer off Kevin Millwood (8-9), Ray
Lankford made it 2-0 with his 20th homer. Edgar Renteria followed
with a single and scored on Mike Matheny's RBI double for a 3-0 St.
Louis lead.
</P>
<P>
   Millwood, who lost for the first time since July 9 at Boston,
gave up seven hits and five runs in six innings. He was 3-0 with
five no-decisions in eight starts since the Red Sox beat him 7-2.
</P>
<P>
   The Braves had won Millwood's six previous starts.
</P>
<P>
   Placido Polanco made it 6-1 in the eighth with an RBI double
against Stan Belinda.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta scored twice in the ninth on an RBI groundout by Furcal
and a run-scoring double by Andruw Jones.
</P>
<P>
Notes: In getting his first multihomer game since Aug. 28, 1998,
Clark improved his career average in five games at Turner Field to
.500 (11-for-22). ... Millwood has not been over .500 since May 17,
when he beat San Francisco to raise his record to 4-2. ... Fernando
Vina went 0-for-4, ending a career-best 17-game hitting streak. ...
Fernando Tatis struck out four times, three against Millwood.

<P>
   WASHINGTON (AP) -- D.C. United forward Raul Diaz Arce scored the
game-winning overtime goal in the 94th minute to beat the Miami
Fusion 2-1 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Bobby Convey sent a long pass down the center of the
field intended for Diaz Arce, but he was being shielded from the
ball by Miami defender Tyrone Marshall. However, as the ball
reached the edge of the penalty area, Marshall and Fusion
goalkeeper Nick Rimando collided, leaving the ball and Diaz Arce
untouched to score the game-winner, his fifth of the season.
</P>
<P>
   With D.C. trailing 1-0 in the 73rd minute, midfielder Nelson
Vargas failed to clear A.J. Wood's shot from just outside the
penalty area. The deflection went straight up, allowing Pete Marino
to volley his second goal of the year behind Rimando.
</P>
<P>
   Former D.C. forward Roy Lassiter needed just 37 seconds to net
the fastest goal in Miami history, gathering a deflected pass from
Martin Machon inside the six-yard penalty box to score his eighth
goal of the year. Machon has an assist in five straight games.
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, Miami (10-13-5, 35 points) trails the Columbus
Crew by three points for eighth place in MLS standings. The top
eight teams reach the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The United (7-16-6, 27 points) must win one of their final three
games to avoid finishing the season with the fewest number of wins
in an MLS season.

<HEADLINE> Diamondbacks 5, Mets 1, 10 Innings  </HEADLINE>
By IRA PODELL
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK (AP) -- Luis Gonzalez's RBI double sparked a four-run
10th inning against Rick White as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the
New York Mets 5-1 Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona cut San Francisco's lead in the NL West to 2&AMP;frac12; games and
the Mets' wild card advantage to 4&AMP;frac12;. The Diamondbacks snapped their
six-game losing streak at Shea Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Jay Bell hit a ground-rule double to left with one out in the
10th off White (2-1) before Gonzalez sent a shot over the head of
center fielder Jay Payton.
</P>
<P>
   After Matt Williams lined out, Steve Finley was walked
intentionally. Greg Colbrunn followed with a double that scored
Gonzalez and Finley to make it 4-1. Damian Miller singled in
Colbrunn to finish the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Plesac (3-0) pitched a perfect ninth for the victory. Matt
Mantei got the final three outs in a non-save situation.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Piazza, who absorbed a thunderous blow from Bell in a home
plate collision in the fourth, hit Brian Anderson's 1-2 pitch two
innings later into the left-center field bleachers for his 33rd
homer of the season to make it 1-0. He had three of the Mets' five
hits and Mike Bordick had the other two.
</P>
<P>
   Bell opened the fourth with a triple off the base of the
center-field fence. Gonzalez followed with a fly to medium-center
that Payton caught.
</P>
<P>
   Payton fired a one-hop strike into Piazza's glove as Bell
charged in. Bell struck Piazza in the face with his right forearm,
sending the catcher backward still in possession of the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The fans chanted ''MVP! MVP!'' as Piazza was attended to by the
trainer and manager Bobby Valentine.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona made it 1-all in the seventh on David Dellucci's
pinch-hit RBI single. With two outs, Miller doubled, Danny Bautista
walked and Dellucci hit a soft liner to center.
</P>
<P>
   Bobby J. Jones and Anderson were locked in a duel until Piazza's
sixth-inning homer. Dellucci batted for Anderson, who worked six
innings and allowed one run on four hits. Jones, in seven innings,
allowed one run and seven hits.
Notes: Mets LF Benny Agbayani flied out to center, leading off the
first, to snap his streak of reaching base in 10 straight plate
appearances. ... Anderson, the NL leader with a 1.5 walks per nine
inning ratio, issued his only two bases on balls in the fourth. ...
Jones is 0-for-33 at the plate this season. ... Williams has not
driven in a run in 34 at-bats.

<HEADLINE> Men Convicted in Brazil Massacre  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) -- Two squatters were convicted of
manslaughter Saturday for the deaths of two policemen in one of
Brazil's bloodiest land disputes, local media reported.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in Porto Velho, capital of the Amazon state of Rondonia,
sentenced Claudenir Gilberto Ramos to eight years in prison and
Cicero Pereira Leite to six years after the men were found guilty
by a seven-member jury, the Estado News Agency reported. Both are
free pending appeal, the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   Outside the courthouse, 200 demonstrators, including church and
union leaders, protested the politically charged decision, which
they said was unfair. They were ringed by police in riot gear.
</P>
<P>
   The deaths occurred during a 1995 incident: 300 police stormed a
squatters' camp, tossing tear gas and firing wildly in the southern
Amazon town of Corumbiara, 1,800 miles northwest of Rio de Janeiro.
The clash left the two police officers and 10 squatters dead.
</P>
<P>
   Autopsy reports later showed that of the 10 squatters killed,
seven were shot point blank in the face, neck, chest and back. One
victim was shot 19 times. Another was shot 12 times in the face.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the police argued they were met with gunfire as they
arrived to carry out an eviction order.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the two squatters, 13 police officers are being
tried in connection to the massacre.
</P>
<P>
   In a trial a week ago, two officers were sentenced to 16 years
and 18 years for murder for their role in the massacre, while a
third was acquitted. In a second trial, two officers were
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In the case that ended Saturday, there was no direct evidence
linking Leite or Ramos to the shots that killed the two officers.
But prosecutors argued that the two organized armed groups within
the squatter camp to resist police raids.
</P>
<P>
   The protesters contend that there was less evidence against the
two squatters than against the police who were acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   Unequal land distribution is at the root of rural violence in
Brazil, where 90 percent of the land belongs to 20 percent of the
people and the poorest 40 percent own just 1 percent of the land.
Over the past decade more than 1,000 people have lost their lives
in land disputes here, according to the Land Pastoral, a Catholic
group that advocates land reform.

<HEADLINE> Ingrassia Wins Yonkers Trot  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
   YONKERS, N.Y. (AP) -- Jacqueline Ingrassia guided Goalfish
through the stretch to overtake Approved Action and become the
first female driver to win the Yonkers Trot, the second leg of the
Triple Crown, at Yonkers Raceway on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Goalfish caught Approved Action, who took the lead at the
three-quarter mile pole midway through the stretch to win by a head
in 1:59.
</P>
<P>
   Approved Action, the favorite with Rejean Daigneault driving,
was outside for the entire race until going on top in 1:28.9 at the
three-quarter pole. But Goalfish wore him down in the stretch.
Brumal Hanover, with Ron Pierce, was third.
</P>
<P>
   ''I fell in early and took a shot at Approved Action,'' said
Ingrassia, who is 3-1-0 in 11 starts with the 3-year-old bay colt.
''It paid off.
</P>
<P>
   ''This was a dream come true made possible by his perfect
trip.''
</P>
<P>
   Goalfish, who did not race as a 2-year-old, earned $172,702 for
the victory to boost his winnings to $202,511.
</P>
<P>
   The winner returned $28.20, $10.20 and $4.70. Approved Action
paid $3.30 and $2.60 and Brumal Hanover $2.40.
</P>
<P>
   Goalfish, trained by Ingrassia's husband, Frank, is not entered
in the Kentucky Futurity, the third leg of the Triple Crown, on
Oct. 9 in Lexington, Ky.
</P>
<P>
   ''My husband and I are just good horse people and we work hard
at what we do,'' Jacqueline Ingrassia said. ''There is a
possibility that we will supplement him into the Kentucky Futurity.
We should know in a day or two.''
</P>
<P>
   There will be no Triple Crown winner because Yankee Paco, winner
of the Hambletonian, opted to race in the American National at
Balmoral in Crete, Ill., on Saturday.

United, Pilots Reach Settlement
</SUBHEAD>
<P>
   CHICAGO (AP) -- United Airlines and its pilots reached a tentative agreement
today in a contract dispute that forced the world's largest airline to cancel or
delay thousands of flights. The two sides met around-the-clock over the past two
days, guided by the National Mediation Board. The key issues remaining in the
talks were security and pay. A spokesman for the pilots would not provide any
details of the agreement, which he said is retroactive to April 12. The
agreement will be presented to the pilots next month.

   NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- Bandits with wooden truncheons bludgeoned and killed
a Spanish woman and her son trekking in a lower Himalayan region in northern
India and seriously wounded their British friend, officials said Saturday. The
unidentified attackers assaulted the Spaniards and threw their bodies into a
gorge Friday when they were camping in the Parvati Valley, police said. The
attack came in a remote and thickly forested area famous for its sulphur
springs, a police spokesman in Kullu, the largest town in the region, told The
Associated Press.

   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) -- Calling Nigeria ''a pivot point on which all Africa's
future turns,'' President Clinton appealed to the leaders of this oil-rich
nation Saturday to set aside political acrimony so that their citizens can lift
themselves from poverty and isolation. Standing in the cavernous National
Assembly chamber Clinton praised President Olusegun Obasanjo's leadership in
stabilizing Nigeria. One of Clinton's purposes in coming was to encourage a
tender democracy to take root here in Africa's most populous nation.

West, potential evacuation plans were ready for two small towns threatened by a
blaze in Washington. The Bitterroot Valley fire and the Mussigbrod fires in the

last fall's World Trade Organization protests were a watershed in American

White House. ''The beautiful aspect of it is, it didn't end in Seattle,'' Nader
told 300 people jammed into the Seattle Labor Temple. ''This is an all-purpose
social justice movement.'' Nader also endorsed state Insurance Commissioner
Deborah Senn for U.S. Senate before visiting the labor hall, where he told
supporters the Democratic Party has taken the labor movement's support for
granted.

Comets' final 36 points. Cooper hit a 3-pointer with 21 seconds to play that

playoff high.

<HEADLINE> Notes from Saturday's Baseball Games  </HEADLINE>
By The Associated PressAMERICAN LEAGUE:
Devil Rays-Orioles:
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA BAY: Tanyon Sturtze pitched two innings Saturday before
leaving with a strained oblique muscle. He expects to miss at least
two starts. ... Dave Eiland made his first relief appearance since
April 18. He has been scratched from his scheduled start Tuesday
against Boston. ... Fred McGriff's homer off Sidney Ponson was his
first off a right-hander since July 7.
</P>
<P>
   BALTIMORE: Sidney Ponson gave up two homers Saturday and has
yielded 26 in 26 starts this season. ... The Orioles have 10
complete games, second in the AL behind Toronto (12). ... Mike
Kinkade made his first start in the majors in the nightcap. He
batted seventh and played DH.
Blue Jays-Rangers:
</P>
<P>
   TORONTO: With eight shutout innings against Texas on Friday
night, he has pitched at least eight innings in 11 of his 28
starts. ... Toronto is 15-19 against left-handed starters.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS: With Friday night's 1-0 victory over the Blue Jays, the
Rangers are 45-37 all-time in 1-0 games. The team's last 1-0 win
came against Oakland on July 10, 1998.
Red Sox-Royals:
</P>
<P>
   BOSTON: SS Nomar Garciaparra started Saturday night after
missing three games with a strained left hamstring. ... The game
started at 8:05 p.m. CDT, an hour later than usual, because of the
Eddie Robinson Classic college football game between Iowa and
Kansas State at adjacent Arrowhead Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY: Mike Sweeney, who entered the game with 115 RBIs,
is on pace for a club-record 146. Hal McRae owns the record with
133 in 1982.
Tigers-Twins:
</P>
<P>
   DETROIT: Dave Mlicki, 4-10 this season with Detroit, will make a
rehabilitation start Sunday for West Michigan of the Class A
Midwest League. He has been on the DL since July 23 with severe
sinus infection that required surgery. ... The Tigers are
guaranteed a winning record for August. That gave Detroit three
straight winning months for the first time since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   MINNESOTA: The Twins may be looking for a Triple-A affiliate in
2001. Salt Lake City, the Twins' affiliate in the Pacific Coast
League for the past seven years, has filed a notice with the
National Association indicating the team is interested in getting a
new affiliation. The list of teams seeking new affiliations will be
available publicly Monday. Minnesota's relationship with Buzz owner
Joe Buzas goes back to 1986. At the time, Buzas owned the team in
Portland, moving to Salt Lake City in 1994.
Yankees-Athletics:
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Jose Canseco started Saturday's game in left field,
the first time he's been in the outfield since July 9, 1999, at
Florida as a member of the Tampa Bay Devil Rays. He made six starts
in left field last year. Glenallen Hill was originally scheduled to
start in the outfield, but switched with Canseco when he didn't
feel comfortable. ... David Justice was given the day off to rest
his sore neck. ... 2B Chuck Knoblauch will miss a day or two on his
minor league rehab assignment after getting hit near his left knee
in a Class A game on Friday. ''He just has a bruise,'' manager Joe
Torre said. ''We're going to move him to Columbus so he can see
Triple-A pitching. That will help him get back here faster.'' ...
Former Yankees and A's great Reggie Jackson was a visitor to the
New York clubhouse before the game. ... OF Paul O'Neill was given
an additional day off to rest his sore hip with the Yankees facing
a left-hander. He and Justice are expected to play Sunday. ... OF
Bernie Williams was back in center field for the first time since
Aug. 18, but will likely sit on Sunday, though he said he was
willing to bat right-handed against a right-handed pitcher to help
take the pressure off his sore rib cage. He's hit right-handed
against knuckleballer Tim Wakefield, but never on a consistent
basis against righties ''probably since rookie ball. I'm very
encouraged,'' said Williams. ''When I first hurt it, I thought I'd
be out a month. But when I hit off the tee, I didn't feel any
pain.'' ... Infielder D'Angelo Jimenez was reinstated from the
60-day disabled list and optioned to Triple-A Columbus, where he
has been on a rehab assignment. ... RHP Ramiro Mendoza, on the
disabled list with tendinitis in his right shoulder, threw in the
outfield with Tampa on Saturday. The Yankees are hopeful he might
throw off a mound by early September.
</P>
<P>
   OAKLAND: Manager Art Howe was surprised when informed 1B Jason
Giambi said he wouldn't be able to play in the field the rest of
the year on Friday. ''That's news to me,'' Howe said. ''I haven't
talked to him about that. We'll just wait and see.'' Howe said he
hasn't even talked to team trainers about when Giambi could
possibly return to the field. For his part, Giambi said he would
reassess the situation in two weeks. ''I've had injuries all year.
It's part of the game,'' said Giambi. ''You learn to suck it up and
play.'' ... Former A's star Jose Canseco, now with the Yankees,
said he's impressed by his former club this year. ''They have a lot
of ability and they're winning games tooth and nail,'' said
Canseco, who broke into the majors with the A's in 1985 and spent
parts of nine seasons in two different stints in Oakland. ... The
playing conditions were still poor at Oakland Coliseum two days
after the Oakland Raiders played an exhibition game there. ''The
outfield is very bumpy,'' said Howe. ''It's like a billiards
table.''
White Sox-Mariners:
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: The White Sox moved back James Baldwin (13-5, 4.29),
who was scheduled to start Sunday, until Tuesday night in Oakland.
He missed his last scheduled start last Wednesday night against
Baltimore because of a tired arm. His 13 victories this season
match his career best set in 1998. ... In Baldwin's place, Sean
Lowe (3-1) will pitch for the White Sox on Sunday. ... In Jose
Valentin's career-high 13-game hitting streak, he was 20-for-54
(.370) with six doubles, a triple, two home runs, 12 RBIs and 16
runs scored. ... With their 76-52 record, the White Sox were off to
their best 128-game start since the 1964 White Sox began at 77-51.
</P>
<P>
   SEATTLE: 3B Carlos Guillen was back in the starting lineup
Saturday night after being replaced by David Bell a day earlier.
Guillen's 14 errors in 63 games lead the Mariners. ... DH Edgar
Martinez is hitting .351 (120-for-342) in 99 games at Safeco Field
compared to his average in the Kingdome of .321 (710-for-2,212).
Indians-Angels:
</P>
<P>
   CLEVELAND: RHP Charles Nagy is scheduled to start his second
rehabilitation assignment of the season on Monday with Double-A
Akron. Nagy has been on the DL since undergoing elbow surgery for
bone chips on May 19 and an earlier rehab stint was aborted on June
30 when he developed a bone bruise. ... Chuck Finley, the
winningest pitcher in Angels history, makes his first start as an
Anaheim visitor Sunday. Finley has faced his former team twice this
season in Cleveland, going 1-0 with a 2.13 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   ANAHEIM: Tim Belcher is set to make his first rehab start Sunday
with Single-A Lake Elsinore; the right-hander has been out since
July 3 with a sore elbow. ... Scott Karl, acquired on Tuesday from
Colorado, is expected to start against Toronto Tuesday in his
Angels debut.
NATIONAL LEAGUE:
Dodgers-Cubs:
</P>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES: OF Devon White's pulled quad isn't as bad as first
thought. After originally saying White would be out at least a
week, manager Davey Johnson said Saturday that White will probably
miss only half that time. ''It did pop, but it's not as bad as I
thought it was,'' said White, who kept ice on his leg for most of
Friday night. White blamed the injury on his lack of playing time
this season. After playing in 100 or more games eight of the last
nine years, he's only played 45 games this season. ''It's tough
when your body is used to being in there every day. Then you're
not, that's what happens,'' he said. ... Closer Jeff Shaw saved
both games of Friday's doubleheader, giving him 20 for the season.
He's saved 20 or more in three straight seasons, only the third
Dodger reliever to do so. ... The Dodgers sweep of Friday's
doubleheader was their first since beating the Montreal Expos twice
on July 6, 1992.
</P>
<P>
   CHICAGO: On Aug. 26, 1939, the Cubs and Braves played a
doubleheader in the first televised major league baseball game. Fox
Sports, which broadcast Saturday's game, used the anniversary to
take a look back at how broadcasting has changed through the years,
starting the game in black-and-white. Breaks between innings were
extended to three minutes to accommodate the broadcast. While that
made for a long day for the players, Cubs manager Don Baylor took
it in stride. ''Believe it or not, we work for television,'' he
said. ''It's an entertainment business and we have to look at it
like that.'' ... Rick Aguilera has converted his last nine save
opportunities.
Astros-Expos:
</P>
<P>
   HOUSTON: C Tony Eusebio has raised his average from .203 to .271
over the course of his career-high 21-game hitting streak. Eusebio
was 29-for-76 (.382) over the course of the streak entering
Saturday night's game. Art Howe hit in 23 consecutive games in 1981
to set the Astros' team record, which was tied by Luis Gonzalez in
1997. ... Jeff Bagwell has 30 RBIs in August and needs one more to
tie the team record for most in one month. Bagwell and Derek Bell
set the record with 31 RBIs in July 1995 and Bagwell tied it with
31 in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
   MONTREAL: Vladimir Guerrero started in right field for the first
time since last Monday in Los Angeles. Guerrero missed four starts
with a strained left shoulder. ... The Expos have lost nine
straight at Olympic Stadium and four straight overall. The team
record for consecutive home losses is 12, set by the first edition
of the Expos which lost 12 straight at Jarry Park from May 13-June
24, 1969.
Reds-Marlins:
</P>
<P>
   CINCINNATI: OF Michael Tucker began the weekend batting .346 at
home and .206 on the road. ... The Reds are the only major league
team with a winning record on the road and a losing record at home.
</P>
<P>
   FLORIDA: Jason Stokes, the Marlins' unsigned second-round draft
pick, took batting practice with the team Saturday and helped his
negotiating position by hitting seven home runs. Stokes, who is
from Dallas, plans to enroll next week at the University of Texas
unless he signs. ... SS Alex Gonzalez, recovering from a sprained
knee, will begin a rehabilitation assignment Sunday with Class A
Brevard County.
Rockies-Pirates:
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO: Rookie Juan Pierre, who began his career with a
16-game hitting streak, went 4-for-6 Saturday to jump his average
to .375. He credits part of his early success for watching Todd
Helton, who is batting .393: ''It's helped me a lot just to see
him, I see the approach he takes with every at-bat, the way he
keeps his demeanor the same. How he approaches batting practice is
a good example for anybody.'' ... After getting to .300 on Friday,
Neifi Perez dropped to .299 by going 1-for-4 Saturday. ... The
Rockies are batting .311 (129-for-415) in the last 11 road games.
... Helton is batting .360 on the road.
</P>
<P>
   PITTSBURGH: In 10 career games with father Fred in the opposing
dugout, Jason Kendall is 20-for-40. Fred Kendall, also a former
major league catcher, is a Rockies coach. ... The Pirates are 3-13
in afternoon home games, losing their last nine. They haven't won a
home day game since May 14. ... Adrian Brown was 2-for-5 and now is
18-for-38 (.473) during a nine-game hitting streak. He has nine
hits in his last four games. ... Pirates 1B Kevin Young was retired
at first on an odd play in the ninth inning of Saturday's 11-4 loss
to Colorado. With runners on first and second, Young grounded to
third baseman Jeff Cirillo, who stepped on the bag to retire the
lead runner. Young beat the throw to first, then strolled off the
bag as he saw first base umpire Mike Winters throw up his hands.
Rockies 1B Todd Helton then tagged out Young, who was joined by
manager Gene Lamont in arguing that Winters called time. ... 2B
Warren Morris has played 48 games without an error since making 11
errors in his first 64 games.
Diamondbacks-Mets:
</P>
<P>
   ARIZONA: The Diamondbacks, in second place in both the NL West
and the race for the wild card, are facing an uphill club in their
attempt to return to the postseason. The Mets, the wild card
leaders, have the majors' best record since the All-Star game at
28-14. The Giants, atop the West, have the second best mark of
27-14. ... 1B Greg Colbrunn, who went 2-for-4 in Friday's 13-3 loss
at New York, improved his 2000 average against the Mets to .467
(7-for-15) and his career average against them to .332
(65-for-196). ... Randy Johnson, who didn't record a strikeout in
his 2 1-3-inning outing on Friday, had gone 351 consecutive
appearances and 342 starts since that last happened on April 15,
1989.
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK: Saturday marked the fourth anniversary since Bobby
Valentine took over as Mets manager, replacing the fired Dallas
Green. In that time, Valentine has 361 wins -- second best in team
history to Davey Johnson (595). ... Benny Agbayani, who reached
base in 10 straight plate appearances, flied out to center leading
of the first to end the streak. ... OF Juan LeBron was sent
outright to Class A St. Lucie and RHP Juan Aracena was sent to
Double-A Binghamton. The moves open spaces on the 40-man roster,
creating more flexibility for Sept. 1 callups. The Mets now have 37
players on the 40-man roster. General manager Steve Phillips said
he intends to promote between five and 10 players over the course
of the season's final month. ... RHPs Rick Reed and Bobby Jones,
Saturday's starter, watched the Little League World Series
championship game on television before the game, cheering on the
team from Bellaire, Texas. Bellaire lost 3-2 to Maracaibo,
Venezuela.
Giants-Phillies:
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO: Sunday's starter Mark Gardner will go for his
10th win of the season -- a feat he's accomplished four times in his
career. He's 2-0 with a 0.66 ERA in his last two starts. ... Robb
Nen has converted his last 17 save opportunities and his 215 career
saves is one short of Dave Smith for 23rd place on the all-time
list. ... 1B J.T. Snow needs three hits to reach 1,000 for his ML
career. ... LF Barry Bonds has 25 career homes at Veterans Stadium
- most of any active visiting player.
</P>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA: 1B Travis Lee wasn't in the starting lineup on
Saturday. He's nursing a sore hamstring. ... The Phillies have had
three different pitchers throw complete games this season (Curt
Schilling, Robert Person and Kent Bottenfield). That's the most
since five Phillies hurlers notched complete games in 1993
(Schilling, Tommy Greene, Danny Jackson, Terry Mulholland and Ben
Rivera). ... CF Doug Glanville put together identical back-to-back
11-game hitting streaks. Went 16-for-47 (.340) from July 29 to Aug.
10, went hitless on Aug. 11 and then went 16-for-47 from Aug. 12 to
Aug. 24. ... The Phillies signed their fourth-round draft pick,
Daniel Gonzalez, a switch-hitting shortstop. The team has signed 30
of their 38 selections from the 2000 draft, including each of the
top 14.
Cardinals-Braves:
</P>
<P>
   ST. LOUIS: In losing 7-4 to Tom Glavine on Friday, St. Louis
dropped to 4-14 on the road when facing left-hander starters. ...
RHP Darryl Kile, who will make his 24th career start against
Atlanta on Sunday, is 5-11 lifetime with a 4.12 ERA when facing the
Braves. Kile lost 6-4 to Atlanta on Aug. 6. ... Entering Saturday's
game, CF Jim Edmonds grounds into a double play every 142.3
at-bats, the second-best ratio in the NL. However, he grounded into
his fourth double play of the season in the fifth inning. ... St.
Louis entered the game having grounded into 87 double plays. Only
Florida (76) and Montreal (84) have hit into fewer. ... The
Cardinals are 63-0 when leading after eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   ATLANTA: In the last seven games, Andruw Jones hit .400
(14-for-35) with three homers and eight RBIs. Jones, the only major
leaguer to play every inning of every game this year, has appeared
in 300 straight games, second only to Sammy Sosa (366). ... LHP
Mike Remlinger is 13-2 with 13 saves a 2.40 ERA since Aug. 5, 1999,
an 82-game stretch that includes 93 2-3 innings. In 28 games at
home, Remlinger has 1.17 ERA. In 28 games on the road, his ERA is
4.40. ... 1B Andres Galarraga entered Saturday having hit safely in
26 of 33 games. Starting with a July 6 game against Montreal,
Galarraga has a .327 average (37-for-113) with five homers and 24
RBIs. ... The Braves are 70-3 when leading after eight innings.
Padres-Brewers:
</P>
<P>
   SAN DIEGO: Woody Williams (7-5) makes his 11th start Sunday
since having surgery to repair an aneurysm under his right armpit
on May 4. ... San Diego is 8-0 when rookie OF Mike Darr has two or
more hits in a game. He had his second three-hit effort in the last
four games as the Padres beat Milwaukee 4-0 Friday night. ... With
the victory Friday night, the Padres guaranteed their first winning
month since June 1999.
</P>
<P>
   MILWAUKEE: The Brewers celebrated the efforts of the women who
formed the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League in a
brief ceremony before the game. Commissioner Bud Selig thanked
representatives of 14 teams that played from 1943-54 for their
efforts in popularizing baseball among female fans. They closed the
celebration by forming a ''V'' for victory on the outfield grass as
a remembrance of their support for the soldiers fighting during
World War II. ... Since taking over for closer Bob Wickman who was
traded July 28, Curtis Leskanic has converted all eight chances
into saves. ... Going into Saturday night's home game, Richie
Sexson is batting .356 with five home runs and 15 runs at County
Stadium since joining the Brewers July 28.

beating Moni Maker by 3&AMP;frac12; lengths Saturday in the $390,000 Maple
Leaf Trot at Woodbine Racetrack.
</P>
<P>
   The result was a disappointment for Moni Maker, harness racing's
career money leader with more than $5.2 million, who is in the
midst of a world farewell tour before becoming a broodmare.
</P>
<P>
   Lifetime Memories finished third.
</P>
<P>
   Moni Maker, with Wally Hennessey driving, took the lead at the
half-mile from Corn Cob Conch.
</P>
<P>
   But Magician, driven by Dave Miller, moved up from fifth down
the backstretch and joined Moni Maker at the front turning for home
before pulling away.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Texas (AP) -- Joey Hamilton won for the first time in
more than a year and Shannon Stewart matched his career high with
four hits to lead the Toronto Blue Jays to a 9-3 victory over the
Texas Rangers on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton (1-0) allowed two runs and four hits over six innings
in his second start since undergoing rotator cuff surgery last
Sept. 9.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton, who struck out three and walked one, had a six-inning
no-decision in a 5-1 loss to Minnesota in his previous start. His
last victory was on Aug. 25, 1999, 7-2 at Anaheim.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays have won four of five to remain in the thick of
the AL wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Delgado had two hits, walked twice and had a sacrifice
fly for Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Cruz Jr. had a two-run homer in Toronto's four-run ninth
inning. The Blue Jays got a first-inning solo homer from Alex
Gonzalez.
</P>
<P>
   Hamilton got off to a shaky start, allowing first-inning singles
to Frank Catalanotto and Luis Alicea. Rusty Greer followed with a
sacrifice fly, but Hamilton retired the next two hitters on fly
balls.
</P>
<P>
   The Blue Jays took a 4-1 lead with a three-run second off rookie
Brian Sikorski (1-2), helped by third baseman Mike Lamb's error.
Stewart had an RBI single, Dave Martinez hit a sacrifice fly and
Delgado had a run-scoring double.
</P>
<P>
   Sikorski allowed five runs -- four earned -- and 10 hits over 5
2-3 innings in his third major league start. He struck out two and
walked four.
</P>
<P>
   Catalanotto's leadoff homer in the sixth reduced Toronto's lead
to 5-2. Bill Haselman was credited with an RBI in the seventh to
make it 5-3 when Gabe Kapler scored from third as Haselman reached
on Gonzalez's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   Pedro Borbon pitched two innings for his first save of the
season.
</P>
<P>
Notes: The Rangers hit into an odd double play in the third. Luis
Alicea flied to center with Royce Clayton running on the play.
Clayton rounded second as the catch was made and headed back to
first, but he missed retouching second base and was called out on
appeal. ... Martinez stretched his hitting streak to 16 games. ...
Blue Jays pitching coach Dave Stewart had to be restrained by bench
coach Lee Elia and catcher Alberto Castillo in the dugout before
the top of the eighth. Stewart was arguing with someone in the
Toronto dugout who could not be immediately identified. Stewart had
made a mound visit to reliever John Frascatore in the bottom of the
seventh.

<HEADLINE> Police investigate triple homicide, suicide  </HEADLINE>

<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) - A 29-year-old city man went on a killing
rampage Saturday, gunning down a neighbor, a city firefighter and
the mother of an ex-girlfriend before killing himself, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Although authorities said they had no one clear motive early in
their investigation, they said the gunmen knew all three victims.
He was in an ongoing dispute with his neighbor, and may have shot
his ex-girlfriend's mother to get back at the girlfriend for
breaking off their relationship, police said.
</P>
<P>
   ''It almost appears like it's three separate shootings for three
different reasons,'' said Waterbury Police Superintendent Edward
Flaherty.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting spree began just before 11 a.m. when Mark Cote, got
into an argument with Brian Miller, 30, who lived on the third
floor of the same multiple family home where Cote lived, police
said. Police said Cote and Miller had an ongoing neighbor dispute,
but would not say what they had been arguing about.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Joe Pesce said Cote may have ''snapped'' in the argument
with Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Flaherty said Cote shot Miller as his neighbor sat in his car,
dragged him out and shot him again before fleeing the scene in
Miller's car.
</P>
<P>
   Police said Cote had two weapons, a .25-caliber semiautomatic
handgun and a Tech 9-type automatic pistol.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes after shooting Miller, police said Cote drove a few
miles to the intersection of Highland Avenue and Sunnyside Avenue
where four city firefighters were collecting money from motorists
for the ''Fill The Boot'' campaign for Muscular Dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   Cote shot and killed Jamie Quinones, 38, a city firefighter who
had been with the department for six years, then fled.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 15 minutes after Quinones was gunned down, police
received a 911 call from a home on Kenyon St., but the phone was
quickly hung up. The 911 operator called back and was told by the
man who answered that everyone was O.K. and ''one of the kids must
have been playing with the phone.''
</P>
<P>
   The 911 operator called a second time and Maria Perez, 23,
answered, saying that her ex-boyfriend, Cote, had shot and killed
her mother. Perez broke off her relationship with Cote two weeks
ago, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Police responded to the home and found Miller's car in front
with the engine still running. When police arrived, Perez ran from
the home with her three children and told officers that Cote shot
her mother on the first floor and was now on the second floor of
the house with a gun.
</P>
<P>
   It was at that point that police heard a shot from within the
house, closed off the area and called in the Waterbury Emergency
Response team.
</P>
<P>
   Several attempts were made to contact Cote inside the house by
phone and with a bullhorn, but there was no response, police said.
</P>
<P>
   Officers then entered the house and found Cote dead from a
self-inflicted gunshot wound on the second floor. They found the
body of Maria Hernandez, 40, on the first floor.
</P>
<P>
   Cote's mother said her son did not have a history of violence,
and gave no hints that something was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ''He was perfectly fine this morning...he was on the phone, he
was fine,'' Rachel Cote said. ''He left and then everything
unfolded in the next hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Acting Fire Chief James Trainor described Quinones as ''a nice
guy, kind of quiet, with a military bearing.'' Quinones had spent
11 years in the Marines before become a city firefighter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   By late afternoon firefighters at the Highland Avenue firehouse,
less than a mile from where Quinones was killed, had place black
bunting outside the firehouse.

<P>
   WATERBURY, Conn. (AP) -- A man went on a killing spree Saturday,
gunning down three people, including a firefighter who was
collecting money for charity, before shooting himself to death,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman knew all three victims but authorities hadn't

<HEADLINE> No. 2 Florida State 29, BYU 3  </HEADLINE>
By RICHARD ROSENBLATT
<TEXT>
<P>
   JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- Chris Weinke does more than throw
touchdown passes for No. 2 Florida State -- he runs, blocks and even
knocks over opposing coaches.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke threw two scoring passes and ran 21 yards to set up
another touchdown as the Seminoles opened defense of their national
title with a 29-3 victory over BYU on Saturday night in the Pigskin
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   On Weinke's first TD pass, a 19-yarder to Javon Walker just 2:47
into the season, the quarterback was pushed into BYU's LaVell
Edwards on the sideline and the collision sent the 69-year-old
coach sprawling. It might have been the hardest hit Weinke took all
night at Alltel Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   BYU was overmatched from the start, unable to keep up with
Florida State's new set of speedy receivers featuring Marvin
Minnis, Atrews Bell, Anquan Boldin and Walker. Peter Warrick? Who's
he?
</P>
<P>
   And the Seminoles' defense, anchored by end Jamal Reynolds,
caused one safety, intercepted three passes and sacked BYU
quarterbacks Bret Engemann and Charlie Peterson a total of five
times. The Cougars had 79 yards in the first half -- minus-13
rushing.
</P>
<P>
   BYU barely extended its NCAA record of scoring in consecutive
games to 313 when Owen Pachman kicked a 42-yard field goal with
2:19 left in the third quarter. The Cougars were last shut out in
1975, 20-0 by Arizona State.
</P>
<P>
   The 28-year-old Weinke set career highs for attempts and
completions, going 32-of-50 for 318 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke, who weighed 245 pounds last season, is now a
slimmed-down 229, and after a 3-yard TD pass to Bell and a safety
made it 15-0, he took off on the longest run of his career. Before
the 21-yarder, his previous longest run was 8 yards.
</P>
<P>
   He rolled left, saw running room and outlegged several BYU
defenders before being chased out of bounds at the 6. On the next
play, a double reverse, he threw the block that freed up Bell for
the TD that put the Seminoles in control at 22-0 early in the
second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   BYU, making a rare visit to the East Coast, had little chance
against the much faster Seminoles, who were last seen beating
Virginia Tech in the Sugar Bowl for their second national title and
first perfect season under coach Bobby Bowden.
</P>
<P>
   Weinke now needs 389 yards to become Florida State's career
passing leader, ahead of Gary Huff, who had 6,378 yards from
1970-72. Weinke, among the top Heisman Trophy contenders, has won
22 of 23 games he's started.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State extended its winning streak to 13 games and has
won 22 consecutive regular-season games.
</P>
<P>
   One problem the Seminoles do have is their kicking game.
Sebastian Janikowski, and his accurate leg, is gone and new kicker
Matt Munyon, a redshirt freshman walk-on, missed field-goal
attempts of 34- and 27 yards and an extra point.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State, with a crowd of 54,260 looking on, scored on its
opening drive, with Weinke's first completion of the season a
15-yarder to Minnis helping to set up the TD. Four plays later, the
one in which he was shoved into Edwards, Weinke lofted his TD pass
to Walker from about the 30. It dropped into the receiver's arms
with three BYU defenders around him.
</P>
<P>
   The Seminoles went ahead 13-0 with 3:01 left in the first
quarter as Weinke went 5-of-6 for 46 yards in a 70-yard drive. The
final completion was the 3-yarder to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds helped create the safety late in the first quarter. He
slapped the ball out of Engemann's hands as he dropped back to pass
and the ball bounced back 17 yards into the end zone. Florida
State's Jerel Hudson nearly recovered the ball, which would have
resulted in a TD for the Seminoles, and BYU's Ben Archibald fell on
it for the safety.
</P>
<P>
   Florida State extended the lead to 22-0 thanks to a 17-yard punt
return by Anquan Boldin, yet another wide receiver. Weinke then hit
passes of 9- and 10 yards to Boldin, ran 21 yards to the BYU 6, and
then handed off to Davy Ford, who gave it to Bell, who followed his
quarterback's block into the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   Travis Minor ran 5 yards for a score with 1:11 left to close out
the scoring.
</P>
<P>
   While BYU still hopes to make Edwards' 29th and final season a
winning one, no doubt the coach will not soon forget the hit he and
his team took against Florida State.

   CHICAGO (AP) -- A tentative agreement was reached Saturday in a contract
dispute between United Airlines and its pilots which had forced the world's
largest airline to cancel or delay thousands of flights. The two sides met
around-the-clock over the past two days, guided by the National Mediation Board.
The key issues remaining in the talks were security and pay. A spokesman for the
pilots, Herb Hunter, would not provide any details of the agreement, which he
said is retroactive to April 12. The agreement will be presented to the pilots

the feat since Dale Earnhardt did it in 1987 -- and his ninth career win on the
concrete. Wallace, also the winner last week at Michigan, is the first driver
this season to win in consecutive weeks. More importantly, though, the Ford

into the race in fifth place in the standings, 352 points behind leader Bobby
