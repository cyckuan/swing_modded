Singapore council urges pay cuts to avoid unemployment
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JONATHAN DRAKE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Employers should cut expenses and avoid layoffs
by reducing salaries and contributions to pension funds, the
government-dominated National Wages Council said Thursday.
	   The council recommended 5 percent to 8 percent wage reductions
this year compared to 1997 and cutting employer contributions to
the mandatory state-run pension fund from 20 percent of a worker's
salary to 10 percent.
	   The cuts match recent recommendations from the Ministry of Trade
and Industry and the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.
Government and local companies are widely expected to adopt the
measures.
	   The wage council _ which represents unions, businesses and
government _ said Singapore risks severely damaging the economy
unless it reins in rising labor costs.
	   ``As an export-oriented economy with external demand accounting
for about 70 percent of total demand, preserving our
cost-competitiveness is crucial for economic growth,'' it
cautioned.
	   ``We need to reduce our (labor) cost quickly to tide over the
difficult period, preserve jobs and strengthen our
competitiveness.''
	   Singapore has slipped into a technical recession, its first
downturn since the last economic contraction in the mid-80s. As
exports and business profits have fallen, layoffs have risen to
record levels and unemployment has doubled to 4.5 percent.
	   Reducing wages and other business costs is the only way to
immediately soften the blow, says the government.
	   The council argued that the proposed pay cuts will ``instill
greater confidence among global investors in the Singapore economy,
help companies regain their cost-competitiveness and preserve jobs
and minimize unemployment.''
	   But companies which performed exceptionally well or very poorly
might need to deviate from its suggestions, added the council,
which also urged employers to consider moderating cuts for
lower-income employees.
	   The council also ``strongly recommends that when the economy
recovers, the rate of employers' contribution (to the pension fund)
should be adjusted upward.''
	   Thursday's recommendations are in line with the suggestions from
government-convened Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness on
Wednesday to slash business costs by 10 billion Singapore dollars
(dlrs 6 billion) a year.

Indonesian military chief urges calm in wake of street clashes

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Military chief Gen. Wiranto appealed
for restraint Thursday, a day after clashes pitting student
protesters against riot police and government-backed civilian
guards.
	   Even as he spoke, students gathered for a third day of
demonstrations against a meeting of Indonesia's highest legislative
body, which has pledged to overhaul a rigid political system.
	   Activists are skeptical that the People's Consultative Assembly
is willing to shake off its legacy as an authoritarian instrument
of former President Suharto. The former army general quit in May
after riots and protests against his 32-year rule.
	   Violence erupted on Wednesday when a car carrying student
activists plowed into a group of riot officers, injuring nine and
prompting enraged soldiers to fire warning shots and to club
protesters.
	   Wiranto apologized for the beatings of several protesters and
three local news photographers. Urging restraint on all sides, he
pointed out that the military was not the only culprit.
	   ``Some of my subordinates were victims in the incident,'' he
said at a news conference.
	   The male driver of the car, a student from the prestigious
University of Indonesia, was arrested. His family said he had
panicked and accelerated into a soldiers' barricade after officers
rapped on his car with sticks.
	   At another protest Wednesday, two female students were
hospitalized in serious condition after they were run down by a
car. Privately owned RCTI television quoted witnesses as saying
military personnel were in the vehicle.
	   On Thursday, security forces closed off roads around the
green-domed Parliament, where the assembly is meeting to draw up
rules for general elections in 1999. Some 30,000 police and
soldiers are on duty in the capital this week.
	   President B.J. Habibie, a one-time protege of Suharto who has
legalized political parties and made other democratic reforms,
opened the four-day meeting Tuesday. Critics suspect that Habibie,
who is expected to run for president next year, may be maneuvering
to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the 1,000-member assembly, which includes
parliamentary legislators and presidential appointees, met Thursday
to discuss scaling back the armed forces' prominent role in
politics.
	   Student protesters want the military, which has 75 appointed
seats in the 500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the
chamber.
	   Delegates, many of whom built their careers by loyally serving
Suharto, are also likely to debate demands that the former
president be tried for alleged corruption and human rights abuses.
	   In May, deadly riots erupted across Jakarta when military
personnel shot to death four student protesters. The unrest was
fueled by discontent over Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades.
	   This week, the army said troops had only been issued with blanks
and plastic bullets. But on Tuesday, military-backed civilian
guards carrying sharpened bamboo staves brawled with students and
neighborhood youths in several areas.

Rival factions near breakthrough, urge king to call summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodia's rival political factions,
deadlocked over forming a new government, showed signs of reaching
a breakthrough Thursday by asking King Norodom Sihanouk to convene
a summit so new negotiations can be held.
	   The requests mark a step forward in breaking the impasse since
parliamentary elections were held in July. The opposition's
rejection of the narrow victory by strongman Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party has left Cambodia without a legal
government.
	   Chea Sim, the CPP's president, and Prince Norodom Ranariddh,
Sihanouk's son and leader of the largest opposition party,
FUNCINPEC, made written requests Thursday to the king to host a
summit at the Royal Palace.
	   It was unclear when one could be organized. Sihanouk, 76, is
scheduled to leave Cambodia on Saturday for China, where he is to
undergo a thorough medical checkup and treatment for his numerous
ailments.
	   But the requests signaled a new drive by the CPP and FUNCINPEC _
partners in a tense coalition before Hun Sen ousted Ranariddh as
his co-prime minister in a bloody coup in 1997 _ to revive talks
that have frequently broken down.
	   In the elections, the CPP failed to win a two-thirds majority
that would have enabled it to form a government alone. Ranariddh
and former finance minister Sam Rainsy, the junior opposition
leader, alleged electoral fraud and intimidation and withheld their
support.
	   Both opposition leaders and many of their supporters fled the
country after the new National Assembly was formally sworn in Sept.
24, saying they feared arrests. They dismissed Hun Sen's guarantees
that they would be safe upon return.
	   Sihanouk tried to break the impasse last week, offering the
opposition use of his palace for security and saying royal guards
could escort the leaders to and from the airport.
	   On Wednesday, Hun Sen addressed opposition fears of arrest on
trumped-up charges by saying members of parliament enjoy full
immunity. He predicted a summit would enjoy success under the
king's ``clear-sighted guidance.''
	   Ranariddh said in a letter Thursday to Sihanouk that the safety
guarantees were ``sufficient.'' There was no immediate word from
Sam Rainsy, but his 15 seats are not vital to the formation of a
two-thirds majority in the 122-member assembly.
	   Ranariddh did not say when he and his fellow lawmakers will
return, but asked the king to chair a summit of political leaders
``at the Royal Palace according to a date of your majesty's wish.''
	   Chea Sim, president of Hun Sen's ruling party, suggested in a
letter to Sihanouk that the monarch host a summit in Phnom Penh
before he leaves for Beijing.
	   The two parties have neared agreement on an agenda, proposing
that the issues of selecting leadership in the National Assembly
and a program for a new government be discussed.

Vaughn to leave Boston, Bonilla to Mets, Palmer to Tigers; Cone
</HEADLINE>
stays &QL; 
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ As Bobby Bonilla returned to the New York Mets
and Dean Palmer signed with Detroit, Mo Vaughn said goodbye to the
Boston Red Sox.
	   The slugging first baseman rejected what Boston general manager
Dan Duquette said was the team's last proposal and vowed to play
elsewhere next season.
	   ``They made a last and final offer. It was submitted to Mo
earlier this evening. He did not accept it,'' said Vaughn's agent,
Tom Reich. ``Duquette declared the negotiations over.''
	   Vaughn, the centerpiece of Boston's lineup, rejected a dlrs 37.5
million, four-year deal earlier this year. The Red Sox made a
five-year offer worth about dlrs 60 million, but he already has a
dlrs 72 million, six-year proposal from the Anaheim Angels.
	   '' Who knows if I would have accepted any contract? But
sometimes people don't see eye to eye,'' he told ESPN. ``It's time
to move on. Best of luck to the Boston Red Sox.''
	   On a busy day, David Cone agreed to stay with the New York
Yankees. The pitcher, a 20-game winner for the first time since
1988, was set to reject a dlrs 5.5 million play option and agreed
to an dlrs 8 million, one-year deal. New York and Darryl Strawberry
agreed to delay a decision on his dlrs 2.5 million option until
Nov. 20.
	   In the other big news, Los Angeles sent Bonilla to the Mets
along with dlrs 1 million for reliever Mel Rojas, and Palmer agreed
to a dlrs 36 million, five-year contract with the Tigers.
	   Also, Arizona picked up two free agents, agreeing to a dlrs 5.7
million, three-year contract with left-hander Greg Swindell and a
dlrs 1.8 million, two-year deal with first baseman Greg Colbrunn.
	   Bonilla was largely a bust during 3 1/2 seasons with the Mets
before they exiled him to Baltimore.
	   ``I think Bobby Bonilla's a guy who comes with some risk who
also comes with a lot of reward,'' Mets manager Bobby Valentine
said. ``We certainly hope he is able to play in the outfield. The
risk is whether he catches the ball when it comes down.
	   ``We believe his determination and athleticism is going to allow
him to get in the shape he needs to be in to not only catch it when
it comes down but do the things we need a major league outfielder
to do on an everyday basis.''
	   The switch-hitting Bonilla, hampered by injuries last year, hit
.249 with 11 homers and 45 RBIs in 100 games. He was traded to the
Dodgers on May 15 along with Gary Sheffield, Charles Johnson, Jim
Eisenreich and a minor league pitcher for catcher Mike Piazza and
third baseman Todd Zeile as part of the Florida Marlins' payroll
purge.
	   ``This deal should be beneficial for both teams,'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``Our bullpen needs Mel Rojas
big time. They needed a bat to protect Mike Piazza.''
	   Rojas, 32 next month, was a major disappointment for the Mets
last year, going 5-2 with a 6.05 ERA and two saves in 50 games and
blowing key games against the New York Yankees and Toronto Blue
Jays, among others.
	   Rojas is signed for 1999 at dlrs 4.5 million, while Bonilla gets
dlrs 5.9 million in each of the next two seasons, the reason the
Dodgers are sending cash to New York.
	   Palmer, 30 next month, will be getting a lot of cash. After Ken
Caminiti didn't accept the Tigers' offer, Detroit gave Palmer a
deal that includes a dlrs 10 million signing bonus payable over
five years, dlrs 3 million in 1999, dlrs 5 million in 2000, dlrs
5.5 million in 2001, dlrs 6 million in 2002 and dlrs 6.5 million in
2003.
	   He made dlrs 5.75 million this year, hitting .278 for Kansas
City and leading the Royals in homers (34) and RBIs (119).
	   ``I liked the idea of being with the team moving into a new
stadium,'' said Palmer, the Tigers' first major free-agent addition
since pitcher Tim Belcher in 1994. ``I looked at the talent they
have on the field and there's some great talent. With a couple more
additions, they will be ready go contend.''
	   Cone, 35, was 20-7 with a 3.55 ERA last season as New York set
an AL record with 114 victories and won the World Series.
	   ``I always made it clear that my first choice was the Yankees,''
he said. ``That's where I want to be, where I want to end my
career.''
	   Strawberry is undergoing chemotherapy following surgery last
month to remove a cancerous tumor from his colon. The Yankees
aren't sure when he will be ready to play.
	   Arizona, which wants to sign Randy Johnson, started with two
lesser free agents. Swindell,who will be 34 next season, was a
combined 5-6 with a 3.59 ERA for Minnesota and Boston this year in
81 relief appearances and made dlrs 1.3 million.
	   Colbrunn, 29, hit a combined .307 this year for Colorado and
Atlanta with three homers and 23 RBIs in 166 at-bats.

Devils 3, Canadiens 0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EAST RUTHERFORD, New Jersey (AP) _ Scott Niedermayer scored on a
penalty shot and set up another goal to lead New Jersey to a 3-0
victory Wednesday night over the Montreal Canadiens.
	   Goalie Martin Brodeur stopped 24 shots as the Devils won for the
fifth time in six games and ended the Canadiens' three-game winning
streak.
	   Krzysztof Oliwa and Sergei Brylin joined Niedermayer in scoring
their first goals of the season and stretching New Jersey's
unbeaten streak at home against Montreal to 10 games (8-0-2).
 &UR; Maple Leafs 3, Oilers 2 &QC; 
	   At Toronto, goaltender Curtis Joseph made 32 saves and was
spectacular in the third period to lead Toronto over Edmonton.
	   The Oilers outshot the Leafs 20-2 but could score only once in
Joseph's second win in two games against the Oilers this season.
	   Daniil Markov, Alyn McCauley and Steve Thomas scored in a 3:40
span of the second period for the Leafs, who broke a three-game
winless streak and moved over the .500 mark at 7-6-2.
	   Andrei Kovalenko and Rem Murray replied for the Oilers, who went
0-for-5 on the power play.
 &UR; Panthers 4, Rangers 1 &QC; 
	   At Sunrise, Florida, Ed Jovanovski and Robert Svehla scored
their first goals of the season as Florida beat the New York
Rangers.
	   Jovanovski broke a 1-1 tie by scoring with 21.4 seconds left in
the second period, and Svehla gave the Panthers a two-goal cushion
by scoring 3:33 into the third.
	   Oleg Kvasha and Ray Whitney also scored for Florida, which is
just 3-3-1 at the new National Car Rental Center.
	   Adam Graves scored the lone goal for the Rangers.
 &UR; Red Wings 6, Blues 2 &QC; 
	   At Detroit, Steve Yzerman moved past Bryan Trottier, his boyhood
hero, for 10th place on the NHL career point list and Detroit
routed St. Louis.
	   Yzerman's goal and assist gave him 1,426 points, one more than
Trottier, whom Yzerman admired so much growing up that he took his
jersey number 19.
	   Yzerman tied Trottier with an assist on Vyacheslav Kozlov's
goal, the last of Detroit's four first-period goals. His goal in
the last minute of the second period gave the Red Wings a 6-0 lead.
	   Joe Kocur scored Detroit's first two goals and Kirk Maltby had
three first-period assists for the Red Wings, who have won two
straight after a four-game losing streak. Kris Draper had a goal
and an assist.
	   Scott Pellerin and Jim Campbell scored third-period goals for
the Blues.
 &UR; Mighty Ducks 5, Hurricanes 4, OT &QC; 
	   At Anaheim, California, Paul Kariya scored with 1:07 left in
regulation to tie the game, then Steve Rucchin deflected in the
winning goal 1:04 into overtime.
	   Anaheim trailed 3-1 heading into the third period, scored twice
to draw even, then fell behind again when Keith Primeau scored the
Hurricanes' fourth goal and his second of the night with 3:05
remaining in regulation. But Kariya answered two minutes later with
his seventh goal of the season.
	   Temu Selanne, Jim McKenzie and Marty McInnis had the other
Anaheim goals.
 &UR; Coyotes 2, Stars 0 &QC; 
	   At Dallas, Jimmy Waite turned aside 38 shots as the Coyotes
continued their best start in the 20-year history of the franchise,
handing Dallas its first home defeat of the season.
	   Keith Tkachuk and Jyrki Lumme scored for Phoenix, 7-2-2 overall
and 5-0-2 in its last seven games. The Coyotes haven't lost since
Oct. 22.
	   It was the first time Phoenix has won in Dallas since Feb. 12,
1997.

 &UR; Clinton has no plans for meeting Anwar wife, says U.S. official

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton does
not plan to meet with the wife of Malaysia's imprisoned former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, a U.S official said Thursday.
	   Azizah Ismail, wife of the imprisoned politician, reportedly has
expressed her wish to meet with Clinton when he attends a trade
summit in Kuala Lumpur next week.
	   ``We have no meetings scheduled or planned with Azizah Ismail,''
said the U.S. official, who is based in Kuala Lumpur. He spoke on
condition of not being further identified.
	   ``There's nothing in the schedule for it,'' the official added.
	   Azizah says she's confident she'll get to talk with the
presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines when they are in the
Malaysian capital for the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation forum.
	   Her husband is currently on trial for corruption and sex crimes,
in what he claims is a politically motivated vendetta.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ More U.N. relief workers were evacuated
Thursday from Iraq amid fears that a military strike by the United
States and Britain is imminent as Iraq showed no sign of backing
down from its refusal to deal with U.N. arms inspectors.
	   The evacuation, the second in two days, involved about 40 U.N.
humanitarian workers _ raising to 170 the number sent to the
Jordanian capital Amman since Wednesday. All 103 U.N. weapons
inspectors were taken out by air Wednesday to Bahrain in the Gulf.
	   In New York, U.N. officials said the departures would leave
about 40 U.N. staff members in Baghdad and more than 230 in the
north, where there are special relief operations for Iraqi Kurds.
	   The weather for Thursday's trip was sunny, compared with
Wednesday's driving rain.
	   Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride. There was
little evidence of Iraqis panicking or rushing to stock up on food.

Candidate in state election assassinated
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ Unidentified assassins shot to death a
candidate for the Delhi state assembly in the first apparent
political killing before a round of local elections later this
month.
	   Ved Singh, 30, who defected from the governing Bharatiya Janata
Party to run for the smaller Samata Party, was shot Wednesday night
300 meters (yards) from his home as he was ending a day of
campaigning. Two associates were badly wounded.
	   The election commission suspended the race for the seat in
Singh's constituency.
	   Voting for the Delhi assembly is one of four state elections to
be held Nov. 25, in the first test of the public mood since Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party took office
in March.
	   Police made no immediate statement about the motive for the
killing. Although political slayings are common during elections in
rural India, Singh was reported to be the first such victim in the
nation's capital.
	   The Statesman newspaper quoted Singh's father, Choudhary Bhim
Singh, as saying his son was threatened by people from the party he
had abandoned.
	   ``BJP leaders, including some party candidates, had threatened
him twice during the past few days. They were keen that my son
withdraw,'' he was quoted as saying.
	   But Indian newspapers reported the candidate also was a witness
in a murder case filed against two relatives of a prominent BJP
politician, and was linked to shady property developers.
	   The BJP and the Samata Party, led by Defense Minister George
Fernandes, are allies in the national politics, but competitors in
local politics.

Japan's opposition to free-trade pact worries APEC officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with APEC officials saying Japan remains
opposed to free-trade agreement, South Korean official saying
dispute between Japan and U.S. over the pact leaves other Asian
countries in a difficult position &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A South Korean official criticized
Japan on Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' when leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' the official said, on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit meeting on Tuesday
and Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, and fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among its developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   On Thursday, senior APEC officials began a two-day meeting to
hash out the agenda that Cabinet ministers will approve this
weekend for the summit meeting by the 21 leaders.
	   During Thursday's meeting, Japanese delegates reiterated their
opposition to cutting marine and forestry tariffs, APEC officials
from western countries said on condition of anonymity.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has accused Japan
of trying to derail the pact, saying it will fall apart unless the
world's second-largest economy approves all nine sectors.
	   The South Korean official at Thursday's APEC meeting said his
government supports the free-trade agreement, but could have
trouble selling it back home if Japan refuses to open its fishing
market.
	   South Korea, one of worst victims of the Asian economic crisis,
relies as heavily on fishing as Japan does, and its fishermen often
share the same waters.
	   The official said other countries in the region also could have
trouble selling the agreement to their people, given how much they
already are suffering under Asia's 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   After the APEC summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to
travel to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Just like last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis
that also has hurt Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   The United States has battled to keep the APEC response to the
crisis on the free-market road that the International Monetary Fund
has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, is expected to lead a counterassault, arguing that the IMF
prescription has failed to halt the crisis, instead leaving many
countries in deep recessions with little prospect of an early
recovery.
	   Mahathir would like endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets.
	   Those two views are likely to dominate the discussions during
the APEC summit, but are expected to be papered over before the
final statement is issued.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Reputed Hong Kong mob boss gets death in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments from Hong Kong bar; edits throughout &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong mob boss was sentenced to
death Thursday in China after being convicted of kidnapping and
arms smuggling in a case that highlighted legal system differences
between China and Hong Kong.
	   Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' learned his fate in a
Guangzhou courthouse ringed by sharpshooters and security personnel
wearing bullet-proof vests and carrying machine guns.
	   The case has riveted attention in Hong Kong, where two top
tycoons were reportedly kidnapped and paid hundreds of millions of
U.S. dollars in ransom to Cheung's gang.
	   Legal experts also raised questions about the jurisdiction,
noting that some crimes committed in Hong Kong, which does not
execute people, were prosecuted in China as capital offenses in a
trial closed to journalists.
	   The verdicts and sentences were explained by Chinese legal
officials in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160 kms) north of the Hong Kong
border, in a news conference carried by Hong Kong television
stations.
	   Cheung's underlings were found guilty in a string of spectacular
crimes, including the smuggling of dynamite and guns from China
into Hong Kong, seven armed robberies at Hong Kong gold stores that
netted 7.4 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 950,000) and the
theft of 277 tons of steel in Shenzhen, China, according to the
official Chinese news agency Xinhua.
	   One man, identified only by the surname Li, was killed in the
steel heist, Xinhua said.
	   Four of Cheung's accomplices, Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang
Hui and Chin Hon-sau, also were sentenced to death by the
Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou, Xinhua said.
	   Two others, Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan, received death sentences
that the court suspended for two years, giving them time to
demonstrate good behavior and perhaps have their punishments
reduced to prison terms, Xinhua said.
	   Twenty-nine other members of Cheung's gang were sentenced to
prison, some for life, Xinhua said, citing a public announcement
from the court.
	   Hong Kong media had reported the case also concerned murders of
a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident. Xinhua
made no mention of murder charges, although it mentioned at least
one death, during the steel theft.
	   Under Chinese law, the gangsters can appeal within 10 days of
receiving a written judgment. Those who got death will have their
cases automatically reviewed by the Higher People's Court of
Guangdong Province, Xinhua said.
	   Cheung's case was the first high-profile cross-border trial
since the territory reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last
year.
	   Despite calls from Cheung's lawyers to have the case transferred
to Hong Kong, which has a more open court system modeled after
Britain's, authorities here said they could not take over. The
kidnappings and other crimes were never reported to Hong Kong
police, so Hong Kong prosecutors had no evidence.
	   The Hong Kong Bar Association said Thursday the Chinese courts
had every right to try the gangsters.
	   But Hong Kong's failure to seek the return of any defendants
``may give people the false impression that the judiciary and the
rule of law in Hong Kong is somehow subordinate to that of the rest
of China, and thus indirectly cast a question mark over the concept
`One country, two systems,''' attorney Ronny Tong said on behalf of
the bar.

Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army was slated to open gas mask
distribution centers Thursday in preparation for a possible attack
by Iraq if the United States uses force in the latest Gulf crisis,
an army spokesman said.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was slated to meet
with top ministers Thursday to discuss the tensions and Israeli
preparedness in case of an Iraqi strike, Israel radio reported.
	   Some 25 percent of Israelis do not have gas masks or have
outdated ones, the radio said.
	   ``At noon time (1000 GMT), the civil defense is slated to open
some 65 centers for gas mask distribution,'' said army spokesman
Oded Ben-Ami. The number will gradually be increased to 150 centers
that will be open 24 hours a day, the radio said.
	   But army officials urged Israelis not to change their daily
routines. Gen. David Ivri, an advisor to Israeli Defense Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai, said the chances of an Iraqi attack on Israel
were slim.
	   The U.S. State Department issued an advisory Wednesday
suggesting employees in non-essential positions in Kuwait and
Israel leave the region.
	   The United States has threatened to use force against Iraq if it
does not back down on its decision late last month to stop
cooperating with U.N. arms inspectors who left the Arab country
this week.
	   Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles on Israel in the 1991 Gulf War.

Show of solidarity may not be enough to rebuild Central America

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Celebrities are arriving and
governments are promising millions of dollars, but it's far from
clear whether the show of solidarity will be enough to rebuild
Central America after Hurricane Mitch.
	   The storm that killed 10,000 people has set back the region's
development by years, and many Central Americans say they have seen
little sign of the promised foreign aid.
	   On Wednesday, Tipper Gore wrapped up a visit to the region with
a promise to repeat victims' stories of suffering so the world
would send more help.
	   The wife of U.S. Vice President Al Gore flew home to Washington
after spending two days in the ravaged Honduran capital of
Tegucigalpa and in Managua, where she joined an assembly line
filling aid packages and distributing supplies to homeless
refugees.
	   ``The eyes of the children are filled with hope,'' Mrs. Gore
said at Managua's Ciudad Sandino camp, where thousands flocked
after Mitch swept their homes into an overflowing river. ``All we
can do is tell the world of the devastation here so they can
help.''
	   Mrs. Gore was part of a first wave of foreign visitors arriving
to survey the devastation caused by Mitch, which began Oct. 22 and
hit the region with hurricane winds three days later, causing
massive floods and mudslides across Honduras, Nicaragua, El
Salvador and Guatemala.
	   Other visitors include Colombian First Lady Nohra Pastrana, who
arrived in Managua as Mrs. Gore's plane was taking off. Hillary
Rodham Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac are planning to
visit to the region next week.
	   Bianca Jagger, the ex-wife of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger,
returned to her native Nicaragua on Wednesday with 60,000 pounds
(27,215 kilos) of medicine and food for storm victims.
	   Spain's Prince Felipe plans to visit Honduras later this week to
bring aid and survey damage.
	   Nicaraguan President Arnoldo Aleman told Mrs. Gore on Wednesday
that he was ``heartened by the solidarity and brotherhood of the
international community'' but said his country still needs much
more help.
	   Mrs. Gore planned to brief President Bill Clinton on Thursday on
the relief efforts in Central America.
	   Governments and aid organizations from around the world have
promised hundreds of millions of dollars in relief.
	   Spain and Austria on Wednesday joined France and Cuba in
offering to forgive millions of dollars of Central America's
foreign debt.
	   Before leaving Managua, Mrs. Gore announced the United States
would add dlrs 1.5 million in medical aid and send 12 more
helicopters to help those already flying relief supplies to
isolated areas.
	   Yet with so much of Central America in ruins, the aid announced
so far is likely to fall well short of the need. In Honduras alone,
the Inter-American Development Bank has estimated that up to 90
percent of the country's roads and other infrastructure were
destroyed.
	   After meeting with Aleman, Mrs. Gore helped volunteers shovel
beans, rice and milk packages into plastic bags for distribution to
disaster victims.
	   Mrs. Gore was joined on her trip by Brian Atwood, who heads the
U.S. Agency for International Development, Nicaraguan pitcher
Dennis Martinez of the Atlanta Braves and John Leonard, deputy
assistant secretary of state for Latin America.
	   Martinez was greeted with warm cheers as he and Mrs. Gore handed
out toilet paper and water bottles at the Ciudad Sandino refugee
camp. He urged his countrymen to begin rebuilding on their own and
not to wait for foreign help.
	   Elizabeth Dole, head of the American Red Cross, also was in
Central America this week to survey damage and help in the relief
effort. She left Managua on Wednesday to return to the United
States.

Hong Kong officials arrest three in pirate VCD raid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Customs officials said Thursday they had raided
an unlicensed video compact disc operation, seizing suspected
pirate discs and equipment worth 29 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S.
dlrs 3.7 million) and arresting three suspects.
	   The raid on Wednesday smashed a plant believed to have been
making pirated VCDs, according to authorities who had claimed in
September they had stopped all such production of the bogus
products in Hong Kong.
	   Under international pressure, mainly from U.S. officials and
Japanese television programmers, Hong Kong authorities have been
cracking down on pirate VCD manufacturers and dealers.
	   Another recent raid intercepted goods smuggled from the nearby
Portuguese enclave of Macau, where much of the illicit
manufacturing industry set up following a series of raids in Hong
Kong.
	   Despite the increased pressure from law enforcers, pirated
compact discs, video compact discs and computer software are
readily available in stores across Hong Kong.
	   Copies of local or Hollywood movies are sold for less than 40
Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 5) _ sometimes before they have even
been released in local movie houses.
	   Last year, customs officials seized 66 million Hong Kong dollars
(U.S. dlrs 8.46 million) worth of counterfeit products and arrested
850 suspects.

Candidate in state election assassinated

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ The assassination of a candidate for the
Delhi state assembly _ apparently the first political killing
before local elections later this month _ has strained relations in
the ruling coalition.
	   Ved Singh, 30, who defected from the governing Bharatiya Janata
Party to run for the smaller Samata Party, was shot Tuesday night
300 meters (yards) from his home as he was ending a day of
campaigning. Two associates were badly wounded.
	   The election commission suspended the race for the seat in
Singh's constituency.
	   Voting for the Delhi assembly is one of four state elections to
be held Nov. 25, in the first test of the public mood since Prime
Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's Bharatiya Janata Party took office
in March.
	   Defense Minister George Fernandes, leader of the Samata Party,
was quoted as calling the slaying a political murder, and said he
would discuss it with Vajpayee. His party demanded an investigation
of BJP politicians allegedly linked to the case.
	   The BJP and the Samata Party are allies in the national
politics, but competitors in local politics. The Samata Party is
one of the 19 parties in the ruling coalition, controlling 12 of
the partnership's 276 seats.
	   Police made no immediate statement about the motive for Singh's
killing. Although political slayings are common during elections in
rural India, Singh was described as the first such victim in the
nation's capital.
	   ``BJP leaders, including some party candidates, had threatened
him twice during the past few days. They were keen that my son
withdraw,'' The Statesman newspaper quoted Singh's father,
Choudhary Bhim Singh, as saying.
	   Indian newspapers also reported the candidate was a witness in a
murder case filed against two relatives of a prominent BJP
politician, and was himself linked to shady property developers.

Japan's ruling party unveils new economic stimulus package

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the broadest effort yet to jumpstart the world's
second-largest economy, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
ruling party outlined plans Thursday for the country's biggest
stimulus package ever.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party proposals will form the basis of an
official government plan to be formally announced on Monday and
expected to be passed later this month in a special session of
Parliament.
	   The centerpiece of the party's package calls for 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 81 billion) in public works-related spending through next
March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts next
year.
	   With the addition of corporate tax cuts and other tax relief
measures, it was expected to total a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs
147 billion).
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi Sakaiya,
said Thursday that the government plan will likely include a mix of
tax cuts worth about 7 trillion yen (dlrs 57 billion).
	   The widely expected package was compiled in a bid to prevent
Japan's economy from shrinking for a third consecutive year and to
fulfill Obuchi's pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   It also comes just days before Obuchi meets President Clinton
and other leaders this weekend at an annual gathering of the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.
	   The government has faced intense pressure both from opposition
parties at home and foreign trade partners such as the United
States to deal with record unemployment, soaring bankruptcies and
deeply shaken consumer confidence.
	   One million new jobs were expected to be created once the new
economic package has been implemented, the governing party said.
	   But investors signaled disappointment with the plan. Japan's
benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index fell 352.96 points, or 2.45
percent, to 14,075.06.
	   Many private economists were also skeptical the stimulus
measures would put Japan back on track for solid recovery.
	   ``It's just enough to prevent further deterioration,'' said
Cameron Uematsu, senior economist in the Tokyo office of Warburg
Dillon Read. He added that it was ``clearly not sufficient'' to
pull the economy out of the doldrums.
	   Japan officially estimates gross domestic product will contract
by 1.8 percent for the current fiscal year, which ends March 31,
1999. The economy shrank 0.7 percent last year.
	   On Tuesday, President Clinton singled out Japan _ as he often
has in recent months _ as the key to reviving economic growth in
Asia and pulling the region out of the financial crisis that is
beginning to be felt on American soil.
	   ``The restoration of growth in Japan, which has been stalled now
for more than five years, is absolutely essential to the
restoration of growth in the rest of Asia,'' Clinton said. ``The
rest of us look to Japan to move quickly.''
	   The proposals announced Thursday for a supplementary budget, the
third such appropriation measure so far this year, also include
reducing the effective Japanese corporate tax rate to 40 percent in
the fiscal year starting next April, down from the current rate of
about 46 percent.
	   The ruling party called for other measures as well, including
consideration of tax incentives to stimulate housing demand and
private investment.
	   It also recommends a novel idea designed to get consumers to
spend more _ the distribution of government-issue shopping coupons
worth about 20,000 yen (dlrs 163) to the elderly and families with
young children.

Anwar's wife urges ASEAN to support human rights
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia-Anwar Trial

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ The wife of Malaysia's sacked deputy
prime minister Anwar Ibrahim has urged the country's Southeast
Asian neighbors to worry less about non-interference in each
other's affairs and do more to promote regional human rights.
	   Wan Azizah Wan Ismail was quoted by The Nation newspaper in
Bangkok in an interview published Thursday as saying that she
wanted to see ``a more vocal engagement'' by the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations over her husband's plight.
	   Anwar is being tried on charges of sodomy and abuse of power in
a case that has riveted international attention. He was sacked by
his one-time mentor, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, in September
following disputes over Malaysia's response to the regional
economic crisis.
	   Anwar has accused his former boss of corruption and cronyism and
his trial _ believed by critics to be thinly disguised political
revenge _ has coalesced opposition to Mahathir's 18-year rule.
	   Wan Azizah has spearheaded a campaign to internationalize her
husband's trial and tried to drive a wedge between the nine
countries of ASEAN _ whose criticism would be taken the most
seriously by Malaysia _ over the group's long-standing policy of
non-interference.
	   ``You speak about justice, universal values and human rights _
that's not interference to me. Because those values are
borderless,'' Wan Azizah was quoted as saying.
	   ``We live in a global society, especially ASEAN. We are
neighbors,'' she went on. ``So whatever affects the region should
be collectively seen. That's how I would like to see ASEAN move as
we talk about regional prosperity, regional stability and regional
peace and harmony.''
	   During a visit by Wan Azizah last month to Manila, Philippines
President Joseph Estrada broke with ASEAN tradition and criticized
the trial of Anwar. So has Indonesia's President B.J. Habibie.
Thailand's Foreign Ministry has expressed concern over how it could
affect ASEAN.
	   ASEAN comprises Brunei, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.
	   Wan Azizah told The Nation that she had been contacted by
officials from several countries whose leaders will arrive in Kuala
Lumpur next week for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit
regarding possible meetings with her.
	   She refused to disclose the names or countries but said she will
be meeting Habibie's wife and said that she believes Estrada has
expressed his desire to meet Anwar, The Nation said.

Dollar climbs against yen, Japanese stocks finish sharply lower
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with closing Nikkei, mid-afternoon dollar and bond &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar climbed against the yen Thursday on
a U.S. news report that the United States was planning to attack
Iraq. Japanese stock prices closed sharply lower.
	   The dollar bought 122.86 yen at mid-afternoon, up 1.74 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level of
121.72 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 352.96 points,
or 2.45 percent, closing at 14,075.06 points. On Wednesday, the
index gained 319.93 points, or 2.27 percent.
	   Traders rushed to buy dollars following a CBS News report
quoting White House sources as saying that while a military attack
was not likely in the next 12 hours, an aerial assault could come
as early as Thursday.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
strike since Iraq said late last month it was stopping the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning
a major buildup of warplanes and troops, President Bill Clinton
said that not enforcing U.N. demands for arms inspections would be
a costly mistake.
	   The dollar, regarded as a safe haven, often strengthens at times
of international tension.
	   The yen came under renewed selling pressure after investors were
disappointed in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's outline for a
new economic stimulus package for Japan, market players said.
	   On the stock market, selling accelerated in the afternoon as
many investors found little new in the LDP measures. Almost all
elements of the package had already been leaked to local media in
recent days.
	   ``There is a feeling of slight disappointment,'' said Masaaki
Higashida, deputy general manager of investment information and
services at Nomura Securities.
	   The opposition Liberal Party is pushing for a cut in the 5
percent consumption tax, but it could meet opposition from the
ruling LDP. The two parties are currently discussing forming an
alliance.
	   The centerpiece of the LDP package calls for 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 82 billion) in public works-related spending through next
March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts next
year.
	   With the addition of corporate tax cuts and other tax relief
measures, it will likely total a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 148
billion).
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 15.19 points, or 1.38 percent, to 1,082.93.
The TOPIX rose 19.8 points, or 1.84 percent, the previous day.
	   Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost
40.16 points to finish Wednesday's session at 8,823.82.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.820 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.855
percent, driving its price up 108.71 yen from 108.37 yen.

Indonesia to sign deal for another dlrs 1 billion in aid
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - Indonesia has reached agreement with
the International Monetary Fund on a new letter of intent which
should pave the way for another dlrs 1 billion in aid, the
government said Thursday.
	   Ginandjar Kartasasmita, the senior economics minister, said the
letter would be the IMF's last monthly review of its assistance
program for economically struggling Indonesia.
	   The fund began conducting monthly reviews after the country's
major upheaval in May, which culminated in the ouster of former
President Suharto and his replacement by B.J Habibie. The IMF
usually carries out quarterly reviews of its assistance programs.
	   Ginandjar said that for the next six months, the IMF will
conduct program reviews every two months, and will move to
quarterly reviews after that.
	   Finding an effective way to monitor its Indonesia program has
been a key concern of the IMF, even before the riots and protests
against Suharto in May. The fund was repeatedly frustrated by
Suharto's breaching of program commitments while he was in office.
	   Ginandjar said the government would announce the formal details
of its new IMF agreement on Friday.
	   The IMF's director for the Asia-Pacific region, Hubert Neiss, is
in Jakarta this week to wind up the program review.
	   Ginandjar said the week's discussions with the IMF focused on
bank restructuring, easing monetary policy, controlling inflation
and boosting the value of the rupiah.
	   Overall, the IMF has pledged to assist Indonesia with about dlrs
11.3 billion to help it overcome its financial crisis, as long as
Indonesia makes progress on economic reforms. The World Bank and
other donors have pledged billions more.

Israel issues bids for construction of Jewish neighborhood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an attempt to blunt strident opposition to
the land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians, the government
on Thursday published bids for the construction of a large Jewish
neighborhood in disputed east Jerusalem.
	   In a first phase, 1,025 homes will be built in the Har Homa
neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, the sector
claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital. In all, some 6,500
homes are to be built in the area known in Arabic as Jabal Abu
Ghneim.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's adviser, Ahmed Tibi, called
the planned construction ``a dangerous step'' that violated the Wye
peace accord ratified by Israel's Cabinet on Wednesday.
	   In March 1997, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government decided to break ground for Har Homa, the Palestinians
suspended all contacts with Israel, and for the next 18 months
peace talks were deadlocked.
	   Infrastructure work at the site was completed nearly a year ago
and technically, the bids could gave been issued at that time.
Still, Netanyahu held up construction for months, apparently
fearing that building activity could lead to new disruptions of the
peace process.
	   In presenting the new peace agreement to the Cabinet on
Wednesday, Netanyahu faced stiff opposition from his ministers,
with only eight out of 17 voting in favor of the accord.
	   The decision to begin building at Har Homa was widely seen as an
attempt by Netanyahu to silence his hard-line critics. Netanyahu
was evasive when asked about the construction Wednesday. ``I said
that by 2000 we will build and time is getting short,'' he sad.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later
annexed the area. The Palestinians hope to establish a future
capital in east Jerusalem, which is home to 180,000 Palestinians.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton does
not plan to meet with the wife of Malaysia's imprisoned former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, a U.S official said Thursday.
	   Azizah Ismail, wife of the imprisoned politician, reportedly has
expressed her wish to meet with Clinton when he attends a trade
summit in Kuala Lumpur next week.
	   ``We have no meetings scheduled or planned with Azizah Ismail,''
said the U.S. official, who is based in Kuala Lumpur. He spoke on
condition of not being further identified.
	   ``There's nothing in the schedule for it,'' the official added.
	   Azizah says she's confident she'll get to talk with the
presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines when they are in the
Malaysian capital for the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group.
	   Her husband is currently on trial for alleged corruption and sex
crimes, in what he claims is a politically motivated vendetta.
Anwar was arrested Sept. 20 after leading an anti-government rally
of 30,000 people in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Since his arrest, Azizah has become the de-facto leader of
Anwar's stalled campaign for political reform, holding press
conferences and delivering statements on his behalf.
	   When Anwar's trial broke for lunch Thursday, Azizah read a
statement signed by her husband from the courthouse lock-up. It
accused Mahathir of nepotism and cronyism and demanded he release a
full list of government-awarded contracts.
	   ``I wish to urge again for transparency in government
administration,'' Anwar said in the statement.
	   Anwar said that although Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had
disclosed a list of state privatization projects several months ago
it left out ``the big ones, especially those worth billions of
ringgit (tens of millions of dollars) involving the interests of
his family and cronies.''

Israel issues bids for construction of Jewish neighborhood
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LAURIE COPANS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In an attempt to blunt strident opposition to
the land-for-peace agreement with the Palestinians, the Israeli
government published bids Thursday for the construction of a large
Jewish neighborhood in disputed east Jerusalem.
	   In a first phase, 1,025 homes will be built in the Har Homa
neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem, the sector
claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital. In all, some 6,500
homes are to be built in the area known in Arabic as Jabal Abu
Ghneim.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's adviser, Ahmed Tibi, called
the planned construction ``a dangerous step'' that violated the Wye
peace accord ratified Wednesday by Israel's Cabinet.
	   In March 1997, when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's
government decided to break ground for Har Homa, the Palestinians
suspended all contacts with Israel, and for the next 18 months
peace talks were deadlocked.
	   Infrastructure work at the site was completed nearly a year ago
and technically, the bids could have been issued at that time.
Still, Netanyahu held up construction for months, apparently
fearing that building activity could lead to new disruptions.
	   In presenting the new peace agreement Wednesday to the Cabinet,
Netanyahu faced stiff opposition from his ministers, with only
eight out of 17 voting in favor.
	   The decision to begin building at Har Homa was widely seen as an
attempt by Netanyahu to silence his hard-line critics. Netanyahu
was evasive when asked about the construction Wednesday. ``I said
that by 2000 we will build and time is getting short,'' he sad.
	   Israel captured east Jerusalem in the 1967 Mideast War and later
annexed the area. East Jerusalem is home to 180,000 Palestinians.

Games abandoned as Pakistan A players hurt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TIMARU, New Zealand (AP) _ Two Pakistan A batsmen suffered
broken bones leading to the abandonment of its tour match Friday
because of a dangerous wicket.
	   Opener Wajahatullaha Wasti suffered fractured ribs and middle
order batsman Taimur Khan had a broken thumb when batting against
Northern Conference. The incidents came in the middle session of
the second day after the home side batted without trouble during
the morning.
	   Umpires Doug Cowie and Chris King called the match off after the
batsmen were hurt.
	   ``This pitch never looked good,'' King said. ``Some pitches
don't look good and play all right but unfortunately this one
didn't.''
	   Cowie said there were suggestions that the teams continue with
spinners but, ``we couldn't play golden oldies rules at this
level.''
	   At the abandonment Pakistan A was 141 for six chasing the solid
Northern total of 272.

Religious police sweep through country imposing rules
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATHY GANNON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Afghanistan's religious police swept
through the country publicly beating men for shaving, smashing
bottles of liquor and setting fire to video cassette recorders, the
Taliban-run radio said Thursday.
	   In northern Pul-e-Kumri, recently captured by the Taliban
religious army, 200 bottles of wine were smashed in the town
center, Radio Shariat reported.
	   In the 90 percent of Afghanistan under Taliban rule, a strict
brand of Islamic law has been imposed. Most forms of light
entertainment like music and videos have been banned. Alcohol is
strictly prohibited. Men must wear a beard, and women are hidden by
the all-enveloping burqua that covers them from head to toe.
	   Religious police roam the streets of towns and cities enforcing
the Taliban's laws and punishing offenders.
	   Pul-e-Kumri, barely 150 kilometers (90 miles) north of the
beleaguered capital of Kabul, was previously ruled by Ismaili
Muslim leader Sayed Jaffer, a moderate Muslim from southern
California.
	   Jaffer returned to his native Afghanistan in the early 1980s to
lead a small, but well-armed band of Ismaili Muslims, against
invading Soviet soldiers.
	   When the Taliban religious army of Islamic students gained
control over most of the country, Jaffer joined the anti-Taliban
alliance. His soldiers fought along side those of former military
chief Ahmed Shah Massood.
	   After heavy fighting earlier this year, Jaffer was driven from
Pul-e-Kumri, where he had lived in relative comfort. His luxurious
home was well equipped with alcohol, which he offered to foreign
journalists who visited his compound.
	   The Radio Shariat broadcast also said the Taliban's religious
police set fire to 12 video cassette recorders hidden away in
Jaffer's former domain.
	   In Afghanistan's eastern Logar province, barely 60 kilometers
(36 miles) from the capital of Kabul, revelers at a wedding were
arrested because they were playing music.
	   In southern Helmand province, 28 men were punished for a variety
of crimes ranging from shaving to gambling, the Radio Shariat
broadcast said.

Kasprowicz aiming for English scalps
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ Australian paceman Michael Kasprowicz
will be hunting for his lost test place when he confronts the
English tourists Friday in their final warm-up match before the
Ashes series begins.
	   The Queenslander took 5-28 in his previous test and earned
plenty of praise for his efforts in the series against India on the
subcontinent. But he lost his spot when Australia was in Pakistan
last month as the selectors opted for the versatility of Colin
Miller and veteran swing bowler Damien Fleming.
	   Kasprowicz is a chance to make the Nov. 20 first test on his
home ground at the Gabba but will need to bowl well against England
in the four-day match starting Friday.
	   ``It can play on your confidence if you're not getting picked,''
Kasprowicz said Thursday. ``All of a sudden you start to ask
yourself 'maybe I'm not bowling well' and things like that. In
those circumstances it does pull you down a little bit but you have
got to stay strong.''
	   Kasprowicz said he was wary of trying too hard to impress the
selectors in Friday's match.
	   ``I've been in the position before when you come into a game and
you really have to impress people and look for results,''
Kasprowicz said. ``I've done it before and tried too hard. My plan
is to get out there and have fun, find good rhythm and just enjoy
it.''
	   England's team, which has drawn its other two test warm-up
matches, had a day off Thursday. They went snorkeling off the coast
of tropical north Queensland.

Honduras mourns charismatic mayor killed surveying Mitch damage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Mitch &QL; 
 &UR; By PETER MUELLO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Of the thousands of deaths in the
wake of Hurricane Mitch, none was so widely lamented as that of
Tegucigalpa's charismatic mayor, killed in a helicopter crash while
surveying storm damage last week.
	   Thousands turned out in the rain Wednesday to attend a memorial
Mass for Cesar Castellanos Madrid, a man Hondurans affectionately
called El Gordito, or Little Fat One. Many believed he would have
been their next president.
	   ``All of Honduras, everyone was for El Gordito,'' said Ruis
Guevara, a nurse's aide.
	   Holding candles and his picture, they packed a white-stucco
cathedral and spilled out on the adjacent plaza.
	   Loudspeakers allowed crowds outside the church to hear the
eulogies. Inside, church workers handed out scrolls, tied with
black ribbon, praising his life's work. ``Today, with your death,
you force us to have a new reason to live,'' they read.
	   ``He was a great man for Honduras. He cleaned up the trash,''
said Lourdes de Ortega, a merchant.
	   ``See that?'' She pointed to a covered bus stop. ``El Gordito
built that.''
	   She waved at a store front. ``El Gordito painted that. He
painted houses. He painted everything.''
	   Castellanos' helicopter crashed Nov. 1 as it took off on a
mission to survey hurricane damage, killing the mayor and three
other people.
	   His city was pummeled by fierce winds and heavy rain that
devastated the nation's infrastructure. In all, 6,000 of the 10,000
deaths blamed on Hurricane Mitch came in Honduras.
	   In a country not known for efficient and honest civil servants,
Castellanos seemed like an exception, and many admired his crusade
to rebuild the run-down capital.
	   As minister of health, he visited the most remote places, his
wide frame perched on a bicycle, scooter or on horseback. He also
set up a program to distribute free milk to children.
	   El Gordito may have left a political heir. People already are
talking about electing his widow, Vilma, as the city's next mayor.
Castellanos also is survived by his five children.
	   ``We all knew he would be the next president,'' said Orilio
Padilla Coello, a hotel manager. ``They say the good die young, and
he was just good, good, good.''

China scorns Dalai Lama's U.S. visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ A leading Chinese newspaper on Thursday derided
the Dalai Lama's efforts during a visit to Washington this week to
restart talks with Beijing on Tibetan autonomy.
	   Reflecting China's anger over the exiled Tibetan spiritual
leader's meetings with U.S. President Bill Clinton and other senior
officials, the state-run China Daily scorned the Dalai Lama's visit
as ``nothing but a public relations farce.''
	   Comments by Chinese officials and the state-run media indicate
that the Dalai Lama's latest effort to move toward talks with China
on Tibetan autonomy have failed to appease Beijing.
	   The China Daily commentary accused the Dalai Lama, who fled to
India in 1959 during a failed uprising against China, of unfairly
criticizing China's often harsh rule over the Himalayan region and
of trying to use foreign influence to pressure Beijing.
	   ``If the Dalai Lama does have the sincerity to talk, he does not
need to internationalize the issue,'' the editorial said.
	   It reiterated China's doubts over the Dalai Lama's
acknowledgement that Tibet is part of China and his disavowal of
hopes for an independent Tibet.
	   It also scorned the Nobel Peace Prize laureate's personal
motivations, accusing the Dalai Lama of unfairly portraying himself
and his people as victims of the Chinese government.
	   ``Posing himself as an innocent religious leader deprived of a
homeland by a powerful government, he wishfully expects to be
rewarded with generous sympathy and support,'' it said.
	   ``The Dalai Lama show, staged again in the United States with
the usual ploy of `drop-by' meetings with White House politicians,
is nothing but a public relations farce,'' the commentary said.

	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ The three-month civil war in the Congo
appears headed for a showdown _ on the battlefield, not at the
negotiating table.
	   Last week, Rwanda publicly admitted being involved in the
conflict on the side of the rebels. African negotiatiors had hoped
the admission would appease Congolese President Laurent Kabila and
pave the way for a settlement.
	   Instead, peace looks more remote than ever.
	   The problem is as simple as it was when the rebellion broke out
Aug. 2 _ Kabila is refusing to negotiate with the rebels because
they want nothing less than his departure. He is fighting to hold
on to power, relying mainly on increasingly cash-poor Zimbabwe.
	   Kabila appears to be paying for Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe's assistance in troops and jet fighters with gold and mining
concessions, a practice his predecessor Mobutu Sese Seko used to
remain in power for 32 years.
	   Last week, Kabila named Zimbabwean businessman Billy Rautenbach
to get the state-owned Gecamines copper and cobalt mining concern
back on its feet. In addition, Zimbabwe has signed lucrative
defense and mining contracts with Congo.
	   But despite Mugabe's determination to defeat the rebellion,
after saving Kinshasa from rebel capture in August, his forces have
done nothing to halt the anti-Kabila military offensive that is
making steady gains in both northern Congo and in the southern,
mineral-rich provinces of Eastern Kasai and Katanga, Kabila's home.
	   Rwanda says its forces will stay in Congo as long as necessary,
or as long as Kabila is in power. Uganda appears ready to do the
same.
	   Both countries originally helped pull Kabila, a former Marxist,
out of political obscurity. They backed him in his war to overthrow
Mobutu, the dictator who fell from power in May 1997.
	   But their troops are in Congo now because Kabila failed to rid
their common border area of Rwandan and Ugandan rebels intent on
destabilizing their governments.
	   Instead, Rwandan leaders say, Kabila has enlisted _ to fight the
Rwandan-backed rebels _ at least 7,000 former Hutu soldiers and
militiamen responsible for the 1994 genocide in Rwanda and for
sponsoring a string of anti-Tutsi massacres in eastern, central and
northern Congo since August.
	   Rwanda says Kabila's troops and his allies would have wiped out
Congo's Tutsi minority had it not stepped in.
	   ``If the rebels didn't make territorial gains in Congo, there
would be a genocide taking place there. We are stopping the
genocide in Congo, and the international community is frankly glad
that somebody is doing it, because they wouldn't do it
themselves,'' said Patrick Mazimhaka, a minister in Rwandan
President Pasteur Bizimungu's office.
	   It is not clear how long Kabila's allies will stick with him.
	   Zimbabwe reportedly is spending up to dlrs 1 million a day to
keep its troops in Congo _ even though the public disapproves of
being involved in a foreign conflict that is causing inflation and
civil unrest.
	   Angola says it has security interests to defend in southwestern
Congo where the UNITA rebels have established a rear base to keep
up their fight against Angolan government forces.
	   After Angolan troops helped to defend Kinshasa against rebel
advances in August, Angola's commitment to push east to meet the
rebels is not clear.
	   Rwanda says Mugabe and Kabila are shutting the doors to
negotiations, and unless they change their mind, there will be a
military solution to the conflict _ and not in their favor.

U.N. stages second evacuation of relief workers from Iraq

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A second batch of about 40 U.N. relief
workers left Iraq by bus on Thursday amid fears that military
strikes by the United States and Britain were imminent.
	   The evacuation raised to 170 the number of humanitarian program
staffers who have been evacuated to the Jordanian capital Amman
since Wednesday. Besides, all 103 United Nations weapons inspectors
went to Bahrain by air on Wednesday.
	   The U.N. said 270 humanitarian workers are left in Iraq, mostly
in the Kurdish north that is unlikely to be targeted by the
strikes.
	   Despite mounting military threats, Iraq showed no sign of
backing down from its refusal to allow the resumption of arms
inspections _ the heart of the crisis.
	   In a front page editorial, the ruling Baath party newspaper,
al-Thawra, said the U.S. military preparations in the Gulf were
part of American ``psychological warfare.''
	   ``Iraq no longer pays attention to these empty threats,'' it
said and asserted that Iraq will not back down.
	   The official al-Qadissiya newspaper said President Saddam
Hussein's Cabinet discussed the crisis Wednesday.
	   Iraq's five official dailies published pictures of Saddam
meeting ministers and senior military commanders to discuss a
response to the ``American and Zionist aggression.''
	   The papers also published a statement by the Baath party urging
Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at American interests
in case of U.S. aggression.
	   Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride, and there
was little evidence of panic or people rushing to stock up on food.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
response since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning
a major buildup of warplanes and troops, President Bill Clinton
warned that spurning U.N. demands for arms inspections would be a
costly mistake for Iraq.
	   The U.N. Security Council has backed Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's call to Saddam for immediately resuming cooperation with
the weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq says it will not do so unless the council moves to begin
lifting trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   But the council is bound by a resolution that will not allow the
lifting of sanctions until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
dismantled its nuclear program, weapons of biological and chemical
nature and long range missiles.
	   The sanctions have contributed to Iraq's economic devastation.
Recognizing the plight of the Iraqis, the United Nations has
allowed Iraq to sell limited quantities of crude oil to buy food
and medicine for its 22 million people since December 1996.
	   The humanitarian operations were monitored by 450 people in Iraq
before Wednesday's departures.
	   The United Nations said in New York that Thursday's evacuation
would leave about 40 U.N. staff members in Baghdad and more than
230 in the north, where it has carries out relief operations on
behalf of the Iraqi government for the Kurdish communities.
	   Staffers who stayed behind quickly hung mesh screens over the
glass windows of the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad
_ likely a precaution against flying glass in the event of a
military strike.
	   Among the U.N. people staying back in the country are Shah, the
U.N. envoy, and Hans von Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian
operations who took up his post in Iraq on Monday.
	   Von Sponeck said the evacuation would slow down but not end the
distribution of relief supplies in government-controlled areas.
	   ``Our capacity is much reduced,'' von Sponeck said. ``But
whatever capacity we have we will utilize for our humanitarian
program.''
	   The pullout is likely to halt the work of other specialized
agencies such as the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Health Organization.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz had sent a letter to Annan complaining about
the withdrawal of the weapons inspectors, saying that UNSCOM was
following U.S. orders and using the United Nations as ``false
cover.''
	   At a meeting of eight Arab foreign ministers Wednesday in Qatar,
three Gulf countries _ Kuwait, Bahrain and Qatar _ called for a
diplomatic solution to the crisis. Qatar urged Iraq to cooperate
with the U.N.

Irish folk singer Paddy Clancy dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) _ Paddy Clancy, who sang with the Clancy
Brothers and Tommy Makem, the influential Irish folk group of the
1950s and 1960s, has died at age 76.
	   Paddy Clancy died Wednesday after a long illness at his home in
the County Waterford town of Carrick-on-Suir in southeast Ireland,
according to death notices in Irish newspapers.
	   A funeral mass at St. Nicholas Church in Carrick-on-Suir is
scheduled for noon on Friday.
	   It was in New York in 1959 at the beginning of the folk music
boom that the Clancy brothers and their friend Tommy Makem formed
their group.
	   They performed in Greenwich Village clubs and appeared at
Newport folk festivals with such people as Judy Collins and Pete
Seeger.
	   Brother Bobby Clancy also occasionally sang with the group,
which was considered a major influence on the current folk music
revival in Ireland. They made more than 50 records.
	   After touring for about nine years as The Clancy Brothers and
Tommy Makem, he struck out on his own, and has been on his own
since. But they remained friends, and they got together again in
1993 for the Madison Square Garden concert honoring Bob Dylan's 30
years in music.
	   Tommy Clancy died in 1990, but Liam, Paddy and Bobby and their
nephew Robbie O'Connell continued to sing into the 1990s.
	   Information about survivors was not immediately available.

Anwar taunts foes, tales of sexual escapades fill trial

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday taunted
his foes in the Malaysian government, while his criminal trial was
brimming with tales of the former deputy prime minister's alleged
sexual escapades.
	   At one point, a police witness described how Anwar's former
driver clutched the Koran, the sacred book of Islam, as he swore
that Anwar had sodomized him.
	   The 51-year-old Anwar says he is the victim of a politically
motivated vendetta in this predominantly Muslim nation, which
usually avoids public discussion of politicians' sex lives.
	   Many Malaysians are shocked by the stories they have been
hearing from Anwar's trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges.
	   During a break in Thursday's proceedings, Anwar issued a string
of verbal taunts against the government and his one-time patron,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, despite a gag order.
	   ``There are two sets of laws, one for me and one for Dr.
Mahathir. They put me in prison and they asked me to shut up. I'm
in prison, so why are they scared?'' Anwar told a group of
reporters in the courthouse hallway.
	   He added: ``There are so many poison pen letters against the
prime minister and (the national police chief). I've seen so many
of them.''
	   Anwar's trial is already expected to drag on well into next
year, but the defendant said that if Mahathir is still in power,
``then it might go beyond the year 2000.''
	   In the courtroom, Judge Augustine Paul barred Mazlan Mohamed
Din, an assistant police commissioner who was on the witness stand,
from reading aloud a lurid account of Anwar's alleged sexual
encounters with his private secretary's wife.
	   ``This evidence is being introduced solely for its prejudicial
value,'' defense attorney Christopher Fernando complained. ``It
certainly has no probative value.''
	   Judge Paul agreed, stipulating that the documents would be
entered into the trial record, but not read aloud in the crowded
courtroom.
	   Mazlan then proceeded to describe how Anwar's former driver,
Azizan Abu Bakar, defended the truthfulness of a letter in which he
described being sodomized by Anwar last year.
	   ``He (Azizan) clasped the Koran, swearing that if he lied he
would be cursed by Allah. He swore that what was contained in the
letter is true,'' Mazlan told the court. ``Since it was a Muslim
who swore using the Koran, I find that convincing.''
	   Anwar supporters seated in the courtroom groaned at the witness'
use of religion to buttress his testimony.
	   Under questioning by the prosecution, Mazlan said Anwar gave
police direct orders to force Azizan and another key witness to
withdraw their allegations of sexual misconduct.
	   The trial will be suspended during next week's summit of Pacific
Rim leaders in Kuala Lumpur, some of whom may be meeting with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. Any such meetings are likely to
infuriate the Malaysian government, which doesn't want the Anwar
case to become a sideshow to the summit talks.
	   Judge Paul has rejected defense attempts to show the former
Malaysian deputy prime minister is the victim of a political
conspiracy and trumped-up charges.
	   Anwar maintains the sex and corruption charges against him stem
from his rivalry with Prime Minister Mahathir.
	   He says Mahathir is losing support both at home and abroad.
	   ``Foreign leaders can no longer tolerate him any more. He's
becoming recalcitrant,'' Anwar said. He said many Malaysians also
rejected Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir, 72, has defended his sacking of Anwar as the country's
No. 2 official in September, and said he believed Anwar would
receive a fair trial.

Red Cross chief appeals for more help for North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A senior Red Cross official appealed
Thursday for more international aid to North Korea, saying it is at
risk of losing its youngest and oldest generations to famine.
	   ``My call to the world is to continue support to North Korea to
avoid catastrophe,'' said Astrid Heiberg, president of the
International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.
	   Heiberg said she visited several orphanages and nursing homes
during a visit to North Korea last week and saw many children and
elderly people suffering from malnutrition.
	   She told a news conference that many people are forced to eat
what she described as ``cattle food,'' a mixture of soybeans,
acorns, grass and herbs that can create severe stomach illnesses.
	   ``All non-governmental organizations and U.N. agencies agree
that the situation there is critical,'' Heiberg said. ``Unless
North Korea gets help from outside, it is in danger of losing the
younger and older generations.''
	   Heiberg said North Korea, entering its fourth winter of chronic
food shortages, harvested only 3 million tons of grain this year,
about two-thirds of the minimum needed by its 23 million people.
	   Heiberg, a Norwegian, met with Prime Minister Kim Jong-pil and
other ranking South Korean officials to appeal for more food aid
for the North.
	   South Korea has given its northern rival dlrs 315 million in
food since the communist nation turned to the international
community to feed its people in 1995.

Indonesian assembly debates as student protesters march
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with delegates debating proposal to step up Suharto
probe; many Indonesians use one name only &QL;

 &UR; By CHRISTOPHER TORCHIA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Government delegates debated Thursday
whether to escalate an investigation of former President Suharto as
student protesters marched in the streets, demanding that he be put
on trial without delay.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto, meanwhile, appealed for restraint
in the wake of clashes this week pitting students against riot
police and government-backed civilian guards.
	   But 2,000 students gathered at the University of Indonesia on
the third day of rallies against a meeting of Indonesia's highest
legislative body, which has pledged to overhaul a rigid political
system.
	   Activists are skeptical that the People's Consultative Assembly,
which is meeting in the green-domed Parliament, is willing to shake
off its legacy as an authoritarian instrument of Suharto.
	   The former army general quit in May after riots and protests
against his 32-year rule, and student protesters want him charged
with human rights abuses and corruption.
	   A minority faction in the assembly, the Muslim-based United
Development Party, argued Thursday in favor of approving a decree
that would authorize an investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   The ruling Golkar party has proposed an anti-corruption decree
that does not refer to Suharto by name.
	   A decree targeting Suharto would bolster an investigation of his
business holdings that is already under way. Government prosecutors
say they have found no wrongdoing, although critics say Suharto's
children crafted huge business empires at the expense of the state.
	   Students say the government, led by President B.J. Habibie and
other former Suharto proteges, is too compromised by its links to
the former president to properly investigate him.
	   Violence erupted Wednesday when a car carrying student activists
plowed into a group of riot officers, injuring nine and prompting
enraged soldiers to fire warning shots and to club protesters.
	   Wiranto apologized for the beatings of several protesters and
three local news photographers, one of whom he visited in a
hospital.
	   The male driver of the car, a student from the prestigious
University of Indonesia, was arrested. His family said he had
panicked and accelerated into a soldiers' barricade after officers
rapped on his car with sticks.
	   On Thursday, security forces closed off roads around Parliament,
where the assembly will draw up rules for 1999 general elections.
Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on duty in the capital this
week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day meeting Tuesday. Critics
suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president next
year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the 1,000-member assembly, which includes
parliamentary legislators and presidential appointees, are also
discussing whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role
in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   In May, deadly riots erupted across Jakarta when military
personnel fatally shot four student protesters. The unrest was
fueled by discontent over Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades.

Opposition strike claims seven lives, 500 injured in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Three more people have been killed and
nearly 200 injured in clashes between political rivals in the
closing hours of a three-day strike, news reports said Thursday.
	   The killings raised the death toll to seven, with more than 500
injured, during the 60-hour strike that ended Wednesday. It is
longest opposition-led shutdown since Sheikh Hasina's government
came to power more than two years ago.
	   Business leaders claimed the strike cost the economy 3 billion
taka (dlrs 68 million) per day in lost revenue.
	   In Dhaka, The Bangladesh Observer quoted witnesses as saying a
rickshaw puller and a shopkeeper were killed by a bomb during a
battle Wednesday between rival groups. In the southwestern port
city of Khulna, an opposition party leader was hacked to death.
Shops, houses and cars were set alight in retaliation.
	   Elsewhere Wednesday, violence struck the cities of Chittagong,
Habiganj, Comilla, Gazipur, Mymensingh, Narayanganj and Jessore,
all involving injuries. Scores of people were arrested.
	   The strike was called ostensibly to protest police action in
breaking up an opposition rally last Saturday led by former Prime
Minister Khaleda Zia.
	   But the backdrop was Sunday's court verdict convicting and
sentencing to death 15 former military officers for leading a 1975
coup and assassinating Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's
independence leader and first president.
	   Rahman's daughter, Sheikh Hasina, vowed to bring the coup
plotters to trial after she became prime minister in 1996. Hasina
has always claimed Mrs. Zia's late husband and another former
president, General Ziaur Rahman, was in on the plot.

Malone wants to play elsewhere
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN NADEL &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ After 13 outstanding years with the Utah
Jazz, Karl Malone has decided it's time to play elsewhere.
	   Malone, one of the best power forwards in NBA history, said on
his radio show Wednesday he no longer wants to play for the Jazz.
	   An 11-time All-Star who led Utah to the NBA Finals each of the
last two seasons, Malone has one year remaining on his contract
with the Jazz.
	   ``I am tired of the posturing and jabbering back and forth, and
I will go out on a limb and say, when the lockout is over with, I
will make a demand to be traded,'' Malone said on the air. ``I will
say it right now, I have played my last game in Salt Lake City, and
it's time for Karl to move on.''
	   With extra time on his hands, Malone is in his third week as an
afternoon talk-show host two hours a day Mondays through Fridays
for radio station KXTA in Los Angeles.
	   ``There have been things done and said in Utah, and I don't
really think I can play there anymore,'' he said. ``I'm almost sure
I can't play there anymore.
	   ``I would rather go somewhere else, and there's not a lot of
places I can go to. I would love to have an opportunity to play
with the Lakers, either when this lockout is over with or when I
become a free agent.''
	   Malone averaged 27.0 points and 10.3 rebounds in 81
regular-season games last season. In 1,061 career games, he is
averaging 26.2 points and 10.7 rebounds.
	   Jazz spokesman Mark Kelly said he couldn't comment on Malone's
remarks because of the gag order that prohibits comment by team
officials on player matters.
	   Malone placed much of the blame for his feelings on the media in
Utah, saying he would never do another interview for reporters from
Salt Lake City.
	   Malone is doing his show this week from a radio station in
Arkansas, where he is on a hunting trip.
	   Malone's radio show had been carried on KALL-AM in Salt Lake
City since the day after its inception, but that stopped Wednesday.
Station manager Lee Douglas said Malone's agent, Dwight Manley,
asked that the station pay for the show, and ``we had not budgeted
for it.''
	   When he started the show, Malone said one of the conditions was
that it be carried in Utah.

Indians abroad to help finance 7,000-kilometer (4,000-mile) highway
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NEELESH MISRA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ India will tap expatriates' wealth to
finance one of its largest infrastructure projects, a
7,000-kilometer (4,350-mile) highway connecting the farthest ends
of the country, Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee said Thursday.
	   Work is to begin before the end of the year on the six-lane
highway network, running north-south and east-west, which will cost
280 billion rupees (dlrs 6.6 billion), Vajpayee said at a
conference of Indian expatriates. He did not say when it was
expected to be completed.
	   ``We will in the near future create financial instruments to
channelize your savings and investments in this grand development
project,'' Vajpayee said, addressing hundreds of Indian businessmen
living in 25 countries, assembled for the Global Indian
Entrepreneurs Conference.
	   ``We have the will and the means and the technical know-how to
undertake this project,'' he said, inviting domestic and foreign
private business to pump in funds.
	   Vajpayee said the highway network would save 150 billion rupees
(dlrs 3.6 billion) each year in fuel. A similar amount would be
saved in repairs for vehicles now torn apart on India's ill-kept
roads.
	   India's infrastructure bottlenecks are seen as a deterrent for
foreign investors since New Delhi launched an ambitious economic
reforms program in 1991.
	   Vajpayee said the government would soon announce a new
telecommunications policy, further liberalizing rules for private
investment.
	   The government's focus on infrastructure development is aimed at
lifting the gloom in India's business and industry, now struggling
with a slowdown. The federal Commerce Ministry last week reported a
negative growth of more than 4 percent during the first six months
of the 1998-99 fiscal year ending March 31.
	   Stunned by the unexpected dlrs. 4.5 billion sales of its
Resurgent India Bonds issued for expatriates earlier this year, the
government has now turned to the prosperous community known as
Non-Resident Indians for funds for projects to energize the
economy.
	   About 17 million Indian expatriates have an estimated net worth
of dlrs 1.5 trillion, said Sudhir Jalan, president of the
Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry which hosted
the conference.

Japan's opposition to free-trade pact worries APEC officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 9th graf to add quote about Japan not compromising; ADDS
grafs 13-14 with comment from Australian trade minister warning of
protectionism &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A South Korean official criticized
Japan Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' when leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit meeting on Tuesday
and Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   On Thursday, senior APEC officials began a two-day meeting to
hash out the agenda that Cabinet ministers will approve this
weekend for the summit meeting by the 21 leaders.
	   An official with the Japanese delegation, speaking on condition
of anonymity, said Japan would not budge.
	   ``Japan won't change its position on the forestry and fishing
sectors,'' the official said. ``We won't compromise, either.''
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has accused Japan
of trying to derail the pact, saying it will fall apart unless the
world's second-largest economy approves all nine sectors.
	   The South Korean official at Thursday's APEC meeting said his
government supports the free-trade agreement, but could have
trouble selling it back home if Japan refuses to open its fishing
market. South Korea, one of worst victims of the Asian economic
crisis, relies as heavily on fishing as Japan does, and their
fishermen often share the same waters.
	   The official said other countries in the region also could have
trouble selling the agreement to their people, given how much they
already are suffering under Asia's 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer warned Thursday that
Japan's approach could unleash protectionist forces.
	   ``I think the threat of slippage with regard to trade worldwide
is very real,'' Fischer said. ``I think that would be a disastrous
course, which would merely extend the present economic
difficulties.''
	   After the APEC summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to
travel to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Just like last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis
that also has hurt Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   The United States has battled to keep the APEC response to the
crisis on the free-market road that the International Monetary Fund
has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, is expected to lead a counter assault on this free-market
philosophy, arguing that the IMF prescription has failed to halt
the crisis and has instead left many countries in deep recessions
with little prospect of an early recovery.
	   Mahathir would like endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets.
	   Those two views are likely to dominate the discussions during
the APEC summit, but are expected to be papered over before the
final statement is issued.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Prince returning to Cambodia; king calls Thursday night summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with Ranariddh's departure; ADDS king's
letter in grafs 9-10 &QL; 
 &UR; By KER MUNTHIT &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh headed back to Cambodia Thursday, optimistic that a
summit hastily called by the king can break rival parties' deadlock
over forming a new government.
	   ``I think definitely we will be part of the national coalition
government, definitely, yes,'' Ranariddh told reporters as he left
Bangkok, Thailand, on a midafternoon flight for Phnom Penh.
	   Ranariddh, head of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, was to meet his
political rivals, led by strongman Hun Sen, for an evening summit
under the auspices of King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   The summit, to be held at the Royal Palace to allay Ranariddh's
concerns for his security, could mark an important step toward
breaking the political impasse Cambodia has suffered since
parliamentary elections in July.
	   Ranariddh and his opposition ally, former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy, have rejected the narrow victory by Hun Sen's ruling
Cambodian People's Party and left the country without a legal
government. Badly needed foreign aid has been delayed.
	   Chea Sim, the CPP's president and speaker of the National
Assembly, was expected to join in Thursday's meetings. The assembly
presidency is a key dispute blocking agreement on a coalition
government.
	   The summit was hastily convened after Ranariddh and Chea Sim
asked Sihanouk in writing earlier Thursday to organize it.
	   The king, 76, had turned up pressure on both sides to start a
new round of negotiations by announcing plans to leave for China
Saturday to undergo treatment for his numerous ailments. Sihanouk
is the only Cambodian leader capable of brokering a deal.
	   In a letter Thursday to Ranariddh _ his son _ the king wrote
that ``Papa is very grateful and would like to appreciate your
correct decision to give a consideration to our nation's and
people's interests.''
	   The letter said the talks would continue through Friday, and
that Ranariddh would stay inside the Royal Palace during his stay.
	   Previous talks have broken down in acrimony rooted in Hun Sen's
ouster of Ranariddh as his co-prime minister in a bloody coup in
July 1997.
	   In the elections, the CPP failed to win the two-thirds majority
that would have enabled it to form a government alone. Ranariddh
and Sam Rainsy, the junior opposition leader, alleged electoral
fraud and intimidation and withheld their support.
	   Both opposition leaders and many of their supporters fled the
country after the new National Assembly was formally sworn in Sept.
24, saying they feared arrest. They dismissed Hun Sen's guarantees
that they would be safe to return.
	   Sihanouk tried to break the impasse last week, offering the
opposition use of his palace for security and saying royal guards
could escort the leaders to and from the airport.
	   On Wednesday, Hun Sen addressed opposition fears of arrest on
trumped-up charges by saying that members of parliament enjoy full
immunity. He predicted a summit would enjoy success under the
king's ``clear-sighted guidance.''
	   Ranariddh said in a letter to Sihanouk that the safety
guarantees were ``sufficient.'' There was no immediate word from
Sam Rainsy, who is in Europe, but his 15 seats are not vital to the
formation of a two-thirds majority in the 122-member assembly.
	   FUNCINPEC and the CPP have agreed on an agenda, proposing that
the issues of selecting leadership in the National Assembly and a
program for a new government be discussed, party leaders have said.

American kidnapped in southern Russia

	   MAKACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ An American teacher and missionary has
been kidnapped in a southern Russian region bordering the breakaway
republic of Chechnya by unidentified abductors who made no
immediate demands, officials said Thursday.
	   Herbert Cregg, 51, was abducted on Wednesday night in
Makhachkala, the capital of the Dagestan province on the Caspian
Sea.
	   A youth said he saw four attackers forcing Cregg into a car with
tinted windows and driving away. The boy alerted police, who began
a massive search effort, said Allahverdi Akilov, a local police
official in charge of combating organized crime.
	   Cregg and his wife Linda have been living in Dagestan for the
past four years. Both have been teaching English to university
students, and he has also been involved in charity and missionary
activities.
	   Cregg helped pay for construction of a sports hall at a local
school, and was coaching its basketball team. He was kidnapped
right after attending basketball practice on Wednesday, Akilov
said.
	   Cregg's wife said the pair had received no threats or extortion
demands in the past.
	   Sheikh Ismailov, president of Dagestan's Pedagogical University,
said Cregg and his wife had worked under a contract with a U.S.
foundation called Social and Cultural Progress, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Dagestan has remained restive, plagued by frequent kidnappings,
shootings, bombings and other violent crimes. Many kidnappings have
been linked to militants coming from neighboring Chechnya, which
fought a war with Russia from 194-96.
	   Hundreds of Russians and foreigners have been kidnapped in and
around Chechnya in recent years by gangs seeking ransom, and dozens
remain in captivity.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew two years ago. No country has recognized Chechnya's
independence, and Moscow insists the territory is still part of
Russia.

Report: U.S. book giant Borders to open second Singapore store
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ U.S. book store giant Borders will open a
second outlet in Singapore after initial success in its first
overseas venture, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   Since opening last November, the store has sold more than
600,000 books in Singapore _ about one for every five citizens _
and sales have substantially exceeded the company's minimum target
of 25 million Singapore dollars (dlrs 15 million), said The Straits
Times.
	   Local management declined to specify when the company would open
the second, slightly smaller store to complement its existing
31,000 square-foot (2,790 square-meter) outlet, which stocks about
130,000 book titles and 60,000 music CD titles.
	   Total sales and profits in its Singapore operations were not
revealed.
	   New York-based Borders Group Inc. is one of the largest book
retailers in the United States, and has ventured into Britain and
Australia since opening the Singapore store.
	   Borders' Singapore executive general manager Matthew Coyne told
the newspaper that the company is setting up a 3,500 square-foot
(315 square-meter) warehouse and distribution center that may be
expanded in the future if other regional outlets are opened.
	   He added that the group is considering Australian outlets in
Sydney, Canberra and Perth in addition to its existing Melbourne
operation. An Auckland, New Zealand, store is also planned.

Blair issues fresh warning to Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair issued a fresh
warning to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein on Thursday of imminent
military strikes, saying that ``the next step is action.''
	   ``We have been through the threats and the strong words,'' Blair
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ``He has got
to come back into compliance or action will follow.''
	   Britain and the United States have repeatedly threatened the use
of force if Iraq doesn't back down in the latest standoff over
United Nations weapons inspections.
	   On Oct. 31, Saddam decided to halt all work by the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees the dismantling of Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
before U.N. sanctions can be lifted. But Baghdad has said the
disarmament work cannot resume until the U.N. Security Council
gives a timetable for lifting the economic sanctions imposed after
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   ``We can't allow such a situation to happen,'' Blair said. ``It
isn't a question of making great threats anymore. It is a question
of stating very clearly that he in breach of his agreement. That
breach is important and it is important that we act as necessary to
restore the compliance.''
	   President Bill Clinton yesterday ordered additional military
buildup, while Britain joined the United States in urging their
citizens to evacuate the area.
	   The U.N. Security Council also held an emergency session on Iraq
on Wednesday, giving its support to the secretary-general's call on
Saddam to immediately resume cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   ``It is with the utmost regret that we find ourselves in this
position,'' Blair told the BBC. ``We have bent over backwards to
try to accommodate any reasonable demands. But we can't carry on
with a situation where he is developing chemical-biological weapons
of warfare _ and after all, he is a person who has used them _ and
the international community stands by and does nothing.''
	   On Wednesday, British Defense Secretary George Robertson said
that during his recent visit to the Gulf, he found Arab nations
were increasingly supportive of taking tough action against Iraq.

Turkish government at brink of collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The minority government was on the brink
of collapse Thursday after a key party defected to the opposition
camp over a privatization scandal.
	   Deniz Baykal, leader of the Republican People's Party, was to
file a no-confidence motion Thursday against Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz. Two other opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions a
day earlier, accusing Yilmaz of abuse of powers and ties to
organized crime. The no-confidence motions were not expected to be
debated before next week.
	   A businessman linked to the mafia claimed Yilmaz interfered in
the privatization of a state-run bank by pledging him loans that
would ensure that his was the highest bid.
	   Yilmaz has maintained that he wanted to keep the mafia out of
the deal and was trying to get the highest price possible from the
sale. Yilmaz has repeatedly said he would not resign. However, with
no hope of surviving opposition moves to bring him down, it was
unclear he would change his mind and quit.
	   ``I am a minority government, I cannot resist. If Baykal
withdraws support that is the end of the government,'' Yilmaz said
early Thursday speaking on private Kanal D television.
	   ``The Republicans are toppling,'' Daily Hurriyet headlined while
Milliyet newspaper said: ``The premier is in trouble.''
	   It was also unclear who would be appointed to replace Yilmaz's
government until elections scheduled for April. Daily Sabah
suggested President Suleyman Demirel would appoint an interim
government of independent, non-partisan figures.
	   Yilmaz came to power in July 1997 after the military pressured
an Islamic-led government out of office for its anti-secular
policies. With the backing of the Republicans, Yilmaz has since
then been campaigning against radical Islam and organized crime, at
the urging of the military.
	   Turkey has witnessed the collapse of three governments since the
last elections held in 1995.

Indonesian leader urged to end violence in East Timor

 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A coalition of Asian activists
urged Indonesia's president Thursday to put an end to violence in
East Timor.
	   At a meeting in Kuala Lumpur to commemorate the anniversary of a
1991 massacre of anti-Indonesian protesters, activists denounced an
offer by President B.J. Habibie to give East Timor some autonomy in
exchange for recognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over the region.
	   ``We call for the Habibie administration to take genuine steps
for a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' said Nadiah Bamadhaj, of
the Malaysian East Timor Solidarity Group.
	   Seven years ago, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independence
protesters in Dili, the East Timor capital. A government report put
the death toll at 50. Human rights activists say about 200 people
were killed.
	   Activists also urged the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group
to address the problem. APEC officials have begun meeting in Kuala
Lumpur ahead of the Nov. 17-18 summit.
	   ``There is still ongoing struggle in East Timor,'' said Gus
Miclat, of the Manila-based Asia-Pacific Coalition for East Timor.
``We hope the APEC leaders would address that.''
	   The coalition called for the release of the nearly 200 jailed
activists, including rebel leader Xanana Gusmao. He is serving a
20-year prison term for fighting Indonesian troops.
	   They planned to stage a candlelight vigil later Thursday in
front of the Indonesian Embassy in Kuala Lumpur.
	   Meanwhile, some 10,000 mourners gathered at a graveyard in Dili,
the provincial capital of East Timor, to lay flowers on the graves
of the dead. They lit candles as police watched from a distance.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule.

Disputed Kuril Islands to dominate Russian-Japanese summit

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leaders of Russia and Japan set out Thursday
to resolve a conflict that has divided their nations for more than
half a century _ the ownership of the disputed Kuril Islands.
	   Russian President Boris Yeltsin warmly greeted Japanese Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi at the Kremlin, where Yeltsin was expected to
deliver his long-awaited response to Japan's proposals to resolve
the Kurils dispute.
	   While there could be progress on the Kurils, reaching a final
agreement is expected to be a long, difficult process.
	   The two leaders were expected to sign previously resolved
agreements on investment protection and cooperation in transport,
tourism and environmental protection.
	   ``It's good that our agreements are being implemented. I think
we should fulfill the program,'' Yeltsin said at the outset of the
meeting, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   But the main task before the leaders was resolution of the
dispute over the Kuril chain, which consists of four islands. The
islands, known to Japanese as the Northern Territories, were once
held by Tokyo but have been controlled by Moscow since the end of
World War II.
	   Both nations claim ownership, and the dispute is the main reason
the two haven't signed a formal peace treaty ending the war.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented new
proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan
in April. The proposals have not been made public. According to
media reports, Tokyo has suggested an arrangement that would
recognize Japanese sovereignty, but would allow Russia to retain
control for some time.
	   Yeltsin has long stalled, but was expected to finally give an
answer in his closed-door meeting with Obuchi, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.
	   The Kremlin does not intend to disclose the proposal or
Yeltsin's response, ITAR-Tass said. The agency said Yeltsin might
offer several alternatives.
	   During their summit in Krasnoyarsk in November 1997, Yeltsin and
Hashimoto pledged to make the utmost effort to sign a peace treaty
by 2000. But Japan wants the treaty to spell out the status of the
Kurils.
	   ``I believe that our generation carries the responsibility for
making sure that the problems that have arisen in this century are
solved before it is over and are not shifted to the shoulders of
our children and grandchildren,'' Obuchi told the Russian daily
newspaper Izvestia in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in contention _
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty
with Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing
days of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since as
illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 Russian inhabitants, but the
waters around them are rich fishing grounds.
	   The summit was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting since his
latest illness sidelined him a month ago. The president's office
said Wednesday that the 67-year-old leader planned to visit Japan
next spring or summer.
	   Japan has announced plans to give an dlrs 800 million loan to
Russia. The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. But the
IMF and the World Bank have put their loans on hold after Russia
succumbed to economic crisis in August.
	   No timetable has been set for the release of the Japanese loan,
but Obuchi's spokesman Sadaaki Numata said it ``would not be a
months-long wait.''

	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Joel Sanchez scored twice to lead Chivas of
Guadalajara past Argentina's Gimnasia y Esgrima de La Plata 2-1
Wednesday night in the final of the Coliseum Cup soccer tournament
in front of a crowd of 25,299.
	   Sanchez's second goal broke a 1-1 tie in the 54th minute.
Goalkeeper Guillermo Hernando deflected Ricardo Pelaez's header off
Ramon Ramirez's free kick. But the rebound went through the legs of
Gimnasia's Ruben Ferrer, and Sanchez converted at the right post.
	   Ferrer had tied the score four minutes earlier. Dario Aurelio
chipped a ball between two defenders to Ferrer. Sanchez deflected
the ball but fell, and Ferrer scored from four yards (3.6 meters)
on a left-footed shot.
	   Sanchez's first goal came in the 29th minute. After a defender
deflected Paolo Cesar Chavez's corner kick, Sanchez stepped between
two defenders for a diving header from six yards.
	   Gimnasia y Esgrima had a chance to tie the score in the 63rd
minute, but Siro Darino's 30-yard line drive hit the left post.
	   Chivas played with 10 men in the final 24 minutes after Chavez
received his second yellow card for a dangerous tackle on Dario
Cavallo.
	   Both clubs hold second place in the overall standings of their
respective national leagues.

Thousands of students march against Indonesian assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more detail on student protests. Many Indonesians
use one name only &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Yelling pro-democracy slogans, at
least 10,000 students marched in downtown Jakarta Thursday in the
largest protest so far against a government assembly.
	   A police helicopter hovered over the marchers. Shopkeepers
fearful of violence pulled down their shutters and many office
workers went home early. There were no reports of unrest.
	   This week, several protests have ended in clashes pitting
students against riot police and government-backed civilian guards.
	   A few kilometers (miles) away at Parliament, government
delegates debated whether to escalate an investigation of former
President Suharto, who was unseated by riots and student protests
in May.
	   Activists are skeptical that the People's Consultative Assembly
is willing to shake off its legacy as Suharto's authoritarian
instrument and implement democratic reforms as it has promised.
	   The assembly, which is Indonesia's highest legislative body and
includes all 500 members of Parliament, has pledged to craft rules
for 1999 general elections by the end of this week.
	   The delegates, many of whom loyally served Suharto, have come
under pressure to hold their onetime mentor accountable for
wrongdoing during his 32 years in power.
	   A minority faction in the assembly, the Muslim-based United
Development Party, argued in favor of approving a decree that would
authorize an investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   The ruling Golkar party has proposed an anti-corruption decree
that does not refer to Suharto by name.
	   A decree targeting Suharto would bolster an investigation of his
business holdings that is already under way. Government prosecutors
say they have found no wrongdoing, although critics allege that
Suharto's children crafted huge business empires at state expense.
	   Students say the government, led by President B.J. Habibie and
other former Suharto proteges, is too compromised by its links to
the former president to properly investigate him.
	   At the street rally, students waved red and white Indonesian
flags and shouted slogans including, ``Habibie must step down and
Suharto must take responsibility.''
	   Thousands of people stood by, watching the marchers and
occasionally clapping and cheering. Barred by security forces from
marching to Parliament, the students took a circuitous route along
main roads, some in densely populated poor areas.
	   ``We will keep on protesting if our demands are not fulfilled,''
said demonstrator Lufti.
	   In heavy rain, riot officers with sticks and shields tried to
block the marchers in at least two locations, but pulled back,
apparently overwhelmed by the large number of protesters.
	   Violence erupted Wednesday when a car carrying student activists
plowed into a group of riot officers, injuring nine and prompting
enraged soldiers to fire warning shots and to club protesters.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto apologized for the beatings of
several protesters and three local news photographers, one of whom
he visited in a hospital.
	   On Thursday, security forces set up roadblocks and closed off
roads around Parliament. Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on
duty in the capital this week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day assembly meeting Tuesday.
Critics suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president
next year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the 1,000-member assembly, which includes
parliamentary legislators and presidential appointees, are also
discussing whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role
in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   In May, deadly riots erupted across Jakarta when military
personnel fatally shot four student protesters. The unrest was
fueled by discontent over Indonesia's worst economic crisis in
decades.

Saudi executed for murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ A Saudi man convicted of murder was
executed Thursday, the Interior Ministry said.
	   Hasan al-Kanani al-Zahrani was beheaded in southwest Saudi
Arabia for shooting to death a fellow tribesman, Saeed bin Yahya
al-Kanani al-Zahrani, after an argument, a ministry statement said.
	   Al-Zahrani's execution in Riyadh raised to 24 the number of
beheadings in the kingdom this year. Last year 124 people were
executed.
	   Saudi Arabia's Islamic courts impose the death sentence for
murder, rape, drug trafficking and armed robbery. Executions are
carried out with a sword in public.
	   Human rights groups have criticized the executions, saying that
suspects do not receive fair trials, are denied lawyers and do not
have the right to appeal.

Two oil sketches by British artist missing from museum
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Two 19th century oil sketches by British artist
John Constable are missing from their museum home in London,
according to newspaper reports published Thursday.
	   The sketches, worth about 800,000 pounds (dlrs 1.3 million),
were last seen in a storeroom in August at the Victoria and Albert
Museum and are now believed to have been stolen, said museum
director Alan Borg.
	   The works, ``Dedham Lock and Mill'' (circa 1810-1815) and
``Sketch for Valley Farm,'' (circa 1835) are considered by art
experts as too well-known to be sold, the newspapers reported.
	   Both works were given to the museum by Constable's daughter in
1888.
	   Timothy Stevens, the museum's assistant director of collections,
said a ``comprehensive search'' of the gallery's works failed to
locate the sketches.
	   ``Theft has therefore been identified as the most likely
cause,'' he said.
	   The police and the Art Loss Register have been informed.
	   Earlier this year, an 18th century Oriental vase was stolen from
the museum's display area. It was later recovered after a couple's
arrest.

Tokyo stocks fall on disappointment over stimulus plan, dollar
</HEADLINE>
rises &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Wraps up with late dollar, closing bond, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Tokyo share prices fell sharply Thursday as
investors found nothing fresh in the Japanese ruling party's
proposed economic stimulus package. The U.S. dollar rose against
the yen on speculation the United States was planning to attack
Iraq.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average shed 352.96 points,
or 2.45 percent, closing at 14,075.06. On Wednesday, the index had
gained 319.93 points, or 2.27 percent.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 123.22 yen, up 2.10 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its late New York level
of 121.72 yen overnight.
	   On the stock market, selling accelerated in the afternoon as
many investors found no new encouragement in measures proposed by
the governing Liberal Democratic Party to help lift Japan out of
recession, traders said. Almost all elements of the package had
already been leaked to local media in recent days.
	   ``There is a feeling of slight disappointment,'' said Masaaki
Higashida, deputy general manager of investment information and
services at Nomura Securities.
	   The opposition Liberal Party is pushing for a cut in the 5
percent consumption tax, but it could meet opposition from the LDP.
	   The centerpiece of the LDP package is 10 trillion yen (dlrs 82
billion) in public works-related spending through next March and 4
trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts next year.
	   With planned corporate tax cuts and other tax relief measures
included, the package likely would total a record 18 trillion yen
(dlrs 148 billion). In line with the LDP's package, the government
plans to announce a set of measures to stimulate the nation's
economy next Monday.
	   Trading was moderate, with about 404 million shares changing
hands on the first section, up from Wednesday's 386 million.
Declines outnumbered advances 778 to 361, with 139issues unchanged.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was down 15.19 points, or 1.38 percent, to 1,082.93.
It had gained 19.8 points, or 1.84 percent, the previous day.
	   Meanwhile, traders rushed to buy dollars following a CBS News
report quoting White House sources as saying that while a military
attack was not likely in the next 12 hours, an aerial assault could
come as early as Thursday.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
strike since Iraq said late last month it was stopping the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for
eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. forces in the Gulf region beefing up, President Bill
Clinton said that not enforcing U.N. demands for arms inspections
would be a costly mistake.
	   The dollar, regarded as a safe haven, often strengthens at times
of international tension.
	   The yen came under renewed selling pressure from investors'
disappointment in the LDP's proposed stimulus package, market
players said.
	   The dollar ranged between 121.42 yen and 123.32 yen in
Thursday's trading.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond fell to 0.820 percent from Wednesday's finish of 0.855
percent, driving its price up to 108.71 yen from 108.37 yen.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the broadest effort yet to jumpstart the world's
second-largest economy, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
ruling party outlined plans Thursday for the country's biggest
stimulus package ever.
	   The Liberal Democratic Party proposals will form the basis of an
official government plan to be formally announced on Monday and
expected to be passed later this month in a special session of
Parliament.
	   The centerpiece of the party's package calls for 10 trillion yen
(dlrs 81 billion) in public works-related spending through next
March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income tax cuts next
year.
	   With the addition of corporate tax cuts and other tax relief
measures, it was expected to total a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs
147 billion).
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi Sakaiya,
said Thursday that the government plan will likely include a mix of
tax cuts worth about 7 trillion yen (dlrs 57 billion).
	   The widely expected package was compiled in a bid to prevent
Japan's economy from shrinking for a third consecutive year and to
fulfill Obuchi's pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   One million new jobs were expected to be created once the new
economic package has been implemented, the governing party said.
	   Many private economists were also skeptical the stimulus
measures would put Japan back on track for solid recovery.
	   ``It's just enough to prevent further deterioration,'' said
Cameron Uematsu, senior economist in the Tokyo office of Warburg
Dillon Read. He added that it was ``clearly not sufficient'' to
pull the economy out of the doldrums.
	   _____
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ A South Korean official criticized
Japan Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' when leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit meeting on Tuesday
and Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.

	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ Employers should cut expenses and avoid layoffs
by reducing salaries and contributions to pension funds, the
government-dominated National Wages Council said Thursday.
	   The council recommended 5 percent to 8 percent wage reductions
this year compared to 1997 and cutting employer contributions to
the mandatory state-run pension fund from 20 percent of a worker's
salary to 10 percent.
	   The cuts match recent recommendations from the Ministry of Trade
and Industry and the Committee on Singapore's Competitiveness.
Government and local companies are widely expected to adopt the
measures.
	   The wage council _ which represents unions, businesses and
government _ said Singapore risks severely damaging the economy
unless it reins in rising labor costs.
	   ``As an export-oriented economy with external demand accounting
for about 70 percent of total demand, preserving our
cost-competitiveness is crucial for economic growth,'' it
cautioned.
	   ``We need to reduce our (labor) cost quickly to tide over the
difficult period, preserve jobs and strengthen our
competitiveness.''
	   Singapore has slipped into a technical recession, its first
downturn since the last economic contraction in the mid-80s. As
exports and business profits have fallen, layoffs have risen to
record levels and unemployment has doubled to 4.5 percent.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ The La Nina weather phenomenon may cut
rice production in 10 Indonesian provinces as excessive rain could
delay or affect rice harvests next year, a local newspaper reported
Thursday.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted Chairil Anwar Rasahan, director general
of food crops and horticulture at the Ministry of Agriculture, as
saying rice production could drop significantly.
	   The provinces, which account for half of Indonesia's total
output, are Aceh, north and south Sumatra, Lampung, west, central
and east Java, west and east Kalimantan and south Sulawesi.
	   La Nina threatens to bring floods and tropical storms to
Indonesia, which has previously been struck by droughts from the
opposite weather phenomenon, El Nino.
	   During the El Nino cycle last year, Indonesia experienced its
worst drought in 50 years, setting off uncontrolled fires on
Sumatra and Kalimantan.
	   Harvest failure forced the country to import 4.1 million tons of
rice this fiscal year.
	   ____
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Singapore has just announced a major
cost-cutting package that could make it more competitive than Hong
Kong in some areas, but Hong Kong's chief executive says he won't
follow suit by ordering pay cuts.
	   Despite intense competition between the rival Asian financial
centers, Chief Executive Tung Chee-hwa said the territory's wages
are set by the market, not the government.
	   ``Our wages are adjusted by market forces,'' Tung said in
remarks carried Thursday by local newspapers. ``The government has
no intention whatsoever of issuing such instructions because Hong
Kong is a free market.''
	   Tung's assurances could ring hollow to many private sector
workers. Numerous companies in Hong Kong already have cut wages by
as much as 20 percent as the territory struggles through a
recession that has pushed unemployment to a 15-year high of 5
percent.
	   Singapore proposed measures Wednesday that would trim business
expenses by 10 billion Singapore dollars (U.S. dlrs 6 billion) a
year, reducing corporate costs by about 15 percent.
	   Drawn up to ease the pain of Singapore's first economic
recession in 13 years, the package recommends major cuts in wages
and pension contributions, reduced land and factory rentals,
slashed levies and service charges, and lower taxes.
	   The measures are the latest moves by Singapore that could lure
investors or employers away from Hong Kong.
	   Hong Kong and Singapore are also currently feuding over
Singapore's plans to launch new futures trading of a stock index
that virtually mirrors Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index.

Palestinians reject Israel's conditional ratification

to Middle East to supervise implementation, Israel issuing bids for
construction of Jewish neighborhood; changes byline &QL;

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A day after ratifying the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinian, Israel announced Thursday it would
begin construction of a large Jewish neighborhood in a sector of
Jerusalem claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital.
	   Palestinian spokesman Ahmed Tibi denounced the construction
plans as a violation of the peace accords that would ``bring a
serious response.'' He demanded that the United States intervene.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross is returning to the region to
supervise implementation of the peace agreement, and his first stop
is a meeting Friday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to give the
go-ahead for construction of the Har Homa neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem came after months of delay. It
was seen as an attempt to blunt the criticism by hard-line Cabinet
ministers, coalition allies and key constituents.
	   In a political blow to Netanyahu, the Wye accord was approved by
only eight of 17 Cabinet ministers, with four opposed. Five
ministers, all members of Netanyahu's Likud Party, abstained.
	   As the Cabinet voted Wednesday evening, thousands of Jewish
settlers staged a protest rally in Tel Aviv, and leading Likud
legislators said the time had come to topple Netanyahu.
	   Later this month, parliament is to vote on a bill to call early
elections, and several hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition
are expected to back the legislation.
	   In bringing the accord to the ministers, Netanyahu attached
several conditions that set the stage for new crises with the
Palestinians. He also threatened to annex parts of the West Bank if
the Palestinians declare independence unilaterally in May.
	   Under the peace deal, Israel is to begin a phased withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank on Monday in return for
Palestinian security measures against Islamic militants. The
withdrawal is to be completed by the end of January.
	   Netanyahu promised the ministers that the Cabinet will meet
before each stage of the pullback to vote on whether the
Palestinians were meeting Israel's security demands.
	   If not, ministers would have the option to halt the process by
voting against the next phase.
	   Netanyahu said the agreement would stop altogether if the
Palestine National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile,
does not hold a formal vote by mid-December to revoke clauses in
the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Under the agreement, the PNC is to convene to reaffirm changes
it voted on in April 1996 and does not mention a vote.
	   Any additional pullback would turn over no more than 1 percent
of the West Bank to Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat's control.
	   Wednesday's vote had been delayed several times, in part due to
a suicide bombing in Jerusalem by an Islamic militant last week.
Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the first pullback would
likely not begin for at least another week, following a
parliamentary vote scheduled on Tuesday.
	   Approval in the Knesset is necessary for Israel to begin the
withdrawal. With the conditions set by the Cabinet, the fragile
deal will likely face more obstacles before it is carried out.
	   Palestinian officials said the conditions were violations of the
accord signed in the presence of U.S. President Bill Clinton in
Washington on Oct. 23.
	   ``We spoke to the American administration and filed an official
complaint regarding the conditions. We asked Mr. Netanyahu before
to stop the threats and conditions, but he chose threats, which
means he does not want there to be trust between us,'' said an
angry Saeb Erekat, a senior Palestinian official who helped
negotiate the accord.

Japan's opposition to free-trade pact worries APEC officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Hong Kong APEC official defending
stance Japan is taking &QL; 
 &UR; By PRISCILLA CHEUNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Asian officials criticized
Japan Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' when leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' a South Korean official said in Kuala Lumpur. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit meeting Tuesday and
Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   On Thursday, senior APEC officials began a two-day meeting to
hash out the agenda that Cabinet ministers will approve this
weekend for the summit meeting by the 21 leaders.
	   An official with the Japanese delegation, also requesting
anonymity, said Japan would not budge.
	   ``Japan won't change its position on the forestry and fishing
sectors,'' the official said. ``We won't compromise, either.''
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has accused Japan
of trying to derail the pact, saying it will fall apart unless the
world's second-largest economy approves all nine sectors.
	   The South Korean official at Thursday's APEC meeting said his
government supports the free-trade agreement, but could have
trouble selling it back home if Japan refuses to open its fishing
market. South Korea, one of worst victims of the Asian economic
crisis, relies as heavily on fishing as Japan does, and their
fishermen often share the same waters.
	   The official said other countries in the region that support the
pact could end up in arguments over its nine sectors during the
APEC summit, given how much their countries already are suffering
under Asia's 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer warned Thursday that
Japan's approach could unleash protectionist forces.
	   ``I think the threat of slippage with regard to trade worldwide
is very real,'' Fischer said in Canberra, Australia. ``I think that
would be a disastrous course, which would merely extend the present
economic difficulties.''
	   But not everyone in the APEC delegation in Malaysia was critical
of Japan's stance.
	   Alan Lai, Hong Kong's director-general of trade, said Japan's
stubbornness would not necessarily derail the tariff plan, and he
urged other nations to be flexible when negotiating the agreement.
``I would not like to say that because of one particular economy
we're not making any progress,'' he told reporters.
	   After the APEC summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to
travel to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Just like last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis,
which also has hurt Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   The United States has battled to keep the APEC response to the
crisis on the free-market road that the International Monetary Fund
has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, is expected to lead a counter assault on this free-market
philosophy, arguing that the IMF prescription has failed to halt
the crisis and has instead left many countries in deep recessions
with little prospect of an early recovery.
	   Mahathir would like an endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets.
	   Those two views are likely to dominate the discussions during
the APEC summit, but are expected to be papered over before the
final statement is issued.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Ten hostages freed from Chechnya
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Ten hostages, five of them members of the Russian
security forces, have been released from the breakaway southern
territory of Chechnya, news reports said Thursday.
	   However, Chechen authorities denied that the 10 men had been
hostages. Mairbek Vachagayev, a spokesman for Chechen President
Aslan Maskhadov, claimed all were military deserters who had been
rounded up in southern regions surrounding Chechnya, the Interfax
news agency reported.
	   The 10 men were brought to Moscow on Thursday on a special
flight.
	   Boris Berezovsky, one of Russia's wealthiest and most
controversial businessmen, claimed credit for freeing the men.
Berezovsky, speaking to reporters at the airport, said no ransom
was paid.
	   Deputy Russian Interior Minister Vladimir Rushailo, who helped
negotiate the releases, said three of the men were army soldiers,
two served with the Interior Ministry troops, and five others were
civilians, including two Ukrainian citizens.
	   Berezovsky has helped win the release of dozens of hostages in
Chechnya in recent months, and Interior Minister Sergei Stepashin
publicly thanked him for his efforts.
	   However, Chechnya's president has claimed that Berezovsky paid
large ransoms to win the release of hostages, and thereby
encouraged kidnappers to take additional hostages for ransom.
	   ``He comes with suitcases full of money and heaps of computers
and bails out the captives,'' Maskhadov said recently. ``This only
stimulates the appetites of gangsters and discredits my nation.''
	   Whenever hostages are released, there are rumors about possible
ransom payments, but the parties involved rarely provide details.
	   Berezovsky has never acknowledged paying any ransoms. He said
that he and others have been sending humanitarian and medical aid,
computers and school textbooks to Chechnya, and in return, senior
Chechen officials have put more emphasis on identifying and
locating kidnappers.
	   Hundreds of people have been kidnapped in and around Chechnya
after the 1994-96 independence war with Russia, and dozens remain
in captivity, including President Boris Yeltsin's envoy to the
region, Valentin Vlasov.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew in the fall of 1996, but Moscow still considers it a part
of Russia and no country has recognized its independence.

Confrontation continues at main Buddhist temple
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ Hundreds of shaven-headed monks
occupied a major temple in central Seoul for a second day Thursday
in a leadership dispute in South Korea's largest Buddhist
denomination.
	   A brief brawling and shoving match erupted between rival monks
at the temple, headquarters of the Chogye Buddhist Order, when
mainstream monks tried to establish ballot booths to elect the
denomination's new head.
	   A faction opposing the current head monk, Song Wol-ju, took
control, pushed his supporters out of the temple and declared a
postponement in the election.
	   Song is seeking a third four-year term. But opponents, including
the order's spiritual leader, Wol Ha, 83, are urging him to step
down. They accuse Song of incompetence and corruption.
	   Song's supporters called the attack a ``coup'' by conservative
monks who opposed his efforts to reform the 1,000-year-old
denomination.
	   For years, Chogye has been plagued by internal conflicts.
	   The simmering conflicts erupted again ahead of Thursday's
scheduled election to choose the next head of Chogye's General
Secretariat, a powerful post in charge of naming chief monks at the
denomination's 1,700 temples across the country.
	   On Wednesday, rival monks threw furniture and garbage in an
hours-long tussle to occupy the five-story, pagoda-shaped
headquarters building.
	   Song's opponents ripped off steel-framed windows and crawled up
the building on ladders. Song's supporters sprayed fire
extinguishers and water from hoses, but were outnumbered and
ousted. They regrouped later to try to regain control.
	   Hundreds of riot police remained on guard but did not intervene.
	   Chogye, which emphasizes the practice of zen meditation, claims
8 million worshipers. South Korea has a population of 44 million.

India, Pakistan discuss terrorism and drug trade across border
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India _ Indian and Pakistani officials discussed
cooperation Thursday in fighting terrorism and drug trafficking
despite mutual accusations of fueling sabotage against each other.
	   On the eve of the meeting, the Indian minister in charge of
internal security, Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani, accused
neighboring Pakistan of being ``a terrorist state'' for its support
of Muslim insurgents in the disputed territory of Kashmir.
	   The meeting was one of a series of six conferences over 10 days
on some of the lesser issues aggravating tension between the
neighbors who have fought three wars since becoming independent of
Britain in 1947 _ two of them over Kashmir.
	   Pakistan has accused India of fomenting ethnic violence,
particularly in its southern province of Sindh. Each denies active
involvement in the other's troubles.
	   At a meeting in a palace-turned-guest house in New Delhi,
India's senior Home Ministry bureaucrat again accused Pakistan of
sponsoring cross-border terrorism, Press Trust of India reported.
	   Since 1989, the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir has been the scene
of a rebellion by disparate Muslim guerrilla outfits, claiming
either to seek an independent Kashmir or to merge with Pakistan,
which is officially an Islamic state. India is predominantly Hindu,
but Muslims are the majority in Kashmir.
	   ``So far as we are concerned, we regard Pakistan as a terrorist
state,'' Advani told reporters in the northern city of Lucknow on
Wednesday. He has said in the past that Pakistan is waging a
``proxy war'' along the Himalayan border.
	   Advani said he was drafting a ``white paper'' with alleged
details of the involvement of Pakistan's Inter Service Intelligence
agency with various terrorist groups in India.
	   None of the talks so far has shown progress. Pakistan says all
issues must await a solution to the dispute over Kashmir, which it
calls the heart of the problem. India believes settling the minor
disputes would create a better atmosphere for the talks on Kashmir.
	   The round of talks conclude Friday with a meeting on cultural
exchanges. Previous discussions were on water sharing in Kashmir,
maritime boundaries, trade and a military confrontation on the
Siachen Glacier in the Himalayas.

Defying ban, more dissidents set up opposition groups
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Despite a government ban, dissidents across China
are preparing to found an opposition party challenging Communist
Party rule, a human rights group said Thursday.
	   Dissidents in 11 provinces have set up ``preparatory
committees'' to lay the groundwork for the China Democracy Party,
the Information Center of Human Rights and Democratic Movement in
China reported.
	   Earlier this week, dissidents in Beijing and nearby Tianjin
announced they had formed a branch of the party, defying warnings
that the group is illegal.
	   Since then, police have stepped up surveillance of leading
activist Xu Wenli, who was named chairman of the Beijing-Tianjin
group, and detained several organizers of the would-be party, Xu
said.
	   Earlier efforts to legally register branches of the party in
recent weeks were quashed by the authorities, and many dissidents
affiliated with the group were detained and interrogated.
	   All organizations are required to register with the government,
which in most cases rejects such applications. Although China has a
number of minor political parties, all are required to support
Communist rule.
	   In reaction to the latest activity, police in several provinces
had briefly detained dissidents or forced them to return to their
homes, the Information Center said.
	   It said that police detained artist Yan Zhengxue for 24 hours
when he attempted to meet with Xu. Xu said his assistant, Zhang
Hui, was forced to return to his home.
	   ``It's good. They sent him home in their car and now he can have
a few days' vacation,'' Xu said.
	   Fellow dissident Lu Honglai, a vice chairman of the
Beijing-Tianjin group, was detained in Tianjin and remained in
custody as of Thursday, although he had been allowed to contact his
family, Xu said.
	   ``They want to talk with him some more and maybe feed him a few
more meals and then maybe he'll be able to go home.''

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Shares in Hong Kong closed lower Thursday,
giving back some of their big gains from Wednesday's session as a
sharp fall on the big Tokyo market dampened investor sentiment.
	   The blue-chip Hang Seng Index fell 189.14 points, or 1.9
percent, closing at 9,948.18. The Hang Seng had surged 415.99
points Wednesday.
	   Turnover came to 6.83 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 875.6
million), compared with 7.82 billion Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs
1.00 billion) in the previous session.
	   Traders said the market dropped on perceptions they had overdone
Wednesday's buying spree.
	   Investors were also discouraged to see so much red ink on the
Tokyo Stock Exchange, Asia's biggest, where the key Nikkei index
fell almost 2.5 percent Thursday amid disappointment about Japan's
economic stimulus package.
	   Among Hong Kong property companies, Cheung Kong Holdings fell
1.00 Hong Kong dollar to 55.50 while rival Sun Hung Kai Properties
lost 1.75 dollars to 50.25.
	   In the banking sector, HSBC Holdings closed down 2.50 dollars at
179.00. Its affiliate Hang Seng Bank lost 1.75 dollars to 63.75.
	   Hong Kong's flagship air carrier, Cathay Pacific, lost 15 Hong
Kong cents to 7.55.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A day after ratifying the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinians, Israel announced Thursday it would
begin construction of a large Jewish neighborhood in a sector of
Jerusalem claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital.
	   Palestinian spokesman Ahmed Tibi denounced the action as a
violation of the peace accords that would ``bring a serious
response'' and demanded U.S. intervention.
	   U.S. Mideast envoy Dennis Ross, who is returning to the region
to supervise implementation of the peace agreement, is to meet
Friday with Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision to give the
go-ahead for construction of the Har Homa neighborhood in
traditionally Arab east Jerusalem came after months of delay. It
was seen as an attempt to blunt the criticism by hard-line Cabinet
ministers, coalition allies and key constituents.
	   The Wye accord was approved Wednesday by only eight of 17
Cabinet ministers, with four opposed. Five ministers, all members
of Netanyahu's Likud Party, abstained.
	   As the Cabinet voted Wednesday evening, thousands of Jewish
settlers staged a protest rally in Tel Aviv, and leading Likud
legislators said the time had come to topple Netanyahu.
	   Later this month, parliament is to vote on a bill to call early
elections, and several hard-line members of Netanyahu's coalition
are expected to back the legislation.
	   In bringing the accord to the ministers, Netanyahu attached
several conditions that set the stage for new crises. He also
threatened to annex parts of the West Bank if the Palestinians
declare independence unilaterally in May.
	   Under the peace deal, Israel is to begin a phased withdrawal
from 13 percent of the West Bank on Monday in return for
Palestinian security measures against Islamic militants. The
withdrawal is to be completed by the end of January.
	   Netanyahu promised the ministers the Cabinet will meet before
each stage of the pullback to vote on whether the Palestinians were
meeting Israel's security demands. If not, ministers would have the
option to halt the process by voting against the next phase.
	   Netanyahu said the agreement would stop altogether if the
Palestine National Council, the Palestinian parliament-in-exile,
does not vote by mid-December to revoke clauses in the PLO founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Under the agreement, the PNC is to convene to reaffirm changes
it voted on in April 1996 and does not mention a vote.
	   Any additional pullback would turn over no more than 1 percent
of the West Bank to Arafat's control.
	   Wednesday's vote had been delayed several times, in part due to
a suicide bombing in Jerusalem by an Islamic militant last week.
Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan said the first pullback would
likely not begin for at least another week, following a
parliamentary vote scheduled Tuesday.
	   Approval in the Knesset is necessary for Israel to begin the
withdrawal. With the conditions set by the Cabinet, the fragile
deal will likely face more obstacles before it is carried out.

Prince returns to Cambodia for summit on forming government

	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Opposition leader Prince Norodom
Ranariddh returned to Cambodia Thursday, optimistic that a summit
hastily called by the king can break rival parties' deadlock over
forming a new government.
	   ``I think definitely we will be part of the national coalition
government. Definitely. Yes,'' Ranariddh told reporters as he left
Bangkok, Thailand, where he had holed up over fears for his
security if he remained in Cambodia.
	   In Phnom Penh, Ranariddh was greeted by U.S., U.N., Japanese,
Canadian and palace officials. He was quickly whisked from the
airport by the bodyguards of his father, King Norodom Sihanouk.
	   Ranariddh, head of the royalist FUNCINPEC party, was to meet his
rivals, led by strongman Hun Sen, for an evening summit under
Sihanouk's direction.
	   The summit, to be held at the Royal Palace to allay Ranariddh's
concerns for his security, could mark an important step toward
breaking the political impasse Cambodia has suffered since
parliamentary elections in July.
	   Ranariddh and his opposition ally, former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy, have rejected the narrow victory by Hun Sen's Cambodian
People's Party and left the country without a legal government.
Badly needed foreign aid has been delayed.
	   Chea Sim, the CPP's president and speaker of the National
Assembly, was expected to join in Thursday's meeting. The assembly
presidency is a key dispute blocking agreement on a coalition
government.
	   The summit was hastily convened after Ranariddh and Chea Sim
asked Sihanouk in writing to organize it. Sihanouk indicated that
the talks would continue through Friday and that the prince would
stay at the palace.
	   The king, 76, had turned up pressure on both sides to start a
new round of negotiations by announcing plans to leave Cambodia for
China Saturday for medical treatment. Sihanouk is the only
Cambodian leader capable of brokering a deal.
	   Previous talks have broken down in acrimony rooted in Hun Sen's
ouster of Ranariddh as co-prime minister in a bloody coup in July
1997.
	   ``I'm not a fortune-teller,'' said U.S. Ambassador Kenneth
Quinn, ``but all I know is, if nobody's talking, there won't be a
government formed. If they are talking, there's a chance.''
	   In the elections, the CPP failed to win the two-thirds
parliamentary majority that would have enabled it to form a
government alone. Ranariddh and Sam Rainsy, the junior opposition
leader, alleged electoral fraud and intimidation and withheld their
support.
	   Both opposition leaders and many of their supporters fled the
country after the new National Assembly was formally sworn in Sept.
24, saying they feared arrest. They dismissed Hun Sen's guarantees
that they would be safe to return.
	   Sihanouk tried to break the impasse last week, offering the
opposition use of his palace for security and saying royal guards
could escort the leaders to and from the airport.
	   On Wednesday, Hun Sen addressed opposition fears of arrest on
trumped-up charges by saying that members of parliament enjoy full
immunity. He predicted a summit would enjoy success under the
king's ``clear-sighted guidance.''
	   There was no immediate comment on the summit from Sam Rainsy,
who is in Europe, but his 15 seats are not vital to building a
two-thirds majority in the 122-member assembly.

Turkish government at brink of collapse

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The minority government was on the brink
of collapse Thursday after a key party defected to the opposition
camp over a privatization scandal.
	   Deniz Baykal, leader of the Republican People's Party, was to
file a no-confidence motion Thursday against Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz. Two other opposition parties lodged no-confidence motions a
day earlier, accusing Yilmaz of abuse of powers and ties to
organized crime. The no-confidence motions were not expected to be
debated before next week.
	   A businessman linked to the mafia claimed Yilmaz interfered in
the privatization of a state-run bank by pledging him loans that
would ensure that his was the highest bid.
	   Also Thursday, police detained Melih Gokcek, the Islamic mayor
of the capital Ankara, on charges of favoring some private firms in
municipality contracts, police chief Cevdet Saral told private NTV
television.
	   His detention is another setback to Turkey's Islamic movement
and follows the conviction of Istanbul's Islamic Mayor Recep Tayyip
Erdogan for reading a stridently anti-secular poem.

Italian and German publisher to sell books over internet
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ Italy's largest book publisher, Arnoldo
Mondadori, and Germany's Bertelsmann will soon start selling books
over the Internet.
	   The two companies announced the launch of the new venture, to be
called Mondo Libri, on Wednesday. As part of the agreement, the
companies said they would merge their Italian book clubs, which
have approximately 2 million members.
	   The publishers said a new equally-owned company will be formed
for the venture.
	   Mondadori will split off its wholly-owned Club Degli Editori
unit, a leader in Italian correspondence sales for publishing
products, into the new venture.
	   Bertelsmann, Europe's largest English-language book publisher,
will place its Euroclub SpA unit into the venture.
	   Mondadori is controlled by Fininvest, the holding company of
media magnate and opposition leader Silvio Berlusconi.

Carlos, on hunger strike, wishes luck to bin Laden
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The man known as Carlos the Jackal, who has refused
food and water for the past week, said in a newspaper interview
published Thursday he has ``no regrets'' and wishes good luck to
Osama bin Laden.
	   ``Our paths have been different but we have the same enemy and I
wish him (bin Laden) the greatest success possible in his fight,''
the Venezuelan-born Illich Ramirez Sanchez was quoted as saying in
an interview with the newspaper France Soir, conducted earlier this
week in his Paris prison cell.
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire, has been indicted by a U.S.
federal court in the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East
Africa that killed 224 people.
	   Ramirez, 49, who has been on a hunger strike since last Tuesday,
said he is certain he will never leave prison and will die there.
He is serving a life term for the 1975 murders of two French
investigators and a Lebanese.
	   He has been in solitary confinement since French agents snared
him in Khartoum, Sudan, on Aug. 15, 1994, then hauled him to Paris
in a sack. He is also under investigation for as many as four
terrorist attacks in France.
	   Commenting on the current situation in the Middle East, Ramirez
said he considers Saddam Hussein to be the last of the Arabian
knights. ``I would be happy to fight under his orders, as a mere
foot soldier against the United States and Israel,'' Ramirez was
quoted as saying.
	   He also said he held no grudges against Sudan for his arrest
there, but added that was not always protected by the Sudanese.
	   As for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Ramirez said he opposes
his policies, even though they are ``logical.''
	   ``My greatest pride is to have contributed to placing the
Palestinian cause on the highest level,'' Ramirez said.
	   Ramirez's lawyers told The Associated Press last week that they
had co-signed his will, and that he is preparing mentally for
death.
	   A prison medical exam found that he has lost more than 17 pounds
and now weighs 181 pounds, the lawyers said.
	   Over a week without food and water was taking its toll, they
said, on the man long portrayed as a fearless, swaggering terrorist
linked to the 1975 seizure of OPEC ministers in Vienna, Austria,
and the 1976 hijacking of an Air France jet to Uganda.

U.S. official: Chinese missile technology may have gone abroad
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHARLES HUTZLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ Washington suspects China may have transferred
missile technology to Iran and Pakistan despite Chinese pledges to
strengthen missile export controls, a U.S. official said Thursday.
	   U.S. concerns about possible transfers were aired during a day
and a half of meetings between senior Chinese and American
arms-control negotiators, the official said, speaking on condition
of anonymity.
	   Undersecretary of State John Holum, who led the U.S. team, said
he and Chinese Foreign Minister Tang Jiaxuan and senior military
commander Gen. Zhang Wannian also discussed North Korea's
threatening launch of a rocket over Japan in late August.
	   Suspicions of Chinese nuclear and missile proliferation have
been a constant irritant in U.S.-China relations. The potential
dangers crystallized this spring with South Asia's nuclear arms
race. Within two months, Pakistan, China's staunch ally, tested a
ballistic missile and exploded a nuclear bomb.
	   Despite questions about China's involvement, Chinese leaders
have grown increasingly aware of the dangers proliferation poses to
the stable world order they need to meet their primary objective:
economic growth.
	   Much of Holum's discussions centered on Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's pledge to U.S. President Bill Clinton at their June summit
to consider joining a treaty controlling exports of missiles and
the technology used to make them.
	   Holum met with his counterpart, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang
Deguang, for the first time since the summit. The U.S. team
answered Chinese questions about joining the 32-nation Missile
Technology Control Regime and how it operates.
	   ``We are working with them on a road map and a set of steps to
take to'' secure their signing, Holum said.
	   Secret transfers of Chinese missile components and technology to
Pakistan provoked Clinton to punish China in 1993 by banning
exports of certain advanced technology. The ban was lifted in 1994
after China agreed to abide by the regime's major tenet, the
prohibition of the sale of surface-to-surface missiles.
	   While China has lived up to that commitment, it is unclear
whether it is passing on technology that aids in development of
missile systems, said the U.S. official.
	   ``We have concerns about possible technology transfers from
Chinese entities to Iran and Pakistan,'' said the U.S. official.
``We continue to discuss those with China and believe they are
taking steps to address those problems.''
	   The official refused to provide details on what types of
technology may have been transferred and when. He said there was
insufficient evidence to confirm Chinese violations and then bring
sanctions.
	   He would not comment on whether China may have assisted the
missile program of North Korea, once a close ally, but he noted
that the Chinese government has been a constructive partner in
peace talks with the United States, South Korea and North Korea.
	   Washington also determined that Pakistan received North Korean,
not Chinese, help in developing the Ghauri missile launched in
April, he said.
	   Getting China to sign the missile treaty would help control the
flow of missile-related technology because the accord's annex
spells out prohibited transfers, the official said.

No panic in Baghdad as government sends assuring messages

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's state-run newspapers were full of
messages of support for Saddam Hussein in the latest crisis with
the United Nations _ and they did not mention the surprise
evacuation of U.N. workers for 12 hours.
	   Many Iraqis say they do not fear a new U.S. military strike,
adding they could do little about it anyway. Streets were full
Thursday and there was no signs of people rushing to stock up on
food.
	   Hussein Ali Kadhim, a vendor in Baghdad's commercial hub of
Shorja, said Wednesday he believed most Iraqis were fed up with
crises over U.N. arms inspectors and hoped a flare-up of
hostilities would lead to some change.
	   ``How many times will America come and unleash its missiles and
go as if nothing happened. It must be a game and we, the ordinary
people, do not understand,'' said Kadhim.
	   Unlike in past crises, the Iraqi dinar did not dive in value,
staying steady at 1,750 to the dollar. Grocers also said prices
were stable despite possible U.S. missile strikes.
	   ``I have not seen anything extraordinary today. It is like any
other day,'' said grocer Nizar Khalifa.
	   That calm may be because the government is sending a different
message this time compared to past confrontations with the United
Nations.
	   It has not announced any measures to ward off a possible
military strike, nor has it rationed gasoline _ which usually set
off runs on filling stations.
	   While reports outside Iraq spoke of war preparations _ the
London-based Al-Zaman newspaper said key military and security
headquarters were evacuated _ none of this was apparent in Baghdad.
	   In the past, the government publicized that it was dismantling
factories to protect them against attack and sent units of military
police into the streets.
	   Not this time.
	   Instead there were the messages of support for Saddam in
Wednesday's newspapers from tribal leaders and trade unions.
	   And although weapons inspectors started pulling out Wednesday
morning _ giving a possible U.S. attack as the reason _ Iraqi radio
and TV did not broadcast the news until mid-evening _ long after
people had done their shopping for the day.
	   Despite a heavy downpour that turned the streets of Baghdad into
swamps, all was normal.
	   Shops remained opened into the evening. Rasheed Avenue,
Baghdad's main thoroughfare, was congested with cars, and
pedestrians strolling along the colonnaded sidewalk.
	   Residents in Shorja were not aware the inspectors were pulled
out. Nizar Abdul-Khalifa said the United Nations withdrew all its
inspectors in 1997 as well, after Iraq blocked American inspectors
from working.
	   ``We have passed through this before,'' he said. ``Personally I
am not afraid at all.''

Report: Israel says suspects in Cyprus were Mossad agents
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last
week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence
agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
	   Israel's government has not acknowledged that the two are
Israeli agents. Earlier this week, the Israeli Foreign Ministry
would only say that rumors that the two were spying on behalf of
Turkey, Israel's military ally, were not true. Turkey has occupied
the northern third of Cyprus since an invasion in 1974.
	   The statement also said the two men were not acting against
Cyprus.
	   Cypriot police arrested the Israelis in the coastal fishing town
of Ziyi on Saturday and accused them of spying on a nearby army
base.
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that the two men were part of an
Israeli intelligence operation held near Ziyi last Friday and
Saturday. The newspaper said it learned from a senior source in
Cyprus that the two men had been guarding a meeting of Mossad
agents. They were listening to police scanners to make sure no one
approached the meeting place, the newspaper said.
	   The Mossad told the authorities in Cyprus that it was not
interested in damaging Nicosia's sovereignty and that it was simply
going about its business.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus for three
days last week, sent an envoy to the island on Sunday in efforts to
ease tensions over the case.
	   The source in Cyprus said comments by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this week that ``of course we'll bring
them home'' had damaged chances the two would be quickly released.

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A second batch of U.N. relief workers left
Iraq by bus on Thursday, and the ruling party's newspaper condemned
the increasing possibility of U.S. air strikes as American
``psychological warfare.''
	   U.N. humanitarian program spokesman Eric Falt said 25 workers
left instead of the 40 that officials had initially decided would
go. He did not elaborate. In addition, all 103 United Nations
weapons inspectors went to Bahrain by air on Wednesday.
	   About 295 humanitarian workers are now left in Iraq, mostly in
the Kurdish north that is unlikely to be targeted. Before Wednesday
the U.N. had 450 relief program staffers in Iraq.
	   Falt said all the 155 relief workers evacuated so far _ 130 left
Wednesday for Jordan's capital, Amman _ were based in the southern
and central Iraq.
	   Despite mounting military threats, Iraq showed no sign of
backing down from its refusal to allow the resumption of arms
inspections. Newspapers published a statement by the ruling Baath
party urging Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at
American interests in case of U.S. aggression.
	   In a front page editorial, the Baath party newspaper, al-Thawra,
said the U.S. military preparations in the Gulf were part of
American ``psychological warfare.''
	   ``Iraq no longer pays attention to these empty threats,'' it
said and asserted that Iraq will not back down.
	   The official al-Qadissiya newspaper said President Saddam
Hussein's Cabinet discussed the crisis Wednesday. Iraq's five
official dailies published pictures of Saddam meeting ministers and
senior military commanders to discuss a response to the ``American
and Zionist aggression.''
	   Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride, and there
was little evidence of panic or people rushing to stock up on food.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
response since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning
a major buildup of warplanes and troops, President Bill Clinton
warned that spurning U.N. demands for arms inspections would be a
costly mistake for Iraq.
	   The U.N. Security Council has backed Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's call to Saddam for immediately resuming cooperation with
the weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq says it will not do so unless the council moves to begin
lifting trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   But the council is bound by a resolution that will not allow the
lifting of sanctions until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
dismantled its nuclear program, biological and chemical weapons and
long range missiles.
	   The sanctions have contributed to Iraq's economic devastation.
Recognizing the plight of the Iraqis, the United Nations has
allowed Iraq to sell limited quantities of crude oil to buy food
and medicine for its 22 million people since December 1996.
	   However, the distribution of the food and aid is monitored by
the U.N. humanitarian program, which is also responsible for
distributing the aid in the northern Kurdish areas on behalf of the
Iraqi government.
	   The United Nations said in New York that Thursday's evacuation
would leave about 55 U.N. staff members in Baghdad and more than
230 in the north.
	   Those who stayed behind quickly hung mesh screens over the glass
windows of the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad _
likely a precaution against flying glass in the event of a military
strike.
	   Among the U.N. people remaining are Prakash Shah, Annan's envoy
to Iraq, and Hans von Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian
operations who took up his post in Iraq on Monday.
	   Von Sponeck said the evacuation would slow down but not end the
distribution of relief supplies in government-controlled areas.
	   ``Our capacity is much reduced,'' von Sponeck said. ``But
whatever capacity we have we will utilize for our humanitarian
program.''
	   The pullout is likely to halt the work of other specialized U.N.
agencies.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz had sent a letter to Annan complaining about
the withdrawal of the weapons inspectors, saying that UNSCOM was
following U.S. orders and using the United Nations as ``false
cover.''

Neumann well poised after opening round
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Sweden's Liselotte Neumann missed a
chance to share the lead but remained well-placed after the opening
round of the Australian dlrs 350,000 (U.S. dlrs 222,250) women's
Australian Open Thursday.
	   Neumann had a bogey six at the 18th hole to slip a shot behind
leaders Marnie McGuire of New Zealand and Siew-Ai Lim of Malaysia
who both had 1-under par 72.
	   The Yarra Yarra course was soaked by heavy rain and that took
its toll on top local hope Karrie Webb. Webb, who played with
Neumann, shot a 78 and admitted she had little left in her at the
end of a tough season. The final LPGA tournament is in Las Vegas
next week.
	   Lim, who has a psychology degree from Oklahoma State University,
has won entry into next year's LPGA Tour after a difficult year
scratching around on the Futures Tour.
	   She said she had been forced to live in her car or stay with
contacts as she compiled U.S. dlrs 16,000.
	   ``You could say I'm homeless in the U.S.,'' Lim said. ``I go
from week to week staying at different homes.''
	   She started playing golf as a six-year-old under the tutelage of
Sydney pro Bill McWilliam at the Royal Selangor Club in Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Webb, who won her first event at home in this year's Australian
Masters in February, said she could have played a lot better but
for the lousy conditions.
	   ``The wind and the rain are two factors that make it very
tough,'' Webb said. ``I've got to the stage where, it's getting
towards the end of the year and when a day like this happens it's
hard enough work just playing well.''
	   Christie Kerr of the United States was in touch with the leaders
after a 74 while compatriot Kelly Robbins had a 75.

U.N. stages second evacuation of relief workers from Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A second batch of United Nations relief
workers left Iraq by bus on Thursday, and the ruling party's
newspaper condemned the increasing possibility of U.S. air strikes
as American ``psychological warfare.''
	   U.N. humanitarian program spokesman Eric Falt said 25 workers
left instead of the 40 that officials initially decided would go.
He did not elaborate. In addition, all 103 United Nations weapons
inspectors went to Bahrain by air on Wednesday.
	   About 295 humanitarian workers are now left in Iraq, mostly in
the Kurdish north that is unlikely to be targeted. Before
Wednesday, the United Nations had 450 relief program staffers in
Iraq.
	   Falt said all the 155 relief workers evacuated so far _ 130 left
Wednesday for Jordan's capital, Amman _ were based in the southern
and central Iraq.
	   Despite mounting military threats, Iraq showed no sign of
backing down from its refusal to allow the resumption of arms
inspections. Newspapers published a statement by the ruling Baath
party urging Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at
American interests in case of U.S. aggression.
	   In a front page editorial, the Baath party newspaper, al-Thawra,
said the U.S. military preparations in the Gulf were part of
American ``psychological warfare.''
	   ``Iraq no longer pays attention to these empty threats,'' it
said and asserted that Iraq will not back down.
	   The official al-Qadissiya newspaper said President Saddam
Hussein's Cabinet discussed the crisis Wednesday. Iraq's five
official dailies published pictures of Saddam meeting ministers and
senior military commanders to discuss a response to the ``American
and Zionist aggression.''
	   Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride, and there
was little evidence of panic or people rushing to stock up on food.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
response since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning
a major buildup of warplanes and troops, President Bill Clinton
warned that spurning U.N. demands for arms inspections would be a
costly mistake for Iraq.
	   The U.N. Security Council has backed Secretary-General Kofi
Annan's call to Saddam for immediately resuming cooperation with
the weapons inspectors.
	   Iraq says it will not do so unless the council moves to begin
lifting trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   But the council is bound by a resolution that will not allow the
lifting of sanctions until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
dismantled its nuclear program, biological and chemical weapons and
long range missiles.
	   The sanctions have contributed to Iraq's economic devastation.
Recognizing the plight of the Iraqis, the United Nations has
allowed Iraq to sell limited quantities of crude oil to buy food
and medicine for its 22 million people since December 1996.
	   However, the distribution of the food and aid is monitored by
the U.N. humanitarian program, which is also responsible for
distributing the aid in the northern Kurdish areas on behalf of the
Iraqi government.
	   The United Nations said in New York that Thursday's evacuation
would leave about 55 U.N. staff members in Baghdad and more than
230 in the north.
	   Those who stayed behind quickly hung mesh screens over the glass
windows of the U.N. headquarters on the outskirts of Baghdad _
likely a precaution against flying glass in the event of a military
strike.
	   Among the U.N. people remaining are Prakash Shah, Annan's envoy
to Iraq, and Hans von Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian
operations who took up his post in Iraq on Monday.
	   Von Sponeck said the evacuation would slow down but not end the
distribution of relief supplies in government-controlled areas.
	   ``Our capacity is much reduced,'' von Sponeck said. ``But
whatever capacity we have we will utilize for our humanitarian
program.''
	   The pullout is likely to halt the work of other specialized U.N.
agencies.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz sent a letter to Annan complaining about the
withdrawal of the weapons inspectors, saying that UNSCOM was
following U.S. orders and using the United Nations as ``false
cover.''

Musashimaru remains undefeated at 5-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FUKUOKA, Japan (AP) _ Hawaiian-born ozeki (champion) Musashimaru
remained undefeated Thursday and shared the lead at 5-0 with
lower-ranked wrestlers Kaio and Kotonishiki in the 15-day Kyushu
Grand Sumo Tournament.
	   One victory behind at 4-1 were six wrestlers, including yokozuna
(grand champion) Wakanohana, sekiwake (junior champion) Chiyotaikai
and komusubi (junior champion) Musoyama.
	   Yokozuna Takanohana and ozeki (champion) Takanonami followed at
3-2 with eight lower-ranked wrestlers.
	   Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitani, grabbed winless No. 3
maegashira (senior wrestler) Tochinowaka's belt and easily drove
him out.
	   Musashimaru, who has won three tournaments, next meets No. 1
maegashira Kaio, who also is undefeated. Kaio, who beat two
yokozunas and ozeki Takanonami on the tournament's first three
days, toppled No. 6 maegashira Wakanosato (3-2) with an arm throw
in the initial charge Thursday.
	   Takanohana, seeking his 21st tournament title and third in a
row, bulldozed winless No. 2 maegashira Higonoumi to the ring's
edge and crushed him down.
	   Wakanohana pushed down winless No. 2 maegashira Kaiho after
fighting off Kaiho's hand thrusts.
	   Takanonami lifted No. 3 maegashira Ganyu (1-4) to the ring's
edge and sent him out.
	   Musoyama pushed out No. 4 maegashira Tamakasuga, leaving both
wrestlers at 4-1.
	   Chiyotaikai suffered his first defeat when komusubi Kotonowaka
(3-2) held off his fierce hand thrusts, maneuvered behind him and
sent him out from behind.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kotonishiki dodged No. 9 maegashira
Tosanoumi's initial charge, grabbed his belt and sent him out.
Tosanoumi is 4-1.
	   No. 12 maegashira Kyokushuzan, or Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, was
forced out by No. 14 maegashira Mitoizumi, leaving both at 2-3.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
division, No. 2-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
was driven out by No. 6-ranked Wakahayato (3-2) for his third
defeat against two victories.
	   No. 10-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
slapped down No. 6-ranked Daizen (2-3) for his third victory
against two defeats.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 15-ranked
Ryuko, or Brazilian Luis Go Ikemori, forced out No. 19-ranked
Kyokuhikari and remained undefeated at 3-0.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions have only seven bouts during the
tournament.

Turkish government at brink of collapse

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Republican party submitting no-confidence motion,
ADDS details, fresh material, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ The minority government was on the brink
of collapse Thursday after a key party defected to the opposition
camp over a privatization scandal.
	   The leader of the pivotal Republican People's Party, Deniz
Baykal, filed a no-confidence motion Thursday against Prime
Minister Mesut Yilmaz, siding with two opposition parties which
lodged no-confidence motions a day earlier.
	   The motions accused Yilmaz of abuse of powers and ties to
organized crime. They were not expected to be debated before next
week.
	   Yilmaz came under pressure Wednesday to resign after a
businessman linked to the mafia claimed the premier rigged the
privatization of a state-run bank by pledging him loans that would
ensure that his was the highest bid.
	   Yilmaz said he wanted to keep the mafia out of the deal and was
trying to get the highest price possible from the sale. He has
repeatedly said he would not resign. However, with no hope of
surviving opposition moves to bring him down, it was unclear he
would change his mind and quit.
	   English language Turkish Daily News paper said Thursday that
Yilmaz would resign just before the legislature votes on the
motions. The opposition appears to have the absolute majority of
votes required to topple Yilmaz.
	   ``I am a minority government, I cannot resist. If Baykal
withdraws support that is the end of the government,'' Yilmaz said
early Thursday speaking on private Kanal D television.
	   The turmoil already affected the functioning of the Parliament
with opposition deputies not attending scheduled meetings, private
NTV television said.
	   A small coalition partner, Democratic Turkey Party, was to
announce its decision Thursday on whether to withdraw from the
government.
	   Daily Sabah suggested President Suleyman Demirel would appoint
an interim government of non-partisan figures.
	   Yilmaz came to power in July 1997 after the military pressured
an Islamic-led government out of office for its anti-secular
policies. With the backing of the Republicans, Yilmaz has since
then been campaigning against radical Islam and organized crime, at
the urging of the military.
	   Also Thursday, police detained Melih Gokcek, the Islamic mayor
of the capital Ankara, on charges of favoring some private firms in
municipality contracts, police chief Cevdet Saral told private NTV
television.
	   His detention is another setback to Turkey's Islamic movement
and follows the conviction of Istanbul's Islamic Mayor Recep Tayyip
Erdogan for reading a stridently anti-secular poem. It was also
unclear who would be appointed to replace Yilmaz's government until
elections scheduled for April.
	   Turkey has witnessed the collapse of three governments since the
last elections held in 1995.

Russia won't bail out commercial banks if assets are frozen abroad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia won't bail out domestic banks whose assets
are frozen by foreign creditors, the head of the Central Bank said
Thursday, matching the tough stance taken earlier by Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said the Central Bank
can't do anything to help Russian commercial banks whose assets are
frozen overseas, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   A government-declared moratorium on debt payments that had
protected Russian banks is due to expire within days.
	   On Wednesday, striking a similar tone, Primakov said the
government will not guarantee private deposits in commercial banks.
	   ``We live in a market economy,'' he said, according to Interfax.
``If Russians want guarantees, they should put their money in
Sberbank,'' the national savings bank.
	   Gerashchenko's remarks were aimed specifically at Russian banks
that don't fulfill currency forward contracts with foreign banks.
Under terms of those contracts, the Russian banks agreed to buy
rubles from Western banks for dollars at a previously agreed-upon
exchange rate _ a deal they now cannot possibly meet.
	   The bank chairman said he expects the foreign banks to begin
freezing the assets of the Russian banks after expiration of the
moratorium.
	   Russian banks' liabilities on such contracts are estimated at
dlrs 7 billion.
	   ``The central bank can't take on itself fulfillment of
obligations for forward contracts,'' Gerashchenko said. He noted
that the Central Bank can only give recommendations for the
conditions under which the commercial banks' debts should be
restructured.
	   Last Friday, Russia and its western creditors reached a
tentative agreement to restructure some dlrs 10 billion of Russian
Treasury debt. Under the terms of the deal, both sides agreed to
resolve the forward contract issue separately.
	   In another economic development, Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail
Kasyanov said in a newspaper interview that Russia will try to
reschedule its payments on the debt of the former Soviet Union.
	   ``it is clear that Russia will ask the creditors of the former
USSR to give (the Russian government) the possibility of further
breathing space on the payments of the debt in the next year or
two,'' Kasyanov said in an interview with the business daily
Kommersant.

Reputed Hong Kong mob boss gets death in China

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong mob boss was sentenced to
death Thursday in China after he was convicted of kidnapping and
arms smuggling in a case that highlighted differences in the two
legal systems.
	   Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' learned his fate in a
Guangzhou courthouse ringed by sharpshooters and security personnel
wearing bulletproof vests and carrying machine guns.
	   The case has riveted attention in Hong Kong, where two top
tycoons were reportedly kidnapped and paid hundreds of millions of
U.S. dollars in ransom to Cheung's gang.
	   Legal experts also raised questions about the jurisdiction,
noting that some crimes committed in Hong Kong, which does not
execute people, were prosecuted in China as capital offenses in a
trial closed to journalists.
	   The verdicts and sentences were explained by Chinese legal
officials in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160 kilometers) north of the
Hong Kong border, in a news conference carried by Hong Kong
television stations.
	   Cheung's underlings were found guilty in a string of spectacular
crimes, including the smuggling of dynamite and guns from China
into Hong Kong, seven armed robberies at Hong Kong gold stores that
netted 7.4 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 950,000) and the
theft of 277 tons of steel in Shenzhen, China, the official Chinese
news agency, Xinhua, reported.
	   One man, identified only by the surname Li, was killed in the
steel heist, Xinhua said.
	   Four of Cheung's accomplices, Chan Chi-ho, Ma Shangzhong, Liang
Hui and Chin Hon-sau, also were sentenced to death by the
Intermediate People's Court of Guangzhou, Xinhua said.
	   Two others, Chu Yuk-sing and Li Wan, received death sentences
that the court suspended for two years, giving them time to
demonstrate good behavior and perhaps have their punishments
reduced to prison terms, Xinhua said.
	   Twenty-nine other members of Cheung's gang were sentenced to
prison, some for life, Xinhua said, citing a public announcement
from the court.
	   Hong Kong media had reported the case also concerned murders of
a mainland Chinese businessman and a Hong Kong resident. Xinhua
made no mention of murder charges, although it mentioned at least
one death, during the steel theft.
	   Under Chinese law, the gangsters can appeal within 10 days of
receiving a written judgment. Those who got death will have their
cases automatically reviewed by the Higher People's Court of
Guangdong province, Xinhua said. Cheung's case was the first
high-profile cross-border trial since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese
rule from Britain last year.
	   Despite calls from Cheung's lawyers to have the case transferred
to Hong Kong, which has a more open court system modeled after
Britain's, authorities here said they could not take over. The
kidnappings and other crimes were never reported to Hong Kong
police, so Hong Kong prosecutors had no evidence.
	   The Hong Kong Bar Association said Thursday the Chinese courts
had every right to try the gangsters.
	   But Hong Kong's failure to seek the return of any defendants
``may give people the false impression that the judiciary and the
rule of law in Hong Kong are somehow subordinate to that of the
rest of China, and thus indirectly cast a question mark over the
concept `one country, two systems,''' attorney Ronny Tong said on
behalf of the bar.
	   Hong Kong's secretary of security, Regina Ip, sought to play
down those concerns, saying Hong Kong citizens should remain
confident in their justice system.
	   ``There is no question of the mainland interfering with Hong
Kong's own independent adjudicating power,'' Ip told a news
conference.
	   Cheung's gangsters plotted many of their illegal activities in
the mainland and some crimes took place there, Xinhua reported.
Xinhua also noted 18 defendants were mainland residents. All were
arrested in China.
	   The most sensational charges reportedly concerned kidnappings of
two Hong Kong tycoons, identified in Hong Kong newspapers as Victor
Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman
of the big developer Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   Xinhua said there were three kidnap victims. It identified them
only by the surnames Li, Lam and Kwok. Kidnappings in May 1996 and
September 1997 netted Cheung and his gang 1.64 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 210 million) in ransom, Xinhua said.

Report: First direct contact government-ETA
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government and the armed Basque
separatist group ETA have made direct contact for the first time,
an initial step toward peace talks, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The move followed Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's
authorization last week of contacts with ETA, the daily El Mundo
reported, quoting unnamed government sources.
	   Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office contacted by
the Associated Press, refused to comment on the report. He said
that although Aznar has promised to inform the public of all
developments related to the Basque peace process, the delicacy of
the issue requires that the details be treated with discretion.
	   El Mundo said the first direct government-ETA contacts were
limited to a recognition that there would be more contact in the
future.
	   The possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year-long
violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling the
Spanish-French border dates to Sept. 18 when ETA began observing an
indefinite cease-fire.
	   The government gradually softened its position on the truce,
with the initial suspicion developing into the latest promise of
dialogue.
	   Although willing to talk, the government insists that the agenda
will not include political issues such as ETA's stated aim of
Basque independence.
	   ETA--the initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Freedom--has killed nearly 800 people since taking up
arms in 1968.

Lebanese president undergoes successful heart surgery

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Elias Hrawi underwent
successful heart surgery Thursday to clear a blocked artery,
hospital officials said.
	   The president responded positively to the procedure that
involved inserting a catheter into the heart, said a statement
issued by the Sacre Coeur Hospital in suburban Beirut.
	   Agriculture Minister Shawki Fakhoury said Hrawi did not need an
open-heart operation. Another hospital statement on Wednesday had
said Hrawi's life was not in danger.
	   Hrawi, 73, was admitted to hospital Tuesday after a mild heart
attack. He is in intensive care and recovering under the routine
watch of doctors, Thursday's statement said.
	   Hrawi is due to step down as president on Nov. 24 at the end of
an extended nine-year term. His successor is Emile Lahoud.
	   Hrawi appeared on television Tuesday evening awarding a
decoration to a Lebanese bank executive for his community work.
Four days ago, Hrawi traveled to Damascus for a farewell meeting
with Syrian President Hafez Assad.

Government, ETA have made first direct contact, report says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government and the armed Basque
separatist group ETA have made direct contact for the first time,
an initial step toward peace talks, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The move followed Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar's
authorization last week of contacts with ETA, the daily El Mundo
reported, quoting unnamed government sources.
	   The possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year-long
violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling the
Spanish-French border dates to Sept. 18 when ETA began observing an
indefinite cease-fire. The government gradually softened its
position, with the initial suspicion developing into the latest
promise of dialogue.
	   Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office contacted by
The Associated Press, refused to comment on the newspaper report.
Although Aznar has promised to inform the public of all
developments related to the Basque peace process, the delicacy of
the issue requires that the details be treated with discretion, he
said.
	   El Mundo said the first direct government-ETA contacts were
limited to a recognition that there would be more future contact.
	   Although willing to talk, the government insists the agenda will
not include political issues such as ETA's stated aim of Basque
independence.
	   ETA _ the initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Freedom _ has killed nearly 800 people since taking up
arms in 1968.

	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ President Elias Hrawi underwent
successful heart surgery Thursday to clear a blocked artery,

Local court fines largest state-run daily
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A court on Thursday fined Serbia's
largest state-run daily and its chief editor the equivalent of
dlrs. 15,000, the lowest prescribed penalty for breach of a new
restrictive media law, according to a radio report.
	   A lawsuit against Politika newspaper and its chief editor Dragan
Hadzi Antic was initiated earlier in the week by opposition leader
Zoran Djindjic, who accused the daily of publishing ``lies and
slander'' against himself and his Democratic Party.
	   According to a Nov. 4 article published in Politika, Djindjic
was reported to have told a party associate he had ``guarantees
NATO would bomb Serbia'' because of the crackdown against ethnic
Albanian separatists in Kosovo province. He instructed the
associate to ``get the (party's) money out'' to safety abroad
	   Following two days of court hearings, a Belgrade court ruled
Thursday that the state-run daily and its chief editor would have
to pay dlrs. 10,000 and 5,000 for publishing ``unconfirmed
information,'' reported Belgrade's B-92 radio.
	   Last month, Serbia's government adopted a new information law
re-imposing censorship and launched the toughest crackdown yet on
the country's fledgling independent media.
	   The law severely limited press freedoms and instituted sky-high
penalties against those publishing ``anti-patriotic and
antigovernment'' stories.
	   The purge was followed by police raids, property confiscation,
lawsuits against independent papers as well as impounding of entire
copies of fined dailies.
	   Two independent papers halted publishing in protest of the law.
In separate court trials against them, an independent daily and its
sister weekly were fined sums equaling dlrs. 240,000 and 120,000
each for publishing anti-state articles.
	   ``We have no illusions that the court's ruling in our favor and
fining Politika with the minimum penalty is a real victory,'' Goran
Vesic from the Democratic Party press office told The Associated
Press after hearing of the verdict Thursday. ``But it was the first
verdict against the regime ... we now have legally proved that a
regime paper printed lies and libel.''
	   ``All we can do to fight this absurd media law is to swamp
Serbia's government-controlled courts with counter-charges against
state-run media whenever they print lies,'' Vesic said.

American kidnapped in southern Russia

 &UR; EDs: CORRECTS spelling of hostage to `Gregg' sted of `Cregg.'
 &UR; By NABI ABDULAYEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MAKACHKALA, Russia (AP) _ An American teacher and missionary has
been kidnapped near the southern Russian region of Chechnya by
unidentified abductors who made no immediate demands, officials
said Thursday.
	   Herbert Gregg, 51, was abducted on Wednesday night in
Makhachkala, the capital of Dagestan, which borders breakaway
Chechnya.
	   A youth said he saw four attackers forcing Gregg into a car with
tinted windows and driving away. The boy alerted police, who began
a massive search effort, said Akhberdilav Akilov, a local police
official in charge of combating organized crime.
	   Gregg and his wife Linda have been living in Dagestan for the
past four years. Both have been teaching English to university
students, and he has also been involved in charity and missionary
activities.
	   Gregg helped pay for construction of a sports hall at a local
school, and was coaching its basketball team. He was kidnapped
right after attending basketball practice on Wednesday, Akilov
said.
	   Gregg's wife said the pair had received no threats or extortion
demands in the past.
	   Sheikh Ismailov, president of Dagestan's Pedagogical University,
said Gregg and his wife had worked under a contract with a U.S.
foundation called Social and Cultural Progress, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Dagestan has remained restive, plagued by frequent kidnappings,
shootings, bombings and other violent crimes. Many kidnappings have
been linked to militants coming from neighboring Chechnya, which
fought a war with Russia from 194-96.
	   Hundreds of Russians and foreigners have been kidnapped in and
around Chechnya in recent years by gangs seeking ransom, and dozens
remain in captivity.
	   Chechnya has been running its own affairs since Russian troops
withdrew two years ago. No country has recognized Chechnya's
independence, and Moscow insists the territory is still part of
Russia.

Philippine shares mixed after profit-taking, peso strengthens
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippines shares were mixed
Thursday, with last-minute profit-taking trimming initial gains,
traders said.
	   The Philippine Stock Exchange index of 30 selected stocks rose
25.92 points, or 1.5 percent, to 1,734.15 after advancing 71.13
points Wednesday.
	   However, losers led by Philippine Long Distance Telephone Co.
outnumbered gainers 55 to 51. There were 41 issues unchanged.
	   PLDT surged early on reports that Hong Kong's First Pacific Co.
would complete its purchase of a substantial stake in the phone
company Thursday. First Pacific's unit, Metro Pacific, also surged
early.
	   Later reports that some details had delayed the deal sent PLDT
and Metro Pacific shares near their day lows.
	   The broader All Shares Index gained 5.24 points to 557.78 after
rising 19.46 points Wednesday.
	   Property stocks, which soared Wednesday, were sold down as well.
	   Astro del Castillo, analyst for A and A Securities Inc., said
that despite some disappointment over the PLDT deal, the market
remained poised for further gains since the Philippine peso has
continued to appreciate against the U.S. dollar after its recent
weakness.
	   But Erwin Balita, analyst for Securities 2000, said that unless
fresh incentives emerge, the market will likely encounter selling
pressure once it rises near 1,800.
	   The peso closed higher against the U.S. dollar.
	   Market players unloaded their long dollar positions following
rumors that First Pacific's planned buy-in into PLDT had gone
ahead, traders said.
	   But some banks resumed dollar buying when the rumors turned out
to be premature, limiting the peso's gains.
	   The dollar averaged 40.362 pesos Thursday, down from Wednesday's
average of 40.744 pesos. Volume was dlrs 243.10 million, up from
the previous day's dlrs 199.30 million.
	   The dollar traded in a wide range of 40.050 to 40.900 pesos.

Disputed Kuril Islands dominate Russian-Japanese summit
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS with 9 grafs to UPDATE with Yeltsin giving proposal to
Obuchi. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin presented Japan's prime
minister with a plan Thursday to resolve the conflict that has
divided their nations for more than half a century _ the ownership
of the disputed Kuril Islands.
	   Yeltsin warmly greeted Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi at the
Kremlin, and later handed him Russia's long-awaited response to
Japan's proposals to settle the dispute on the Kurils.
	   While there could be progress, reaching a final agreement is
expected to be a long, difficult process.
	   The two leaders were expected to sign previously resolved
agreements on investment protection and cooperation in transport,
tourism and environmental protection.
	   ``It's good that our agreements are being implemented. I think
we should fulfill the program,'' Yeltsin said at the outset of the
meeting, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   But the main task before the leaders was resolution of the
dispute over the Kuril chain, which consists of four islands. The
islands, known to Japanese as the Northern Territories, were once
held by Tokyo but have been controlled by Moscow since the end of
World War II.
	   Both nations claim ownership, and the dispute is the main reason
the two haven't signed a formal peace treaty ending the war.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented new
proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in Japan
in April. The proposals have not been made public. According to
media reports, Tokyo has suggested an arrangement that would
recognize Japanese sovereignty, but would allow Russia to retain
control for some time.
	   Yeltsin has long stalled. Russian officials did not immediately
describe in detail the proposal he handed Obuchi, but Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov vaguely described it as creating conditions
that would allow joint activity by both countries in the Kurils.
	   During their summit in Krasnoyarsk in November 1997, Yeltsin and
Hashimoto pledged to make the utmost effort to sign a peace treaty
by 2000. But Japan wants the treaty to spell out the status of the
Kurils.
	   ``I believe that our generation carries the responsibility for
making sure that the problems that have arisen in this century are
solved before it is over and are not shifted to the shoulders of
our children and grandchildren,'' Obuchi told the Russian daily
newspaper Izvestia in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in contention _
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty
with Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing
days of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since as
illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 Russian inhabitants, but the
waters around them are rich fishing grounds.
	   The summit was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting since his
latest illness sidelined him a month ago. The president's office
said Wednesday that the 67-year-old leader planned to visit Japan
next spring or summer.
	   Japan has announced plans to give an dlrs 800 million loan to
Russia. The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. But the
IMF and the World Bank have put their loans on hold after Russia
succumbed to economic crisis in August.
	   No timetable has been set for the release of the Japanese loan,
but Obuchi's spokesman Sadaaki Numata said it ``would not be a
months-long wait.''

Thousands of students march near Indonesian assembly
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with students breaking through police cordons, ruling
party leaders saying election may be delayed until July, instead of
May &QL;

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Yelling pro-democracy slogans, at
least 15,000 students converged near Parliament Thursday in the
biggest day of protest so far against a government assembly on
political reform.
	   Crowds of marchers chanting ``Let us through'' and waving red
and white Indonesian flags pushed through cordons of riot police
with sticks and shields on a toll road near the legislative hall.
	   Fearing violence, banks, shops and offices closed their doors
and sent workers home early. Streets in the usually
traffic-clogged, tropical capital were clear.
	   There were no reports of clashes, but the mood recalled deadly
riots in May that shook Jakarta and helped oust former President
Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   This week, several protests have ended in violence pitting
students, who accuse the government of stalling Indonesia's
transition to democracy, against riot police and military-backed
civilian guards.
	   In a move likely to further anger students, government leaders
said that 1999 parliamentary elections were likely to be delayed
until July, two months later than President B.J. Habibie had
promised.
	   Marzuki Darusman, a leader of the ruling Golkar party, cited
tie-ups in drafting electoral laws.
	   Activists are skeptical that delegates to a meeting of the
People's Consultative Assembly are willing to shake off their
legacy as Suharto proteges and implement democratic reforms.
	   The 1,000-member assembly is Indonesia's highest legislative
body and includes all 500 members of Parliament.
	   Convening in the green-domed legislative building, delegates
debated whether to escalate an investigation of Suharto, who is
accused of human rights abuses and enriching his family at state
expense.
	   A minority faction in the assembly, the Muslim-based United
Development Party, argued in favor of approving a decree that would
authorize an investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   Such a decree would bolster an investigation of Suharto's
business holdings that is under way, but government prosecutors say
they have found no wrongdoing.
	   Students say the government, which is filled with former Suharto
loyalists, is too compromised by its links to the former president
to properly investigate him.
	   At the street rally, students in brightly colored university
jackets shouted slogans including, ``Habibie must step down and
Suharto must take responsibility.''
	   Thousands of people stood by, watching the marchers and
occasionally clapping and cheering. The students took a circuitous
route toward Parliament along main roads, some in densely populated
poor areas.
	   ``We will keep on protesting if our demands are not fulfilled,''
said demonstrator Lufti.
	   Violence erupted Wednesday when a car carrying student activists
plowed into a group of riot officers, injuring nine and prompting
enraged soldiers to fire warning shots and to club protesters.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto apologized for the beatings of
several protesters and three local news photographers, one of whom
he visited in a hospital.
	   On Thursday, security forces set up roadblocks and closed off
roads around Parliament. Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on
duty in the capital this week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day assembly meeting Tuesday.
Critics suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president
next year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the assembly, which includes parliamentary
legislators and presidential appointees, are also discussing
whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   The unrest in May erupted after military personnel fatally shot
four student protesters. The tumult was fueled by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades.

Japan's opposition to free-trade pact worries APEC officials
</HEADLINE>

with Malaysian official saying Mahathir will criticize some
elements of the free-trade philosophy during the APEC summit &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Asian officials criticized
Japan Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' when leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' a South Korean official said in Kuala Lumpur. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit meeting Tuesday and
Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   On Thursday, senior APEC officials began a two-day meeting to
hash out the agenda that Cabinet ministers will approve this
weekend for the summit meeting by the 21 leaders.
	   An official with the Japanese delegation, also requesting
anonymity, said Japan would not budge.
	   ``Japan won't change its position on the forestry and fishing
sectors,'' the official said. ``We won't compromise, either.''
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has accused Japan
of trying to derail the pact, saying it will fall apart unless the
world's second-largest economy approves all nine sectors.
	   The South Korean official at Thursday's APEC meeting said his
government supports the free-trade agreement, but could have
trouble selling it back home if Japan refuses to open its fishing
market. South Korea, one of worst victims of the Asian economic
crisis, relies as heavily on fishing as Japan does, and their
fishermen often share the same waters.
	   The official said other countries in the region that support the
pact could end up in arguments over its nine sectors during the
APEC summit, given how much their countries already are suffering
under Asia's 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer warned Thursday that
Japan's approach could unleash protectionist forces.
	   ``I think the threat of slippage with regard to trade worldwide
is very real,'' Fischer said in Canberra, Australia. ``I think that
would be a disastrous course, which would merely extend the present
economic difficulties.''
	   But not everyone in the APEC delegation in Malaysia was critical
of Japan's stance.
	   Alan Lai, Hong Kong's director-general of trade, said Japan's
stubbornness would not necessarily derail the tariff plan, and he
urged other nations to be flexible when negotiating the agreement.
``I would not like to say that because of one particular economy
we're not making any progress,'' he told reporters.
	   After the APEC summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to
travel to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Just like last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis,
which also has hurt Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   The United States has battled to keep the APEC response to the
crisis on the free-market road that the International Monetary Fund
has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, is expected to lead a counter assault on this free-market
philosophy, arguing that the IMF prescription has failed to halt
the crisis and has instead left many countries in deep recessions
with little prospect of an early recovery.
	   Mahathir would like an endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets, said Abdul Razak Ramli, a Malaysian official who
served as chairman of Thursday's APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``Our prime minister has often lamented about the free flow of
capital and this so-called unbridled movement causing havoc to many
markets, many economies,'' Razak said in an interview with
Associated Press Television News. ``So I think the fact that we are
championing this ... seems to suggest that it is very much part of
Kuala Lumpur's APEC agenda.''
	   Those two views are likely to dominate the discussions during
the APEC summit, but are expected to be papered over before the
final statement is issued.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ Charges of sexual misconduct and attempted
rape against track coach Kjell Arve Husby, who helped Vebjorn Rodal
win Olympic gold, were dropped Thursday due to lack of evidence.
	   Husby, 45, had been accused of sexually harassing two of his
female athletes, one of whom claimed he also tried to rape her.
Rodal, winner of the 800-meter gold at the 1996 Olympics, and the
Oppdal Athletics Club both fired the coach when the allegations
surfaced.
	   ``The police investigation has neither proved nor disproved the
allegations,'' police inspector Morten Schjetne stated in a news
release.
	   ``The police during their investigation have attempted to
clarify evidence both for and against Husby. A total of 35
witnesses were interviewed, and police cannot see how further
investigation would shed new light on the case.''
	   Husby was quoted as telling Internet newspaper Nettavisen that,
``I am glad. Beyond that, I have no comment.''
	   The charges were filed after an 18-year-old female athlete
accused Husby of sexual misconduct and a 25-year-old woman in late
September accused him of sexual harassment and attempted rape. Both
women were members of the athletics club in Oppdal, about 500
kilometers (300 miles) north of Oslo.
	   Eight members of the Oppdal club had quit in August, saying in a
letter to the club's board that they could no longer work with
Husby because some female athletes were uncomfortable with what
they felt were sexual advances by the coach.
	   In newspaper interviews at the time, Hubsy acknowledged that he
may have allowed himself to get too close to one of the women, but
denied that there was anything sexual in the relationship.
	   Husby coached Rodal for more than a decade. During the period,
Rodal took gold at the Atlanta Olympics, silver in the 1994
European Athletics Championships, and bronze in the 1995 World
Championships.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ U.S. President Bill Clinton does
not plan to meet with the wife of Malaysia's imprisoned former
deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim, the U.S. Embassy said
Thursday.
	   Azizah Ismail, wife of the ousted politician, reportedly has
expressed her wish to meet with Clinton when he attends a trade
summit in Kuala Lumpur next week.
	   However, U.S. diplomats in the Malaysian capital ruled out that
possibility.
	   ``The embassy wishes to state that there are no plans for a
meeting between President Clinton and Datin Seri Dr. Wan Azizah,
the wife of former deputy prime minister Anwar Ibrahim,'' the
embassy said in a written statement, using Azizah's formal titles.
	   The statement added that the embassy was responding to a report
by an international news agency that Azizah ``expects to meet'' the
U.S. president.
	   Azizah says she is confident she will get to talk with the
presidents of Indonesia and the Philippines when they are in the
Malaysian capital for the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Her husband is on trial on charges of corruption and sex crimes,
in what he claims is a politically motivated vendetta. Anwar was
arrested Sept. 20 after leading an anti-government rally of 30,000
people in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   Since his arrest, Azizah has become the de facto leader of
Anwar's stalled campaign for political reform, holding news
conferences and delivering statements on his behalf.
	   When Anwar's trial broke for lunch Thursday, Azizah read a
statement signed by her husband from the courthouse lock-up. It
accused Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad of nepotism and cronyism
and demanded he release a full list of government-awarded
contracts.
	   ``I wish to urge again for transparency in government
administration,'' Anwar said in the statement.
	   Anwar said that although Mahathir had disclosed a list of state
privatization projects several months ago, it left out ``the big
ones, especially those worth billions of ringgit (tens of millions
of dollars) involving the interests of his family and cronies.''
	   In an interview with APTN television, Azizah was asked what
message she had for APEC leaders.
	   ``Help (us) to speak the concerns about what is happening in our
country. My husband's case is a test case for justice,'' she
responded.

England rests Thorpe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRNS, Australia (AP) _ England has rested in-form batsman
Graham Thorpe and ignored Ben Hollioake for the final warm-up match
before the five-test Ashes series starts in Brisbane on Nov. 20.
	   Thorpe is expected to have sealed his place back in the team
following an absence through injury with his fine, unbeaten 223
against South Australia in the previous tour game. He scored the
runs despite suffering from a virus.
	   The tourists named an otherwise full strength side to play state
side Queensland in a four-day game from Friday.
	   England team manager Graham Gooch said tour selectors had a full
16 players to choose from for the match, likely to be played in
damp conditions after rain in the tropical north Queensland city
for the past few days.
	   Gooch said Hollioake had recovered from a groin strain which had
ruled him out of the opening two matches on tour. The omission
ended Hollioake's chances of playing the first two tests.
	   ``We want to give the more experienced players more cricket
before the back-to-back test matches,'' Gooch said. ``It's bad luck
on the lad but we had to be realistic.''
	   Gooch said it was likely that one of the four seamers would be
made 12th man.
	   Queensland included seven players with international experience
in its side, led by Australian wicketkeeper Ian Healy.
	   The other six are Matthew Hayden, Michael Kasprowicz, Andy
Bichel, Adam Dale, Stuart Law and Andrew Symonds.
	   England team: Alec Stewart (captain), Michael Atherton, Mark
Butcher, Nasser Hussain, John Crawley, Mark Ramprakash, Dominic
Cork, Robert Croft, Darren Gough, Dean Headley, Alan Mullally,
Angus Fraser (12th man to be named).

	   PATRAS, Greece (AP) _ A shootout between police and alleged
Albanian robbers left one suspect dead early Thursday, police said.
	   Four other suspects fled following the gun battle in the
southeastern Greek port of Patras. Three were later caught and
authorities mobilized a manhunt for the final suspect.
	   The Albanians robbed a tavern owner of about 50,000 drachmas
($175), police allege.
	   They were spotted in a town square and ordered to get out of
their car, which was reported stolen, police said. The suspects
then opened fire.

Anwar taunts foes, tales of sexual escapades fill trial

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday taunted
his foes in the Malaysian government, while his criminal trial was
brimming with tales of the former deputy prime minister's alleged
sexual escapades.
	   At one point, a police witness described how Anwar's former
driver clutched the Koran, the sacred book of Islam, as he swore
that Anwar had sodomized him.
	   The 51-year-old Anwar says he is the victim of a politically
motivated vendetta in this predominantly Muslim nation, which
usually avoids public discussion of politicians' sex lives.
	   Many Malaysians are shocked by the stories they have been
hearing from Anwar's trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges.
	   During a break in Thursday's proceedings, Anwar issued a string
of verbal taunts against the government and his one-time patron,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, despite a gag order.
	   ``There are two sets of laws, one for me and one for Dr.
Mahathir. They put me in prison and they asked me to shut up. I'm
in prison, so why are they scared?'' Anwar told a group of
reporters in the courthouse hallway.
	   He added: ``There are so many poison pen letters against the
prime minister and (the national police chief). I've seen so many
of them.''
	   Anwar's trial is already expected to drag on well into next
year, but the defendant said that if Mahathir is still in power,
``then it might go beyond the year 2000.''
	   In the courtroom, Judge Augustine Paul barred Mazlan Mohamed
Din, an assistant police commissioner who was on the witness stand,
from reading aloud a lurid account of Anwar's alleged sexual
encounters with his private secretary's wife.
	   ``This evidence is being introduced solely for its prejudicial
value,'' defense attorney Christopher Fernando complained. ``It
certainly has no probative value.''
	   Judge Paul agreed, stipulating that the documents would be
entered into the trial record, but not read aloud in the crowded
courtroom.
	   Mazlan then proceeded to describe how Anwar's former driver,
Azizan Abu Bakar, defended the truthfulness of a letter in which he
described being sodomized by Anwar last year.
	   ``He (Azizan) clasped the Koran, swearing that if he lied he
would be cursed by Allah. He swore that what was contained in the
letter is true,'' Mazlan told the court. ``Since it was a Muslim
who swore using the Koran, I find that convincing.''
	   Anwar supporters seated in the courtroom groaned at the witness'
use of religion to buttress his testimony.
	   Under questioning by the prosecution, Mazlan said Anwar gave
police direct orders to force Azizan and another key witness to
withdraw their allegations of sexual misconduct.
	   Earlier, Mazlan told the court that police tracked down the two
people and found them cowering in the master bedroom of a house
near downtown Kuala Lumpur in August 1997.
	   Members of a crack police unit took several hours to arrest them
because the owner of the house barred police from entering. A
further delay ensued when police found the bedroom door jammed.
	   ``Both targets had to be lowered through the window of the
balcony,'' Mazlan said.
	   The trial will be suspended during next week's summit of Pacific
Rim leaders in Kuala Lumpur, some of whom may be meeting with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. Any such meetings are likely to
infuriate the Malaysian government, which doesn't want the Anwar
case to become a sideshow to the summit talks.
	   Judge Paul has rejected defense attempts to show the former
Malaysian deputy prime minister is the victim of a political
conspiracy and trumped-up charges.
	   Anwar maintains the sex and corruption charges against him stem
from his rivalry with Prime Minister Mahathir.
	   He says Mahathir is losing support both at home and abroad.
	   ``Foreign leaders can no longer tolerate him any more. He's
becoming recalcitrant,'' Anwar said. He said many Malaysians also
rejected Mahathir's 17-year rule.
	   Mahathir, 72, has defended his sacking of Anwar as the country's
No. 2 official in September, and said he believed Anwar would
receive a fair trial.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A freight train collided with a commuter
bus in Sudan's capital, killing four people and injuring 50,
hospital officials said Thursday.
	   The accident took place late Wednesday in the Kalakla suburb of
Khartoum as the bus was going through an unmanned railway crossing,
the daily newspaper, Alwan, reported.
	   The train pushed the bus more than 75 meters (250 feet), turning
it upside down several times, witnesses told The Associated Press.
	   Among the injured, seven were in critical condition, said the
hospital officials, who refused to be named, said.
	   All the casualties were from the bus.

Rival Cambodian leaders open summit on forming new government

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival Cambodian leaders opened a
hastily called summit Thursday under the direction of King Norodom
Sihanouk in a new effort to break a three-month-old post-election
deadlock and form a new government.
	   The meeting opened shortly after opposition leader Prince
Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son, returned from Bangkok, Thailand,
where he had been holed up for several weeks due to fears for his
security if he stayed in Cambodia.
	   Ranariddh and senior figures of his royalist FUNCINPEC party sat
down at an oval table at the Royal Palace across from their
archrival, strongman Hun Sen, and officials of his ruling Cambodian
People's Party. Sihanouk took the head of the table.
	   Sihanouk, 76, the sole Cambodian leader considered capable of
brokering a deal to end the impasse his country has endured since
parliamentary elections in July, thanked both sides for heeding his
invitation to the summit.
	   ``We must try our best to achieve a fruitful result for the sake
of the prestige and dignity of our nation,'' Sihanouk said. ``We
are meeting to serve the cause of liberal democracy.''
	   Meetings were scheduled until late Thursday night and through
the day Friday. Sihanouk is scheduled to leave Saturday for medical
treatment in China.
	   Ranariddh told reporters before leaving Bangkok that he was
optimistic a coalition would be formed.
	   ``I think definitely we will be part of the national coalition
government,'' Ranariddh said. ``Definitely. Yes.''
	   In Phnom Penh, Ranariddh was greeted by U.S., U.N., Japanese,
Canadian and palace officials. He was quickly whisked from the
airport by his father's bodyguards.
	   Cambodia has been in limbo since Hun Sen's party failed in July
to win the two-thirds of parliamentary seats needed to form a
government alone.
	   Ranariddh and his opposition ally, former Finance Minister Sam
Rainsy, rejected Hun Sen's victory, alleging fraud and
intimidation, and blocked a government being formed. Badly needed
foreign aid has been delayed.
	   Chea Sim, the CPP's president and speaker of the National
Assembly, attended the palace talks. The assembly presidency is a
key dispute blocking agreement on a coalition.
	   The summit was hastily convened after Ranariddh and Chea Sim
asked Sihanouk earlier Thursday to organize it. Previous talks
broke down in acrimony rooted in Hun Sen's ouster of Ranariddh as
co-prime minister in a bloody coup last year.
	   ``I'm not a fortune-teller,'' said U.S. Ambassador Kenneth
Quinn, ``but all I know is, if nobody's talking, there won't be a
government formed. If they are talking, there's a chance.''
	   Both opposition leaders and many of their supporters fled the
country after the new National Assembly was formally sworn in Sept.
24, saying they feared arrest. They dismissed Hun Sen's guarantees
that they would be safe to return.
	   Sihanouk last week offered the opposition use of his palace for
security and said royal guards could escort the leaders to and from
the airport.
	   Ranariddh said the king had not invited Sam Rainsy to the
summit. Vocally anti-Hun Sen, Sam Rainsy and his 15 seats are not
needed to form a two-thirds majority in the 122-member assembly.
	   Sam Rainsy sent the prince a letter, however, wishing him
``great success'' and pledging his full support.

Athens has made better start than Sydney says Minister
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Athens is better prepared to host its
2004 Olympics than Sydney had been at the same stage, Greek
Minister for Culture Professor Evangelos Venizelos said Thursday.
	   Venizelos also cited transport as the major problem facing the
Sydney organizers (SOCOG), echoing similar sentiments from United
States IOC executive member Anita DeFrantz last month.
	   Venizelos was speaking after a meeting with Sydney 2000 Olympics
Minister Michael Knight and SOCOG chief executive Sandy Hollway.
	   ``Preparations in Athens, six years before the games is very
good,'' Venizelos said. ``We have 75 percent of the infrastructure
ready. Six years before the Sydney Olympic Games, only 40 percent
of the whole project was ready.''
	   He said progress with the construction of Athens' new
international airport, due for completion in 2002, had been
``absolutely according to schedule.''
	   Venizelos rejected suggestions the appearance of central-Athens
Omonia Square was adversely affecting the city's image and said it
had nothing to do with Athens' games preparation.
	   ``This is a problem of the management of the city, not a problem
to do with the preparation of the Olympic Games,'' he said.
	   He compared Athens' challenges in the leadup to the 2004 Games
to the problems being experienced by Sydney in planning its
transport infrastructure for the 2000 Games.
	   ``Here in Sydney, for example, the transportation problem, the
problem of circulation, is very difficult,'' Venizelos said.
	   ``Athens, not now, but in the perspective of 2004 with the new
ring road, with the new underground (railway), with the new
airport, I hope will be much better.''

Vandals damage Jewish monument in Bohemia, destroy 41 headstones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ Vandals in eastern Bohemia damaged
a cemetery monument to Jewish girls tortured by Nazis and knocked
over or smashed headstones around it, police said Thursday.
	   ``Death to Jews'' was spray-painted on the monument in Trutnov
early Wednesday, said Jaroslava Zelinkova, police spokeswoman in
the town 120 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Prague.
	   The monument and headstones were erected to commemorate 41 young
Jewish girls who were forced to work at a local textile factory
during World War II and later were tortured by the Nazis.
	   Zelinkova said a monument marking the site of a former Jewish
cemetery in Trutnov also was spray-painted by vandals.
	   There are some 10,000 Jews living in the Czech Republic, down
from the 120,000 before World War II.

	   SAARBRUECKEN, Germany (AP) _ German Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine has been recommended to succeed Jacques Santer as the
next European Commission president, German media reported Thursday.
	   A Social Democratic European parliamentarian, Klaus Haensch,
told Saarlaendischer Rundfunk radio that he is promoting Lafontaine
as a candidate for the post when it comes open in January 2000.
``It's Germany's turn to occupy this post,'' Haensch said. A German
last held the commission presidency from 1958-67.
	   Germany already has sought French support for a German
candidate, the weekly Die Zeit reported in its latest edition
issued Thursday.
	   The EU commission president must be elected by the full European
parliament.
	   Lafontaine already has substantial influence in the new Social
Democratic-led German government, occupying both the party's top
post and running the Finance Ministry as Germany joins 10 other
European countries in the monetary union launching Jan. 1.

	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ A freight train collided with a commuter
bus at an unmanned railway crossing in Sudan's capital of Khartoum,
killing four people and injuring 50 others, hospital officials said
Thursday.

South Korea fines big businesses for illegal practices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A government watchdog slapped South
Korea's five biggest conglomerates with dlrs 16 million in fines
Thursday for illegally subsidizing weak subsidiaries.
	   The fines _ the second penalties against the top businesses
since July _ came as the government of President Kim Dae-jung was
urging the nation's conglomerates to make their finances
transparent to rebuild investors' confidence in the Korean economy.
	   ``We may investigate the top conglomerates again,'' said Park
Sang-jo, a chief auditor at the Fair Trade Commission.
	   Park added that a separate investigation was under way in
smaller conglomerates accused of similar illegal trade practices.
	   The Hyundai, Samsung, Daewoo, LG and SK conglomerates were
accused of funneling a total of dlrs 1.15 billion into 21 of their
shaky subsidiaries by buying their securities above market prices.
	   Such a practice is illegal. Besides, the transactions left the
weak subsidiaries with dlrs 42 million in illegal profits, the
commission said.
	   Hyundai, South Korea's No. 1 conglomerate, was slapped with the
biggest penalty, dlrs 7 million.
	   Samsung was fined dlrs 2.3 million, Daewoo dlrs 3.4 million, LG
dlrs 1.7 million and SK dlrs 1.6 million.
	   Although long illegal, the practice of cross-funding
subsidiaries by conglomerates was condoned by the country's former
military rulers.
	   The conglomerates used cross-funding and cross-loan payment
guarantees to fuel their rapid expansion. Their units were often
accused of helping each other by buying or selling their services
and goods above or below market prices in a bid to keep their scale
of business intact.
	   A typical Korean conglomerate, or chaebol, is controlled by a
single family and has 40 to 50 subsidiaries, making everything from
computer chips to cars and ships.
	   President Kim is forcing the conglomerates to shed weak units to
become leaner and stronger.
	   In July, the commission slapped the five top conglomerates with
dlrs 58 million in similar penalties.
	   By law, the conglomerates can appeal the decision and if their
appeal is rejected they can take the commission to court.
	   The collapse of some of the weaker conglomerates fueled South
Korea's financial turmoil last year, which forced the country to
accept a record dlrs 58 billion bailout by the International
Monetary Fund.

Most Asian stock markets close lower
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Thursday as
traders sold shares following strong recent rallies on the region's
top three exchanges _ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore.
	   Fears of renewed political violence in Indonesia sent shares
tumbling 1.3 percent in Jakarta.
	   Tokyo share prices dropped amid pessimism over the Japanese
governing party's proposed economic stimulus package, while the
U.S. dollar rose against the yen on speculation the United States
was planning to attack Iraq.
	   The benchmark Nikkei Average shed 352.96 points, or 2.45
percent, closing at 14,075.06.
	   In late afternoon, the dollar bought 123.22 yen, up 2.10 yen
from late Wednesday in Tokyo and also above its New York level of
121.72 yen from late Wednesday.
	   Investors were also waiting for a possible government
announcement Monday concerning new measures to stimulate the
nation's economy, but they were not overly optimistic, traders
said.
	   ``There is a feeling of slight disappointment,'' said Masaaki
Higashida of Nomura Securities in Tokyo.
	   Meanwhile, traders rushed to buy dollars following a CBS News
report quoting White House sources as saying that an air assault on
Iraq could come soon in the latest dispute over weapons
inspections.
	   In Jakarta, fears of renewed violence over the special four-day
parliamentary session sent the benchmark JSX Composite Index
tumbling. Despite the rupiah's stability, continued student
protests rattled investor confidence.
	   The JSX Index closed down 5.031 points at 357.976.
	   All roads to parliament _ where the assembly is set to draw up
rules for general elections in 1999 _ were closed, and some 30,000
police and soldiers were on duty.
	   Markets in Taiwan were closed for a national holiday.
	   Elsewhere:
	   HONG KONG: Share prices closed lower as investors cashed in on
previous rallies and saw their spirits dampened by Tokyo's plunge.
The Hang Seng Index ended down 189.14 points, or 1.9 percent, at
9,948.18.
	   SINGAPORE: Shares closed sharply lower, dipping below the 1,200
level as investors sold following the market's recent rally. The
STI index closed down 39.63 points, or 3.2 percent, at 1,197.19.
	   SYDNEY: Prices ended lower as shares gave up gains from the
morning. The All Ordinaries index closed down 12.4 points, or 0.45
percent, at 2,708.3.
	   WELLINGTON: Prices finished higher, buoyed by overseas buying in
blue-chip Telecom Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The NZSE-40 capital
index closed up 28.15 points, or 1.4 percent, at 2,014.71.
	   MANILA: Shares rallied, holding on to gains even though prices
fell near the close. The PSE index finished up 25.92 points, or 1.5
percent, at 1,734.15.
	   BANGKOK: Prices closed down 6.5 percent on selling of shares
that had jumped last week. The SET index plunged 23.20 points to
333.06.
	   SEOUL: Prices ended higher on a rebound over the market's two
consecutive days of losses. The KOSPI index gained 2.82, or 0.70
percent, closing at 403.52.
	   KUALA LUMPUR: Prices fell, with investors cashing in on strong
performances from earlier in the week. The Composite Index fell
15.35 points, or 3.2 percent, closing at 460.77.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Two police officers were killed and two others
injured when their patrol vehicle was shattered by a land mine in
the breakaway Georgian region of Abkhazia, the Interfax news agency
reported Thursday.
	   The attack happened Wednesday in the Gali district. Abkhazian
authorities blamed the incident on Georgian irregular forces.
	   Abkhazia, a Muslim region along the Black Sea, broke away from
Georgia in the early 1990s after an independence struggle. Russian
peacekeeping forces maintain an uneasy truce between Abkhazian and
Georgian forces, but there are frequent clashes and attacks.

Taiwan executes Filipino worker despite Philippine appeal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ A firing squad in Taiwan has executed
a Filipino worker convicted of multiple murder and robbery despite
an appeal by the Philippines to defer the execution, officials said
Thursday.
	   Jonathan Burgos was executed last week after Taiwan's Supreme
Court affirmed his death sentence on Oct. 29, Foreign Secretary
Domingo Siazon said in a report to Philippine President Joseph
Estrada.
	   A Taiwanese district court sentenced Burgos to death in January
last year for murdering a Taiwanese woman and her two children,
then robbing them of 700,000 Taiwan dollars (U.S. dlrs 21,400),
Siazon said.
	   The Philippines' de facto embassy in Taipei made a strong appeal
to Taiwan President Lee Teng-hui to defer the execution and commute
Burgos' sentence to life in prison.
	   The mission provided Burgos with a lawyer and sought the help of
the Vatican, which has diplomatic ties with Taiwan, to lobby for
the execution's deferment. Manila's foreign office also helped
Burgos' wife to travel to visit him in jail early this year.
	   The Philippines has diplomatic relations with Beijing, but
maintains strong unofficial ties with Taipei. Instead of embassies,
Taiwan and the Philippines maintain economic and cultural offices,
which are de facto consular offices.

Resignation across Arab world over American attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The last time America sent forces to the
Gulf to attack Iraq, the defiance in Baghdad was perhaps matched
only by the outrage in the rest of the Arab world.
	   Palestinians paraded a model of an Iraqi Scud missile, Yemenis
jumped off buses to join anti-American protests and police had to
use attack dogs to keep demonstrators in Jordan at bay.
	   It's a different mood today. All sides, at least publicly, are
still urging a diplomatic solution. But rather than anger, there
seems to be much more resignation that an attack is inevitable.
	   ``Kuwait cannot stop a superpower from taking certain steps,''
said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister.
	   Twenty-five more U.N. employees left Iraq on Thursday, joining
233 U.N. inspectors and relief workers who departed a day earlier _
a move widely seen as a precaution against an American strike.
	   The United States and Britain have made clear they are willing
to attack Iraq for its Oct. 31 decision to halt the activities of
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and programs to build them.
	   Sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can only
be lifted once the commission certifies it's work is done. But Iraq
believes the United States, in particular, will never allow the
commission to make such a decision, making any cooperation futile.
	   Few in the region feel Iraq is prepared to back down.
	   ``The question now is what will this strike be like? What will
its size be and what will be the end?'' asked columnist Abdullah
al-Shayegi in Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper on Thursday.
	   That attitude was echoed in Al-Wafd, Egypt's most popular
opposition newspaper. Its banner headline on Thursday read, ``The
countdown begins for the strike on Iraq.''
	   No Arab government would endorse an attack on Iraq, a
politically disastrous move that would run the risk of further
inflaming widespread public anger at Washington's steadfast support
of Israel and sympathy for the Iraqi people.
	   Since the buildup began, nearly all Arab countries have voiced
support for diplomacy over war, warning that an attack would bring
_ as Qatar's foreign minister put it _ ``further catastrophes.''
	   ``I see it as my duty to warn of the dangers of prolonging the
conflict between the U.N. inspectors and the Iraqi government,''
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Wednesday night.
	   But despite the calls for a peaceful solution, diplomacy this
time seems to be less active _ and less vocal. During the last
crisis with Iraq in February, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid took the unusual step of flying to Baghdad to meet
President Saddam Hussein.
	   No such move has been suggested this time around.
	   In fact, Defense Secretary William Cohen told Arab leaders on
his tour of the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan that if the governments did
not agree with an attack, they should keep the criticism to
themselves, said Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of
anonymity.
	   A current of resentment remains, though, at what many Arabs see
as Western double-standards in the treatment of Iraq and Israel.
Many Arabs ask why Washington does not apply the same zeal in
bringing about a permanent agreement in Israeli-Palestinian talks.
	   ``This duplicity in American policy, the flagrant hostility to
Arab rights and the extreme bias in favor of Israel has proven that
the American administration has no credibility,'' said Tishrin, a
Syrian newspaper that speaks for the government.

Father squares off against opposition in case of errant son

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A Cabinet minister has urged leniency
for his son, a member of Parliament accused of attempting to run
over two policemen, while opposition politicians vowed to take
action if the courts don't resolve the case.
	   One lawmaker has pledged to quit the legislature, and the head
of Parliament has said he would ``take responsibility'' if Poonpol
Asavahame is acquitted of criminal charges, local newspapers
reported Thursday.
	   Poonpol is the 31-year-old son of Vatana Asavahame, a
businessman and political power broker who is deputy interior
minister.
	   Poonpol allegedly ran a car into two Bangkok police officers
last week as he was trying to help two friends escape from police
who had stopped them for driving without an insurance sticker.
	   After some initial reluctance on the part of the authorities,
Poonpol was charged on several criminal counts, including attempted
murder of one of the policemen.
	   Poonpol also was accused of assaulting another motorist in 1996
after a minor accident. The case did not go to trial.
	   Surathin Pimanmekhin, a retired police colonel who belongs to
the opposition New Aspiration Party, said he will quit Parliament
if Poonpol is not convicted. He gave his letter of resignation
Wednesday to Parliament president Wan Mohammed Noor Matha and asked
that it take effect if Poonpol is acquitted by the courts.
	   Wan Noor praised Surathin's act and said it showed the proper
political spirit, the newspaper The Nation reported.
	   ``If the justice system or parliamentary action cannot do
anything against the MP, I won't allow the matter to be simply
forgotten,'' Wan Noor was quoted as saying. ``As house speaker, I
am obliged to assure society that they can trust the Parliament and
that MPs should not be allowed to abuse their status.''
	   Vatana, also a member of Parliament, accused rivals of mixing
politics with Poonpol's case. In remarks published Thursday in the
Bangkok Post, he said his son should be given a ``third chance.''
	   ``Others should not try to hurt him more by turning this into a
political issue,'' Vatana said. ``Wrongdoers who feel remorse
should be forgiven.''
	   It is unusual for the rich and powerful in Thai society to face
prosecution for their alleged crimes. The issue has recently been
highlighted by a spate of high-profile incidents involving the sons
of another prominent politician, Chalerm Yubamrung, accused of
violent assaults but not prosecuted.

Monks unveil Goya's frescos of the Virgin Mary to women's eyes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZARAGOZA, Spain (AP) _ A special passageway through the
monastery's 16th Century wine cellar has been built so women can
view seven frescos of the Virgin Mary painted by Francisco Goya 200
years ago.
	   Spanish Queen Sofia on Wednesday opened the new passageway at
the Aula Dei monastery near this northern city and admired the
frescos in the chapel.
	   ``The idea was to allow women, as well as men, to see the
frescos without disturbing the monastic order,'' said Rosa
Pellicero, a spokeswoman from the local government.
	   Before the Queen opened the way, only three women _ another
member of the royal family, a judicial secretary and a female
restorer _ had seen the frescos that were painted by a 28-year-old
Goya in 1774.
	   The monks, who belong to the Roman Catholic Cartesian order and
follow strict sex-segregation norms dating back 900 years, had
agreed to the passageway after the Goya bicentenary celebrations in
1996 brought unwanted attention to their ban on women.
	   Not that the old Spanish master's frescos will suddenly be
unveiled to all and sundry.
	   Visits have to be booked, and with just one showing every month
the places are full until February 1999.

Resignation across Arab world over American attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With Iraq-UN &QL; 
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The last time America sent forces to the
Gulf to attack Iraq, the defiance in Baghdad was perhaps matched
only by the outrage in the rest of the Arab world.
	   Palestinians paraded a model of an Iraqi Scud missile, Yemenis
jumped off buses to join anti-American protests and police used
attack dogs to keep demonstrators in Jordan at bay.
	   The mood's different now. All sides, at least publicly, still
urge a diplomatic solution. But there seems to be much more
resignation that an attack is inevitable.
	   ``Kuwait cannot stop a superpower from taking certain steps,''
said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister.
	   Twenty-five more U.N. employees left Iraq on Thursday, joining
233 U.N. inspectors and relief workers who departed a day earlier _
a move widely seen as a precaution against an American strike.
	   The United States and Britain have made clear they are willing
to attack Iraq for its Oct. 31 decision to halt the activities of
the U.N. Special Commission, which is responsible for eliminating
Iraq's weapons of mass destruction and programs to build them.
	   Sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait can only
be lifted once the commission certifies its work is done. But Iraq
believes the United States, in particular, will never allow the
commission to make such a decision, making any cooperation futile.
	   Few in the region feel Iraq is prepared to back down.
	   ``The question now is what will this strike be like? What will
its size be and what will be the end?'' asked columnist Abdullah
al-Shayegi in Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper on Thursday.
	   In Egypt, the most popular opposition newspaper, Al-Wafd,
carried a banner headline on Thursday: ``The countdown begins for
the strike on Iraq.''
	   No Arab government would endorse an attack on Iraq, a
politically disastrous move that would run the risk of further
inflaming widespread public anger at Washington's steadfast support
of Israel and sympathy for the Iraqi people.
	   An attack would bring _ as Qatar's foreign minister put it _
``further catastrophes.''
	   ``I see it as my duty to warn of the dangers of prolonging the
conflict between the U.N. inspectors and the Iraqi government,''
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said Wednesday night.
	   However, diplomacy this time seems to be less active and less
vocal. During the last crisis with Iraq in February, Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid took the unusual step of
flying to Baghdad to meet President Saddam Hussein.
	   No such move has been suggested this time.
	   On his recent tour of the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan, U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen told Arab leaders that the governments
should keep criticism to themselves if they did not agree with an
attack, said Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Many Arabs see Western double-standards in the treatment of Iraq
and Israel. Many Arabs ask why Washington does not apply the same
zeal in bringing about a permanent agreement in Israeli-Palestinian
talks.
	   ``This duplicity in American policy, the flagrant hostility to
Arab rights and the extreme bias in favor of Israel has proven that
the American administration has no credibility,'' said Tishrin, a
Syrian newspaper that speaks for the government.

Chinese, SKorean presidents discuss North-South Korean relations
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ China sees tensions easing between North and
South Korea and welcomes improving relations between the two
rivals, Chinese President Jiang Zemin told South Korean President
Kim Dae-jung Thursday.
	   At the start of Kim's five-day visit, the two leaders sealed
their countries' solid ties by agreeing to a new ``partnership for
the 21st century,'' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhu Bangzao
said at a briefing.
	   Jiang and Kim signed an agreement to lay out the partnership
after their 2 1-2-hour meeting. In a speech at Peking University,
Kim later said the accord would expand cooperation to all areas
beyond the healthy economic ties they have enjoyed since opening
diplomatic relations six years ago.
	   Kim and Jiang planned to release details of the agreement in a
joint statement Friday. It was expected to include pledges of more
official visits, efforts to reduce China's dlrs 3.5 billion trade
deficit and a South Korean promise of dlrs 5.3 million in loans and
industrial cooperation.
	   Rapidly improving ties between Beijing and Seoul have
complicated political relations in Northeast Asia. China fought on
the North's side in the 1950-53 Korea War and is Pyongyang's last
remaining major communist ally, but relations have been strained in
recent years.
	   Closer relations between Beijing and Seoul were ``not directed
against any third party,'' said Zhu, the Chinese government
spokesman. ``We will continue to maintain and develop our relations
with North Korea.''
	   Jiang told Kim that China wants to safeguard peace and stability
on the Korean Peninsula and believes ``the situation on the whole
is relaxing,'' Zhu said.
	   With North and South Korea are still technically at war, China
is working with the United States to mediate peace talks and ease
tensions on the peninsula.
	   Kim told the university students he would ask Beijing to play a
more active role in the talks.
	   ``The region must be safeguarded from such weapons of mass
destruction as nuclear bombs and missiles,'' Kim said.
	   China and South Korea are each other's third largest trading
partners, with a trade volume last year of dlrs 23.7 billion.
	   South Korea also is the second largest foreign investor in
China, with South Korean companies having invested dlrs 3.5 billion
as of May.
	   Kim said China helped South Korea avoid even greater suffering
in the Asian financial crisis by resisting pressure to devalue its
currency, the yuan. A devaluation by China to spur its lagging
exports could set off another round of devaluations in Asia.
	   After their meeting, Kim and Jiang attended a signing ceremony
for agreements on cooperation in judicial affairs, simplification
of visas, youth exchanges and railways.
	   Making his first visit to China since becoming president in
February, Kim is visiting with a delegation of about 250 people,
including heads of major South Korean conglomerates.
	   Kim also is scheduled to meet with Premier Zhu Rongji, who is in
charge of China's economic reforms, and visit Shanghai, the
country's financial center.

Disputed Kuril Islands dominate Russian-Japanese summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin presented Japan's prime
minister with a plan Thursday to resolve the conflict that has
divided their nations for more than half a century _ the ownership
of the disputed Kuril Islands.
	   Yeltsin warmly greeted Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi at the
Kremlin, and later handed him Russia's long-awaited response to
Japan's proposals to settle the dispute on the Kurils.
	   The Russian plan calls for ``joint economic management'' of the
islands, said Russian Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov. Also, the two
leaders agreed to set up a subcommission to seek a solution to the
territorial dispute.
	   No additional details were released. The announcement was seen
as a sign of progress, but a final agreement is expected to be a
long, difficult process.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented
Tokyo's proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in
Japan in April. The proposals have not been made public. According
to media reports, Tokyo has suggested an arrangement that would
recognize Japanese sovereignty over the islands, but would allow
Russia to retain control for some time.
	   Meanwhile, the two leaders were expected to sign previously
resolved agreements on investment protection and cooperation in
transport, tourism and environmental protection.
	   ``It's good that our agreements are being implemented. I think
we should fulfill the program,'' Yeltsin said at the outset of the
meeting, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Still, the main task before the leaders was resolution of the
dispute over four islands in the Kurils. The islands, known to
Japanese as the Northern Territories, were once held by Tokyo but
have been controlled by Moscow since the end of World War II.
	   Both nations claim ownership, and the dispute is the main reason
the two haven't signed a formal peace treaty ending the war.
	   During a Yeltsin-Hashimoto summit a year ago, the leaders
pledged to make the utmost effort to sign a peace treaty by 2000.
But Japan wants the treaty to spell out the status of the Kurils.
	   ``I believe that our generation carries the responsibility for
making sure that the problems that have arisen in this century are
solved before it is over and are not shifted to the shoulders of
our children and grandchildren,'' Obuchi told the Russian daily
newspaper Izvestia in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in contention _
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty
with Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing
days of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since as
illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 Russian inhabitants, but the
waters around them are rich fishing grounds.
	   The summit was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting since his
latest illness sidelined him a month ago. The president's office
said Wednesday that the 67-year-old leader planned to visit Japan
next spring or summer.
	   Japan has announced plans to give an dlrs 800 million loan to
Russia. The money is part of a dlrs 22.6 billion bailout package
arranged by the International Monetary Fund this summer. But the
IMF and the World Bank have put their loans on hold after Russia
succumbed to economic crisis in August.
	   No timetable has been set for the release of the Japanese loan,
but Obuchi's spokesman Sadaaki Numata said it ``would not be a
months-long wait.''

Kosovo Albanians reported arrested, threatened
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police detained 20 Albanians on
Thursday and warned them they would be ``liquidated'' unless two
Serbs apparently abducted by separatist guerrillas were released, a
Kosovo Albanian organization said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of the main
Albanian political party in the Serbian province, said the 20 were
taken off a bus coming from Montenegro.
	   The bus was detained near the border to Montenegro, which makes
up Yugoslavia along with Serbia, said the center, adding that the
two Serbs went missing on Wednesday in the central Drenica region.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report by the
center, which is close to Ibrahim Rugova, the U.S.-supported leader
of Kosovo's majority Albanians.
	   Rugova's camp is at odds over the Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas. Both factions want Kosovo's independence from Serbia.
But Rugova opposes the KLA's armed struggle and is prepared to
settle for a return of autonomy for Kosovo, as outlined in a
U.S.-sponsored plan accepted Oct. 12 by Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic to evade threatened NATO air strikes.
	   On Thursday, a pro-KLA Kosovo Albanian political coalition
warned Rugova against plans to organized a predominantly Albanian
police force for the province as foreseen by the October plan.
	   The coalition said that the KLA was already policing Albanian
areas of Kosovo and ``statements about forming another police force
... would lead to factionalization'' of Kosovo's Albanian entity.
	   In reality, the pro and anti-Rugova factions are already deeply
split. Earlier this week, Adem Demaci, the guerillas' spokesman,
bluntly warned Rugova to butt out of organizing police, saying that
was the KLA's business. And he said the time had passed for any
attempts to paper over differences with Rugova.
	   Even if Serb authorities cooperate, Kosovo Albanian differences
could sour internationally backed attempts to implement the October
plan and start the process of Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the U.N. war crimes tribunal said
that investigations of alleged war crimes in Kosovo during the
nearly eight-month crackdown would continue, despite obstruction by
Serbian authorities.
	   Chief tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour canceled a trip to
Serbia last week after authorities refused to grant her a visa that
would permit her to visit Kosovo. The Hague-based tribunal
maintains that it has the U.N. Security Council's blessing to
investigate alleged atrocities committed during the nearly
eight-month crackdown by the Yugoslav army and Serb police that
left hundreds dead _ mostly Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of
thousands of others homeless.
	   After meeting a Kosovo Albanian delegation on Wednesday, ``the
prosecutor indicated that she intends to continue her investigation
notwithstanding the recent hiccups with the visas,'' said Deputy
Prosecutor Graham Blewitt.
	   Kosovo's violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
the province.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   Police accuse the rebels of attacking to try to provoke a harsh
response that could prompt world leaders to order military strikes.

	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Yelling pro-democracy slogans, at
least 15,000 students pushed through rows of riot officers near
Parliament Thursday in the biggest day of protest so far against a
government assembly on political reform.
	   Vastly outnumbered, police and soldiers with sticks and shields
retreated before crowds of marchers, many chanting ``Let us
through'' and waving red and white Indonesian flags.
	   Thousands of troops remained in place around Parliament, where
the nation's highest legislative body met to plot Indonesia's
transition to democracy. Students, however, accuse the People's
Consultative Assembly of trying to hinder reforms.
	   Fearing violence, banks, shops and offices closed their doors
and sent workers home early. Streets in the usually
traffic-clogged, tropical capital were clear.
	   There were no reports of clashes, but the mood recalled deadly
riots in May that shook Jakarta and helped oust former President
Suharto after 32 years of authoritarian rule.
	   This week, several protests have ended in violence pitting
students against riot police and military-backed civilian guards.
	   In a move likely to further anger students, government leaders
said that 1999 parliamentary elections were likely to be delayed
until July, two months later than President B.J. Habibie had
promised.
	   Marzuki Darusman, a leader of the ruling Golkar party, cited
tie-ups in drafting electoral laws.
	   Activists are skeptical that assembly delegates are willing to
shake off their legacy as Suharto proteges and implement democratic
reforms.
	   The 1,000-member assembly is Indonesia's highest legislative
body and includes all 500 members of Parliament.
	   Convening in the green-domed legislative building, delegates
debated whether to escalate an investigation of Suharto, who is
accused of human rights abuses and enriching his family at state
expense.
	   A minority faction in the assembly, the Muslim-based United
Development Party, argued in favor of approving a decree that would
authorize an investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   Such a decree would bolster an investigation of Suharto's
business holdings that is under way, but government prosecutors say
they have found no wrongdoing.
	   Students say the government, which is filled with former Suharto
loyalists, is too compromised by its links to the former president
to properly investigate him.
	   At the street rally, students in brightly colored university
jackets shouted slogans including, ``Habibie must step down and
Suharto must take responsibility.''
	   Thousands of people stood by, watching the marchers and
occasionally clapping and cheering. The students took a circuitous
route toward Parliament along main roads, some in densely populated
poor areas.
	   ``We will keep on protesting if our demands are not fulfilled,''
said demonstrator Lufti.
	   Near Parliament, one group of students broke up a police line by
driving slowly through in buses. Others wearing headbands gunned
motorcycle engines and sang protest songs.
	   Violence erupted Wednesday when a car carrying student activists
plowed into a group of riot officers, injuring nine and prompting
enraged soldiers to fire warning shots and to club protesters.
	   Military chief Gen. Wiranto apologized for the beatings of
several protesters and three local news photographers, one of whom
he visited in a hospital.
	   Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on duty in the capital this
week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day assembly meeting Tuesday.
Critics suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president
next year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the assembly, which includes parliamentary
legislators and presidential appointees, are also discussing
whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   The unrest in May erupted after military personnel fatally shot
four student protesters. The tumult was fueled by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades.

Director Peter Cotes, who staged first `Mousetrap,' dies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Actor and director Peter Cotes, celebrated for
staging the first theater production of Agatha Christie's venerable
``Mousetrap'' in 1952, has died. He was 86.
	   Cotes died ``peacefully'' Tuesday at his home in the middle
England village of Chipping Norton, according to death notices
published in British newspapers.
	   Cotes was best-known for his hit production ``Pick-Up Girl'' in
1946, which was denied a license by the censor but received the
go-ahead after Queen Mary, the Queen Mother, came to see it. The
play was an American tale of child abuse and venereal disease.
	   Born in Maidenhead in 1912, Cotes was the oldest son of parents
who had run a theater company in South Africa. His career got off
to a quick start when, at age 4, he was handed over the footlights
at the Portsmouth Hippodrome with a bouquet for a performer, The
Guardian newspaper reported.
	   As a director, Cotes argued against the trend where actors were
becoming stars, overshadowing the plays.
	   Along with his late wife, the actress Joan Miller, he became a
major force in serious British theater throughout the 1940s and
1950s by establishing his own theater group.
	   In the '50s and '60s, he also directed feature films and
television dramas, but theater remained his first love.
	   Cotes also wrote several books, including a biography of Charlie
Chaplin in 1951.
	   Funeral arrangements were not known.

Monks unveil Goya's frescos of the Virgin Mary to women's eyes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZARAGOZA, Spain (AP) _ More women can now view seven frescos of
the Virgin Mary painted 200 years ago by Francisco Goya at the Aula
Dei monastery.
	   On Wednesday, Queen Sofia opened a special passageway built in
the 16th-century wine cellar of the monastery in northeastern Spain
near Zaragoza.
	   ``The idea was to allow women, as well as men, to see the
frescos without disturbing the monastic order,'' said Rosa
Pellicero, a local government spokeswoman.
	   Before the special passageway, only three women _ another member
of the royal family, a judicial secretary and a female restorer _
had seen the frescos painted in the chapel by a 28-year-old Goya in
1774.
	   The monks, who belong to the Roman Catholic Cartesian order and
follow strict sex-segregation norms dating back 900 years, agreed
to the passageway after the Goya bicentenary celebrations in 1996
brought unwanted attention to their ban on women.
	   Not that the old Spanish master's frescos will suddenly be
unveiled to all.
	   Visits have to be booked, and with just one showing every month,
reservations are full until February.

Cooking oil prices rising in Philippines due to shortfall
</HEADLINE>
speculation &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ The price of cooking oil in the
Philippines has risen drastically this month because of retailers
speculating on a shortfall in copra production, the government said
Thursday.
	   Norberto Boceta, deputy administrator of the Philippine Coconut
Authority, said the price of cooking oil has jumped by as much as
50 percent this month from prices posted in the first quarter.
	   Boceta said in a letter to the Department of Trade and Industry
that the increase was spurred by retailers speculating on a
``perceived copra production shortfall due to the effects of El
Nino and the two super typhoons.''
	   Coconut oil is the main ingredient in cooking oil manufactured
in the Philippines. It is extracted from copra, the dried white
meat of the coconut.
	   The country's copra production is expected to drop below 2
million metric tons this year as a result of the drought brought by
the El Nino weather phenomenon, which hit coconut farms during the
latter part of 1997.
	   The two typhoons that recently hit the country, Zeb and Babs,
have also hurt coconut crops. Babs, in particular, ravaged the
Bicol region, a large coconut-producing area.
	   With hefty 1997 carry-over stocks gradually depleting, the
losses brought by El Nino and the typhoons are now affecting the
supply of copra.
	   Boceta said speculator activity also takes into account that the
last quarter of the year ordinarily is a lean harvest season.
	   But Boceta is confident that the inflated market will soon give
way to supply and demand dynamics.
	   A spokeswoman for the coconut administration office said the
price increase only affects local consumers and that the situation
is likely to normalize in a few weeks.

Evans departure expected Thursday, Houllier to take charge
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Roy Evans was expected to step down as
co-manager of Liverpool on Thursday, leaving Frenchman Gerard
Houllier in sole charge of the struggling Premier League club.
	   British newspapers reported that Evans, who has been with
Liverpool for 33 years as a player, coach and manager, reached a
settlement to leave the club in a meeting Wednesday night with
chairman David Moores.
	   An official announcement was expected Thursday that Evans was
leaving by ``mutual consent.''
	   The papers said Evans declined an offer to accept another
position with Liverpool and instead negotiated severance terms to
cut his links with the club.
	   Evans' assistant, Doug Gilmore, was also expected to leave.
	   The move will leave Houllier, the former French national coach
and technical director, in charge for Saturday's home game against
Leeds.
	   Houllier will be the first foreigner to have full control at
Anfield in the club's 106-year history. He is expected to bring in
fellow Frenchman Patrice Bergues, a Liverpool coach, as his
assistant.
	   Houllier will be the second Frenchman in sole charge of a
Premier League club, joining Arsene Wenger, who guided Arsenal to
the League and Cup double last season.
	   Evans departure appeared inevitable after Tuesday night's
humiliating 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham in a League Cup game. That
followed last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield to Derby, leaving
the Reds in 11th place in the bottom half of the Premier League
standings.
	   To make matters worse, 18-year-old striker Michael Owen could be
out for up to a month after suffering a hamstring injury against
Spurs, and midfielder Steve McManaman is sidelined for at least six
weeks with an Achilles problem.
	   Houllier will face a huge challenge in trying to recapture the
glory days at Liverpool, one of the world's most famous and
decorated clubs.
	   The Reds have won a record 18 English league championships, five
FA Cups, five League Cups, four European Cups and two UEFA Cups.
But Liverpool has been eclipsed in the 1990s as England's top club
by Manchester United, league champion in four of the last six
seasons.
	   Evans took over as Liverpool manager in January 1994 after the
resignation of Graeme Souness. The only trophy won by Liverpool
during Evans' reign was the lightly regarded League Cup in 1995.
	   Speculation over Evans' position grew when the club brought in
Houllier this summer to work alongside him in the unusual
arrangement of co-manager.
	   Since going to the top of the table on Sept. 9, the Reds have
won only three games _ against Fulham in the League Cup, Kosice in
the UEFA Cup and Nottingham Forest in the Premiership.
	   Evans admitted Wednesday that the pressure was taking its toll.
	   ``The speculation has been very difficult to live with,'' he
said. ``I have done this job with honesty and integrity and seeing
the club suffer does affect me badly.''
	   Evans' departure signals the end of the ``Bill Shankly era'' at
Anfield. Shankly created a dynasty that produced a string of
successful managers such as Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish
and Ronnie Moran.
	   Evans' depature marks the fourth management shakeup in the
Premier League this season after changes at Tottenham, Newcastle
and Leeds.
	   Dalglish was fired as Newcastle boss and replaced by Ruud
Gullit, George Graham left Leeds to take over for Christian Gross
at Spurs, and David O'Leary succeeded Graham at Leeds.

UN agency boosts aid to hurricane victims in Central America
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ A U.N. agency on Wednesday boosted its deliveries of
food aid to the tens of thousands of people whose homes and crops
were destroyed by Hurricaine Mitch and now risk malnourishment and
disease.
	   The Rome-based World Food Program said it would distribute
116,238 tons of food over the next six months to people in
Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador.
	   Mitch killed an estimated 10,000 people and left tens of
thousands homeless.
	   About 60 percent of the food aid will go to women and children
under six who live in rural communities where the traditional
livelihood of subsistence farming has been destroyed and most
people lack cash to buy food.
	   ``Without emergency assistance, these people are at extreme
nutritional risk -- in addition to facing the threat of cholera and
other diseases from unsanitary conditions throughout the region,''
Catherine Bertini, WFP executive director, said in a statement.
	   The agency said it would distribute mainly rice, maize, canned
fish and vegetable oil, for a total value of approximately dlrs 58
million.

Argentine bomb scare delays Chile's presidential trip to South
</HEADLINE>
Africa &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ A bomb threat on board a
commercial airliner in Argentina on Thursday delayed the flight of
Chile's President Eduardo Frei, who was headed to South Africa on
his first official state visit.
	   South African foreign affairs officials said Frei's arrival
would be delayed about five hours, until 4 p.m. local time (1400
gmt).
	   Frei's scheduled commercial flight was delayed at Ezeiza airport
in Buenos Aires after an anonymous call about a bomb in a suitcase
on the plane, said foreign affairs spokeswoman Adri Cronje.
	   After a five-hour search, Argentine security officials allowed
the plane to take off, she said. The name of the airline was not
known.
	   An official state banquet would be held Thursday night, Cronje
said.

Kosovo Albanians reported arrested, threatened
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police detained 20 Albanians on
Thursday and warned them that they would be ``liquidated'' unless
two abducted Serbs were released, a Kosovo Albanian organization
said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of the main
Albanian political party in the southern Serbian province, said the
20 were taken off a bus from nearby Montenegro, the smaller of the
two republics, along with Serbia, that make up Yugoslavia .
	   The two Serbs were apparently abducted Wednesday by separatist
guerrillas in Kosovo's central Drenica region, the center said.
There was no independent confirmation of the report by the center,
which is close to Ibrahim Rugova, the U.S.-supported leader of
Kosovo's majority Albanians.
	   Rugova's camp is at odds with the Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas. Both factions want Kosovo's independence, but Rugova
opposes the KLA's armed struggle and is prepared to settle for a
return of autonomy for Kosovo, as outlined in a U.S.-sponsored plan
accepted Oct. 12 by Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic to evade
threatened NATO air strikes.
	   On Thursday, a pro-KLA Kosovo Albanian political coalition
warned Rugova against plans to organized a predominantly Albanian
police force for Kosovo as foreseen by the October plan.
	   The coalition said the KLA was already policing Albanian areas
of Kosovo and ``statements about forming another police force ...
would lead to factionalization'' of Kosovo's Albanian entity.
	   The pro and anti-Rugova factions are already deeply split.
Earlier this week, Adem Demaci, the guerillas' spokesman, bluntly
warned Rugova to stay out of organizing police, saying that was the
KLA's business. Also, the time had passed for any attempts to paper
over differences with Rugova, he said.
	   Even if Serb authorities cooperate, Kosovo Albanian differences
could sour internationally backed attempts to implement the October
plan and start the process of Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the U.N. war crimes tribunal said
investigations of alleged war crimes in Kosovo during the nearly
eight-month crackdown would continue, despite obstruction by
Serbian authorities.
	   Chief tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour canceled a trip to
Serbia last week after authorities refused to grant her a visa to
visit Kosovo. The Hague-based tribunal maintains it has the U.N.
Security Council's blessing to investigate alleged atrocities
committed by the Yugoslav army and Serb police that left hundreds
dead _ mostly Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of thousands of
others homeless.
	   After meeting a Kosovo Albanian delegation on Wednesday, ``the
prosecutor indicated that she intends to continue her investigation
notwithstanding the recent hiccups with the visas,'' said Deputy
Prosecutor Graham Blewitt.
	   Kosovo's violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
the province.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   Police accuse the rebels of attacking to try to provoke a harsh
response that could prompt world leaders to order military strikes.

Russian lawmakers look at approving nuclear arms reduction treaty
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BARRY RENFREW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian parliamentary leaders agreed Thursday to
revise a bill that could pave the way for ratification of the
stalled START II treaty on sharply reducing Russian and U.S.
nuclear arsenals.
	   Gennady Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma, the lower chamber
of parliament, said a new version of the bill had been drawn up by
several parliamentary committees and was ready for consideration by
the chamber and the government. He said the bill could be acted
upon in weeks if President Boris Yeltsin accepts its provisions.
	   ``If the president agrees (with our final version), we'll put it
on the agenda for ratification,'' he said.
	   START II would cut Russian and U.S. nuclear arsenals in half to
3,500 warheads each. START II was signed by both nations in 1993
and the U.S. Senate ratified it in 1996.
	   The revised bill in the State Duma, parliament's lower house,
contains unspecified stipulations and conditions on which lawmakers
insist after two years of debate, Seleznyov said. In particular,
the bill would specify how the agreement would be implemented and
financed, he said.
	   Lawmakers objected to Yeltsin's call to approve START II because
it only gave lawmakers the option of ratifying the treaty without
spelling out other details, he said.
	   It was not clear if the United States would accept any changes
or revisions raised as conditions for the Duma to approve the
treaty.
	   The Duma repeatedly delayed action on START II with Communist
and nationalist deputies charging it would weaken Russia and be too
expensive too implement. The government of Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, who took office in September, has made a major effort to
get the treaty approved.
	   Some Russian officials have indicated that the government hopes
that quick ratification of the START II would improve Russia's
prospects of receiving much-needed aid from the International
Monetary Fund to tackle the country's economic crisis.
	   Roman Popkovich, head of the Duma's Defense Committee, said
Thursday that ratification of START II would enhance Russia's
defense capability. The treaty would allow Russia to devote large
sums of money to developing new weapons and reviving the
cash-strapped military, he told the Interfax news agency.
	   He said Duma deputies were concerned about such issues as the
expansion of NATO and deployment of nuclear forces and NATO forces
closer to the Russian border. But he claimed that possible
revisions of the treaty would not alter the ``essence'' of the
treaty.

	   ROME (AP) _ Rome's latest efforts to open up business to
competition are parked at the curb these days, along with lots of
taxis going nowhere.
	   A bid by the mayor to give taxi customers a little bargaining
power and get more cabs cruising the cobblestones has left the
capital cab-less for much of this fall.
	   After weeks of sporadic one-day strikes, drivers kept their cabs
parked for four straight days through Thursday, when several
thousand taxi drivers from Milan and elsewhere in Italy converged
on the capital and marched in solidarity with their Roman
colleagues downtown.

Cuba beats China, retains world women's volleyball championship

	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ Olympic champion Cuba overpowered China
15-4, 16-14, 15-12 Thursday, keeping its women's world volleyball
championship as well.
	   The title was Cuba's third overall. It first won in 1978 in
Leningrad, ending more than two decades of Soviet and Japanese
domination of the championships.
	   China, the world champion in 1982 and 1986, gained its second
silver medal. It also was runner-up in Beijing in 1990, when the
then Soviet Union won the gold and the United States took the
bronze.
	   Cuba needed only 15 minutes to win the first set, with Regla
Bell McKenzie, Regla Torres Herrera and Ana Fernandez Valle leading
in serves, blocks, spikes and defense.
	   China, the Asian champion and Olympic silver medalist, rallied
in the second set, tying the Cubans 10 times through 14. Then it
lost two key points, one by not playing a serve that the Chinese
thought would be out.
	   The Chinese, led by Qiu Aihua, Sun Yue and Wu Yongmei, went
ahead 12-7 in the final set before the Cubans rallied for eight
straight points and the championship.
	   In the match for third place, Russia overcame a slow start and
beat 1996 Olympic bronze medalist Brazil 13-15, 15-6, 15-11, 15-13.
	   Natalia Morozova's serves led Russia to an 8-1 first-set lead,
but the Brazilians tied it at 12 and went on to win, helped by the
attacking, blocking and retrieving of Ana Moser.
	   The Russians won the next two sets by tightening their defense,
blocking Moser, and diversifying their attacking patterns.
	   In the final set, Moser managed to lead Brazil to a 12-4 lead,
but that was as far as her tired team could go.
	   ``After the '96 Atlanta Olympic Games, I've changed the
composition of the team and young players joined,'' Russian coach
Nikolai Karpol said. ``I'm satisfied with that third place with a
young team.''
	   In the game for fifth place, Italy outclassed Croatia 15-7,
15-10, 15-8, gaining its best place ever in a world championship.
Italy's best previous finish was ninth place.
	   Anna Vania Mello led the Italians with eight points, followed by
Elisa Galastri's seven and Francesca Piccinini's six.
	   Italian team captain Maurizia Cacciatori said she was just happy
to place fifth with a squad of many young and new players, which
was organized in preparation for the 2000 Olympics. Ten of the 18
Italian players are 21 or younger. The team's average age is 21.8.
	   For seventh place, the Netherlands outclassed host Japan 15-12,
3-15, 15-10, 15-8.
	   The men's world championship starts Friday and ends Nov. 29 in
Japan.

Study: Popular herbal supplement does little for common cold
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORTLAND, Oregon (AP) _ The top-selling herbal supplement
echinacea apparently has little effect on the common cold,
according to a study published Thursday in the Archives of Family
Medicine.
	   Echinacea, an extract from the coneflower, was no better at
preventing colds than a placebo, the study said.
	   The study is among various research into the effectiveness of
alternative medicine being published this week by the Journal of
the American Medical Association and its sister publications,
including the Archives of Family Medicine.
	   Echinacea has gained vast popularity as the number of Americans
using herbal therapies has grown to almost one in five, according
to a national study published this year.
	   Echinacea comes in pill or tincture form and often contains two
or more species, even using the root. It may be mixed with other
ingredients such as zinc.
	   But scientists are unsure which of the eight species of plants
that provide echinacea might be most effective, what part of the
plant should be used and how high a dosage is needed.
	   Research in Germany _ home of most of the research on echinacea
_ suggests it increases the number of white blood cells and buoys
the body's ability to gobble up invading organisms.
	   But according to Thursday's study, also by doctors in Germany,
there were no significant differences among the people given
echinacea or a placebo.
	   The study of 289 healthy people used two species, Echinacea
angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea. One group of participants took
the angustifolia, one took the purpurea and a third took a placebo.
	   The study's authors emphasized the need for more research.
	   Dr. Bruce Goldberg, an associate professor of family medicine at
Oregon Health Sciences University who is studying the herb,
cautioned against putting too much weight on the study.
	   ``We have very little information on which to base any sort of
strategy,'' he said. ``We don't know what dose, what preparation,
for how long, whether there might be some populations of
individuals who benefit from this and others who don't.''

Dutch crew struggles to contain spill from burning freighter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KEIL, Germany (AP) _ A Dutch crew worked Thursday to contain an
oil spill from a burning freighter abandoned off the German coast
in the North Sea during storms two weeks ago. More than 1,000 birds
have died in the spill, and another 15,000 are covered with oil.
	   The spill, some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) long and 80 meters (87
yards) wide, has already reached the beaches of two German islands,
Sylt and Amrum, but officials said that heavy rain was helping to
rinse the oil back to sea.
	   The rain also lessened fears that the spill would endanger
seals. One animal, covered in oil, was shot and killed yesterday,
but wildlife officials no longer expect a major threat to the
region's seal population, most of which is farther north this time
of year.
	   A platform was being sent from the Netherlands to pump 600 tons
of oil still on board the freighter ``Pallas,'' where fires still
smoldered two weeks after it capsized in stormy seas and the crew
abandoned ship.
	   Heavy storms at the time prevented firefighting crews from
boarding the freighter, or rescue vessels from getting close enough
to disembark the crew, forcing them to jump overboard.
	   The 147-meter (482 foot) freighter, abandoned off the Danish
coast, has since drifted closer to Germany, despite attempts to
anchor it.

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ Most Asian stock markets fell Thursday as
traders sold shares following strong recent rallies on the region's
top three exchanges _ Tokyo, Hong Kong and Singapore. Fears of
renewed political violence in Indonesia sent shares tumbling 1.3
percent in Jakarta. Tokyo share prices dropped amid pessimism over
the Japanese governing party's proposed economic stimulus package,
while the U.S. dollar rose against the yen on speculation the
United States was planning to attack Iraq. The benchmark Nikkei
Average shed 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent, closing at 14,075.06.
In late afternoon, the dollar bought 123.22 yen, up 2.10 yen from
late Wednesday in Tokyo. In Jakarta, fears of renewed violence over
the special four-day parliamentary session sent the benchmark JSX
Composite Index tumbling. The JSX Index closed down 5.031 points at
357.976. (ASIAN MARKETS)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ In the broadest effort yet to jumpstart the world's
second-largest economy, Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's
ruling party outlined plans Thursday for the country's biggest
stimulus package ever. The Liberal Democratic Party proposals will
form the basis of an official government plan to be formally
announced on Monday and expected to be passed later this month in a
special session of Parliament. The centerpiece of the party's
package calls for 10 trillion yen (dlrs 81 billion) in public
works-related spending through next March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs
33 billion) in income tax cuts next year. With the addition of
corporate tax cuts and other tax relief measures, it was expected
to total a record 18 trillion yen (dlrs 147 billion). The widely
expected package was compiled in a bid to prevent Japan's economy
from shrinking for a third consecutive year and to fulfill Obuchi's
pledge to engineer a recovery within two years. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Asian officials criticized
Japan on Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis. ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' before
leaders of Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific
nations hold their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but
I don't think so,'' a South Korean official said in Kuala Lumpur.
He spoke on condition of anonymity. The United States, Australia
and Canada are pushing the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade
summit on Tuesday and Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs
in nine sectors covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
(APEC)
	   PARIS (AP) _ France's finance minister weighed in on a European
dispute over interest rates Thursday, saying economic conditions
would allow for lower rates in France and Germany. Dominique
Strauss-Kahn also said France will be able to fulfill budget
requirements for the euro for the next several years. ``France is
ready for the euro,'' Strauss-Kahn said on RTL radio. On interest
rates, he said: ``It's for central bankers to determine interest
rate policy, but there are many objective conditions _ in
particular a very low inflation rate _ that lead me to believe it
wouldn't be unreasonable to have lower rates.'' The comments
highlight an ongoing dispute between European politicians and
central bankers over the need for rate cuts to spur economic
growth. (FRANCE-ECONOMY)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ In a breakthough for
international efforts to reduce global warming, Argentina and
Kazakstan have are the first developing countries to voluntarily
cut back on greenhouse gas emissions. President Carlos Menem
announced during a U.N. summit that Argentina would seek to join
industrialized countries already bound by a 1997 treaty to reduce
carbon dioxide output by 2012. ``Not only can highly advanced
countries contribute to a new world order, but also emerging
nations,'' Menem told delegates from over 160 nations. The
announcement gave a boost to U.S. efforts at the summit to
encourage developing countries to voluntarily commit to reducing
their emissions of greenhouse gases _ pollutants caused primarily
by motor vehicles and power plants. And in another diplomatic
victory, the chief U.S. climate change negotiator announced late
Wednesday the former Soviet republic of Kazakstan was ready to make
a similar commitment. (GLOBAL WARMING)

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A second batch of United Nations relief
workers left Iraq by bus on Thursday, and the ruling party's
newspaper condemned the increasing possibility of U.S. airstrikes
as American ``psychological warfare.'' U.N. humanitarian program
spokesman Eric Falt said 25 workers left instead of the 40 that
officials initially decided would go. He did not elaborate. In
addition, all 103 U.N. weapons inspectors went to Bahrain by air on
Wednesday. About 295 humanitarian workers are now left in Iraq,
mostly in the Kurdish north that is unlikely to be targeted.
Despite mounting military threats, Iraq showed no sign of backing
down from its refusal to allow the resumption of arms inspections.
Newspapers published a statement by the ruling Baath party urging
Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at American interests
in case of U.S. aggression. (IRAQ-UN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A day after ratifying the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinians, Israel announced Thursday it would
begin construction of a large Jewish neighborhood in a sector of
Jerusalem claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital.
Palestinian spokesman Ahmed Tibi denounced the action as a
violation of the peace accords that would ``bring a serious
response'' and demanded U.S. intervention. U.S. Mideast envoy
Dennis Ross, who is returning to the region to supervise
implementation of the peace agreement, is to meet Friday with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's decision to give the go-ahead for construction of the
Har Homa neighborhood in traditionally Arab east Jerusalem came
after months of delay. It was seen as an attempt to blunt the
criticism by hard-line Cabinet ministers, coalition allies and key
constituents. (ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Yelling pro-democracy slogans, at
least 15,000 students on Thursday pushed through rows of riot
officers near parliament, which was planning Indonesia's transition
to democracy. Students, however, accuse the People's Consultative
Assembly of trying to hinder reforms. Fearing violence, banks,
shops and offices closed their doors and sent workers home early on
Thursday, the biggest day of protest so far. There were no reports
of clashes, but the mood recalled deadly riots in May that shook
Jakarta and helped oust former President Suharto after 32 years of
authoritarian rule. This week, several protests have ended in
violence pitting students against riot police and military-backed
civilian guards. (INDONESIA-POLITICS)
	   LONDON (AP) _ While emotional demonstrators chant outside and
lawyers inside calmly debate if torture is acceptable government
policy, Britain's highest court were deciding whether to free
Chile's arrested former dictator, Gen. Augusto Pinochet. Thursday's
hearing before a five-judge panel in the House of Lords was
scheduled to conclude deliberations, in their sixth day, with
lawyers for Spanish and British prosecutors making a final plea
that some crimes are beyond all immunity. Judgment may be delivered
next week. International law expert David Lloyd-Jones submitted a
``friend of the court'' brief suggesting that Britain's 1978 State
Immunity Act might give protection from arrest for acts that were
``part of some state policy, however terrible that policy might
be.'' (BRITAIN-PINOCHET)
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Rival Cambodian leaders hastily
opened a summit Thursday under the direction of King Norodom
Sihanouk to try to break a three-month post-election deadlock and
form a new government. The meeting opened shortly after opposition
leader Prince Norodom Ranariddh, the king's son, returned from
Bangkok, Thailand, where he had been holed up for several weeks
fearing for his security if he stayed in Cambodia. Ranariddh and
senior figures of his royalist FUNCINPEC party sat down at an oval
table at the Royal Palace across from their rival, strongman Hun
Sen, and officials of his ruling Cambodian People's Party. Sihanouk
took the head of the table. Sihanouk, 76, the sole Cambodian leader
considered capable of brokering a deal to end the impasse his
country has endured since parliamentary elections in July, thanked
both sides for heeding his invitation to the summit.

Divers should recover bodies of 1994 ferry disaster, panel says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LENNART SIMONSSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Divers should try to recover as many
bodies as possible from the Baltic Sea ferry Estonia that sank in
1994, killing 852 people, a government-appointed panel recommended
Thursday.
	   Then prime minister Ingvar Carlsson promised that four years
ago, but the next government decided to leave the 757 missing
bodies buried at sea. That much-criticized policy now may be
reversed.
	   The wreck lies about 54 meters (180 feet) below the sea surface,
some 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the Finnish port of Turku.
The ferry was travelling at night under very heavy seas from
Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm.
	   Only 95 bodies were recovered and identified, and 137 survived.
The government planned to entomb the boat under tons of sand,
concrete and rocks to prevent plundering, but many victims'
relatives demanded the bodies be recovered or the entombment money
used for compensation.
	   The estimated cost of entombment was 350 million kronor (dlrs 52
million).
	   The panel, chaired by Peter Oern, secretary-general of the
Swedish Red Cross, was set up to investigate how civil authorities
responded to the Sept. 28, 1994, disaster. It also aimed to restore
public trust in them.
	   ``We believe that many relatives can't complete their mourning
without efforts to recover their loved ones,'' Oern was quoted as
saying Thursday by the national news agency TT.
	   ``This would likely restore confidence in society,'' the panel
said about its recommendation to recover the bodies.
	   Polls indicate that a majority of the relatives wanted to
salvage the bodies.
	   If the government of Prime Minister Goeran Persson decides to
accept the panel's recommendation, divers would attempt to recover
the bodies of the victims.
	   The panel said it did not recommend that the ferry should be
salvaged or the wreck entombed.
	   ``This is a great relief. We have waited four years for this,''
Lennart Berglund, whose mother- and father-in-law died in the
sinking, said on Swedish national TV.
	   Berglund is chairman of the Foundation for Estonia Victims and
Relatives.

Kosovo Albanians reported arrested, threatened

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by U.S. envoy.

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police detained 20 Albanians on
Thursday and warned them they would be ``liquidated'' unless two
Serbs apparently abducted by separatist guerrillas were released, a
Kosovo Albanian organization said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of the main
Albanian political party in the Serbian province, said the 20 were
taken off a bus coming from Montenegro.
	   The bus was detained near the border to Montenegro, which makes
up Yugoslavia along with Serbia, said the center, adding that the
two Serbs went missing on Wednesday in the central Drenica region.
	   There was no independent confirmation of the report by the
center, which is close to Ibrahim Rugova, the U.S.-supported leader
of Kosovo's majority Albanians.
	   Rugova's camp is at odds with supporters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas. Both factions want Kosovo's
independence from Serbia. But Rugova opposes the KLA's armed
struggle and is prepared to settle for a return of autonomy for
Kosovo, as outlined in a U.S.-sponsored plan accepted Oct. 12 by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic under the threat of NATO air
strikes.
	   On Thursday, a pro-KLA Kosovo Albanian political coalition
warned Rugova against plans to organized a predominantly Albanian
police force for the province as foreseen by the October agreement.
	   The coalition said that the KLA was already policing Albanian
areas of Kosovo and ``statements about forming another police force
... would lead to factionalization'' of Kosovo's Albanian entity.
	   In reality, the pro and anti-Rugova factions are already deeply
split. Earlier this week, Adem Demaci, the guerillas' spokesman,
bluntly warned Rugova to butt out of organizing police, saying that
was the KLA's business. And he said the time had passed for any
attempts to paper over differences with Rugova.
	   Even if Serb authorities cooperate, Kosovo Albanian differences
could sour internationally backed attempts to implement the October
plan and start the process of Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   The U.S. envoy to Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
the October agreement was taking shape, ``but we have a long way to
go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet William Walker, the American head
of a still-forming team of Kosovo observers, said he would be going
to Belgrade on Friday to meet authorities there on implementation
of the autonomy plan.
	   Later Thursday, Walker was planning to see off 17 members of
what will be a 2,000-strong monitoring team of the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe before the 17 set up base in the
southern town of Prizren.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the U.N. war crimes tribunal said
that investigations of alleged war crimes in Kosovo during the
nearly eight-month crackdown would continue, despite obstruction by
Serbian authorities.
	   Chief tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour canceled a trip to
Serbia last week after authorities refused to grant her a visa that
would permit her to visit Kosovo. The Hague-based tribunal
maintains that it has the U.N. Security Council's blessing to
investigate alleged atrocities committed during the nearly
eight-month crackdown by the Yugoslav army and Serb police that
left hundreds dead _ mostly Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of
thousands of others homeless.
	   After meeting a Kosovo Albanian delegation on Wednesday, ``the
prosecutor indicated that she intends to continue her investigation
notwithstanding the recent hiccups with the visas,'' said Deputy
Prosecutor Graham Blewitt.
	   Kosovo's violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
the province.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   Police accuse the rebels of attacking to try to provoke a harsh
response that could prompt world leaders to order military strikes.

Police fire warning shots and tear gas at student protest

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot officers fired warning shots and
tear gas Thursday to disperse thousands of students near Parliament
during the biggest day of protest so far against a government
assembly on political reform.
	   The demonstration turned violent after vastly outnumbered police
and soldiers had failed to block marchers, many chanting ``Let us
through'' and waving red and white Indonesian flags.
	   Students scattered as officers fired shots in the air. Security
forces had been ordered to carry blanks and plastic bullets. It was
not known if there were injuries.
	   The protesters had been trying to march to Parliament, where the
nation's highest legislative body met to plot Indonesia's
transition to democracy. Students, however, accuse the 1,000-member
People's Consultative Assembly of trying to hinder reforms.
	   Fearing violence, banks, shops and offices had closed their
doors and sent workers home early. Streets in the usually
traffic-clogged, tropical capital were clear.
	   The mood recalled deadly riots in May that shook Jakarta and
helped oust former President Suharto after 32 years of
authoritarian rule.
	   This week, several protests have ended in violence pitting
students against riot police and military-backed civilian guards.
	   In a move likely to further anger students, government leaders
said that 1999 parliamentary elections were likely to be delayed
until July, two months later than President B.J. Habibie had
promised.
	   Marzuki Darusman, a leader of the ruling Golkar party, cited
tie-ups in drafting electoral laws.
	   Activists are skeptical that assembly delegates are willing to
shake off their legacy as Suharto proteges and implement democratic
reforms.
	   Convening in the green-domed legislative building, delegates
debated whether to escalate an investigation of Suharto, who is
accused of human rights abuses and enriching his family at state
expense.
	   A minority faction in the assembly, the Muslim-based United
Development Party, argued in favor of approving a decree that would
authorize an investigation of Suharto's wealth.
	   Such a decree would bolster an investigation of Suharto's
business holdings that is under way, but government prosecutors say
they have found no wrongdoing.
	   Students say the government, which is filled with former Suharto
loyalists, is too compromised by its links to the former president
to properly investigate him.
	   Earlier, as students in brightly colored university jackets made
their way to Parliament, they shouted slogans including, ``Habibie
must step down and Suharto must take responsibility.''
	   Thousands of people stood by, watching the marchers and
occasionally clapping and cheering. The students took a circuitous
route along main roads, some in densely populated poor areas.
	   ``We will keep on protesting if our demands are not fulfilled,''
said demonstrator Lufti.
	   Near Parliament, one group of students broke up a police line by
driving slowly through in buses. Others wearing headbands gunned
motorcycle engines and sang protest songs.
	   Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on duty in the capital this
week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day assembly meeting Tuesday.
Critics suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president
next year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the assembly, which includes all 500 national
legislators as well as presidential appointees, are also discussing
whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   The unrest in May erupted after military personnel fatally shot
four student protesters. The tumult was fueled by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades.

British foreign secretary denies proclaiming `ethical foreign

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Foreign Secretary Robin Cook wants to make one
thing perfectly clear: He never proclaimed that he wanted Britain
to have an ``ethical foreign policy.''
	   The opposition Conservative Party has repeatedly accused Cook of
failing to live up to his own ``ethical'' standards, most notably
in the case of a British company that supplied arms to Sierra Leone
in violation of an U.N. embargo _ supposedly with the knowledge of
the Foreign Office.
	   But in an interview published in the current issue of the New
Statesman, Cook said he never used the phrase that has been widely
attributed to him.
	   ``I've given up trying to get this across,'' he said. ``I read
in the New Statesman recently that I must regret the day I used the
phrase `ethical foreign policy.' Well, how can I regret it when I
never used it?
	   ``What we have sought to do in a practical way is to put into
effect our values. People see that phrase and see it as
grandstanding.''

	   ROME (AP) _ Rome's latest efforts to open up business to
competition are parked at the curb these days, along with lots of
taxis going nowhere.
	   A bid by the mayor to give taxi customers a little bargaining
power and get more cabs cruising the cobblestones has left the
capital cab-less for much of this fall.
	   After weeks of sporadic one-day strikes, drivers kept their cabs
parked for four straight days through Thursday, when several
thousand taxi drivers from Milan and elsewhere in Italy converged
on the capital and marched in solidarity with their Roman
colleagues downtown.
	   In Venice, passenger-less water taxis filled the lagoon city's
canals to lend morale support. The Venetian taxi drivers are also
striking in their own protest against plans by that city to allow
300 new licenses in time for the 2000 millennium tourist crowd.

Japan's opposition to free-trade pact worries APEC officials
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with APEC discussing possible
compromises regarding free-trade agreement &QL;

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Asian officials criticized
Japan Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' before leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' a South Korean official said in Kuala Lumpur. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit Tuesday and
Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   On Thursday, senior APEC officials began a two-day meeting to
hash out the agenda that Cabinet ministers will approve this
weekend for the summit meeting by the 21 leaders.
	   By the end of the day, the group extended its meetings and
reported some progress in discussing ways to modify the pact in an
effort to break the deadlock.
	   ``We are moving in a positive direction,'' said a New Zealand
official, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``Everyone is still
working for the maximum possible outcome.''
	   Earlier in the day, however, a Japanese official said Tokyo
would not budge. ``Japan won't change its position on the forestry
and fishing sectors,'' he said, also requesting anonymity. ``We
won't compromise, either.''
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has accused Japan
of trying to derail the pact, saying it would fall apart unless the
world's second-largest economy approved all nine sectors.
	   The South Korean official at Thursday's APEC meeting said that
his government supports the free-trade agreement, but could have
trouble selling it back home if Japan refuses to open its fishing
market. South Korea, one of worst victims of the Asian economic
crisis, relies as heavily on fishing as Japan does, and their
fishermen often share the same waters.
	   The official said other countries in the region that support the
pact could end up in arguments over its nine sectors during the
APEC summit, given how much their countries already are suffering
under Asia's 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer warned Thursday that
Japan's approach could unleash protectionist forces.
	   ``I think the threat of slippage with regard to trade worldwide
is very real,'' Fischer said in Canberra, Australia. ``I think that
would be a disastrous course, which would merely extend the present
economic difficulties.''
	   After the APEC summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to
travel to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Just like last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis,
which also has hurt Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   The United States has battled to keep the APEC response to the
crisis on the free-market road that the International Monetary Fund
has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, is expected to lead a counter assault on this free-market
philosophy, arguing that the IMF prescription has failed to halt
the crisis and has instead left many countries in deep recessions
with little prospect of an early recovery.
	   Mahathir would like an endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets, said Abdul Razak Ramli, a Malaysian official who
served as chairman of Thursday's APEC meeting in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``Our prime minister has often lamented about the free flow of
capital and this so-called unbridled movement causing havoc to many
markets, many economies,'' Abdul Razak said in an interview with
Associated Press Television News. ``So I think the fact that we are
championing this ... seems to suggest that it is very much part of
Kuala Lumpur's APEC agenda.''
	   Those two views over free trade are likely to dominate the
discussions during the APEC summit, but are expected to be papered
over before the final statement is issued.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Doubt's remain about Netanyahu visit to Switzerland, official says
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BERN, Switzerland (AP) _ The Swiss government is trying to find
out whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will
personally honor outspoken U.S. critics of Switzerland just a week
before he is to appear here, an official said Thursday.
	   Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Yasmine Chatila refused to confirm
or deny a report that the Swiss government might withdraw
Netanyahu's invitation to a Nov. 25 Swiss-Israeli economic seminar
in Bern.
	   The Swiss are concerned about the Nov. 17 Jerusalem ceremony for
Edgar Bronfman, head of the World Jewish Congress, and former U.S.
Senator Alfonse D'Amato.
	   ``Preparations for the visit continue,'' said Chatila, but she
added that the Swiss Embassy in Israel is trying to pin down
details about the Jerusalem ceremony.
	   Once the embassy reports back, the governing cabinet will decide
how to react.
	   Swiss officials have let it be known they would regard as an
affront Netanyahu's participation in the Jerusalem event.
	   Bronfman and D'Amato are to be honored for their ``courage'' in
pushing through a settlement by Swiss banks of Holocaust victims'
claims.
	   Also to be honored are New York City Comptroller Alan Hevesi,
who threatened Swiss banks with sanctions, and U.S. Undersecretary
of State Stuart Eizenstat, who oversaw the talks that led to the
settlement.
	   The Zurich weekly newsmagazine Facts reported Thursday that
Swiss President Flavio Cotti wants to withdraw Netanyahu's
invitation.
	   Key concerns that the Swiss Embassy in Tel Aviv is pursuing are
whether the ceremony will be an official state event and whether
Netanyahu will personally present the honors, Swiss sources said.
	   Following international pressure, Swiss banks agreed in August
to pay dlrs 1.25 billion to Holocaust survivors to compensate for
World War II losses.
	   In September, a leaked letter Netanyahu wrote praising Bronfman
for his part in the negotiations briefly put in doubt a visit to
Israel by Switzerland's armaments chief and Netanyahu's invitation
to the economic seminar.
	   Netanyahu moved to end the row with a conciliatory statement
saying that Swiss-Israeli friendship was solid.
	   The Swiss government remains angry with Bronfman for what it
considers were unfair attacks and in particular for remarks earlier
this year about ``total war'' on the Swiss.
	   	   D'Amato, who lost his New York reelection bid earlier this
month, used his former chairmanship of the Senate Banking Committee
repeatedly to attack Swiss banks for their handling of the assets
of people killed in the Nazi Holocaust.
	   Sigi Feigel, a prominent Swiss Jewish leader, earlier this month
issued an open letter calling on Netanyahu to explain the honors.

After ratifying peace accord, Israel poised to build in Jerusalem

end of next week, Palestinians conducting exercise at their airport
ahead of next week's opening &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ A day after ratifying the land-for-security
agreement with the Palestinians, Israel announced Thursday it would
begin construction of a large Jewish neighborhood in a part of
Jerusalem claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital.
	   Palestinian negotiators denounced the construction plans, as
well as a decision by Israel's Cabinet to attach a series of
conditions to the peace accord it ratified Wednesday evening.
	   The Palestinians are now looking to U.S. Mideast peace envoy
Dennis Ross for help. The emissary is coming to the region Friday.
	   ``It is now crucial to have the American side join us ... to
oversee implementation of the agreement,'' said Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. ``We will not accept any post-agreement
negotiations.''
	   Still, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat was pleased when Israel
approved the accord after two weeks of delay. Arafat broke into a
huge smile and gave a thumbs up when his aides told him of the
Cabinet vote, said Jerusalem Post editor Jeff Barak who was
attending a briefing with Arafat at the time.
	   Despite Thursday's new friction, there were signs of
preparations for implementation. Israel is to withdraw gradually
from 13 percent of the West Bank by the end of January, in exchange
for a Palestinian crackdown on Islamic militants.
	   At the Palestinian airfield in the Gaza Strip that is to open
next week, Israeli and Palestinian officials on Thursday practiced
checking arriving passengers, using dozens of volunteers. Israeli
officials watched as Palestinians checked luggage and passports.
	   In the West Bank, three tanks on flatbed trucks rolled out of a
base near the Palestinian town of Dura. The army refused comment
when asked whether the base was one of those to be dismantled.
	   In a first stage, Israel is to withdraw from 2 percent of the
West Bank on Monday. However, Israeli officials said the withdrawal
would be delayed until the end of next week.
	   The accord is vehemently opposed by several Cabinet ministers,
coalition legislators and some of Netanyahu's key constituents,
including Jewish settlers. In a sign of the deep divisions in the
government, the accord was approved by only eight of 17 Cabinet
ministers, with four opposed. Five ministers, all members of
Netanyahu's Likud Party, abstained.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of settlers staged a protest rally, with
many speakers calling for Netanyahu's ouster.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism, the government on Thursday
published bids for the construction of 1,025 homes in what is to be
a large Jewish neighborhood, Har Homa, in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem. Eventually, 6,500 apartments are to be built in Har
Homa, known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi warned of serious consequences if
construction actually begins. In March 1997, when Israel broke
ground for Har Homa, the Palestinians suspended all contacts with
Israel. ``This is an obvious violation of the agreement, a
one-sided step whose implementation will bring a serious response,
as we saw in the past,'' Tibi said.
	   In ratifying the agreement, the Cabinet threatened to annex
parts of the West Bank if Arafat carries out a plan to declare
independence on May 4, the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   In his meeting with Barak and other Israeli journalists, Arafat
signaled he was not seeking a confrontation. ``May 4 is the end of
the five-year period we agreed upon in Oslo. If there are other
ideas, I'm ready to listen,'' Arafat was quoted as saying.
	   The Palestinian leader also appeared ready to go toward the
Israelis on another issues, the procedure for annulling clauses of
the PLO founding charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   The Palestinians maintain that the Palestine National Council
accomplished the task in a vote in April 1996. However, Netanyahu
says they didn't complete the job.
	   As part of the Wye agreement, the PNC and other Palestinian
groups are to meet by mid-December to ``reaffirm'' a letter from
Arafat to U.S. President Bill Clinton in which he lists the clauses
considered annulled.
	   Israel stipulated Wednesday that the clauses could only be
revoked by a formal vote of the PNC, while the Palestinians have
maintained that approval by acclamation was sufficient.
	   ``Has the Knesset ever voted twice on an issue?'' Arafat asked
rhetorically when asked by the Israeli reporters about the PNC
vote. However, he added: ``If it is necessary, we will do it.''
	   The PNC meeting is to take place just ahead of Israel's main
pullback. Netanyahu promised the ministers that the Cabinet will
meet before each stage of withdrawal to vote on whether the
Palestinians were meeting their obligations.

US team offers to train Pakistanis to protect nuclear technology
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Fearful of a nuclear technology leak,
the United States offered Thursday to train Pakistanis in customs
and export controls, Pakistan's foreign ministry said.
	   The offer came at the end of two days of talks between Pakistan
_ a new nuclear power _ and U.S. officials over the pitfalls of
being a nuclear state, particularly the danger that the technology
could be shared.
	   According to a foreign ministry statement the U.S. team, led by
Deputy Assistant Secretary of State John Barker, offered
``assistance in training in customs and export control areas.''
	   The U.S. team arrived in Pakistan from neighboring India, which
also declared itself a nuclear state after conducting underground
nuclear tests last May. Pakistan followed with tests of its own.
	   The tests generated an international outcry as well as fears of
a possible nuclear confrontation on the volatile Asian
subcontinent, which has seen three wars between India and Pakistan
in the past 51 years.
	   The two countries narrowly averted a fourth, possibly nuclear
confrontation, in 1990.
	   Two wars have been over the disputed Himalayan state of Kashmir
that is divided between the two countries and claimed by both.
	   After exploding their nuclear weapons both countries declared
themselves nuclear states.
	   Both India and Pakistan have promised not to share their nuclear
technology.
	   ``Pakistan remains committed not to export sensitive materials
and technologies to third countries and on this score its record is
impeccable,'' said the foreign ministry statement.

Israeli ambassador protests Communist's anti-Semitic attacks
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The Israeli ambassador on Thursday strongly
condemned a recent spate of anti-Semitic attacks by a Communist
lawmaker, saying they were an insult to the entire Israeli nation.
	   Ambassador Zvi Magen made the remarks after meeting with
Communist Party leader Gennady Zyuganov to protest attacks by
Communist lawmaker Albert Makashov. He said Zyuganov denounced the
remarks and promised to do everything possible to condemn such
actions.
	   ``These remarks are an insult and a challenge to the entire
nation,'' Magen said after the meeting, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   Several prominent Russian businessmen and politicians have
called for banning the Communist Party because it would not censure
Makashov for anti-Semitic remarks.
	   In speeches last month, Makashov, a retired general, blamed the
country's problems on ``zhidy'' or ``yids,'' a slur against Jews.
	   Makashov was at it again Wednesday, telling a Russian journalist
with the NTV television station he was ``acting worse than the
worst of the yids.''
	   Makashov also told the Italian newspaper La Stampa that he wants
quotas introduced on the number of Jews in Russia's state
organizations.
	   Zyuganov initially tried to smooth over the harshest of
Makashov's earlier attacks and refused to comment on the call for
quotas.
	   After meeting with the ambassador Thursday, Zyuganov said the
Communist Party ``has always condemned attacks on any nationality.
Russo-phobia, anti-Semitism and insults to any people living in
Russia are unacceptable,'' he was quoted as saying by Interfax.
	   But he added that ``the careless and insulting remarks made on
the spur of the moment must not be multiplied and proliferated by
the mass media to fuel a fire in a country which resembles a forest
drenched in gasoline,'' the agency said.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution last week
condemning Makashov's comments, and several of his Communist
colleagues defended him in speeches last weekend celebrating the
81st anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, which brought the
Communist Party to power.
	   Several leading politicians and business people have said the
incident showed the party was fascist and have called for the
Communists to be banned.
	   President Boris Yeltsin condemned the Communist Party for its
stance on Makashov, but Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov strongly
opposed the calls for a ban on the party.

South Africa concerned over citizen held hostage in Nigeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The South African government on
Thursday expressed concern about the fate of a South African
citizen and seven others held hostage in Nigeria.
	   The eight petroleum company employees were abducted on Wednesday
in the oil producing region near Warri, in the Niger Delta in
southeastern Nigeria, a statement from the foreign affairs office
said.
	   ``This region has in recent times become volatile as local
ethnic groups pursue their campaign for increased revenues from the
Nigerian Government and multinational petroleum companies operating
in the region,'' the statement said.
	   South African officials in the Nigerian capital of Lagos are in
close contact with the company and the government, the statement
said.
	   The name of the company was not known.

<TEXT>
	   PORT SAID, Egypt (AP) _ Five U.S. Navy warships, including an
aircraft carrier and a submarine, will cross the Suez Canal next
week on their way to the Gulf, canal officials said Thursday.
	   The Navy ships will reach Egypt on Nov. 20 and pass the canal
the next day to join the U.S. naval force preparing to launch
military strikes on Iraq from the Gulf.
	   The carrier, USS Enterprise, is leading the group comprising the
submarine, USS Miami, a missile launcher, a destroyer and a supply
ship, Suez Canal officials said. They spoke on condition of
anonymity.
	   There are already 23,400 U.S. troops in the Gulf in addition to
174 aircraft, 21 ships and nine vessels armed with Tomahawks,
according to the Pentagon.
	   The planned military strikes are to retaliate for Iraq's Oct. 31
decision freezing cooperation with the U.N. weapons inspectors in
charge of destroying its weapons of mass destruction.

Family doctor now faces six charges of murder
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASHTON-UNDER-LYNE, England (AP) _ A doctor already accused of
killing four of his female patients to gain their money appeared in
court Thursday to be charged with two more deaths.
	   Authorities said they are investigating the deaths of 22 more of
Dr. Harold Shipman's patients.
	   The family doctor from the northern England town of Hyde,
Greater Manchester, had been charged with murder in the first four
deaths in September after police exhumed the women's bodies.
	   The first charge involves the death of 81-year-old widow
Kathleen Grundy. Shipman, 52, is accused of falsely obtaining cash
and property worth 300,000 pounds (dlrs 500,000) from her estate
and forging a will and two letters.
	   A total of nine bodies have been exhumed so far. Detectives want
to exhume the body of a 10th woman in her native Malta, but her
family has refused.
	   All of the women died between December 1997 and June 1998,
authorities said.

Divers should recover bodies of 1994 ferry disaster, panel says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LENNART SIMONSSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Divers should try to recover as many
bodies as possible from the Baltic Sea ferry Estonia that sank in
1994, killing 852 people, a government-appointed panel recommended
Thursday.
	   Then prime minister Ingvar Carlsson promised that four years
ago, but the next government decided to leave the 757 missing
bodies buried at sea. That much-criticized policy now may be
reversed.
	   The wreck lies about 54 meters (180 feet) below the sea surface,
some 100 kilometers (62 miles) south of the Finnish port of Turku.
The ferry was traveling at night under very heavy seas from
Tallinn, Estonia, to Stockholm.
	   Only 137 people survived and 95 bodies were recovered and
identified. The government planned to entomb the boat under tons of
sand, concrete and rocks to prevent plundering, but many victims'
relatives demanded the bodies be recovered or the entombment money
used for compensation.
	   The estimated cost of entombment was 350 million kronor (dlrs 52
million).
	   The panel, chaired by Peter Oern, secretary-general of the
Swedish Red Cross, was set up to investigate how civil authorities
responded to the Sept. 28, 1994, disaster. It also aimed to restore
public trust in them.
	   ``We believe that many relatives can't complete their mourning
without efforts to recover their loved ones,'' Oern was quoted as
saying Thursday by the national news agency TT.
	   Lennart Berglund, whose mother- and father-in-law died in the
sinking, said ``This is a great relief. We have waited four years
for this.''	   
	   Berglund, chairman of the Foundation for Estonia Victims and
Relatives, spoke on Swedish national TV.

Colombia's Herrera takes first-round lead
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GOTEMBA, Japan (AP) _ Eduardo Herrera of Colombia, calling
himself lucky on fast greens, shot a 7-under-par 65 Thursday and
took a two-stroke first-round lead in the 150 million yen (dlrs 1.2
million) Sumitomo VISA Taiheiyo Masters.
	   Japanese golfers Ryoken Kawagishi and Nobuo Serisawa both shot
67s.
	   ``I was lucky my ball found the hole,'' said Herrera, who shot
eight birdies and one bogey. ``The greens are so fast you can hit a
good putt and still three-putt. At least they were slower than on
Tuesday. I guess they didn't cut them as low today.''
	   Herrera has won four times since joining the Japan tour in 1987,
including once this season.
	   Frankie Minoza of the Philippines, also seeking his second
victory this season, shot 68 and was tied with Roger Mackay of
Australia and two Japanese _ Shinichi Yokota and Tateo ``Jet''
Ozaki.
	   Lee Westwood of England, seeking his third consecutive victory
in this tournament, shot a 72 on the 7,072-yard, par-72 Taiheiyo
Masters Gotemba course.
	   ``I played poorly, putted worse,'' said Westwood. ``I'm
delighted I shot level par.''
	   To do that, Westwood birdied the par-5 18th, even though his
second shot landed in a pond short of the green. The ball was
sitting on sand, half out of the water, and Westwood hit a wedge
within 2 feet (less than a meter) from the hole.
	   He was tied for 36th with Jose-maria Olazabal of Spain, Yeh
Chang-ting and Chen Tze-chung of Taiwan and six Japanese, including
Naomichi ``Joe'' Ozaki, youngest of the three Ozaki brothers.
	   Mark O'Meara, this years Masters and British Open champion, shot
73 and shared 46th with fellow Americans Jeff Slumen and Todd
Hamilton, Zaw Moe of Myanmar and nine Japanese, including veteran
Tsuneyuki Nakajima.
	   A total of 84 players, including 23 non-Japanese, teed off in
clear weather.
	   The winner will collect 27 million yen (dlrs 221,000).

Europe's new central bank won't deliberately challenge the dollar,
</HEADLINE>
president says &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: EMBARGOED until 1730 GMT, time set by source &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ European Central Bank President Wim
Duisenberg says the bank won't challenge the dollar's international
dominance with its new currency, according to an advance copy of
speech to be delivered later Friday in New York.
	   ``There will be no deliberate policy of challenging the U.S.
dollar,'' according to the remarks to be delivered at the Economic
Club. The ECB ``will accept the international role of the euro as
it develops through market forces.''
	   Still, Duisenberg asserted in the speech that the euro, which
launches Jan. 1 in 11 of 15 European Union states, will be a major
world currency, representing an economic zone that ``will roughly
equal the United States in terms of both its economic strength and
the volume of its external trade.''
	   And the ECB ``will have an important international role to
play,'' Duisenberg said, noting that one-fourth of the world's
currency reserves are held in currencies that will merge into the
euro.
	   ``I could well imagine that many central banks in the world
will, ultimately, hold at least an appropriate proportion in
euro,'' Duisenberg said.
	   Moreover, the proportion of global share portfolios held in
European Union currencies was growing rapidly _ between 1981 and
1995 it had risen from 13 to 37 percent, while the dollar's share
had fallen from 67 to 40 percent, Duisenberg said.
	   ``I would expect the introduction of the euro to lead to a
continuation of this trend, and even potentially to accelerate
it,'' Duisenberg said, adding that the unified currency will create
``a deep and liquid European money market which will ensure a
common overnight rate.''
	   In longer-term investments, market integration will be
``jump-started'' by the redenomination on Jan. 1 of outstanding
government debt in the euro, he said.
	   From Jan. 1, the ECB will set monetary policy for the euro zone,
operating a single interest rate.
	   The project is ambitious, and has recently appeared challenged
by a political shift in Europe, where center-right governments have
been replaced by center-left administrations intent on getting
people back to work _ a move which finance leaders in Germany have
said may necessitate increased government spending.
	   Duisenberg appealed for restraint, or ``sound budgetary policies
and responsible wage behavior,'' warning looser fiscal policy would
imperil Europe's stability pact _ an agreement among the euro-zone
nations to cut government deficits and, if possible, run surpluses.
	   Increased spending could imperil the ECB's central task _ to
keep inflation low and prices stable, Duisenberg said.
	   The ECB would likely gain observer status at the International
Monetary Fund, Duisenberg noted, barred by IMF rules that only
countries can be members.
	   Duisenberg also pledged the ECB, which sometimes has been
criticized as unaccountable due to its transnational status, would
be transparent.
	   It would publish monthly bulletins and annual reports, give
regular speeches and interviews to explain policies, and present
its policies to the European Parliament four times a year, as well
as holding monthly news conferences, he said.

Greenpeace: Nuclear reprocessing plant emits radioactive carbon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The environmental watchdog group Greenpeace claimed
Thursday that the French nuclear reprocessing plant at La Hague
emits ``worrisome'' levels of radioactive carbon.
	   Greenpeace said an analysis of grass and leaves surrounding the
plant showed concentrations of carbon-14 that are two to seven
times greater than normal levels.
	   ``It is clear that the entire area surrounding La Hague,
especially the part downwind from the plant, is seriously
contaminated by radioactive carbon,'' Greenpeace said in a
statement.
	   Officials at Cogema, the state nuclear fuel reprocessing
company, said they could not immediately comment because they had
not yet seen the report.
	   Carbon-14 is absorbed by plants, animals and humans, which can't
differentiate between stable carbon and the radioactive isotope,
Greenpeace said.
	   Earlier this week, Greenpeace said the La Hague plant was
emitting high levels of aerial radiation.
	   Spent fuel from the French nuclear power plants, as well as
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Japan are
reprocessed at La Hague, which is operated by COGEMA.

<TEXT>
	   MOSTAR, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ An explosion in an area
dominated by hard-line Croats opposed to Muslim returns damaged a
house and injured a Muslim, police officials reported Thursday.
	   Police identified the victim as Mujo Djurjan and said the
explosion occurred late Wednesday in the village of Borojevici,
near Stolac. They said Djurjan's condition was stable.
	   Since the start of the year, 70 explosions or other incidents
directed against non-Croat refugees trying to return to homes the
fled during the Bosnian war have been registered in the Stolac
area, 115 kilometers (72 miles) southwest of Sarajevo. No arrests
have been made.

17 reported killed in new massacre
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ Armed men massacred 17 people in an
attack early Thursday south of Algiers, authorities said. The
attackers slit the throats of the victims -- mainly women and
children, according to hospital sources.
	   Interior Minister Mustapha Benmansour visited the massacre site
at Moussa Abderahmane, in the Ain Defla region some 100 kilometers
(60 miles) southwest of Algiers, a brief statement by authorities
said.
	   It provided no details on the attack, which occurred in a
rugged, forested region where Islamic insurgents are thought to be
hiding out.
	   There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the attack,
the bloodiest reported in recent months.
	   Such attacks are blamed by authorities on the Armed Islamic
Group, the radical insurgency movement trying to topple this North
African nation's military-backed government.
	   Sources at Ain Defla Hospital, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that five women and eight children were among the
victims -- all of whom had their throats slit.
	   The attack occurred less than six weeks before the start of the
Muslim holy month of Ramadan -- marked by a surge in violence since
the start of the insurgency in 1992.
	   The insurgency was triggered by the army decision to cancel
legislative elections that a now-banned Muslim fundamentalist party
was poised to win.
	   An estimated 75,000 people -- civilians, soldiers and insurgents
-- have been killed in the violence.

expiration &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SAARBRUECKEN, Germany (AP) _ German Finance Minister Oskar
Lafontaine has been recommended to succeed Jacques Santer as the
next European Commission president, German media reported Thursday.
	   A Social Democratic European parliamentarian, Klaus Haensch,
told Saarlaendischer Rundfunk radio that he is promoting Lafontaine
as a candidate for the post. ``It's Germany's turn to occupy this
post,'' Haensch said. A German last held the commission presidency
from 1958-67.
	   Germany already has sought French support for a German
candidate, the weekly Die Zeit reported in its latest edition
issued Thursday.
	   In Brussels, European Commission spokeswoman Martine Reichert
declined to comment on the report that Lafontaine would succeed
Jacques Santer. The Santer commission's five-year term expires at
the end of 1999.
	   Under EU rules, the commission president is selected by the 15
EU governments, each of which has the right to put forward a
candidate, and their choice must be ratified by the European
Parliament.
	   Lafontaine already has substantial influence in the new Social
Democratic-led German government, occupying both the party's top
post and running the Finance Ministry as Germany joins 10 other
European countries in the monetary union launching Jan. 1.

Dutch crew struggles to contain spill from burning freighter
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING to fix coding &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEL, Germany (AP) _ A Dutch crew worked Thursday to contain an
oil spill from a burning freighter abandoned off the German coast
in the North Sea during storms two weeks ago. More than 1,000 birds
have died in the spill, and another 15,000 are covered with oil.
	   The spill, some 4 kilometers (2.5 miles) long and 80 meters (87
yards) wide, has already reached the beaches of two German islands,
Sylt and Amrum, but officials said that heavy rain was helping to
rinse the oil back to sea.
	   The rain also lessened fears that the spill would endanger
seals. One animal, covered in oil, was shot and killed yesterday,
but wildlife officials no longer expect a major threat to the
region's seal population, most of which is farther north this time
of year.
	   A platform was being sent from the Netherlands to pump 600 tons
of oil still on board the freighter ``Pallas,'' where fires still
smoldered two weeks after it capsized in stormy seas and the crew
abandoned ship.
	   Heavy storms at the time prevented firefighting crews from
boarding the freighter, or rescue vessels from getting close enough
to disembark the crew, forcing them to jump overboard.
	   The 147-meter (482 foot) freighter, abandoned off the Danish
coast, has since drifted closer to Germany, despite attempts to
anchor it.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot officers fired plastic bullets,
tear gas and water cannons Thursday at thousands of students near
Parliament during the biggest day of protests so far against a
government assembly on political reform.
	   Students hurled rocks, bottles and bamboo sticks at police who
chased and beat them with canes. Five protesters were injured by
plastic bullets and at least one policeman was hurt, state-run
radio said. At least three demonstrators were arrested.
	   The nighttime violence in central Jakarta showed the depth of
divisions over Indonesia's transition to democracy after 32 years
of authoritarian rule, with students pressing for sweeping change
and the government urging a gradual approach.
	   The student rallies turned violent after vastly outnumbered
police and soldiers failed to hold back marchers, many chanting
``Let us through'' and waving red and white Indonesian flags.
	   On two main roads near Parliament, students scattered as
officers fired shots but later regrouped. Security forces had been
ordered to carry blanks and plastic bullets.
	   Up to 20,000 people had tried to march to Parliament, where the
nation's highest legislative body met to craft rules for 1999
parliamentary elections. Students accuse the 1,000-member People's
Consultative Assembly of trying to hinder reforms.
	   Fearing violence, banks, shops and offices had closed their
doors and sent workers home early. Streets in the usually
traffic-clogged, tropical capital were clear.
	   The mood recalled deadly riots in May that shook Jakarta and
helped oust former President Suharto, a former army general who
rose to power in the 1960s.
	   This week, several protests have ended in violence pitting
students against riot police and military-backed civilian guards.
	   In a move likely to further anger students, government leaders
said that general elections were likely to be delayed until July,
two months later than President B.J. Habibie had promised.
	   Marzuki Darusman, a leader of the ruling Golkar party, cited
tie-ups in drafting electoral laws.
	   Activists are skeptical that assembly delegates are willing to
shake off their legacy as Suharto proteges and implement democratic
reforms.
	   Convening in the green-domed legislative building, delegates
debated whether to escalate an investigation of Suharto, who is
accused of human rights abuses and enriching his family at state
expense.
	   An investigation of Suharto's business holdings is under way,
but government prosecutors say they have found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
	   Students say the government, which is filled with former Suharto
loyalists, is too compromised by its links to the former president
to properly investigate him.
	   Earlier, as students in brightly colored university jackets made
their way to Parliament, they shouted slogans including, ``Habibie
must step down and Suharto must take responsibility.''
	   Thousands of people stood by, watching the marchers and
occasionally clapping and cheering. The students took a circuitous
route along main roads, some in densely populated poor areas.
	   ``We will keep on protesting if our demands are not fulfilled,''
said demonstrator Lufti.
	   Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on duty in the capital this
week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day assembly meeting Tuesday.
Critics suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president
next year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the assembly, which includes all 500 national
legislators as well as presidential appointees, are also discussing
whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   The unrest in May erupted after military personnel fatally shot
four student protesters. The tumult was fueled by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades.

Danish goalkeeper reported on way out at Man United
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Manchester United called a news
conference Thursday amid reports that Danish goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel was leaving the club.
	   BBC Greater Manchester Radio reported that Schmeichel, who has
made more than 300 appearances for United, will leave Old Trafford
for a French club at the end of the season.
	   Both Marseille and Monaco have been linked with the 34-year-old
Danish international.
	   Schmeichel's position at United has been increasingly questioned
this season because of his age, injuries and crucial blunders.
	   The Dane's mistake in the last minute of United's Champions
League game against Bayern Munich in September cost the club a
victory.
	   Schmeichel, who turns 35 next week, has also been dogged by
injuries recently and has missed two games this season with back
trouble.
	   United has been reportedly searching for a successor to
Schmeichel and has been consistently linked with Aston Villa's
Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich.
	   Schmeichel is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the
world and has been a hugely influential figure in United's success
in the 1990s.
	   He has helped the club win four Premier League titles, two FA
Cups and the League Cup. Last February against Derby, he became the
first goalkeeper to register 100 shutouts in the Premiership.
	   Schmeichel was the starting 'keeper for Denmark during the World

Rwanda to increase taxes, cut spending in 1999 budget
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIGALI, Rwanda (AP) _ Recognizing Rwanda no longer can count on
foreign donors to prop up its budget, the government proposed
raising gas and alcohol taxes, and increasing coffee production to
meet its 1999 budget.
	   The proposed budget is 98.9 billion Rwandan francs (dlrs 329
million), an 8 percent increase over last year's spending, Finance
Minister Donald Kaberuka said Wednesday.
	   Parliament has until Jan. 31 to consider the budget proposal.
	   If approved, Kaberuka said spending for the health and education
will increase slightly help combat the spread of AIDS, and to
provide free universal primary education until 2005. Public
salaries will go up, too, while tax evaders can expect to be
punished, he said.
	   The tiny Central African nation, impoverished by a 1994 genocide
and continuing Hutu insurgency, will have a 16.1 billion Rwandan
franc (dlrs 53 million) budget shortfall next year, and must find
its own resources to fill the gap left by disinterested donors,
Kaberuka said.
	   ``International generosity is over. Aid levels, which reached
their peak in the last four years, are now falling. The little that
remains has become unpredictable, and comes with too many
conditions attached,'' he said.
	   Despite the government's good performance in reducing inflation,
cutting public spending and raising tax revenues, foreign donors
have failed to honor their commitments and created a dlrs
20-million shortfall in last year's budget, Kaberuka said.
	   Earlier this year, Rwanda signed a three-year loan facility with
the International Monetary Fund, and entered negotiations on a
67-percent reduction of its dlrs 1.2 billion external debt, pending
the success of economic reforms.
	   Donors have set up a dlrs 41.7 million fund to help Rwanda
service the remainder of its debt.
	   The last year's budget of 80.3 billion Rwandan francs (dlrs
314.5 million) relied heavily on foreign aid.
	   In addition, the European Union, World Bank, African Development
Bank and bilateral donors financed 93 percent of the country's 71.7
billion Rwandan franc (dlrs 239 million) development budget, meant
to eradicate poverty and stabilize economy.
	   In 1998, the total value of exports has been estimated at dlrs
82.1 million, while imports were expected to total dlrs 326
million.
	   Kaberuka said the trade deficit will be overcome by boosting
coffee and tea production, Rwanda's main source of revenue.
	   Coffee production for this year was expected to hit 15,000 tons,
but fell short at 13,000 tons. In addition, the 37-percent drop in
international coffee prices with more declines possible forced the
government to remove a 16-percent coffee export tax to improve
yields and quality, Kaberuka said.
	   He said immediate targets of the 1999 budget will be to keep
inflation below 5 percent; maintain growth of the gross domestic
product at 7.6 percent; reduce the budget deficit; raise tax
revenues from 10 percent to 11.7 percent of gross domestic product;
and maintain foreign exchange reserves equivalent to 5.5 months of
imports.
	   Despite battling Hutu rebels in northwestern Rwanda and
deploying troops in neighboring Congo, defense spending will remain
below 30 percent of the budget, Kaberuka said.

Journalists, photographers protest against military at Parliament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-Politics &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Hundreds of photographers and
reporters covering a special session of the Indonesian People's
Consultative Assembly protested against the military Thursday after
three colleagues were beaten by troops.
	   About 300 people joined the protest on the stairs leading to the
main hall of the Parliament building.
	   They waved banners reading, ``Stop violence against
journalists'' and ``Respect the rights of journalists.''
	   They demanded that Armed Forces Commander Gen. Wiranto apologize
to the press at large rather than only to the beaten photographers.
	   The beatings in Central Jakarta occurred after a car carrying
protesting students plowed into a group of riot officers, injuring
nine and prompting enraged soldiers to fire shots and lash out with
clubs. Several protesters also were injured.
	   Of the three injured photographers, one, from the official
Antara news agency, was still in a hospital Thursday.
	   A statement signed by 320 local and foreign journalists,
photographers and cameramen asked for security guarantees from the
military.
	   ``Otherwise we will boycott news from this assembly's session as
well as from (the military) from now on,'' some protesters said.
	   Taufik, a reporter for the newspaper Kompas, described the
incident as ``serious harassment of our profession as
journalists.''
	   Marzuki Darusman, chairman of the ruling Golkar party, met the
protesters and joined in signing their statement.
	   ``Today, we formally submit our complaint to the National Human
Rights Commission,'' a reporter told Darusman, who also is vice
chairman of that government-established watchdog body.
	   More than 120 photographers and students staged a similar
protest in the East Java capital of Surabaya.
	   The protests just came after Wiranto had apologized to the
victims.
	   The four-star army general also promised to take measures
against troops who have deviated from procedures in performing
their duty.

Sampras' No. 1 in doubt; Hanover will decide final No. 1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MONTE CARLO, Monaco (AP) _ Pete Sampras' No. 1 ranking is in
doubt, with Chile's Marcelo Rios poised to retake the spot.
	   Sampras' first-round defeat Wednesday to Jason Stoltenberg in
the Stockholm Open means that Rios can reclaim No. 1 if he wins
this week's Chevrolet Cup in Santiago, Chile. He also could do it
by simply reaching the final.
	   Sampras is seeking to finish the season at No. 1 for the sixth
straight year. That would break the record of Jimmy Connors, who
finished at No. 1 five consecutive years.
	   To move up to No. 1, Rios needs to reach the Santiago final and
pick up 24 bonus points, which are awarded depending on the
strength of his opponents.
	   No matter who holds the top spot when the new ATP Tour rankings
come out Monday, the race for No. 1 will be settled at the Nov.
24-29 ATP World Championship in Hanover, Germany.
	   There are no ATP Tour singles events next week.
	   Six players have already qualified for the dlrs 3.5 million
Hanover event: Sampras, Rios, Andre Agassi, Carlos Moya, Alex
Corretja and Karol Kucera.
	   Three players are in the running for the final two spots:
Russia's Yevgency Kafelnikov and Britain's Tim Henman and Greg
Rusedski.

	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Roy Evans was expected to step down as
co-manager of Liverpool on Thursday, leaving Frenchman Gerard
Houllier in sole charge of the struggling Premier League club.
	   British newspapers reported that Evans, who has been with
Liverpool for 33 years as a player, coach and manager, reached a
settlement to leave the club in a meeting Wednesday night with
chairman David Moores.
	   Liverpool called a news conference for 2:30 p.m. (1430 GMT)
Thursday at which the club was expected to annouce that Evans was
leaving by ``mutual consent.''

Egyptian man's hand cut off for stealing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities chopped off the
right hand of an Egyptian man Thursday for stealing at Islam's
holiest site in Mecca, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded.
	   The SPA said Sharif Ali Ibrahim was convicted of pick pocketing
worshipers praying in the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal
point of Muslim prayers.
	   Ibrahim's hand was cut off with a sword in the holy city of
Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, the agency said.
	   This was the fifth amputation this year. Over the past few
months, two Saudis, an Egyptian and an Afghan man had their right
hands cut off for pick pocketing in the same mosque.
	   Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword in a
public square.
	   So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 22 people. Last year
124 people were executed.

Nagano Olympic organizers to compensate fan who missed event
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A court has ordered organizers of the Nagano Winter
Olympics to compensate a fan who missed a ski jumping event because
his shuttle bus arrived late, an official said Thursday.
	   The plaintiff, a 38-year-old university employee, sued the
Nagano Olympic Organizing Committee after the official shuttle bus
he had boarded reached the venue after the last athlete had jumped.
	   The Urawa Summary Court rule that the committee's transport
preparations had been insufficient, and ordered it to pay 13,560
yen (dlrs 110), which included the plaintiff's train fare to the
games, said court official Minoru Koike.
	   The committee already had reimbursed the man from Urawa, just
north of Tokyo, for admission to the event and the shuttle bus
fare. The court did not release the plaintiff's name.
	   The presiding judge ruled that the committee was obligated to
compensate the man for the ``mental grief'' he suffered from
missing the event, Kyodo News reported.
	   Olympic organizers were harshly criticized after traffic and
transport glitches caused scores of fans to miss events during the
Feb. 7-22 games.

Ribbeck recalls five, names striker Zickler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German coach Erich Ribbeck on Thursday
recalled veterans Lothar Matthaeus and Andreas Moeller and named a
rookie striker, Alexander Zickler of Bayern Munich, for next week's
exhibition game against the Netherlands.
	   Matthaeus, 37, missed Germany's opening two qualifying games for
the 2000 European Championship last month against Turkey and
Moldova because of an injury.
	   Ribbeck, who took over after Berti Vogts' resignation in
September, had promised to recall the veteran Bayern Munich
sweeper, who has a record 129 appearances for Germany.
	   Moeller, 31, retired from the national team after the World Cup
but made himself available when Ribbeck became the new coach. He
did not travel to Turkey and Moldova, however.
	   Germany got off to a rocky start in its defense of the European
title, losing 1-0 to Turkey but beating Moldova 3-1.
	   Although Wednesday's match against the Netherlands in
Gelsenkirchen is an exhibition, games between the neighboring
rivals can often become hostile emotionally charged showdowns.
	   The Netherlands reached the semifinals at this summer's World
Cup in France and lost the third-place match to Croatia, which had
ousted Germany in the quarterfinals.
	   Ribbeck invited seven players from the Bundesliga leader Bayern
Munich, including Zickler, who scored in a 2-1 victory over
Barcelona in the Champions League last week and then followed up
with a goal in the Bundesliga over the weekend in a 3-1 defeat of
local rival 1860 Munich.
	   Coming back from injury or suspension are midfielder Thomas
Strunz of Bayern Munich, midfielder Dietmar Hamann of Newcastle
United and defender Christian Woerns of Paris Saint-Germain.
	   --- &QC; 
	   The roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich), Stefan Klos (Borussia
Dortmund), Jens Lehmann (AC Milan).
	   Defenders: Markus Babbel (Bayern Munich), Lothar Matthaeus
(Bayern Munich), Jens Nowotny (Bayer Leverkusen), Marko Rehmer
(Hansa Rostock), Christian Woerns (Paris Saint-Germain).
	   Midfielders: Mario Basler (Bayern Munich), Stefan Beinlich
(Bayer Leverkusen), Dietmar Hamann (Newcastle United), Joerg
Heinrich (Fiorentina), Jens Jeremies (Bayern Munich), Andreas
Moeller (Borussia Dortmund), Carsten Ramelow (Bayer Leverkusen),
Lars Ricken (Borussia Dortmund), Thomas Strunz (Bayern Munich).
	   Forwards: Oliver Bierhoff (AC Milan), Ulf Kirsten (Bayer
Leverkusen), Olaf Marschall (FC Kaiserslautern), Oliver Neuville
(Hansa Rostock), Alexander Zickler (Bayern Munich).

Report: Two technology advisers to Malaysia quit over Anwar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Malaysia Anwar Trial

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two international advisers to
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's ambitious high-technology project
have quit, protesting the treatment of his former deputy, a
magazine reported Thursday.
	   Alvin Toffler and Kenichi Ohmae, two leading technology authors,
resigned from the international advisory panel of the project known
as the Multimedia Super Corridor, according to an article in the
latest edition of the Far Eastern Economic Review.
	   The magazine said the two sent Mahathir ``sharp letters''
expressing their disappointment over his treatment of his former
deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Mahathir, however, scoffed at the article, according to the
government news agency, Bernama.
	   ``I don't know about Alvin Toffler but I certainly know about
Kenichi. He has not resigned,'' the prime minister said. He added
that any resignation of panel members would not harm the MSC.
	   Mahathir envisions the MSC as a means to push his Southeast
Asian nation into the vanguard of the Information Age. He has vowed
the project will be launched despite the country's economic
turmoil.
	   Anwar is currently on trial for corruption and sexual
misconduct, charges he has denied and called politically motivated.
	   World leaders and others voiced outrage when Anwar appeared in
court in September with a black eye he said came from police
beatings.
	   Toffler, a former MSC supporter, wrote a scathing article in an
international newspaper recently saying he doubted the project
could succeed. He said he was skeptical that the world's leading
technology companies would bring the digital future to a country
that he said was still under authoritarian rule.
	   ``The Internet cannot deliver its full economic and cultural
benefits in a climate of political fear,'' Toffler wrote.
	   Toffler, who is an American author, and Ohmae, an expert from
Japan, were part of an MSC advisory panel that included 41 of the
biggest names in information technology.
	   Toffler has published bestsellers including ``Future Shock'' and
``Third Wave.'' Ohmae, an old acquaintance of Mahathir's, is the
author of ``The Borderless World.''

Lebanese woman detained for smuggling 334 mobile phones
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ Customs officers at Beirut airport have
detained a Lebanese woman for trying to smuggle 334 cellular phones
into the country, police said Thursday.
	   The woman, 41, identified only as H.S, was arrested by airport
police soon after arriving from London Wednesday night.
	   Another man, identified as W.G., also was detained for suspicion
of being an accomplice, police said, speaking on customary
condition of anonymity.
	   The seized Nokia and Ericsson phones were hidden in three
suitcases, which the woman claimed contained clothes.
	   According to receipts seized from the woman, the value of the
phones was estimated at dlrs 52,500, police said.
	   Demand for cellular phones is high in Lebanon because land
telephone lines were badly damaged in the 1975-90 civil war and are
still being repaired.
	   According to a report published last year, about 7.5 percent of
Lebanon's 3.2 million residents own cellular telephones.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Prosecutors wrapped up their appeal Thursday of a
court ruling allowing Gen. Augusto Pinochet immunity from
prosecution in Britain, arguing that the crimes against humanity he
is charged with ``unequivocally'' violate international law.
	   But an attorney for the former Chilean dictator reiterated to a
five-judge tribunal in the House of Lords, Britain's highest court,
that any acts committed by Pinochet were ``in exercise of
governmental power'' and thereby immune from prosecution.
	   At the conclusion of the six-day hearing, Lord Justice Gordon
Slynn gave no indication when the tribunal would rule in what he
called ``this important and very difficult case.''
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish extradition
warrant citing charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping during
his 17-year-rule, which began in 1973 when he toppled Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   But England's High Court quashed the arrest, saying Britain's
1978 State Immunity Act granted him immunity from arrest here as a
former foreign head of state.
	   A report by Chile's government says some 3,000 people were
murdered or disappeared at the hands of secret police under
Pinochet. Chile, however, has protested his arrest, saying it
strains the country's democracy, carefully built since the general
stepped down in 1990.
	   Christopher Greenwood, an attorney representing the Spanish
government and Spanish and British prosecutors, argued Thursday
that Pinochet has no right to immunity and that Britain has no
obligation to Chile to allow him to return home.
	   ``Torture, hostage-taking and crimes against humanity are
conduct which international law has forbidden unequivocally
throughout the period that we are looking at,'' Greenwood said.
	   Because of the importance of the case and the legal precedent it
may set, the judges had called in international expert David
Lloyd-Jones to give an independent opinion as a so-called ``friend
of the court.''
	   ``It is essentially a question of interpretation,'' Lloyd-Jones
told the court Wednesday. He noted that a strict reading of
Britain's immunity act might give protection from arrest for acts
that were ``part of some state policy, however terrible that policy
might be.''
	   With placards declaring ``Pinochet must pay,'' and ``Wanted:
Augusto Pinochet'' a group of some 50 protesters demonstrated daily
outside the House of Lords, part of the elegant Houses of
Parliament and a prime area for tourists.
	   Pinochet, arrested while recuperating from back surgery, remains
in a north London hospital under police guard.
	   On Wednesday, Clive Nicholls, a lawyer for Pinochet, said the
1978 act was so broad that even Adolf Hitler could not be tried in
this country.
	   Pinochet's lawyers maintain that if he is to be tried, the right
place is Chile _ where he has so far enjoyed immunity partly
because of laws he introduced _ or before an international
tribunal, such as the ones set up specially to try war crimes and
mass murder in Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia.

Tajikistan accused Uzbekistan of training, aiding rebels
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ELKHOM NARDIEV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DUSHANBE, Tajikistan (AP) _ President Emomali Rakhmonov on
Thursday accused neighboring Uzbekistan of training Tajik rebels
and aiding in their recent anti-government raids.
	   The allegations came in the wake of several days of fighting in
this Central Asian nation. The rebels were defeated and chased into
northern mountainous regions, near the border with Uzbekistan.
	   The Tajik government had originally insisted that the border was
closed and the rebels could not escape.
	   But Thursday, Rakhmonov said that the rebels had not only fled
into Uzbekistan, but had been receiving training and assistance
there for this and previous anti-government raids.
	   ``It is an aggression on the part of a neighboring state,''
Rakhmonov told parliament Thursday. ``Uzbekistan has been
interfering in our internal affairs for six years now. We have
enough facts and proof to appeal to international organizations.''
	   The former Soviet republics in Central Asia _ Tajikistan,
Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan, Kazakstan and Turkmenistan _ generally
enjoy good relations, and the dispute marks are rare public
disagreement between regional leaders.
	   Rakhmonov accused the Uzbek secret services of training Tajik
rebels and aiding their anti-government raids during the past few
years. Tajik officials claimed to have evidence, but none has been
released.
	   Uzbekistan has firmly denied the allegations.
	   But the Tajik Foreign Ministry called the denials a
``intentional attempt to misinform the world community about the
true state of affairs,'' according to a statement released
Thursday.
	   Also on Thursday, the Tajik parliament unanimously adopted an
appeal to the United Nations, the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe, Russian President Boris Yeltsin and other
leaders and organizations, asking them to ``condemn the attempted
state coup on Nov. 4-9, launched from the territory of
Uzbekistan.''
	   Rakhmonov and parliament also said Uzbekistan was harboring two
suspected rebel leaders _ former Prime Minister Abdumalik
Abduladzhanov and former army Col. Makhmud Khudoberdyev.
	   Khudoberdyev, who broke with the government after it signed a
peace treaty with the opposition last year, had demanded that
Rakhmonov free all political prisoners and bring his supporters
into the government.
	   The peace treaty has ended five years of civil war between the
mostly Islamic opposition and Rakhmonov's hard-line government.
	   The main opposition groups are now participating in the
government, but a number of warlords have refused to acknowledge
the peace accord and periodically launch attacks in the poor,
mountainous republic.
	   Tajikistan officials said Thursday that 120 people were killed
during the fighting, and more than 600 injured, the ITAR-Tass news
agency reported.

Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Arafat comment, color from gas mask distribution
center; adds byline &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI-
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army opened gas mask distribution
centers Thursday in preparation for a possible attack by Iraq,
though a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
the probability of Israel being targeted was ``close to zero.''
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, urged the United States to exhaust
the diplomatic option. ``I hope and urge that there will not be an
attack against Iraq,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The
Jerusalem Post. ``Peace in the Middle East will be negatively
affected by a U.S. attack.''
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with top ministers
Thursday to discuss Israeli preparedness for a possible U.S. strike
that might trigger an Iraqi attack on Israel.
	   ``We feel that the chances of any kind of attack are ... close
to zero, but as long as there is any possibility at all, we have to
be prepared,'' said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   On Thursday, the army opened 65 gas mask distribution centers
around the country, the army spokesman's office said.
	   The number will gradually be increased to 150 centers that will
be open 24 hours a day. About 25 percent of Israelis do not have
gas masks or have outdated ones, Israel radio said.
	   Israel first began distributing gas masks to its citizens in the
months leading up to the Gulf War, following threats by Saddam to
attack Israel with chemical weapons.
	   Since the war, Israelis have from time to time exchanged their
gas masks for newer models with fresh filters.
	   A distribution center in a school in the Kiryat Moshe
neighborhood of Jerusalem was almost empty.
	   ``My daughter persuaded me to go,'' said Ariel Schindler, 83, as
he prepared to go inside. Schindler said that during the 1991 war,
he mostly ignored instructions to remain in tightly sealed rooms
during missile attacks. ``Last time, during the (1991) bombings, I
went outside and had a cup of tea,'' he said.
	   In the courtyard of the school, a soldier, cigarette in hand,
chided people for waiting so long to exchange their outdated masks.
	   The U.S. State Department issued an advisory Wednesday
suggesting employees in non-essential positions in Kuwait, Israel
and the Palestinian areas leave the region. However, U.S. officials
said they did not expect more than two dozen Americans to leave,
out of several hundred posted in the Middle East.
	   In the Red Sea resort of Elat, hundreds of British tourists
prepared for their departure Thursday evening. One tour operator,
Thompson, sent four planes to fly out 600 tourists. The company
said it did not want its customers exposed to unnecessary risk.

Japan's opposition to free-trade pact worries APEC officials

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Asian officials criticized
Japan Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' before leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' a South Korean official said in Kuala Lumpur. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit Tuesday and
Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   On Thursday, senior APEC officials began a two-day meeting to
hash out the agenda that Cabinet ministers will approve this
weekend for the summit meeting by the 21 leaders.
	   The group met well into the night and reported some progress in
discussing ways to modify the pact to break the deadlock.
	   A senior U.S. official said they discussed the possibility of
extending deadlines for Japan and other countries to liberalize the
two contentious sectors.
	   ``There's a lot of discussion of flexibility,'' said the
official, speaking on condition that he not be identified. But he
said Washington isn't willing to permit Japan to refuse
liberalizing its fishing and forestry sectors altogether.
	   Earlier in the day, a Japanese official said Tokyo would not
budge. ``Japan won't change its position on the forestry and
fishing sectors,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``We won't compromise, either.''
	   Japan confirmed Thursday that it was working on a plan to help
Asian nations develop their fishing and forestry industries. But a
Japanese delegate said the aid was in no way aimed at winning
support from Asian nations for Japan's insistence on retaining its
fishery and forestry tariffs.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has accused Japan
of trying to derail the pact, saying it would fall apart unless the
world's second-largest economy approved all nine sectors.
	   The South Korean APEC delegate said his government supports the
free-trade agreement, but could have trouble selling it back home
if Japan refuses to open its fishing market. South Korea, one of
worst victims of the Asian economic crisis, relies as heavily on
fishing as Japan does, and their fishermen often share the same
waters.
	   The official said other countries in the region that support the
pact could end up in arguments over its nine sectors during the
APEC summit, given how much their countries already are suffering
under Asia's 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer warned Thursday that
Japan's approach could unleash protectionist forces.
	   ``I think the threat of slippage with regard to trade worldwide
is very real,'' Fischer said in Canberra, Australia. ``I think that
would be a disastrous course, which would merely extend the present
economic difficulties.''
	   After the APEC summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to
travel to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Just like last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis,
which also has hurt Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   The United States has battled to keep the APEC response to the
crisis on the free-market road that the International Monetary Fund
has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, is expected to lead a counter assault on this free-market
philosophy, arguing that the IMF prescription has failed to halt
the crisis and has instead left many countries in deep recessions
with little prospect of an early recovery.
	   Mahathir would like an endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets.
	   ``We hope we'll decide what needs to be done on currency
trading,'' Mahathir told reporters Thursday.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Portuguese university students strike against education fee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Most of the country's 250,000 university
students stayed away from classes Thursday in a one-day strike that
was their latest protest against a law raising fees for higher
education.
	   The action was part of ongoing opposition to a law stipulating
that students at public and private universities must pay a flat
rate of 56,700 Portuguese escudos (dlrs 330) per year as a
contribution towards the cost of higher education.
	   Many students see as the law as the first step towards scrapping
state-funded higher education.
	   Not all students joined the action. Some students said they
disagreed with the form of protest because they would miss exams
scheduled for Thursday.
	   Students previously paid a token annual fee of up to 1,200
escudos (dlrs 7) towards education costs, with the state providing
most of the funding for universities.
	   Many students have refused to pay the latest fee, even though
the law came into force last September at the start of the
education year.
	   So far, no punitive measures have been taken against students
who have not paid the fee.
	   The Socialist party came to power in 1995 pledging changes to
improve all levels of education.
	   Efforts by the previous Social Democratic government to raise
the students' contribution met with fierce opposition and caused
the resignation of two education ministers between 1992 and 1995.

EU launches WTO panel vs Canada over drug patent rules
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission called for
World Trade Organization mediation Thursday in a dispute with
Canada for allegedly failing to provide adequate patent protection
for pharmaceutical products.
	   In a statement, the commission said Canadian patent legislation
violated a WTO agreement covering pharmaceutical inventions.
	   Two rounds of EU-Canada consultations have remained fruitless,
it said, adding, ``Therefore the European Union is seeking a
solution under he WTO Dispute Settlement Mechanism.''
	   European pharmaceutical companies claim losses caused by
Canada's inadequate patent protection amount to hundreds of
millions of dollars a year.
	   Total sales of EU-origin drug products in Canada last year
totaled dlrs 435 million (670 million Canadian dollars), according
to EU estimates.

Police fire plastic bullets and tear gas to break up student

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot officers fired plastic bullets,
tear gas and water cannons Thursday at thousands of students during
the biggest day of protests so far against a government assembly on
political reform.
	   Students fought back, hurling bottles and chunks of concrete at
police in helmets who chased and beat them with canes. Adding to
the nighttime chaos in central Jakarta, military-backed civilian
guards flailed with sharpened bamboo sticks at bystanders.
	   At least 31 injured students were taken to hospitals, more than
half of them in critical condition with plastic bullet wounds. One
policeman was hurt, state-run radio said.
	   The violence showed the divisions that Indonesia faces as it
edges toward democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule, with
students pressing for sweeping change and the government urging a
slower pace.
	   The student rallies turned violent after vastly outnumbered
police and soldiers failed to hold back marchers, many chanting
``Let us through'' and waving red and white Indonesian flags.
	   On two main roads near Parliament, students scattered as
officers fired shots but later regrouped. Security forces had been
ordered to carry blanks and plastic bullets.
	   Up to 20,000 people had tried to march to Parliament, where the
nation's highest legislative body met to craft rules for 1999
parliamentary elections. Students accuse the 1,000-member People's
Consultative Assembly of trying to hinder reforms.
	   Fearing violence, banks, shops and offices had closed their
doors and sent workers home early. Streets in the usually
traffic-clogged, tropical capital were clear.
	   The mood recalled deadly riots in May that shook Jakarta and
helped oust former President Suharto, a former army general who
rose to power in the 1960s.
	   This week, several protests have ended in violence pitting
students against riot police and civilian guards hired to safeguard
the assembly.
	   In a move likely to further anger students, government leaders
said that general elections were likely to be delayed until July,
two months later than President B.J. Habibie had promised.
	   Marzuki Darusman, a leader of the ruling Golkar party, cited
tie-ups in drafting electoral laws.
	   Activists are skeptical that assembly delegates are willing to
shake off their legacy as Suharto proteges and implement democratic
reforms.
	   Convening in the green-domed legislative building, delegates
debated whether to escalate an investigation of Suharto, who is
accused of human rights abuses and enriching his family at state
expense.
	   An investigation of Suharto's business holdings is under way,
but government prosecutors say they have found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
	   Students say the government, which is filled with former Suharto
loyalists, is too compromised by its links to the former president
to properly investigate him.
	   Earlier, as students in brightly colored university jackets made
their way to Parliament, they shouted slogans including, ``Habibie
must step down and Suharto must take responsibility.''
	   Thousands of people stood by, watching the marchers and
occasionally clapping and cheering. The students took a circuitous
route along main roads, some in densely populated poor areas.
	   ``We will keep on protesting if our demands are not fulfilled,''
said demonstrator Lufti.
	   Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on duty in the capital this
week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day assembly meeting Tuesday.
Critics suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president
next year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the assembly, which includes all 500 national
legislators as well as presidential appointees, are also discussing
whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   The unrest in May erupted after military personnel fatally shot
four student protesters. The tumult was fueled by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades.

Schroeder feels chill wind over plans for German economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Opposition leaders condemned the economic
plans of Germany's new center-left government Thursday, predicting
job losses and higher inflation.
	   Two days after Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder stressed in his
inaugural address that lowering unemployment was the goal of his
four-year term, conservative political foes called his recipe
wrong-headed.
	   The Christian Democrats, unseated in September elections after
16 years in power, accused the government of planning an old-style
leftist ``big spending spree'' that would hurt Europe's biggest
economy by pumping up prices.
	   Economics Minister Werner Mueller rejected the criticism,
stressing government plans to slash corporate taxes.
	   ``The government will do everything to keep the German economy
internationally competitive,'' said Mueller, considered a close
Schroeder ally.
	   The exchange during the new parliament's first economic policy
debate came amid complaints by economists, business and leading
German media that Schroeder had failed to get off to a bold start.
	   Labor unions, however, have generally welcomed Schroeder's
initiatives, such as undoing modest cuts in the social safety net
by his predecessor Helmut Kohl and creating jobs by offering
workers retirement at 60 with full benefits.
	   In parliament, the Christian Democrats' economics spokesman,
Matthias Wissmann, ridiculed Schroeder's idea for early retirement,
saying it would bring ``only additional costs.''
	   All signs point to the risk of higher inflation, he said:
Schroeder's tax cut aimed at giving middle-income Germans more
spending money in a bid to spur the economy as well as
administration pressure on central bankers to lower interest rates.
	   The Social Democratic-led government ``is a danger for the
upswing and jobs,'' Wissmann said.
	   Doubts were also raised Thursday about whether the government
will be able to afford all its spending plans.
	   Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine said that next year's budget
gap would be 10 billion marks (dlrs 6 billion) bigger than had been
calculated by Kohl's government. He said the shortfall would double
by 2002.
	   Lafontaine predicted an economic slowdown in 1999, citing lower
domestic demand and Asia's financial crisis.

Yugoslavia names team for Ireland; mobile phones banned
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia on Thursday named its
20-man squad for Wednesday's European Championship qualifying match
with Ireland at Belgrade's Red Star stadium.
	   Scheduled for Oct. 10, the match was postponed because of the
crisis in Kosovo province and the threat of NATO air strikes.
	   The main question mark was the inclusion of third-team
goalkeeper Sasa Ilic. His English Premier League team Charlton has
refused to release him until after Saturday's league match.
	   Coach Milan Zivadinovic is also reported to have banned his
players from using mobile phones, a move to boost their
concentration.
	   ``I want my players to be able to concentrate 100 percent,'' he
was quoted as saying.
	   About 1,000 visas issued to the Irish team and fans have
expired. But the Yugoslav Soccer Association said it hoped the
authorities would show leniency and prolong the visas.
	   Major changes include the dropping of injured Kristijan
Djordjevic and Perica Ognjenovic, and the return of Vladimir
Jugovic. Also included is 26-year-old Djordje Tomic, making his
debut.
	   The team:
	   Ivica Kralj (Porto), Nikola Damjanac (Partizan), Sasa Ilic
(Charlton), Goran Djorovic (Celta), Sinisa Mihajlovic (Lazio),
Mitroslav Djukic (Valencia), Nisa Saveljic (Bordeaux), Slobodan
Komljenovic (Duisburg), Slavisa Jokanovic (Tenerife), Dragan
Stojkovic (Nagoya), Vladimir Jugovic (Atletico Madrid), Dejan
Stankovic (Lazio), Jovan Stankovic (Mallorca), Ljubinko Drulovic
(Porto), Nenad Grozdic (Obilic), Djordje Tomic (Partizan), Predrag
Mijatovic (Real Madrid), Savo Milosevic (Real Zaragosa), Darko
Kovacevic (Real Sociedad), Sasa Kovacevic (Obilic).

Kosovo Albanians reported arrested, threatened
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with comments by Walker on abduction, confirmation by
Serbian sources; other details. Trims.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb police detained 20 Albanians on
Thursday and warned them they would be ``liquidated'' unless two
Serbs apparently abducted by separatist guerrillas were released, a
Kosovo Albanian organization said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of the main
Albanian political party in the Serbian province, said the 20 were
taken off a bus coming from Montenegro.
	   The bus was detained near the border to Montenegro, which makes
up Yugoslavia along with Serbia, said the center, adding that the
two Serbs went missing on Wednesday in the central Drenica region.
	   Serb sources confirmed the abduction but said some of those
taken had been released. Kosovo Albanian sources _ who like the
Serbs did not want to be named _ said 10 people remained detained.
	   William Walker, the American heading a still-forming
international team of Kosovo monitors said his people would ``take
appropriate steps'' after finding out exact circumstances of the
abductions.
	   The Kosovo Information Center is close to Ibrahim Rugova, the
U.S.-supported leader of Kosovo's majority Albanians.
	   Rugova's camp is at odds with supporters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas. Both factions want Kosovo's
independence from Serbia. But Rugova opposes the KLA's armed
struggle and is prepared to settle for a return of autonomy for
Kosovo, as outlined in a U.S.-sponsored plan accepted Oct. 12 by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic under the threat of NATO air
strikes.
	   On Thursday, a pro-KLA Kosovo Albanian political coalition
warned Rugova against plans to organized a predominantly Albanian
police force for the province as foreseen by the October agreement.
	   The coalition said that the KLA was already policing Albanian
areas of Kosovo and ``statements about forming another police force
... would lead to factionalization'' of Kosovo's Albanian entity.
	   In reality, the pro and anti-Rugova factions are already deeply
split. Earlier this week, Adem Demaci, the guerillas' spokesman,
bluntly warned Rugova to butt out of organizing police, saying that
was the KLA's business. And he said the time had passed for any
attempts to paper over differences with Rugova.
	   Even if Serb authorities cooperate, Kosovo Albanian differences
could sour internationally backed attempts to implement the October
plan and start the process of Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   The U.S. envoy to Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
the October agreement was taking shape, ``but we have a long way to
go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet Walker, said he would be going to
Belgrade on Friday to meet authorities there on implementation of
the autonomy plan.
	   Walker pledged a ``robust effort'' on the part of what will be a
2,000-strong monitoring team of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to check on authorities' pledges to scale
back troops and other provisions of the October agreement.
	   British Ambassador Brian Donnely said 50 verifiers will be based
in the southern town of Prizren by the coming weekend, adding he
hoped they would be operation by the early part of next week.
	   In the Netherlands, meanwhile, the U.N. war crimes tribunal said
that investigations of alleged war crimes in Kosovo during the
nearly eight-month crackdown would continue, despite obstruction by
Serbian authorities.
	   Chief tribunal prosecutor Louise Arbour canceled a trip to
Serbia last week after authorities refused to grant her a visa that
would permit her to visit Kosovo. The Hague-based tribunal
maintains that it has the U.N. Security Council's blessing to
investigate alleged atrocities committed during the nearly
eight-month crackdown by the Yugoslav army and Serb police that
left hundreds dead _ mostly Albanian civilians _ and hundreds of
thousands of others homeless.
	   After meeting a Kosovo Albanian delegation Wednesday, ``the
prosecutor indicated that she intends to continue her investigation
notwithstanding the recent hiccups with the visas,'' said Deputy
Prosecutor Graham Blewitt.
	   Kosovo's violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
the province.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   Police accuse the rebels of attacking to try to provoke a harsh
response that could prompt world leaders to order military strikes.

Swiss challenger prepares third attempt at global record

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and his new
teammate, British flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they
will be ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop
round the world.
	   Their new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon will take off from Chateau
d'Oex, in the Swiss Alps, as soon after Nov. 25 as weather
conditions are favorable, they said.
	   It will be Piccard's third attempt to become the first to pilot
a balloon around the world.
	   In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer
Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for
the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar,
also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes.
	   The balloon's round-the-world bid was abandoned after China
refused it entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed
to speed it over the Pacific.
	   But the team has already received conditional permission from
China for this attempt, flight director Alan Noble told a news
conference in Geneva.
	   This will be the last flight sponsored by Swiss watchmaker
Breitling, he added.
	   The balloon's route should take it across the Mediterranean Sea,
Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China and Japan before crossing the
Pacific and North America and returning to Europe, a three-week
journey of some 26,700 kilometers (16,600 miles).
	   Piccard said he believed the two men would work well together in
the cramped conditions of the balloon's cabin.
	   ``We are very different. There will be Tony, there will be me,
and there will be both of us together,'' he said.
	   Two of the Breitling team's challengers, Virgin boss Richard
Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve Fossett, are joining forces
for their own latest attempt.
	   In August, Fossett broke his own distance record, traveling more
than 24,461 kilometers (15,200 miles) before a storm damaged his
balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.

Danish goalkeeper to quit Man United at end of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with announcement

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Veteran Danish goalkeeper Danish
goalkeeper will quit Manchester United and English soccer at the
end of the season, the club announced Thursday.
	   ``Peter Schmeichel is to retire from English football at the end
of the football season,'' the club said in a statement released at
an Old Trafford news conference.
	   BBC Greater Manchester Radio reported that Schmeichel, who has
made more than 300 appearances for United since joining the club in
1991, will probably join a French club next season.
	   Both Marseille and Monaco have been linked with the 34-year-old
Danish international.
	   Schmeichel's position at United has been increasingly questioned
this season because of his age, injuries and crucial blunders.
	   The Dane's mistake in the last minute of United's Champions
League game against Bayern Munich in September cost the club a
victory.
	   Schmeichel, who turns 35 next week, has also been dogged by
injuries recently and has missed two games this season with back
trouble.
	   United has been reportedly searching for a successor to
Schmeichel and has been consistently linked with Aston Villa's
Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich.
	   Schmeichel is regarded as one of the best goalkeepers in the
world and has been a hugely influential figure in United's success
in the 1990s.
	   He has helped the club win four Premier League titles, two FA
Cups and the League Cup. Last February against Derby, he became the
first goalkeeper to register 100 shutouts in the Premiership.
	   Schmeichel has been been capped a national record 107 times by
Denmkark, three more times than Michael Laudrup. He was the
starting 'keeper for Denmark during the World Cup in France.
	   Schmeichel's current backup at United is 35-year-old Dutch
'keeper Raimond van der Gouw. United's other 'keeper is 20-year-old
Nicky Culkin, who has yet to play a League match for the senior
side.

Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army opened gas mask distribution
centers Thursday in preparation for a possible attack by Iraq,
though a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Israel had a ``close to zero'' chance of being targeted.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, urged the United States to exhaust
the diplomatic option. ``I hope and urge that there will not be an
attack against Iraq,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The
Jerusalem Post. ``Peace in the Middle East will be negatively
affected by a U.S. attack.''
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War, during which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However,
the Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with top ministers
Thursday to discuss Israeli preparedness for a possible U.S. strike
that might trigger an Iraqi attack on Israel.
	   ``We feel that the chances of any kind of attack are ... close
to zero, but as long as there is any possibility at all, we have to
be prepared,'' said Netanyahu adviser David Bar-Illan.
	   On Thursday, the army opened 65 gas mask distribution centers
around the country, the army spokesman's office said.
	   A distribution center in a school in the Kiryat Moshe
neighborhood of Jerusalem was almost empty.
	   ``My daughter persuaded me to go,'' said Ariel Schindler, 83, as
he prepared to go inside. Schindler said that during the 1991 war,
he mostly ignored instructions to remain in tightly sealed rooms
during missile attacks. ``Last time, during the (1991) bombings, I
went outside and had a cup of tea,'' he said.
	   In the courtyard of the school, a soldier, cigarette in hand,
chided people for waiting so long to exchange their outdated masks.
	   The U.S. State Department issued an advisory Wednesday
suggesting employees in nonessential positions in Kuwait, Israel
and the Palestinian areas leave the region. However, U.S. officials
said they did not expect more than two dozen Americans to leave,
out of several hundred posted in the Middle East.

Ribbeck recalls five, names striker Zickler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with security precautions &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German coach Erich Ribbeck on Thursday
recalled veterans Lothar Matthaeus and Andreas Moeller and named a
rookie striker, Alexander Zickler of Bayern Munich, for next week's
exhibition game against the Netherlands.
	   Matthaeus, 37, missed Germany's opening two qualifying games for
the 2000 European Championship last month against Turkey and
Moldova because of an injury.
	   Ribbeck, who took over after Berti Vogts' resignation in
September, had promised to recall the veteran Bayern Munich
sweeper, who has a record 129 appearances for Germany.
	   Moeller, 31, retired from the national team after the World Cup
but made himself available when Ribbeck became the new coach. He
did not travel to Turkey and Moldova, however.
	   Germany got off to a rocky start in its defense of the European
title, losing 1-0 to Turkey but beating Moldova 3-1.
	   Although Wednesday's match against the Netherlands in
Gelsenkirchen is an exhibition, games between the neighboring
rivals can often become hostile, emotionally charged showdowns and
clashes between violent fans from both sides are frequent.
	   More than 1,000 police officers will be responsible for
security, including specially trained Dutch troopers.
	   ``We assume that violence-prone fans will come to
Gelsenkirchen,'' said Ulrich Grzella, the local police chief in
charge of security for the match. ``But we hope that there will be
no escalation.''
	   Officials of the two federations will distribute leaflets urging
fans to remain peaceful.
	   To deter fans from violence, prosecutors and judges will set up
special courts that will prosecute and try all offenders on the
spot.
	   More than 8,000 tickets have been sold in the Netherlands, and
there are still 12,000 tickets available for the 53,000-seat arena.
	   The Netherlands reached the semifinals at this summer's World
Cup in France and lost the third-place match to Croatia, which had
ousted Germany in the quarterfinals.
	   Ribbeck invited seven players from the Bundesliga leader Bayern
Munich, including Zickler, who scored in a 2-1 victory over
Barcelona in the Champions League last week and then followed up
with a goal in the Bundesliga over the weekend in a 3-1 defeat of
local rival 1860 Munich.
	   Coming back from injury or suspension are midfielder Thomas
Strunz of Bayern Munich, midfielder Dietmar Hamann of Newcastle
United and defender Christian Woerns of Paris Saint-Germain.
	   --- &QC; 
	   The roster:
	   Goalkeepers: Oliver Kahn (Bayern Munich), Stefan Klos (Borussia
Dortmund), Jens Lehmann (AC Milan).
	   Defenders: Markus Babbel (Bayern Munich), Lothar Matthaeus
(Bayern Munich), Jens Nowotny (Bayer Leverkusen), Marko Rehmer
(Hansa Rostock), Christian Woerns (Paris Saint-Germain).
	   Midfielders: Mario Basler (Bayern Munich), Stefan Beinlich
(Bayer Leverkusen), Dietmar Hamann (Newcastle United), Joerg
Heinrich (Fiorentina), Jens Jeremies (Bayern Munich), Andreas
Moeller (Borussia Dortmund), Carsten Ramelow (Bayer Leverkusen),
Lars Ricken (Borussia Dortmund), Thomas Strunz (Bayern Munich).
	   Forwards: Oliver Bierhoff (AC Milan), Ulf Kirsten (Bayer

KLM, Schiphol back plans for new airport on North Sea island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport appealed Thursday for a new airport on
a manmade island in the North Sea to allow Schiphol to keep pace
with soaring growth.
	   At a joint press conference, KLM and Schiphol directors said the
island would likely cost 35 to 40 billion guilders (dlrs 18.7 to
21.4 billion) but they revealed no construction plans.
	   KLM's Leo van Wijk and Schiphol's Gerlach Cerfontaine said the
project, jointly funded by the government and the private sector,
should be ready by 2010.
	   The airport and national carrier also urged the government to
allow growth to continue on Schiphol's current site on the
outskirts of Amsterdam.
	   Schiphol will handle a total of 380,000 takeoffs and landings
this year _ 20,000 more than last year _ and says it can grow to a
maximum of 600,000 takeoffs and landings in the future.
	   But the airport, which is striving to become one of Europe's
biggest, believes that it can accommodate up to 900,000 flights per
year in the future if it builds a new island. Previous plans have
called for six runways on the island, which would be linked to the
mainland via an undersea rail tunnel.
	   The Dutch airline pilots' association has expressed concerns
that landings and takeoffs from such an island could be dangerous,
given the fierce offshore crosswinds.
	   KLM's U.S. partner, Northwest Airlines, has said the companies'
alliance is under threat if Schiphol is not allowed to grow.
	   The Dutch government is due to make an announcement before
year's end on the future of aviation in the Netherlands.

Noise of lovesick fish drowns out sonar on Norwegian submarines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian navy's submarine corps has run
into an unexpected problem _ lovesick fish _ during dives off the
nation's coast.
	   Teeming schools of passionate cod, in the midst of a frenzied
mating season, make so much noise that the submarines' sonar can't
hear anything else, making it almost impossible to navigate under
the cold waters of the Norwegian Sea, a defense study said
Thursday.
	   The cod grunt repeatedly to attract potential mates.
	   ``This is the first time we have registered the frequency of
sounds from wild cod,'' researcher Erling Kjellsby was quoted as
telling Norway's largest newspaper, Verdens Gang. ``The noise of
cod looking for partners ruins the listening conditions.''
	   The study by the Norwegian Defense Research Institute said the
fish grunts overload sonar systems, and mask sound waves that sonar
transmits to detect objects underwater.

Major League all-stars beat Japan 2-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ Jamie Moyer pitched a two-hitter over five
innings as a team of U.S. Major League stars beat their Japanese
counterparts 2-0 Thursday after losing two straight games.
	   The victory put the Americans ahead three games to two in their
seven-game exhibition series.
	   Moyer, of the Seattle Mariners, gave up two walks and struck out
three for his second victory against no defeats in the series, and
was named the game's Most Valuable Player.
	   Pitching one inning each, relievers Dan Plesac of the Toronto
Blue Jays, Mike Jackson of the Cleveland Indians, Tom Gordon of the
Boston Red Sox and Trevor Hoffman of the San Diego Padres held the
Japanese to three hits the rest of the way.
	   Playing before a full capacity crowd of 48,000 at Osaka Dome,
the Major Leaguers scored the first run in the third inning on a
sacrifice fly by Andruw Jones of the Atlanta Braves.
	   He brought home Jason Giambi of the Oakland Athletics, who had
doubled and reached third on a grounder by Damion Easley of the
Detroit Tigers.
	   Colorado Rockies player Vinny Castilla brought in the second run
with another sacrifice fly in the ninth after Sammy Sosa of the
Chicago Cubs had doubled and advanced to third on a wild pitch by
Kansei Kobayashi of the Hiroshima Toyo Carp.
	   Sosa, who celebrated his 30th birthday with a cake with Japanese
children at the stadium before the game, went 2-for-4, including a
single in the second inning.
	   The Major Leaguers had 10 hits against three Japanese pitchers,
including eight off Shigeki Noguchi of the Chunichi Dragons, who
led the Central League with a 2.34 earned run average this season.
He was 14-9.
	   However, Major League runners were cut down in five double
plays.
	   Japan mounted a threat in the ninth against Hoffman.
	   With one out, pinch hitter Takanori Suzuki of the Japanese
professional champion Yokohama BayStars, a .337 hitter in the 1998
season, hit an infield hit.
	   Ichiro Suzuki of the Orix BlueWave, who led the Pacific League
with a .358 average, also singled.
	   But Hideki Matsui of the Yomiuri Giants, who hit a two-run home
run in Japan's 6-2 victory in Game 3, lined to second for a double
play.
	   Game 6 in the all-stars series is scheduled at Tokyo Dome
Saturday.

EU seeks to ban 4 antibiotics from animal feed; Reviews 4 others
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission, citing public
health concerns, on Thursday proposed to ban four antibiotics used
in animal feed and added that four additional antibiotics are under
review.
	   EU spokesman Gerard Kiely valued trade in the four products for
which a ban was requested at ``hundreds of millions'' of dollars a
year.
	   If approved, the ban would take effect Jan. 1.
	   The antibiotics are used to boost growth in animals, especially
pigs and poultry. They're also used as human medicines or are
closely related to human medicines.
	   Kiely said the proposal for a ban stemmed from the fear the use
of antibiotics raises human resistance to medicines. He said ``in
the Netherlands the same resistant bacteria have been found in a
poulty farmer and in his poultry.''
	   A ban is bound to be spark strong objections from EU farmers and
the pharmaceutical industry.
	   Eight antibiotics are allowed to be used in the 15 EU nations as
growth promoters in animal feed.
	   Sweden has asked _ and has been granted the right _ to ban all
eight and Finland and Denmark prohibit several.
	   The European Commission is recommending to ban these antibiotics
from feed:
	   Bacitracin Zinc (made by Alpharma AS of Norway); Spiramycin
(made by Rhone-Poulenc SA of France); Virginiamycin (made by Pfizer
Inc. of the United States) and Tylosin phosphate (made by Elanco of
the United States, a unit of Eli Lilly &AMP; Co, also of the United
States).
	   The proposal was put to a panel of animal nutrition experts from
all 15 EU nations. It will vote on the ban, perhaps as late as
December.
	   If a majority of committee members backs the ban, the Commission
can impose it. If not, the measure goes to the EU agriculture
ministers for a decision.
	   Other experts are looking at the health implications of the
other four antibiotics.
	   The ban would not affect imports. ``To our knowledge we do not
import feed containign these antibiotics,'' he told reporters.
	   In the past decade, the EU has banned 15 antibiotics for public
health reasons.

German minister challenges ex-Communists to support constitution
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The successor party to the East German
communists must make clear its support for German democracy before
government surveillance of its members is called off, Germany's
interior minister said Thursday.
	   Otto Schily said he had asked the domestic security agency to
draw up a report on the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS), and
would decide after reading it if the party needed to be regularly
monitored.
	   The party got just above 5 percent of the vote in September's
national elections, making it a full-fledged faction in parliament
for the first time since unification in 1990.
	   The party also recently began governing in coalition in the
eastern state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.
	   Yet it remains under surveillance by the federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution because of its hard-core communist
wing, which is considered to be committed to the overthrow of the
German state.
	   Schily earlier had termed the situation ``awkward,'' because the
party was in government and under surveillance at the same time.
	   On Thursday, he Schily called on the PDS to take an
``unmistakable'' stand on whether it supported Germany's democratic
constitution or still harbored anti-democratic principles.

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday taunted
his foes in the Malaysian government, while his criminal trial was
brimming with tales of the former deputy prime minister's alleged
sexual escapades.
	   At one point, a police witness described how Anwar's former
driver clutched the Koran, the sacred book of Islam, as he swore
that Anwar had sodomized him.
	   The 51-year-old Anwar says he is the victim of a politically
motivated vendetta in this predominantly Muslim nation, which
usually avoids public discussion of politicians' sex lives.
	   Many Malaysians are shocked by the stories they have been
hearing from Anwar's trial on corruption and sexual misconduct
charges.
	   Late Thursday, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad said he expects
Anwar supporters to take to the streets during next week's summit
meeting of 21 Pacific Rim leaders in Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``I'm sure they'll want to demonstrate to show how unstable
Malaysia is,'' Mahathir said sarcastically. ``For them it's a
political issue. They want to make the most of this.''
	   Anwar supporters have taken to the streets in dozens of noisy
protests since his arrest two months ago, though the situation has
been calm in recent days. Police have said they will block any
demonstrations during the summit of the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation group.
	   During a break in Thursday's proceedings, Anwar issued a string
of verbal taunts against the government and his one-time patron,
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, despite a gag order.
	   ``There are two sets of laws, one for me and one for Dr.
Mahathir. They put me in prison and they asked me to shut up. I'm
in prison, so why are they scared?'' Anwar told a group of
reporters in the courthouse hallway.
	   He added: ``There are so many poison pen letters against the
prime minister and (the national police chief). I've seen so many
of them.''
	   Anwar's trial is already expected to drag on well into next
year, but the defendant said that if Mahathir is still in power,
``then it might go beyond the year 2000.''
	   In the courtroom, Judge Augustine Paul barred Mazlan Mohamed
Din, an assistant police commissioner who was on the witness stand,
from reading aloud a lurid account of Anwar's alleged sexual
encounters with his private secretary's wife.
	   ``This evidence is being introduced solely for its prejudicial
value,'' defense attorney Christopher Fernando complained. ``It
certainly has no probative value.''
	   Judge Paul agreed, stipulating that the documents would be
entered into the trial record, but not read aloud in the crowded
courtroom.
	   Mazlan then proceeded to describe how Anwar's former driver,
Azizan Abu Bakar, defended the truthfulness of a letter in which he
described being sodomized by Anwar last year.
	   ``He (Azizan) clasped the Koran, swearing that if he lied he
would be cursed by Allah. He swore that what was contained in the
letter is true,'' Mazlan told the court. ``Since it was a Muslim
who swore using the Koran, I find that convincing.''
	   Anwar supporters seated in the courtroom groaned at the witness'
use of religion to buttress his testimony.
	   Under questioning by the prosecution, Mazlan said Anwar gave
police direct orders to force Azizan and another key witness to
withdraw their allegations of sexual misconduct.
	   Earlier, Mazlan told the court that police tracked down the two
people and found them cowering in the master bedroom of a house
near downtown Kuala Lumpur in August 1997.
	   Members of a crack police unit took several hours to arrest them
because the owner of the house barred police from entering. A
further delay ensued when police found the bedroom door jammed.
	   ``Both targets had to be lowered through the window of the
balcony,'' Mazlan said.
	   The trial will be suspended during next week's summit of Pacific
Rim leaders in Kuala Lumpur, some of whom may be meeting with
Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail. Any such meetings are likely to
infuriate the Malaysian government, which doesn't want the Anwar
case to become a sideshow to the summit talks.
	   Judge Paul has rejected defense attempts to show the former
Malaysian deputy prime minister is the victim of a political
conspiracy and trumped-up charges.
	   Mahathir, 72, has defended his sacking of Anwar as the country's
No. 2 official in September, and said he believed Anwar would
receive a fair trial.

	   --
	   BANGUI, Central African Republic (AP) _ More than 800 Rwandan
refugees have left their northern camp for neighboring Congo, state
television reported.
	   The refugees, both Hutus and Tutsis, had been settled in a camp
near Bonao, 350 kilometers (560 miles) northwest of the capital of
Bangui. They left voluntarily on Wednesday by boat, the broadcast
said, quoting government officials.
	   However, they left following recent government calls for their
expulsion.
	   The Tutsis, who fled Rwanda in 1994 and 1995, had first gone to
Congo _ then known as Zaire _ before heading to the Central African
Republic about two years ago.
	   Home Affairs minister Gen. Francois Dedaya-Djadder last week
called for the expulsion of all Rwandan refugees following the
death of two Sudanese in a Rwandan refugee camp.
	   Relief workers were threatened in the attack, which was
apparently carried out by Sudanese rebels, a U.N. refugee agency
spokesman said.
	   Growing acrimony between the Rwandans and the people of the
Central African Republic have also led to other skirmishes.
	   The departure of the refugees leaves only a handful in the
central African country.
	   -----
	   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast (AP) _ The African Development Fund
approved a loan of dlrs 28.1 million to the Ivory Coast to finance
the second phase of a program to develop the country's human
resources.
	   According to a Development Fund statement on Wednesday, the
program will reinforce the power of education authorities to reform
technical and higher education as well as professional training. A
national policy on occupational medicine is also planned.
	   The total cost of the program is estimated at dlrs 31.1 million.
The loan from the Development Fund, a subsidiary of the African
Development Bank, will finance the program's total foreign currency
costs.
	   -----
	   MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) _ More than 50,000 antipersonnel mines
have been removed from roads and fields since civil war ended in
1992, the National Demining Commission said.
	   Speaking at a two-day seminar on demining on Wednesday, Osoria
Mateus, director of the agency, said that about dlrs 116 million
was spent over the past six years removing unexploded mines and
other ammunition.
	   Land mines have been cleared from 7,337 kilometers (4,500 miles)
of road, 379 kilometers (234 miles) of power lines and 3,500
hectares (8,645 acres) of land, the official said.
	   The mines were planted during the civil war that followed
Independence from Portugal in 1975.
	   ----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ The first South African-built
satellite is scheduled for launch from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California in January, a press agency reported Thursday.
	   Called Sunsat, the satellite will be used in environmental
research and will transmit images of cultivated fields, natural
vegetation and pollution, the South African Press Association
reported.
	   The 63-kilogram (140-pound) satellite was designed and built by
the engineering department at Stellenbosch University, in the
winegrowing region near Cape Town.
	   ``It conveys a very positive message about our present and
future place in the technological world,'' said project leader
Garth Milne.
	   The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration
would launch Sunsat free of charge in exchange for space on the
satellite for its own surveying equipment, the university said.
	   ----
	   MESSINA, South Africa (AP) _ A judge on Thursday dismissed
trespassing charges brought against 192 farm workers after they
joined a trade union.
	   The case represented a victory for the Nkuzi Development
Association, a group that is fighting to protect farm workers from
exploitative pay and living conditions.
	   ``This victory... sends a message to farm owners that the days
of mistreating farm workers are coming to an end,'' said Marc
Wegerif, executive director of the Nkuzi group.
	   After President Nelson Mandela was elected in 1994's first
democratic elections, the government has moved to protect the
rights of farm workers who often have no place to live other than
their workplace.
	   Police arrested the workers and filed the charges after citrus
farmer Andries Fourie complained about their activities on his
farm.
	   Fourie dismissed 300 workers when they joined a trade union in
March and evicted union members from their homes, the Nkuzi group
said. Long-term farm residents were protected from eviction under a
law passed last year.
	   The judge found that state witnesses contradicted each other
during the trial.
	   ----
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ South Africa's Human Rights
Commission plans to investigate charges of racism in news
organizations, the group said Thursday.
	   The probe was sparked by a request from two organizations
representing black lawyers and accountants who alleged that the
weekly Mail and Guardian and the Sunday Times had violated ``the
fundamental rights of black people.''
	   The commission said it would broaden its probe into racism in
all media, because the issue could not be confined to two
publications.

Olympic gymnastics champ turns 100

	   GRAD OTOCEC, Slovenia (AP) _ Six-time gymnastics medalist Leon
Stukelj, the oldest living Olympian, turned 100 in style Thursday
with celebratory events across Slovenia and a visit from the head
of the Olympic movement.
	   Juan Antonio Samaranch, chief of the International Olympic
Committee, was the first guest of honor at Stukelj's birthday gala,
and was to give a speech about him Thursday evening.
	   The old Slovene gymnast, fighting a cold, missed the opening in
his hometown of Maribor of an exhibition of rewards and photos that
he collected through years.
	   But he did appear later in Grad Otocec, a picturesque city on an
island on the Krka river.
	   Later, a ceremony was planned on the main square in Novo Mesto,
where Stukelj was born in 1898. A gala gymnastic event was
scheduled in his honor in the city's sports hall afterward.
	   ``For many more years to come'' is inscribed in the copy of an
ancient Roman glass, one of many birthday presents.
	   Stukelj won Olympic golds in the horizontal bar and all-around
competition at Paris in 1924 and in the rings at Amsterdam in 1928.
He also won two bronze medals at Amsterdam, in the all-around and
team exercises, and a silver in the rings at Berlin in 1936.
	   He was so good that one of his trademark moves is still known as
the Stukelj maneuver.
	   Stukelj went on to work as a judge and also wrote books on
gymnastics. He remains involved in Slovene sports life, and has
kept up his health by working out on rings in his apartment and by
taking hour-long walks in a a nearby park.

Opponents of new Islamic law fear for their lives

<TEXT>
	   ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (AP) _ Telephone calls in the middle of the
night threatening death to anyone opposing a new Islamic law in
Pakistan has frightened dissidents, the leader of a Christian
organization said Thursday.
	   The death threats have been directed at leaders of minority
religious groups as well as human rights and women activists, said
Shahbaz Bhatti, head of the Christian Liberation Front.
	   ``For the last one month I have been receiving calls from people
who say 'I will shoot you' or 'I will teach you a lesson you will
never forget,''' Bhatti said in an interview with The Associated
Press.
	   The groups oppose a constitutional amendment that would impose
Islamic law in Pakistan based on the Muslim holy book the Koran and
the Sunnah, which are the teachings of Islam's prophet Mohammed.
	   On Thursday, Bhatti said he wrote the prime minister letting him
know of the death threats ``because then if anything happens to me
people will know why.''
	   Bhatti said those threatening to kill him say he is an infidel
or non-Muslim ``and therefore I have no right to live.''
	   In his letter to Sharif, Bhatti said that the government is
ignoring the fatwas issued by the country's radical Muslim clerics.
	   The National Assembly passed the amendment, which needs the
approval of the Senate to become law. Sharif does not have enough
support in the Senate to get the amendment passed, but he could try
to slip it through a joint session of the Senate and the National
Assembly.
	   Its critics, including women's rights activists, say they fear
the new law will open the door to a system of government similar to
that of neighboring Afghanistan, where the Taliban religious
militia rule. In Afghanistan, women have been forced off the jobs
and schools for girls closed.
	   Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's government has promised that the
new Islamic law will reflect a moderate interpretation of Islam and
that the rights of the religious minorities and women will be
protected.
	   Opponents say it could also embolden Muslim extremists in
Pakistan, who already have begun to issue fatwas or edicts calling
for the killing of those opposing the bill.
	   Former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and opposition parties have
criticized the new law. A government official called her opposition
a sin.

	   OSAKA, Japan (AP) _ Olympic champion Cuba overpowered China
15-4, 16-14, 15-12 Thursday, keeping its women's world volleyball
championship as well.
	   The title was Cuba's third overall. It first won in 1978 in
Leningrad, ending more than two decades of Soviet and Japanese
domination of the championships.
	   ``The Cuban team absolutely is the world's No. 1,'' said Chinese
coach Lang Ping. ``My team learned a lot from the Cubans, and we'll
reflect the lessons in our training and future competitions.''
	   China, the world champion in 1982 and 1986, gained its second
silver medal. It also was runner-up in Beijing in 1990, when the
then Soviet Union won the gold and the United States took the
bronze.
	   Speedy and powerful Cuba needed only 15 minutes to win the first
set, with Regla Bell McKenzie, Regla Torres Herrera and Ana
Fernandez Valle leading in serves, blocks, spikes and defense.
	   China, the Asian champion and Olympic silver medalist, rallied
in the second set, tying the Cubans 10 times through 14. Then it
lost two key points, one by not playing a serve that the Chinese
thought would be out.
	   The Chinese, led by Qiu Aihua, Sun Yue and Wu Yongmei, went
ahead 12-7 in the final set before the Cubans rallied for eight
straight points and the championship.
	   ``I just can't predict how many more times these Cuban women can
keep the major world titles,'' said head coach Antonio Perdomo.
``Winning a title is easier than keeping it.''
	   In the match for third place, Russia overcame a slow start and
beat 1996 Olympic bronze medalist Brazil 13-15, 15-6, 15-11, 15-13.
	   Natalia Morozova's serves led Russia to an 8-1 first-set lead,
but the Brazilians tied it at 12 and went on to win, helped by the
attacking, blocking and retrieving of Ana Moser.
	   The Russians won the next two sets by tightening their defense,
blocking Moser, and diversifying their attacking patterns.
	   In the final set, Moser managed to lead Brazil to a 12-4 lead,
but that was as far as her tired team could go.
	   ``After the '96 Atlanta Olympic Games, I've changed the
composition of the team and young players joined,'' Russian coach
Nikolai Karpol said. ``I'm satisfied with that third place with a
young team.''
	   In the game for fifth place, Italy outclassed Croatia 15-7,
15-10, 15-8, gaining its best place ever in a world championship.
Italy's best previous finish was ninth place.
	   Anna Vania Mello led the Italians with eight points, followed by
Elisa Galastri's seven and Francesca Piccinini's six.
	   Italian team captain Maurizia Cacciatori said she was just happy
to place fifth with a squad of many young and new players, which
was organized in preparation for the 2000 Olympics. Ten of the 18
Italian players are 21 or younger. The team's average age is 21.8.
	   For seventh place, the Netherlands outclassed host Japan 15-12,
3-15, 15-10, 15-8.
	   ``After losing the match against Brazil, we lost our rhythm,''
said Japanese coach Nobuhiko Kuzuwa. ``We failed to change our
mentality and mood. We couldn't show our best performance.''
	   The men's world championship starts Friday and ends Nov. 29 in
Japan.

Arsenal legend returns to Highbury with more than points at stake
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHN PYE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ George Graham, one of Arsenal's most successful
managers, returns to Highbury on Saturday. But as manager of
archrival London club Tottenham, he won't expect a hero's welcome.
	   For Graham, there's more than Premier League points at stake in
this eagerly awaited north London derby after his acrimonious
departure from Highbury three years ago.
	   After steering the Gunners to league titles in 1989 and '91, the
FA Cup in 1993, the League Cup in 1987 and 1993 and the European
Cup Winners' Cup in '94, Graham was dumped by the Arsenal board in
1995 when he was accused of financial wrong-doing in a player
transfer.
	   The Football Association later found Graham guilty of the
charges and he served a one-year ban from soccer before renewing
his management career at Leeds in late 1996.
	   He took Leeds to fifth place in the Premier League and a berth
in the UEFA Cup before returning to London in September to replace
deposed Tottenham manager Christian Gross at White Hart Lane.
	   He has reversed Spurs' poor early season form, steering his new
charges to a 3-1 League Cup win over Liverpool on Tuesday and a
berth in the Cup quarterfinals.
	   Graham says his reputation has been restored after two good
years at Leeds and, despite the fact he still has support among
Gunners fans, he has a point to prove.
	   ``Arsenal is a huge part of my past, a past full of good
memories. But those recollections are locked away now. My public
life is devoted to Tottenham absolutely 100 percent,'' he said.
	   ``The North London derby is always highly charged and (the
players) will be up even more for this one.''
	   Arsenal goes into Saturday's match on the back of its worst home
defeat in 73 years after a second-string Gunners side was thrashed
5-0 by Chelsea in Wednesday's League Cup match.
	   Arsenal, the defending F.A. Cup and League double titlist, is
currently No.2 in the league standings but French coach Arsene
Wenger is under extreme pressure against Tottenham.
	   Key striker Dennis Bergkamp and veteran defender Tony Adams are
under injury clouds _ although Bergkamp indicated Thursday he wants
to play against Tottenham _ and Wednesday's loss did little to
instill confidence into their prospective replacements.
	   However, Wenger said the Chelsea debacle should be put into
perspective.
	   ``It's not a disaster,'' he said. ``It's just a good lesson for
them (young players),'' he said.
	   Gerard Houllier was expected to be in sole charge of Liverpool
against Leeds at Anfield on Saturday after Roy Evans was squeezed
out of the ill-fated management partnership Thursday.
	   The former French national coach, who joined Liverpool as Evans'
co-coach in the summer, will be attempting to restore some pride
into the Reds after two successive home defeats.
	   Evan's departure after five years at the helm was almost
inevitable after Tuesday's 3-1 league cup loss to Tottenham. That
loss followed Saturday's shock 2-1 loss to Derby.
	   Houllier will have to start without his biggest attacking asset,
with 18-year-old England striker Michael Owen expected to be
sidelined for up to a month with a hamstring injury.
	   To add to his problems, international winger Steve McManaman has
also been ruled out for six weeks with an achilles injury.
	   Liverpool started the season in spectacular form, igniting hopes
of a return to the glory days of the 1970s and '80s, but the Reds
have since slumped into the bottom half of the standings.
	   New Leeds coach David O'Leary goes into the Anfield clash
desperate for his team to improve on Wednesday's 2-1 League Cup
loss to Leicester.
	   Manchester United will be aiming for its fifth win in seven
matches Saturday when the Red Devils take on struggling Blackburn
at Old Trafford.
	   United, unbeaten at home this season and currently No. 3 in the
standings, scored a 2-1 win over Nottingham Forest in Wednesday's
league cup fourth-round clash and advance to a quarterfinal match
with Tottenham.
	   The player depth at Alex Ferguson's disposal was apparent when
his shadow squad dominated Forest, with Ole Gunnar Solskjaer
scoring twice.
	   In Saturday's other London derby, fifth-placed Chelsea takes on
Wimbledon at Stamford Bridge in a rehearsal for their League Cup
quarterfinal in December.
	   The Blues outclassed Arsenal on Wednesday, with player-manager
Gianluca Vialli scoring two goals, while Wimbledon scored a 2-1 win
over Bolton to advance.
	   In other Premier League matches Saturday, League leader Aston
Villa is expected to win maximum points against last-placed
Southampton, Charlton hosts Middlesbrough, Newcastle takes on
Sheffield Wednesday and West Ham plays Leicester.
	   On Sunday, Coventry will be attempting to overhaul Everton with
a win in the only Premier League match of the day.
	   Derby, surprise winners over Liverpool last Saturday, will play
Nottingham Forest in the remaining Premier League match on Monday.
	   In Division One matches Saturday, leaders Sunderland, which
advanced to the League Cup quarterfinals Wednesday after beating
Everton 5-4 on penalties, will take on Port Vale.
	   Ipwish, No. 2 in the standings, will travel to Barnsley, while
Birmingham City hosts Oxford United and Watford plays Stockport.
	   In Scottish Premier League matches Saturday, league leaders
Glasgow Rangers play Aberdeen, St. Johnstone take on defending
titlist Celtic, Motherwell hosts Hearts and Dundee play Kilmarnock.
	   The F.A. Cup also kicks-off Saturday with the bulk of the first
round pairings featuring soccer minnows.
	   Among the mis-matches, League Cup quarterfinalist Luton will
play non-league team Boreham Wood.
	   Former England international Kerry Dixon, who played for Luton
and Chelsea in a 593-match league career, will turn out for Boreham
Wood against his old club.

	   DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) _ Aircraft manufacturer Boeing
has opened a spare parts outlet at Dubai International Airport, its
first service center in the Middle East, the company announced
Thursday.
	   The 36,000-square-foot (3,300-square-meter) facility will
initially maintain an inventory of 13,000 parts _ worth dlrs 10
million.
	   It is linked electronically to Boeing's worldwide distribution
network.
	   Company spokesman Darce Lamb told reporters the center was
designed to deliver parts in hours. It had already received 100
orders since it became operational on Tuesday.
	   According to Boeing, the number of commercial airplanes in the
Middle East is expected to more than double to 670 in the next 20
years.
	   ____
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The price index of the Kuwait Stock Exchange
closed 1.95 percent down at 1,897.1 points at the end of this
trading week, a market report said Thursday.
	   Losses were partly caused by ``the tense political situation in
the area,'' the weekly report by the National Investments Co. said.
The United States and Britain are preparing a military strike
against Iraq to force the country to resume cooperation with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   Trading on the exchange has slowed considerably during the past
few weeks because of lack of liquidity.
	   Some 73.02 million shares were traded this week, down 62.65
percent from last week. The value of these shares dropped 62.52
percent to 15.72 million dinars (dlrs 52.05 million).
	   The National Investment Co. said out of the 66 companies traded
this week, only seven closed higher while 39 closed lower, and the
rest were unchanged.
	   The exchange lists 76 companies and is considered one of the
most active bourses in the Arab world.
	   ____
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Business was sluggish at the Baghdad Stock
Exchange this week as a U.S. military strike became increasingly
likely.
	   The 100-point index closed at 933, a drop of 3 per cent over
last week, the market's bulletin said Thursday.
	   The number of shares traded was 30 per cent lower at 2.8
million.
	   The value of these shares was 348.2 million (dlrs 204,000), 14
percent down from last week's figure.
	   The bulletin, reflecting activity for the three business days
ending Wednesday, said the bourse had hit its lowest level this
year, but the decline was within manageable limits.
	   ``The slump is within our predicted range. We do not allow the
index to rise or drop by more than 10 per cent,'' a bourse official
said.
	   He said issues on offer this week had outstripped demand.
	   Demand for government bonds dropped 79 per cent, the bulletin
said. It said only 67 bonds were traded.
	   The Iraqi dinar, however, has so far weathered the crisis. It
remained steady throughout the week, trading at 1,750 to the U.S.
dollar.
	   The United States is threatening military action to force Iraq
to resume cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors charged with
overseeing the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   ____
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Share prices fell further this week, but
turnover increased slightly on the Jordanian stock exchange owing
to the tension over Iraq, brokers said Thursday.
	   A market report, reflecting activity for five business days
ending Wednesday, said the 60-company general share prices index
had dropped 1.30 percent to 160.61 points.
	   Shares of industrial firms dropped by 1.73 points, commercial
banks by 1.19 percent, service companies by 1.37 percent and
insurance firms by 0.19 percent.
	   Turnover increased 1.1 percent to 4.63 million Jordanian dinars
(dlrs 6.52 million), the report said.
	   The stocks of 86 firms were traded.
	   ____
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's National Electricity Corp. will
lease a small power station to a private company for five years, an
official of the state-run company said in remarks published
Thursday.
	   About 320 workers will lose their jobs as the private firm will
retain only 60 of the current staff, the corporation's director of
generation, Makawi Mohammed Awad, said in remarks published in the
daily Akhbar Al-Yom.
	   The private firm will undertake to repair Khartoum's Burri
station and run it to produce 15 megawatts of electricity a day,
Awad said.
	   Awad did not reveal the value of the contract nor the name of
the private company.
	   The power station was inaugurated in 1956 and requires
maintenance work before production can resume.
	   ``If this experience is a success, we are going to lease all the
other remaining small stations to investors, and we will
concentrate on big electricity stations'' Awad said.
	   The move is likely to meet some political opposition as occurred
when the government privatized the Sudan Telecommunications Company
in 1993.

German official says EU door open for Turkey
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ In a shift of German policy, a senior
foreign ministry official was quoted Thursday as saying that Turkey
``naturally'' could join the European Union one day.
	   Turkish-German relations have been strained since the EU refused
to open membership talks with Ankara last year. Turkey accused
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of wanting to keep the trade bloc a
club of Christian nations.
	   ``The former government's stand toward Turkey was wrong and
damaging,'' Guenter Verheugen, a deputy foreign minister in the new
center-left government, told the Rheinische Post newspaper.
	   ``It is in our interest to anchor Turkey firmly in the western
democratic camp. We reject the notion that the European Union
cannot open up to a country because it does not belong to the
Christian culture.
	   ``Turkey naturally is a country that could be considered for
full membership,'' Verheugen said, but he added it was ``much too
early'' to talk about including it in the current round of EU
expansion talks.
	   Still, to promote ``western standards of the rule of law,'' the
EU must offer Turkey a perspective for the future, he said.

Leakey: security forces poach Kenyan wildlife for meat
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHEGE MBITIRU
 &UR; Associated Press Writer

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ Some members of the Kenyan security forces
use their government-issue weapons to poach wildlife for meat, the
new director of the Kenya Wildlife Service said Thursday.
	   ``I believe there are members of the uniformed forces _ army,
police and administration police _ who are using their weapons for
poaching,'' Richard Leakey told The Associated Press.
	   Police spokesman Emmanuel Mwachiti said uniformed forces are not
allowed to shoot wild animals for food.
	   ``If anyone does that, it is as an individual and should be
reported to the nearest police station and action will be taken,''
Mwachiti said.
	   The Defense Department spokesman was not immediately available
for comment, but Mwachiti said the rules governing police officers
also apply to the military.
	   Hunting was outlawed in Kenya in 1977.
	   In earlier comments to reporters, Leakey said poaching was so
widespread in the East African nation that the meat of officially
protected wild animals is even available even at small roadside
stands where travelers stop for traditional roasted goat and beef.
	   Leakey said the wildlife service will try to reduce poaching,
something it had been able to do under his previous stint as
director.
	   Leakey, a renown conservationist and paleoanthropologist,
resigned from the job four years ago under pressure from President
Daniel arap Moi and politicians around him.
	   Moi recalled him last month to replace David Western as the
service was teetering on the brink of bankruptcy.
	   Leakey briefed reporters on the problems facing the organization
which is charged with the protection of Kenya's wildlife, the
backbone of its tourism industry.
	   After tea, tourism is Kenya's main foreign currency earner.
	   Leakey said that since he took over, the service has been able
to pay off its debts with a government grant or is in the process
of doing so.
	   ``I am confident there is a very good chance that we can stay in
the black,'' he said. ``We have no liability that we have not
cleared or are not in the process of so doing.''
	   Last month Leakey said KWS was broke and faced a deficit likely
to reach more than 500 million shillings (about dlrs 8 million) in
the financial year ending last June.
	   He said the service faces the daunting job of repairing roads
and national park fences, tightening management, stopping theft and
tightening security in wildlife sanctuaries.
	   While he said there would be no ``witch-hunting,'' Leakey said
anyone found to have engaged in theft in the last four years will
be dismissed and, where sufficient evidence exists, prosecuted.
	   Acknowledging that KWS has received massive donor support since
it was set up in 1989, Leakey, who was its first director, said the
service is not rushing to ask for more.
	   ``We need to wean ourselves from donor support,'' Leakey said.
``We have become too complacent.''

Danish goalkeeper to quit Man United at end of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Schmeichel quote; minor editing

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Veteran Danish goalkeeper Danish
goalkeeper annonced Thursday that he will quit Manchester United
and English soccer at the end of the season.
	   Schmeichel, who is rated as one of the world's top 'keepers,
said he hopes to continue his career in another country.
	   Two French clubs, Olympique Marseille and Monaco, have been
linked with the 34-year-old Danish international.
	   ``I am enjoying the game as much as ever but it is getting
harder to keep pace,'' Schmeichel told a news conference at Old
Trafford. ``I need to train more than I have ever had to in order
to prepare myself properly. I need more time between games than I
can get in England.''
	   Schmeichel, who has made more than 300 appearances for United
since joining the club in 1991, has been under increased scrutiny
this season because of his age, injuries and crucial blunders.
	   The Dane's mistake in the last minute of United's Champions
League game against Bayern Munich in September cost the club a
victory.
	   Schmeichel, who turns 35 next week, has also been dogged by
injuries recently and has missed two games this season with back
trouble.
	   United has been reportedly searching for a successor to
Schmeichel and has been consistently linked with Aston Villa's
Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich.
	   Schmeichel, who joined United from Danish side Brondby in 1991,
has played a key role in making United the most successful English
club of the 1990s.
	   He has helped the Red Devils win four Premier League titles, two
FA Cups and the League Cup. Last February against Derby, he became
the first goalkeeper to register 100 shutouts in the Premiership.
	   Schmeichel has been been capped a national record 107 times by
Denmkark, three more times than Michael Laudrup. He was the
starting 'keeper for Denmark during the World Cup in France.
	   Schmeichel's current backup at United is 35-year-old Dutch
'keeper Raimond van der Gouw. United's other 'keeper is 20-year-old
Nicky Culkin, who has yet to play a League match for the senior
side.

Prosecutors know identity of suspect in `knife case'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Prosecutors know the identity of a fan who
threw a reported knife at Italian soccer star Dino Baggio, injuring
him during a UEFA Cup match in the southern city of Krakow last
month.
	   ``Charges will be presented when police find the person,''
prosecutor Jan Koscisz told The Associated Press Thursday from his
office in Krakow. The suspect is also wanted for assaulting a
policeman and another unnamed person.
	   Polish press reports have continued to identify the thrown
object thrown from the stands as a knife, although prosecutors
declined to confirm that, describing it only as a ``dangerous
device.''
	   The suspect will be charged with intent ``to cause serious
injuries to the body and causing light injuries to the head.''
	   Baggio needed five stitches to close a head wound after he was
struck in the 80th minute of the Oct. 20 match between AC Parma and
Wisla Krakow.
	   The teams tied 1-1 in the second-round, first-leg match.
	   Wisla officials, who denied Baggio was struck by a knife, have
announced a zloty 5,000 (dlrs 1,470) reward for help in identifying
the suspect.

Noise of lovesick fish drowns out sonar on Norwegian submarines
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian navy's submarine corps has run
into an unexpected problem _ lovesick fish _ during dives off the
nation's coast.
	   Teeming schools of passionate cod, in the midst of a frenzied
mating season, make so much noise that the submarines' sonar can't
hear anything else, making it almost impossible to navigate under
the cold waters of the Norwegian Sea, a defense study said
Thursday.
	   The cod grunt repeatedly to attract potential mates.
	   ``This is the first time we have registered the frequency of
sounds from wild cod,'' researcher Erling Kjellsby was quoted as
telling Norway's largest newspaper, Verdens Gang. ``The noise of
cod looking for partners ruins the listening conditions.''
	   The study by the Norwegian Defense Research Institute said the
fish grunts overload sonar systems, and mask sound waves that sonar
transmits to detect objects underwater.

Roma returns home sweet home to take on Juventus
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ There's no place like home for AS Roma.
	   Coach Zdenek Zeman's club has been dominant at the friendly
confines of Olympic Stadium, compiling a perfect mark of four wins
in four home games so far _ including against Italian League leader
Fiorentina and a strong Udinese outfit _ and has outscored the
opposition a combined 11-2 in those matches.
	   On the road, by contrast, third-place Roma has yet to win in
four tries against mostly mediocre competition.
	   So it's no surprise that Zeman and his charges like their
chances heading into the biggest match of the season to date, when
Roma hosts two-time defending champion Juventus, itself a mediocre
1-2-1 away from Turin, on Sunday before a crowd that will top
70,000.
	   ``We can allow ourselves to think big. We are convinced that we
can win this game, though it won't be easy,'' said Luigi Di Biagio,
who returns from a two-game suspension to motor the offense from
his central midfield spot.
	   Fiorentina (at Piacenza Sunday) heads the league with 18 points,
one ahead of Juventus, and four ahead of both Roma and AC Milan (at
Bari Sunday night).
	   Other games in Sunday's ninth round are Empoli vs. Cagliari,
Internazionale of Milan vs. Sampdoria of Genoa, AC Parma vs.
Udinese, Salernitana vs. Perugia, Venezia vs. Lazio of Rome, and
Vicenza vs. Bologna.
	   There are other factors favoring Roma, too.
	   The league suspended Juventus coach Marcello Lippi for this game
because he yelled at the referee at the end of last weekend's 2-2
draw at Udinese, and the club will be playing its first Serie A
game since Alessandro Del Piero went down with knee ligament
damage. The star striker, who can carry a team when he's in form,
is expected to be sidelined five months, and Juventus has started
looking for a forward to fill in.
	   Del Piero is expected to head to Lyon, France, Friday to be
examined by Pierre Chambat, the orthopedic specialist who has
worked with Lazio forward Christian Vieri and top skier Deborah
Compagnoni on their knee injuries.
	   Making matters worse for Juve, French playmaker Zinedine Zidane
limped off the field after 20 minutes of action Wednesday night in
Juve's 2-2 Italian Cup draw at Venezia.
	   ``We will have an advantage, there's no denying it,'' Di Biagio
said.
	   Juventus was already thin up front, especially after shipping
Uruguayan striker Marcelo Zalayeta to Empoli last month. Now it's
time to experiment. Lippi tried defenders Ciro Ferrara (who
actually scored the goal that eliminated Venezia) and Igor Tudor of
Croatia in attack during the Italian Cup game.
	   It all adds up to a tough task for Juventus, which will find
itself tied for second place with Roma if it loses.
	   This game also has a subplot of interest, though both Lippi and
Zeman have refused to discuss it this week. The two coaches have
engaged in a war of words through the media all season, sparked by
Zeman's remarks over the summer implying that some Juve players may
have used performance-enhancing substances.
	   Those comments led to the series of ongoing investigations into
doping and drug testing in Italian soccer.

Loyalists protest Taipei mayor's use of Sun Yat-sen image
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Conservatives clashed with police Thursday
in a protest against the use of Sun Yat-sen's image in an election
campaign ad that they say insults the founder of the Chinese
republic.
	   Legislative and city council candidates from the New Party
struggled with police guarding Mayor Chen Shui-bian's campaign
office in central Taipei. No injuries were reported or arrests
made.
	   They were demanding the removal of a massive outdoor wall poster
that shows a photo of Sun with the words ``I think Chen Shui-bian
is doing pretty well'' printed in a speech bubble above him.
	   ``The father of the nation of course never even knew Chen
Shui-bian, and would never identify with Chen Shui-bian,'' Fung
Hu-hsiang, a New Party legislative candidate, shouted through a
loudhailer.
	   Chen aide Shao Li-ping told the protesters to relax.
	   ``Politicians in modern, mature, democratic societies often use
humorous means to transmit their message. Taiwan's society ought to
be mature to this degree,'' Shao told a news conference.
	   The New Party was formed by disaffected members of the ruling
Nationalist Party, formed by Sun in China and moved to Taiwan by
Chiang Kai-shek amid a civil war with Mao Tse-tung's Communists in
1949. Taiwan's government traces its roots to the Republic of China
that Sun established after a brief 1911 revolution.
	   The New Party claims to be the true inheritors of Sun's
political philosophy, and strongly advocates Taiwan's unification
with China.
	   Sun's birthday Thursday was a national holiday, and his
mustachioed image still appears on Taiwan's money.
	   Chen represents the main opposition Democratic Progressive
Party, which draws support from the island's native Taiwanese
majority and calls for Taiwan's formal and permanent independence
from China. He faces a difficult re-election bid against a strong
Nationalist rival in elections Dec. 5.

Disputed Kuril Islands dominate Russian-Japanese summit

agreements, Yeltsin to visit Japan; EDITS thruout to trim and

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin presented Japan's prime
minister with a plan Thursday to resolve the conflict that has
divided their nations for more than half a century _ the ownership
of the disputed Kuril Islands.
	   Yeltsin warmly greeted Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi at the
Kremlin, and later handed him Russia's long-awaited response to
Japan's proposals to settle the dispute on the Kurils.
	   No details of the plan were released, but Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said it called for ``joint economic
management'' of the islands.
	   Obuchi's spokesman, Sadaaki Numata, said the Japanese side had
not had time to fully digest the Russian proposal, and could not
characterize its response. However, he said, ``I think we are
solidly on the way ... to a peace treaty by 2000.''
	   He said Japan would formally respond to the Russian proposal at
the next meeting of the two leaders. He said Obuchi had invited
Yeltsin to visit Japan ``at the earliest opportunity'' in 1999, and
Yeltsin had agreed.
	   In another step forward, the two leaders agreed to establish two
new subcommittees _ one to seek a solution to the territorial
dispute, and another to look into joint economic development of the
islands.
	   Japan agreed to bankroll the economic development of the islands
with dlrs 100 million. It also agreed to free up dlrs 800 million
of a previously agreed-upon loan to Russia, and to give dlrs 10
million in medical assistance.
	   Russia, in turn, agreed to a Japanese request to allow aging
Japanese natives of the islands, driven out during World War II, to
return and see their old homes.
	   Although the meeting clearly produced progress, a final
agreement is expected to be a long, difficult process.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented
Tokyo's proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in
Japan in April. The proposals have not been made public. According
to media reports, Tokyo has suggested an arrangement that would
recognize Japanese sovereignty over the islands, but would allow
Russia to retain control for some time.
	   Meanwhile, the two leaders were expected to sign previously
resolved agreements on investment protection and cooperation in
transport, tourism and environmental protection.
	   ``It's good that our agreements are being implemented. I think
we should fulfill the program,'' Yeltsin said at the outset of the
meeting, according to the Interfax news agency.
	   Still, the main task before the leaders was resolution of the
dispute over four islands in the Kurils. The islands, known to
Japanese as the Northern Territories, were once held by Tokyo but
have been controlled by Moscow since the end of World War II.
	   Both nations claim ownership, and the dispute is the main reason
they haven't signed a formal peace treaty ending the war.
	   ``I believe that our generation carries the responsibility for
making sure that the problems that have arisen in this century are
solved before it is over and are not shifted to the shoulders of
our children and grandchildren,'' Obuchi told the Russian daily
newspaper Izvestia in an interview published Wednesday.
	   Tokyo got legal control of the islands now in contention _
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty
with Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing
days of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since as
illegal.
	   The islands have only about 17,000 Russian inhabitants, but the
waters around them are rich fishing grounds.
	   The summit was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting since his
latest illness sidelined him a month ago. The president's office
said Wednesday that the 67-year-old leader planned to visit Japan
next spring or summer.
	   The dlrs 800 million loan announced by Japan is part of a dlrs
22.6 billion bailout package arranged by the International Monetary
Fund this summer. But the IMF and the World Bank have put their
loans on hold after Russia succumbed to economic crisis in August.
	   No timetable has been set for the release of the Japanese loan,
but Numata said it ``would not be a months-long wait.''

Wife: Yeltsin feels well, has trouble adjusting to cold weather
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ President Boris Yeltsin feels well after a
weeklong vacation at a Black Sea resort, but is having trouble
adjusting to Moscow's freezing weather, the president's wife said
Thursday.
	   After a relatively warm October, temperatures in Moscow have
dropped to record lows for this time of year, reaching -19 degrees
C (-2 F) at night, since Yeltsin returned from the Sochi resort on
Sunday.
	   Yeltsin went on vacation to recover from what aides described as
fatigue and high blood pressure. The ailments, coming on top of a
respiratory infection a month ago, have led to renewed speculations
about his ability to govern.
	   Yeltsin met with visiting Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi
on Thursday, while Yeltsin's wife Naina spent the day touring
Moscow with Obuchi's wife Tizuko.
	   The Russian president is feeling well, ``only the
acclimatization is proceeding rather difficultly,'' Naina Yeltsin
told Mrs. Obuchi, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``I think he will no longer feel (the climate change) in a few
days,'' Mrs. Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   She would not say whether Yeltsin planned to resume his vacation
after Obuchi leaves Moscow.
	   ``We have not talked about that,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said.
	   The 67-year-old Russian leader has suffered from a range of
health troubles in the past, including a quintuple heart bypass
surgery two years ago. But he insists he has no major health
problems and intends to serve out his term, which runs until
mid-2000.

Estonia provides trickle of water to dry Russian border town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) - Estonia allowed a trickle of drinking
water to flow into a desperate Russian border town Thursday, almost
three days after cutting off the town's only water supply for
failing to pay dlrs 1.2 million in water bills.
	   The Estonian city of Narva has the region's main water utility,
and provides all the water used by Ivangorod, a Russian town of
12,000 people just over the border.
	   Estonia complains that nonpayment of water bills has been an
ongoing problems made worse by Russia's economic crisis. Narva shut
off Ivangorod's water on Tuesday.
	   After urgent talks between Estonian Prime Minister Mart Siimann
and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko by
telephone, Moscow promised to begin paying part of Ivangorod's
bill.
	   However, Narva officials only restored 25 percent of the Russian
city's water supply because it was not clear whether Russia would
pay the entire bill, which has run up during the past year, the
Baltic News Service reported.
	   Ivangorod had appealed to the Russian and Estonian governments
for help in ending the water crisis.
	   Ivangorod and Narva, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of
Tallinn, have shared a water system since before World War II, when
Ivangorod was part of Estonia. They continued to share the system
after Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
	   When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ivangorod became part
of Russia, while Narva remained part of independent Estonia. Under
Russia, Ivangorod's economy slumped into near-ruin, while Narva's
economy is comparatively robust.

Kosovo Albanians reported detained, threatened
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS with source now saying Serb civilians abducted
Albanians, other details.
 &UR; By ISMET HAJDARI
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed Serb civilians detained dozens
of Albanians on Thursday and threatened to kill some of them unless
two Serbs apparently abducted by separatist guerrillas were
released, a Kosovo Albanian organization said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of the main
Albanian political party in the Serbian province, initially said
Serb police had taken 20 Albanians off a bus coming from
Montenegro.
	   But later, the center blamed armed Serb civilians and said up to
100 had been detained by early Thursday. It said the Serbs began
stopping vehicles carrying Albanians on a main road near the border
to Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with Serbia.
	   The Serbs, armed with submachine guns, were seeking the release
of two fellow Serbs who went missing Wednesday in the central
Drenica region, said the center. It said some of those detained
were threatened with ``liquidation'' unless the two Serbs were
released.
	   Dozens of the detained Albanians were taken away to the village
of Crnac, 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Pristina. Some of
them phoned Pristina to relay their abductors' demands for the
release of the two Serbs.
	   ``If we failed to do this, they said they would kill us,'' Ismet
Haziri, one of those taken by the Serbs, was quoted as saying
	   Serb sources confirmed the abduction but said those taken were
being released. One of those released, Rrahim Kadriu, said about 30
people remained in the custody of the Serbs and speculated their
captors would try to hold them until the two Serbs were released.
	   William Walker, the American heading a still-forming
international team of Kosovo monitors said his people would ``take
appropriate steps'' after finding out exact circumstances of the
abductions.
	   The detentions reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian
tensions in Kosovo despite a lessening of bloodshed in the wake of
an Oct. 12 agreement ending a nearly eight-month crackdown on
Kosovo Albanian guerrillas fighting for independence. The crackdown
in the Albanian-majority Serbian province left hundreds dead _
mostly Albanian civilians _ and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands more.
	   The province is rent by inter-Albanian tensions as well.
	   Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova's camp is at odds with supporters
of the Kosovo Liberation Army guerrillas. Both factions want
Kosovo's independence from Serbia. But Rugova opposes the KLA's
armed struggle and is prepared to settle for a return of autonomy
for Kosovo, as outlined in the U.S.-sponsored plan accepted by
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic under the threat of NATO air
strikes.
	   On Thursday, a pro-KLA Kosovo Albanian political coalition
warned Rugova against plans to organized a predominantly Albanian
police force for the province as foreseen by the October agreement.
	   The coalition said that the KLA was already policing Albanian
areas of Kosovo and ``statements about forming another police force
... would lead to factionalization'' of Kosovo's Albanian entity.
	   In reality, the pro and anti-Rugova factions are already deeply
split. Earlier this week, Adem Demaci, the guerillas' spokesman,
bluntly warned Rugova to butt out of organizing police, saying that
was the KLA's business. And he said the time had passed for any
attempts to paper over differences with Rugova.
	   Even if Serb authorities cooperate, Kosovo Albanian differences
could sour internationally backed attempts to implement the October
plan and start the process of Albanian autonomy in Kosovo.
	   The U.S. envoy to Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
the October agreement was taking shape, ``but we have a long way to
go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet Walker, said he would be going to
Belgrade on Friday to meet authorities there on implementation of
the autonomy plan.
	   Walker pledged a ``robust effort'' on the part of what will be a
2,000-strong monitoring team of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to check on authorities' pledges to scale
back troops and other provisions of the October agreement.
	   Kosovo's violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
the province.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   Police accuse the rebels of attacking to try to provoke a harsh
response that could prompt world leaders to order military strikes.

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss balloon pilot Bertrand Piccard and a British
teammate, flight engineer Tony Brown, said Thursday they will be
ready later this month for a new attempt to fly nonstop round the
world.
	   Their new Breitling Orbiter 3 balloon will take off from Chateau
d'Oex, in the Swiss Alps, after Nov. 25 as soon as weather
conditions are favorable, they said.
	   It will be Piccard's third attempt to be the first to pilot a
balloon around the world.
	   In February the Swiss pilot, along with British flight engineer
Andy Elson and Belgian pilot Wim Verstraeten, broke the record for
the longest time spent in the air by a balloon, landing in Myanmar,
also Burma, after a flight lasting 9 days, 17 hours and 55 minutes.
	   The balloon's round-the-world bid was abandoned after China
refused it entry, causing it to miss out on jet-stream winds needed
to speed it over the Pacific.
	   But the team has received conditional permission from China for
this attempt, flight director Alan Noble told a news conference in
Geneva.
	   The balloon's route should take it across the Mediterranean Sea,
Turkey, Iran, Afghanistan, China and Japan before crossing the
Pacific and North America and returning to Europe, a three-week
journey of some 26,700 kilometers (16,600 miles).
	   Piccard said he believed the two men would work well together in
the cramped conditions of the balloon's cabin.
	   ``We are very different. There will be Tony, there will be me,
and there will be both of us together,'' he said.
	   Two of the Breitling team's challengers, Virgin Atlantic
Airlines chief Richard Branson and Chicago millionaire Steve
Fossett, are joining forces for their next attempt.
	   In August, Fossett broke his own distance record, traveling more
than 24,461 kilometers (15,200 miles) before a storm damaged his
balloon, sending it plunging into the sea off Australia.

Students complain of harsh treatment, police say
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By NADIA RYBAROVA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE , Czech Republic (AP) _ Students at a private American
school in Moravia confirm they were excessively punished and held
against their will at the institution, where four staff members
have been charged, police said Thursday.
	   Investigator Petr Netik said in a telephone interview from Brno,
200 kilometers (125 miles) southeast of Prague, that eight of the
25 children interviewed by police complained that educational
methods at the school were too harsh.
	   Charges were filed against four employees of the school, two of
them U.S. citizens, Netik said. The four, charged with cruelty to
people in their custody and with curtailing the students' freedom
of movement, are being prosecuted at liberty.
	   One of the Americans was released on a 200,000 koruna (dlrs
6,600) bail. The four face up to eight years in jail if convicted,
Netik said.
	   Robert Bezdek, the lawyer of the two Americans involved,
identified them as Glenda Roach, principal of the school, and her
husband Steven, of St. George, Utah.
	   ``Some of the children said they were isolated in a room where
they had to lie on their bellies, sometimes with their hands tied
behind their backs, and were given only a limited amount of
water,'' Netik said.
	   ``They also were not allowed to go to the bathroom when they
needed,'' he added.
	   Police interviewed 25 of the 57 students over the weekend, and
eight of them confirmed suspicions they had been ill treated,
according to Netik. But he admitted that some of them said they
liked it at the school.
	   ``We consider it a detention facility,'' he said, adding that
the school failed to provide medical care, and the staff did not
have adequate professional training.
	   ``Their only qualification was their knowledge of English,'' he
said.
	   But Bezdek, the lawyer, indicated that the children may have
lied to the police, referring to serious problems some of them had
at home, including drug problems.
	   ``Police made a mistake not to have a psychologist attend the
interviews,'' Bezdek said. ``Nobody will ever find out whether the
kids were telling the truth.''
	   Last week, Martin Pilka, the co-owner of the Morava Academy
agency that runs the school, told The Associated Press that the
school is a regular boarding school for American teen-agers who
were neglecting school at home and had problems getting along with
their families.
	   He ruled out any harsh methods, saying the children regularly
went for walks and excursions.
	   Pilka said that first of the students arrived last March for a
course of up to ten month.
	   He said Ralph Atkin, also of St. George, Utah, is the majority
owner of Morava Academy.
	   On its internet website, Morava Academy offers an ``effective
program to help teens replace inappropriate attitudes, behaviors
and habits with new, productive ones'' at dlrs 60 per day. It also
offers an ``excellent educationl program,'' including German
classes.
	   However, it also warns that inappropriate behavior is
``confronted ... and reduced.''
	   Netik said Thursday that the treatment of the students may be
violating the U.N. Convention on the Rights of the Child, ratified
by the Czech Republic in 1990.

Blair issues fresh warning to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS briefing of lawmakers grafs 3-4; trims pvs &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ British Prime Minister Tony Blair on Thursday
issued a fresh warning to Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein of imminent
military strikes, saying that ``the next step is action.''
	   ``We have been through the threats and the strong words,'' Blair
said in a British Broadcasting Corp. radio interview. ``He has got
to come back into compliance or action will follow.''
	   Also Thursday, Blair's office issued briefing documents to
members of Parliament on the threat posed by Saddam, including
Iraq's ability to secretly develop usable chemical weapons within
months, and his relatively easy access to Scud missiles.
	   Iraq also is still trying to build nuclear weapons and has been
blocked only by the tough international embargo imposed by the
United Nations, the documents said.
	   Britain and the United States have repeatedly threatened the use
of force if Iraq doesn't back down in the latest standoff over U.N.
weapons inspections.
	   On Oct. 31, Saddam decided to halt all work by the U.N. Special
Commission, which oversees the dismantling of Iraq's chemical and
biological weapons and long-range missiles.
	   Iraq is required to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction
before U.N. sanctions can be lifted. But Baghdad has said the
disarmament work cannot resume until the U.N. Security Council
gives a timetable for lifting the economic sanctions imposed after
the 1991 Gulf War.
	   U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday ordered additional
military buildup, while Britain joined the United States in urging
their citizens to evacuate the area.

ICRC restarts relief operations in Chiapas
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The International Committee of the Red Cross said
Thursday it has made its first relief distributions in Chiapas
since returning to the southern Mexican state in September.
	   The ICRC and the Mexican Red Cross delivered food and soap to
eight villages in the Chenalho district in last week's operation,
an ICRC statement said.
	   ``The operation was designed to ensure the survival of displaced
persons and local residents who have been giving them shelter and
find themselves deprived of access to their fields,'' it continued.
	   Distributions will be made to the same villages every two weeks,
the ICRC said. Other areas will be added if required.
	   In May, the ICRC reached a new agreement with the Mexican
government allowing it to resume humanitarian activities in
Chiapas.
	   After the 1994 rebellion by the leftist Zapatista National
Liberation Army, the ICRC supported medical care efforts and also
served as escort for Zapatista delegates attending peace talks with
the government.
	   Some Mexican officials were uncomfortable with the ICRC role,
arguing that the conflict was a Mexican affair that should not
involve international agencies. Its activity tailed off sharply
after mid-1995.
	   Last month, Mexico's Red Cross announced it was canceling all
relief efforts in the Chiapas because of a lack of funds. It said
it could only continue operating there with international Red Cross
help.
	   The organization operated shelters for hundreds left homeless by
flooding and by the conflict between government forces and
Zapatista rebels.

Portuguese university students strike against education fee
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Most of Portugal's 250,000 university
students stayed away from classes Thursday in a one-day strike to
protest an increase in fees for higher education.
	   The action was part of ongoing opposition to a law stipulating
that students at public and private universities contribute 56,700
Portuguese escudos (dlrs 330) per year toward the cost of higher
education.
	   Many students see as the law as the first step towards scrapping
state-funded higher education.
	   Not all students joined the action. Some students said they
disagreed with the form of protest because they would miss exams
scheduled for Thursday.
	   Students previously paid a token annual fee of up to 1,200
escudos (dlrs 7), with the state providing most of the funding for
universities.
	   Many students have refused to pay the increased fee, which came
into force in September.
	   So far, no punitive measures have been taken against students
who have not paid.
	   The Socialist party came to power in 1995 pledging changes to
improve all levels of education.
	   Efforts by the previous Social Democratic government to raise
the students' contribution met with fierce opposition and caused
the resignation of two education ministers between 1992 and 1995.

Russia expects to begin receiving E.U. food aid in January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: UPDATES throughout with Russia preparing to formally request
food aid from EU; ADDS byline. &QL; 
 &UR; By GREG MYRE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia expects to wrap up a food aid deal soon
with the European Union and should begin receiving wheat, rice,
beef and pork in early January, a top official said Thursday.
	   The Russian government is bracing for a harsh winter and last
week signed a separate food aid agreement with the United States as
part of an effort to ensure that stockpiles last until the spring.
	   The Russians and the EU reached a tentative agreement several
days ago, but Russia must still send a letter formally requesting
the aid, Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said.
	   ``I haven't sent the official letter yet, but I may send it
today,'' Kulik told a news conference. ``We are planning on the
first shipment to be delivered no later than the first half of
January.''
	   The aid package is expected to be worth about 400 million
European currency units (dlrs 480 million) and consist of 1 million
metric tons (1.1 million tons) of wheat, and smaller amounts of
rye, rice, pork, beef and vegetable oils.
	   Russia has not experienced any serious food shortages so far,
but the government doesn't want to risk getting caught short in the
middle of winter, when deliveries to remote areas are difficult and
expensive.
	   Meanwhile, Russia's central banker said the government won't
bail out domestic banks whose assets are frozen by foreign
creditors.
	   Central Bank Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said the Central Bank
can't do anything to help Russian commercial banks whose assets are
frozen overseas, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported.
	   A government-declared moratorium on debt payments that had
protected Russian banks is due to expire within days.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov struck a similar tone Wednesday
when he said the government would not guarantee private deposits in
commercial banks.
	   ``We live in a market economy,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``If Russians want guarantees, they should
put their money in Sberbank,'' the national savings bank.
	   Gerashchenko's remarks were aimed specifically at Russian banks
that don't fulfill currency forward contracts with foreign banks.
Under terms of those contracts, the Russian banks agreed to buy
rubles from Western banks for dollars at a previously agreed-upon
exchange rate _ a deal they now cannot possibly meet.
	   The bank chairman said he expects the foreign banks to begin
freezing the assets of the Russian banks after expiration of the
moratorium.
	   Russian banks' liabilities on such contracts are estimated at
dlrs 7 billion.
	   ``The central bank can't take on itself fulfillment of
obligations for forward contracts,'' Gerashchenko said. He noted
that the Central Bank can only give recommendations for the
conditions under which the commercial banks' debts should be
restructured.

Former troops of Myanmar ex-druglord Khun Sa attack heroin
</HEADLINE>
traffickers &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: Shan commander Yodsak uses one name only &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   CHIANG MAI, Thailand (AP) _ Guerrillas once led by a man reputed
to be the world's biggest heroin trafficker have attacked a convoy
of drug smugglers in Myanmar, a Thai intelligence officer said
Thursday.
	   About 100 men of the Shan State Army, once commanded by the
notorious trafficker Khun Sa, attacked more than 30 men from the
Lahu Democratic Front early Wednesday, said the officer, speaking
on condition of anonymity. He said the intruders were trying to
cross into the northern Thai province of Chiang Mai.
	   The commander of the Shans' southern region, Col. Yodsak, has
ordered his men to tighten security along the border as part of
efforts to crack down on heroin production and trafficking, said
the officer.
	   The claimed crackdown on narcotics is part of the Shans' effort
to drum up support from the international community and discredit
Myanmar's military rulers, who they claim are not serious about
curbing the drug trade.
	   One Thai suspected of working with the Lahu, Uthai Srisiriwilai,
26, was killed in the 10-minute gunfight, which spilled over to
Thai soil, and the other traffickers fled back to Myanmar, the
officer said. A Thai ranger unit had been put on standby.
	   Shan troops captured four Myanmar citizens _ all Lahus _ and
confiscated four AK-47 assault rifles, five 1.75-kilogram
(3.85-pound) bags of heroin and two field radios. The men and
material were handed over to Thai army rangers at the border, said
the officer.
	   The Shan and the Lahu are two of the many ethnic minorities who
live in the eastern border regions of Myanmar, also known as Burma.
Most illicit drug production is carried on by ethnic minorities,
with ethnic Chinese dominating trafficking. Myanmar vies with
Afghanistan for the title of world's biggest heroin producer.
	   About 40 illicit laboratories producing heroin and amphetamines
are believed located in Shan State along the border with Thailand.
Yodsak has accused Myanmar military officers of receiving payoffs
from the drug producers.
	   Khun Sa's soldiers, scattered in Myanmar's jungles since the
opium warlord surrendered in 1996, began to reunite earlier this
year to resume their war against the government in Yangon, Thai
security officials say.
	   Khun Sa, who is half-Chinese and also known as Chang Chifu,
claimed his drug activities funded the Shan liberation struggle.
	   For more than a decade, Khun Sa was the kingpin of the Golden
Triangle _ the rugged, opium-rich region where the borders of
Myanmar, Thailand and Laos converge.
	   He commanded an army that ranged from 10,000-20,000 men and
controlled the lion's share of the area's traffic in opium, the raw
material for heroin. As time went by, however, rival opium armies
sprang up, diminishing his power.
	   Khun Sa was indicted on heroin trafficking charges by a U.S.
court, and Myanmar's military government branded him a
narco-terrorist, vowing to hang him if it captured him.
	   Weakened by splits in his army, Khun Sa surrendered to the
Myanmar government in January 1996. The government refused to
extradite him to the United States or to prosecute him under
Myanmar law.
	   Instead, it pardoned the opium lord, installed him in a villa in
Rangoon and granted him business concessions.

Croatian teachers stage one-day strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Elementary and high school teachers
across the country staged a one-day strike Thursday, demanding the
government increase education spending and their salaries.
	   About 80 percent of teachers nationwide took part in the
protest, disrupting classes in most schools. The move, aimed at
boosting wages and winning bonuses for preparational school work
done during holidays, came after months of fruitless negotiations
and a series of warning protests and walkouts.
	   ``The aim of our strike is to stop moral, material and
professional degradation'' of education, said Vesna Kanizaj,
chairman of the nation's five largest teachers unions.
	   Kanizaj said the unions were prepared to follow Thursday's
strike with a series of others if the government continues to
refuse an increase in spending on education. Strikes on May 20 and
June 4 paralyzed the education system earlier this year.
	   The government says it has no money for a wage increase, but the
teachers' unions insist education deserves more than 8 percent of
the dlrs 6.4 billion state budget.
	   On average, teachers earn the equivalent of dlrs 360 per month _
less than the national average salary of drls 400.
	   Discontent is swelling in Croatia as ordinary people struggle to
make do with paltry wages and rising costs, while a new elite grows
richer, its wealth widely rumored to be built on political
connections and corruption.

Mandela lawyers examining Hilton hotels' use of image
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela's
lawyers are looking into the use by Hilton hotel chain of Mandela's
picture in an advertising campaign, his spokesman said Thursday.
	   The aide, Parks Mankahlana, said that lawyers would handle the
matter and declined to elaborate, the South African Press
Association reported.
	   In the ads, which started appearing in United States newspapers
on Wednesday, Mandela's beaming image dominates a full-page Hilton
promotion in a picture taken at the London Hilton.
	   SAPA said the ad implies that Mandela recommended use of the
hotel chain to climb the success ladder. Positioned below his chin
are the words: ``Hilton helps you succeed whether you're a manager,
chairman or president.''
	   Mankahlana did not immediately return phone calls.

Security a worry as verifiers aim at December startup, OSCE says
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Yugoslavia-Kosovo &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ The head of Europe's largest security
organization voiced new concern Thursday about the safety of up to
2,000 unarmed verifiers who will be deployed in Kosovo early next
month.
	   Bronislaw Geremek, chairman of the 54-nation Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe which is overseeing the
verification mission, noted the deteriorating security situation in
the Serbian province.
	   Small-scale violence has increased in recent days despite an
Oct. 12 agreement on a cease-fire, the pullout of government forces
and the peaceful return of hundreds of thousands of refugees.
	   ``The cease-fire is breached on a daily basis, intimidation
continues, roadblocks are being erected, and, still, people are
being killed,'' said Geremek.
	   He said some 250 people a week will be sent to Kosovo starting
Dec. 2.
	   ``It means that at the beginning of the new year, the mission of
2,000 will be already in the region,'' said Geremek, who is the
Polish foreign minister.
	   He stressed he had received a firm commitment from the Yugoslav
government that the safety of the verifiers would be guaranteed.
	   ``I hope that a minimum of safety will be given to the
mission,'' he said. ``We also hope Kosovo Albanians will be fully
committed to this agreement,'' adding he had been given a pledge to
that effect from Ibrahim Rugova, the main ethnic Albanian leader
advocating non-violence.
	   Asked who's to blame for the continuing violence in Kosovo,
Geremek said he saw responsibility on both sides, meaning Serb
police and the ethnic Albanians' Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Indicating fears that fighting might resume in spring, he said
``I have a feeling that in March we'll face a difficult situation
concerning the role of the KLA on the ground. We'll see ... if it
is committed to the political dialogue.''

Greenpeace: Nuclear reprocessing plant emits radioactive carbon
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS response from state nuclear company in 4th graf

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The environmental watchdog group Greenpeace claimed
Thursday that the French nuclear reprocessing plant at La Hague
emits ``worrisome'' levels of radioactive carbon.
	   Greenpeace said an analysis of grass and leaves surrounding the
plant showed concentrations of carbon-14 that are two to seven
times greater than normal levels.
	   ``It is clear that the entire area surrounding La Hague,
especially the part downwind from the plant, is seriously
contaminated by radioactive carbon,'' Greenpeace said in a
statement.
	   Cogema, the state nuclear fuel reprocessing company, accused
Greenpeace of using scare tactics. ``I suppose the results are
correct, but the impact of such radioactivity levels is
negligible,'' said Cogema spokesman Philippe Pradel.
	   Carbon-14 is absorbed by plants, animals and humans, which can't
differentiate between stable carbon and the radioactive isotope,
Greenpeace said.
	   Earlier this week, Greenpeace said the La Hague plant was
emitting high levels of aerial radiation.
	   Spent fuel from the French nuclear power plants, as well as
Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany, Switzerland and Japan are
reprocessed at La Hague, which is operated by COGEMA.

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities chopped off the
right hand of an Egyptian man Thursday for stealing at Islam's
holiest site in Mecca, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded.
	   The SPA said Sharif Ali Ibrahim was convicted of pick pocketing
worshipers praying in the Grand Mosque next to the Kabaa, the focal
point of Muslim prayers.
	   Ibrahim's hand was cut off with a sword in the holy city of
Mecca in western Saudi Arabia, the agency said.
	   This was the fifth amputation this year. Over the past few
months, two Saudis, an Egyptian and an Afghan man had their right
hands cut off for pick pocketing in the same mosque.
	   Executions and amputations are carried out with a sword in a
public square.
	   So far this year, Saudi Arabia has beheaded 24 people. Last year
124 people were executed.

Indonesian leader urged to end violence in East Timor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with protest at Indonesian embassy &QL; 
 &UR; With BC-Indonesia-East Timor &QL; 
 &UR; By JOCELYN GECKER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ More than 100 people held a
candlelight vigil outside the Indonesian Embassy Thursday,
demanding that President B.J. Habibie put an end to violence in
East Timor.
	   They shouted, ``Free East Timor!'' and held banners that read
``Stop Military Oppression!'' as a small group of police watched
nearby.
	   The peaceful protest in Kuala Lumpur was to commemorate the
anniversary of a 1991 massacre of anti-Indonesian protesters.
	   Seven years ago, Indonesian troops fired on pro-independence
protesters in Dili, the East Timor capital. A government report put
the death toll at 50. Human rights activists say about 200 people
were killed.
	   Earlier, a coalition of Asian activists denounced an offer by
Habibie to give East Timor some autonomy in exchange for
recognition of Jakarta's sovereignty over the region.
	   ``We call for the Habibie administration to take genuine steps
for a peaceful solution in East Timor,'' said Nadiah Bamadhaj, of
the Malaysian East Timor Solidarity Group.
	   The activists also urged the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
group to address the problem. APEC officials have begun meeting in
Kuala Lumpur ahead of the Nov. 17-18 summit.
	   ``There is still ongoing struggle in East Timor,'' said Gus
Miclat, of the Manila-based Asia-Pacific Coalition for East Timor.
``We hope the APEC leaders would address that.''
	   The coalition called for the release of the nearly 200 jailed
activists, including rebel leader Xanana Gusmao. He is serving a
20-year prison term for fighting Indonesian troops.
	   At the candlelight vigil, Miclat read aloud a message to the
protesters that he said was obtained from Xanana in prison.
	   In the letter, Xanana called Habibie's efforts ``an
unprecedented step,'' but said human rights abuses had to stop.
	   ``Jakarta must commit itself to ending the activities of its
soldiers, intelligence agents and paramilitary groups that continue
to terrorize the population,'' Xanana said.
	   Meanwhile, some 10,000 mourners gathered at a graveyard in Dili,
the provincial capital of East Timor, to lay flowers on the graves
of the dead. They lit candles as police watched from a distance.
	   Indonesia annexed East Timor in 1976, a year after its troops
intervened in a civil war that broke out during the last days of
Portuguese rule.

FBI questions relatives of bombing victims and seriously injured
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) _ FBI agents this week began questioning
relatives of the victims of the Aug. 7 U.S. Embassy bombing as well
as the seriously injured on request of the U.S. Attorney's office
for the Southern District of New York, a U.S. official said
Thursday.
	   The blast at the embassy building in downtown Nairobi killed 213
people, 12 of them Americans, and injured 5,400.
	   In an nearly simultaneous bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Dar es
Salaam in neighboring Tanzania, 11 people were killed and 85 were
injured, none of them Americans.
	   The official, who could not be further identified, said the
questioning was aimed at gathering recorded testimony to be used by
the prosecution in the pre-sentencing phase of the trials of the
six men indicted in connection with the attack.
	   Wadih El Hage, Mohamed Sadeek Odeh and Mohamed Rashed Daoud
Al-'Owhali are being held by the U.S. District Court in the
Southern District of New York. All three have pleaded innocent.
	   Fazul Abdullah Mohammed is a fugitive.
	   Saudi exile Osama bin Laden, the alleged mastermind of a
conspiracy to attack U.S. targets around the world, and Muhammad
Atef, the alleged military commander of bin Laden's terrorist
organization, Al-Qaeda, were charged in a separate 238-page
indictment with murder and conspiracy in the bombings.
	   Bin Laden is believed to be living in Afghanistan.
	   U.S. law provides for the trial in the United States of those
charged in terror attacks against American citizens, even if
carried out on foreign soil.

Danish goalkeeper to quit Man United at end of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with more quotes from Schmeichel, manager Alex
Ferguson

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Veteran Danish goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel, who has helped Manchester United to four Premier League
titles in six years, announced Thursday that he's leaving the club
at the end of the season.
	   Schmeichel, who is rated as one of the world's top 'keepers,
said he can't cope any longer with the rigors of English soccer and
hopes to continue his career in another country.
	   Two French clubs, Olympique Marseille and Monaco, have been
linked with the 34-year-old Danish international.
	   ``I am enjoying the game as much as ever but it is getting
harder to keep pace,'' Schmeichel told a news conference at Old
Trafford. ``I need to train more than I have ever had to. And in
order to prepare myself properly, I need more time between games
than I can get in England.
	   ``I certainly need more than 12 days' summer holiday.
Unfortunately, the demands of the game here mean that I cannot get
the time I need, which is something I truly regret.''
	   Despite speculation about a move to France, Schmeichel insisted
he hasn't yet decided on his post-United future.
	   ``It is important that I am now allowed to concentrate totally
on playing for United,'' he said. ``I have had a fantastic career
with United and I owe it to the club, players and fans to do
everything I can to finish on a successful note.''
	   Marseille seems a logical next stop for Schmeichel. On
Wednesday, German 'keeper Andreas Koepke announced he was quitting
the French club amid speculation of a move to Glasgow Rangers.
	   Schmeichel, who joined United from Danish side Brondby in 1991,
has played a key role in making United the most successful English
club of the 1990s.
	   He has helped the Red Devils win four Premier League
championships in the last six years, two FA Cups and the League
Cup. Last February against Derby, he became the first goalkeeper to
register 100 shutouts in the Premiership.
	   ``Peter Schmeichel has been a major player in the success
achieved by Manchester United over the past eight years,'' manager
Alex Ferguson said Thursday. ```He has been a model professional
who has inspired and influenced everyone with Manchester United.
	   ``It is his professional attitude that has led him to make this
decision and while I know it has been a difficult for Peter to
make, I respect and fully support him.''
	   Schmeichel, who has made more than 300 appearances for United,
has been under increased scrutiny this season because of his age,
injuries and crucial blunders.
	   The Dane's mistake in the last minute of United's Champions
League game against Bayern Munich in September cost the club a
victory.
	   Schmeichel, who turns 35 next week, has also been dogged by
injuries recently and has missed two games this season with back
trouble.
	   United has been reportedly searching for a successor to
Schmeichel and has been consistently linked with Aston Villa's
Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich.
	   Schmeichel's current backup at United is 35-year-old Dutch
'keeper Raimond van der Gouw. United's other 'keeper is 20-year-old
Nicky Culkin, who has yet to play a League match for the senior
side.
	   Schmeichel, the starting 'keeper for Denmark during the World
Cup in France, has been capped a national record 107 times, three
more times than Michael Laudrup.

Space chief says Russia would like to extend Mir's life
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VLADIMIR ISACHENKOV &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia still hopes to find enough money to extend
the life of the Mir, but has agreed to spend its scarce funds on
the new International Space Station, the country's space chief said
Thursday.
	   Russia is to launch the first leg of the new station on Nov. 20,
and the U.S. space agency NASA, a partner in the venture, wants
Russia to abandon the 12-year old Mir space station and devote its
meager resources to the new project.
	   ``The question is whether the country is able to raise funds to
continue both projects, and I think we should find this money,''
Yuri Koptev, head of the Russian Space Agency, said at a news
conference.
	   Koptev agreed that the new station should be the priority, but
voiced hope that the Mir could stay aloft for up to two years
longer than currently planned. As of now, it is to be abandoned
around the middle of next year.
	   ``If we find money, I think we will reach an agreement with our
partners,'' he said. ``They don't consider Mir an obstacle, they
are simply concerned about our lack of resources.''
	   The final decision on Mir's fate is expected in late December
when the government comes up with budget estimates for the next
year, Koptev said.
	   Koptev spoke at the Cabinet session on Thursday to ask for
funding that would allow his agency to fulfill its obligations with
the new space station.
	   Russia's has repeatedly failed to meet deadlines for
constructing segments of the station, putting the entire project a
year behind schedule.
	   Sixteen countries are taking part in the station, which is
expected to cost at least dlrs 40 billion. The station will serve
as an orbital home for visiting astronauts and cosmonauts for up to
20 years.
	   After several delays, the launch of the station's first segment,
the 24-ton Zarya cargo module, built by Russia's Khrunichev company
under contract with the U.S. company Boeing, is scheduled for Nov.
20.
	   NASA is to follow up next month with an American-built
passageway. The Russians are building the module that house the
first crew, but it is expected to go up until the middle of next
year at the earliest.
	   Koptev strongly pushed the government for more funds, saying
that the U.S. and other participants in the project were already
exasperated with Russia's delays.
	   ``Every year of delay costs Americans 2 billion dollars,''
Koptev said.
	   Koptev stressed that the beleaguered space industry would only
be able to stay afloat thanks to the new station, that would allow
Russia to keep up to 80,000 jobs over the next 15 years.
	   ``If we quit the project, that will leave us without a future,''
Koptev said. ``That would mean that our space industry would die
within two or three years.''

Report: Singapore's Malays worst hit by economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ The economic crisis has hurt the Malay
community proportionally harder than any other ethnic group in
Singapore, a newspaper reported Thursday, revealing a potential
crack in this tightly knit society.
	   The government said earlier this week that more than 20,000
workers were laid off in the first nine months of this year. A
report in The Straits Times said 20 percent of those laid off are
ethnic Malays, even though they form only 11 percent of Singapore's
work force.
	   The data provided by Mendaki, a government-linked Malay
self-help organization, also showed that 70 percent of Malay
workers have only secondary education or below.
	   The government in this affluent island state has launched a
number of programs to fight the crisis, but their success would
depend largely on Singapore retaining its multi-ethnic cohesion.
	   About 78 percent of Singapore's 3.1 million people are of
Chinese descent, 14 percent are ethnic Malays and 7 percent ethnic
Indians.
	   Though the ruling People's Action Party, in power for 40 years,
has prided itself on achieving a harmonious multi-racial and
multi-religious society, differences still exist. Few Singaporeans
marry outside their ethnic group, and minorities do less well
professionally that the dominant Chinese group.
	   According to the official survey for 1995, Malays account for
less than 1.5 percent of Singapore's legislators, senior officials
and managers, and about 3 percent of all professionals.
	   The government has initiated several programs to retrain Malays
who have lost their jobs, and will even air a television serial on
transforming low-skilled Malays into more valuable workers.
	   Singapore leaders have repeatedly said only highly skilled,
educated workers can lead the small state out of the crisis.
	   Malays are the main racial group in neighboring Malaysia.
	   Singapore and Malaysia were briefly joined in a federation in
1963, but went their separate ways two years later after ethnically
charged riots in Singapore pitted local Malays against the Chinese.

EU seeks to ban four antibiotics from animal feed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) _ The European Commission, citing public
health concerns, on Thursday proposed banning four antibiotics used
in animal feed, to boost growth in pigs, poultry and other animals.
	   European Union spokesman Gerard Kiely said ban would affect
trade in the four products valued at ``hundreds of millions'' of
dollars a year.
	   The ban proposal stemmed from fear that the antibiotics could
raise human resistance to medicines related to those used for
animals, Kiely said.
	   ``In the Netherlands the same resistant bacteria have been found
in a poultry farmer and in his poultry,'' he said.
	   EU farmers and the pharmaceutical industry are likely to object
to the proposal to ban four antibiotics and review the four others
that EU member nations can use as growth promoters in animal feed.
	   Sweden has asked _ and has been granted the right _ to ban all
eight and Finland and Denmark already prohibit several.
	   A panel of animal nutrition experts from the 15 EU nations is
reviewing the proposal and is to vote on the ban by December. If a
majority does not back the ban, the measure goes to EU agriculture
ministers for a decision.
	   If passed, the ban would take effect Jan. 1. It would not affect
imports, since those antibiotics are not known to be used in
imported feed, Kiely said.
	   In the past decade, the EU has banned 15 antibiotics for public
health reasons.
	   The European Commission, the EU executive body, is recommending
a ban on:
	   Bacitracin Zinc, made by Alpharma AS of Norway; Spiramycin, made
by Rhone-Poulenc SA of France; Virginiamycin, made by Pfizer Inc.
of the United States; and Tylosin phosphate, made by Elanco of the
United States, a unit of U.S.-based Eli Lilly and Co.

Eleven killed by floods in western Ukraine
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ The death toll in floods in western Ukraine
has risen to 11, and bad weather is hampering efforts to quickly
repair the damages, officials said Thursday.
	   A total of 230 people have been hospitalized, but doctors said
many more of the 300,000 people affected by the disaster are in
danger of catching infections because a third of the drinking water
supply in the Zakarpattia region has been polluted by the floods.
	   Heavy rains inundated at least 118 towns and villages in
Zakarpattia last week, but repairs have been difficult because of
fresh downpours in the last few days. The flooded area is just
across Ukraine's western border from Slovakia and Hungary.
	   More than 9,500 emergency workers were sent to the region, where
about 21,500 houses have been flooded and hundreds of buildings
destroyed together with bridges, dams, roads and railways, the
Emergencies Ministry said.
	   The Ukrainian government has appealed to the United Nations, the
European Union and individual countries for help. Hungary, Slovenia
and Kazakstan have already promised aid, according to Cabinet
officials.
	   Ukraine's government has allocated 10 million hryvna (dlrs 2.9
million) for the relief effort following orders from President
Leonid Kuchma, who visited the region last week.
	   No official estimates of the losses incurred by the floods have
been provided so far.
	   Rains in Zakarpattia are expected to continue for several days,
the Ukrainian Meteorological Center said.

Singapore's Creative Technology to implement creative bonus plan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SINGAPORE (AP) _ With the government signaling that wages and
pension payments will be slashed, Singapore's homegrown business
star Creative Technology said Thursday it will compensate its
employees by returning cuts in the form of bonuses.
	   The world's leading PC sound card maker will create a bonus plan
to return potentially all of the planned 50 percent reduction in
employers' contributions to the mandatory state-run pension fund.
	   The reaction to the government-orchestrated wage and pension
cuts from one of Singapore's highest profile businesses was a
surprise.
	   While the company supports recent recommendations to reduce
business costs in Singapore, ``we are also mindful of the past and
ongoing contributions of our staff who _ during the last year _
have helped Creative weather difficult business conditions and
prosper,'' said chief executive officer Sim Wong Hoo.
	   The multimedia component maker said its response to a
government-convened committee's recommendations to halve company
contributions to the Central Provident Fund from 20 percent of a
worker's salary to 10 percent would be the ``Creative CPF Bonus
Plan.''
	   The special bonus will be paid after the current fiscal year
ends June 30, 1999, though it will depend on the company meeting
its targets.
	   ``Rewarding and further motivating this staff is crucial to
Creative because, as a world class, knowledge-based company, we
believe we stand to gain enormously from a highly motivated work
force,'' said Sim, who steered his company from a small start-up
enterprise into one of the world's most successful computer product
innovators.
	   Creative's annual wage costs in Singapore are about 50 million
Singapore dollars (dlrs 30 million). The company employs between
1,500 and 2,000 workers depending on seasonal demand.

Last surviving member of 'Comedian Harmonists' dies at 97
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BERLIN (AP) _ Roman Cycowski, the last surviving member of the
Comedian Harmonists, a legendary vocal group from the 1920s and
'30s that was forced apart by the Nazis, has died at age 97.
	   Cycowski died Monday at his home in Palm Springs, California,
the group's original record company, EMI Electrola, announced
Thursday in Cologne.
	   Cycowski was born Jan. 25, 1901, in Lodz, which belonged then to
Russia but now is part of Poland.
	   He came to Germany after World War I and began a singing career
in theaters and choirs in Berlin before joining with five other
young singers to form the Comedian Harmonists.
	   Their distinctive, mainly a cappella sound became an overnight
sensation. The group made more than a dozen films and sold millions
of records from 1927 to 1935.
	   Hits like ``Mein kleiner gruener Kaktus'' (My Little Green
Cactus) and ``Wochenend und Sonnenschein'' (Weekend and Sunshine)
remain standards in German-speaking countries.
	   But they began facing problems after the Nazis came to power in
1933 because three of the Comedian Harmonists, including Cycowski,
were Jewish.
	   The group began losing engagements because Jews were
increasingly banned from professions, including appearing on stage.
The Nazis included the sextet's music under their label of
``degenerate art.''
	   The Comedian Harmonists went on a world tour in late 1934,
including a stop in New York. By the time they returned home, the
Nazis no longer allowed them on stage at all, and they decided to
disband.
	   The non-Jewish members continued to perform in Germany, but
never came near the success of the original lineup. The Jewish
members eventually emigrated.
	   ``If we hadn't been forced to break up, we'd be bigger than the
Beatles today,'' Cycowski said in an interview a few years ago.
	   Cycowski went to Los Angeles in 1941 with his wife, Mary. After
the war, he discovered most of his relatives had been killed at
Auschwitz.
	   In 1947 he became a cantor at the Beth-Israel Temple in San
Francisco, where he sang for 25 years.
	   A prize-winning film about the group by Joseph Vilsmaier was one
of the few homegrown box office hits last year in Germany.
	   Last March, Cycowski accepted a German record prize on behalf of
the original group.
	   He is survived by his wife of 73 years. No information on
funeral arrangements was immediately available.

Germany to stress human rights with China
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's new government will raise human
rights concerns with China more openly than the previous
administration, a senior official said in an interview published
Thursday.
	   Guenter Verheugen, a deputy foreign minister, said the approach
would be part of a greater emphasis on human rights in German
diplomacy by the center-left coalition that won September
elections.
	   ``The idea that one can't talk with China about human rights
because that would threaten business is absolutely unfounded,'' he
told the Rheinische Post newspaper.
	   ``Leading German business executives tell me the Chinese respect
us more if we talk clearly about what we don't like than if we
quietly put up with it.''
	   Human rights will be ``a visible part of the program'' during
future visits by German leaders, Verheugen said.
	   Pressure groups and politicians on the left _ then in the
opposition _ regularly accused former Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
putting business ahead of human rights in dealing with China.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ After ratifying the latest peace accord with

Jerusalem claimed by the Palestinians as a future capital.
	   Palestinian negotiators denounced the construction plans, as
well as a decision by Israel's Cabinet to attach a series of

demanded the United States intervene.

supervise implementation of the land-for-security agreement. His
first stop is a meeting Friday with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
	   ``It is now crucial to have the American side join us ... to
oversee implementation of the agreement,'' Palestinian negotiator
Saeb Erekat said. ``We will not accept any post-agreement
negotiations.''
	   Still, Arafat was pleased when Israel approved the accord after
two weeks of delay. Arafat broke into a huge smile and gave a
thumbs up when his aides told him of the Cabinet vote late
Wednesday, said Jerusalem Post editor Jeff Barak, who was attending
a briefing with Arafat at the time.
	   Israel is to withdraw gradually from 13 percent of the West Bank
by the end of January, in exchange for a Palestinian crackdown on
Islamic militants.
	   In a first stage, Israel is to withdraw from 2 percent of the
West Bank on Monday. However, Israeli officials said the withdrawal
would be delayed until the end of next week, following a
parliamentary vote scheduled on Tuesday.
	   The accord has wide bipartisan support in the Knesset, unlike in
the Cabinet where it was approved by only eight of 17 Cabinet
ministers, with four opposed. Five ministers, all members of
Netanyahu's Likud Party, abstained.
	   On Thursday, there were signs that the accord was being
implemented. Israeli and Palestinian officials practiced checking
arriving passengers at a Palestinian airfield, which the agreement
allows in the Gaza Strip. Israeli officials watched as Palestinians
checked luggage and passports at the site, to be open next week.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of settlers staged a protest rally, with
many speakers calling for Netanyahu's ouster.
	   In an attempt to blunt the criticism, the government on Thursday
published bids for the construction of 1,025 homes in what is to be
a large Jewish neighborhood, Har Homa, in traditionally Arab east
Jerusalem. Eventually, 6,500 apartments are to be built in Har
Homa, known in Arabic as Jabal Abu Ghneim.
	   Arafat adviser Ahmed Tibi warned of a ``serious response'' if
construction actually begins. In March 1997, when Israel broke
ground for Har Homa, the Palestinians suspended all contacts with
Israel.
	   In ratifying the agreement, the Cabinet threatened to annex
parts of the West Bank if Arafat carries out a plan to declare
independence on May 4, the end of the five-year autonomy period.
	   In his meeting with Barak and other Israeli journalists, Arafat
signaled he was not seeking a confrontation. ``May 4 is the end of
the five-year period we agreed upon in Oslo. If there are other
ideas, I'm ready to listen,'' Arafat was quoted as saying.
	   The Palestinian leader also appeared ready to bend on another
issue, the procedure for annulling clauses of the PLO founding
charter that call for Israel's destruction.
	   Israel stipulated Wednesday that the clauses could only be
revoked by a formal vote of the PNC, while the Palestinians have
maintained that their April 1996 voice vote was sufficient.
	   ``Has the Knesset ever voted twice on an issue?'' Arafat asked
rhetorically when asked by the Israeli reporters about the PNC
vote. However, he added: ``If it is necessary, we will do it.''

<TEXT>
	   YANGON, Myanmar (AP) _ A Chinese company has signed a contract
to supply the government with heavy machinery worth dlrs 10 million
dollars for a hydropower project in central Myanmar, the state-run
press reported Thursday.
	   Under the contract, signed Wednesday, Yunnan Machinery and
Equipment will provide machinery, equipment and spare parts for the
construction of the Paunglaung underground hydropower station.
	   The project will be able to generate 280 megawatts when
completed, said a report in the New Light of Myanmar.
	   Last month, the Chinese company signed a dlrs 160 million dollar
contract with the Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise, a state
company. Under that deal, the company will provide machinery and
equipment as well as the design of an underground tunnel.
	   Myanmar is also called Burma.

England names one-day squad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ England Cricket Board selectors included two
uncapped players in a 23-man squad for the limited-overs series
against Australia and Sri Lanka starting in Australia in January.
	   Gloucestershire captain Mark Alleyne and Leicestershire's Vince
Wells, both recognized domestic limited-overs players, were the
only uncapped players in the squad announced Thursday.
	   The squad will be cut to 18 in early December but is expected to
contain the bulk of players already in Australia for the Ashes
tour.
	   ECB chairman of selectors David Graveney said the preliminary
squad was announced early to allow fringe players to prepare for a
possible call-up.
	   ``This squad covers all options as it contains several
all-rounders capable of batting high in the order,'' he said.
	   Graveny said Lancashire wicketkeeper Warren Hegg had been
selected as a possible backstop for captain Alec Stewart, who faces
a demanding Ashes tour schedule and has recurring back problems.
	   Although, Graveney said there was a possibility of using a
part-time wicketkeeper, such as John Crawley, if needed.
	   Squad: Alec Stewart, Mark Alleyne, Mike Atherton, Ian Austin,
Douglas Brown, John Crawley, Robert Croft, Mark Ealham, Neil
Fairbrother, Matthew Fleming, Angus Fraser, Ashley Giles, Darren
Gough, Dean Headley, Warren Hegg, Graeme Hick, Adam Hollioake, Ben
Hollioake, Nic Knight, Peter Martin, Alan Mullally, Graham Thorpe,
Vincent Wells.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb civilians detained dozens of
Albanians on Thursday, threatening to kill some of them unless two
Serbs apparently abducted by separatist guerrillas were released, a
Kosovo Albanian organization said.
	   Civilians with submachine guns stopped vehicles carrying ethnic
Albanians, demanding the release of two fellow Serbs who
disappeared Wednesday, the Kosovo Information Center said. The
center reflects the views of the main ethnic Albanian political
party in the Serbian province.
	   Up to 100 had been detained by early Thursday on a main road
near the border to Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with
Serbia.
	   Dozens of the detained Albanians were taken away to the village
of Crnac, 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Pristina. Some of
them phoned Pristina to relay their abductors' demands for the
release of the two Serbs.
	   ``If we failed to do this, they said they would kill us,'' Ismet
Haziri, one of those taken by the Serbs, was quoted by the center
as saying
	   Serb sources confirmed the abduction but said those taken were
being released.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat heading of an effort to
carry out a peace deal in Kosovo promised to ``take appropriate
steps'' after finding out exact circumstances of the abductions.
	   The detentions reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian
tensions in Kosovo even after an Oct. 12 agreement to end the
crisis.
	   The crackdown on ethnic Albanians seeking independence has left
hundreds dead and made refugees of hundreds of thousands more.

Japan's opposition to free-trade pact worries APEC officials

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Two Asian officials criticized
Japan on Thursday for opposing a proposed free-trade agreement
supported by the United States, saying Tokyo could deeply divide
Pacific Rim leaders as they meet to discuss the global economic
crisis.
	   ``Maybe a dramatic breakthrough will happen'' before leaders of
Japan, the United States and 19 other Asia-Pacific nations hold
their sixth annual summit in Malaysia next week, ``but I don't
think so,'' a South Korean official said in Kuala Lumpur. He spoke
on condition of anonymity.
	   The United States, Australia and Canada are pushing the
Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit on Tuesday and
Wednesday to finalize a pact to lift tariffs in nine sectors
covering dlrs 1.5 trillion in global trade by 2020.
	   The industries would be chemicals, forest products, medical
equipment, energy, telecommunications equipment, environmental
goods and services, gems and jewelry, fisheries and toys.
	   Tokyo says it can't accept a fixed schedule for opening its
forestry and fishing sectors, two industries that Japan's governing
party appears determined to protect on behalf of its supporters.
	   APEC's aim is free trade among the developed member nations by
2010 and developing countries by 2020.
	   On Thursday, senior APEC officials began a two-day meeting to
hash out the agenda that Cabinet ministers will approve this
weekend for the summit meeting by the 21 leaders.
	   The group adjourned late Thursday night with no agreement, and
some other countries also finding problems with some of the
sectors, officials said.
	   A senior U.S. official said they discussed the possibility of
extending deadlines for Japan and other countries to liberalize the
two contentious sectors.
	   ``There's a lot of discussion of flexibility,'' said the
official, speaking on condition that he not be identified. But he
said Washington isn't willing to permit Japan to refuse
liberalizing its fishing and forestry sectors altogether.
	   Earlier in the day, a Japanese official said Tokyo would not
budge. ``Japan won't change its position on the forestry and
fishing sectors,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
``We won't compromise, either.''
	   Japan confirmed Thursday that it was working on a plan to help
Asian nations develop their fishing and forestry industries. But a
Japanese delegate said the aid was in no way aimed at winning
support from Asian nations for Japan's insistence on retaining its
fishery and forestry tariffs.
	   U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky has accused Japan
of trying to derail the pact, saying it would fall apart unless the
world's second-largest economy approved all nine sectors.
	   The South Korean APEC delegate said his government supports the
free-trade agreement, but could have trouble selling it back home
if Japan refuses to open its fishing market. South Korea, one of
worst victims of the Asian economic crisis, relies as heavily on
fishing as Japan does, and its fishermen often share the same
waters.
	   The official said other countries in the region that support the
pact could end up in arguments over its nine sectors during the
APEC summit, given how much their countries already are suffering
under Asia's 16-month-old financial crisis.
	   Australian Trade Minister Tim Fischer warned Thursday that
Japan's approach could unleash protectionist forces. ``I think the
threat of slippage with regard to trade worldwide is very real,''
Fischer said in Canberra, Australia. ``I think that would be a
disastrous course, which would merely extend the present economic
difficulties.''
	   After the APEC summit, U.S. President Bill Clinton plans to
travel to Tokyo to meet with Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi.
	   Just like last year's APEC summit in Vancouver, Canada, the
discussions in Malaysia will be dominated by a financial crisis,
which also has hurt Russia and is threatening Latin America.
	   The United States has battled to keep the APEC response to the
crisis on the free-market road that the International Monetary Fund
has been urging countries to pursue.
	   However, this year's host, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad, is expected to lead a counter assault on this free-market
philosophy, arguing that the IMF prescription has failed to halt
the crisis and has instead left many countries in deep recessions
with little prospect of an early recovery.
	   Mahathir would like an endorsement of Malaysia's approach, which
imposed currency controls to keep speculators away from its
financial markets.
	   ``We hope we'll decide what needs to be done on currency
trading,'' Mahathir told reporters Thursday.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Residents of bombed Northern Ireland town get Red Cross award
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The British Red Cross on Thursday presented a
special community award to the people of Omagh, site of the worst
terrorist strike in Northern Ireland's 30-year conflict.
	   A car bomb planted by Irish Republican Army dissidents Aug. 15
killed 29 people and injured about 330 people in the town.
	   ``The timing of this is very important as it comes three months
after the event, when we thought the rest of the world had
forgotten,'' said David Bolton of Omagh's Health and Personal
Social Services Trust, one of several representatives accepting the
award.
	   ``It is an encouragement to the people of Omagh,'' Bolton said.
	   In presenting the award, British television personality Claire
Rayner said Omagh residents ``showed what friends, relatives and
next-door neighbors can do when they join together when faced with
such a terrible situation. They are an example to all
communities.''

Asian children quit school, face hunger as economic crisis deepens
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Bellamy comparing aid to markets and aid to
people, 7th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By THAKSINA KHAIKAEW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ More Asian children are dropping out of
school and millions face malnutrition as the regional economic
crisis attacks social progress made in previous decades, a top
UNICEF official said Thursday.
	   Carol Bellamy, executive director of the United Nations
Children's Fund, urged regional governments at the 4th ministerial
consultation on children's welfare not to let the crisis divert
attention from child health and education.
	   ``The price of inaction can be high, as the suffering of Latin
America and much of Africa in the 1980s proved,'' Bellamy said in a
speech opening the three-day meeting.
	   ``Countries in those regions endured a deeply damaging economic
crisis, but they continued to invest in social programs and they
are now reaping the benefits for it,'' Bellamy said.
	   Bellamy encouraged Asian-Pacific governments, grappling with
austerity programs to get through the financial devastation that
hit the region last year, to minimize cuts in social development
budgets.
	   The meeting is bringing together officials from 18 Asian-Pacific
countries with representatives of donor nations, private
organizations and the United Nations. They will discuss what can be
done to protect children and other vulnerable groups.
	   ``When the interests of the global financial markets are at
stake, tens of billions of dollars are readily found to bail them
out,'' Bellamy told The Associated Press.
	   ``But when it comes to the relatively modest amounts of money
for basic services in countries where the need is greatest, the
world's response is far from adequate,'' she said.
	   A UNICEF report said that malnutrition in East Asia and the
Pacific ranks third after South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. But if
China is excluded, the region moves up to second place.
	   Bellamy said that gloomy regional economic scenarios have
``potentially devastating'' consequences for children.
	   About 33 million children in the region continue to face severe
and moderate malnutrition, and the crisis is making the situation
worse.
	   Poverty remains the chief cause. But evidence shows that a lack
of access to nutritious food is still a major problem in some
countries like Indonesia and North Korea.
	   The crisis threatens to undo progress made in recent years in
protecting children from labor and exploitation. Poverty and loss
of jobs for their parents will force more children to work and
raise the risks of child abuse and neglect, the report said.
	   Primary school dropout rates are going up and access to health
care and sanitation _ already difficult in some countries _ are
expected to get worse as funding tightens up.
	   Some 1 billion people, or about 65 percent of the region's
population, lack access to adequate sanitation, the report said.
About 40,000 women die each year of pregnancy and childbirth
problems.
	   UNICEF fears that recession will increase maternal mortality
rates because families have less means to pay for hospital
services.
	   Thai Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai told the conference that the
crisis threatens hard-won gains since 1960 in getting nearly every
Thai child to finish sixth grade and in slashing the infant
mortality rate.
	   ``We cannot and must not compromise our children's well-being,''
Chuan said. ``Indeed, we cannot and must not compromise our own
future.''
	   Some 3 million Thais, about 80 percent of them women, are
expected to be unemployed by year-end.
	   The crisis also risks spreading AIDS. Many female workers laid
off their jobs, at least in Thailand, are believed to be resorting
to prostitution to support themselves and their families.

	   Houllier is the second Frenchman in sole charge of a Premier
League club, joining Arsene Wenger, who guided Arsenal to the
League and Cup double last season.
	   ``I felt over the past three or four weeks, things hadn't quite
been working out for the benefit of the club,'' Evans said at a
news conference.
	   Evans departure became inevitable after Tuesday night's
humiliating 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham in a League Cup game. That
followed last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield to Derby, leaving
the Reds in 11th place in the bottom half of the Premier League
standings.
	   To make matters worse, 18-year-old striker Michael Owen could be
out for up to a month after suffering a hamstring injury against
Spurs, and midfielder Steve McManaman is sidelined for at least six
weeks with an Achilles problem.
	   ``I feel very sorry about Roy's departure,'' Houllier said. ``I
really liked working with him. My relationship with him was fine.
	   ``It was the joint management situation which was more of a
problem for the players, the staff and the media I would certainly
have preferred to take this job in different circumstances.''
	   Houllier will face a huge challenge in trying to recapture the
glory days at Liverpool, one of the world's most famous and
decorated clubs.
	   The Reds have won a record 18 English league championships, five
FA Cups, five League Cups, four European Cups and two UEFA Cups.
But Liverpool has been eclipsed in the 1990s as England's top club
by Manchester United, league champion in four of the last six
seasons.
	   Evans took over as Liverpool manager in January 1994 after the
resignation of Graeme Souness. The only trophy won by Liverpool
during Evans' reign was the lightly regarded League Cup in 1995.
	   Speculation over Evans' position grew when the club brought in
Houllier this summer to work alongside him in the unusual
arrangement of co-manager.
	   Since going to the top of the table on Sept. 9, the Reds have
won only three games _ against Fulham in the League Cup, Kosice in
the UEFA Cup and Nottingham Forest in the Premiership.
	   Evans admitted Wednesday that the pressure was taking its toll.
	   ``The speculation has been very difficult to live with,'' he
said. ``I have done this job with honesty and integrity and seeing
the club suffer does affect me badly.''
	   Evans' departure signals the end of the ``Bill Shankly era'' at
Anfield. Shankly created a dynasty that produced a string of
successful managers such as Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish
and Ronnie Moran.
	   Evans' depature marks the fourth management shakeup in the
Premier League this season after changes at Tottenham, Newcastle
and Leeds.
	   Dalglish was fired as Newcastle boss and replaced by Ruud
Gullit, George Graham left Leeds to take over for Christian Gross
at Spurs, and David O'Leary succeeded Graham at Leeds.

Moore: WTO could be more generous to poorest countries
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ The World Trade Organization could give more
generous access terms to the poorest countries but should avoid
short cuts, former New Zealand premier Mark Moore, a candidate to
lead the trade watchdog, said Thursday.
	   The 132-member WTO ``has to look more like the world it
represents,'' Moore told reporters. Some 30 nations have
applications under consideration.
	   But countries must enter ``based on the principles of the
organization,'' he said.
	   Moore, 49, is one of four candidates to replace outgoing WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero, who will step down by the end of
April. All are facing trade ambassadors in Geneva this week.
	   A former leader of the center-left Labor Party, he was prime
minister in 1990 and remains a lawmaker and opposition foreign
affairs spokesman.
	   ``With some good management and a lot more listening we can do a
better job'' of making the case for free trade, he said. ``The
first job is to make sure we don't reverse and go backward.''
	   The leadership contest will be decided by consensus rather than
a vote and the WTO general council hopes to confirm the appointment
by the end of this year.
	   Also running are former Moroccan trade minister Hassan Abouyoub,
Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai Panitchpakdi and former
Canadian trade minister Roy Maclaren.

New York City opens tourism bureau in London
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ The Big Apple has opened up shop in the heart of
London.
	   So many British people visit New York City every year that
tourism officials opened a storefront office Thursday on Carnaby
Street _ the city's first outside the United States.
	   The office will offer help with travel planning, and information
about cultural and tourist attractions, hotels, airlines and
special events.
	   The United Kingdom is the top source for overseas visitors to
New York City, according to the tourism bureau, having sent 726,000
tourists in 1997. That was up 29 percent from 1996.
	   ``Now is the time to invest in our future,'' said Fran Reiter,
president of the tourism bureau. ``Our goal is to make it easy to
travel to our great city.''

Studies: Serious heart trouble rare from diet drugs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DALLAS (AP) _ About 10 percent of people who took the diet drugs
Redux and fen-phen have mildly leaky heart valves, but serious
heart problems are extremely rare, a new analysis concludes.
	   Experts also say the latest evidence hints that the valve
problems may gradually go away after people stop taking the drugs.
	   Redux and the chemically similar ``fen'' half of fen-phen were
pulled from drugstores a year ago under pressure from the Food and
Drug Administration because of concern that the medicines damage
heart valves.
	   At least 13 studies, most of them small, have looked into the
problem. While their results vary widely, experts say the results
in general show that serious problems are very unlikely, especially
for those who took the drugs for only a few months.
	   Dr. Robert Bonow of Northwestern University compiled the results
of the evidence so far, much of which was reported this week at a
meeting of the American Heart Association. It suggests that
problems resulting from the pills are less common than indicated in
warnings issued when the drugs were yanked from the market.
	   ``We are still struggling to understand the full implications,''
said Bonow, co-author of new valve disease guidelines issued by the
heart association and the American College of Cardiology.
	   Dr. Julius Gardin of the University of California, Irvine
examined the effects of the diet drugs in 1,473 overweight people.
Among those who took the medicines less than three months, no
unusual valve problems were seen.
	   However, among those who used the drugs more than three months,
15 percent of fen-phen patients had mild valve leakage, as did 11
percent on Redux. Just 4 percent who avoided diet drugs entirely
had leaky valves.
	   Nearly all of the damage was so slight it could be seen only on
ultrasound scans and caused no symptoms.
	   ``Frankly, we have no idea that this means anything for
patients' welfare,'' Gardin said.
	   Another comparison study, conducted by Dr. Bruce Shively of
Oregon Health Sciences University, looked at 220 people who took
Redux for an average of three months. He found that 7 percent had
mostly mild leaks in their aortic valves, compared with 3 percent
in a comparison group.
	   Shively said that condition seems to be harder to find the
longer people have been off the drugs _ suggesting the problem
gradually goes away.
	   One of the smaller studies _ a review of 89 patients by Dr.
Bruce Samuels of the Heart Center of Los Angeles _ found the most
problems: 29 percent of diet pill users had significant leaks in
their aortic valves.
	   ``The longer you took the drugs, the higher your risk,'' he
said.
	   Leaky valves are common, and most people suffer no ill effects.
Still, researchers emphasized that they simply do not know what
will happen to those whose valves were damaged by the diet drugs.
	   The heart association guidelines recommend that people who took
diet drugs be checked for heart murmurs. If no problems are found,
they should have another exam six to eight months later.

Reputed Hong Kong mob boss gets death in China
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS, UPDATES with reaction, possible record ransom &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos HK101-104 &QL; 
 &UR; By DIRK BEVERIDGE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ A reputed Hong Kong mob boss was sentenced to
death Thursday in China, ending a sensational kidnapping and
arms-smuggling case that highlighted differences in the two legal
systems while possibly setting a record for ransom payments.
	   Cheung Tze-keung, alias ``Big Spender,'' learned his fate in a
Guangzhou courthouse ringed by sharpshooters and security personnel
wearing bulletproof vests and carrying machine guns.
	   Cheung stared straight ahead, but some of his 35 accomplices
appeared nervous as they received punishments ranging from prison
to death. The reactions were shown in mainland Chinese television
footage aired late Thursday by Hong Kong stations.
	   The case riveted attention in Hong Kong, where two tycoons
reportedly were kidnapped and released only after the payment of
some U.S. dlrs 210 million in ransom.
	   Legal experts raised questions about the jurisdiction, noting
that some crimes committed in Hong Kong, which does not execute
people, were prosecuted in China as capital offenses in a trial
that had been closed to reporters.
	   The verdicts and sentences were imposed somewhat more openly,
with Chinese legal officials in Guangzhou, 100 miles (160
kilometers) north of the Hong Kong border, explaining things in a
news conference picked up by Hong Kong television. Western
journalists were kept out.
	   Cheung's case was the first high-profile cross-border trial
since Hong Kong reverted to Chinese rule from Britain last year.
	   Cheung's lawyers wanted the case transferred to Hong Kong, which
has a more open court system modeled after Britain's, but
authorities here said they had no evidence. The kidnappings were
never reported to Hong Kong police.
	   The Hong Kong Bar Association said China had every right to try
the gangsters.
	   But Hong Kong's failure to seek the return of any defendants
``may give people the false impression that the judiciary and the
rule of law in Hong Kong are somehow subordinate to those of the
rest of China, and thus indirectly cast a question mark over the
concept `one country, two systems,''' attorney Ronny Tong said on
behalf of the bar.
	   Hong Kong's secretary of security, Regina Ip, sought to play
down such concerns. Many of the crimes were allegedly plotted in
the mainland, where half of the defendants lived and where all were
arrested.
	   ``There is no question of the mainland interfering with Hong
Kong's own independent adjudicating power,'' Ip told a news
conference.
	   Cheung's gang was convicted in a string of spectacular crimes,
including the smuggling of dynamite and guns from China into Hong
Kong, seven armed robberies at Hong Kong gold stores that netted
7.4 million Hong Kong dollars (U.S. dlrs 950,000) and the theft of
277 tons of steel in Shenzhen, China, the official Chinese news
agency, Xinhua, reported.
	   One man was killed in the steel heist, Xinhua said.
	   Four of Cheung's accomplices also were sentenced to death. Two
more received death sentences that were suspended for two years,
giving them time to demonstrate good behavior that might let them
serve prison terms instead, Xinhua said.
	   The others will go to prison, some for life, Xinhua said.
	   Under Chinese law, the defendants can appeal within 10 days.
	   The most sensational charges reportedly concerned kidnappings of
two Hong Kong tycoons, identified in Hong Kong newspapers as Victor
Li, son of property magnate Li Ka-shing, and Walter Kwok, chairman
of the big developer Sun Hung Kai Properties.
	   Kidnappings in May 1996 and September 1997 _ apparently those of
Li and Kwok _ netted Cheung and his gang 1.64 billion Hong Kong
dollars (U.S. dlrs 210 million) in ransom, Xinhua said.
	   That attracted the interest of the Guinness Book of Records. The
record keepers list the world's biggest modern-day ransom as 57.5
million pounds (U.S. dollars 95.5 million at current rates) paid to
free two brothers kidnapped by left-wing guerrillas in Argentina in
1975.
	   Guinness would be interested in hearing from someone involved in
the Cheung case, spokesman Malcolm Roughead said in London.

British tourists leaving Israel due to Gulf crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   EILAT, Israel (AP) - Hundreds of British tourists began leaving
Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat Thursday as the Gulf crisis
deepened and the Israeli army opened gas mask distribution centers
for civilians.
	   The British tour operator Thomson, which had 600 customers in
Eilat, sent four flights, with room for 150 passengers each to
bring the tourists home.
	   The British Foreign Office advised British nationals to leave
Israel as the United States stepped up its preparations for the
possibility of a military strike against Iraq. ``We advise against
all non-essential travel to Israel and the Occupied Territories,''
the Foreign Office statement said.
	   The United States and Canada have issued similar travel
advisories for their citizens traveling in the area.
	   ``We just heard this morning that we should leave,'' said John
Butler, from London, as he and his wife Enid got on the bus for the
drive to the airport. ``We're very sorry. We really enjoyed it
here.''
	   The Butlers had spent ten days in Eilat and were due to leave on
Monday. Other British tour operators, Sunworld, Peltours and
Longwood, were waiting until Sunday before deciding whether to
advise the clients to leave Eilat.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israeli cities. A senior Israeli official
said Wednesday the chances of Iraq targeting Israel this time were
``close to zero.'' Nevertheless the army opened 65 gas mask
distribution centers throughout the country and planned to increase
that number to 150.
	   ``As long as there is any possibility at all, we have to be
prepared,'' said David Bar-Illan, an adviser to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.

Kopke demands transfer from Marseille
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MARSEILLE, France (AP) _ Andreas Kopke, Marseille's German
international goalkeeper, has asked for a transfer from the French
league leader, according to French press reports Thursday.
	   Kopke, 35, told French sports daily L'Equipe that he is unhappy
with coach Rolland Courbis' policy of rotating the goalkeeping
position with Stephane Porato.
	   ``It's an unbearable situation. I want to leave Marseille and
find another club as quickly as possible,'' Kopke was quoted as
saying.
	   ``Relations with Rolland Courbis are becoming unacceptable for
me,'' said the goalkeeper, who joined Marseille from Eintracht
Frankfurt in 1996.
	   Kopke got no assurances from Courbis that he would play more
often.
	   ``I am sorry, but I still cannot say that Andreas is better than
Porato. On the contrary I think the balance is in favor of
Porato,'' Courbis was quoted as saying in L'Equipe.

Poland will advocate Slovakia's integration with NATO, EU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   WARSAW, Poland (AP) _ Polish leaders assured Slovakia's new
prime minister on Thursday they would actively support his
country's aspirations to join European economic and military
organizations.
	   Mikulas Dzurinda is on a one-day visit to Warsaw, his second
foreign trip since his government replaced the authoritarian regime
of Vladimir Meciar on Oct. 30.
	   ``Poland is becoming a driving force for the integration efforts
of central European nations, and our priority is to integrate with
the European Union and with NATO,'' Dzurinda said, explaining why
he chose to visit Warsaw at the start of his term.
	   Polish Prime Minister Jerzy Buzek said he was happy to meet
Dzurinda at a time when Slovakia, Poland's large southern neighbor,
is orienting itself toward democracy, a free market, European
integration and respect for human rights.
	   ``It is Poland's strong intention to see Slovakia in the EU and
in NATO as soon as possible because Europe can be peaceful and
stable only when all its countries are democratic, have market
economy and respect the law and human rights,'' Buzek said.
	   Dzurinda and Buzek held very ``concrete'' talks on developing
political and economic cooperation within central Europe, as well
as items such as border controls and improving transportation and
communication.
	   Dzurinda was also to meet with President Aleksander Kwasniewski
and Parliament Speaker Maciej Plazynski.

Japan's ruling party unveils new economic stimulus package
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party presented its latest recession
rescue blueprint Thursday, but the stimulus package _ Japan's
largest ever _ failed to lift gloom among business leaders and
economists.
	   As Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi prepares to meet U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Asian leaders at an economic forum in Malaysia
this weekend, Japan has been pressured to show initiative in
halting its economic slide and leading the region out of crisis.
	   Instead of hope, however, Thursday's 18 trillion yen (dlrs 147
billion) tax cut and spending proposal was greeted by a sharp fall
in Tokyo's main stock index, skepticism among economic analysts,
and widespread indifference on local news broadcasts.
	   ``There is a feeling of slight disappointment,'' said Masaaki
Higashida, deputy general manager of investment information and
services at Nomura Securities. ``The package didn't go beyond what
was already known.''
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's proposal calls for 10
trillion yen (dlrs 81 billion) in public works-related spending
through next March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income
tax cuts next year. Another 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) was
expected in corporate tax cuts and other tax relief measures.
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi Sakaiya,
said Thursday that the government plan will likely include a mix of
tax cuts worth about 7 trillion yen (dlrs 57 billion).
	   The widely expected package was compiled in a bid to prevent
Japan's economy from shrinking for a third consecutive year and to
fulfill Obuchi's pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   The plan will form the basis of an official government plan to
be formally announced Monday and expected to be passed later this
month in a special session of Parliament.
	   Kyodo News agency quoted several private industry leaders as
grumbling about the package, saying it would simply slow the pace
of Japan's economic downturn rather than usher in growth.
	   The government has been prodded both at home and abroad to do
more to deal with record unemployment, soaring bankruptcies and
deeply shaken consumer confidence.
	   On Tuesday, President Clinton singled out Japan as the key to
reviving economic growth in Asia and pulling the region out of the
financial crisis that is beginning to be felt on American soil.
	   ``The restoration of growth in Japan, which has been stalled now
for more than five years, is absolutely essential to the
restoration of growth in the rest of Asia,'' Clinton said. ``The
rest of us look to Japan to move quickly.''
	   Irritation with Japan was already brewing Thursday among
officials at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia, where Obuchi will travel this weekend.
	   Asian delegates slammed Japan's opposition to a proposed
free-trade agreement, saying it could sow discord just as the
leaders were trying to achieve consensus on strategies to restore
prosperity to the troubled region.
	   Investors in Japan expressed dissatisfaction with the
government's stimulus plan. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index
fell 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent, to 14,075.06.
	   Japan officially estimates gross domestic product will contract
by 1.8 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999. The
economy shrank 0.7 percent last year.
	   The proposals announced Thursday for a supplementary budget, the
third such appropriation measure so far this year, also include
reducing the effective Japanese corporate tax rate to 40 percent in
the fiscal year starting next April, from the current rate of about
46 percent.
	   The ruling party also called for consideration of tax incentives
to stimulate housing demand and private investment.
	   One idea aimed at getting consumers to spend more, instead of
saving more, is the distribution of government-issued shopping
coupons worth about 20,000 yen (dlrs 163) to the elderly and
families with young children.

Seven suspected Kosovo rebels sentenced to prison
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ A district court in Kosovo sentenced
seven ethnic Albanians to prison for ``conspiracy against the
state,'' state-run Tanjug news agency reported Thursday.
	   The seven, all from the village of Rudica near Klina, 45
kilometers (28 miles) west of provincial capital Pristina, were
charged with membership in the secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army.
	   Saban Mehmetaj and Gani Ahmetdjekaj were handed 4 1/2 year
prison terms each, while Mustafa Mehmetaj got 2 1/2 years
imprisonment for organizing ``terrorist activities'' in their
village, including forming a KLA unit in July. They also collected
a sum equivalent to dlrs. 3,800, intended for procuring arms and
ammunition.
	   The other four received two-year sentences each, on charges of
belonging to the KLA, which is fighting for independence from
Serbia, a republic in Yugoslavia.
	   The seven were arrested while attempting to illegally cross the
border between Kosovo and neighboring Albanian .

 &UR; Eds: combines previous; Updates with Phil Thompson appointed
 &UR; Evans quits as Liverpool boss, leaving Houllier in charge

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Roy Evans stepped down as co-manager
of Liverpool on Thursday, leaving Frenchman Gerard Houllier in sole
charge of the struggling Premier League club.
	   Liverpool chairman David Moores said Evans, who has been with
the club for 33 years as a player, coach and manager, was leaving
by ``mutual consent.''
	   ``I felt over the past three or four weeks, things hadn't quite
been working out for the benefit of the club,'' Evans said at a
news conference. ``That was always uppermost in my mind. I dispute
my record is one of failure. At any other club it would be a
success but not at Liverpool.''
	   Evans declined an offer to accept another position with
Liverpool, saying he didn't want to be ``a ghost on the wall.''
	   ``If we're going to give Gerard and this team a chance, you have
to walk away,'' he said.
	   The move leaves Houllier, the former French national coach and
technical director, in charge for Saturday's home game against
Leeds.
	   Houllier becomes the first foreigner to have full control at
Anfield in the club's 106-year history. He is expected to bring in
fellow Frenchman Patrice Bergues, a Liverpool coach, as his
assistant.
	   Houllier is the second Frenchman in sole charge of a Premier
League club, joining Arsene Wenger, who guided Arsenal to the
League and Cup double last season.
	   Liverpool also announced that Evans' assistant, Doug Gilmore,
was leaving the club. He will be replaced by former Liverpool hero
Phil Thompson.
	   Thompson, who captained Liverpool to a European Cup victory in
1981, was fired from Liverpool's coaching staff by former boss
Graeme Souness in 1992. He has since worked as a commentator for
BSkyB television and Liverpool newspapers.
	   Evans departure became inevitable after Tuesday night's
humiliating 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham in a League Cup game. That
followed last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield to Derby, leaving
the Reds in 11th place in the bottom half of the Premier League
standings.
	   To make matters worse, 18-year-old striker Michael Owen could be
out for up to a month after suffering a hamstring injury against
Spurs, and midfielder Steve McManaman is sidelined for at least six
weeks with an Achilles problem.
	   ``I feel very sorry about Roy's departure,'' Houllier said. ``I
really liked working with him. My relationship with him was fine.
	   ``It was the joint management situation which was more of a
problem for the players, the staff and the media I would certainly
have preferred to take this job in different circumstances.''
	   Houllier will face a huge challenge in trying to recapture the
glory days at Liverpool, one of the world's most famous and
decorated clubs.
	   The Reds have won a record 18 English league championships, five
FA Cups, five League Cups, four European Cups and two UEFA Cups.
But Liverpool has been eclipsed in the 1990s as England's top club
by Manchester United, league champion in four of the last six
seasons.
	   ``It's a massive, massive club, the most successful club in
England, and we want to get it back to that state,'' Moores said.
	   Evans took over as Liverpool manager in January 1994 after the
resignation of Graeme Souness. The only trophy won by Liverpool
during Evans' reign was the lightly regarded League Cup in 1995.
	   Speculation over Evans' position grew when the club brought in
Houllier this summer to work alongside him in the unusual
arrangement of co-manager.
	   Since going to the top of the table on Sept. 9, the Reds have
won only three games _ against Fulham in the League Cup, Kosice in
the UEFA Cup and Nottingham Forest in the Premiership.
	   Evans admitted Wednesday that the pressure was taking its toll.
	   ``The speculation has been very difficult to live with,'' he
said. ``I have done this job with honesty and integrity and seeing
the club suffer does affect me badly.''
	   Evans' departure signals the end of the ``Bill Shankly era'' at
Anfield. Shankly created a dynasty that produced a string of
successful managers such as Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish
and Ronnie Moran.
	   Evans' departure marks the fourth management shakeup in the
Premier League this season after changes at Tottenham, Newcastle
and Leeds.
	   Dalglish was fired as Newcastle boss and replaced by Ruud
Gullit, George Graham left Leeds to take over for Christian Gross
at Spurs, and David O'Leary succeeded Graham at Leeds.

Satellites may be affected by shower of space crumbs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ A rare storm of dust-sized ``comet
crumbs,'' seen only once every 33 years, could pose a threat to
hundreds of satellites circling Earth next week, scientists said
Thursday.
	   The phenomenon known as a Leonids storm will occur early next
Wednesday, and astronomers predict it will be the most spectacular
display of its kind for a century.
	   The storm occurs when Earth passes through the tail of Comet
Tempel Tuttle. The particles trailing the comet are called Leonids
because the comet has a 33-year orbit of the constellation Leo.
	   Thousands of Leonids will enter the Earth's atmosphere during
next week's storm but they won't pose a threat to Earth itself
because they burn up in the atmosphere, giving the impression of a
brilliant shower of stars.
	   ``It just looks like every star in the sky is falling down on
you,'' said Lt. Van Culver, a U.S. Air Force satellite systems
engineer at the joint U.S.-Australian defense facility at
Nurrungar, in the Outback of South Australia state.
	   ``They (astronomers) are expecting a big one and this is the
last one they are expecting to be substantial until several more
33-year cycles.''
	   But scientists warn the particles could endanger about 400
satellites circling the planet.
	   Australian and U.S. military staff at the Nurrungar base, about
250 miles (400 kilometers) north of the state capital Adelaide,
have prepared contingency plans in case one of their defense
satellites is damaged.
	   Culver said the chance of damage to a satellite was remote
because the Leonids were so small: the likelihood of one greater
than the thickness of a paperclip striking a satellite is less than
0.1 percent.
	   But the particles will discharge plasma that may cause
electronic disturbance.
	   ``These things are like predicting the weather; we really don't
know,'' Culver said.
	   ``We've been training for it and we have developed some
contingency plans for some of the most probable anomalies.''
	   While scientists will be monitoring their satellites during the
space storm, Culver said they would also take advantage of the
clear skies in their remote location to view the spectacle for
themselves.
	   The storm is expected to occur between 5:11 a.m. and 7:11 a.m.
local time (1745 and 1945 GMT) Wednesday.
	   Residents in the northwest of Australia are expected to have the
best view of the Leonids storm, while the best view of the
phenomenon in the world will be from Mongolia.
	   ``Evidently, back in 1833, it was so impressive people thought
the end of the world was here,'' Culver said.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Arnaud Clement of France is heading to his first
career semifinal after defeating Sebastian Lareau of Canada in the
quarterfinals of the dlrs 1.1 million Kremlin Cup tennis tournament
Thursday.
	   Twenty-year-old Clement held his serve and didn't allow Lareau a
single break point.
	   Lareau, a Canadian doubles specialist, wasn't serving as
consistently as he did Wednesday _ when he upset top-seeded Alex
Corretja _ and he double-faulted six times.
	   Clement broke the Canadian in the eighth game of the first set
to win it 6-3. He served for the match in the final game when it
came to a deuce, but he fired an ace and closed the set 7-5 and win
the match.
	   ``When I came here I didn't expect to reach the semifinal,''
Clement told reporters.

German police plan mass DNA test in hunt for killer
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PEINE, Germany (AP) _ Police seeking the murderer of a
13-year-old boy called Thursday on 2,100 men living in his
neighborhood to submit to a voluntary DNA test.
	   The dismembered body of Markus Wachtel was found in a gravel pit
March 10 in Stederdorf, a section of the city of Peine in Lower
Saxony state where the boy lived.
	   Police were able to isolate a trace of DNA on his corpse that
they believe came from the killer, and hope to match it to someone
living in the area. About 2,100 men living in the neighborhood have
been asked to report to a school this weekend to give a saliva
sample.
	   The killer comes ``with great probability from Stederdorf,''
police spokesman Klaus Buhlmann said.
	   Early this year, police investigating the killing of an
11-year-old girl in Cloppenburg, near the Dutch border, took saliva
samples from 16,400 local men for DNA testing _ the largest mass
genetic test to date.
	   A local man was arrested after his DNA sample implicated him and
he later confessed to two killings.

	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Horns blared across Romania Thursday,
as thousands of drivers vented their frustration over falling
living standards and new taxes. It was the second nationwide
demonstration in a row of dissatisfaction over government policies.
	   In Bucharest, Prime Minister Radu Vasile interrupted a Cabinet
meeting to talk with representatives of the some 600 drivers who
participated in the protest in the capital. Their cars blocked the
square near government headquarters and some adjoining boulevards.
	   Similar protests were reported in other cities.
	   On Wednesday, thousands of angry workers and students marched
through Romanian cities.
	   Since reformist parties came to power two years ago, the
coalition government has stalled on market reforms. Purchasing
power and production have dropped. Unemployment is about 8.6
percent, and salaries are often paid late.

	   NEW DELHI, India _ India asked Pakistan on Thursday to close
down training camps for separatist guerrillas in Kashmir, but
Pakistan denied it had such camps and accused India of terrorism to
destabilize the country.
	   The meeting on terrorism and drugs was one of a series of six
conferences over 10 days on some of the lesser issues aggravating
tension between India and Pakistan, whose rivalry led to May's
tit-for-tat nuclear tests.
	   Pakistan says all issues must await a solution to the dispute
over Kashmir, which it calls the heart of the problem. India
believes settling the minor disputes would create a better
atmosphere for the talks on Kashmir, which has been divided between
them since 1947.
	   India's interior secretary, B.P. Singh, admitted little progress
was made at the talks tha tend Friday, but said it was the first
time in nine years that both nations were discussing the subject.
``It is helpful because it is the beginning of a dialogue,'' Singh
said.
	   A Pakistani spokesman, who requested anonmyity, said his
delegation left disappointed that India had revived its usual
accusations. ``This left a bad taste in the mouth. It was a bitter
experience.''
	   On Wednesday night, the Indian minister in charge of internal
security, Home Minister Lal Krishna Advani, accused Pakistan of
being ``a terrorist state'' for allegedly supporting Muslim
insurgents in Kashmir, .
	   For its part, Pakistan accused India of carrying out a bombing
campaign to stem its alleged support for insurgents in Kashmir, the
Himalayan territory that both countries claim.
	   Each country denies active involvement in the other's troubles.
	   At a meeting in a palace-turned-guest house in New Delhi, Singh
said he gave Pakistani officials documents on training camps in
Pakistan and in parts of Kashmir that it controls.
	   Singh said more than 29,000 people have been killed in the last
10 years in Kashmir and Punjab because of terrorist activities that
he blamed on Pakistan.
	   ``We gave them irrefutable evidence about terrorists, training
camps,'' he said.
	   ``Their reaction was one of disbelief, then total denial,''
Singh said.
	   The Pakistani delegation asked India to let the United Nations
or other independent group monitor the frontier against
infiltration, an offer India rejects because it says it does not
want outside involvement in the dispute between it and its
neighbor.
	   Since 1989, the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir has been the scene
of a rebellion by disparate Muslim guerrilla outfits, claiming
either to seek an independent Kashmir or to merge with Pakistan
which is officially an Islamic state. India is predominantly Hindu,
but Muslims are the majority in Kashmir.

Dancer bumps, grinds protest of alleged rape by diplomat

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Gyrating in front of Israel's Foreign Ministry,
an Israeli belly dancer bedecked with bangles and beads on Thursday
protested an alleged sexual assault by an Egyptian diplomat.
	   An Israeli court threw out a criminal case against Egyptian
Ambassador Mohammad Bassiouny, after Shlomit Shalom, 32, charged
that Bassiouny tried to rape her last year, after offering her a
birthday present.
	   A civil court dismissed her dlrs 286,000 damage claim, ruling
that Bassiouny has diplomatic immunity against such charges.
	   Strutting her best stuff for Israel's sometimes stuffy
diplomats, Shalom charged that Israel's government is taking
Bassiouny's side, giving him legal assistance. She demanded that
they ask him to leave his post.
	   Bassiouny, Egypt's ambassador to Israel for 18 years, is the
longest-serving top-ranking foreign diplomat in Israel. He denies
any wrongdoing.
	   Accenting her case with a gold crown, a black, sequined dress
and heavy blue eye makeup, she drew attention to signs held by more
conventionally clad women. One read, ``There is no diplomatic
immunity for rape.''
	   Her lawyer, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, wearing a quiet business
suit, claimed Israel does not even have a diplomatic immunity law
on its books.
	   Foreign Ministry officials acknowledged that, but said the
diplomatic immunity concept is rooted in international law and has
been upheld by Israeli courts.
	   Darshan-Leitner was having none of that. She declared, ``Israel
should not sacrifice the rights of women for a diplomatic
relationship with a foreign country.'' She said Israel does not
have to break off relations with Egypt _ just ask Egypt to send
another ambassador.

Shell lays off 3,000 workers in Europe
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Royal Dutch Shell followed up last month's gloomy
assessment of the oil industry by announcing Thursday that it would
cut 3,000 jobs across Europe.
	   Specifics of where the cuts would take place were not announced,
but the oil giant said last month it planned to close big offices
that run its operations in Britain, the Netherlands, France and
Germany, leaving employees in smaller, decentralized offices to
deal directly with headquarters.
	   Shell foreshadowed the cuts in September 1997 when it unveiled
plans to shed 15 percent of the company's European work force.
	   Last month, the company predicted depressed oil prices would not
recover any time soon, with the market glutted even as the ripple
effects of the Asian economic crisis spread into other regions.
	   Profits fell 56 percent in the quarter ending Sept. 30.
	   The Anglo-Dutch oil group said it is responding by cutting out
some bureaucratic fat.
	   ``I regret that as a result of the restructuring, some people
will have to leave the organization,'' said Paul Skinner, president
of Shell Europe Oil Products. ``That's never an easy process, and
we will be giving them as much support as we can in identifying new
career opportunities outside the company.''

<TEXT>
	   DIYARBAKIR, Turkey (AP) _ Turkish military units have killed a
total of 82 Kurdish rebels in a week of clashes in the country's
southeast and in northern Iraq, the Anatolia news agency said on
Thursday.
	   The soldiers have killed 64 rebels in northern Iraq since the
start of an offensive there a week ago, the agency said.
	   In a fresh clash inside Turkey, the troops killed 18 insurgents
near this southeastern city, it added.
	   The rebels, who have been fighting for an autonomy in the
Turkey's southeast, often launch cross-border raids from hideouts
in northern Iraq.
	   Military officials did not comment on the reports, which could
not be verified independently.
	   Some 37,000 have lost their lives in the conflict since 1984.

KLM, Schiphol back plans for new airport on North Sea island
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ KLM Royal Dutch Airlines and
Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport appealed Thursday for a new airport on
a manmade island in the North Sea to allow Schiphol to keep pace
with soaring growth.
	   At a joint press conference, KLM and Schiphol directors said the
island would likely cost 35 to 40 billion guilders (dlrs 18.7 to
21.4 billion) but they revealed no construction plans.
	   KLM's Leo van Wijk and Schiphol's Gerlach Cerfontaine said the
project, jointly funded by the government and the private sector,
should be ready by 2010.
	   The airport and national carrier also urged the government to
allow growth to continue on Schiphol's current site on the
outskirts of Amsterdam.
	   Schiphol will handle a total of 380,000 takeoffs and landings
this year _ 20,000 more than last year _ and says it can grow to a
maximum of 600,000 takeoffs and landings in the future.
	   But the airport, which is striving to become one of Europe's
biggest, believes that it can accommodate up to 900,000 flights per
year in the future if it builds a new island. Previous plans have
called for six runways on the island, which would be linked to the
mainland via an undersea rail tunnel.
	   The Dutch airline pilots' association has expressed concerns
that landings and takeoffs from such an island could be dangerous,
given the fierce offshore crosswinds.
	   KLM's U.S. partner, Northwest Airlines, has said the companies'
alliance is under threat if Schiphol is not allowed to grow.
	   The Dutch government is due to make an announcement before
year's end on the future of aviation in the Netherlands.

British tourists leaving Israel due to Gulf crisis

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with tourism minister angry over departures, plans to

<TEXT>
	   EILAT, Israel (AP) - Hundreds of British tourists began leaving
Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat Thursday as the Gulf crisis
deepened and the Israeli army opened gas mask distribution centers
for civilians.
	   The British tour operator Thomson, which had 600 customers in
Eilat, sent four flights, with room for 150 passengers each to
bring the tourists home.
	   The British Foreign Office advised British nationals to leave
Israel as the United States stepped up its preparations for the
possibility of a military strike against Iraq. ``We advise against
all non-essential travel to Israel and the Occupied Territories,''
the Foreign Office statement said.
	   The United States and Canada have issued similar travel
advisories for their citizens traveling in the area.
	   ``We just heard this morning that we should leave,'' said John
Butler, from London, as he and his wife Enid got on the bus for the
drive to the airport. ``We're very sorry. We really enjoyed it
here.''
	   The Butlers had spent ten days in Eilat and were due to leave on
Monday. Other British tour operators, Sunworld, Peltours and
Longwood, were waiting until Sunday before deciding whether to
advise the clients to leave Eilat.
	   During the 1991 Gulf War, Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles with
conventional warheads at Israeli cities. A senior Israeli official
said Wednesday the chances of Iraq targeting Israel this time were
``close to zero.'' Nevertheless the army opened 65 gas mask
distribution centers throughout the country and planned to increase
that number to 150.
	   ``As long as there is any possibility at all, we have to be
prepared,'' said David Bar-Illan, an adviser to Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.
	   Israeli Tourism Minister Moshe Katsav issued an angry statement,
calling the travel advisories ``rash, harmful and superfluous.''
Noting that there was no sign that Iraq would retaliate against
Israel this time, Katsav said he would ask Israel's foreign
ministry to register official protests with the United States and
Britain over the advisories.
	   Katsav said Israel would distribute gas masks and protective
kits to tourists who remain in the country.

Honda Motor, Mazda Motor report profit gains in first half
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Honda Motor Co.'s group profit rose 25.1 percent in
the latest six months from the same period last year, while Mazda
Motor Corp. posted a fiscal first-half profit for the first time in
seven years, the companies reported Thursday.
	   The two automakers attributed their increased earnings to the
weaker yen against the dollar, which boosts their profits in yen
terms, and robust sales in North America and Europe.
	   Honda, Japan's third-largest automaker, said the company's net
profit rose to 158.28 billion yen (dlrs 1.29 billion) in the six
months ended Sept. 30 from 126.49 billion yen (dlrs 1.03 billion)
in the first half of the previous fiscal year.
	   Honda's sales rose 12.1 percent to 3.13 trillion yen (dlrs 25.68
billion) from 2.79 trillion yen (dlrs 22.91 billion).
	   Honda reported 48.0 billion yen (dlrs 262 million) in gains from
the weaker yen, which averaged 133 yen to the dollar during the
latest reporting period, sharply lower than 119 yen a year earlier.
	   Honda said its domestic sales fell 8.7 percent from a year
earlier, but overseas sales jumped 20.9 percent.
	   For the full fiscal year ending next March, Honda now expects
group net profit of 280 billion yen (dlrs 2.29 billion) on sales of
6.40 trillion yen (dlrs 52.45 billion). It earned 260.63 billion
yen (dlrs 2.13 billion) last fiscal year.
	   Meanwhile, Mazda, Japan's fifth-largest automaker, reported a
group net profit of 8.5 billion yen (dlrs 69.7 million), compared
with a loss of 9.7 billion yen (dlrs 79.5 million) in last year's
corresponding period.
	   The Hiroshima-based Mazda, 33.4 percent owned by Ford Motor Co.
of the United States, last posted a group net profit for a fiscal
first half in the period ended Sept. 30, 1991.
	   Mazda's group sales totaled 1.06 trillion yen (dlrs 8.7
billion), up 3.6 percent from 1.03 trillion yen (dlrs 8.4 billion).
	   Robert L. Shanks, managing director at Mazda, said the improved
earnings reflected the automaker's continued efforts to
restructure.
	   ``This is despite some very adverse circumstances not only in
Japan and Southeast Asia, but the rest of the world,'' Shanks said,
referring to Asia's financial turmoil.
	   Japan remains in its worst recession in decades.
	   Mazda said cost reductions and foreign exchange gains
contributed largely to the company's improved earnings.
	   Cost reductions resulted in savings of 14.00 billion yen (dlrs
114.7 million), while foreign exchange benefits added 11.00 billion
yen (dlrs 90.2 million), the company said.
	   Mazda's domestic sales fell 3.3 percent to 173,000 vehicles,
while exports dropped 2.3 percent to 263,000 vehicles. Despite the
drop in domestic sales, Mazda's market share rose to 5.8 percent
from 5.4 percent a year earlier, the company said.
	   Mazda expects to post a group net profit of 32.0 billion yen
(dlrs 262.3 million) for the full fiscal year, compared with a loss
of 6.8 billion yen (dlrs 55.7 million) in the previous year.

Estonia provides trickle of water to dry Russian border town
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TALLINN, Estonia (AP) _ Estonia allowed a trickle of drinking
water to flow into a desperate Russian border town Thursday, almost
three days after cutting off the only water supply for the town
that failed to pay a dlrs 1.2-million water bill.
	   The Estonian city of Narva has the region's main water utility,
and provides all the water used by Ivangorod, a Russian town of
12,000 people just over the border.
	   Estonia complains that nonpayment of water bills is an ongoing
problem worsened by Russia's economic crisis. Narva shut off
Ivangorod's water on Tuesday.
	   After urgent talks between Estonian Prime Minister Mart Siimann
and Russian Deputy Prime Minister Valentina Matviyenko by
telephone, Moscow promised to begin paying part of Ivangorod's
bill.
	   However, Narva officials only restored 25 percent of the Russian
city's water supply because it was not clear whether Russia would
pay the entire bill, which has run up during the past year, the
Baltic News Service reported.
	   Ivangorod had appealed to the Russian and Estonian governments
for help in ending the water crisis.
	   Ivangorod and Narva, about 200 kilometers (120 miles) east of
Tallinn, have shared a water system since before World War II, when
Ivangorod was part of Estonia. They continued to share the system
after Estonia was annexed by the Soviet Union in 1940.
	   When the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Ivangorod became part
of Russia, while Narva remained part of independent Estonia.

India tests surface-to-air missile
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ For the second time in five months,
India on Thursday tested a sea-skimming missile that can deliver
conventional explosives up to a range of 25 kilometers (15 miles),
domestic news agencies said.
	   The indigenous Trishul missile was fired from a naval base in
the southwest city of Cochin, Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
	   ``Analysis of the test firing was very encouraging,'' PTI quoted
project director A.J. Kapoor as saying.
	   The 650-kilogram (1,450-pound) missile can also be used as a
surface-to-air missile.
	   The government plans to induct Trishul, or Trident, into the
navy by the end of the decade.
	   The missile uses solid fuel and has a range of up to nine
kilometers (5.5 miles) and can carry a warhead of 15 kilograms (33
pounds). The naval version of the missile was first tested in June.
Two more tests are planned in the next few days, United News of
India news agency reported.
	   ``The current tests prove that the missile is among the best ...
of similar types,'' said Sivathanu Pillai, chief controller of the
Defense Research and Development Organization, which developed the
missile.
	   The latest test came as India and Pakistan resumed talks to
reduce tension between the two nations, which have fought three
wars over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Little progress has
been made in talks held so far.
	   India tested five underground nuclear devices May 11-13 and is
perfecting a delivery system.
	   The Indian government also has approved increasing the range of
the intermediate-range Agni missile, which it had previously
tested, but halted two years ago following pressure from the United
States.
	   India says it needs a nuclear defense against China and its
other neighbor Pakistan, both nuclear powers. India has fought
Pakistan in three wars since 1948 and still engages in frequent
border skirmishes. India and China fought a war in 1962.

Kosovo Albanians reported detained, threatened

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Armed Serb civilians detained dozens
of Albanians on Thursday and threatened to kill some of them unless
two Serbs apparently abducted by separatist guerrillas were
released, a Kosovo Albanian organization said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which reflects views of the main
Albanian political party in the Serbian province, initially said
Serb police had taken 20 Albanians off a bus coming from
Montenegro.
	   But later, the center blamed armed Serb civilians and said up to
100 had been detained by early Thursday. It said the Serbs began
stopping vehicles on Wednesday carrying Albanians on a main road
near the border to Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with
Serbia.
	   The Serbs, armed with submachine guns, were seeking the release
of two fellow Serbs who went missing Wednesday in the central
Drenica region, said the center. It said some of those detained
were threatened with ``liquidation'' unless the two Serbs were
released.
	   Dozens of the detained Albanians were taken away to the village
of Crnac, 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Pristina. Some of
them phoned Pristina to relay their abductors' demands for the
release of the two Serbs.
	   ``If we failed to do this, they said they would kill us,'' Ismet
Haziri, one of those taken by the Serbs, was quoted as saying
	   Serb sources confirmed the abduction but said those taken were
being released. One of those released, Rrahim Kadriu, said about 30
people remained in the custody of the Serbs and speculated their
captors would try to hold them until the two Serbs were freed.
	   William Walker, the American heading a still-forming
international team of Kosovo monitors, said his people would ``take
appropriate steps'' after finding out exact circumstances of the
abductions.
	   The detentions reflected the high residue of Serb-Albanian
tensions in Kosovo despite a lessening of bloodshed in the wake of
an Oct. 12 agreement ending a nearly eight-month crackdown on
Kosovo Albanian guerrillas fighting for independence. The crackdown
in the Albanian-majority Serbian province left hundreds dead _
mostly Albanian civilians _ and made refugees of hundreds of
thousands more.
	   The U.S. envoy to Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
the October agreement was taking shape, ``but we have a long way to
go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet Walker, said he would be going to
Belgrade on Friday to talk with authorities there on implementation
of the autonomy plan.
	   Walker pledged a ``robust effort'' on the part of what will be a
2,000-strong monitoring team of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe to check on authorities' pledges to scale
back troops and other provisions of the October agreement.
	   Kosovo's violence has continued past the Oct. 12 agreement by
Milosevic to sharply reduce the number of police and soldiers in
the province.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   Police accuse the rebels of attacking to try to provoke a harsh
response that could prompt world leaders to order military strikes.
	   At a memorial in the western village of Retimlje for five
comrades killed when their cars ran into a police patrol, KLA
fighters vowed revenge.
	   ``Their deaths unite us even more, and their blood gives us more
strength,'' said Sebajdin Cena, a KLA commader.

Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu comment &QL; 
 &UR; By SARI BASHI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army opened gas mask distribution
centers Thursday in preparation for a possible attack by Iraq,
though a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
the probability of Israel being targeted was ``close to zero.''
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, urged the United States to exhaust
the diplomatic option. ``I hope and urge that there will not be an
attack against Iraq,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The
Jerusalem Post. ``Peace in the Middle East will be negatively
affected by a U.S. attack.''
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with top ministers
Thursday to discuss Israeli preparedness for a possible U.S. strike
that might trigger an Iraqi attack on Israel.
	   At a news conference Thursday Netanyahu said ``a real crisis is
developing,'' between the U.S. and Iraq. Asked if he had a gas
mask, Netanyahu said ``I don't think so. I haven't checked. It's
one of the problems when you have to get one of these things out of
the closet.''
	   Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan said Israel believed chances
for an Iraqi retaliatory attack were slim but the country was
taking no chances.
	   ``We feel that the chances of any kind of attack are ... close
to zero, but as long as there is any possibility at all, we have to
be prepared,'' he said.

Evans quits as Liverpool boss, leaving Houllier in charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Houllier quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Roy Evans stepped down as co-manager
of Liverpool on Thursday, leaving Frenchman Gerard Houllier in sole
charge of the struggling Premier League club.
	   Liverpool chairman David Moores said Evans, who has been with
the club for 33 years as a player, coach and manager, was leaving
by ``mutual consent.''
	   ``I felt over the past three or four weeks, things hadn't quite
been working out for the benefit of the club,'' Evans said at a
news conference. ``That was always uppermost in my mind. I dispute
my record is one of failure. At any other club it would be a
success but not at Liverpool.''
	   Evans declined an offer to accept another position with
Liverpool, saying he didn't want to be ``a ghost on the wall.''
	   ``If we're going to give Gerard and this team a chance, you have
to walk away,'' he said.
	   The move leaves Houllier, the former French national coach and
technical director, in charge for Saturday's home game against
Leeds.
	   Houllier becomes the first foreigner to have full control at
Anfield in the club's 106-year history. He is expected to bring in
fellow Frenchman Patrice Bergues, a Liverpool coach, as his
assistant.
	   Houllier is the second Frenchman in sole charge of a Premier
League club, joining Arsene Wenger, who guided Arsenal to the
League and Cup double last season.
	   ``Maybe at one stage they (players) didn't know tho was the
boss,'' Houllier admitted, ``Who they had to refer to.''
	   ``Let's face it, at the moment the results haven't been ideal,''
he added. ``We've had poor results for us. We've underachieved, the
fans are unhappy.''
	   Liverpool also announced that Evans' assistant, Doug Gilmore,
was leaving the club. He will be replaced by former Liverpool hero
Phil Thompson.
	   Thompson, who captained Liverpool to a European Cup victory in
1981, was fired from Liverpool's coaching staff by former boss
Graeme Souness in 1992. He has since worked as a commentator for
BSkyB television and Liverpool newspapers.
	   Evans departure became inevitable after Tuesday night's
humiliating 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham in a League Cup game. That
followed last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield to Derby, leaving
the Reds in 11th place in the bottom half of the Premier League
standings.
	   To make matters worse, 18-year-old striker Michael Owen could be
out for up to a month after suffering a hamstring injury against
Spurs, and midfielder Steve McManaman is sidelined for at least six
weeks with an Achilles problem.
	   ``I feel very sorry about Roy's departure,'' Houllier said. ``I
really liked working with him. My relationship with him was fine.
	   ``It was the joint management situation which was more of a
problem for the players, the staff and the media I would certainly
have preferred to take this job in different circumstances.''
	   Houllier will face a huge challenge in trying to recapture the
glory days at Liverpool, one of the world's most famous and
decorated clubs.
	   The Reds have won a record 18 English league championships, five
FA Cups, five League Cups, four European Cups and two UEFA Cups.
But Liverpool has been eclipsed in the 1990s as England's top club
by Manchester United, league champion in four of the last six
seasons.
	   ``It's a massive, massive club, the most successful club in
England, and we want to get it back to that state,'' Moores said.
	   Evans took over as Liverpool manager in January 1994 after the
resignation of Graeme Souness. The only trophy won by Liverpool
during Evans' reign was the lightly regarded League Cup in 1995.
	   Speculation over Evans' position grew when the club brought in
Houllier this summer to work alongside him in the unusual
arrangement of co-manager.
	   Since going to the top of the table on Sept. 9, the Reds have
won only three games _ against Fulham in the League Cup, Kosice in
the UEFA Cup and Nottingham Forest in the Premiership.
	   Evans admitted Wednesday that the pressure was taking its toll.
	   ``The speculation has been very difficult to live with,'' he
said. ``I have done this job with honesty and integrity and seeing
the club suffer does affect me badly.''
	   Evans' departure signals the end of the ``Bill Shankly era'' at
Anfield. Shankly created a dynasty that produced a string of
successful managers such as Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish
and Ronnie Moran.
	   Evans' departure marks the fourth management shakeup in the
Premier League this season after changes at Tottenham, Newcastle
and Leeds.
	   Dalglish was fired as Newcastle boss and replaced by Ruud
Gullit, George Graham left Leeds to take over for Christian Gross
at Spurs, and David O'Leary succeeded Graham at Leeds.

Report: First direct contact this government-ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: EDITS to clarify that previous Spanish government had contacts
with ETA; ADDS new final graf with background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and the armed Basque separatist group ETA have
made direct contact for the first time, an initial step toward new
peace talks, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The move followed Aznar's authorization last week of contacts
with ETA, the daily El Mundo reported, quoting unnamed government
sources.
	   Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office contacted by
The Associated Press, refused to comment on the report. He said
that although Aznar has promised to inform the public of all
developments related to the Basque peace process, the delicacy of
the issue requires that the details be treated with discretion.
	   El Mundo said the first direct contacts between this government
and ETA were limited to a recognition that there would be more
contact in the future.
	   The latest possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year-long
violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling the
Spanish-French border dates to Sept. 18 when ETA began observing an
indefinite cease-fire.
	   The government gradually softened its position on the truce,
with the initial suspicion developing into a promise of dialogue.
	   Although willing to talk, the government insists that the agenda
will not include political issues such as ETA's stated aim of
Basque independence.
	   The government says it is willing to talk about the fate of
ETA's 535 prisoners in return for a clear commitment to give up
violence forever and respect existing democratic procedures.
	   ETA--the initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Freedom--has killed nearly 800 people since taking up
arms in 1968.
	   The government last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when
Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist party was in office. The talks broke
down and the violence resumed.

Official: No intention of inviting pontiff to visit Vietnam
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Despite a request from Vietnamese bishops,
the communist country has no plans to invite Pope John Paul II to
visit next year, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said
Thursday.
	   The bishops had hoped the pontiff would be able to visit next
August for the 200th anniversary of the sighting of an apparition
of the Virgin Mary at the tiny village of La Vang. This year's
commemoration drew more than 100,000 people.
	   Although Buddhism is Vietnam's primary religion, about 8 million
of the 78 million people are Catholics. There have been recent
signs of improvement in the strained ties between the government
and the Vatican, but religion remains a touchy subject here.
	   Only religions approved by the government are permitted; others
are considered superstition that should be eliminated.
	   Human rights groups claim a number of dissidents are jailed for
their beliefs. The government says the only people in prison are

	   A recent visit by the U.N. special rapporteur on religious
intolerance, Abdelfattah Amor, ended with the official issuing a
statement lamenting restrictions that the government had placed on
him during his 10-day assessment trip.
	   The government responded by denying any limits had been placed
on Amor.

Italy, US reach accord increasing flights
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy and the United States on Thursday signed a
preliminary agreement meant to increase the number of flights
between the two countries and free prices from government
regulations.
	   The agreement would allow U.S. and Italian airlines to fly to
any airport in each other's country, a U.S. Embassy statement said.
Currently, airlines are allowed a limited number of flights and
cannot provide direct flights from all airports.
	   The accord would also open the market to new airlines on both
sides.
	   The two parties plan to finalize the accord once the U.S.
Department of Transportation approves a request by Italy's flag
carrier, Alitalia, to forge an alliance with an American carrier.
	   While Italy's request is being processed, the two sides agreed
to allow each other's airlines to provide one flight per day
between any points in their countries starting April 1, 1999.
	   The United States has signed so-called Open-Skies agreements
with 31 nations.

Argentina advances global warming talks with surprise announcement
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with U.S. to sign global warming treaty &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photo BAI102-103 &QL; 
 &UR; By KEVIN GRAY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ In a breakthough for
international efforts to reduce global warming, Argentina has
become the first developing country to seek to voluntarily cut back
on greenhouse gas emissions.
	   President Carlos Menem announced during a U.N. summit Wednesday
that Argentina would seek to join industrialized countries already
bound by a 1997 treaty to reduce carbon dioxide output by 2012.
	   ``Not only can highly advanced countries contribute to a new
world order, but also emerging nations,'' Menem told delegates from
over 160 nations.
	   In Washington, sources said that the United States planned to
sign the Kyoto global-warming accord Thursday in an effort to spur
developing nations to agree on reducing their own pollution.
	   Argentina's announcement gave a boost to U.S. efforts at the
summit to encourage developing countries to voluntarily commit to
reducing their emissions of greenhouse gases _ pollutants caused
primarily by motor vehicles and power plants.
	   And in another diplomatic victory, the chief U.S. climate change
negotiator announced late Wednesday the former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan was ready to make a similar commitment.
	   Kazakstan ``plans to announce tomorrow its intent to assume a
binding target to abate their emissions below business as usual by
the period 2008-2012,'' said Stuart Eizenstat.
	   Eizenstat, a U.S. undersecretary of state, did not offer
specifics on Kazakstan's plans to reduce its emissions. Messages
left with the Kazakstan delegation were not immediately returned.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
these emissions. Critics say global warming scenarios have not been
proven and that the costliness to achieve the cuts in the pact
threatens American industry.
	   Without specific plans to make the reductions, the moves by
Argentina and Kazakstan are largely symbolic. In addition, China
and India, which are expected to become the world's leading
greenhouse gas polluters by 2015, refused to discuss voluntary
emission targets for developing countries at the Buenos Aires
meeting.
	   But U.S. officials claimed the newest commitments were a
``breakthrough.''
	   White House adviser Todd Stern told The Associated Press that
Argentina's pledge opens ``a new pathway for developing countries''
to commit to emissions targets similar to those accepted by 38
industrialized nations in Kyoto, Japan, last year.
	   Ratification of the treaty has been slowed in the U.S. Congress,
where critics have called for more reductions from developing
countries.

Ratings agency says only three top Thai banks covered on loans
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Only Thailand's three biggest
commercial banks have made provisions approaching the real level of
their expected loan losses, an international rating agency said
Thursday.
	   Fitch IBCA said in a statement that after reviewing the
third-quarter results reported by Thai banks, it found that the
other banks have made provisions ``far short of what is required.''
	   The three biggest banks are Bangkok Bank PCL, Thai Farmers Bank
PCL and Krung Thai Bank PCL.
	   Fitch said that ``subject to a continued improvement in
Thailand's economy,'' only Bangkok Bank and Thai Farmers Bank
appear to be better placed to manage a turnaround in core operating
performance in 1999.
	   Thai commercial banks have not yet started any significant loan
restructuring and their high level of problem loans will continue
to depress their earnings over the next two years, Fitch said.
	   Three major banks _ Siam Commercial Bank PCL, Bank of Ayudhya
PCL and Thai Military Bank PCL _ are in ``precarious financial
condition,'' Fitch said.
	   ``Their current weak equity positions and poor earnings
performance are clearly inadequate to absorb anything but the most
optimistic of projections,'' the agency said.
	   Under tougher loan-loss provision rules adopted by the Bank of
Thailand on July 1, commercial banks will have to classify any
loans that do not pay interest or principal for three consecutive
months as problem loans, against previous rules of six months.
	   Banks will need to start to make additional provisions under
these new rules in the fourth quarter this year.
	   Fitch reaffirmed its earlier projection that the total cost of
bailing out Thai commercial banks and finance companies would
amount to 1.4 trillion baht (dlrs 38.3 billion), equivalent to 29
percent of the country's gross domestic product.

	   The statement was agreed to by Egypt, Syria, Saudi Arabia,
United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, Jordan and Qatar. They are a

officials have tried to rally Arab states to support the United

	   Saudi Arabia's assistance could be vital if President Bill

firepower in the Gulf area and on the way for the United States to
act unilaterally.
	   The statement gave no indication any of the Arab countries would
participate in a military operation, though,
	   Their help in the Gulf War of 1991, which liberated Kuwait from
Iraqi annexation, was largely symbolic, but significant in that it
made it harder for President Saddam Hussein to depict the conflict
as the United States against an Arab nation.

Official: Reforms to continue, but difficult to speed up
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL ALEXANDER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ Vietnam will not stray from its decade-old
path of economic reforms, but efforts to speed them up must be
tempered with reality, Deputy Prime Minister Nguyen Tan Dung said
Thursday.
	   Dung, who also is the central bank governor, said a recent visit
by World Bank and International Monetary Fund officials found that
the Doi Moi reforms are moving in the right direction, but ``they
want Vietnam to expedite and push up the pace of reform.''
	   ``We also would like to speed up,'' Dung told foreign media.
However, the reforms ``should be in conformity with the conditions
and strengths of Vietnam. We cannot indulge in wishful thinking.''
	   Foreign investors complain about Vietnam's red tape, overlapping
and conflicting laws, and weak banking system. The government has
responded that it is doing its best to overhaul its system, but
that such major changes take time.
	   Officials recently have been crediting their cautious approach
in dealing with the Asian economic crisis with partially insulating
the country from the fallout and avoiding instability. They also
have increasingly been looking at China as an example to follow.
	   Dung, in a wide-ranging two-hour news conference, reiterated
government commitments to shore up the agricultural sector with
increased capital investment while tackling inefficiency, lack of
competitiveness and bureaucracy within state-owned enterprises.
	   Officials also hope to spur the populace to invest some of their
savings in domestic companies.
	   ``We must exploit our internal strengths and channel them into
development,'' he said.
	   While he said the government wants to help the hard-hit
industrial sector, it will seek to avoid protectionism as it joins
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation group next week and seeks to
join the World Trade Organization and work out a bilateral trade
pact with the United States.
	   ``I can ensure you that those measures are in conformity ... and
are no hindrance to the integration process,'' he said.
	   Dung admitted that the state banking system is rife with
problems that include a high rate of overdue debt but said the
government is dealing with them. It closed two commercial banks in
September and is spending dlrs 200 million to recapitalize state
banks.
	   Despite the problems, Dung said the government forecasts that
year-end figures will show 6 percent growth in gross domestic
product for 1998. The target for next year is 5 to 6 percent.
	   It also hopes to keep inflation under 10 percent and the budget
deficit at no more than 3.5 percent.

Croat opposition boycotts parliament bodies
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ A coalition of the six biggest opposition
groups Thursday announced a boycott of all parliamentary
commissions to protest the ruling party's complete control of all
walks of life in Croatia.
	   The move by the six parties was also the strongest protest to
date against the rejection by the party of President Franjo
Tudjman's party of all reform efforts by the opposition in
parliament.
	   ``We cannot stand by and watch the role of parliament being
marginalized,'' said Radimir Cacic, theleader of one of the six
parties.
	   ``The ruling party is obstructing deputies from performing their
constitutional duties, and that is to supervise the government.''
he claimed.
	   Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union holds 74 of the 127
seats in parliament but is supported by between 12 and 16 deputies
from other smaller parties, enough to effectively control
legislative work in the chamber.
	   In recent months, the ruling party has blocked all attempts by
the opposition to enact reforms in the economic, health and defense
sectors.
	   The opposition coalition said that the recent rejection of an
impartial inquiry into the abuse of the intelligence service for
political goals, including supervision of the media, tipped the
scales in favor of a joint boycott.
	   ``The opposition has for long been a national ornament,
betraying a false picture of democracy,'' said Drazen Budisa,
leader of the Social Liberals, who gave up his post as deputy
president of parliament and other posts.
	   Croatia has been rocked by a series of scandals involving top
government officials. However, they have been swept under the
carpet by the ruling party or gone unsanctioned by an ineffective
legal system.
	   It was not clear how long the boycott would last, but the
opposition leaders suggested that early elections were the best way
out of the crisis. General elections are scheduled in late 1999.

Yugoslavia names team for Ireland; mobile phones banned
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS pointing out player availability dispute &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Yugoslavia, caught up in a dispute
over player availability, on Thursday named its 20-man squad for
Wednesday's European Championship qualifying match with Ireland at
Belgrade's Red Star stadium.
	   Scheduled for Oct. 10, the match was postponed because of the
crisis in Kosovo province and the threat of NATO air strikes.
	   The Group 8 qualifier has been difficult to stage with both
sides caught up in disputes with club teams over player
availability.
	   FIFA, the governing body of world soccer, ruled this week that
club teams could use Ireland and Yugoslav players in weekend
matches.
	   The main question mark was the inclusion of third-team
goalkeeper Sasa Ilic with his English Premier League team Charlton
refusing to release him until after Saturday's league match.
	   Major changes include the dropping of injured Kristijan
Djordjevic and Perica Ognjenovic, and the return of Vladimir
Jugovic. Also included is 26-year-old Djordje Tomic, making his
debut.
	   Coach Milan Zivadinovic is also reported to have banned his
players from using mobile phones, a move to boost their
concentration.
	   ``I want my players to be able to concentrate 100 percent,'' he
was quoted as saying.
	   About 1,000 visas issued to the Irish team and fans have
expired. But the Yugoslav Soccer Association said it hoped the
authorities would show leniency and prolong the visas.
	   The team:
	   Ivica Kralj (Porto), Nikola Damjanac (Partizan), Sasa Ilic
(Charlton), Goran Djorovic (Celta), Sinisa Mihajlovic (Lazio),
Mitroslav Djukic (Valencia), Nisa Saveljic (Bordeaux), Slobodan
Komljenovic (Duisburg), Slavisa Jokanovic (Tenerife), Dragan
Stojkovic (Nagoya), Vladimir Jugovic (Atletico Madrid), Dejan
Stankovic (Lazio), Jovan Stankovic (Mallorca), Ljubinko Drulovic
(Porto), Nenad Grozdic (Obilic), Djordje Tomic (Partizan), Predrag
Mijatovic (Real Madrid), Savo Milosevic (Real Zaragosa), Darko
Kovacevic (Real Sociedad), Sasa Kovacevic (Obilic).

Evans quits as Liverpool boss, leaving Houllier in charge
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Moores quote on Thompson; minor editing

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ Roy Evans stepped down as co-manager
of Liverpool on Thursday, leaving Frenchman Gerard Houllier in sole
charge of the struggling Premier League club.
	   Liverpool chairman David Moores said Evans, who has been with
the club for 33 years as a player, coach and manager, was leaving
by ``mutual consent.''
	   ``I felt over the past three or four weeks, things hadn't quite
been working out for the benefit of the club,'' Evans said at a
news conference. ``That was always uppermost in my mind. I dispute
my record is one of failure. At any other club it would be a
success but not at Liverpool.''
	   Evans declined an offer to accept another position with
Liverpool, saying he didn't want to be ``a ghost on the wall.''
	   ``If we're going to give Gerard and this team a chance, you have
to walk away,'' he said.
	   The move leaves Houllier, the former French national coach and
technical director, in charge for Saturday's home game against
Leeds.
	   ``Maybe at one stage they (players) didn't know who was the boss
_ who they had to refer to,'' Houllier said of his ill-fated
partnership with Evans.
	   ``Let's face it, at the moment the results haven't been ideal,''
he added. ``We've had poor results for us. We've underachieved, the
fans are unhappy.''
	   Houllier becomes the first foreigner to have full control at
Anfield in the club's 106-year history.
	   He is the second Frenchman in sole charge of a Premier League
club, joining Arsene Wenger, who guided Arsenal to the League and
Cup double last season.
	   Liverpool also announced that Evans' assistant, Doug Gilmore,
was leaving the club. He will be replaced by former Liverpool hero
Phil Thompson.
	   Thompson, who captained Liverpool to a European Cup victory in
1981, was fired from Liverpool's coaching staff by former boss
Graeme Souness in 1992. He has since worked as a commentator for
BSkyB television and Liverpool newspapers.
	   Moores said Thompson provided the necessary ``passion'' for the
job.
	   ``We don't want to go completely foreign,'' he said.
	   Evans departure became inevitable after Tuesday night's
humiliating 3-1 home defeat to Tottenham in a League Cup game. That
followed last Saturday's 2-1 defeat at Anfield to Derby, leaving
the Reds in 11th place in the bottom half of the Premier League
standings.
	   To make matters worse, 18-year-old striker Michael Owen could be
out for up to a month after suffering a hamstring injury against
Spurs, and midfielder Steve McManaman is sidelined for at least six
weeks with an Achilles problem.
	   ``I feel very sorry about Roy's departure,'' Houllier said. ``I
really liked working with him. My relationship with him was fine.
	   ``It was the joint management situation which was more of a
problem for the players, the staff and the media I would certainly
have preferred to take this job in different circumstances.''
	   Houllier will face a huge challenge in trying to recapture the
glory days at Liverpool, one of the world's most famous and
decorated clubs.
	   The Reds have won a record 18 English league championships, five
FA Cups, five League Cups, four European Cups and two UEFA Cups.
But Liverpool has been eclipsed in the 1990s as England's top club
by Manchester United, league champion in four of the last six
seasons.
	   ``It's a massive, massive club, the most successful club in
England, and we want to get it back to that state,'' Moores said.
	   Evans took over as Liverpool manager in January 1994 after the
resignation of Souness. The only trophy won by Liverpool during
Evans' reign was the lightly regarded League Cup in 1995.
	   Speculation over Evans' position grew when the club brought in
Houllier this summer to work alongside him in the unusual
arrangement of co-manager.
	   Since going to the top of the table on Sept. 9, the Reds have
won only three games _ against Fulham in the League Cup, Kosice in
the UEFA Cup and Nottingham Forest in the Premiership.
	   Evans admitted Wednesday that the pressure was taking its toll.
	   ``The speculation has been very difficult to live with,'' he
said. ``I have done this job with honesty and integrity and seeing
the club suffer does affect me badly.''
	   Evans' departure signals the end of the ``Bill Shankly era'' at
Anfield. Shankly created a dynasty that produced a string of
successful managers such as Bob Paisley, Joe Fagan, Kenny Dalglish
and Ronnie Moran.
	   Evans' departure marks the fourth management shakeup in the
Premier League this season after changes at Tottenham, Newcastle
and Leeds.
	   Dalglish was fired as Newcastle boss and replaced by Ruud
Gullit, George Graham left Leeds to take over for Christian Gross
at Spurs, and David O'Leary succeeded Graham at Leeds.

	   EILAT, Israel (AP) - Hundreds of British tourists began leaving
Israel's Red Sea resort of Eilat Thursday as the Gulf crisis
deepened and the Israeli army opened gas mask distribution centers
for civilians.
	   The British tour operator Thomson, which had 600 customers in
Eilat, sent four flights, with room for 150 passengers each to
bring the tourists home.
	   The British Foreign Office advised British nationals to leave
Israel as the United States stepped up its preparations for the
possibility of a military strike against Iraq. ``We advise against
all non-essential travel to Israel and the Occupied Territories,''
the Foreign Office statement said.
	   The United States and Canada have issued similar travel
advisories for their citizens traveling in the area.
	   ``We just heard this morning that we should leave,'' said John
Butler, from London, as he and his wife Laura got on the bus for
the drive to the airport. ``We're very sorry. We really enjoyed it
here.''

Dancer bumps, grinds protest of alleged rape attempt by diplomat

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Gyrating in front of Israel's Foreign Ministry,
an Israeli belly dancer bedecked with bangles and beads on Thursday
protested an alleged sexual assault by an Egyptian diplomat.
	   An Israeli court threw out a criminal case against Egyptian
Ambassador Mohammad Bassiouny, after Shlomit Shalom, 32, charged
that Bassiouny tried to rape her last year, after offering her a
birthday present.
	   A civil court dismissed her dlrs 286,000 damage claim, ruling
that Bassiouny has diplomatic immunity against such charges.
	   Strutting her best stuff for Israel's sometimes stuffy
diplomats, Shalom charged that Israel's government is taking
Bassiouny's side, giving him legal assistance. She demanded that
they ask him to leave his post.
	   Bassiouny, Egypt's ambassador to Israel for 18 years, is the
longest-serving top-ranking foreign diplomat in Israel. He denies
any wrongdoing.
	   Accenting her case with a gold crown, a black, sequined dress
and heavy blue eye makeup, she drew attention to signs held by more
conventionally clad women. One read, ``There is no diplomatic
immunity for rape.''
	   Her lawyer, Nitsana Darshan-Leitner, wearing a quiet business
suit, claimed Israel does not even have a diplomatic immunity law
on its books.
	   Foreign Ministry officials acknowledged that, but said the
diplomatic immunity concept is rooted in international law and has
been upheld by Israeli courts.
	   Darshan-Leitner was having none of that. She declared, ``Israel
should not sacrifice the rights of women for a diplomatic
relationship with a foreign country.'' She said Israel does not
have to break off relations with Egypt _ just ask it to send
another ambassador.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ A U.S. Air Force serviceman has been convicted by a
court martial and sentenced to a month in jail for cheating in a
test to obtain promotion, a military spokesman said Wednesday.
	   Air Force Tech. Sgt. Kevin Mitchell, 38, of New Haven,
Connecticut, was convicted Tuesday of obtaining the answers before
taking the Air Force enlisted promotion test, held in 1997, said
1st Lt. Aaron Burgstein.
	   Mitchell, stationed at Yokota Air Base outside of Tokyo, was
also demoted and sentenced to 45 days of hard labor, Burgstein
said. He had pleaded guilty.
	   Six other Air Force personnel stationed at Yokota also faced
court martials on charges of cheating. Their names and hometowns
were not immediately available.

New German government: Budget gap higher than expected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany's finance minister said Thursday
that next year's government budget gap will be 10 billion marks
(dlrs 6 billion) higher than had been calculated by the previous
government.
	   Oskar Lafontaine's announcement was a damper for spending plans
by the center-left government elected in September, which has
promised to beef up social programs, cut taxes and maintain fiscal
discipline all at the same time.
	   Lafontaine predicted an economic slowdown in 1999, citing lower
domestic demand and Asia's financial crisis. He said he expects the
budget gap to be 20 billion marks (dlrs 12 billion) above earlier
calculations by 2002.
	   Lafontaine's predecessor, Theo Waigel, had foreseen a 56 billion
mark (dlrs 33 billion) shortfall for 1999.
	   German finance officials have already raised alarm among
business and many economists by indicating that the new government
may step up deficit spending.
	   But Lafontaine said the ``burdensome financial legacy'' of
former Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government will force the new
administration into a strict course of fiscal consolidation.
	   His comments followed a twice-yearly forecast of tax revenues by
an expert panel.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb civilians detained dozens of
Albanians on Thursday, threatening to kill some of them unless two
Serbs apparently abducted by separatist guerrillas were released, a
Kosovo Albanian organization said.
	   Civilians with submachine guns stopped vehicles carrying ethnic
Albanians, demanding the release of two fellow Serbs who
disappeared Wednesday, the Kosovo Information Center said. The
center reflects the views of the main ethnic Albanian political
party in the Serbian province.
	   Up to 100 had been detained by early Thursday on a main road
near the border to Montenegro, which makes up Yugoslavia along with
Serbia.
	   Dozens of the detained Albanians were taken away to the village
of Crnac, 30 miles (50 kilometers) northwest of Pristina. Some of
them phoned Pristina to relay their abductors' demands for the
release of the two Serbs.
	   ``If we failed to do this, they said they would kill us,'' Ismet
Haziri, one of those taken by the Serbs, was quoted by the center
as saying
	   Serb sources confirmed the abduction but said those taken were
being released.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat heading of an effort to
carry out a peace deal in Kosovo promised to ``take appropriate
steps'' after finding out exact circumstances of the abductions.
	   The detentions reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian
tensions in Kosovo even after an Oct. 12 agreement to end the
crisis.
	   The crackdown on ethnic Albanians seeking independence has left
hundreds dead and made refugees of hundreds of thousands more.
	   In the past week, at least two Serb policemen have been killed
and three injured, while six guerrillas of the Kosovo Liberation
Army have died from police gunfire.
	   At a Thursday memorial in the western village of Retimlje for
five comrades killed Nov. 6 when their cars ran into a police
patrol, KLA fighters vowed revenge.
	   ``Their deaths unite us even more, and their blood gives us more
strength,'' said Sebajdin Cena, a KLA commader.

Hyundai resists pressure to recall cars claimed to be faulty
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ South Korean car manufacturer Hyundai
said Thursday it would resist pressure to recall 46,000 vehicles
sold in Australia that consumer and motoring groups claim are
potentially unsafe.
	   Hyundai chief executive C.K. Liew said the company was adopting
responsible engineering, legal and moral procedures toward an
investigation of potential welding failures affecting the front
suspension and steering of some Excel models.
	   ``We will not be railroaded into making premature decisions that
are not in the best interests of customers,'' Liew said.
	   Hyundai executives met Thursday with officers of the
government's Federal Office of Road Safety about the investigation.
	   Transport Minister John Anderson said Hyundai had until next
week to prove it had adequately dealt with safety problems in the
cars in question.
	   It was revealed this week that Excels made in South Korea
between August 1994 and March 1996 could have defects in underbody
welds.
	   The Australian Automobile Association said it found cracking in
welds that secured the right front wheel and suspension, meaning
that in extreme cases the wheel and drive shaft could become
detached and jam in the wheel housing.
	   Hyundai has refused the association's calls for a recall of the
cars, saying the problem does not pose a safety threat.
	   Meanwhile, The Australian newspaper reported Thursday that
Hyundai two years ago recalled the same model of car in Puerto Rico
after problems similar to those found in Australia were reported.
	   The U.S. National Highway Transportation Safety Authority issued
a safety notice in August 1996 for the Hyundai Accent, as the model
was called, the paper reported. The authority did not order a
recall in the United States.
	   Hyundai had linked the problem to a local drivers' custom of
mounting gutters when parking, putting unusual strain on the cars,
the newspaper reported.

	   The foreign ministers from Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states
called on Iraq to respect U.N. resolutions and fully cooperate with
the weapons inspectors.
	   The statement expressed hope that ``wisdom and restraint prevail
so that the U.N. can reach a solution to the crisis.''
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Arab
statement ``reflects the growing and near unanimity, especially in

Report: Israel says suspects in Cyprus were Mossad agents
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Netanyahu clarifying statement about bringing
agents home &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Two Israelis who were arrested in Cyprus last
week on suspicion of spying are agents of the Israeli intelligence
agency Mossad, an Israeli newspaper said Thursday.
	   Officials in Cyprus reportedly have said that Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's assertion earlier this week that ``of
course we'll bring them home'' had damaged chances the two would be
quickly released.
	   Asked to explain his remark, Netanyahu said Thursday: ``I don't
intend to go in there and extract them, if that's what you mean.
Obviously we care for all Israeli citizens. We look after our
citizens just as any other country looks after its citizens.''
	   Israel has not acknowledged that the two are Israeli agents.
Earlier this week, the Israeli Foreign Ministry would only say that
rumors that the two were spying on behalf of Turkey, Israel's
military ally, were not true. Turkey has occupied the northern
third of Cyprus since an invasion in 1974.
	   The statement also said the two men were not acting against
Cyprus.
	   Cypriot police arrested the Israelis in the coastal fishing town
of Ziyi on Saturday and accused them of spying on a nearby army
base.
	   The Haaretz daily said Thursday that the two men were part of an
Israeli intelligence operation held near Ziyi last Friday and
Saturday. The newspaper said it learned from a senior source in
Cyprus that the two men had been guarding a meeting of Mossad
agents. They were listening to police scanners to make sure no one
approached the meeting place, the newspaper said.
	   The Mossad told the authorities in Cyprus that it was not
interested in damaging Nicosia's sovereignty and that it was simply
going about its business.
	   Israeli President Ezer Weizman, who visited Cyprus for three
days last week, sent an envoy to the island on Sunday in efforts to
ease tensions over the case.

Ribbeck recalls five, names striker Zickler
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German coach Erich Ribbeck on Thursday
recalled veterans Lothar Matthaeus and Andreas Moeller and named a
rookie striker, Alexander Zickler of Bayern Munich, for next week's
exhibition game against the Netherlands.
	   Matthaeus, 37, missed Germany's opening two qualifying games for
the 2000 European Championship last month against Turkey and
Moldova because of an injury.
	   Ribbeck, who took over after Berti Vogts' resignation in
September, had promised to recall the veteran Bayern Munich
sweeper, who has a record 129 appearances for Germany.
	   Moeller, 31, retired from the national team after the World Cup
but made himself available when Ribbeck became the new coach. He
did not travel to Turkey and Moldova, however.
	   Germany got off to a rocky start in its defense of the European
title, losing 1-0 to Turkey but beating Moldova 3-1.
	   Although Wednesday's match against the Netherlands in
Gelsenkirchen is an exhibition, games between the neighboring
rivals can often become hostile, emotionally charged showdowns and
clashes between violent fans from both sides are frequent.
	   More than 1,000 police officers will be responsible for
security, including specially trained Dutch troopers.
	   ``We assume that violence-prone fans will come to
Gelsenkirchen,'' said Ulrich Grzella, the local police chief in
charge of security for the match. ``But we hope that there will be

	   The foreign ministers from Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states
called on Iraq to respect U.N. resolutions and fully cooperate with
the weapons inspectors.
	   The statement expressed hope that ``wisdom and restraint prevail
so that the U.N. can reach a solution to the crisis.''
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the Arab
statement ``reflects the growing and near unanimity, especially in

consequences.''
	   During the two-day conference, the Arab foreign ministers also
discussed the Middle East peace accord and the Syrian-Turkish

	   The two-day conference is the first meeting of the so-called
Damascus-8 since July 1997. The group normally meets twice a year,
but it canceled a meeting last December after a row between Egypt
and Qatar.
	   By the Damascus Declaration of 1991, Egypt and Syria pledged to
defend the security of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and Gulf states promised to give
aid to the Cairo and Damascus governments.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army opened gas mask distribution
centers Thursday in preparation for a possible attack by Iraq,
though a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
the probability of Israel being targeted was ``close to zero.''
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, urged the United States to exhaust
the diplomatic option. ``I hope and urge that there will not be an
attack against Iraq,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The
Jerusalem Post. ``Peace in the Middle East will be negatively
affected by a U.S. attack.''
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with top ministers
Thursday to discuss Israeli preparedness for a possible U.S. strike
that might trigger an Iraqi attack on Israel.
	   At a news conference Thursday Netanyahu said ``a real crisis is
developing,'' between the U.S. and Iraq. Asked if he had a gas
mask, Netanyahu said ``I think so. I haven't checked. It's one of
the problems when you have to get one of these things out of the
closet.''

Media urged to ease suicide coverage after copycat cases
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ Mental health authorities have urged
television stations to curb coverage of suicides after the
much-aired death of a woman who fell from a six-story building led
to a spate of apparent copycat suicide attempts.
	   Meanwhile, the would-be rescuer of the woman, who apparently
caused her to fall, has been threatened with a wrongful death
lawsuit from her family, the newspaper The Nation reported
Thursday. He is being held in protective police custody to keep him
from killing himself.
	   Sommart Phromphrapha has been repeatedly seen by millions of
Thai television viewers making a lunge to grab Sripraphai
Cheoyphiew, 25, who spent five hours Monday balanced on the ledge
of her apartment building in Hat Yai, southern Thailand,
threatening to jump.
	   Sripraphai appeared well-balanced on the ledge, but was startled
and fell backward when Sommart tried to grab her. He managed to
clutch her trousers as she dangled over the sidewalk, but they tore
away and she fell to her death.
	   Four similar suicide attempts, one successful, were reported
Tuesday in the wake of her death. Mental health authorities blamed
at least one case on copycat inspiration.
	   Despite the Mental Health Department's appeal for television
stations to curb their coverage, however, at least one station
Thursday was still airing the successful resolution of a threat by
a woman to jump from a building.
	   Two new suicides were reported Thursday, though there was no
immediate attempt to link them to the Hat Yai case.
	   One involved a woman who drowned herself and her dog by jumping
into a canal in Bangkok. The other was a homeless man who hanged
himself at a Buddhist temple in the northeastern city of Khon Kaen.

French president in Mexico; trade high on agenda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With talks on Mexican-European free trade
beginning, French President Jacques Chirac on Thursday began an
official visit to Mexico that officials said would improve economic
ties between the two countries.
	   Chirac, his wife Bernadette and a delegation of 50 officials and
businessmen arrived around midnight on the first step of a trip
that will also take him to the hurricane-devastated countries of
Central America.
	   President Ernesto Zedillo officially welcomed Chirac in a
ceremony Thursday morning at the Campo Marte, with school children
waving French flags.
	   Chirac was to address Mexico's Congress later in the day.
	   ``It is a very special moment in relation between Mexico and
France,'' Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green said this week,
noting that France has promoted a European Union free trade
agreement with Mexico.
	   Technical negotiations on that treaty began this week in Mexico
City and were expected to continue intermittently until at least
mid-1999 here and in Brussels.
	   Chirac was to sign agreements on trade, education, the
environment and energy was to inaugurate a French educational
exposition.
	   The proposed trade agreement would be a first for the European
Union in the Americas and might offer European countries a stronger
position in the United States and Canada, Mexico's partners in the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
	   Mexico itself is the world's 15th-largest economy, with about
100 million consumers.
	   For Mexico, relations with Europe help it balance the heavy
influence of its big northern neighbor. The United States accounts
for 85 percent of Mexican exports.
	   The 15-nation European Union as a bloc is Mexico's
second-largest trading partner, but two-way commerce accounted for
only 6.4 percent of Mexican trade during the first six months of
the year, down from 14.5 percent 10 years ago.
	   Mexico's trade with France totaled almost dlrs 1.5 billion last
year, with Mexican imports far outpacing exports. Trade in the
first half of 1998 showed an increased pace, reaching dlrs 928
million.
	   Among European countries, France ranks fourth in trade with
Mexico and fifth in investment here.

Arafat urges U.S. restraint, says attack would hurt Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat urged the United States
to exercise restraint Thursday and avoid striking at Iraq, a move
the Palestinian leader said would be detrimental to Mideast peace.
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   ``I hope and urge that there will not be an attack against
Iraq,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The Jerusalem Post.
``Peace in the Middle East will be negatively affected by a U.S.
attack.''
	   Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian negotiator said that an
attack on a fellow Arab nation by the current sponsor of the
Mideast peace process would wipe away any sense of hope among
Palestinian people for peace.
	   During the Gulf War, there was wide-spread popular Palestinian
support for the Iraqi attacks on Israel and mild street support
during subsequent crises.
	   ``If the street goes out and denounces America for the strike,
the Palestinian Authority would be in a difficult position when
working with the U.S. on the peace process.''
	   ``The Palestinian Authority would have to say it is against the
American action and it will all be an awkward position,'' Asfour
said.
	   In a meeting with Israeli journalists Wednesday, Arafat said he
was optimistic however that the current crisis over United Nations
weapons inspections could still be resolved through diplomacy.

Carlos eases hunger strike strike, wishes luck to bin Laden
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ramirez beginning to drink water; newspaper
interview conducted in writing; corrects spelling of Ilich &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The man known as Carlos the Jackal, who began a
hunger strike nine days ago, has begun drinking water to avoid
being carted off to a hospital, his lawyer said Thursday.
	   The Venezuelan-born Ilich Ramirez Sanchez maintained in an
interview published Thursday that he is certain he will spend the
rest of his days in prison. Still, he said he has ``no regrets,''
and he wished good luck to Osama bin Laden.
	   ``Our paths have been different but we have the same enemy and I
wish him (bin Laden) the greatest success possible in his fight,''
Ramirez was quoted as saying by the newspaper France-Soir. The
interview was conducted via written questions submitted in advance,
according to Ramirez's lawyers.
	   Bin Laden, a Saudi millionaire, has been indicted by a U.S.
federal court in the Aug. 7 bombings of two U.S. embassies in East
Africa that killed 224 people.
	   Ramirez, 49, who is serving a life term at La Sante prison,
began drinking water late Tuesday, exactly a week after first
refusing all food and liquids to protest prison conditions,
according to attorney Francois Honnorat.
	   ``He thought that, given the stage he was at, he would lose
consciousness .... And he refuses to be fed intravenously,''
Honnorat said in a telephone interview.
	   Prison policy in such cases is to transfer the prisoner to a
hospital and feed him intravenously should he lose consciousness.
	   Ramirez has been in solitary confinement since French agents
snared him in Khartoum, Sudan, on Aug. 15, 1994, then hauled him to
Paris in a sack. He was convicted last December of the murders of
two French investigators and a Lebanese national. He is under
investigation for four terrorist attacks in France.
	   Despite his hunger strike, Ramirez has remained prolific,
writing to lawyers, the press and even to Iran's supreme religious
leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
	   Commenting on the situation in the Middle East, Ramirez told
France Soir he considers Saddam Hussein to be the last of the
Arabian knights.
	   ``I would be happy to fight under his orders, as a mere foot
soldier against the United States and Israel,'' Ramirez was quoted
as saying.
	   As for Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, Ramirez said he opposes
his policies, even though they are ``logical.''
	   ``My greatest pride is to have contributed to placing the
Palestinian cause on the highest level,'' Ramirez said.
	   Ramirez's lawyers told The Associated Press last week that they
had co-signed his will, and that he is preparing mentally for
death.
	   A prison medical exam found that he had lost more than 17 pounds
after six days without food and water, the lawyers said, leaving
the portly man weighing 181 pounds on Monday.

Pinochet supporters serve Internet death threat against Spanish
</HEADLINE>
judge &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Supporters of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet on Monday issued a death threat through the
Internet against the Spanish judge who ordered the former despot's
arrest recently in London.
	   ``We are prepared to do anything.....even a kidnapping, a bomb
attack or assassination of (Judge) Baltasar Garzon, his wife
Rosario and/or his relatives,'' said the statement which was signed
by a hitherto unknown group calling itself the ``Organized Extreme
Right.''
	   ``We don't rule out an attack resulting in death which would be
carried out if Judge Garzon obtains (Pinochet's) extradition,''
said the statement which was run on the World Wide Web address
`angelfire.com/de/lokofox.'
	   Garzon had 82-year-old Pinochet arrested Oct. 16 in London where
the former dictator was recovering from back surgery.
	   The Spanish government on Tuesday transferred to Britain the
judge's request to extradite Pinochet to face charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture relating to the killing and disappearance of
thousands of people during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   The case is pending a decision by British judges on whether to
uphold or reject an English High Court ruling that Pinochet's
arrest was illegal and that as a former head of state he was
entitled to diplomatic immunity.
	   In the Internet page, Pinochet supporters said they would be
forced to act if the Chilean government of President Eduardo Frei
fails to defend the former dictator they refer to as the ``founder
of modern Chile'' and the ``Undefeated Ex-General of the Chilean
Army.''
	   The statement warns that it will continue to ``pressure, to
harass and attack one way or another English and Spanish residents
in our country.''

Anwar accuses Malaysia's prime minister of big spending
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Anwar Trial &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Anwar Ibrahim on Thursday accused
his former boss, Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, of being a big
spender for buying a dlrs 50 million executive jet.
	   It was the latest verbal jousting between the two men, who once
claimed to have a nearly father-son relationship.
	   Mahathir was quick on the defense. Just hours later, the
Malaysian prime minister emphasized that the aircraft belongs to
the government and not to him.
	   ``I don't have that much money,'' he told reporters.
	   Earlier, in a statement read by his wife, Azizah Ismail, Anwar
had said the multimillion-dollar plane would boast an
``impressive'' interior decor designed by Mahathir himself.
	   That is rare praise, if it can be considered that, from Anwar.
He became the prime minister's fiercest critic after he was fired
from the twin posts of deputy prime minister and finance minister
on Sept. 2.
	   Mahathir says Anwar, who is charged with sodomy and abuse of
power, is morally unfit to rule Malaysia. Anwar's current trial
stems in part from a power clash between the two men.
	   Anwar, who is being held in prison during the trial, also
accused Mahathir of approving plans for an ``ostentatious'' new
official residence that would cost the Malaysian government more
than dlrs 50 million.
	   ``The people can see for themselves how the prime minister lives
in his glittering palace and flies in his sophisticated executive
jet,'' Anwar said in the statement read by his wife.

Russian defense minister to visit Mideast for talks on Iraq
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's defense minister will leave for the
Middle East on Friday, as Moscow appeared to be seeking allies
among Iraq's neighbors to oppose the growing possibility of
military strikes.
	   Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev planned to consult with Syria's
military leaders and Egypt's officials about the Iraqi crisis
during his tour, which will last through Tuesday, the Interfax news
agency reported.
	   Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Posuvalyuk also conferred
with Iran's ambassador to Moscow Mehdi Safari, and the two
criticized the increasing threat of U.S.-led airstrikes against
Iraq, the Russian Foreign Ministry said Thursday.
	   Despite assurances by U.S. officials that they have the backing
of countries in the Persian Gulf, the region's officials have
clearly indicated that they oppose a military strike.
	   Posuvalyuk and Safari called for ``continuing efforts aimed at
settling the escalating the Iraq problem through political means in
the framework of the United Nations,'' the Foreign Ministry
statement read, according to Interfax.
	   The Russian government has called for the early lifting of
international sanctions against Iraq, but has not moved to act
unilaterally. The sanctions were imposed following Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait, and the United Nations says they will not be
lifted until inspectors verify that Iraq has destroyed its weapons
of mass destruction.
	   Iraq owes Moscow billions of dollars from Soviet times, when the
Arab nation was a big arms buyer.
	   Meanwhile, Russian Communist leader Gennady Zyuganov resumed
vehement protests against possible U.S. military strikes.
	   ``The Americans' hands are itching; they make one threat after
another,'' Zyuganov said.
	   ``The policy of war in the Middle East is not only hopeless, but
is extremely dangerous for the whole planet.''
	   During Sergeyev's tour of the Middle East, the defense minister
also planned to discuss selling Russian weapons to Syria and Egypt,
Interfax reported.
	   ``The armies of these Middle Eastern nations are largely
equipped with Soviet and Russian weapons and military technology,''
Sergeyev said.
	   ``The Russian side understands that the United States has a
strong influence in Egypt due to provisions of help to that
country, including military supplies. But in Cairo they haven't
forgotten the aid provided by Moscow in the past.''

	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) - A 90-year-old suspected Nazi war
criminal will be brought to trial in January on charges of sending
scores of Jews to their deaths when he was a top police officer
during World War, a Lithuanian court ruled Thursday.
	   Kazys Gimzauskas, a former U.S. citizen, was deputy chief of the
Vilnius security police during the 1940-41 Nazi occupation of this
small Baltic nation. He has been charged with genocide for
participating in the near extermination of Lithuania's Jewish
community, and has denied any wrongdoing.
	   The Vilnius District Court on Thursday set a trial date of Jan.
5 for Gimzauskas, who was stripped of his U.S. citizenship for
hiding his Nazi past and fled to Lithuanian from St. Petersburg,
Florida in 1993.
	   Gimzauskas is the second Lithuania involved in a major Nazi war
crimes trial since Lithuanian gained independence from the Soviet
Union in 1991.
	   His superior in the Nazi-run security police, Aleksandras
Lileikis, 91, was brought to trial on similar charges this month,
but was rushed away in an ambulance just as the case was opening.
	   Both men claim to be too ill to face trial. A law recently
passed in Lithuania allows war crimes suspects to be indicted, but
not tried, in absentia.
	   In the Gimzauskas case, prosecutors are expected to focus on
five Lithuanian Jews they believe they can prove Gimzauskas turned
over for execution. More than 90 percent of Lithuania's prewar
Jewish community of 240,000 died during the war.
	   Some Jewish groups accuse Lithuania of delaying trials of Nazi
war criminals to avoid confronting the nation's past under German
occupation.

South Africa announces cuts in army
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The army will cut about 14,000
soldiers and officers from its ranks over the next three years in a
major restructuring, officials said Thursday.
	   The government is seeking to reduce the force by a total of
20,000, bringing it to 70,000, as a money-saving measure.
	   About half the personnel in the latest round of reductions will
take severance packages or go because of natural attrition such as
retirements or normal resignations, Col. Johan Preller, a senior
staff officer, told reporters.
	   One of the crucial aspects of South Africa's transition from an
apartheid state to democracy has been reforming the armed forces,
including integrating former anti-apartheid guerrillas with the
soldiers who once fought them.
	   ``The staffing process is not about chasing white officers
away,'' said Maj. Gen. Themba Matanzima, director of force support.
``We are looking for the best candidates to take the army into the
new scenario.''
	   The measures would include reducing personnel at army
headquarters in Pretoria from 1,800 to 214, deputy army chief Maj.
Gen. Roland de Vries said.
	   Nine regional commands would be reduced to five, and the number
of infantry units would drop from 21 to eight, officials said.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Greeted by chanting supporters and
smiling young women perched along balconies, Anwar Ibrahim may well
be Malaysia's first celebrity defendant.
	   Waving to the crowds, the 51-year-old Anwar causes a huge ruckus
every time he leaves the colonnaded, brick courthouse in downtown
Kuala Lumpur.
	   He has been on trial for two weeks for alleged sexual misconduct
and abuse of power. He denies the charges and says he is the victim
of a vendetta launched by his former patron, Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad.
	   ``Long live Anwar,'' scream 200 supporters waiting for a glimpse
of their hero. ``Reforms, reforms! Mahathir, resign!''
	   In fact, Prime Minister Mahathir's rivalry with his former
deputy Anwar is at the heart of the case.
	   Yet, while many such power struggles would be settled
politically, Anwar's wound up in court in this conservative Muslim
nation.
	   Late Thursday, smiling young women in pastel-colored scarves
skipped an hour of work at their courthouse jobs, lining up along
balconies to see the popular and handsome defendant leaving for the
day.
	   Crowds of news photographers and TV crews stood outside the
courthouse gates, waiting with hair-trigger reflexes to get that
all-important shot of Anwar. Two photographers hovered overhead in
a specially rented cherry-picker crane.
	   Anwar's not one to disappoint.
	   As court personnel tried to block the view, Anwar climbed up on
the floorboard of a waiting sports utility vehicle, and waved long
and leisurely to make sure everyone got a shot of him smiling.
	   ``OK,'' said one photographer with a sigh of relief, giving the
thumbs-up sign.
	   Two hundred meters (220 yards) away, the crowd of supporters
standing in front of a mosque went wild with shouts and cheers as a
police convoy raced him back to prison.
	   Officially, Anwar faces a prison term of 14 years or more, and
political oblivion. Practically, he looks and acts more like a
movie star leaving the Academy Awards ceremony.
	   He still draws on the same charm he used in his twin roles of
finance minister and deputy prime minister before his downfall on
Sept. 2. He was arrested 2 1/2 weeks later after leading an
anti-government rally of 30,000 people in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
	   ``My uncle is not guilty,'' said Rezal Huzairi Zaki, the
23-year-old son of Anwar's sister.
	   The defendant's slender nephew, wearing a white and purple
ribbon as a sign of solidarity, recalled how Anwar would visit him
in his kampong, or Malaysian village.
	   ``He would always take us along with him,'' Rezal said. ``He
cared about us. He asked us about our studies.''
	   Rezal looked nervously at the hordes of police, some in red
helmets and riot gear, who had ringed the courthouse near the
city's Independence Square. He hastily departed before he had a
chance to break the vast gag order aimed at squelching public
discussion of the criminal charges.
	   ``Anwar will succeed in the case,'' said supporter M. Mohamed
Ibrahim, standing in front of the courthouse. ``He's a good
person.''

U.S envoy seeks end to Ethiopia-Eritrea border conflict
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ABEBE ANDUALEM &QC;

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ A former U.S. security adviser,
wrapping up two days of talks in Ethiopia, Thursday went to Eritrea
in a bid to settle the nations' six-month border dispute.
	   Anthony Lake, sent to northeastern Africa by President Bill
Clinton, made no comment on his private discussions with Ethiopian
officials, including Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   He also met with four Ethiopian religious leaders, recently back
from two days ago from Oslo, Norway, where they met with their
Eritrean counterparts under the auspices of Norwegian churches.
	   During his visit to Asmara, Lake planned to meet Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki, senior officials and religious leaders.
	   Lake was expected to return to the Ethiopian capital over the
weekend, U.S. officials said.
	   Although fighting between the two nations has subsided, both
sides have steadily massed troops and weapons along their border,
bracing for battles that threaten to erode stability throughout
northeast Africa.
	   Lake's mission is part of an ongoing effort by the Organization
of African Unity to peacefully settle the dispute, the State
Department said in a statement.
	   The OAU presented an 11-point peace proposal to the two sides in
Burkina Faso last weekend.
	   Ethiopia said Monday it accepted a key OAU proposal calling for
Eritrea to withdraw to positions it held before May 12, when
Ethiopian militia shot Eritrean soldiers they claimed had occupied
Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea again refused, saying it wants an international
monitoring force in place before it will withdraw troops from the
contested Badme and Shiraro areas.
	   ``The main issue that is blocking the peace process before and
now is Ethiopia's precondition of unconditional withdrawal of
Eritrean troops from Badme, which is an Eritrean territory,''
Eritrean Foreign Minister Haile Woldensae said at a news conference
in Asmara on Thursday.
	   The OAU gave Eritrea until the end of December to respond to its
proposals. The United States and Rwanda previously advanced a
similar plan.
	   Lake last visited Asmara and Addis Ababa on Oct. 7-8.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993, but the border between the two countries was
never officially declared.

Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Weather summary for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands from
the National Weather Service.
	   Showers and windy weather expected across the local area this
morning is forecast to worsen this evening and tonight, with
increasing northeast wind and heavy showers and squalls expected.
	   Strong high pressure at the surface continues to dominate the
west-central Atlantic today and is maintaining a strong northeast
trade wind flow across the region largely because of an old cold
front that has become stationary from the Leeward Islands northeast
into the Atlantic.
	   This pattern is forecast to continue through Friday morning
before decreasing.
	   Meanwhile, at the middle and upper levels of the atmosphere a
southwest- to northeast-aligned trough of low pressure has moved
southward into the northeast Caribbean since Wednesday afternoon,
with a low-pressure circulation developing within the trough.
	   This circulation center, which was located over the Atlantic
just northeast of the Anegada Passage early this morning, will move
southwest during the next 24 hours to greatly increase the amount
of showers and thunderstorms moving across our area.
	   Scattered showers moving through the Virgin Islands this morning
are expected to begin increasing late this afternoon or this
evening, with numerous bands and squalls overnight.
	   After scattered activity across Puerto Rico through the middle
of the afternoon, showers are then expected to increase beginning
across north and northeast sections and becoming widespread
overnight. Intermittent heavy rainfall will likely lead to flash
flooding and river flooding tonight.
	   A further increase in coastal winds and seas is expected this
afternoon and tonight and will build offshore Atlantic seas to 13
feet before wind and seas begin to diminish Friday.
	   Due to the major increase in weather expected this evening,
mariners can expect wind gusts to 45 knots in squalls.
	   Rough and dangerous marine conditions will be found both
offshore and near shore as strong northeast winds to 30 knots
combine with large breaking waves to produce extreme west currents
along the Atlantic coasts of our islands.
	   A heavy surf advisory is therefore in effect for all Atlantic
coasts and a coastal flood watch is in effect for north and
northwest Puerto Rico.

Russia and Japan show progress in settling WWII dispute

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leaders of Russia and Japan moved a few small
steps closer Thursday to resolving a land dispute that has
prevented them from formally signing a peace treaty to end World
War II.
	   Dealing from their respective strengths, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi of Japan opened his pocketbook, peeling off nearly dlrs 1
billion in loans and aid, while President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
opened his borders, just a crack, in signals of good will in the
dispute over the Kuril Islands.
	   The islands, just north of the main Japanese islands, were
seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Japan has
maintained that the seizure was illegal, and has refused to
recognize Russia's sovereignty over the islands.
	   The four Kurils are now so impoverished that some of their
17,000 Russian residents have taken up a petition asking that the
islands be handed over to Japan. But they are surrounded by prime
fishing grounds that are coveted by both nations.
	   In the first formal visit by a Japanese prime minister to Russia
in 25 years, Obuchi met Yeltsin at the Kremlin and was handed
Russia's long-awaited response to Japan's proposals to settle the
Kuril dispute.
	   The summit was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting since his
latest illness sidelined him a month ago. He was shown on Russian
television greeting the Japanese leader with a smile and handshake,
appearing somewhat steadier than he has in public recently.
	   No details of Yeltsin's plan were released, but Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said it called for ``joint economic
management'' of the islands.
	   Obuchi's spokesman, Sadaaki Numata, said Japan would have no
immediate response to the Russian proposal. But, he said, ``I think
we are solidly on the way ... to a peace treaty by 2000.''
	   He said Japan would formally respond at the next meeting of the
two leaders. He said Obuchi had invited Yeltsin to visit Japan ``at
the earliest opportunity'' in 1999, and Yeltsin had agreed.
	   In another step forward, the two leaders agreed to establish two
new subcommittees _ one to seek a solution to the territorial
dispute, and another to look into joint economic development of the
islands.
	   ``There is a very strong interest on the Japanese side about the
return of these islands,'' Numata said. ``There is a very keen
interest on the Russian side about the economic development or
activities on the islands. So we have these two committees working
... to meet these interests.''
	   Japan agreed to bankroll the economic development of the islands
with dlrs 100 million. It also agreed to free up dlrs 800 million
of a previously agreed-upon loan to Russia, and to give dlrs 10
million in medical assistance and dlrs 20 million to promote youth
exchange programs.
	   Russia, in turn, agreed to a sentimental Japanese request to
allow aging Japanese natives of the islands, driven out during the
war, to return and see their old homes.
	   Although the meeting produced progress, a final agreement is
expected to be a long, difficult process.
	   Tokyo received legal control of the islands now in contention _
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty
with Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing
days of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented
Tokyo's proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in
Japan in April. The proposals have not been made public.
	   According to media reports, Tokyo has suggested an arrangement
that would recognize Japanese sovereignty over the islands, but
would allow Russia to retain control for some time.

Albania fears `dangerous vacuum' in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ Albania Thursday warned that a ``dangerous
vacuum'' existed in Kosovo and called for the international
community to push harder for a solution.
	   ``There is a dangerous vacuum. It is neither war nor peace,''
said Albanian Prime Minister Pandeli Majko of the situation in the
Yugoslav province.
	   Meeting with Greek Premier Costas Simitis, Majko called for
``immediate intervention'' by the international community so that
``a solution could reached by giving (Kosovo) a temporary status.''
	   Majko did not elaborate, but his talks focused on returning a
degree of autonomy to the province, where ethnic Albanian
separatists have been fighting Serb security forces.
	   Several hundred other people, mostly ethnic Albanians, have been
killed since fighting flared in February, and as many as 300,000
driven from their homes. Violence has continued past the Oct. 12
agreement calling for an end to the security crackdown.
	   Majko also signed a series of agreements to help staunch the
flow of illegal immigrants to Greece, boost trade between the two
neighbors, and go ahead with a dlrs 70 million Greek loan program.
	   Greece wants to help Albania reorganize its shattered police
force so that it try to stem the flow of illegal immigrants. Nearly
half-a-million Albanians are thought to be living here.
	   Both also signed a deal for Greece to help build a new national
theater in downtown Tirana.
	   ``Our meeting is a sign of improving friendship and cooperation
between our two peoples,'' Premier Costas Simitis told a joint news
conference.
	   Greece provides wide ranging assistance to its neighbor, which
emerged from decades of Communist isolation in 1991 as the poorest
country in Europe.
	   Simitis said Greece was willing to help Albania forge closer
ties with NATO, the European Union ``and any other international
organizations it chooses.''

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ The Israeli army opened gas mask distribution
centers Thursday in preparation for a possible attack by Iraq,
though a senior adviser to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
Israel had a ``close to zero'' chance of being targeted.
	   The Palestinians, meanwhile, urged the United States to exhaust
the diplomatic option. ``I hope and urge that there will not be an
attack against Iraq,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The
Jerusalem Post. ``Peace in the Middle East will be negatively
affected by a U.S. attack.''
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War, during which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However,
the Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with top ministers
Thursday to discuss Israeli preparedness for a possible U.S. strike
that might trigger an Iraqi attack on Israel.
	   At a news conference Thursday Netanyahu said ``a real crisis is
developing,'' between the U.S. and Iraq. Asked if he had a gas
mask, Netanyahu said ``I think so. I haven't checked. It's one of
the problems when you have to get one of these things out of the
closet.''
	   Netanyahu's adviser David Bar-Illan said Israel believed chances
for an Iraqi retaliatory attack were slim but the country was
taking no chances.
	   ``We feel that the chances of any kind of attack are ... close
to zero, but as long as there is any possibility at all, we have to
be prepared,'' he said.

Olympic gymnastics champ turns 100

	   GRAD OTOCEC, Slovenia (AP) _ Six-time gymnastics medalist Leon
Stukelj, the oldest living Olympian, turned 100 in style Thursday
with celebratory events across Slovenia and a visit from the head
of the Olympic movement.
	   Juan Antonio Samaranch, chief of the International Olympic
Committee, was the first guest of honor at Stukelj's birthday gala,
and was to give a speech about him Thursday evening.
	   Fighting a cold, Stukelj missed the opening in his hometown of
Maribor of an exhibition of rewards and photos that he collected
through years.
	   But he did appear later in Grad Otocec, a picturesque city on an
island on the Krka river.
	   Later, a ceremony was planned on the main square in Novo Mesto,
where Stukelj was born in 1898. A gala gymnastic event was
scheduled in his honor in the city's sports hall afterward.
	   ``For many more years to come'' is inscribed in the copy of an
ancient Roman glass, one of many birthday presents.
	   Stukelj won Olympic golds in the horizontal bar and all-around
competition at Paris in 1924 and in the rings at Amsterdam in 1928.
He also won two bronze medals at Amsterdam, in the all-around and
team exercises, and a silver in the rings at Berlin in 1936.
	   He was so good that one of his trademark moves is still known as
the Stukelj maneuver.
	   Stukelj went on to work as a judge and also wrote books on
gymnastics. He remains involved in Slovene sports life, and has
kept up his health by working out on rings in his apartment and by
taking hour-long walks in a a nearby park.

South Africa concerned over citizen held hostage in Nigeria

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with 10 employees abducted, rig belongs to Texaco,
demands by kidnappers; no pickup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ The South African government on
Thursday expressed concern about the fate of a South African
citizen and nine others held hostage in Nigeria.
	   The petroleum workers were abducted on Wednesday from a Texaco
oil rig in the oil producing region near Warri, in the Niger Delta
in southeastern Nigeria, the foreign affairs office said.
	   ``This region has in recent times become volatile as local
ethnic groups pursue their campaign for increased revenues from the
Nigerian Government and multinational petroleum companies operating
in the region,'' the office said.
	   The kidnappers ``left a note with some demands addressed to
Texaco,'' said ministry spokeswoman Adri Kronje. She did not
specify the demands.
	   One of the victims was Nigerian, but the nationalities of the
others were unknown.
	   South African officials in the Nigerian capital of Lagos were in
close contact with the company and the government, the ministry
said.

Show of solidarity may not be enough to rebuild Central America

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Celebrities are arriving and
governments are promising millions of dollars, but it's far from
clear whether the show of solidarity will be enough to rebuild
Central America after Hurricane Mitch.
	   The storm that killed 10,000 people has set back the region's
development by years, and many Central Americans say they have seen
little sign of the promised foreign aid.
	   A U.N. agency announced Thursday it was boosting deliveries of
food aid to Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, which
were devastated by mudslides and floods. The Rome-based World Food
Program said it would distribute 116,238 tons of rice, corn, fish
and oil over the next six months.
	   ``With emergency assistance, these people are at extreme
nutritional risk _ in addition to facing the threat of cholera and
other diseases from unsanitary conditions throughout the region,''
said Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive director.
	   As well as the United Nations, governments around the world have
promised hundreds of millions of dollars in relief.
	   Yet with so much of Central America in ruins, the aid announced
so far is likely to fall well short of the need. In Honduras alone,
the Inter-American Development Bank has estimated that up to 90
percent of the country's roads and other infrastructure were
destroyed.
	   On Wednesday, Tipper Gore wrapped up a visit to the region with
a promise to repeat victims' stories of suffering so the world
would send more help.
	   The wife of Vice President Al Gore flew home to Washington after
spending two days in the ravaged Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa
and in Managua, where she joined an assembly line filling aid
packages and distributing supplies to homeless refugees.
	   ``The eyes of the children are filled with hope,'' Mrs. Gore
said at Managua's Ciudad Sandino camp, where thousands flocked
after Mitch swept their homes into an overflowing river. ``All we
can do is tell the world of the devastation here so they can
help.''
	   Mrs. Gore was part of a first wave of foreign visitors arriving
to survey the devastation caused by Mitch, which began Oct. 22 and
hit the region with hurricane winds three days later.
	   Other visitors include Colombian First Lady Nohra Pastrana, who
arrived in Managua as Mrs. Gore's plane was taking off. Hillary
Rodham Clinton and French President Jacques Chirac are planning to
visit to the region next week.
	   Bianca Jagger, the ex-wife of Rolling Stones singer Mick Jagger,
returned to her native Nicaragua on Wednesday with 60,000 pounds of
medicine and food for storm victims.
	   Spain's Prince Felipe plans to visit Honduras later this week to
bring aid and survey damage.
	   Before leaving Managua, Mrs. Gore announced the United States
would add dlrs 1.5 million in medical aid and send 12 more
helicopters to help those already flying relief supplies to
isolated areas.
	   After meeting with Aleman, Mrs. Gore helped volunteers heap
beans, rice and milk packages into plastic bags for distribution to
disaster victims.
	   Mrs. Gore was joined on her trip by Brian Atwood, who heads the
U.S. Agency for International Development, Nicaraguan pitcher
Dennis Martinez of the Atlanta Braves baseball team and John
Leonard, deputy assistant secretary of state for Latin America.
	   Martinez was greeted with warm cheers as he and Mrs. Gore handed
out toilet paper and water bottles at the Ciudad Sandino refugee
camp. He urged his countrymen to begin rebuilding on their own and
not to wait for foreign help.
	   Elizabeth Dole, head of the American Red Cross, also was in
Central America this week to survey damage and help in the relief
effort. She left Managua on Wednesday to return to the United
States.

Bulgaria to cut VAT from 22 to 20 percent
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SOFIA, Bulgaria (AP) _ Bulgaria will slash its flat-rate value
added tax by 2 percent to 20 percent next year in hopes of
encouraging investment, legislators decided Thursday.
	   The government-proposed cut was approved by a vote of 127 in
favor, 51 of the 240 legislators against. Thirty-three lawmakers
abstained.
	   The parliament also approved levying VAT on bread, milk and milk
products, as of early next year. Opposition lawmakers protested the
decision, arguing that it will hurt worst the majority of people
with low incomes.
	   Bulgarian Finance Minister Muravei Radev agreed the new tax will
cause a ``temporary increase of prices'' of the basic foods.
	   An 18-percent VAT was introduced in Bulgaria for the first time
in 1994. Two years later the tax rate was increased to 22 percent.
	   The government is trying to encourage economic growth after
years of recession and fiscal austerity. The gross domestic product
is expected to grow by 4 percent this year, according to official
forecasts.

Arab ministers hold Iraq responsible for defying United Nations

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Arab foreign ministers on Thursday held Iraq
responsible for the consequences of refusing to cooperate with
United Nations weapons inspectors.
	   ``The Iraqi government is held responsible for any consequences
that might arise from its refusal to back down from its decision to
expel the U.N. weapons inspectors which will expose the innocent
Iraqi people to more miseries and tragedies,'' said the final
communique of a meeting of the ministers from eight Arab countries.
	   The foreign ministers from Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states
called on Iraq to fully cooperate with the weapons inspectors
according to U.N. resolutions.
	   The statement expressed hope that ``wisdom and reason prevail so
that the United Nations can reach a diplomatic solution to the
crisis.''
	   The statement appeared to be a warning to Iraq that it should
not count on Arab support in its dispute with the United Nations.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military strikes
if Baghdad does not rescind its refusal to cooperate with the arms
inspectors.
	   All of the 90 U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq Wednesday as the
possibility of a strike increased. Many U.N. relief workers have
also been evacuated.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the
statement of the Arab foreign ministers in Doha ``reflects the
growing and near unanimity, especially in the Arab world, that Iraq
is responsible solely for the consequences.''
	   The U.N. resolutions say that international sanctions against
Iraq will not be lifted until weapons inspectors dismantle Iraqi
programs to build weapons of mass destruction and set up a
monitoring system to ensure that such programs cannot be restarted.
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   During the two-day conference, the Arab foreign ministers also
discussed the Middle East peace accord and the Syrian-Turkish
agreement over Kurdish separatists.
	   The two-day conference is the first meeting of the so-called
Damascus-8 since July 1997. The group normally meets twice a year,
but it canceled a meeting last December after a row between Egypt
and Qatar.
	   By the Damascus Declaration of 1991, Egypt and Syria pledged to
defend the security of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and Gulf states promised to give
aid to the Cairo and Damascus governments.

Arafat urges U.S. restraint, says attack would hurt Mideast peace
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SAMAR ASSAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) _ Yasser Arafat urged the United States
to exercise restraint Thursday and avoid striking at Iraq, a move
the Palestinian leader said would be detrimental to Mideast peace.
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   ``I hope and urge that there will not be an attack against
Iraq,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told The Jerusalem Post.
``Peace in the Middle East will be negatively affected by a U.S.
attack.''
	   Hassan Asfour, a senior Palestinian negotiator said that an
attack on a fellow Arab nation by the current sponsor of the
Mideast peace process would wipe away any sense of hope among
Palestinian people for peace.
	   During the Gulf War, there was widespread Palestinian support
for the Iraqi attacks on Israel and mild street support during
subsequent crises.
	   ``If the street goes out and denounces America for the strike,
the Palestinian Authority would be in a difficult position when
working with the U.S. on the peace process.''
	   ``The Palestinian Authority would have to say it is against the
American action and it will all be an awkward position,'' Asfour
said.
	   In a Wednesday meeting with Israeli journalists, Arafat said he
was optimistic that the current crisis over U.N. weapons
inspections could still be resolved through diplomacy.

Malaysia's high-tech plans jarred by politics, capital curbs
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH EDWIN &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysia's digital dream of
transforming its economy with information technology is crumbling,
as controversy surrounding the jailing of the deputy prime minister
and new capital controls takes its toll.
	   Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad had hoped to showcase Malaysia's
high-technology capabilities at the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation summit, which began with senior officials meeting
Thursday.
	   He will play host to leaders of the 21-nation group at a special
retreat next week at ``Cyberjaya,'' the cybercity at the center of
the Malaysia's plans.
	   But the arrest and trial of his former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim,
are causing some major players to rethink their involvement in one
of Mahathir's biggest projects, the Multimedia Super Corridor.
	   The MSC, fashioned after Silicon Valley in the United States,
was designed to be the epicenter for the country's new economy.
Currently under construction, it is envisaged as a center for chip
manufacturing, software development, Internet technologies and the
like.
	   Some Malaysians, though, are using computer technology,
especially the Internet, to organize dissent against the
72-year-old Mahathir.
	   Foreigners are also unhappy. Influential high-tech advocates
Alvin Toffler and Kenichi Ohmae, author of ``The Borderless
World,'' have resigned from the international advisory panel on the
MSC. In letters to Mahathir, they expressed their disappointment
over the treatment of Anwar.
	   Toffler warned that Malaysia's plans for the high-tech project
were running aground in a commentary published in the International
Herald Tribune last month.
	   ``Mahathir cannot expect the world's greatest high-technology
companies and leaders, to whom he promised complete freedom of
information and a host of other guarantees, to help bring the
digital future to his country while his police throw his former
protege into jail,'' Toffler wrote.
	   The Anwar affair hit the headlines of the world's newspapers
when he was presented in court with a black eye, claiming he was
beaten by police.
	   He is now being tried on charges of corruption and illegal
homosexual acts. Anwar says those allegations are a political ploy
to crush any threat to Mahathir's 17-year leadership.
	   Capital controls imposed in early September have also hurt the
project. These curbed short-term capital flows, and pegged the
Malaysian currency at 3.80 ringgit to the dollar.
	   But the government maintains that interest in the Multimedia
Super Corridor is still increasing, despite Malaysia's deepening
political and economic uncertainties.
	   Malaysia's recession ``has not in any way derailed efforts to
push strongly ahead with the Multimedia Super Corridor,'' Othman
Yeop Abdullah, executive director of the dlrs 4 billion project,
wrote in his latest newsletter.
	   He hopes for 500 companies to be part of the project by the year
2020, and says 235 had applied by August to play a role.
	   Chan Kong Choy, deputy minister for energy, communications and
multimedia, says only 19 of 186 companies so far granted Multimedia
Super Corridor status are actually operating.
	   The rest, he says, ``are not prepared'' to set up shop. However,
no companies have withdrawn from the project yet.
	   Nevertheless, industry experts have different ideas.
	   ``Certainly, there'll be some effect due to capital controls and
political uncertainties,'' Shaifubahrim Saleh, chairman the
Association of the Computer Industry Malaysia, told Dow Jones
Newswires. ``The big corporations in the U.S. will be concerned
over the latest developments.''
	   The political upheaval, which triggered the first riots in the
country in nearly three decades and has seen hundreds of Anwar
sympathizers arrested, worries investors. The main danger is that
Malaysia's pledge to allow a free flow of information may not hold.
	   In May, the government warned financial analysts against issuing
negative reports on the economy, and fired a couple of local
editors in July for questioning Mahathir's economic policies and
supporting Anwar's views.
	   Television stations were warned that they could be taken off the
air for broadcasting negative reports, such as about the haze that
shrouded much of country.
	   The Internet has also been affected.
	   Four Malaysians were arrested in August for allegedly spreading
rumors of riots by electronic mail. The four were detained under
the harsh Internal Security Act, which allows for detention without
trial.
	   Lim Kit Siang, an opposition leader and information technology
aficionado, says the government has lost its focus on the Super
Corridor because of its preoccupation with the political and
economic turmoil.
	   ``It's a question of whether the government will be able to
deliver in terms of creating conditions for the information age,''
said Lim. ``You need freedom of speech for creative energy to
thrive.''
	   Meanwhile, it's not just Malaysia's problems that are deterring
potential investors. The whole proposition of Malaysia as the
information technology hub of Southeast Asia is looking dubious as
the whole region struggles to come to terms with the Asian economic
crisis.
	   Unnerved by the uncertainty, foreigners have been slow to
invest. In Malaysia alone, total capital investment reached dlrs
5.6 billion in the first nine months of the year, according to
official figures, compared with dlrs 6.8 billion for all of 1997.

Sandinista leader for first time denies abusing stepdaughter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Nicaragua's former president, Daniel
Ortega, for the first time has flatly denied his stepdaughter's
charges that he raped and abused her.
	   ``What she has been saying is totally false,'' the Sandinista
leader said in a local television interview broadcast Wednesday
night.
	   Until now, Ortega had called the allegations by Zoilamerica
Ortega Murillo a ``conspiracy,'' but had left it to his wife
Rosario and other relatives to actually deny them.
	   Ortega Murillo, who turns 31 this week, charged early this year
that Ortega began molesting her starting at age 11. She filed a
criminal complaint against Ortega, but it was frozen by the courts
because Ortega enjoys immunity from prosecution as a member of the
country's congress.
	   ``Clearly she is lying,'' Ortega said when asked if his
stepdaughter was a liar. ``All the accusations which have been
hurled are lies,'' he said.
	   ``She knows all the affection that I had for her and that I
demonstrated, the affection that she herself showed toward me,''
Ortega said, calling the woman's accusations ``inexplicable.''
	   Ortega was the leader of the leftist Sandinista Front when he
served as Nicaragua's president from 1979 to 1990. He lost
presidential elections in 1990 and in 1996. He remains the party's
secretary general.

Georgia's president declares war on tax dodgers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ President Eduard Shevardnadze on
Thursday declared a ``war'' on tax dodgers, telling his government
to treat them like terrorists in an attempt to close a chronic
budget deficit.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Chkuaseli said the Georgian government
owed 12 million lari (dlrs 9 million) in back wages to state
workers and 48 million lari (dlrs 36 million) in pensions.
	   Millions of people in most former Soviet republics are being
paid months late because governments cannot collect enough taxes to
cover even basic expenses.
	   ``We are declaring a was on those who do not pay taxes,''
Shevardnadze said. ``Treat them as if they were terrorists. ... Tax
evasion is budget terrorism.''
	   ``That is my task for you,'' Shevardnadze told a meeting of
financial officials.

Resignation across Arab world over American attack on Iraq
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES with Qatar statement, more quotes.
 &UR; With BC-Iraq-UN
 &UR; By ANTHONY SHADID &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ The last time the United States sent an
armada to attack Iraq, the defiance in Baghdad was perhaps matched
only by the outrage in the rest of the Arab world.
	   Hundreds of Palestinians paraded a model of an Iraqi Scud
missile and chanted ``Beloved Saddam, Hit Tel Aviv.'' Yemenis
jumped off buses to join anti-American protests and police had to
use attack dogs to keep demonstrators in Jordan at bay.
	   It's a different mood today.
	   In a remarkable statement Thursday, eight Arab states declared
that Iraq would be ``held responsible for any consequences'' of its
Oct. 31 decision to halt the activities of U.N. inspectors charged
with destroying Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   The countries expressed hope, too, that ``wisdom and reason
prevail'' so as not to worsen hardships for Iraqis already made
miserable by U.N. sanctions _ a concern voiced across the region.
	   The statement was the clearest sign that in contrast to the
anger that coursed through the region during the last crisis, a
sense of resignation prevails that an attack may be inevitable now.
	   ``Kuwait cannot stop a superpower from taking certain steps,''
said Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti foreign minister.
	   Twenty-five more U.N. employees left Iraq on Thursday, joining
233 U.N. inspectors and relief workers who departed a day earlier _
a move widely seen as a sign an American strike may be imminent.
	   And few in the region believe Iraq is prepared to back down.
	   ``The question now is what will this strike be like? What will
its size be and what will be the end?'' asked columnist Abdullah
al-Shayegi in Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper Thursday.
	   That perception of fait accompli was echoed in Al-Wafd, Egypt's
most popular opposition newspaper. Its banner headline on Thursday
read, ``The countdown begins for the strike on Iraq.''
	   No Arab government would endorse an attack on Iraq, a
politically disastrous move that would run the risk of further
inflaming widespread public anger at Washington's steadfast support
of Israel and encouraging sympathy for the Iraqi people.
	   Since the buildup began, nearly all Arab countries have voiced
support for diplomacy over war, warning that an attack would bring
_ as Qatar's foreign minister put it _ ``further catastrophes.''
	   But the diplomacy seems to be less active _ and less vocal.
	   During the last crisis with Iraq in February, Arab League
Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid took the unusual step of
flying to Baghdad to meet President Saddam Hussein. This time, from
Cairo, he urged the Iraqis to show ``flexibility.''
	   The softer tones in Arab capitals may not be coincidence.
Defense Secretary William Cohen told Arab leaders on his tour this
month of the Gulf, Egypt and Jordan that if the governments did not
agree with an attack, they should keep the criticism to themselves,
said Arab diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity.
	   Resentment remains, though, at what many Arabs see as the double
standard in Washington's prosecution of the sanctions against Iraq
and its patience with Israel in the peace process.
	   ``This duplicity in American policy, the flagrant hostility to
Arab rights and the extreme bias in favor of Israel has proven that
the American administration has no credibility,'' said Tishrin, a
Syrian newspaper that speaks for the government.

Underdog Celta seeks leadership with win over Real Madrid
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JOHANNA TUCKMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ It's 50 years since modest Celta last beat
giant Real Madrid at the hallowed Santiago Bernabeu stadium.
Another such victory this weekend would be all the sweeter as it
could shift the underdog up to the top of the Spanish soccer
league.
	   Back in 1948 Celta trounced Madrid 4-0. Since then it has more
often been on the losing end in its bouts against the perennial
Spanish powerhouse.
	   But so far this season, Celta has notched up its longest ever
unbeaten record, winning four and drawing five matches, and morale
is running high as the squad prepares for Saturday's battle for the
leadership.
	   A little-known team from northwestern Spain, Celta now has 17
points and the best goal difference in the 20-team division. Known
for its attacking style it lies at No. 3, just one point down from
Madrid and two behind Mallorca, the only other unbeaten team.
	   Madrid, meanwhile, has the chance to redeem itself after last
week's 1-1 draw against struggling Alaves and snatch back the
leadership it lost to Mallorca.
	   Real will be without defense anchorman Fernando Hierro, the only
constantly praised player behind the squad's formidable line in
international star strikers but who looks set to be out for at
least one month due to injury.
	   Hierro is one of the seven Madrid candidates for Europe's Golden
Ball award for best player. Other candidates from the team are Raul
Gonzalez, Roberto Carlos, Pedrag Mijatovic, Davor Suker, Clarence
Seedorf and Robert Jarni.
	   Among other matches in this week's 10th round, all scheduled for
Sunday, FC Barcelona's draw against humble Tenerife has been billed
as a chance for Dutch coach Louis Van Gaal to halt his slide toward
dismissal.
	   Barcelona is currently at No. 4 in the league with 16 points and
facing possible elimination from European soccer.
	   ``For me life doesn't stop with one defeat,'' leading daily El
Pais quoted Van Gaal as saying Thursday. But the problem is there
hasn't been just one, but three consecutive defeats.
	   The last came Tuesday with a 2-0 loss in a friendly against
Swedish team Helsingborgs with Barcelona still suffering from
losing 2-1 to Oviedo at its weekend Spanish league game and reeling
from losing 2-1 to Bayern Munich in the European Champions Cup.
	   ``I wouldn't be surprised if we see white handkerchiefs on
Sunday,'' said Barcelona defender and Spanish international Albert
Celades in reference to fans' habit of waving white handkerchiefs
when they are unhappy.
	   ``It isn't enough to win, we also have to convince,'' Celades
said in reference to the storm of criticism of Van Gaal's team that
stretches to style as well as results and comes from a wide range
of sources including venerated former coach Johan Cruyff.
	   In other draws Sunday, Mallorca, the other season's surprise
along with Celta, sets out to defend its leadership position in an
away match against mid-table Valladolid.
	   Mallorca has played a tight season. A relatively lackluster
attack has only scored 12 goals, but has been more than compensated
by a defense and star goalkeeper Carlos Roa of Argentina who have
only let in three.
	   Also Sunday Atletico de Madrid, at No. 7, travels to play
second-last Villareal with Italian coach Arrigo Sacchi concerned
about the team's away record.
	   ``Away from the Calderon stadium we have tended to be unusually
fragile and stuck, losing our aggressiveness, joy and confidence,''
Sacchi told Marca.
	   In other 10th-round draws, midtable Deportivo de La Coruna
welcomes division newcomer Alaves _ the team with most yellow and
red cards _34_ this season.
	   Athletic de Bilbao hosts Oviedo, Betis takes on Real Sociedad
and Zaragoza welcomes Espanyol while Salamanca travels to play
Racing de Santander and Valencia plays away against Extremadura.

Three hurt in accident at Thailand's Asian Games rehearsal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A rehearsal of the opening ceremony for
December's Asian Games went badly awry Thursday night when three
schoolboys were run over by a motorized rickshaw taking part in the
show.
	   Two of the boys were taken to a hospital, while the other was
treated at the stadium's clinic. Their condition was not known.
	   The rickshaw, or ``tuk-tuk'' _ a ubiquitous form of transport in
Bangkok _ was pulling a large float that will be used in the Dec. 6
opening ceremony of the games among competitors from some 40
countries.
	   Several hundred primary school students were on the playing
field as the tuk-tuk roared into the center of the stadium,
injuring the three boys who did not manage to get out of the way.
	   Despite the accident, the show went on with about a third of the
70,000 seats filled, mostly with students who were brought to the
site by buses. The show, reflecting aspects of Thai culture, was
the first rehearsal opened to the public.
	   ``I'm very pleased with the show and I would like to give many
youngsters the opportunity to come and witness the event,'' said
Deputy Prime Minister Bhichai Rattakul, who is chairman of the
Bangkok Asian Games Organizing Committee.
	   Bhichai told reporters that he has instructed the committee to
charge students just 50 baht (dlrs 1.39) and their parents 100 baht
(dlrs 2.78) each to attend the actual opening ceremony. Adults
unaccompanied by children will be charged 1,000-5,000 baht (dlrs
27-139) for their tickets.
	   ``I told the committee not to worry too much about the revenue.
What I want is a successful games,'' he said.

Israeli warplanes raid guerrilla bases in south Lebanon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NABATIYEH, Lebanon (AP) _ Israeli warplanes blasted suspected
guerrilla bases in southern Lebanon on Thursday in the fifth such
attack in as many days.
	   The Israeli jets fired four missiles at the abandoned village of
Aqmata in Iqlim al-Tuffah, a stronghold of Iranian-backed guerrilla
group, Hezbollah, Lebanese security officials said.
	   Black smoke billowed from the area, which faces an
Israeli-occupied zone and lies 12 kilometers (seven miles) north of
the market town of Nabatiyeh.
	   Half a hour later more Israeli planes fired two missiles at
targets near Zibqine, a village 35 kilometers (21 miles) southwest
of Nabatiyeh.
	   There was no immediate word of casualties from the sunset raids,
the officials said, speaking on customary condition of anonymity.
	   In Jerusalem, the Israeli military said in a statement that
their planes had attacked ``targets of terrorists in the east and
west section of south Lebanon.
	   ``The pilots reported direct hits. All warplanes returned safely
to their bases,'' the statement added.
	   Israeli planes have raided suspected Hezbollah positions in
southern Lebanon each day since Sunday.
	   Hezbollah, or Party of God, leads a guerrilla war to oust 1,500
Israeli soldiers and 2,500 allied Lebanese militiamen from the
occupied zone that Israel set up in 1985 to prevent cross-border
attacks.

France requests Pinochet's extradition
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities on Thursday officially asked
Britain to extradite former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet so he
can face charges related to the disappearance of French citizens.
	   A Justice Ministry statement said the extradition request was
handed to British authorities via the French Foreign Ministry.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish extradition
warrant citing charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping during
his 17-year rule, which began in 1973 when he toppled Salvador
Allende, an elected Marxist.
	   A French judge handling the cases of three French citizens who
disappeared after Pinochet took power had asked French authorities
to file an extradition request.
	   A French court then sent a temporary arrest warrant for Pinochet
to British authorities, accusing him of ``sequestration followed by
torture.''
	   It was the final step necessary before France could officially
ask for his extradition.
	   In Britain Thursday, prosecutors wrapped up their appeal of a
court ruling allowing Pinochet immunity from prosecution in
Britain, arguing that the crimes against humanity he is charged
with ``unequivocally'' violate international law.
	   A report by Chile's government says about 3,000 people were
killed or disappeared at the hands of secret police under Pinochet.
Chile, however, has protested his arrest, saying it strains the
country's democracy, carefully built since the general stepped down
in 1990.

Police fire plastic bullets and tear gas to break up student

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with student injury toll at least 110, graf 3 &QL;

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot officers fired plastic bullets,
tear gas and water cannons Thursday at thousands of students during
the biggest day of protests so far against a government assembly on
political reform.
	   Students fought back, hurling bottles and chunks of concrete at
police in helmets who chased and beat them with canes. Adding to
the nighttime chaos in central Jakarta, military-backed civilian
guards flailed with sharpened bamboo sticks at bystanders.
	   At least 110 students were badly injured, medical staff and
human rights groups said. Several hospitals said about a dozen were
in a critical condition with plastic bullet wounds. One police
officer was reported injured.
	   The violence showed the divisions that Indonesia faces as it
edges toward democracy after 32 years of authoritarian rule, with
students pressing for sweeping change and the government urging a
slower pace.
	   The student rallies turned violent after vastly outnumbered
police and soldiers failed to hold back marchers, many chanting
``Let us through'' and waving red and white Indonesian flags.
	   On two main roads near Parliament, students scattered as
officers fired shots but later regrouped. Security forces had been
ordered to carry blanks and plastic bullets.
	   Up to 20,000 people had tried to march to Parliament, where the
nation's highest legislative body met to craft rules for 1999
parliamentary elections. Students accuse the 1,000-member People's
Consultative Assembly of trying to hinder reforms.
	   Fearing violence, banks, shops and offices had closed their
doors and sent workers home early. Streets in the usually
traffic-clogged, tropical capital were clear.
	   The mood recalled deadly riots in May that shook Jakarta and
helped oust former President Suharto, a former army general who
rose to power in the 1960s.
	   This week, several protests have ended in violence pitting
students against riot police and civilian guards hired to safeguard
the assembly.
	   In a move likely to further anger students, government leaders
said that general elections were likely to be delayed until July,
two months later than President B.J. Habibie had promised.
	   Marzuki Darusman, a leader of the ruling Golkar party, cited
tie-ups in drafting electoral laws.
	   Activists are skeptical that assembly delegates are willing to
shake off their legacy as Suharto proteges and implement democratic
reforms.
	   Convening in the green-domed legislative building, delegates
debated whether to escalate an investigation of Suharto, who is
accused of human rights abuses and enriching his family at state
expense.
	   An investigation of Suharto's business holdings is under way,
but government prosecutors say they have found no evidence of
wrongdoing.
	   Students say the government, which is filled with former Suharto
loyalists, is too compromised by its links to the former president
to properly investigate him.
	   Earlier, as students in brightly colored university jackets made
their way to Parliament, they shouted slogans including, ``Habibie
must step down and Suharto must take responsibility.''
	   Thousands of people stood by, watching the marchers and
occasionally clapping and cheering. The students took a circuitous
route along main roads, some in densely populated poor areas.
	   ``We will keep on protesting if our demands are not fulfilled,''
said demonstrator Lufti.
	   Some 30,000 police and soldiers are on duty in the capital this
week.
	   Habibie, who has legalized political parties and made other
democratic reforms, opened the four-day assembly meeting Tuesday.
Critics suspect that Habibie, who is expected to run for president
next year, may be maneuvering to consolidate his power.
	   Factions of the assembly, which includes all 500 national
legislators as well as presidential appointees, are also discussing
whether to scale back the armed forces' prominent role in politics.
	   Students want the military, which has 75 appointed seats in the
500-seat Parliament, to be banned altogether from the chamber.
	   The unrest in May erupted after military personnel fatally shot
four student protesters. The tumult was fueled by discontent over
Indonesia's worst economic crisis in decades.

Arab ministers hold Iraq responsible for defying United Nations
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEADS to update with diplomats saying foreign ministers'
message also directed to the United States. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Arab foreign ministers on Thursday held Iraq
responsible for the consequences of refusing to cooperate with
United Nations weapons inspectors.
	   They also urged that ``wisdom and reason prevail,'' but
specifically did not mention any party to the conflict.
	   But diplomats attending a conference in Doha, Qatar, said the
message was directed to both Iraq and the United States.
	   ``The Iraqi government is held responsible for any consequences
that might arise from its refusal to back down from its decision to
expel the U.N. weapons inspectors which will expose the innocent
Iraqi people to more miseries and tragedies,'' said the final
communique of the meeting of the ministers from eight Arab
countries.
	   The foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states called
on Iraq to fully cooperate with the weapons inspectors according to
U.N. resolutions.
	   The statement expressed hope that ``wisdom and reason prevail so
that the United Nations can reach a diplomatic solution to the
crisis.''
	   The statement appeared to be a warning to Iraq that it should
not count on Arab support in its dispute with the United Nations.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military strikes
if Baghdad does not rescind its refusal to cooperate with the arms
inspectors.
	   All of the 90 U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq Wednesday as the
possibility of a strike increased. Many U.N. relief workers have
also been evacuated.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the
statement of the Arab foreign ministers in Doha ``reflects the
growing and near unanimity, especially in the Arab world, that Iraq
is responsible solely for the consequences.''
	   The U.N. resolutions say that international sanctions against
Iraq will not be lifted until weapons inspectors dismantle Iraqi
programs to build weapons of mass destruction and set up a
monitoring system to ensure that such programs cannot be restarted.
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   During the two-day conference, the Arab foreign ministers also
discussed the Middle East peace accord and the Syrian-Turkish
agreement over Kurdish separatists.
	   The two-day conference is the first meeting of the so-called
Damascus-8 since July 1997. The group normally meets twice a year,
but it canceled a meeting last December after a row between Egypt
and Qatar.
	   By the Damascus Declaration of 1991, Egypt and Syria pledged to
defend the security of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and Gulf states promised to give
aid to the Cairo and Damascus governments.

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ A senior tourism official joined
hoteliers and business representatives in expressing concern
Thursday about TAP Air Portugal's plans to cut some international
and domestic services and reschedule others.
	   Secretary of State for Tourism Vitor Neto said he was
``extremely concerned'' about the effect on tourism of flight
changes to northern city Oporto and to the southern Algarve region.
	   Hoteliers in the Algarve, a mass market destination, are
protesting the airline's winter schedules which they claim are
inconvenient for travelers from northern Europe.
	   Business leaders in the north of the country, which relies on
Oporto airport, say Air Portugal's decision to cut flights to nine
European cities and to Brazil will hinder the region's economic
development.
	   Tourism is a major source of revenue for Portugal.
	   Air Portugal, currently engaged in a state-funded restructuring
program to lift it out of debt, says the changes were for economic
reasons and pointed out it was increasing services between Oporto
and four other European cities.
	   The airline is scheduled for privatization next year. It posted
a profit of 1.5 billion escudos (dlrs 8.7 million) last year, its
first profit since 1974.
	   It carried 4.16 million passengers in 1997.

Newspaper wins dispute over publication of new diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Name Germ in 9th graf is cq. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch newspaper was vindicated
Thursday for publishing three recently discovered pages of Anne
Frank's classic diary after a court said a printed apology was
unnecessary.
	   The lawsuit was brought by the Basel, Switzerland-based Anne
Frank Fund, which holds the copyright to the best-selling ``Diary
of Anne Frank'' by the young Jewish girl who hid with her family
from the Nazis.
	   It claimed that Het Parool, an Amsterdam daily, published the
pages without its consent and had acted illegally. The group wanted
Het Parool to print a rectification on its front page and stop
quoting from the new pages or send copies to other media.
	   But in a written decision, an Amsterdam District Court judge
rejected that request and ordered the Swiss organization to pay the
newspaper's court costs.
	   ``The decision is good for the freedom of the press,'' said
Willem van Manen, a lawyer for the newspaper.
	   The diary pages appeared on the front page of Het Parool on Aug.
26, and later on its Internet site. The newspaper ran them within
days of a Dutch scholar's startling announcement that he had five
previously unknown handwritten pages he said Anne's father gave him
shortly before his death in 1980.
	   Het Parool contended it had adhered to copyright rules because
the pages ordinarily would have been published along with the rest
of the famed diary if Otto Frank hadn't kept them separate from the
rest of the manuscript.
	   Their sheer newsworthiness also justified the publication, the
paper argued.
	   Germ Kemper, a lawyer for the Anne Frank Fund, said the court
has clearly put news reporting before the interests of copyright
holders. ``Copyright holders need to be protected from unauthorized
publications,'' he said.
	   The diary controversy began in August, when longtime Frank
family friend Cor Suijk revealed the existence of the pages, in
which Anne criticized her parents' marriage.
	   Anne and her family fled Nazi Germany before World War II and
hid in a secret annex in an Amsterdam canal house from July 1942
until they were betrayed in August 1944.
	   Aspired to be a writer, Anne chronicled their cramped existence
in her diary, which was published posthumously. It has been
translated from Dutch into more than 50 languages and has sold
millions of copies worldwide.
	   Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in March 1945,
just three months before her 16th birthday.

Arab ministers hold Iraq responsible for defying United Nations

	   DOHA, Qatar (AP) _ Arab foreign ministers on Thursday held Iraq
responsible for the consequences of refusing to cooperate with U.N.
weapons inspectors.
	   They also urged that ``wisdom and reason prevail'' in the
conflict, but did not mention any nation involved.
	   But diplomats attending a conference in Doha, Qatar, said the
message was directed to both Iraq and the United States.
	   ``The Iraqi government is held responsible for any consequences
that might arise from its refusal to back down from its decision to
expel the U.N. weapons inspectors which will expose the innocent
Iraqi people to more miseries and tragedies,'' said the final
communique of the meeting of the ministers from eight Arab
countries.
	   The foreign ministers of Egypt, Syria and six Gulf states called
on Iraq to fully cooperate with the weapons inspectors according to
U.N. resolutions.
	   The statement expressed hope that ``wisdom and reason prevail so
that the United Nations can reach a diplomatic solution to the
crisis.''
	   The statement appeared to be a warning to Iraq that it should
not count on Arab support in its dispute with the United Nations.
	   The United States and Britain have threatened military strikes
if Baghdad does not rescind its refusal to cooperate with the arms
inspectors.
	   All of the 90 U.N. weapons inspectors left Iraq Wednesday as the
possibility of a strike increased. Many U.N. relief workers have
also been evacuated.
	   U.S. State Department spokesman James P. Rubin said the
statement of the Arab foreign ministers in Doha ``reflects the
growing and near unanimity, especially in the Arab world, that Iraq
is responsible solely for the consequences.''
	   The U.N. resolutions say that international sanctions against
Iraq will not be lifted until weapons inspectors dismantle Iraqi
programs to build weapons of mass destruction and set up a
monitoring system to ensure that such programs cannot be restarted.
The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   During the two-day conference, the Arab foreign ministers also
discussed the Middle East peace accord and the Syrian-Turkish
agreement over Kurdish separatists.
	   The two-day conference is the first meeting of the so-called
Damascus-8 since July 1997. The group normally meets twice a year,
but it canceled a meeting last December after a row between Egypt
and Qatar.
	   By the Damascus Declaration of 1991, Egypt and Syria pledged to
defend the security of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the United
Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia, and Gulf states promised to give
aid to the Cairo and Damascus governments.

Chirac, Jospin down in polls
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Conservative President Jacques Chirac and Socialist
Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, while not always on the same
wavelength, are sharing one thing: plummeting popularity rates.
	   Two opinion polls published Thursday show both Chirac and Jospin
are continuing to suffer from high unemployment, student discontent
and sporadic strikes.
	   Jospin, whose ratings have at times topped 70 percent since he
took office in June last year, got a 63 percent approval rating,
down 11 points, according to a Louis Harris poll.
	   Chirac got a 60 percent rating in the same poll, also down 11
points from last month.
	   Another survey, conducted by the IPSOS agency for Le Point
magazine, showed Chirac getting a 63 percent rating, down three
points and Jospin sliding five points to a 60 percent approval
rating.
	   Both leaders had profited from France's summer World Cup soccer
victory and from economic growth. But the French stock market has
suffered from the world financial crisis and unemployment, while
down slightly, remains at a hefty 11.7 percent.
	   Both polls were conducted Nov. 6-7, surveying a nationally
representative sampling of 1,004 adults for the Louis Harris poll
and 940 adults in the IPSOS sampling. No margins of error were
given, but such French polls usually carry an error margin of plus
or minus 2-3 percent.

Yeltsin cancels dinner with Japanes PM

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with Yeltsin cancelling dinner. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin canceled a dinner with Japanese
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday, though the Kremlin
insisted it had nothing to do with the Russian president's health
and said he was feeling fine.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov attended the dinner in Yeltsin's
place, according to an agreement worked out with the Japanese
delegation earlier Thursday, a Kremlin spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
	   The spokesman said the cancellation was not connected to
Yeltsin's health and said he was feeling OK.
	   Yeltsin had been on vacation to recover from what aides
described as fatigue and high blood pressure. The ailments, coming
on top of a respiratory infection a month ago, have led to renewed
speculations about his ability to govern.
	   Earlier Thursday, Yeltsin's wife said he feels well after a
weeklong vacation at a Black Sea resort, but is having trouble
adjusting to Moscow's freezing weather.
	   After a relatively warm October, temperatures in Moscow have
dropped to record lows for this time of year, reaching -19 degrees
C (-2 F) at night, since Yeltsin returned from the Sochi resort on
Sunday.
	   Yeltsin met with visiting Obuchi earlier Thursday, while
Yeltsin's wife Naina spent the day touring Moscow with Obuchi's
wife Tizuko.
	   The Russian president is feeling well, ``only the
acclimatization is proceeding rather difficultly,'' Naina Yeltsin
told Mrs. Obuchi, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``I think he will no longer feel (the climate change) in a few
days,'' Mrs. Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   She would not say whether Yeltsin planned to resume his vacation
after Obuchi leaves Moscow.
	   ``We have not talked about that,'' Mrs. Yeltsin said.
	   The 67-year-old Russian leader has suffered from a range of
health troubles in the past, including a quintuple heart bypass
surgery two years ago. But he insists he has no major health
problems and intends to serve out his term, which runs until
mid-2000.

Report: First direct contact this government-ETA
</HEADLINE>

had contacts with ETA; ADDS new final graf with background. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and the Basque militant group ETA have made direct
contact for the first time, taking a step toward new peace talks, a
newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The communication was limited to a recognition that the
government and ETA would have future contacts, the daily El Mundo
reported, quoting unnamed government sources.
	   Aznar last week authorized contacts with ETA, and promised to
inform the public of all developments related to the Basque peace
process
	   But Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office refused to
comment, saying that the delicacy of the issue requires discretion.
	   The latest possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year
violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling the
Spanish-French border dates to Sept. 18 when ETA announced an
indefinite cease-fire.
	   Spain's government gradually softened its position on the truce,
with initial skepticism turning into a promise of dialogue. The
government insists, however, that the agenda will not include the
subject of Basque independence.
	   The government says it is willing to talk about the fate of
ETA's 535 prisoners in return for a clear commitment to give up
violence forever.
	   ETA, a Basque language acronym for Basque Homeland and Freedom _
has killed nearly 800 people since taking up arms in 1968.
	   The government last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when
the Socialist government of Felipe Gonzalez was in office. The
talks broke down and the violence resumed.

Another seed is knocked out as Pioline loses to Nestor

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Canadian Daniel Nestor reduced the
number of seeds in the Stockholm Open to only three Thursday,
ousting No. 4 Cedric Pioline of France in three sets.
	   Nestor, ranked only 115th on the ATP Tour computer, beat the
sixth-seeded Frenchman 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 to reach the quarterfinals.
	   Nestor's victory came less than 24 hours after Jason Stoltenberg
upset top-ranked Pete Sampras in a first-rund match. Other seeded
players who have lost include Slovakia's Karol Kucera (2),
defending champion Jonas Bjorkman (5) of Sweden and former two-time
Stockholm Open winner Thomas Enqvist (8), also of Sweden.
	   Pioline, a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon finalist who is 16th
on the ATP Tour list, failed to take advantage of five break points
when tied at 2-2 in the decisive set.
	   Nestor finally held, firing an ace past Pioline and then hitting
another good first serve that the Frenchman couldn't return.
	   Both players then held their serves, but Pioline fell behind
15-40 in the eighth game. Pioline saved the first break point. But
Nestor capitalized on a lucky net cord on the second, Pioline's
return sailing long.
	   Nestor, who was only broken once in the match, then closed out
the set.
	   In the quarters, Nestor will play the winner between fourth-seed
Greg Rusedski of Britain and Vince Spadea of the United States, who
met in Thursday's second centercourt match in the Royal Tennis
Hall.
	   In other second-round matches, Jason Stoltenberg of Australia
played Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany and American qualifier Geoff
Grant faced Thomas Johansson of Sweden.

Berlusconi testifies at Spanish court in tax fraud case

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio
Berlusconi testified Thursday before at a court here in a probe
into a suspected tax fraud at a Spanish television network.
	   ``There exists a colossal misunderstanding'', Berlusconi told
reporters before starting a five-hour questioning session before
National Court Judge Baltasar Garzon, the state-run news agency EFE
reported. He left the court later Thursday.
	   The Italian politician and media magnate already testified July
24 and had asked the magistrate to postpone another questioning
session to allow him time to study the case.
	   Garzon is investigating the suspected 5 billion pesetas (dlrs 33
million) tax fraud at one of Spain's private channels, Telecinco,
in which Berlusconi's company Fininvest had 25 percent of the
stakes.
	   In July, Berlusconi was given a two years and nine month prison
term in Italy for bribing tax inspectors to obtain favorable audits
of Fininvest company.

Norway's government struggles to find support for national budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Christian Democrat-led minority
government remained politically isolated Thursday when the leftist
Labor Party refused to support the proposed national budget for
next year.
	   The right-of-center parties also refuse, causing a political
stalemate that, in the worst case scenario, might force a change of
the government led by Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik.
	   The year-old coalition of Christian Democrats, the Center Party,
and the Liberals has just 42 seats in the 165-member parliament,
and requires support from opposition parties to pass its 1999
national budget by mid-December.
	   Labor Party leader Thorbjoern Jagland, who stepped down as prime
minister a year ago when his party suffered an election setback,
said it quickly became obvious Thursday that his party and the
coalition were deadlocked over the budget.
	   ``We knew it was going to be difficult, but we wanted to try,''
said Einar Steenaes, parliamentary leader of the Christian
Democrats, said after the break with Labor.
	   Labor, with 62 seats in parliament, has refused to back the
budget because it includes increases in a paid parenting program,
in which parents receive cash support to stay home and care for
their very small children.
	   ``From the government's side, there was no will to discuss the
cash support,'' said Jagland.
	   Talks on a budget compromise between the government and two
right-wing parties, the Conservatives and the Party of Progress,
broke off Wednesday over proposed tax hikes. The political right
refused to accept any tax increases.
	   Steenaes told the Norwegian news agency NTB that the budget
would be sent back to parliament's finance committee for further
negotiations, and that the government would modify the budget to
reflect political signals from previous negotiations.
	   The government could attempt to force the budget through
parliament by calling a vote of confidence in the hope that
political right, which does not want Labor to return to power,
would give in and accept the proposal.
	   Steenaes said he hoped to win support for the budget during
parliament's Nov. 25 and 26 finance debate in which the government
``will position itself to have the best chance of getting a
majority.''

	   NEW DELHI, India (AP) _ For the second time in five months,
India on Thursday tested a sea-skimming missile that can deliver
conventional explosives up to a range of nine kilometers (5.5
miles), domestic news agencies said.
	   The Indian-made Trishul missile was fired from a naval base in
the southwestern city of Cochin, Press Trust of India news agency
reported.
	   ``Analysis of the test firing was very encouraging,'' the news
agency quoted project director A.J. Kapoor as saying.
	   The 650-kilo (1,444-pound) missile can also be used as a
surface-to-air missile with a range of 25 kilometers (15 miles).
	   The government plans to make Trishul, or Trident, part of the
navy armory by the end of the decade.
	   The naval version uses solid fuel, has a range of up to nine
kilometers (5.5 miles), and can carry a warhead of 15 kilos (33
pounds). This sea-skimming version was first tested in June, and
two more tests are planned in the next few days, United News of
India news agency reported.
	   ``The current tests prove that the missile is among the best ...
of similar types,'' said Sivathanu Pillai, chief controller of the
Defense Research and Development Organization, which developed the
missile.
	   The latest test came as India and Pakistan resumed talks to
reduce tension between the two nations, which have fought three
wars over the Himalayan territory of Kashmir. Little progress has
been made in talks held so far.
	   India tested five underground nuclear devices in May and is
perfecting a delivery system. India says it needs a nuclear defense
against China and Pakistan, both nuclear powers.

Pro-British group's cease-fire genuine, government decides
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By SHAWN POGATCHNIK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ The cease-fire being observed
by Northern Ireland's most ruthless pro-British paramilitary group
is genuine and should be rewarded, the British government announced
Thursday.
	   Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam's decision marked a
dramatic turnaround in fortunes for the Loyalist Volunteer Force,
which began slaying Catholics at random three years ago in hopes of
derailing Northern Ireland's peace process.
	   It could pave the way for the group's approximately 30
imprisoned members to be freed early under terms of April's peace
accord.
	   More than 200 prisoners from the Irish Republican Army and the
two biggest pro-British armed groups, the Ulster Defense
Association and Ulster Volunteer Force, already have been freed in
recognition of their cease-fires.
	   But when the Loyalist Volunteers called a cease-fire in May _
one week before voters in both parts of Ireland ratified the peace
agreement _ most observers dismissed it as temporary.
	   Since then, however, the group has appointed an emissary to deal
with an international commission seeking the gradual disarmament of
Northern Ireland's myriad underground armies.
	   Unlike other armed groups that have observed much longer truces,
the Loyalist Volunteers have offered to hand in some weaponry if
the British government recognized their truce.
	   ``I am now satisfied that they have established a complete and
unequivocal cease-fire, and over a significant period of time ...
they have demonstrated that that cease-fire is being maintained,''
Mowlam said in a statement.
	   The IRA, which killed more than 1,800 people in hopes of
abolishing Northern Ireland as a Protestant-majority state, has
observed a truce since July 1997. And the UDA and UVF, responsible
for slaying 900 mostly Catholic civilians, have observed truces
since October 1994.
	   Alex Maskey of the IRA-allied Sinn Fein party criticized
Mowlam's decision, calling the Loyalist Volunteers' truce a ploy
designed to put pressure on the IRA to disarm, something the IRA
refuses to do.
	   Mowlam decided not to recognize as genuine two cease-fires being
observed by anti-British rivals of the IRA _ the Irish National
Liberation Army and the so-called Real IRA, which was responsible
for an August car bombing in the Northern Ireland town of Omagh
that killed 29 people and injured more than 330 but since has
called a truce.

	   BEIT EL, West Bank _ Rahamim Karo walked along the wire fence
outside his stone house Thursday and motioned toward the
Palestinian village just 100 yards away.
	   It's so close that on most mornings, Karo wakes up to the sound
of Palestinian school children singing their national anthem,
``Biladi, biladi.''
	   For now, the Israeli army is still in charge in the area. But
once Israel withdraws from West Bank land as part of the new peace
agreement, Palestinian police will deploy in the village and the
prospect is spooking many of Beit El's 5,000 residents.
	   One day after the Israeli Cabinet approved the latest peace
accord, the pulse of the settlers the day was a blend of
apprehension, defiance and defeat.
	   ``People feel this is another wave of adversity that we have to
make it through but we are probably not aware of just how big this
next wave will be,'' said Karo, 33, a janitor at a Beit El
elementary school.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and ruled over the lives of its Palestinian population until
the 1993 peace process began. Some 150,000 Israeli settlers and 1.6
million Arabs live on the land now which Palestinians want for a
future state.
	   When Israeli troops begin withdrawing from areas next week,
Palestinians there will gain more freedom of movement, will not be
subject to Israeli searches and troops will no longer be able to
enter their villages.
	   Karo and others including Helen Borer, a Manhattan native who
moved to Beit El 21 years ago and lives there today with her eight
children, said they fear a reduced Israeli troop presence will lead
to everything from drive-by shootings, ambushes, car stonings and
attacks on their property.
	   Borer said despite her concerns for the future, she will not
leave the settlement. And she dismissed defense ministry plans to
furbish the community with anti-tank ditches and video surveillance
systems.
	   ``You can't fight a battle by erecting another wall, another
moat. We are not living in the Middle Ages,'' Borer said, standing
in the rose garden of Beit El's Jewish seminary where she works as
a secretary.
	   A survey conducted by Modaein Ezrahi, an Israeli polling firm,
found that 41 percent of settlers oppose the Wye Accords. The poll,
which had a margin of error of 5 percent surveyed 419 adults living
in settlements all over the West Bank.
	   Rivka, a 36-year-old nurse who wore a traditional black head
scarf and like most religious Jewish women asked that her last name
not be used, said she came to Beit El as an idealistic teenager.
	   Today, however, she is less confidant of her mission.
	   ``I want to live in a Jewish state, not a Palestinian state,''
she said, ``I felt like I was serving Israel and now I feel like I
am a soldier left alone in the field.''

Show of solidarity may not be enough to rebuild Central America

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Celebrities are arriving and
governments are promising millions of dollars, but it's far from
clear whether the show of solidarity will be enough to rebuild
Central America after Hurricane Mitch.
	   The storm that killed 10,000 people has set back the region's
development by years, and many Central Americans say they have seen
little sign of the promised foreign aid.
	   A U.N. agency announced Thursday it was boosting deliveries of
food aid to Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, which
were devastated by mudslides and floods. The Rome-based World Food
Program said it would distribute more than 100,000 tons of rice,
corn, fish and oil over the next six months.
	   ``With emergency assistance, these people are at extreme
nutritional risk _ in addition to facing the threat of cholera and
other diseases from unsanitary conditions throughout the region,''
said Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive director.
	   As well as the United Nations, governments around the world have
promised hundreds of millions of dollars in relief.
	   In a radio address Wednesday, Honduran President Carlos Flores
Facusse urged the United States to join other nations in forgiving
Honduras' dlrs 4.3 billion debt and in backing new funds to create
``a massive supply of fresh resources to aid in rebuilding the
country.''
	   Honduras has little direct U.S. debt, but the United States
plays an important role in international organizations to which
Honduras owes money.
	   With so much of Central America in ruins, the aid announced so
far is likely to fall well short of the need. In Honduras alone,
the Inter-American Development Bank has estimated that up to 90
percent of the country's roads and other infrastructure were
destroyed.

 &UR; More French flavor for English soccer with Houllier at Liverpool

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ If this keeps up, French could become
the official language of English soccer.
	   The Premier League took on additional French flavor Thursday
when Gerard Houllier assumed control of Liverpool after the
departure of co-manager Roy Evans.
	   Houllier, the former French national coach, becomes the second
Frenchman as sole manager of a Premiership club. The other is
Arsene Wenger, who guided Arsenal to the league and F.A. Cup double
last season.
	   ``I am not here simply to wear a suit,'' Houllier said Thursday.
``I will be very much involved in the team on the field. I will be
in sole charge because that is the only way it works.''
	   Six of England's highest profiles clubs are now managed by
non-Englishmen _ Manchester United (Alex Ferguson, Scotland),
Arsenal (Wenger), Liverpool (Houllier), Tottenham (George Graham,
Scotland), Newcastle (Ruud Gullit, Netherlands) and Chelsea
(Gianluca Vialli, Italy).
	   The league is full of non-British players from around the world.
French players are in abundance, including Emmanuel Petit, Patrick
Vieira and Nicolas Anelka at Arsenal, Frank Leboeuf and Marcel
Dessaily at Chelsea, and David Ginola at Tottenham.
	   Houllier, 51, worked early in his career as an English teacher
and, like Wenger, had only modest success as a player, never
playing professionally.
	   His most successful periods as manager were at Lens (1982-85),
where he won promotion and qualified for the UEFA Cup, and then at
Paris Saint-Germain (1985-88), where he won the French championship
in 1986.
	   Houllier left PSG to become technical director of the French
Football Federation.
	   He took over as the French national team coach in 1992 from
Michel Platini, but stepped down in 1993 when France failed to
qualify for the 1994 World Cup in the United States.
	   France looked ready to make it to the United States, but lost
its last two matches, both at home, to Israel and Bulgaria.
Houllier's record as French manager: seven wins, one draw and four
defeats.
	   Houllier, who returned to his post as technical director after
the World Cup failure, joined Liverpool this summer as co-manager
with Evans. The arrangement has foundered, leaving one of England's
most storied clubs in 11th place.
	   ``Maybe at one stage they (players) didn't know who was the boss
_ who they had to refer to,'' Houllier said.
	   Liverpool was ousted Tuesday from the League Cup 3-1 by
Tottenham _ probably the Reds' worst game all season. It came on
the heels of a 2-1 league loss to a modest Derby side.
	   Houllier inherits a club with half a dozen world-class players.
But most of the talent is up front, with the defense the worst in
recent memory with supporters calling for an experienced central
defender.
	   Houllier's first match in control is Saturday at Anfield agaisnt
Leeds. He will be without England midfielder Steve McManaman
(achilles injury) and fellow England star Michael Owen, who
suffered a hamstring injury in the Tottenham loss.
	   McManaman's contract ends at the end of the season, with reports
he could be headed to Spain. Houllier is also reported to have
doubts about keeping mercurial England midfielder Paul Ince, who
seems to be embroiled in one red-card suspension after another.

Russians still rule skating

 &UR; By SALVATORE ZANCA &QC;

<TEXT>
	   GELSENKIRCHEN, Germany (AP) - After two meets in North America,
the figure skating Grand Prix Series returns to Europe with
Russians looking to continue their domination of the lucrative
competitions with world champion Alexei Yagudin leading the way.
	   The Nations Cup which begins Friday is the third in the
International Skating Union's that features Olympic-eligible
skaters.
	   The first two events, Skate America and Skate Canada, had four
Russian victories in the eight events.
	   Yagudin was the men's singles winner in Skate America. With a
new coach and a new presence on the ice, he looks to dominate this
season with three-time world champion Elvis Stojko still slow in
coming back from the groin injury.
	   Olympic champion Ilia Kulik of Russia is taking the year off
from these kind of international competitions to earn money in
shows and pro-am events.
	   Still the Russians are deep. Alexei Urmanov, the 1994 Olympic
champion, is back skating but his place on the Russian world team
is not secure. Yevgeny Plushenko won Skate Canada.
	   Alexander Abt of Russia was third at the European championships
but could not gain a spot at the worlds or Olympics. He is
competing in the Nations Cup and could challenge Yagudin.
	   Yagudin, however, has shifted coaches from last year and is now
with Tatiana Tarasova, who guided Kulik to the Olympic gold medal.
	   Tarasova knows how to bring out the best in skaters. In her
32-year career, her students have collected 33 gold medals, seven
in the Olympics and the rest in World and European championships.
	   She worked with Yagudin in New Jersey, where she transferred
from Marlborough, Massachusetts.
	   ``After a few practice sessions I saw he had a great talent as
an actor,'' Tarasoava said. ``So I made a short program to bring
out those talents.''
	   Yagudin's short program, to be skated on Friday, has a circus
theme with him showing juggling and other circus acts.
	   Yagudin was tight-lipped about the forces that move him away
from his long-time coach, Alexei Mishin, who also coaches Urmanov
and Plushenko.
	   ``Let's just say I'm old enough to put myself in my own hands,''
said Yagudin, who turned 18 in March, just a few days after winning
his world title in Minneapolis.
	   In the women's competition another Russian, Maria Butyrskaya, is
also looking for for her second victory after winning Skate
America.
	   Yet another Russian, Yelena Sokolova, finished second at Skate
America and could challenge for the victory after many feel she had
the better free skate in Detroit, Michigan.
	   Sokolova, 18, is one of a half-dozen Russian skaters, all with
medals from world junior and senior championships, who could fight
for spots for the Russian team.
	   With Olympic champion Tara Lipinski leaving the eligible ranks
and world champion Michelle Kwan taking the year off from these
competiitons, a place on the Russian team should mean a medal.
Butyskaya was third at the world last year behind Kwan and two-time
European champion Irina Slutskaya.
	   Russian World champions Angelika Krylova and Oleg Ovsiannikov
make their season's debut in the ice dance competition. Krylova and
Ovsiannikov moved to the top after two-time Olympic champions Pasha
Grishuk and Yevgeny Platov stopped competing and eventually split
up.
	   Krylova said they are not taking it easy, even though they are
the world champions.
	   ``Each season we start from level zero,'' Krylova said. ``And we
have to work very hard for every competition.''
	   Canadians Shae-Lynn Bournes and Victor Kraatz, fresh from a
victory at Skate Canada where the top Russians didn't compete, are
present in Germany to challenge Krylova and Ovsiannikov.
	   The pairs field is weak here with Germany veterans Peggy Schwarz
and Mirko Mueller the top-couple.
	   Winners of the events receive dlrs 30,000. The next event is the
Lalique Trophy in Paris next week.
	   The series culminates with the March final in Russia, two weeks
before the world championships in Finland.

Report: First direct contact this government-ETA
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: EDITS to clarify that previous Spanish government had contacts
with ETA; ADDS new final graf with background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ The Spanish government of Prime Minister
Jose Maria Aznar and the armed Basque separatist group ETA have
made direct contact for the first time, an initial step toward new
peace talks, a newspaper reported Thursday.
	   The move followed Aznar's authorization last week of contacts
with ETA, the daily El Mundo reported, quoting unnamed government
sources.
	   Francisco Martos, a spokesman for Aznar's office contacted by
The Associated Press, refused to comment on the report. He said
that although Aznar has promised to inform the public of all
developments related to the Basque peace process, the delicacy of
the issue requires that the details be treated with discretion.
	   El Mundo said the first direct contacts between this government
and ETA were limited to a recognition that there would be more
contact in the future.
	   The latest possibility of a negotiated end to ETA's 30-year-long
violent campaign for an independent Basque homeland straddling the
Spanish-French border dates to Sept. 18 when ETA began observing an
indefinite cease-fire.
	   The government gradually softened its position on the truce,
with the initial suspicion developing into a promise of dialogue.
	   Although willing to talk, the government insists that the agenda
will not include political issues such as ETA's stated aim of
Basque independence.
	   The government says it is willing to talk about the fate of
ETA's 535 prisoners in return for a clear commitment to give up
violence forever and respect existing democratic procedures.
	   ETA--the initials in the Basque language stand for Basque
Homeland and Freedom--has killed nearly 800 people since taking up
arms in 1968.
	   The government last held talks with ETA in 1989 in Algeria when
Felipe Gonzalez's Socialist party was in office. The talks broke
down and the violence resumed.

Vatican sponsors filmfest to promote link with faith
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Vatican is helping to sponsor a film festival to
promote links between popular culture and faith.
	   Among the 21 films to be show for free at two Rome cinemas Nov.
17 through Dec. 8. are ``Winter Guest,'' which explores
generational conflict, ``Life is Beautiful,'' the Italian work
which just opened in the United States and which uses humor to
recount the horror of the Holocaust and Steven Spielberg's
``Amistad,'' which deals with slavery.
	   Watching the films should deepen ``the dialogue between faith
and culture,'' Cardinal Paul Poupard said when presenting the
festival.
	   The cardinal added that said Pope John Paul II believes cinema
is ``able to create moments of a extraordinary intensity.''
	   Italy's state film promotion agency is the other big sponsor of
the second edition of the ``International Festival of Spiritual
Cinema.''

France requests Pinochet's extradition

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with background on one of the ``disappeared,'' ADDS
background on Switzerland; and other Chilean exiles seeking
Pinochet's extradition

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities on Thursday officially asked
Britain to extradite former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet so he
can face charges related to the disappearance of French citizens.
	   A Justice Ministry statement said the extradition request was
sent to British authorities via the French Foreign Ministry.
	   A French court sent a temporary arrest warrant for Pinochet to
British authorities on Nov. 3, accusing him of ``sequestration
followed by torture.''
	   It was the final step necessary before France could officially
ask for extradition.
	   Three French families have filed complaints against Pinochet in
France.
	   The relative of one of them, Etienne Pesle, disappeared after
military officials arrested him in his office in September 1973. He
had lived for several years in Chile with his Chilean wife and
three children.
	   The last report of Pesle seen alive was by a Chilean soldier,
who said he saw Pesle soon after being driven out of a military
camp, his hands tied behind his back.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish extradition
warrant citing charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping during
his 17-year rule, which began in 1973 when he toppled Salvador
Allende.
	   Switzerland also has requested Pinochet's arrest and extradition
on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. And Chilean exiles in
Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Germany have filed criminal complaints
they hope will lead to extradition requests.
	   In Britain Thursday, prosecutors wrapped up their appeal of a
court ruling allowing Pinochet immunity from prosecution there,
arguing that the crimes against humanity he is charged with
``unequivocally'' violate international law.
	   A report by Chile's government says about 3,000 people were
killed or disappeared at the hands of secret police under Pinochet.
	   Chile has protested his arrest, saying it strains the country's
democracy.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ German Finance Minister Oskar Lafontaine
denied media reports Thursday that he was a candidate to succeed
Jacques Santer as the European Commission president.
	   A Social Democratic European parliamentarian, Klaus Haensch,
told Saarlaendischer Rundfunk radio that he is promoting Lafontaine
as a candidate for the post. ``It's Germany's turn to occupy this
post,'' Haensch said. A German last held the commission presidency
from 1958-67.
	   Germany already has sought French support for a German
candidate, the weekly Die Zeit reported in its latest edition,
published Thursday.
	   But Lafontaine issued a statement rejecting ``rumors and
speculation'' that he planned to take the Brussels job as
``nonsense.''
	   In Brussels, European Commission spokeswoman Martine Reichert
declined to comment on the report that Lafontaine would succeed
Santer, whose five-year term expires at the end of 1999.
	   Under EU rules, the commission president is selected by the 15
EU governments, each of which has the right to put forward a
candidate, and their choice must be ratified by the European
Parliament.
	   Lafontaine already has substantial influence in the new Social
Democratic-led German government, occupying both the party's top
post and running the Finance Ministry as Germany joins 10 other
European countries in the monetary union launching Jan. 1.

Lithuanian court sets trial date for suspected Nazi war criminal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VILNIUS, Lithuania (AP) _ A 90-year-old suspected Nazi war
criminal will be brought to trial in January on charges of sending
scores of Jews to their deaths when he was a top police officer
during World War, a Lithuanian court ruled Thursday.
	   Kazys Gimzauskas, a former U.S. citizen, was deputy chief of the
Vilnius security police during the 1940-41 Nazi occupation of this
small Baltic nation. He has been charged with genocide for
participating in the near extermination of Lithuania's Jewish
community, and has denied any wrongdoing.
	   The Vilnius District Court on Thursday set a trial date of Jan.
5 for Gimzauskas, who was stripped of his U.S. citizenship for
hiding his Nazi past and fled to Lithuania from St. Petersburg,
Florida in 1993.
	   Gimzauskas is the second Lithuania involved in a major Nazi war
crimes trial since Lithuanian gained independence from the Soviet
Union in 1991.
	   His superior in the Nazi-run security police, Aleksandras
Lileikis, 91, was brought to trial on similar charges this month,
but was rushed away in an ambulance just as the case was opening.
	   Both men claim to be too ill to face trial. A law recently
passed in Lithuania allows the indictment, but not trial, of war
crimes in absentia.
	   In the Gimzauskas case, prosecutors are expected to focus on
five Lithuanian Jews they believe they can prove Gimzauskas turned
over for execution. More than 90 percent of Lithuania's prewar
Jewish community of 240,000 died during the war.
	   Some Jewish groups accuse Lithuania of delaying trials of Nazi
war criminals to avoid confronting the nation's past under German
occupation.

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ With talks on Mexican-European free trade
beginning, French President Jacques Chirac on Thursday began an
official visit to Mexico that officials said would improve economic
ties between the two countries.
	   Chirac, his wife Bernadette and a delegation of 50 officials and
businessmen arrived around midnight on the first step of a trip
that will also take him to the hurricane-devastated countries of
Central America.
	   The disaster of Hurricane Mitch, which killed nearly 10,000
people in Honduras and Nicaragua, almost overshadowed the long-term
issues of Franco-Mexican relations.
	   ``I want to express the profound emotion that France feels at
the tragedy inflicted by Hurricane Mitch on Mexico's neighbor
countries,'' Chirac said at the welcoming ceremony at Mexico City's
military parade ground, the Campo Marte.
	   Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo in turn said Mexico was
``moved by France's decision to come to the help of our Central
American brothers'' with aid and relief of debts for those
countries.
	   Chirac was to address Mexico's Congress later in the day.
	   ``It is a very special moment in relation between Mexico and
France,'' Mexican Foreign Secretary Rosario Green said this week,
noting that France has promoted a European Union free trade
agreement with Mexico.
	   ``France wants to be your privileged interlocutor within the
European Union,'' Chirac said at the welcoming ceremony, adding
that it would push to complete the free trade pact.

Ukraine's government desperate to avoid fiscal crunch
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By VIKTOR LUHOVYK &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KIEV, Ukraine (AP) _ Ukraine's government is working on a
schedule of daily budgetary receipts and expenditures until the end
of the year to try to keep the fragile currency market stable, the
central bank chief said Thursday.
	   If the government manages to correctly foresee its revenues and
expenditures in November and December, the hryvna currency will
remain stable, National Bank chief Viktor Yushchenko said.
	   ``The government has a chance to to effectively control the
situation until the end of the year,'' Yushchenko said, according
to the Interfax news agency.
	   Ukraine has suffered badly from the economic crisis in
neighboring Russia, but recently has managed to stabilize the
hryvna and prevent steep price rises, largely by controlling
government spending.
	   Yushchenko said the National Bank's foreign currency reserves,
currently at about dlrs 1 billion, have risen by more than 12
percent over the past month, a signal that the hryvna ``is in an
absolutely stable position.''
	   However, the hryvna's further stability will depend on how the
Cabinet raises revenues and controls its spending in the coming
months, Yushchenko said.
	   The Ukrainian government has chronically failed to collect
taxes, which companies avoid because they say the rates are too
high, and was slow to implement reforms needed to boost budget
revenues.
	   Enterprises' debt to the government skyrocketed this year to
more than 11 billion hryvna (dlrs 3.2 billion). In order to stay
afloat, the government has put off 6 billion hryvna (1.8 billion)
in social welfare payments.
	   Financier George Soros, currently on a visit to Ukraine, said
Thursday that balancing the budget was the government's most
serious problem. Without that, he said, Ukraine can hardly hope for
rapid economic development and return of foreign investors.
	   In a new attempt to raise badly needed cash, the Cabinet on
Thursday introduced several dozen measures intended to encourage
tax payments, boost banking activity, and make exporters return to
Ukraine the earnings they hid abroad to avoid taxes.
	   Tax authorities were also ordered to take additional steps to
extract money from debtor companies, Finance Minister Ihor Mitiukov
said.
	   He said the government needs the money urgently to pay off its
mounting foreign debt, now at dlrs 10.9 billion.
	   The government also needs more revenues to keep the 1998 budget
deficit at 2.5 percent, a key condition of the International
Monetary Fund for disbursing a recently approved dlrs 2.2 billion
loan to Ukraine.
	   An IMF mission left Kiev last week unsatisfied with how the
government has tackled tax collection and payment of wage debts,
and urged it to introduce more reforms to qualify for the next
tranche of the loan.

Swissair buys into Germany's LTU
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ SAirGroup AG, parent of Swissair and
other carriers, advanced its goal of forging a European holiday
flight group Thursday by acquiring a 49.9 percent stake in
Germany's LTU Group.
	   SAirGroup declined to reveal the value of the stake, but German
media have placed it at about 2 billion marks (dlrs 1.25 billion).
German investors own the remaining stake.
	   SAirGroup said it will finance the transaction with its own cash
flow and proceeds from the prior sale of four hotels in the United
States.
	   LTU, with total annual sales of close to 5 billion marks (dlrs
3.1 billion), ran a minuscule operating profit last year.
	   But SAirGroup had its sights on LTU's 29 aircraft and its 2
billion marks (dlrs 1.25 billion) in annual leisure flight
revenues, to complement its own small charter operations and those
of its allies. SAirGroup itself has 133 aircraft.
	   LTU flies 7.2 million vacationers a year, while Swissair alone
flies 11.1 million passengers.
	   SAirGroup made clear that it plans to eventually unload LTU's
tour operator business, which has annual revenues of around 2.75
billion marks (dlrs 1.7 billion) and little profit.
	   The real value of the LTU transaction lies in the fact that
SAirGroup obtains a large share of the big German leisure flight
market and fills out its charter operations and links in Europe.
	   After merger talks among Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines,
Austrian Airlines and Scandinavian Airline Systems collapsed in
1993, SAirGroup embarked on an alternative global strategy in
forging alliances with carriers around the world.
	   In Europe, these allies include Sabena, Austrian Airlines and
other, smaller carriers. SAirGroup has minority equity stakes in
several of them.
	   The company also has other alliances, including with Delta Air
Lines Inc. of the United States, Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong
Kong, South African Airways, Qantas of Australia, and Malaysia
Airlines.
	   AS SAirGroup Chairman Hannes Goetz told a press conference, the
agreement with LTU opens up new markets for both companies, brings
synergies from a combined network, and harmonizes their fleets,
catering and technology.
	   He said Switzerland's absence from the European Union ``made it
necessary to work with partners'' in order to assure the company's
access to the vast European Union market, where rules require
outsiders to remain minority shareholders.
	   With SAirGroup's 10-member alliance of scheduled airlines
already in place, dubbed ``Qualiflyer Group,'' Goetz said, ``We've
now shifted our attention to the charter and leisure travel
business, where we hope to create a similar European grouping.''
	   SAirGroup chief executive officer Philippe Bruggisser added that
LTU will keep its own identity. But he said ``the period of
consolidation has begun in the airline business.''
	   He said ``correct'' strategies will elicit advantageous
synergies. ``A European leisure travel grouping doesn't mean
cutbacks,'' he said. ``It means growth and expansion.''
	   One area SAirGroup will seek to improve is LTU's meager 2
percent flight operating profit margin. SAirGroup's flight
operations have a 4 percent margin.

Newspaper wins dispute over publication of new diary pages
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Name Germ in 9th graf is cq. &QL; 
 &UR; By JENIFER CHAO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ A Dutch newspaper was vindicated
Thursday for publishing three recently discovered pages of Anne
Frank's classic diary after a court said a printed apology was
unnecessary.
	   The lawsuit was brought by the Basel, Switzerland-based Anne
Frank Fund, which holds the copyright to the best-selling ``Diary
of Anne Frank'' by the young Jewish girl who hid with her family
from the Nazis.
	   It claimed that Het Parool, an Amsterdam daily, published the
pages without its consent and had acted illegally. The group wanted
Het Parool to print a front-page rectification and to stop quoting
from the new pages or sending copies to other media.
	   But in a written decision, an Amsterdam District Court judge
rejected that request and ordered the Swiss organization to pay the
newspaper's court costs.
	   ``The decision is good for the freedom of the press,'' said
Willem van Manen, a lawyer for the newspaper.
	   The diary pages appeared on the front page of Het Parool on Aug.
26, and later on its Internet site. The newspaper ran them days
after a Dutch scholar's startling announcement that he had five
previously unknown handwritten pages he said Anne's father gave him
shortly before his death in 1980.
	   Het Parool contended it adhered to copyright rules because the
pages ordinarily would have been published along with the rest of
the famed diary if Otto Frank hadn't kept them separate from the
rest of the manuscript.
	   Their sheer newsworthiness also justified the publication, the
paper argued.
	   Germ Kemper, a lawyer for the Anne Frank Fund, said the court
has clearly put news reporting before the interests of copyright
holders. ``Copyright holders need to be protected from unauthorized
publications,'' he said.
	   The diary controversy began in August, when longtime Frank
family friend Cor Suijk revealed the existence of the pages, in
which Anne criticized her parents' marriage.
	   Anne and her family fled Nazi Germany before World War II and
hid in a secret annex in an Amsterdam canal house from July 1942
until they were betrayed in August 1944.
	   Aspiring to be a writer, Anne chronicled their cramped existence
in her diary, which was published posthumously. It has been
translated from Dutch into more than 50 languages and has sold
millions of copies worldwide.
	   Anne died in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp in March 1945,
just three months before her 16th birthday.

	   ROME (AP) _ Olivetti will have a stake of more than 20 percent
of Mannesmann euro.map, according to the head of Infostrada, which
is owned by a joint venture between Olivetti and Mannesmann AG.
	   Marco De Benedetti, chairman of Infostrada, a fixed-line
telecommuncations company, said Thursday that euro.map, a new
company started by Mannesmann for international telecommunications
traffic, will be operational in early 1999.
	   In October, Mannesmann announced the euro.map project and said
it would keep a majority interest. It also said its Italian partner
would hold a minority interest while further partners may join
later.

Talks on shutting Germany's nuke plants to begin in January
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Talks between Germany's new center-left
government and the nuclear industry on shutting down the country's
19 atomic power plants should begin in January, the economics
minister said Thursday.
	   Werner Mueller ruled out government compensation to utility
companies for closing the plants, but told Phoenix television that
he was ``very confident that the talks will be a classic example of
good cooperation between government and business.''
	   He said invitations to the talks would go out in mid-December.
	   In a major policy reversal for Germany, the Social Democrats and
environmentalist Greens agreed in their coalition pact last month
to seek an end to nuclear power in Germany.
	   No deadline was set, but if the talks do not produce a deal
after one year, the government intends to pass legislation setting
a timetable on its own.

Danish goalkeeper to quit Man United at end of season
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with more Schmeichel quotes

<TEXT>
	   MANCHESTER, England (AP) _ Veteran Danish goalkeeper Peter
Schmeichel, who has helped Manchester United to four Premier League
titles in six years, announced Thursday that he's leaving the club
at the end of the season.
	   Schmeichel, who is rated as one of the world's top 'keepers,
said he can't cope any longer with the rigors of English soccer and
hopes to continue his career in another country.
	   Two French clubs, Olympique Marseille and Monaco, have been
linked with the 34-year-old Danish international.
	   ``I am enjoying the game as much as ever but it is getting
harder to keep pace,'' Schmeichel told a news conference at Old
Trafford. ``I need to train more than I have ever had to. And in
order to prepare myself properly, I need more time between games
than I can get in England.
	   ``At the moment, I'm playing two games a week and it's very
difficult for me to get up to the standards you need to be at to
play for Manchester United.''
	   ``I truly believe that if I so somewhere else and have more time
between games, I can put more years on my career and I really want
to do that,'' he said.
	   Despite speculation about a move to France, Schmeichel insisted
he hasn't yet decided on his post-United future.
	   ``It is important that I am now allowed to concentrate totally
on playing for United,'' he said. ``I have had a fantastic career
with United and I owe it to the club, players and fans to do
everything I can to finish on a successful note.''
	   Marseille seems a logical next stop for Schmeichel. On
Wednesday, German 'keeper Andreas Koepke announced he was quitting
the French club amid speculation of a move to Glasgow Rangers.
	   Schmeichel, who joined United from Danish side Brondby in 1991,
has played a key role in making United the most successful English
club of the 1990s.
	   He has helped the Red Devils win four Premier League
championships in the last six years, two FA Cups and the League
Cup. Last February against Derby, he became the first goalkeeper to
register 100 shutouts in the Premiership.
	   ``I'd like most to win the League again because that's the best
trophy to win,'' he said. ``But the Champions League is something
that we've been working very hard to win over the last few years
and if we can finish this year by winning that, that would be
tremendous for me and also for the club.''
	   Schmeichel, who has made more than 300 appearances for United,
has been under increased scrutiny this season because of his age,
injuries and crucial blunders.
	   The Dane's mistake in the last minute of United's Champions
League game against Bayern Munich in September cost the club a
victory.
	   Schmeichel, who turns 35 next week, has also been dogged by
injuries recently and has missed two games this season with back
trouble.
	   United has been reportedly searching for a successor to
Schmeichel and has been consistently linked with Aston Villa's
Australian goalkeeper Mark Bosnich.
	   Schmeichel's current backup at United is 35-year-old Dutch
'keeper Raimond van der Gouw. United's other 'keeper is 20-year-old
Nicky Culkin, who has yet to play a League match for the senior
side.
	   Schmeichel, the starting 'keeper for Denmark during the World
Cup in France, has been capped a national record 107 times, three
more times than Michael Laudrup.

Show of solidarity may not be enough to rebuild Central America

	   MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) _ Celebrities are arriving and
governments are promising millions of dollars, but it's far from
clear whether the show of solidarity will be enough to rebuild
Central America after Hurricane Mitch.
	   The storm that killed 10,000 people has set back the region's
development by years, and many Central Americans say they have seen
little sign of the promised foreign aid.
	   A U.N. agency announced Thursday it was boosting deliveries of
food aid to Honduras, Nicaragua, Guatemala and El Salvador, which
were devastated by mudslides and floods. The Rome-based World Food
Program said it would distribute more than 100,000 tons of rice,
corn, fish and oil over the next six months.
	   ``With emergency assistance, these people are at extreme
nutritional risk _ in addition to facing the threat of cholera and
other diseases from unsanitary conditions throughout the region,''
said Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive director.
	   As well as the United Nations, governments around the world have
promised hundreds of millions of dollars in relief.
	   In a radio address Thursday, Honduran President Carlos Flores
Facusse urged the United States to join other nations in forgiving
Honduras' dlrs 4.3 billion debt and in backing new funds to create
``a massive supply of fresh resources to aid in rebuilding the
country.''
	   Honduras has little direct U.S. debt, but the United States
plays an important role in international organizations to which
Honduras owes money.
	   With so much of Central America in ruins, the aid announced so
far is likely to fall well short of the need. In Honduras alone,
the Inter-American Development Bank has estimated that up to 90
percent of the country's roads and other infrastructure were
destroyed.

 &UR; Italy, US reach accord increasing flights &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Italy and the United States on Thursday signed a
preliminary agreement meant to increase the number of flights
between the two countries and free prices from government
regulations.
	   The agreement would allow U.S. and Italian airlines to fly to
any airport in each other's country, a U.S. Embassy statement said.
Currently, airlines are allowed a limited number of flights and
cannot provide direct flights from all airports.
	   The accord would also open the market to new airlines on both
sides.
	   The two parties plan to finalize the accord once the U.S.
Department of Transportation approves a request by Italy's flag
carrier, Alitalia, to forge an alliance with an American carrier.
	   While Italy's request is being processed, the two sides agreed
to allow each other's airlines to provide one flight per day
between any points in their countries starting April 1, 1999.
	   The United States has signed so-called Open-Skies agreements
with 31 nations.

Vatican sponsors filmfest to promote link with faith
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ The Vatican is helping to sponsor a film festival to
promote links between popular culture and faith.
	   Among the 21 films to be show for free at two Rome cinemas Nov.
17 through Dec. 8. are ``Winter Guest,'' which explores
generational conflict, ``Life is Beautiful,'' the Italian work
which just opened in the United States and which uses humor to
recount the horror of the Holocaust and Steven Spielberg's
``Amistad,'' which deals with slavery.
	   Watching the films should deepen ``the dialogue between faith
and culture,'' Cardinal Paul Poupard said when presenting the
festival.
	   The cardinal added that said Pope John Paul II believes cinema
is ``able to create moments of a extraordinary intensity.''
	   Italy's state film promotion agency is the other big sponsor of
the second edition of the ``International Festival of Spiritual
Cinema.''

Russia and Japan show progress in settling WWII dispute

 &UR; Eds: AMs. UPDATES in new 7th graf with Yeltsin canceling dinner. &QL; 
 &UR; AP Photos Available &QL; 
 &UR; By MITCHELL LANDSBERG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ The leaders of Russia and Japan moved a few small
steps closer Thursday to resolving a land dispute that has
prevented them from formally signing a peace treaty to end World
War II.
	   Dealing from their respective strengths, Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi of Japan opened his pocketbook, peeling off nearly dlrs 1
billion in loans and aid, while President Boris Yeltsin of Russia
opened his borders, just a crack, in signals of good will in the
dispute over the Kuril Islands.
	   The islands, just north of the main Japanese islands, were
seized by the Soviet Union at the end of World War II. Japan has
maintained that the seizure was illegal, and has refused to
recognize Russia's sovereignty over the islands.
	   The four Kurils are now so impoverished that some of their
17,000 Russian residents have taken up a petition asking that the
islands be handed over to Japan. But they are surrounded by prime
fishing grounds that are coveted by both nations.
	   In the first formal visit by a Japanese prime minister to Russia
in 25 years, Obuchi met Yeltsin at the Kremlin and was handed
Russia's long-awaited response to Japan's proposals to settle the
Kuril dispute.
	   The summit was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting since his
latest illness sidelined him a month ago. He was shown on Russian
television greeting the Japanese leader with a smile and handshake,
appearing somewhat steadier than he has in public recently.
	   Later Thursday, Yeltsin unexpectedly canceled a dinner with
Obuchi, sending Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov instead. The
Kremlin gave no explanation for the change of plans, but said it
was not related to Yeltsin's health.
	   No details of Yeltsin's plan were released, but Russian Foreign
Minister Igor Ivanov said it called for ``joint economic
management'' of the islands.
	   Obuchi's spokesman, Sadaaki Numata, said Japan would have no
immediate response to the Russian proposal. But, he said, ``I think
we are solidly on the way ... to a peace treaty by 2000.''
	   He said Japan would formally respond at the next meeting of the
two leaders. He said Obuchi had invited Yeltsin to visit Japan ``at
the earliest opportunity'' in 1999, and Yeltsin had agreed.
	   In another step forward, the two leaders agreed to establish two
new subcommittees _ one to seek a solution to the territorial
dispute, and another to look into joint economic development of the
islands.
	   ``There is a very strong interest on the Japanese side about the
return of these islands,'' Numata said. ``There is a very keen
interest on the Russian side about the economic development or
activities on the islands. So we have these two committees working
... to meet these interests.''
	   Japan agreed to bankroll the economic development of the islands
with dlrs 100 million. It also agreed to free up dlrs 800 million
of a previously agreed-upon loan to Russia, and to give dlrs 10
million in medical assistance and dlrs 20 million to promote youth
exchange programs.
	   Russia, in turn, agreed to a sentimental Japanese request to
allow aging Japanese natives of the islands, driven out during the
war, to return and see their old homes.
	   Although the meeting produced progress, a final agreement is
expected to be a long, difficult process.
	   Tokyo received legal control of the islands now in contention _
Etorofu, Kunashiri, Shikotan and the Habomai islets _ in a treaty
with Russia in 1875. The Soviet Union took them back in the closing
days of World War II, a move Japan has protested ever since.
	   Former Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto presented
Tokyo's proposals for ending the dispute when he and Yeltsin met in
Japan in April. The proposals have not been made public.
	   According to media reports, Tokyo has suggested an arrangement
that would recognize Japanese sovereignty over the islands, but
would allow Russia to retain control for some time.

Colombian rebels assume responsiblility for pipeline explosion that
</HEADLINE>
killed 70 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ Colombia's rebels accepted
responsibility for causing 70 civilian deaths last month in a blaze
triggered when its forces dynamited an oil pipeline, an admission
the defense minister welcomed Thursday as clearing the way for
peace.
	   ``It was a grave error by the comrades who carried out the
action,'' top commander Nicolas Rodriguez of the National
Liberation Army, or ELN, said in a video aired Wednesday night on
Colombian television. Guerrilla saboteurs ``failed to take into
account the possible consequences of the crude spill,'' he added.
	   The ELN had initially suggested that the Colombian army
triggered the Oct. 18 blaze that engulfed Machuca, a village in the
northwestern state of Antioquia just downstream from the ruptured
pipeline.
	   The rebel admission ``is something the organization should have
done three weeks ago because it was evident that the explosion,
although not intentionally, set the fire,'' Defense Minister
Rodrigo Lloreda said in a radio interview.
	   He said the ELN statement improves the climate for peace with
the 5,000-member guerrilla group, Colombia's second largest.
	   Peace talks between the government and the 15,000-member
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are expected before year's
end, and talks with the ELN are scheduled to begin in February.

IAEA supports completion of nuclear plant in Temelin, the plant
</HEADLINE>
says &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) _ The International Atomic Energy
Agency supports the completion of a controversal nuclear plant near
the Austrian border, a Czech official said Thursday.
	   The news agency CTK quoted plant spokesman Milan Nebesar as
saying that Mohamed M. El Baradei, the director general of the
Vienna-based agency, expressed full support for the construction of
the plant during his visit to Temelin Thursday.
	   According to Nebesar, El Baradei promised any possible
assistance within the IAEA's powers, CTK said.
	   The IAEA does not publish reports on member countries' nuclear
plants, but leaves it to individual governments to do so.
	   The Soviet-designed 2,000 megawatt plant, located only about 50
kilometers (30 miles) from the border with Austria, was originally
planned in the 1980s by the former Communist regime.
	   In Austria, where nuclear power is banned by law,
environmentalists have been campaigning against the project for
years, and the Vienna government has tried in vain to persuade the
Czechs to abandon it as a potential hazard.
	   It had been expected that the plant would go on line in 1996.
But technical problems - caused mainly by melding the original
project with western safety and control systems - have caused
significant delays.
	   Some 63 billion koruna (dlrs 1.9 billion) have been invested so
far into Temelin, and total costs are expected to reach 100 billion
koruna (dlrs 3 billion).

Mandela calls for stronger ties during Chilean president visit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRETORIA, South Africa (AP) _ President Nelson Mandela on
Thursday said South Africa and Chile share a legacy of lagging
development and historic repression that invite closer ties between
the two countries.
	   Speaking at a banquet to welcome Chilean President Eduardo Frei
at the start of a two-day visit, Mandela said Chile's growth rate
also encouraged South Africa to strive for ``sustained growth'' in
a global economic system that was still riddled with disparities.
	   ``Our two countries have ... learnt the lesson of an era of
increasing interdependence, that the problems we face are beyond
the capacity of any one of us to solve on our own,'' Mandela said.
	   Frei arrived five hours late, after his flight out of Buenos
Aires, Argentina, was delayed by a bomb threat.
	   Mandela and Frei are to sign a new treaty to protect mutual
investments that is expected to boost trade, estimated at about 716
million rand (dlrs 128 million) a year. The figure represented an
increase of about 14 percent over the previous year, officials
said.
	   The mining sector holds particularly strong potential for
development. Chilean mines import extensive mining technology from
South Africa, such as conveyor belts and biotechnology.
	   South Africa is currently the third largest foreign investor in
Chile, after the United States and Canada, with about 8.2 billion
rand (dlrs 1.46 billion) invested in mining.
	   On Friday, Frei is scheduled to meet with South African
entrepreneurs and to visit a memorial to the anti-apartheid
struggle in Soweto, the black township south of Johannesburg.
	   When white minority rule ended in South Africa in 1994,
Mandela's newly elected government drew upon Chile's experience in
reconciling with decades of military oppression.
	   The input helped South Africa form its own Truth and
Reconciliation Commission that investigated human rights abuses
during apartheid.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Tensions simmered in Kosovo on
Thursday as armed Serb civilians held dozens of ethnic Albanians
hostage and Albanian rebels vowed revenge for five dead comrades.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Kosovo Albanian
leadership, first said 20 ethnic Albanians were abducted. Later, it
said up to 100 were taken hostage. The figures could not be
independently confirmed.
	   The Serb abductors were seeking the release of two fellow Serbs
who went missing Wednesday in the central Drenica region. The
Kosovo Information Center said some of those detained were
threatened with ``liquidation'' unless the two Serbs were released.
	   The ethnic Albanians were reportedly taken off a bus to the
village of Crnac, 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   Serb sources confirmed the abduction but said those taken were
being released. One of those released, Rahim Kadriu, said about 30
people remained in the custody of the Serbs.
	   William Walker, the American heading a still-forming
international team of Kosovo monitors, said his people would ``take
appropriate steps'' after finding out exact circumstances of the
abductions.
	   The detentions reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian
tensions in Kosovo despite a lessening of bloodshed in the wake of
an Oct. 12 agreement aimed at ending a months-long crackdown on
Kosovo Albanian guerrillas fighting for independence.
	   The crackdown in the Albanian-majority Serbian province left
hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
results from the October agreement were taking shape, ``but we have
a long way to go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet Walker, said he would
be going to Belgrade on Friday to talk with Serb authorities on
implementation of a plan that would give Kosovo Albanians wide
autonomy.
	   In the western village of Retimlje, about 100 uniformed Kosovo
Liberation Army guerrillas attended a memorial for two of five
fighters killed last week. Many cried openly during an emotional
speech by Sebajdin Cena, a KLA commander.
	   Gjelal Hajda, 31, and Selajdin Mullaabazi, 28, died when their
cars encountered a Serb police patrol near the village of Opterusa.
Police said the guerrillas fired first.
	   ``Their deaths unite us even more, and their blood gives us more
strength,'' said Cena.
	   The dead guerrillas ``will constantly ask us ... `Have you
fulfilled our last wish, did you take revenge for us?' We tell them
... that we continue to fight, we continue to spill blood because
we are the sons of Albanians,'' Cena said.
	   Two members of the Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission, Jasper
Christoffesen of Denmark and Ulrich Bucher of Germany, attended the
memorial service as observers.
	   ``If the police attack any families here, we won't stand with
our hands tied,'' one KLA member, who identified himself only by
his nickname, Omega, told the two observers. ``We will attack
Orahovac'' _ a nearby town populated by both Serbs and Albanians.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister on Thursday
accused President Clinton of blocking the lifting of U.N. sanctions
against his country.
	   ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally
by (Clinton's) government'' Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad.
	   ``Who is blocking the way toward sincere cooperation? It's he
(Clinton) and his government, not the president of Iraq and the
government of Iraq,'' Aziz said.
	   ``When speaking of compliance, it's the United States that's not
complying,'' Aziz told a news conference.
	   ``If this crisis is going to escalate into an aggression, it's
their decision ... and it's not the responsibility of Iraq because
Iraq showed cooperation'' with U.N. inspectors charged with
verifying that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Aziz also criticized chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler of
pulling out his monitors from Iraq without consulting the U.N.
secretary-general.
	   Aziz spoke hours after a second batch of U.N. relief workers
left Iraq by bus on Thursday, and the ruling party's newspaper
condemned the increasing possibility of U.S. air strikes as
American ``psychological warfare.''

German government wants to ban slaps for children
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Germany wants to make it illegal to slap or
spank children, the new liberal government's justice minister said
Thursday.
	   Herta Daeubler-Gmelin said she would propose the measure as a
way to protect not only children but also women, elderly people and
the handicapped against repeated physical violence.
	   ``The idea isn't to send a district attorney after a mother or
father if their hand slips once in a stressful situation,'' she
said during a debate in parliament.
	   However, the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Greens
that emerged from September elections has said they also see the
law as discouraging the occasional slap on the behind of a child.
	   Daeubler-Gmelin said the ``scourge of violence'' in the home had
to end.
	   She did not say what punishment should apply, but other
coalition members have said they don't envision severe penalties.
	   Organizations dedicated to the child protection have welcomed
the proposal.

Veba says profits down, RWE posts gains
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) _ German utility group Veba AG said
Thursday that nine-month net profit declined as expected on losses
from telecoms startups, and announced it will refocus on core
businesses.
	   At the same time, utility RWE AG posted strong gains in its
first quarter despite losses in telecoms operations.
	   RWE's 54 percent growth in first-quarter net profit to 306
million marks (dlrs 191 million) including extraordinary gains
looked better than Veba's 16.3 percent net profit decline to 1.75
billion marks (dlrs 1.1 billion) in the first nine months.
	   But analysts see higher earnings potential at diversified
industrial group Veba, forecasting double-digit growth rates for
net profit in the second half of 1999.
	   While analysts don't find Veba shares attractive now, they said
the stock may become more appealing after the company carries out
plans to focus on its three core divisions: energy, specialty
chemicals and telecommunications.
	   Investors, however, considered RWE stock a better buy and shed
Veba shares Thursday.

Rome city council debates new cab rules, drivers in uproar
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: for AMs. Recasts, updates throughout; Changes byline.
 &UR; By CANDICE HUGHES &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Thousands of cab drivers from throughout Italy
converged on the capital Thursday in a show of solidarity with
Roman cabbies striking to protest the city's attempt to open their
business up to competition.
	   The demonstration came at the end of a four-day cab strike
preceded by weeks of sporadic one-day taxi strikes. It was timed to
coincide with the beginning of the city council debate Thursday on
new regulations for the taxi industry.
	   Mayor Francesco Rutelli moved to change rules for the cabs after
the national Antitrust Authority concluded that Rome's taxi
situation had the makings of a cartel.
	   His proposals are aimed at putting more cabs on the streets and
giving passengers some bargaining power when it comes to fares.
	   The fierce resistance his proposals have provoked illustrate how
difficult reform can be in Italy, where the idea of fostering
competition is relatively new.
	   Cabbies bearing banners decrying the proposals marched through
the streets of Rome to the Piazza Venezia in the heart of the city.
The piazza was closed to vehicles for hours, snarling traffic for
blocks around.
	   Taxi drivers from Milan, Turin, Genoa, Naples and Venice took
part in the demonstration. And in Venice, where drivers are on
strike to protest plans for 300 more licenses, water taxis took to
the city's lagoons in a show of support for their Roman colleagues.
	   The city of Rome wants to take the lid off shifts, so cabbies
can work as many hours as they like. It also wants to let cabbies
offer discounts.
	   The upshot of these proposals could mean that cabbies might have
to hustle harder for business. But it also could mean that there
would be cabs on the street when people want them _ and that
passengers could look for good deals.
	   ``We now have times of the day when there are customers without
cabs and times when there are cabs lined up without customers,''
Rossella Panarese, a spokeswoman for traffic commissioner Walter
Tocci, said earlier this week.
	   Cabbies, most of whom own their taxis, claim there isn't much to
shave off after paying for taxes, maintenance and fuel, which runs
close to a dollar per liter (more than dlrs 4 a gallon).

Soccer body looks to help Central American Mitch victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ An officer of World soccer's
governing body has gone to Central America to determine what aid
FIFA should provide to victims of Hurricane Mitch, a statement
said.
	   Angel Maria Villar, president of the Spanish football
association and a member of the FIFA Executive committee, flew to
Nicaragua on Thursday for a first hand review of the needs of the
country and Honduras, it said.
	   He is being joined by Sasso Sasso, the Costa Rican member of the
FIFA committee and the two will report back to FIFA in time for a
Dec. 3 meeting in Zurich to ``decide on appropriate action,'' the
statement said.
	   It said the aid would be sent to the football associations of
the countries.

	   GRAD OTOCEC, Slovenia (AP) _ Six-time gymnastics medalist Leon
Stukelj, the oldest living Olympian, turned 100 in style Thursday
with celebratory events across Slovenia and a visit from the head
of the Olympic movement.
	   ``When I woke up this morning, I realized that I'm 100 now, and
I thought about it for a while,'' a jovial Stukelj told reporters.
``Then I realized that I'm doing just fine and I'm glad I could
come here to be with you.''
	   Juan Antonio Samaranch, chief of the International Olympic
Committee, was the first guest of honor at Stukelj's birthday gala.
	   He commended not only Stukelj's sports victories, but his
life-long contributions to his community. ``Most importantly, Mr.
Stukelj is a real gentleman: he's honoring sports, his country and
the Olympic movement.''
	   The old Slovene gymnast, fighting a cold, missed the opening in
his hometown of Maribor of an exhibition of rewards and photos that
he collected through years.
	   But he did appear later in Grad Otocec, a picturesque city on an
island in the Krka river, where the Slovene government arranged a
birthday luncheon for him and his guests.
	   Asked whether he would prefer to celebrate with his family
alone, Stukelj replied : ``My age is really something exceptional.
And you know, I have that problem that I'm the owner of three
Olympic gold medals.''
	   He recalled his seventh birthday, when he wished to become a
gymnast.
	   His wish came true.
	   Stukelj won Olympic golds in the horizontal bar and all-around
competition at Paris in 1924, which he said Thursday had been the
most important thing in his life. He won another gold in the rings
at Amsterdam in 1928. He also won two bronze medals at Amsterdam,
in the all-around and team exercises, and a silver in the rings at
Berlin in 1936.
	   He was so good that one of his trademark moves is still known as
the Stukelj maneuver.
	   Stukelj went on to work as a judge and also wrote books on
gymnastics. He remains involved in Slovenia's sports life, and has
kept up his health by working out on rings in his apartment and by
taking hour-long walks in a a nearby park.
	   Samaranch, who gave Stukelj a silver cup on behalf of the
Olympic committee, invited Stukelj to come to the 2000 Olympic
games in Sydney. Stukelj was present at the Atlanta games in 1996.
	   To show further appreciation, Samaranch suggested that Stukelj,
should present medals to gymnasts in Sydney.
	   ``I do not know in what condition I'd be in 2000,'' Stukelj, who
would then be 102, said. ``When 2000 comes, we'll talk again.''
	   Later, a ceremony was planned on the main square in Novo Mesto,
where Stukelj was born in 1898. A gala gymnastic event was
scheduled in his honor in the city's sports hall afterward.

	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel angered Palestinians Thursday by giving
the go-ahead for construction of a Jewish housing project in a
disputed area of Jerusalem, but also pledged to begin turning over
West Bank territory next week.
	   Dennis Ross, the United States special Middle East envoy, is to
arrive here Friday to oversee implementation of the nascent Mideast
land-for-security accord, and Palestinian officials were already
calling on him to help solve the latest disputes.
	   ``It is now crucial to have the American side join us ... to
oversee implementation of the agreement, '' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. He told The Associated Press, ``We will not
accept any post-agreement negotiations and will not accept any
conditions outside,'' the accord itself, signed at the White House
Oct. 26.
	   Under the accord narrowly ratified by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Cabinet Wednesday, Israel is to carry out a staged
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security measures.
	   Israel's plans to hand over the first parcel of land Sunday,
said David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu. And there were
signs on the ground Thursday that implementation of some aspects
was close.
	   At the Palestinian airport in Gaza, near the Egyptian border,
Israeli and Palestinian officials drilled security procedures for
checking passengers.
	   Israeli soldiers were seen pulling equipment out of an army base
in the West Bank, near the Palestinian village of Dura. It was not
clear if the base is to be evacuated as part of the Israeli
redeployment.
	   However, Palestinians focused attention on Israel's decision to
accept bids for construction at a Jerusalem hilltop Israelis call
Har Homa and Palestinians know as Jebel Abu Ghneim. The hilltop is
part of land Israel captured from Jordan and annexed after the 1967
Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a
future state in the area.
	   Ground breaking there in January, 1997 for the 6,000 homes
planned for Jews, led to Palestinian rioting and a 19-month-long
stalemate in negotiations broken after Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed the latest peace deal. Netanyahu has
promised repeatedly the new homes would be ready there in 2000.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an aide to Arafat, called the project and a
series of new Israeli conditions on the peace accord, ``a violation
of the ... agreement and of all agreements.''
	   Wednesday, Netanyahu warned that if the Palestinians go through
with a plan to unilaterally declare independence when the interim
peace accords expire in May, Israel will annex all West Bank
territory it still controls.
	   Arafat left the issue open, saying the issue of statehood could
be negotiated.
	   ``May 4 is the end of the five-year period we agreed upon in
Oslo. If there are other ideas, I'm ready to listen,'' Arafat was
quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
	   GRAD OTOCEC, Slovenia (AP) _ Six-time gymnastics medalist Leon
Stukelj, the oldest living Olympian, turned 100 in style Thursday
with celebratory events across Slovenia and a visit from the head
of the Olympic movement.
	   ``When I woke up this morning, I realized that I'm 100 now, and
I thought about it for a while,'' a jovial Stukelj told reporters.
``Then I realized that I'm doing just fine and I'm glad I could
come here to be with you.''
	   Juan Antonio Samaranch, chief of the International Olympic
Committee, was the first guest of honor at Stukelj's birthday gala.
	   He commended not only Stukelj's sports victories, but his
life-long contributions to his community. ``Most importantly, Mr.
Stukelj is a real gentleman: he's honoring sports, his country and
the Olympic movement.''
	   The old Slovene gymnast, fighting a cold, missed the opening in
his hometown of Maribor of an exhibition of rewards and photos that
he collected through years.
	   But he did appear later in Grad Otocec, a picturesque city on an
island in the Krka river, where the Slovene government arranged a
birthday luncheon for him and his guests.
	   Asked whether he would prefer to celebrate with his family
alone, Stukelj replied : ``My age is really something exceptional.
And you know, I have that problem that I'm the owner of three
Olympic gold medals.''
	   He recalled his seventh birthday, when he wished to become a
gymnast.
	   His wish came true.

at Amsterdam in 1928. He also won two bronze medals at Amsterdam,

Morocco's Abouyoub pledges efforts to `bridge the gap'

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Moroccan candidate Hassan Abouyoub called for
``fresh efforts of adjustment and change'' Thursday as World Trade
Organization members wrapped up consideration of four leadership
hopefuls.
	   Abouyoub, 46, led Morocco's entry to the 132-nation WTO's
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and its
trade negotiations with the European Union. He is now an ambassador
in charge of trade negotiations.
	   He is one of four candidates to replace outgoing WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero, who will step down by the end of
April.
	   Although the trade watchdog's new chief will have a ``mission''
to bring on board some 30 countries who are waiting to join,
``nobody is prepared to discount on principles,'' Abouyoub said.
	   He added that he would work to ``bridge the gap between the rich
and poor in the institution.''
	   WTO members will decide the leadership contest by consensus
rather than a vote and the body hopes to confirm the appointment by
the end of this year.
	   The other candidates _ Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, former New Zealand premier Mike Moore, and former
Canadian trade minister Roy Maclaren _ have already faced trade
ambassadors this week.

Russia expects to begin receiving E.U. food aid in January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS to UPDATE with Russian government seeking to
reschedule Soviet debt, central bank expecting 720 banks to fail.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's government said Thursday it would seek a
second restructuring of its Soviet-era debt, further undermining
its sullied reputation among foreign creditors.
	   The announcement, though not surprising, was another blow to
Russia's crumbling economy.
	   Meanwhile, Russian officials bracing for a harsh winter were on
the verge of signing a food aid deal with the European Union that
would start providing wheat, rice, beef and pork in early January.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said in an interview
published Thursday that Russia would be asking creditors for some
``breathing space on the payments of the debt in the next year or
two.''
	   The Soviet-debt payments are part of the dlrs 17.5 billion that
Russia was to pay foreign creditors next year.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov has said the
government was seeking to reschedule the payments, but he did not
specify whether it would restructure Russian or Soviet debt.
	   Foreign lenders expected the government to try to pay off the
newer, Russian debt first, and Kasyanov's announcement, in an
interview with the business daily Kommersant, confirmed the
speculations. Kasyanov did not rule out the possibility that the
government would want to reschedule the Russian debt as well.
	   Russia inherited about dlrs 100 billion in total Soviet debt in
1991, and dlrs 160 billion in non-performing loans the Soviet Union
had made to developing countries.
	   Under a 1996 Paris Club agreement, Russia was granted a grace
period through 2002, during which it only has to make debt service
payments.
	   ``Rescheduling previously rescheduled debt is not good news,''
Charles Blitzer, economist with Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette
investment bank in London, said Thursday. ``It ... is not a good
sign about how Russia views its position as a creditor nation.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said Thursday that Russia
expects to wrap up the EU food aid deal soon and should begin
receiving it in January.
	   The Russian government last week signed a separate food aid
agreement with the United States as part of an effort to ensure
that stockpiles last until the spring.
	   The EU package is expected to be worth about dlrs 480 million
and consist of 1 million metric tons (1.1 million tons) of wheat,
and smaller amounts of rye, rice, pork, beef and vegetable oils.
	   Russia has not experienced any serious food shortages so far,
but the government doesn't want to risk getting caught short in the
middle of winter, when deliveries to remote areas are difficult and
expensive.
	   In a new sign of trouble for the Russian banks, Central Bank
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said the government won't bail out
domestic banks whose overseas assets are frozen by foreign
creditors.
	   A government-declared moratorium on debt payments that had
protected Russian banks is due to expire within days.
	   Central Bank's deputy chairman Andrei Kozlov said that more than
700 Russian commercial banks will fail, because the government does
not have the 80 billion rubles (dlrs 5 billion) to save them.
	   The banks hold 32 percent of all private deposits in the
country, the Interfax news agency reported. Many private bank
accounts have been frozen since Russia devalued the ruble and froze
some of its debts in August.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov struck a similar tone Wednesday
when he said the government would not guarantee private deposits in
commercial banks.
	   ``We live in a market economy,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``If Russians want guarantees, they should
put their money in Sberbank,'' the national savings bank.

U.N. stages second evacuation of relief workers from Iraq

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A second group of U.N. relief workers left
Iraq Thursday, and Arab ministers warned that Iraq alone would be
responsible for the consequences of halting U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   Meanwhile, Iraq's deputy prime minister accused U.S. President
Bill Clinton of blocking the lifting of U.N. sanctions against his
country.
	   ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally
by (Clinton's) government,'' Tariq Aziz told reporters in Baghdad.
	   U.N. humanitarian program spokesman Eric Falt said 25 workers
left instead of the 40 that officials initially decided would go.
He did not elaborate. Another 130 left Wednesday for Amman, Jordan,
the same day all 103 U.N. weapons inspectors flew to Bahrain.
	   About 295 humanitarian workers remain in Iraq, mostly in the
Kurdish north, which is unlikely to be targeted. All relief workers
thus far evacuated have been based in southern and central Iraq,
Falt said.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
response since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   On Thursday, Arab foreign ministers held Iraq responsible for
the consequences of refusing to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The statement by foreign ministers of eight Arab nations
appeared to be a warning to Iraq that it should not count on Arab
support in its dispute with the United Nations.
	   The statement made no mention of the United States or any
possible military action against Iraq, but expressed hope that
``wisdom and restraint prevail so that the United Nations can reach
a solution to the crisis.''
	   Aziz dismissed the statement, saying the Arab ministers should
blame the United States, not Iraq. ``We are sincere in dealing with
this situation,'' he said.
	   A major buildup of warplanes and troops in the Gulf continued
Thursday. Five U.S. Navy warships, including an aircraft carrier
and a submarine, are scheduled to cross the Suez Canal next week on
their way to the gulf, canal officials said Thursday.
	   There are already 23,400 U.S. troops in the Gulf in addition to
174 aircraft, 21 ships and nine vessels armed with Tomahawk
missiles, according to the Pentagon.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday urged the United
States to exercise restraint and avoid striking at Iraq, a move the
Palestinian leader said would be detrimental to Mideast peace.
	   Despite mounting military threats, Iraq showed no sign of
letting U.N. arms inspections to resume. Official Iraqi newspapers
published a statement Thursday by the ruling Baath party urging
Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at American interests
in case of U.S. aggression.
	   In a front-page editorial, the Baath party newspaper al-Thawra
said the U.S. military preparations in the Gulf were part of
American ``psychological warfare.''
	   ``Iraq no longer pays attention to these empty threats,'' it
said, asserting that Iraq will not back down.
	   The official al-Qadissiya newspaper said President Saddam
Hussein's Cabinet discussed the crisis Wednesday. Iraq's five
official dailies published pictures of Saddam meeting ministers and
senior military commanders to discuss a response to ``American and
Zionist aggression.''
	   Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride, and there
was little evidence of panic or people rushing to stockpile food.
	   Clinton has warned that spurning U.N. demands for arms
inspections would be a costly mistake for Iraq. The U.N. Security
Council has backed Secretary-General Kofi Annan's call to Saddam to
immediately resume cooperation with the inspectors.
	   Iraq says it will not do so unless the council moves to begin
lifting trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But the council is bound by a resolution that will not allow the
lifting of sanctions until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
dismantled its nuclear program, biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   The sanctions have contributed to Iraq's economic devastation.
Recognizing the plight of the Iraqis, the United Nations has
allowed Iraq to sell limited quantities of crude oil to buy food
and medicine for its 22 million people.
	   Among those staying in Iraq were U.N. envoy Prakash Shah and
Hans von Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian operations who took
up his post in Iraq on Monday. Von Sponeck said the evacuation
would slow some distribution of relief supplies.
	   ``Our capacity is much reduced,'' von Sponeck said. ``But
whatever capacity we have we will utilize for our humanitarian
program.''
	   The pullout is likely to halt the work of other specialized
agencies such as the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Health Organization.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz had sent a letter to Annan complaining about
the withdrawal of the weapons inspectors, saying that UNSCOM was
following U.S. orders and using the United Nations as ``false
cover.''

Daimler-Benz, Chrysler complete dlrs 75 billion merger
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz confirmed the completion
of its dlrs 75 billion merger with Chrysler on Thursday, creating
the world's third-largest automobile company based on 1997
revenues.
	   The new DaimlerChrysler AG will have operational headquarters in
Stuttgart, Germany and in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
	   The statement lists 12 shareholder representatives that will
make up DaimlerChrysler's Supervisory board, including Hilmar
Kopper the chairman of Deutsche Bank, and Robert E. Allen, the
former chairman of the board and chief executive at and T.
	   The supervisory board will be organized under the German
Co-determination Law as soon as requisite legal proceedings can be
completed, the statement said.
	   At that time, the number of shareholder representatives will be
reduced from 12 to 10, with 10 employee representatives added to
constitute a 20 member supervisory board, the statement said.
	   Terms of the merger were approved by Daimler-Benz and Chrysler
shareholders at meetings held on Sept. 18.
	   Under an exchange offer completed on Nov. 6, Daimler-Benz
shareholders receive 1.005 shares of the newly formed
DaimlerChrysler AG for each Daimler-Benz share.
	   The companies said that the offer, which attracted over 98
percent of Daimler-Benz shares, and a recently completed Chrysler
share contribution would permit the new company to use pooling of
interests accounting and avoid goodwill charges in reporting future
results.
	   Chrysler shareholders receive 0.6235 of a DaimlerChrysler share
for each Chrysler share, the statement said.
	   Chrysler shares will cease trading on the New York Stock
Exchange at the close of business Thursday, the statement said.
	   Trading with the DCX symbol is scheduled to commence on both the
NYSE and Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
	   Daimler will remain listed as a separate company in Germany
until lawsuits filed by shareholders challenging the stock swap are
resolved.
	   Deutsche Bank has been appointed the exchange agent for
Daimler-Benz shares. The Bank of New York is acting as the exchange
agent for Chrysler shares, the statement said.
	   Daimler-Benz AG of Stuttgart is a holding company with diverse
operations and Europe's largest industrial group.
	   Its operations include the Mercedes-Benz car and truck division,
Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA) and financial services unit,
Daimler-Benz Interservice AG (Debis).

 &UR; Liverpool loses last link with Shankly era

<TEXT>
	   LIVERPOOL, England (AP) _ When Roy Evans resigned Thursday as
co-manager of Liverpool, leaving Frenchman Gerard Houllier in sole
charge, the Merseyside club lost its last tangible link with its
glorious past.
	   The foundations of the glamor side of British soccer in the
1970s and '80s evolved out of Bill Shankly's period as manager in
the 1960s and early '70s, when Evans started as a bit player.
	   Shankly joined Liverpool in a time of crisis but transformed the
struggling Reds into champions. Along the way, he engendered his
own style and embraced the support of a trusted few.
	   The behind-closed-doors dealings in Shankly's era were conducted
in the Boot Room, not the boardroom. It was there, in the bowels of
the Anfield stadium, where the likes of Shankly and Paisley would
meet to devise strategies.
	   In 1994, when the club faced another crisis, management returned
to the Boot Room in a bid to evoke some of the spirits of Liverpool
legends and appointed Evans as manager.
	   On Evans' appointment, Liverpool chairman David Moores described
Evans as the ``last of the Shankly lads.''
	   But on Thursday, Moores conceded that the Shankly era was over
when he announced that Evans had resigned by mutual consent.
	   ``I was offered another job at this club, but I didn't want to
hang around as a ghost on the wall,'' Evans said. ``But the spirit
of the Boot Room boys will live on.''
	   Evans couldn't reproduce the spectacular results of his mentors
and the board has opted for a new direction and once again called
on outside help.
	   As well as steering Liverpool to three league championships, in
1964, 1966 and 1973, FA Cup titles in 1965 and 1974 and the UEFA
Cup in 1974, Shankly and his then deputy Bob Paisley convinced a
25-year-old Evans to quit playing and start coaching.
	   When Paisley _ the most successful manager in English soccer
history with six league titles in eight years _ succeeded Shankly
in 1974, he appointed Evans as his reserve team coach.
	   Evans had joined the club as a 16-year-old apprentice player in
1965 but only played 11 first team games in his 33 year association
with the club.
	   In 1974, Evans' appointment was regarded as an investment in the
future. He became the man primed to assume the helm.
	   Initially Evans' coaching techniques won nine Central League
titles in 11 years, starting with a title in his first year as a
coach in 1975. He gradually rose through the ranks and took on the
first team job when Graeme Souness resigned with the club in
turmoil.
	   Evans' only legacy to the club in four years as manager was the
1995 League Cup and a host of near misses.
	   Despite consistent top five league finishes and his reputation
as the ``nice guy'' of the league, Evans failed where his
predecessors had succeeded.
	   Despite playing a role in the treble winning 1984 campaign under
Joe Fagan and the FA Cup and League double in 1986 under Kenny
Dalglish, Evans could not produce a major trophy with millions of
dollars at his disposal to buy players.
	   In the end, with all the credentials and experience he gained
over more than two decades as a coach, it was his management style
which let him down.
	   Critics accused him of not inspiring his players or giving his
teams the will to win.
	   The inevitable end came this week after two successive home
defeats and Liverpool slumped into the bottom half of the
standings.
	   Liverpool's gamble to use a management partnership to break the
trophy drought failed and Evans, always with the club as his major
priority, decided to make way for Houllier.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Should Britain's highest court rule in
favor Gen. Augusto Pinochet, British police would not any accept
other arrest warrants against the former Chilean dictator, deputy
Foreign Minister Mariano Fernandez said Thursday.
	   Returning from London, Fernandez said that such a ruling by the
House of Lords ``would clear the way'' for Pinochet to return home.
	   He told reporters at the airport that he received assurances
from British authorities that should the Lords uphold an earlier
ruling that recognized Pinochet's state immunity, police would not
accept any other arrest warrants against the 82-year-old retired
general.
	   The six-day proceedings closed Thursday at the House of Lords
without an indication on when a ruling will be issued.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London while recovering from
back surgery, on a warrant issued by Spanish judge Baltasar Garzon
who wants to try him on genocide, torture and murder charges.

Clement defeats Lareau in Kremlin Cup quarterfinal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Ivanisevic-Burgsmuller match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Arnaud Clement of France and Croatia's Goran
Ivanisevic advanced to the semifinals of the dlrs 1.1 million
Kremlin Cup in Moscow on Thursday.
	   Ivanisevic said that even if he continues to win, he won't go to
the ATP Championship in Hanover, Germany, because of a shoulder
injury.
	   ``This is the last tournament for me, and I want to finish the
year in a good way,'' he told reporters. ``It would be nice to win
here. ... But whatever I do, I'm not going to Hanover.''
	   Third-seeded Ivanisevic whipped German qualifier Lars
Burgsmuller in straight sets.
	   Ivanisevic, 1996 Kremlin Cup champion, fired twelve aces.
Burgsmuller, 22, had only one break point in the first game of the
second set but failed to convert on a deuce.
	   Clement beat Canada's Sebastien Lareau 6-3, 7-5 to reach his
first ATP Tour semifinal. Twenty-year-old Clement held his serve
and didn't allow Lareau a single break point.
	   Lareau, a Canadian doubles specialist, wasn't serving as
consistently as he did Wednesday _ when he upset top-seeded Alex
Corretja _ and he double-faulted six times.
	   Clement broke the Canadian in the eighth game of the first set
and went to deuce in the 12th game of the second before blasting an
ace to win the match.
	   ``When I came here I didn't expect to reach the semifinals,''
Clement said.

Turkish government at brink of collapse
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recasts for AMs.
 &UR; By SELCAN HACAOGLU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ A key ally defected to the opposition on
Thursday, bringing Turkey's fourth coalition government in three
years to the edge of collapse over a privatization scandal. A
coalition partner, meanwhile, debated withdrawing its support.
	   The leader of the Republican People's Party, Deniz Baykal, filed
a no-confidence motion Thursday against Prime Minister Mesut
Yilmaz, siding with two opposition parties which lodged similar
motions a day earlier.
	   With the pivotal Republicans turning on him, Yilmaz' 16
month-old government has little hope of survival.
	   The motions accuse Yilmaz of abusing his power and being linked
to organized crime.
	   They were not expected to be debated before next week, but a
decision from a coalition partner, the Democratic Turkey Party, on
withdrawing from the government was expected sooner.
	   The crisis began Wednesday when a businessman linked to the
mafia claimed Yilmaz rigged the privatization of a state-run bank
in his favor. Yilmaz denied any wrongdoing, saying he was trying to
keep the mafia out of the deal and get the highest price possible.
	   Three governments have collapsed since the Islamic party won the
1995 elections. New elections are now planned for April.
	   If the premier resigns, President Suleyman Demirel has several
options, including appointing a caretaker government.
	   Yilmaz came to power in July 1997 after the military forced out
an Islamic-led government for its anti-secular policies.
	   In another blow against the Islamic party, police on Thursday
detained Ankara Mayor Melih Gokcekb on charges of favoring some
private firms in municipality contracts.
	   His detention follows the conviction of Istanbul Islamic Mayor
Recep Tayyip Erdogan for reading an anti-secular poem at a
political rally. The city council on Thursday elected an Islamic
replacement.

Liverpool goes French; Man United loses Dane Schmeichel
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ It was just another day of tumult in English
soccer _ with a Frenchman and a Dane stealing the headlines.
	   Frenchman Gerard Houllier took over as sole manager of
Liverpool, while world-class Danish goalkeeper Peter Schmeichel
announced he was leaving Manchester United at the end of the
season.
	   Roy Evans, after 33 years at Liverpool as a player, coach and
manager, held back tears as he turned the struggling Reds over to
former French national coach Houllier.
	   Houllier, who joined the team over the summer as co-manager with
Evans, became the first foreign coach to have full control in the
club's 106-year history.
	   This is not just any team. Liverpool has won more league titles
(18) than any English rival and more European Champions Cups (4).
	   With about 170 non-English players on the 20 Premier League
teams when the season opened, Houllier's move leaves England's six
high-profile clubs without an English manager.
	   It's also the fourth management shakeup in the Premier League
this season _ again with foreigners figuring prominently.
	   Dutchman Ruud Gullit replaced Scotsman Kenny Dalglish at
Newcastle, Scot George Graham left Leeds to replace Swiss Christian
Gross at Tottenham, and David O'Leary replaced Graham at Leeds.
	   Liverpool chairman David Moores summed up the state of affairs
at Anfield.
	   ``It's a massive, massive club, the most successful club in
England, and we want to get it back to that state,'' he said.
	   As a concession to club history, Liverpool named former captain
Phil Thompson as assistant coach.
	   ``We don't want to go completely foreign,'' Moores said.
	   The marriage between Evans and Houllier didn't work, with
Liverpool lodged in 11th place and fresh from a humiliating loss
Tuesday to Tottenham 3-1 in the League Cup.
	   ``Maybe at one stage they (players) didn't know who was the boss
_ who they had to refer to,'' said Houllier, a former English
teacher dismissed as French national coach in 1993 when the side
missed the World Cup finals.
	   Schmeichel, who turns 35 next week, said he was quitting English
soccer at the end of the season because his body can't put up with
the daily grind. He said he hopes to continue his career in another
country _ French clubs Marseille and Monaco are possibilities.
	   ``I am enjoying the game as much as ever but it is getting
harder to keep pace,'' Schmeichel said. ``I need to train more than
I have ever had to. And in order to prepare myself properly, I need
more time between games than I can get in England.''
	   ``At the moment, I'm playing two games a week and it's very
difficult for me to get up to the standards you need to be at to
play for Manchester United.''
	   Regarded as one of the best 'keepers in the world, Schmeichel
joined United from Danish side Brondby in 1991 and was a key in
making United the most successful English club of the 1990s.
	   Capped a national-record 107 times for Denmark, Schmeichel has
been dogged by nagging injuries this season and his mistake in the
last minute of United's Champions League game against Bayern Munich
in September cost the club a victory.
	   Manchester United is rumored to want to replace him with another
foreigner, Aston Villa's Australian 'keeper Mark Bosnich.

Labor minister rebuffs economy talks with unions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANGUS SHAW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HARARE, Zimbabwe (AP) _ The government backed out of scheduled
talks on Thursday with unions intended to discuss economic policies
and worsening wages, prompting a vow by angry workers to continue
weekly work disruptions.
	   Labor Minister Nathan Shamuyarira, who failed to show up at the
talks, earlier accused the Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions of
treachery for organizing a strike while in the middle of the
existing talks on the economy.
	   The unions on Wednesday shut down vast sectors of production
throughout the country in the first of a series of one-day weekly
strikes.
	   Shamuyarira made no comment on why he did not attend Thursday's
meeting of the National Employment Council, a body of labor
leaders, employers and government officials that reviews wage
policies.
	   In a hardening of the conflict between government and workers,
Shamuyarira hinted that next Wednesday's strike could be banned. He
said the government was considering ``legal parameters to protect
the economy from those who want to ruin it by these stay-aways.''
	   Unrest over deteriorating economic conditions in the former
Rhodesia is posing the most serious threat to the government since
President Robert Mugabe's took over at Independence in 1980
	   A 67 percent hike in fuel prices last week triggered widespread
protests and violence around the capital of Harare.
	   Morgan Tsvangirai, secretary-general of the trade union
congress, said his group would continue with the weekly strikes
until the government agrees to meet with labor groups over wage and
price increases.
	   ``No one knows where this is going now. We are getting
rebuffed,'' Tsvangirai said.
	   But he said the government could avert next week's strike by
offering a ``dramatic change'' in its approach to negotiations.
	   The government also backed out of a meeting it called on
Wednesday with strike organizers.
	   The rapid return of business to normality on Thursday showed the
labor federation ``has the discipline and communications'' to shut
down the economy at will, according to Mike Auret, head of the
Roman Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace.
	   Auret said Thursday its branches around the country reported the
one-day strike was peaceful, although one rioter was killed in
protests in the eastern border city of Mutare.
	   Police fired tear gas and live ammunition to disperse
demonstrators in Mutare, where the rioter died.
	   The fuel price boost has pushed up prices of food and essential
goods by one third. The price of sugar rose by 20 percent on
Tuesday.
	   The labor federation accuses the government of economic
mismanagement, corruption and using resources badly needed at home
to deploy 6,000 Zimbabwe troops to support Congolese President
Laurent Kabila.

Istanbul city council elects new pro-Islamic mayor
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; RETRANSMITTING

<TEXT>
	   ISTANBUL, Turkey (AP) _ Istanbul's city council elected a
pro-Islamic mayor for Turkey's largest city on Thursday, just days
after his predecessor was ousted following his conviction for
inciting religious hatred.
	   Ali Mufit Gurtuna of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party won 111 of the
196 votes in the council. The election was another victory for the
Islamic movement, which secured the city for the first time in
1994.
	   Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the ex-mayor, was ousted Saturday after
his 10-month prison term was upheld by an appeals court. He was
convicted for reading a religious poem at a political rally.
	   Meanwhile, Ankara's pro-Islamic mayor was detained Thursday on
charges of tampering with municipal contracts worth some dlrs 240
million.
	   Police chief Cevdet Saral told reporters that Melih Gokcek was
being interrogated for allegedly favoring private companies said to
be linked to a pro-Islamic foundation in the bids.
	   Recai Kutan, leader of the pro-Islamic Virtue Party, strongly
condemned Gokcek's detention.
	   The leaders of Virtue, the largest party in parliament, face
numerous court cases on charges ranging from inciting religious
hatred to falsifying party records.
	   The cases are seen as an attempt by Turkey's secular
establishment to curtail the power of the Islamic movement.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Iraq's deputy prime minister on Thursday
accused President Clinton of blocking the lifting of U.N. sanctions
against his country.
	   ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally
by (Clinton's) government'' Aziz told reporters.
	   ``Who is blocking the way toward sincere cooperation? It's he
(Clinton) and his government, not the president of Iraq and the
government of Iraq,'' Aziz said.
	   Aziz said he referred to the United States' refusal to allow a
reference to lifting sanctions on Iraq in the U.N. proposal to
conduct a comprehensive review of Iraq's compliance with the demand
for it to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction.
	   He said this made ``a theatrical exercise ... a mockery'' of
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's offer for such a review as a
step toward lifting the sanctions imposed on Iraq after its 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   Aziz insisted Iraq had complied with U.N. resolutions. ``When
speaking of compliance, it's the United States that's not
complying,'' Aziz told a news conference.
	   ``If this crisis is going to escalate into an aggression, it's
their decision ... and it's not the responsibility of Iraq because
Iraq showed cooperation'' with U.N. inspectors charged with
verifying that Iraq has eliminated its weapons of mass destruction.
	   `` Who authorizes the United States to attack Iraq?'' Aziz asked
the reporters. ``Is that in U.N. resolutions? Is that in
international law? Iraq is not responsible for that.''
	   He also criticized chief U.N. inspector Richard Butler for
pulling out his monitors from Iraq without consulting Annan.
	   He said France and Russia _ Iraq's traditional allies _ and Arab
states supported the lifting of the sanctions even if they
disagreed with some of Iraq's tactics.
	   ``They might not agree fully about our tactics. That is natural.
Tactics is the choice of the government, but we do not disagree
about the substance,'' he said.
	   ``With all respect to those countries, I don't see any light at
the end of the tunnel. There is a tunnel after a tunnel. Each time
we cooperate and work with Butler and his group, a new tunnel is
being built after the first one,'' Aziz said.
	   Aziz spoke hours after a second batch of U.N. relief workers
left Iraq by bus.
	   U.N. humanitarian program spokesman Eric Falt said 25 workers
left instead of the 40 that officials had initially decided would
go. He did not elaborate. In addition, all 103 United Nations
weapons inspectors went to Bahrain by air on Wednesday.
	   About 295 humanitarian workers are now left in Iraq, mostly in
the Kurdish north that is unlikely to be targeted. Before Wednesday
the U.N. had 450 relief program staffers in Iraq.
	   Falt said all the 155 relief workers evacuated so far _ 130 left
Wednesday for Jordan's capital, Amman _ were based in the southern
and central Iraq.
	   The ruling Baath party newspaper, al-Thawra, in a front page
editorial, said the U.S. military preparations in the Gulf were
part of American ``psychological warfare.''
	   ``Iraq no longer pays attention to these empty threats,'' it
said and asserted that Iraq will not back down.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
response since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   With U.S. warships in the Gulf region and the Pentagon beginning
a major buildup of warplanes and troops, Clinton warned that
spurning U.N. demands for arms inspections would be a costly
mistake for Iraq.
	   Despite mounting military threats, Iraq showed no sign of
backing down from its refusal to allow the resumption of arms
inspections. Newspapers published a statement by the ruling Baath
party urging Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at
American interests in case of U.S. aggression.
	   Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride, and there
was little evidence of panic or people rushing to stock up on food.
	   Iraq says it will not resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors
unless the U.N. Security Council moves to begin lifting trade
sanctions.
	   But the council is bound by a resolution that will not allow the
lifting of sanctions until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
dismantled its nuclear program, biological and chemical weapons and
long range missiles.
	   The United Nations said in New York that Thursday's evacuation
would leave about 55 U.N. staff members in Baghdad and more than
230 in the north.
	   Among the U.N. people remaining are Prakash Shah, Annan's envoy
to Iraq, and Hans von Sponeck, the head of U.N. humanitarian
operations who took up his post in Iraq on Monday.
	   Von Sponeck said the evacuation would slow down but not end the
distribution of relief supplies in government-controlled areas.
	   ``Our capacity is much reduced,'' von Sponeck said. ``But
whatever capacity we have we will utilize for our humanitarian
program.''
	   The pullout is likely to halt the work of other specialized U.N.
agencies.

IMF rescue package could prompt new reduction in Brazil's interest
</HEADLINE>
rates &QL; 
 &UR; By STAN LEHMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ After lowering the key lending rate,
Brazil's government has turned its attention to a long-awaited
international rescue package that could prompt a further interest
rate cut to boost the sagging economy.
	   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee lowered the annual
interest rate Wednesday night from 49.75 percent to 42.25 percent.
	   Brazil nearly doubled its key lending rate in September to halt
the flight of investors after Russia's August devaluation raised
fears of emerging markets. The country's foreign reserves have
since fallen to around dlrs 43 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the
end of July.
	   Capital flight continues, although at a slower pace.
	   After posting a massive net outflow of dlrs 21 billion in
September and October, Brazil's exchange market have lost a slimmer
dlrs 66 million this month.
	   Commenting on interest rate reduction, Antonio Costa, a director
at a Sao Paulo-based asset management company said ``the central
bank played conservative because of a variety of pending factors.''
	   He cited congressional approval of fiscal austerity measures, a
reduction in capital flight and confirmation of an aid package from
international lenders as necessary precursors to larger rate cuts.
	   ``The reduction was a positive sign, but not enough to revive
economic activity,'' said Clarice Seibel, head of the Research and
Economic Studies Department of the Federation of Industries of the
State of Sao Paulo.
	   ``We expected the government to adopt a much more aggressive and
less conservative attitude,'' she said, adding that the federation
would prefer interest rates of 23 percent to 24 percent.
	   ``But the probable approval by Congress of the fiscal austerity
measures and the imminent agreement with the IMF should bring a
bigger interest rate cut in the future,'' she added.
	   Other analysts have predicted that the key lending rate could
drop to between 25 percent and 30 percent by the end of the year.
	   On Oct. 28, the government unveiled an austerity package,
combining new taxes and spending cuts to save dlrs 24 billion in
1999 and dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by
Congress.
	   The government hopes the measures will qualify Brazil for an IMF
rescue package, expected to be announced within the next few days.
	   The IMF has insisted on a tough plan to slash Brazil's deficit
before going ahead with an estimated dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40
billion aid program.
	   Analysts say the austerity measures are likely to aggravate the
country's economic slowdown and push unemployment above its current
official rate of 7.8 percent. Independent economists say
unemployment is closer to 20 percent.
	   ``The reduction in the key lending rate will unlikely change the
negative perspectives facing the retail sector,'' said Antonio
Carlos Borges, an economist of the Sao Paulo State Retailers
Federation. ``Consumers are scared of losing their jobs when the
austerity measures start being implemented.''

West African coalition battles rebels in Sierra Leone
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   FREETOWN, Sierra Leone (AP) _ A Nigerian-led intervention force
has clashed repeatedly with rebels over the past week in northern
Sierra Leone, leaving numerous people killed on both sides, a top
intervention force official said Thursday.
	   Brig. Gen. Abu Ahmadu did not indicate that the battles were
coordinated by either side, though Sierra Leonean newspapers say
rebels scored at least one major victory.
	   ``The past one week has been very eventful,'' said Ahmadu, the
Nigerian commander in Sierra Leone for the West African force known
as ECOMOG. ``We had quite a lot of losses during one week, so also
has the enemy.''
	   Ahmadu gave no casualty figures, but said there had been battles
over the past few days in the northern towns of Gbendembu and
Kamalo.
	   The Freetown-based newspaper For Di People said that the rebels
kidnapped three intervention force officers in Kamalo and that 20
soldiers may have been killed in a rebel ambush.
	   The Nigerian-led coalition force ousted Sierra Leone's ruling
military junta earlier this year and returned President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah to power.
	   Although Kabbah and the ECOMOG force are firmly in control of
the capital, former junta soldiers and their rebel allies still
control parts of the country and have been waging a terrorist
campaign against the civilian population.

	   BEIT EL, West Bank _ Rahamim Karo walked along the wire fence
outside his stone house Thursday and motioned toward the
Palestinian village just 100 meters (yards) away.
	   It's so close that on most mornings, Karo wakes up to the sound
of Palestinian school children singing their national anthem,
``Biladi, biladi.''
	   For now, the Israeli army is still in charge in the area. But
once Israel withdraws from West Bank land as part of the new peace
agreement, Palestinian police will deploy in the village and the
prospect is spooking many of Beit El's 5,000 residents.
	   On Thursday, one day after the Israeli Cabinet approved the
latest peace accord, the pulse of the settlers the day was a blend
of apprehension, defiance and defeat.
	   ``People feel this is another wave of adversity that we have to
make it through but we are probably not aware of just how big this
next wave will be,'' said Karo, 33, a janitor at a Beit El
elementary school.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and ruled over the lives of its Palestinian population until
the 1993 peace process began. Some 150,000 Israeli settlers and 1.6
million Arabs now live on the land that Palestinians want for a
future state.
	   When Israeli troops begin withdrawing from areas next week,
Palestinians there will gain more freedom of movement, will not be
subject to Israeli searches and troops will no longer be able to
enter their villages.
	   Karo and others including Helen Borer, a Manhattan native who
moved to Beit El 21 years ago and lives there with her eight
children, said they fear a reduced Israeli troop presence will lead
to everything from drive-by shootings, ambushes, stoning of cars
and attacks on property.
	   Borer said despite her concerns for the future, she will not
leave the settlement. And she dismissed defense ministry plans to
furbish the community with antitank ditches and video surveillance
systems.
	   ``You can't fight a battle by erecting another wall, another
moat. We are not living in the Middle Ages,'' Borer said, standing
in the rose garden of Beit El's Jewish seminary where she works as
a secretary.
	   A survey conducted by Modaein Ezrahi, an Israeli polling firm,
found that 41 percent of settlers oppose the Wye Accords. The poll,
which had a margin of error of 5 percentage points, surveyed 419
adults living in settlements all over the West Bank.
	   Rivka, a 36-year-old nurse who wore a traditional black head
scarf and like most religious Jewish women asked that her last name
not be used, said she came to Beit El as an idealistic teenager.
	   Today, however, she is less confidant of her mission.
	   ``I want to live in a Jewish state, not a Palestinian state,''
she said, ``I felt like I was serving Israel and now I feel like I
am a soldier left alone in the field.''

Rusedski joins Nestor in quarterfinals

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Rusedski's match; will be updated &QL;

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Britain's Greg Rusedski was broken for
the first time in the tournament, but held on for a relatively easy
6-1, 6-4 victory over American Vince Spadea in the Stockholm Open
Thursday.
	   The Briton's victory set up the first-ever quarterfinal between
two Canadian-born players in the tournament, one of the world's
oldest indoors.
	   Rusedski, the winningest indoor player this year with 31
victories, will face Daniel Nestor in Friday's quarterfinals.
	   Nestor, ranked 115th on the ATP Tour computer, eliminated Cedric
Pioline 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in Thursday's first second-round match at the
Royal Tennis Hall.
	   The sixth-seeded Frenchman's exit left only three of the eight
seeds remaining in the tournament.
	   Nestor's victory came less than 24 hours after Aussie Jason
Stoltenberg upset world top-ranked Pete Sampras in a first-round
match. Other seeded players who have lost include Slovakia's Karol
Kucera (2), defending champion Jonas Bjorkman (5) and former
two-time Stockholm Open winner Thomas Enqvist (8), both Swedes.
	   The fourth-seeded Rusedski, who beat Sampras in the Paris Open
final Sunday, reached the Stockholm Open semifinals last year.
	   ``But I'm just taking one step at a time,'' he said. ``I have a
difficult opponent tomorrow.''
	   Rusedski, who beat German Tommy Haas 6-1, 6-4 in his first match
Wednesday, was broken for the first time in the tournament at 3-3
in the second set when he hit a forehand volley wide.
	   Spadea led 40-15 in the next game, but Rusedski ralled and broke
back to lead 4-3. He then held serve the rest of the way to close
out the match in just over an hour after the American had saved
four match points in the last game.
	   Pioline, a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon finalist who is 16th
on the ATP Tour computer, failed to take advantage of five break
points when tied at 2-2 in the decisive set.
	   Nestor finally held, firing an ace past Pioline and then hitting
another good first serve that the Frenchman couldn't return.
	   Both players then held their serves, but Pioline fell behind
15-40 in the eighth game. Pioline saved the first break point. But
Nestor capitalized on a lucky net cord on the second when Pioline's
return sailed long.
	   Nestor, who was only broken once in the match, then closed out
the set and the match.
	   In later second-round matches, Stoltenberg played Hendrik
Dreekmann of Germany and American qualifier Geoff Grant faced
Thomas Johansson of Sweden.

Russian banker killed in St. Petersburg
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia (AP) _ A prominent banker in St.
Petersburg has been stabbed to death in his home, a newspaper
reported Thursday, the latest in a string of attacks against
influential figures in Russia's second-largest city.
	   The body of Igor Paramonov, deputy head of the St. Petersburg
Bank for Reconstruction and Development, was found Tuesday, but
police believe he had been killed several days before, the Smena
newspaper reported.
	   Paramonov shared a Soviet-era communal apartment, and his
neighbors alerted the police after the banker had not been seen
leaving his room for three days, the newspaper said. There are
still many communal apartments in St. Petersburg and other Russian
cities.
	   Investigators believe Paramonov was killed by an acquaintance
and that unlike other recent high-profile attacks in the city, the
killing was not related to the victim's work.
	   No additional details were immediately available.
	   Last month, a prominent St. Petersburg businessman, Dmitry
Filipov, was killed in a bomb explosion. Earlier, an aide to the
speaker of Russian parliament was shot in the head by an
unidentified gunman and seriously injured.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel angered Palestinians Thursday by giving
the go-ahead for construction of a Jewish housing project in a
disputed area of Jerusalem, but also pledged to begin turning over
West Bank territory next week.
	   Dennis Ross, the United States special Middle East envoy, is to
arrive Friday in Israel to oversee implementation of the nascent
Mideast land-for-security accord, and Palestinian officials were
already calling on him to help solve the latest disputes.
	   ``It is now crucial to have the American side join us ... to
oversee implementation of the agreement, '' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   He told The Associated Press, ``We will not accept any
post-agreement negotiations and will not accept any conditions
outside,'' the accord itself, signed at the White House Oct. 26.
	   Under the accord narrowly ratified Wednesday by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet, Israel is to carry out a staged troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security measures.
	   Israel's plans to hand over the first parcel of land next week,
said David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu. And there were
signs on the ground Thursday that implementation of some aspects
was close.
	   At the Palestinian airport in Gaza, near the Egyptian border,
Israeli and Palestinian officials drilled security procedures for
checking passengers.
	   Israeli soldiers were seen pulling equipment out of an army base
in the West Bank, near the Palestinian village of Dura. It was not
clear if the base is to be evacuated as part of the Israeli
redeployment.
	   However, Palestinians focused attention on Israel's decision to
accept bids for construction at a Jerusalem hilltop Israelis call
Har Homa and Palestinians know as Jabal Abu Ghneim. The hilltop is
part of land Israel captured from Jordan and annexed after the 1967
Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a
future state in the area.
	   Ground-breaking there in January, 1997 for the 6,000 homes
planned for Jews, led to Palestinian rioting and a 19-month
stalemate in negotiations broken after Netanyahu and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat signed the latest peace deal. Netanyahu has
promised repeatedly the new homes would be ready there in 2000.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an aide to Arafat, called the project and a
series of new Israeli conditions on the peace accord ``a violation
of the ... agreement and of all agreements.''
	   On Wednesday, Netanyahu warned that if the Palestinians go
through with a plan to unilaterally declare independence when the
interim peace accords expire in May, Israel will annex all West
Bank territory it still controls.
	   Arafat left the issue open, saying the issue of statehood could
be negotiated.
	   ``May 4 is the end of the five-year period we agreed upon in
Oslo,'' Arafat was quoted as saying. ``If there are other ideas,
I'm ready to listen.''

Olympic gymnastics champ turns 100

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Stukelj, Samaranch remarks, edits to conform &QL; 
 &UR; By ALI H. ZERDIN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GRAD OTOCEC, Slovenia (AP) _ Six-time gymnastics medalist Leon
Stukelj, the oldest living Olympian, turned 100 in style Thursday
with celebratory events across Slovenia and a visit from the head
of the Olympic movement.
	   ``When I woke up this morning, I realized that I'm 100 now, and
I thought about it for a while,'' a jovial Stukelj told reporters.
``Then I realized that I'm doing just fine and I'm glad I could
come here to be with you.''
	   Juan Antonio Samaranch, chief of the International Olympic
Committee, was the first guest of honor at Stukelj's birthday gala.
	   He commended not only Stukelj's sports victories, but his
life-long contributions to his community. ``Most importantly, Mr.
Stukelj is a real gentleman: he's honoring sports, his country and
the Olympic movement.''
	   Because of a cold, Stukelj missed the opening in his hometown of
Maribor of an exhibition of rewards and photos that he collected
through years.
	   But he did appear later in Grad Otocec, a picturesque city on an
island in the Krka river, where the Slovene government arranged a
birthday luncheon for him and his guests.
	   Asked whether he would prefer to celebrate with his family
alone, Stukelj replied: ``My age is really something exceptional.
And you know, I have that problem that I'm the owner of three
Olympic gold medals.''
	   He recalled his seventh birthday, when he wished to become a
gymnast.
	   His wish came true.
	   Stukelj won Olympic golds in the horizontal bar and all-around
competition at Paris in 1924, which he said Thursday had been the
most important thing in his life. He won another gold in the rings
at Amsterdam in 1928. He also won two bronze medals at Amsterdam,
in the all-around and team exercises, and a silver in the rings at
Berlin in 1936.
	   He was so good that one of his trademark moves is still known as
the Stukelj maneuver.
	   Stukelj went on to work as a judge and also wrote books on
gymnastics. He remains involved in Slovenia's sports life, and has
kept up his health by working out on rings in his apartment and by
taking hour-long walks in a a nearby park.
	   Samaranch, who gave Stukelj a silver cup on behalf of the
Olympic committee, invited Stukelj to come to the 2000 Olympic
Games in Sydney. Stukelj was present at the Atlanta Games in 1996.
	   To show further appreciation, Samaranch suggested that Stukelj,
should present medals to gymnasts in Sydney.
	   ``I do not know in what condition I'd be in 2000,'' Stukelj, who
would then be 102, said. ``When 2000 comes, we'll talk again.''
	   Later, a ceremony was planned on the main square in Novo Mesto,
where Stukelj was born in 1898. A gala gymnastic event was
scheduled in his honor in the city's sports hall afterward.

<TEXT>
	   Here are excerpts from editorials in publications in various
countries:
	   -0-
	   Neue Zuercher Zeitung, Zurich, Switzerland, on Newt Gingrich:
	   By abruptly announcing his resignation, House of Representatives
Speaker Newt Gingrich has accepted the consequences of a failed
election strategy but also cleared the way for a new direction for
his party.
	   His resignation in itself is a good sign.
	   It shows that not every politician clings on to office
regardless of the consequences, and that aims other than political
power are worth striving for.
	   Whoever succeeds him won't have the polarizing charisma and
wealth of ideas of the ``revolutionary'' from Georgia.
	   Gingrich was more than just a speaker: he largely shaped
Republican politics after the Reagan-Bush era. ...
	   With his always talkative and sometimes even verbose media
presence, he was President Clinton's opposite on the political
scene.
	   But Gingrich's four years as speaker brought anything but a
series of successes for the Republicans.
	   The rebel wasn't always a prudent king. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   De Volkskrant, Amsterdam, Netherlands, on Newt Gingrich:
	   Gingrich's departure marks the end of the offensive launched by
the Republicans four years ago. For the Grand Old Party, malaise
has now replaced euphoria.
	   The Republicans in Congress will miss Gingrich's expertise. It
is unlikely that his successor will have enough authority to fill
the gap and develop a coherent program.
	   That means President Bill Clinton and the Democrats will get
more latitude in the coming days when it comes to lawmaking. The
Republicans will have to look for new leadership outside of
Congress, and that increases the chance for the successful Bush
brothers to steer their party back to the political middle. But
that could be preceded by an interim with many bloody heads.
	    &UR; ___
	   Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on U.S. midterm elections:
	   In this election ... it is difficult to analyze the political
implications on the narrow basis of the number of successful
candidates in each party.
	   Still, Clinton cannot afford to be complacent. The fact that
voters chose the status quo is tacit criticism of both Democrats
and Republicans for having failed to offer any appealing visions
for change.
	   Even though the momentum for presidential impeachment is waning,
the next two years will be difficult for Clinton, both in domestic
and foreign policy. The Republicans, who got both of George Bush's
sons into the gubernatorial posts in the big states of Texas and
Florida, already have their sights set on the next presidential
election two years ahead. The Republicans can be expected to be
even more confrontational about spurring an economy that has begun
to show signs of slowing, about policy in the potentially explosive
Middle East, and over security in the Korean Peninsula.
	   We hope the U.S. Congress will demonstrate stable leadership
through constructive debate, rather than using international issues
as a political football.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sun, London, on Armistice Day:
	   The 11th hour of the 11th day of the 11th month. That is when,
80 years ago today, the guns of World War One fell silent.
	   On this somber anniversary, we all should fall silent, too.
	   The two minutes' silence at 11 o'clock _ reinstated three years
ago after a Sun campaign _ is a time to honor those who died for
their country.
	   Not just those who fell in the so-called `war to end all wars'
but those killed in World War II, Korea, Suez, Aden, Northern
Ireland, the Falklands, the Gulf and other theaters of war.
	   We enjoy liberty and peace today because they sacrificed their
tomorrows.
	   Two minutes is so little to give in honor of those who gave so
much.
	    &UR; ___
	   Le Monde, Paris, on 80th anniversary of the World War I
armistice:
	   If Europe wants to affirm its existence and its identity in the
21st century, it must not forget the history of countries once
linked to its own. The BBC honored on Wednesday the men in the
Indian Army who died in the trenches (of World War I).
	   France wanted to honor Abdoulaye Ndiaye, 104, the last survivor
of the Senagalese infantry men who distinguished themselves on the
fronts from 1914 to 1918. Ndiaye died Tuesday, the evening before
he was to be decorated with the Legion of Honor. But the blood debt
is there, and France owes a debt to Africa, to Ndiaye's children
and grandchildren, in Senegal, but also to his children here in
France, without identity papers, in the streets of our cities.
	   Europe must not re-create itself by shutting the rest of the
world out, nor by forgetting what it owes to the world.

	   BEIT EL, West Bank _ Rahamim Karo walked along the wire fence
outside his stone house Thursday and motioned toward the
Palestinian village just 100 meters (yards) away.
	   It's so close that on most mornings, Karo wakes up to the sound
of Palestinian school children singing their national anthem,
``Biladi, biladi.''
	   For now, the Israeli army is still in charge in the area. But
once Israel withdraws from West Bank land as part of the new peace
agreement, Palestinian police will deploy in the village and the
prospect is spooking many of Beit El's 5,000 residents.
	   On Thursday, one day after the Israeli Cabinet approved the
latest peace accord, the pulse of the settlers the day was a blend
of apprehension, defiance and defeat.
	   ``People feel this is another wave of adversity that we have to
make it through but we are probably not aware of just how big this
next wave will be,'' said Karo, 33, a janitor at a Beit El
elementary school.
	   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Mideast
war and ruled over the lives of its Palestinian population until
the 1993 peace process began. Some 150,000 Israeli settlers and 1.6
million Arabs now live on the land that Palestinians want for a
future state.
	   When Israeli troops begin withdrawing from areas next week,
Palestinians there will gain more freedom of movement, will not be
subject to Israeli searches and troops will no longer be able to
enter their villages.
	   Karo and others including Helen Borer, a Manhattan native who
moved to Beit El 21 years ago and lives there with her eight
children, said they fear a reduced Israeli troop presence will lead
to everything from drive-by shootings, ambushes, stoning of cars
and attacks on property.
	   Borer said despite her concerns for the future, she will not
leave the settlement. And she dismissed defense ministry plans to
furbish the community with antitank ditches and video surveillance
systems.
	   ``You can't fight a battle by erecting another wall, another
moat. We are not living in the Middle Ages,'' Borer said, standing
in the rose garden of Beit El's Jewish seminary where she works as
a secretary.
	   A survey conducted by Modaein Ezrahi, an Israeli polling firm,
found that 41 percent of settlers oppose the Wye Accords. The poll,
which had a margin of error of 5 percentage points, last week
surveyed 419 adults living in settlements all over the West Bank.

	   La Repubblica, Rome, on U.S.-Iraq standoff:
	   Punctual and predictable Saddam Hussein has war prospects in
mind again. ... This time, however, he faces a different (President
Bill) Clinton from the one in August.
	   Clinton is now a very strong opponent. He's no longer suspected
of trying to downplay the (Monica Lewinsky) scandal by launching
military operations. Instead, he has renewed his impeccable
credentials as peacemaker between the Palestinians and the
Israelis.
	   Now he intends to settle the bill left by (former President
George) Bush who ordered victorious Gulf troops to end fighting,
thus leaving Saddam's ambitions and repressive army intact.
	   Everything indicates that, this time, Saddam will not get away
with a compromise at the eleventh hour.
	   The Saudis are behind Clinton on their path towards
reconciliation with the West as is Europe, led by leftist
governments that don't want to appear disloyal and hesitant at the
first ordeal by fire. Faced with Clinton's wrath, Saddam has
nothing to protect his people from the consequences of his still
more atrocious and hopeless ``bluffs.''
	    &UR; ___
	   Buenos Aires Herald, on global warming:
	   Not everybody ... may be aware of the 4th United Nations Climate
Change Conference unfolding here this month. ... The main aim is to
line up the world behind implementing last year's Kyoto Agreement,
which commits countries to reducing their 1990 toxic gas emissions
(especially carbon dioxide) by the very precise figure of 5.2
percent by the year 2010.
	   Opinions on this differ, as might be fully expected from a
conclave drawing 3,000-4,000 people from 174 countries.
Underdeveloped countries blame the more industrialized and would
like to make them pay ... while industrial leaders argue that
exempting the least developed countries would only encourage
industries to migrate to them. ... Perhaps environmental zeal
should simply focus on seeking alternative sources of energy to
fossil fuels.
	    &UR; ___
	   The Sun News, Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, on leaders'
indiscretions:
	   The majority of voters ... did not seem to care whether
President Clinton had a sexual affair with a White House intern.
They certainly did not vote to defeat his supporters.
	   And that may mean they and historians really do not care that
one of our nation's revered forefathers, Thomas Jefferson, fathered
at least one illegitimate child with a slave in his household. To
be sure, Jefferson's indiscretion came after his wife's death and
in Paris, where he was an ambassador after being president, not
while he was married and in Washington.
	   It turns out Jefferson's affair with Sally Hemings was proved by
a most modern technique called DNA matching. That is sort of like a
whole-body fingerprint.
	   But what difference does Jefferson's illegitimate child make?
Does it make him less a founder of this nation? We think not. It
means most that he, like most heroes, was quite human.
	    &UR; ___
	   Seattle Post-Intelligencer, on China's one-child policy:
	   Indications are that China is relaxing, ever so tentatively, its
One Child Policy. That is most encouraging: The dehumanizing
standard didn't jibe with the image of the progressive nation that
China professes to be. ...
	   Such steps forward are extremely welcome, be they due to the
recognition that increasingly Western-oriented Chinese women were
fed up with totalitarian tactics or the simple acknowledgement that
there are more workable options to curtail population growth.
	   Recognized options include family planning education on a mass
scale, providing a variety of free contraceptive methods or the
least attractive alternative, taxes on couples who choose to add
children to their families.
	   Draconian as the implementation was, the One Child Policy did
succeed in its goal. Two decades later, the average number of
children has declined from almost six to about two per woman of
child-bearing age. That's no small change in a country which, with
1.26 billion people, represents about 22 percent of the global
village. ...
	    &UR; ___
	   The Oregonian, Portland, Oregon, on Newt Gingrich:
	   Maybe the strangest aspect of Newt Gingrich's decision to give
up his speakership and seat in the U.S. House of Representatives
was Bill Clinton's reaction.
	   Clinton issued a statement praising Gingrich as a worthy
adversary.
	   This was praise for the man who oversaw a year of dragging the
nation through the mud, coming from the man who created the mud. If
you ever needed a demonstration that impeachment is a political
process, not a judicial one, the events surrounding Gingrich's
announcement offered it.
	   You'll recall that impeachment _ of Bill Clinton, not Newt
Gingrich _ is where all of this started.
	   The turmoil following Gingrich's announcement doesn't bode well
for organizing the next Congress. Gingrich's leadership style
caused many of his lieutenants to chafe, but it kept a lid on their
animosities. Now the lid is off.
	   Gingrich's decision is not the best thing that could have
happened to the country right now, either. It diminishes the
prospect of some sort of rational conclusion to the House's
impeachment inquiry. ...

Kuwait retains Gulf championship by beating Emirates 4-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Kuwait beat the United Arab Emirates 4-1
on Thursday to retain the Gulf championship.
	   It was the ninth time Kuwait had won the biennial championship.
	   In the day's second match, host Bahrain drew 2-2 with Oman in
the last match of the six-nation tournament that began on Oct 30.
	   Kuwait, which dominated the game until the final whistle, scored
their first goal in the 16th minute with a penalty by striker Badr
Hajji.
	   Their second came in the 38th minute with a left-footed sweep
kick by forward Essam Sikeen from almost 18 yards (16 meters).
	   However, Kuwait's real hero was forward Jassim al-Huwaidy, who
scored the two second half goals in the 64th and 70th minutes to
assure his country of the title.
	   Thursday's win put Kuwait ahead in the standings with 12 points.
Second-placed Saudi Arabia, who were favorites to lift the cup,
missed their chance when they drew 0-0 with Qatar on Wednesday.
	   In Thursday's match, Emirates were set back in the 23rd minute
by a red card to key player Adil Mattar.
	   Emirates came close to scoring several goals, but they managed
only one in the 55th minute when midfielder Hassan Sohail delivered
a neat header.
	   Mohammed Aziz kicked an aimless penalty shot which was easily
stopped by Kuwait's keeper. The miss seemed to dash the hopes of
Emirates' players and they never recovered.

Ivanisevic-Burgsmuller match. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Arnaud Clement of France and Croatia's Goran
Ivanisevic advanced to the semifinals of the dlrs 1.1 million
Kremlin Cup in Moscow on Thursday.
	   Ivanisevic, who beat German qualifier Lars Burgsmuller 6-2, 6-1,
said that even if he continues to win and qualifies for the ATP
Tour Championship, he won't go to Hanover, Germany because of a
shoulder injury.
	   ``This is the last tournament for me, and I want to finish the
year in a good way,'' he told reporters. ``It would be nice to win
here. ... But whatever I do, I'm not going to Hanover.''
	   Ivanisevic, 1996 Kremlin Cup champion, fired 12 aces and allowed
the 22-year-old Burgsmuller only one break point _ in the first
game of the second set.
	   Clement beat Canada's Sebastien Lareau 6-3, 7-5 to reach his
first ATP Tour semifinal. Twenty-year-old Clement held his serve
and didn't allow Lareau a single break point.
	   Lareau, a Canadian doubles specialist, wasn't serving as
consistently as he did Wednesday _ when he upset top-seeded Alex
Corretja _ and he double-faulted six times.
	   Clement broke the Canadian in the eighth game of the first set
and went to deuce in the 12th game of the second before blasting an
ace to win the match.
	   ``When I came here I didn't expect to reach the semifinals,''
Clement said.

Croatian, international officials in formerly Serb-held area
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VUKOVAR, Croatia (AP) _ Croatian officials appealed to Western
governments on Thursday to help finance reconstruction of the
war-torn, formerly Serb-held region of Eastern Slavonia.
	   Both Croatian and international officials gathered in this still
ruined regional center to mark the third anniversary of the Erdut
agreement, which envisaged peaceful return of the region to
Croatian rule, after Serbs controlled Eastern Slavonia since the
1991 war.
	   The area was transferred back to Croatia on Jan. 15 and the last
United Nations forces, which supervised the transition, withdrew
last month.
	   But although the transfer of power was largely peaceful,
thousands of Serbs have left the area, fearing or already facing
revenge from returning Croats, who were expelled from here in 1991.
Croats are also slowly coming back to the devastated area.
	   The U.N. Security Council has repeatedly expressed concern about
Croatia's commitment to grant full rights and protection to ethnic
Serbs who stayed behind.
	   Some ethnic-motivated incidents have nevertheless been recorded
in the area and local Serbs complain that Croatian police are not
protecting them.
	   Vesna Skare Ozbolt, an aide to President Franjo Tudjman, said
Croatia is doing its best to establish peace and co-existence in
Eastern Slavonia. She added that up to dlrs 2.5 billion would be
needed to reconstruct regional houses and factories destroyed in
the war, which would help bring stability to the area.
	   Croatia is organizing a donors conference on Dec. 4-5, hoping to
gather the necessary reconstruction funds.
	   ``We expect real help from the international community,'' Ozbolt
said.
	   U.S. ambassador to Croatia, William Dale Montgomery, said the
region needed economic revival, but he emphasized that
``intolerance and discrimination, as a war legacy, should cease to
exist.''
	   Tim Guldimann, who heads Croatian mission of the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which now supervises
Eastern Slavonia, said that the real peace ``can only be achieved
if people believe in their joint future.''

Foreign investment in Russia down by half this year
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russian officials expect foreign investment this
year to drop 49 percent from last year, largely because of economic
and political turmoil since this summer, a news report said
Thursday.
	   Russia will likely attract dlrs 3 billion in overall foreign
investments in 1998, down 49 percent from dlrs 6.1 billion in 1997,
the Interfax news agency cited Russian Deputy Economics Minister
Vladimir Kossov as saying.
	   Kossov attributed the drop to foreign investors' wariness of
economic and political uncertainty following a shaky summer on
Russia's markets, and the government's decision in August to
devalue the ruble and default on some debts.
	   Kossov didn't say how much of this year's expected foreign
capital inflow would be in the form of direct investment. In 1997,
foreigners invested dlrs 4 billion directly in Russian enterprises,
and spent dlrs 2.1 billion Russian stocks and other securities, he
said.
	   If Russia wants to attract foreign investors, it has to secure
its political stability, overhaul its complex tax system and
improve its legal system, Kossov said.

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The British Embassy denied
Thursday a report published by an important Argentine newspaper
that the two nations are negotiating an agreement for the creation
of a new advisory council in the Falkland Islands, with British and
Argentine representation.
	   The front-page story in La Nacion also implied that the
Argentine flag would be flown in four locations in the Falkland
Islands, South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands.
	   ``These statements and implications are false. The British and
Argentine Governments are not negotiating on these issues,'' said a
communique from the embassy.
	   The Embassy also reminded that Prime Minister Tony Blair and
Britain consider the Falkland's sovereignty not negotiable. ``There
will be no change in the status of the Falkland Islands unless that
is the wish of the Islanders,'' the communique added.
	   It also said that ``British and Argentine officials are however
in continuing contact with each other on a range of South Atlantic
matters.''

Unlikely hero in Pakistan Squash Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Unseeded 18-year-old Amjad Khan
maintained a highly prized Pakistan tradition Thursday by coming
out of obscurity to win the Pakistan squash open at Karachi.
	   The Peshawar teenager, ranked No. 24 in the world, beat Canada's
sixth-seed Graham Ryding 15-8, 11-15, 15-9, 13-15, 15-8 in the
final to maintain a Pakistani stranglehold on the tournament.
	   The name Khan is nothing new to the Pakistan Open trophy, with
Amjad's uncle and former World No. 1 Jansher Khan winning six times
since 1987. Jahinger Khan, Jansher's predecessor as World No. 1,
has also won the event six times since 1984.
	   With Jansher electing not to defend his title, Pakistan squash
supporters feared the title could have fallen into foreign hands
for the first time since the Open's inception.
	   But Amjad Khan, winner at the CAS International two weeks ago,
was the unlikely hero.
	   The dlrs 50,000 Pakistan Open field included eight of the
world's top 20 players.

the new head of the Venice Film Festival, the ANSA news agency
reported.
	   Barbera replaces Felice Laudadio, who turned in a surprise
resignation at the end of this year's festival, saying he was tired
of movie competitions. Laudadio ran the festival for two years.
	   Barbera, 48, is a native of Turin who has written on film for
numerous Italian publications. He also worked closely with several
other Italian film festivals, ANSA said.
	   His publications include works on the films of directors Alfred
Hitchcock, Francois Truffaut and Erich von Stroheim.

Kuwait retains title with 4-1 victory over Emirates
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) _ Kuwait won its ninth Gulf Cup on
Thursday, getting two second-half goals from Jassim al-Huwaidy six
minutes apart in a 4-1 victory over the United Arab Emirates.
	   The victory finished Kuwait with a 4-0-1 record and 12 points,
one better than Saudi Arabia, which lost its chance to claim the
title on Wednesday when it drew 0-0 with Qatar.
	   In the day's other match, host Bahrain drew 2-2 with Oman to
avoid finishing in last place in the six-nation tournament.
	   Kuwait dominated throughout and took the lead in the 16th minute
on a penalty by striker Badr Hajji.
	   Adil Mattar sunk the Emirates further by getting expelled in the
23rd minute and Essam Sikeen took advantage seven minutes before
halftime from the top of the penalty area.
	   The Emirates produced several chances but only managed to score
in the 55th minute when midfielder Hassan Sohail converted a
header.
	   Mohammed Aziz kicked an aimless penalty that was easily stopped
by Kuwait's keeper, a missed opportunity that seemed to squeeze the
hopes of the Emirates.
	   Al-Huwaidy then sealed the victory with his pair in the 64th and
70th minutes.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ A second group of U.N. relief workers left
Iraq Thursday, and Arab ministers warned that Iraq alone would be
responsible for the consequences of halting U.N. weapons
inspections.
	   Meanwhile, Iraq's deputy prime minister accused U.S. President
Bill Clinton of blocking the lifting of U.N. sanctions against his
country.
	   ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally
by (Clinton's) government,'' Tariq Aziz told reporters in Baghdad.
	   U.N. humanitarian program spokesman Eric Falt said 25 workers
left instead of the 40 that officials initially decided would go.
He did not elaborate. Another 130 left Wednesday for Amman, Jordan,
the same day all 103 U.N. weapons inspectors flew to Bahrain.
	   About 295 humanitarian workers remain in Iraq, mostly in the
Kurdish north, which is unlikely to be targeted. All relief workers
thus far evacuated have been based in southern and central Iraq,
Falt said.
	   The United States and Britain have been threatening a military
response since Iraq announced Oct. 31 that it was halting the
activities of the U.N. Special Commission, known as UNSCOM, which
is responsible for eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction.
	   On Thursday, Arab foreign ministers held Iraq responsible for
the consequences of refusing to cooperate with the inspectors.
	   The statement by foreign ministers of eight Arab nations
appeared to be a warning to Iraq that it should not count on Arab
support in its dispute with the United Nations.
	   The statement made no mention of the United States or any
possible military action against Iraq, but expressed hope that
``wisdom and restraint prevail so that the United Nations can reach
a solution to the crisis.''
	   Aziz dismissed the statement, saying the Arab ministers should
blame the United States, not Iraq. ``We are sincere in dealing with
this situation,'' he said.
	   A major buildup of warplanes and troops in the Gulf continued
Thursday. Five U.S. Navy warships, including an aircraft carrier
and a submarine, are scheduled to cross the Suez Canal next week on
their way to the gulf, canal officials said Thursday.
	   There are already 23,400 U.S. troops in the Gulf in addition to
174 aircraft, 21 ships and nine vessels armed with Tomahawk
missiles, according to the Pentagon.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on Thursday urged the United
States to exercise restraint and avoid striking at Iraq, a move the
Palestinian leader said would be detrimental to Mideast peace.
	   U.N. chief Kofi Annan plans to meet with the U.N. Security
Council Friday but has no plans to fly to Baghdad to mediate in the
Iraq crisis, a spokesman said Thursday.
	   Despite mounting military threats, Iraq showed no sign of
letting U.N. arms inspections resume. Official Iraqi newspapers
published a statement Thursday by the ruling Baath party urging
Arab nations to rally behind Iraq and strike at American interests
in case of U.S. aggression.
	   In a front-page editorial, the Baath party newspaper al-Thawra
said the U.S. military preparations in the Gulf were part of
American ``psychological warfare.''
	   ``Iraq no longer pays attention to these empty threats,'' it
said, asserting that Iraq will not back down.
	   The official al-Qadissiya newspaper said President Saddam
Hussein's Cabinet discussed the crisis Wednesday. Iraq's five
official dailies published pictures of Saddam meeting ministers and
senior military commanders to discuss a response to ``American and
Zionist aggression.''
	   Iraqis appeared to be taking the situation in stride, and there
was little evidence of panic or people rushing to stockpile food.
	   Clinton has warned that spurning U.N. demands for arms
inspections would be a costly mistake for Iraq. The Security
Council has backed Annan's call to Saddam to immediately resume
cooperation with the inspectors.
	   Iraq says it will not do so unless the council moves to begin
lifting trade sanctions imposed to punish Iraq for its 1990
invasion of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War.
	   But the council is bound by a resolution that will not allow the
lifting of sanctions until UNSCOM certifies that Iraq has
dismantled its nuclear program, biological and chemical weapons and
long-range missiles.
	   The sanctions have contributed to Iraq's economic devastation.
Recognizing the plight of the Iraqis, the United Nations has let
Iraq sell limited quantities of crude oil to buy food and medicine
for its 22 million people.
	   The pullout is likely to halt the work of other specialized
agencies such as the U.N. Children's Fund, the U.N. Development
Program and the World Health Organization.
	   The official Iraqi News Agency reported that Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz had sent a letter to Annan complaining about
the withdrawal of the weapons inspectors, saying that UNSCOM was
following U.S. orders and using the United Nations as ``false
cover.''

Serb Orthodox Church blames Kosovo clashes on Albanian separatists
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The Serb Orthodox Church, which
considers Kosovo its cradle, blamed the Kosovo conflict on ethnic
Albanian separatists and demanded international protection for more
than 1,000 monuments in the Serbian province.
	   In a statement issued after a three-day meeting of the Holy
Synod, the church said that ``in recent history, the Serbian
Orthodox Church and the Serb people have never been in a tougher
position than now.''
	   ``Not only future status of Kosovo is being decided but also the
survival of orthodox Serbs and our church on that ancestral Serb
land,'' the statement said expressing ``regrets for bloodshed and
suffering of all in Kosovo.''
	   But the Holy Synod condemned the ``terror of Albanian separatism
and expansionism which has led to enormous crimes and suffering of
Serbs and many Albanians,'' Fonet news agency reported. It made no
mention of the decade-long state repression of Kosovo's ethnic
Albanian majority.
	   The Synod further demanded that it took part in the on-going
talks on future of Kosovo and praised an Oct. 12 agreement on the
province calling it ``an instrument of peace.''
	   The Synod called for ``international guarantees'' for protection
of some 1,300 Orthodox monuments in Kosovo, many of highest
historical and cultural value. The Serb Orthodox Church said its
units in Kosovo should gain self-rule ``the same as other important
religious centers have in the world.''

Secretary-general has no plans to mediate Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan plans to
meet with the U.N. Security Council on Friday but has no plans to
fly to Baghdad to mediate in the latest Iraq crisis, a U.N.
spokesman said.
	   ``He does not at this time see a possible role for himself,''
spokesman Fred Eckhard said Thursday. ``That's not to say he would
not be available if the council asked him to do something. But at
the moment he has no plans to go to Baghdad.''
	   Annan, who cut short a trip through north Africa, was returning
to New York later Thursday ``to get fully acquainted with the
situation'' and will meet with the Security Council on Friday
afternoon, Eckhard said. ``At this time he's coming back to
listen.''
	   The secretary-general flew to Baghdad during the last Iraqi
crisis in February and signed a memorandum of understanding with
Baghdad to allow unfettered weapons inspections that averted U.S.
and British airstrikes.
	   In the current crisis, he has supported the Security Council's
demand that Baghdad resume cooperation with U.N. inspectors
checking Iraq for weapons of mass destruction.
	   Iraq halted cooperation Oct. 31, and says it would resume
cooperation only if the Security Council begins to lift economic
sanctions imposed after Iraqi forces invaded Kuwait in 1990,
sparking the Gulf War. The sanctions are supposed to be lifted only
after the Security Council confirms that Iraq has met conditions
including the elimination of its weapons of mass destruction.
	   Annan appealed to Iraqi President Saddam Hussein on Wednesday to
resume cooperation immediately, and the council strongly supported
his appeal in a statement Wednesday evening.
	   ``The ball is in the Iraqi court to come back into compliance,''
U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current council
president, reiterated Thursday.
	   ``The responsibility is not the secretary-general's, and not the
Security Council's at this point. Both the Security Council and the
secretary-general have made their views crystal clear and what
everyone is waiting for is for the Iraqis to come back into
compliance and rescind their decisions.''
	   Eckhard was asked under what conditions Annan might be prepared
to go to Iraq.
	   ``I think first he'd want an indication from the Iraqis that
they're prepared to return to full compliance, and he would want
the support of the council that they would like him to mediate,''
Eckhard responded.
	   At the moment, however, Eckhard said there is no movement.
	   Asked what was the difference between the situation in Iraq in
February and today, Eckhard explained that in February Iraq had let
it be known through Middle East leaders ``that they were ready to
compromise and the council indicated that under the right
conditions they might be prepared to compromise.''
	   ``He met on four separate occasions with members of the council
to establish among them a consensus position on what he could
discuss with the Iraqis if he went. So he went with clear, although
narrow parameters of what he could discuss with the Iraqis. And he
went with an indication from the Iraqi side that they were ready to
talk. And I don't think he's got those two conditions today,''
Eckhard said.

American pulls out of Chase Championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ American Venus Williams has withdrawn from next
week's Chase Championships because of a recurring right knee
problem, the Corel WTA Tour announced Thursday.
	   Williams, had been receiving daily treatment on the knee, which
she strained earlier in the year. Listed fifth on the tour's
computer rankings, she would have been making her first appearance
in the season-ending dlrs 2 million Chase Championships at Madison
Square Garden.
	   ``I would have loved to have been able to play the Chase this
year,'' Williams said in a statement. ``Unfortunately, it's not
possible because I am not in the best possible condition.''
	   Monica Seles moved up to the No. 5 seeding, followed, in order,
by Frenchwoman Mary Pierce, Conchita Martinez of Spain and Nathalie
Tauziat of France. American Lindsay Davenport is the No. 1 seed,
followed by Swiss Martina Hingis, Czech Jana Novotna and Spaniard
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario.

Portuguese authorities probe alleged racist propaganda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ Portugal's attorney general opened an
investigation Thursday into a shadowy far-right organization called
``White Pride'' for allegedly producing racist propaganda, which is
banned.
	   A spokeswoman for the Attorney-General said the probe would
focus on racist stickers placed on Lisbon buildings and a telephone
line to a recorded message that allegedly promotes racist views.
	   The Constitution forbids racist or fascist organizations. The
penal code stipulates jails sentences of between six months and
eight years for ``propaganda that incites or encourages racial
discrimination, hate or violence.''
	   A sticker giving a cellphone number urges people to phone ``and
listen to the message defending honor, race and loyalty.''
	   The 4 1/2-minute recorded message, spoken by a male voice but
with no identification, warns against a ``silent invasion'' of
Portugal by African immigrants.
	   Thousands of blacks from Portugal's five former African colonies
_ Angola, Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and the
dual-island nation of Sao Tome and Principe _ live in the country.
	   ``Portugal is coming to be not for the Portuguese but simply an
extension of the African continent,'' the message says.
	   A spokeswoman for SOS Racism, an antiracism group, said ``White
Pride'' is a murky underground group with some 500 members.
	   Anizabela Amaral claimed there was a growing threat in Portugal
from racist groups, saying there were now about 20.
	   ``What is happening in Portugal is like a volcano about to
erupt,'' Amaral said.
	   The European Commission against Racism and Intolerance, part of
the Council of Europe, said in a June 1998 report on racism in
Europe that Portugal ``is a generally tolerant country with good,
specific laws to combat racism and discrimination.''
	   However, it warned that ``more attention should be paid ... to
the situation of illegal immigrants and to tackling acts of
violence by extremist groups.''

	   ZURICH, Switzerland (AP) _ An officer of world soccer's
governing body has gone to Central America to determine what aid
FIFA should provide to victims of Hurricane Mitch, a statement
said.
	   Angel Maria Villar, president of the Spanish football federation
and a member of the FIFA Executive Committee, flew to Nicaragua on
Thursday for a first-hand review of the needs of that country and
Honduras, it said.
	   He is being joined by Sasso Sasso, the Costa Rican member of the
FIFA committee and the two will report back to FIFA in time for a
Dec. 3 meeting in Zurich to ``decide on appropriate action,'' the
statement said.
	   It said the aid would be sent to the football associations of
the countries.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Boris Yeltsin unexpectedly canceled a dinner with
Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi on Thursday, though the
Kremlin insisted the decision had nothing to do with the Russian
president's health and said he was feeling fine.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov attended the dinner in Yeltsin's
place, according to an agreement worked out with the Japanese
delegation earlier Thursday, a Kremlin spokesman said on condition
of anonymity.
	   The spokesman said the cancellation was not connected to
Yeltsin's health and said he was feeling fine. Members of the
Japanese delegation at the Moscow's Metropol Hotel would not
comment on the change of plans.
	   Yeltsin had just spent a week on vacation at a Black Sea resort
to recover from what aides described as fatigue and high blood
pressure. The ailments, coming on top of a respiratory infection,
have led to renewed speculations about his ability to govern.
	   The summit with Obuchi was Yeltsin's first high-level meeting
since the infection sidelined him a month ago. He was shown on
Russian television greeting the Japanese leader with a smile and
handshake, appearing somewhat steadier than he has in public
recently.
	   Earlier Thursday, Yeltsin's wife said he feels well after the
vacation, but was having trouble adjusting to Moscow's freezing
weather.
	   After a relatively warm October, temperatures in Moscow have
dropped to record lows for this time of year, reaching -19 degrees
C (-2 F) at night, since Yeltsin returned from the Sochi resort on
Sunday.
	   Yeltsin met with Obuchi earlier Thursday, while Yeltsin's wife
Naina spent the day touring Moscow with Obuchi's wife Tizuko.
	   The Russian president is feeling well, ``only the
acclimatization is proceeding rather difficultly,'' Naina Yeltsin
told Mrs. Obuchi, according to the ITAR-Tass news agency.
	   ``I think he will no longer feel (the climate change) in a few
days,'' Mrs. Yeltsin was quoted as saying by the Interfax news
agency.
	   She would not say whether Yeltsin planned to resume his vacation
after Obuchi leaves Moscow.
	   The 67-year-old Russian leader has suffered from various health
troubles in the past, including a quintuple heart bypass surgery
two years ago. But he insists he has no major health problems and
intends to serve out his term, which runs until mid-2000.
	   Yeltsin has canceled several foreign trips this fall because of
health problems, and Russian media have quoted unidentified Kremlin
aides as saying that the president's ailments rule out any more
visits abroad during the remainder of his term.
	   But the Kremlin has dismissed the speculation, and Yeltsin's
visit to India is still on schedule for December.
	   The visit ``is still marked on the calendar,'' parliament
speaker Gennady Seleznyov said Thursday after meeting with a
delegation of Indian lawmakers.

Daimler-Benz, Chrysler complete dlrs 75 billion merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CLARIFIES that dlrs 75 million reflects total worth of merged
company including auto and non-auto divisions. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz confirmed the completion
of its merger with Chrysler on Thursday, creating the world's
third-largest automobile company based on 1997 revenues and an
industrial group valued at dlrs 75 million.
	   The dlrs 75 million reflects the total worth of the merged
company including their vehicle and non-vehicle divisions. The
price of the stock transaction for the merger was put at dlrs 37
million.
	   The new DaimlerChrysler AG will have operational headquarters in
Stuttgart, Germany and in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
	   A company statement lists 12 shareholder representatives that
will make up DaimlerChrysler's Supervisory board, including Hilmar
Kopper the chairman of Deutsche Bank, and Robert E. Allen, the
former chairman of the board and chief executive AT and T.
	   The supervisory board will be organized under the German
Co-determination Law as soon as requisite legal proceedings can be
completed, the statement said.
	   At that time, the number of shareholder representatives will be
reduced from 12 to 10, with 10 employee representatives added to
constitute a 20 member supervisory board, the statement said.
	   Terms of the merger were approved by Daimler-Benz and Chrysler
shareholders at meetings held on Sept. 18.
	   Under an exchange offer completed on Nov. 6, Daimler-Benz
shareholders receive 1.005 shares of the newly formed
DaimlerChrysler AG for each Daimler-Benz share.
	   The companies said that the offer, which attracted over 98
percent of Daimler-Benz shares, and a recently completed Chrysler
share contribution would permit the new company to use pooling of
interests accounting and avoid goodwill charges in reporting future
results.
	   Chrysler shareholders receive 0.6235 of a DaimlerChrysler share
for each Chrysler share, the statement said.
	   Chrysler shares will cease trading on the New York Stock
Exchange at the close of business Thursday, the statement said.
	   Trading with the DCX symbol is scheduled to commence on both the
NYSE and Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
	   Daimler will remain listed as a separate company in Germany
until lawsuits filed by shareholders challenging the stock swap are
resolved.
	   Deutsche Bank has been appointed the exchange agent for
Daimler-Benz shares. The Bank of New York is acting as the exchange
agent for Chrysler shares, the statement said.
	   Daimler-Benz AG of Stuttgart is a holding company with diverse
operations and Europe's largest industrial group.
	   Its operations include the Mercedes-Benz car and truck division,
Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA) and financial services unit,
Daimler-Benz Interservice AG (Debis).

	   GENEVA (AP) _ Moroccan candidate Hassan Abouyoub called for
``fresh efforts of adjustment and change'' Thursday as World Trade
Organization members wrapped up consideration of four leadership
hopefuls.
	   Abouyoub, 46, led Morocco's entry to the 132-nation WTO's
predecessor, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and its
trade negotiations with the European Union. He is now an ambassador
in charge of trade negotiations.
	   He is one of four candidates to replace outgoing WTO
Director-General Renato Ruggiero, who will step down by the end of
April.
	   Although the trade watchdog's new chief will have a ``mission''
to bring on board some 30 countries who are waiting to join,
``nobody is prepared to discount on principles,'' Abouyoub said.
	   He added that he would work to ``bridge the gap between the rich
and poor in the institution.''
	   WTO members will decide the leadership contest by consensus
rather than a vote and the body hopes to confirm the appointment by
the end of this year.
	   The other candidates _ Thai Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi, former New Zealand premier Mike Moore, and former
Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren _ have already faced trade
ambassadors this week.

France requests Pinochet's extradition

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ French authorities on Thursday officially asked
Britain to extradite former Chilean leader Augusto Pinochet so he
can face charges related to the disappearance of French citizens.
	   A Justice Ministry statement said the extradition request was
sent to British authorities via the French Foreign Ministry.
	   A French court sent a temporary arrest warrant for Pinochet to
British authorities on Nov. 3, accusing him of ``sequestration
followed by torture.''
	   It was the final step necessary before France could officially
ask for extradition.
	   Three French families have filed complaints against Pinochet in
France.
	   The relative of one of them, Etienne Pesle, disappeared after
military officials arrested him in his office in September 1973. He
had lived for several years in Chile with his Chilean wife and
three children.
	   The last report of Pesle seen alive was by a Chilean soldier,
who said he saw Pesle soon after being driven out of a military
camp, his hands tied behind his back.
	   Pinochet was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a Spanish extradition
warrant citing charges of genocide, torture and kidnapping during
his 17-year rule, which began in 1973 when he toppled Salvador
Allende.
	   Switzerland also has requested Pinochet's arrest and extradition
on charges of murder, kidnapping and torture. And Chilean exiles in
Sweden, Belgium, Norway and Germany have filed criminal complaints
they hope will lead to extradition requests.
	   In Britain Thursday, prosecutors wrapped up their appeal of a
court ruling allowing Pinochet immunity from prosecution there,
arguing that the crimes against humanity he is charged with
``unequivocally'' violate international law.
	   A report by Chile's government says about 3,000 people were
killed or disappeared at the hands of secret police under Pinochet.
	   Tens of thousands of others disappeared during the same era in
other Latin American countries, most notably in Argentina where at
least 10,000 people fell victim to a rightist dictatorship.
	   A French lawyer on Thursday released a list of 12 French and
Franco-Chilean citizens who disappeared in Argentina and Chile
during the 1970s.
	   Jacques Miquel said he suspected that the victims who
disappeared in Argentina were arrested at Pinochet's request during
Operation Condor, when several South American military juntas
teamed up to crush leftists and dissidents.
	   Miquel claimed that former Argentine Navy Chief Adm. Emilio
Massera in November 1978 gave then-French President Valery Giscard
d'Estaing a list of the French victims.
	   Miquel asked the French judge handling the Pinochet case to
summon both Giscard and Massera to testify.
	   Massera, navy commander during the first four years of the
Argentine dictatorship, was sentenced to life in prison in 1985 for
human rights violations, including illegal arrests, torture, and
execution of thousands of opponents.
	   Along with other military officials, he was pardoned by
President Carlos Menem in 1990.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serb civilians seized dozens of
ethnic Albanians hostages on Thursday and Albanian rebels vowed
revenge for five dead comrades, battering the spirit of a peace
accord meant to end the crisis in Kosovo.
	   Up to 100 ethnic Albanians were taken hostage, said the Kosovo
Information Center, which is close to the Kosovo Albanian
leadership. The figures could not be independently confirmed.
	   Serb civilians were seeking the release of two people who
disappeared Wednesday in the central Drenica region. The center
said some of those detained were threatened with ``liquidation''
unless the two Serbs were released.
	   The detentions and a funeral for slain fighters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army guerillas reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian
tensions even after an Oct. 12 agreement to end the crisis in the
province of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists has left
hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat heading an effort to carry
out the peace deal in Kosovo, promised to ``take appropriate
steps'' after finding out the exact circumstances of the
detentions.
	   The ethnic Albanians were reportedly taken off a bus near the
border with Montenegro and transported to Crnac, a village 30 miles
(50 kilometers) northwest of Pristina.
	   Serb sources confirmed the abduction, but said those taken were
being released. One of those released, Rahim Kadriu, said about 30
people remained in the custody of the Serbs.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
results from the October agreement were taking shape, ``but we have
a long way to go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet Walker, said he would
be going to Belgrade on Friday to talk with Serb authorities on
implementation of a plan that would give Kosovo Albanians wide
autonomy.
	   In the western village of Retimlje, about 100 uniformed KLA
guerrillas attended a memorial for two of five fighters killed last
week. Many cried openly during an emotional speech by Sebajdin
Cena, a KLA commander.
	   Gjelal Hajda, 31, and Selajdin Mullaabazi, 28, died when their
cars encountered a Serb police patrol. Police said the guerrillas
fired first.
	   ``Their deaths unite us even more, and their blood gives us more
strength,'' Cena said.
	   The dead guerrillas ``will constantly ask us ... `Have you
fulfilled our last wish, did you take revenge for us?' '' he said.
``We tell them ... that we continue to fight, we continue to spill
blood because we are the sons of Albanians.''

Jordan warns against holding pro-Iraq demonstrations
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By JAMAL HALABY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ Jordan warned its citizens Thursday against
holding pro-Iraqi demonstrations and urged a diplomatic solution to
the Iraqi crisis.
	   ``The picture is bleak in the absence of an effective Arab
diplomacy vis-a-vis the Iraqi conflict,'' said Crown Prince Hassan,
who is acting as regent while King Hussein is away.
	   ``The situation is very dangerous,'' he added.
	   Prime Minister Fayez Tarawneh, warning that a U.S. military
strike on Iraq was imminent, outlined Jordan's contingency plans in
case it is faced with an influx of refugees from neighboring Iraq.
	   Also, he said his government was trying to find alternative
sources to oil supplies should Jordan's energy lifeline get cut off
in the event of a sweeping strike on Iraq. Jordan imports all its
oil needs from Iraq.
	   ``We know that danger is nearing,'' said Tarawneh, who met with
U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen in Amman last week to discuss
the Iraqi crisis.
	   He said he expects 500,000 refugees to flee Iraq, but hinted
that Jordan will not allow them in.
	   Some 2.6 million refugees, including 600,000 Iraqi nationals,
fled Iraq during the 1990 Gulf War, putting heavy strains on the
Jordanian economy.
	   ``We will cooperate with all international relief agencies to
send any supplies to Iraq, but not to Jordan,'' he said, adding
that hosting refugees in camps near the Iraqi border ``means that
the camps will remain indefinitely and this is something we will
not accept.''
	   Tarawneh said pro-Iraqi protests will not be permitted.
	   ``We will not allow demonstrations or public meetings that could
threaten national security,'' he said.
	   ``We urge Jordanians to exercise self-restraint in view of the
gravity of the crisis,'' he said.
	   Last February, one person was killed and 24 were wounded in
pro-Iraqi demonstrations which turned into riots in the Jordanian
town of Maan.
	   The demonstrators were protesting against a threatened U.S.
attack against Iraq to force free access for U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Nearly 30 people were arrested and later freed in the protests
in Maan, a desert town 250 kilometers (150 miles) south of the
capital, Amman.

U.S. signing of global warming treaty: ``Not enough'' critics

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The United States' announcement
Thursday that it is signing the Kyoto global warming treaty
energized last-hour talks here on how to implement the accord's key
provisions for cutting pollutants such as carbon dioxide.
	   But critics said details of U.S. intentions, conveyed here by
U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, appeared short on
concrete action that the world's largest polluter would take to
roll back its emissions of the heat-trapping gases blamed for
global warming.
	   The United States was the last of the major industrial nations
to say it would sign the accord agreed to last December in Kyoto,
Japan, calling for reductions in ``greenhouse'' emissions by
industrialized nations by 2012.
	   The U.S. signing is largely symbolic, because it still needs to
be ratified in Congress, where there is firm opposition to the
accord.
	   Developing nations, which are not legally bound to emissions
targets under the treaty but under pressure to participate,
maintain the United States is not taking climate change seriously
enough.
	   The developing nations say such emission controls place a
relatively higher burden on their economies than on the United
States, and they generally oppose endorsing such controls,
especially without firm U.S. commitments to carry them out.
	   But on Wednesday, Argentina became the first major developing
nation to announce it would take voluntary action to curb
greenhouse gases, a move seen as a breakthrough by U.S. officials.
Developing nations China and India, two of the biggest contributors
of heat-trapping carbon, have steadfastly refused to participate.
	   Eizenstat told the representatives of more than 160 countries
here that Washington was promoting new energy efficiency standards
for appliances and cleaner technologies for industry, but gave few
other specifics on how the United States would cut emissions.
	   Alden Meyer, of the Washington-based Union of Concerned
Scientists, said it was helpful to have the United States sign the
accord.
	   But ``if we had to grade Eizenstat, we'd give him an
`incomplete' on (cleaning up) power plants and he does nothing to
deal with our gas-guzzling passenger vehicle fleet,'' Meyer said.
	   ``The key to success over the next couple years is doing more at
home in the United States to cut emissions, particularly in the two
major sectors: coal-fired power plants and cars.''
	   The New York-based Environmental Defense Fund said the U.S.
signing was a start.
	   ``The buildup of greenhouse gases will not be stopped by the
stroke of a pen,'' group executive director Fred Krupp said. ``The
administration must back up their work to move the negotiations
forward here with real efforts to reduce admissions at home.''
	   Remaining issues in the waning hours of the Buenos Aires meeting
include a U.S. call to allow industrial nations to ``trade''
emissions targets to cut costs. Opponents say such a mechanism
would let Washington paper over any real work to cut pollution.
	   Many scientists believe Earth is gradually warming because of
these emissions. But critics of the theory in the United States say
global warming scenarios have not been proven and that the cost of
cutting greenhouses gases threatens U.S. industry.

Prosecutor urges death penalty for 13 Christian ex-militiamen
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A prosecutor asked a military court
Thursday to sentence 13 former members of a Christian militia to
death for trying to destabilize Lebanon through a bombing campaign,
the official news agency reported.
	   Military prosecutor Riyad Talieh accused the ex-members of the
Lebanese Forces of forming ``a gang with the aim of attacking
people and properties and attempting to carry out terrorist acts
with bombs and inflammable material.''
	   His formal indictment also accused them of planning to
assassinate Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr and Electricity and
Hydrologic Resources Minister Elias Hobeika, the National News
Agency reported.
	   The charge sheet said the right-wing militiamen planted a bomb
on a bus in Damascus, Syria, in 1996 that killed 11 people. They
allegedly attacked a Syrian bus in Lebanon in 1996, killing its
driver, and were responsible for an explosion at the main Beirut
bus terminal in Oct. 1997 that did not harm anybody.
	   Security forces rounded up the ex-militiamen earlier this year
after two alleged collaborators died in Beirut in June when one of
their bombs exploded prematurely.
	   Prosecutor Talieh also charged eight other ex-members of the
Lebanese Forces with illegally contacting Israel and trying to get
arms from that country. Lebanon is technically at war with Israel,
which occupies a border enclave in southern Lebanon.
	   On these charges, he asked the court to hand down sentences
ranging from three years to 15 years with hard labor.
	   The accused were not asked to plead to the charges.
	   Nine of those charged with destabilization and four of those
accused of contact with Israel are in custody, the agency said. The
others are still at large and will be tried in absentia.
	   The Lebanese Forces was the main Christian militia during the
1975-90 civil war. It was disbanded by the government in 1994. The
militia opposed Syrian influence in Lebanon and had close ties with
Israel.
	   Syria maintains some 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the main
power broker in the country.

Palestinians angry at Israeli riders on Wye accord

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel angered Palestinians Thursday by giving
the go-ahead for construction of a Jewish housing project in a
disputed area of Jerusalem, but also pledged to begin turning over
West Bank territory next week.
	   Dennis Ross, the United States special Middle East envoy, is to
arrive here Friday to oversee implementation of the nascent Mideast
land-for-security accord, and Palestinian officials were already
calling on him to help solve the latest disputes.
	   ``It is now crucial to have the American side join us ... to
oversee implementation of the agreement, '' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. He told The Associated Press, ``We will not
accept any post-agreement negotiations and will not accept any
conditions outside,'' the accord itself, signed at the White House
Oct. 26.
	   Under the accord narrowly ratified by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu's Cabinet Wednesday, Israel is to carry out a staged
troop withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security measures.
	   Israel's plans to hand over the first parcel of land by the end
of next week, said David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu.
And there were signs on the ground Thursday that implementation of
some aspects was close.
	   At the Palestinian airport in Gaza, near the Egyptian border,
Israeli and Palestinian officials drilled security procedures for
checking passengers.
	   Israeli soldiers were seen pulling equipment out of an army base
in the West Bank, near the Palestinian village of Dura. It was not
clear if the base is to be evacuated as part of the Israeli
redeployment.
	   However, Palestinians focused attention on Israel's decision to
accept bids for construction at a Jerusalem hilltop Israelis call
Har Homa and Palestinians know as Jabel Abu Ghneim. The hilltop is
part of land Israel captured from Jordan and annexed after the 1967
Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a
future state in the area.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the project ``a big
obstacle,'' to peace, but stopped short of saying it would harm the
peace process. In Washington, State Department spokesman James
Rubin said Israel had made ``a bad decision,'' in going ahead with
the plan.
	   Ground breaking there in January, 1997 for the 6,000 homes
planned for Jews, led to Palestinian rioting and a 19-month-long
stalemate in negotiations broken after Netanyahu and Arafat signed
the latest peace deal. Netanyahu has promised repeatedly the new
homes would be ready there in 2000.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an aide to Arafat, called the project and a
series of new Israeli conditions on the peace accord, ``a violation
of the ... agreement and of all agreements.''
	   Wednesday, Netanyahu warned that if the Palestinians go through
with a plan to unilaterally declare independence when the interim
peace accords expire in May, Israel will annex all West Bank
territory it still controls.
	   Arafat left the issue open, saying the issue of statehood could
be negotiated.
	   ``May 4 is the end of the five-year period we agreed upon in
Oslo. If there are other ideas, I'm ready to listen,'' Arafat was
quoted as saying.

	   TEGUCIGALPA, Honduras (AP) _ Law students blistered their hands
at shovels alongside roaring earthmovers on Thursday, trying to rid
Honduras' capital of thick layers of mud left by Hurricane Mitch.
	   As increasing foreign aid pours in for Honduras and Nicaragua,
where nearly 10,000 died, much of the recovery is a matter of sheer
hard work by thousands of ordinary citizens.
	   ``We will rebuild,'' insisted Francis Juarez, a law student who
showed off the blisters on her hands from shoveling stinking black
muck from shops on a street where Mexican army engineers then
bulldozed it away.
	   An 8-foot-high (2 1/2-meter-high) line on the walls behind her
showed the level reached on Oct. 30-31 by the Choluteca River,
normally some 15 feet (4.5 meters) below the street and two blocks
away.
	   ``I had never seen my country like this,'' said Hector Duran, an
engineering student standing in the two-foot-deep mud. ``If we all
make an effort we will come out ahead.''
	   In a radio speech Thursday, President Carlos Flores Facusse
appealed for the United States and other countries to increase aid
to his stricken nation and forgive its debts.
	   But he also aimed a call to his countrymen to ``redouble your
efforts and your work to rebuild the country as rapidly as
possible.''
	   ``The time has come for us to jointly face the apocalyptic
reality of our villages and cities ... and try to create a Honduras
that is renewed, vigorous, modern and better.''
	   Not all had faith in heroic efforts, however.
	   The nation's top business group, the Honduran Private Enterprise
Council, urged the government to extend a curfew and state of
emergency imposed on Nov. 2 that suspended civil rights in order to
avoid massive looting.
	   Aid _ and promises of more _ continued to arrive from across the
globe.
	   The Rome-base U.N. world Food Program announced Thursday that it
would distribute more than 100,000 tons of rice, corn, fish and oil
over the next six months in the hurricane-hit countries.
	   ``With emergency assistance, these people are at extreme
nutritional risk _ in addition to facing the threat of cholera and
other diseases,'' said Catherine Bertini, the agency's executive
director.
	   Flores Facusse said repairs could cost four times Honduras'
planned dlrs 1.2 billion budget. He urged the United States to lead
nations working to forgive Honduras' dlrs 4.3 billion in debts,
grant it free trade status and help with ``a massive supply of
fresh resources to aid in rebuilding the country.''
	   He also asked the European Union to lift its limits on Central
American bananas _ though officials say this year's Honduran crop
is virtually lost.
	   The United States is part of the Paris Club of creditor nations,
which announced Thursday it will probably grant debt relief to
Honduras and Nicaragua when it meets in early December.
	   France on Tuesday canceled debts owed by Nicaragua and Honduras,
while Ireland, Britain, Italy, Mexico, Jamaica and dozens of other

so far there was 2,362 dead, 287 injured, 970 missing and 36,000

	   Several hundred people also died in Guatemala and El Salvador.

``This was our life. We will do it again.''

work.''

Yugoslav government halts money flow with Serb-run Bosnia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) _ The government on Thursday halted
the money flow in the national currency between Yugoslavia and
fellow Serbs after the latter raised the official exchange rate of
the Yugoslav dinar.
	   Earlier this year, Bosnian Serbs introduced the official Bosnian
post-war currency, the convertible mark, which is equal to one
German mark, but also kept the Yugoslav dinar in circulation.
	   In Yugoslavia, one German mark is worth six dinars, while the
Bosnian Serb government recently decided that one convertible mark
was worth 7.5 dinars, lowering the value of the Yugoslav currency.
That prompted the Yugoslav government to halt the money flow at a
session Thursday.
	   The 7.5 dinar rate about equals the exchange rate of the dinar
on the black market in Yugoslavia.
	   The Bosnian Serb republic and Yugoslavia basically have
functioned as one market so far. Belgrade's move would halt all
trade between the Bosnian Serbs and Yugoslavia, the main source of
food and other consumer goods imports.
	   As inside Yugoslavia, all money transfers between the Bosnian
Serb republic and Yugoslavia have been carried out through some
clearing house system, with the dinar the common currency.
	   The government said the move was aimed at ``protecting the
domestic economy and people's living standards,'' the Fonet news
agency reported.
	   It also said the decision would remain in force until the
Bosnian Serb government fixes the official exchange rate to equal
the one in Yugoslavia.
	   Independent economists in Yugoslavia believe that the exchange
rate for the dinar should be higher than the one proclaimed by the
government. The German mark is used in Yugoslavia alongside the
dinar.
	   Also on Thursday, a top Serbian government official blamed a
recent rise in the black market exchange rate on the Bosnian Serb
government decision not to respect the official Yugoslav rate.
Dragan Tomic, a Serbian deputy premier, said he hoped there would
be no further decline in the value of the dinar.
	   Serbia is the dominant republic in Yugoslavia, which also
includes Montenegro. Bosnian Serbs have close political and
economic ties with Yugoslavia, overwhelmingly populated by Serbs.

Lebanese prosecutor urges death penalty for 13 Christian
</HEADLINE>
ex-militiamen &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) _ A prosecutor asked a military court
Thursday to sentence 13 former members of a Christian militia to
death for trying to destabilize Lebanon through a bombing campaign,
the official news agency reported.
	   Military prosecutor Riyad Talieh accused the ex-members of the
Lebanese Forces of forming ``a gang with the aim of attacking
people and properties and attempting to carry out terrorist acts
with bombs and inflammable material.''
	   His formal indictment also accused them of planning to
assassinate Deputy Prime Minister Michel Murr and Electricity and
Hydrologic Resources Minister Elias Hobeika, the National News
Agency reported.
	   The charge sheet said the right-wing militiamen planted a bomb
on a bus in Damascus, Syria, in 1996 that killed 11 people. They
allegedly attacked a Syrian bus in Lebanon in 1996, killing its
driver, and were responsible for an explosion at the main Beirut
bus terminal in Oct. 1997 that did not harm anybody.
	   Security forces rounded up the ex-militiamen earlier this year
after two alleged collaborators died in Beirut in June when one of
their bombs exploded prematurely.
	   Prosecutor Talieh also charged eight other ex-members of the
Lebanese Forces with illegally contacting Israel and trying to get
arms from that country. Lebanon is technically at war with Israel,
which occupies a border enclave in southern Lebanon.
	   On these charges, he asked the court to hand down sentences
ranging from three years to 15 years with hard labor.
	   The accused were not asked to plead to the charges.
	   Nine of those charged with destabilization and four of those
accused of contact with Israel are in custody, the agency said. The
others are still at large and will be tried in absentia.
	   The Lebanese Forces was the main Christian militia during the
1975-90 civil war. It was disbanded by the government in 1994. The
militia opposed Syrian influence in Lebanon and had close ties with
Israel.
	   Syria maintains some 30,000 soldiers in Lebanon and is the main
power broker in the country.

 &UR; Europe's new currency won't deliberately challenge dollar &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with details thruout. Trims. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Europe's new central bank won't try to contest
the dollar's international dominance with its new euro currency,
the bank's president said Thursday.
	   ``There will be no deliberate policy of challenging the U.S.
dollar,'' Wim Duisenberg said in the text of a speech to the
Economic Club of New York.
	   The new central bank, he said, ``will accept the international
role of the euro as it develops through market forces.''
	   Still, Duisenberg said the euro, which will be launched Jan. 1
in 11 of the 15 European Union nations, will be a major world
currency.
	   The European Central Bank ``will have an important international
role to play,'' Duisenberg said, noting that one-fourth of the
world's currency reserves are held in European currencies that will
merge into the euro.
	   ``I could well imagine that many central banks in the world
will, ultimately, hold at least an appropriate proportion in
euro,'' he said.
	   The central bank will conduct monetary policy for the euro
nations starting Jan. 1, setting a single interest rate for
participants.
	   The ambitious project has recently been challenged by a
political shift in Europe. Center-right governments have been
replaced by center-left administrations intent on reducing the
nation's high unemployment rates. Finance officials in Germany have
said the jobs push may necessitate increased government spending.
	   Duisenberg appealed for restraint, calling for ``sound budgetary
policies and responsible wage behavior.'' He warned that increased
spending would hurt efforts to pare government budget deficits.
	   More spending also could imperil the ECB's central task _ to
keep inflation low and prices stable, Duisenberg said.

Daimler-Benz, Chrysler complete dlrs 37 billion merger
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to billion in first two grafs, CLARIFIES that dlrs 75
billion reflects total worth of merged company &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz confirmed the completion
of its merger with Chrysler on Thursday, creating the world's
third-largest automobile company based on 1997 revenues and an
industrial group valued at dlrs 75 billion.
	   The dlrs 75 billion reflects the total worth of the merged
company including their vehicle and non-vehicle divisions. The
price of the stock transaction for the merger was put at dlrs 37
billion.
	   The new DaimlerChrysler AG will have operational headquarters in
Stuttgart, Germany and in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
	   A company statement lists 12 shareholder representatives that
will make up DaimlerChrysler's Supervisory board, including Hilmar
Kopper the chairman of Deutsche Bank, and Robert E. Allen, the
former chairman of the board and chief executive AT and T.
	   The supervisory board will be organized under the German
Co-determination Law as soon as requisite legal proceedings can be
completed, the statement said.
	   At that time, the number of shareholder representatives will be
reduced from 12 to 10, with 10 employee representatives added to
constitute a 20 member supervisory board, the statement said.
	   Terms of the merger were approved by Daimler-Benz and Chrysler
shareholders at meetings held on Sept. 18.
	   Under an exchange offer completed on Nov. 6, Daimler-Benz
shareholders receive 1.005 shares of the newly formed
DaimlerChrysler AG for each Daimler-Benz share.
	   The companies said that the offer, which attracted over 98
percent of Daimler-Benz shares, and a recently completed Chrysler
share contribution would permit the new company to use pooling of
interests accounting and avoid goodwill charges in reporting future
results.
	   Chrysler shareholders receive 0.6235 of a DaimlerChrysler share
for each Chrysler share, the statement said.
	   Chrysler shares will cease trading on the New York Stock
Exchange at the close of business Thursday, the statement said.
	   Trading with the DCX symbol is scheduled to commence on both the
NYSE and Frankfurt Stock Exchange on Tuesday.
	   Daimler will remain listed as a separate company in Germany
until lawsuits filed by shareholders challenging the stock swap are
resolved.
	   Deutsche Bank has been appointed the exchange agent for
Daimler-Benz shares. The Bank of New York is acting as the exchange
agent for Chrysler shares, the statement said.
	   Daimler-Benz AG of Stuttgart is a holding company with diverse
operations and Europe's largest industrial group.
	   Its operations include the Mercedes-Benz car and truck division,
Daimler-Benz Aerospace AG (DASA) and financial services unit,
Daimler-Benz Interservice AG (Debis).

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel angered Palestinians Thursday by giving
the go-ahead for construction of a Jewish housing project in a
disputed area of Jerusalem, but also pledged to begin turning over
West Bank territory next week.
	   Dennis Ross, the United States special Middle East envoy, is to
arrive Friday in Israel to oversee implementation of the nascent
Mideast land-for-security accord, and Palestinian officials were
already calling on him to help solve the latest disputes.
	   ``It is now crucial to have the American side join us ... to
oversee implementation of the agreement,'' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat.
	   He told The Associated Press, ``We will not accept any
post-agreement negotiations and will not accept any conditions
outside,'' the accord itself, signed at the White House Oct. 26.
	   Under the accord narrowly ratified Wednesday by Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu's Cabinet, Israel is to carry out a staged troop
withdrawal from 13 percent of the West Bank in exchange for
Palestinian security measures.
	   Israel's plans to hand over the first parcel of land next week,
said David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu. And there were
signs on the ground Thursday that implementation of some aspects
was close.
	   At the Palestinian airport in Gaza, near the Egyptian border,
Israeli and Palestinian officials drilled security procedures for
checking passengers.
	   Israeli soldiers were seen pulling equipment out of an army base
in the West Bank, near the Palestinian village of Dura. It was not
clear if the base is to be evacuated as part of the Israeli
redeployment.
	   However, Palestinians focused attention on Israel's decision to
accept bids for construction at a Jerusalem hilltop Israelis call
Har Homa and Palestinians know as Jabal Abu Ghneim. The hilltop is
part of land Israel captured from Jordan and annexed after the 1967
Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a
future state in the area.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the project ``a big
obstacle,'' to peace, but stopped short of saying it would harm the
peace process. In Washington, U.S. State Department spokesman James
P. Rubin said Israel had made ``a bad decision,'' in going ahead
with the plan.

Lawyer denies 'the Jackal's' links with Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The defense lawyer for the
international terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal denied Thursday
his client ever had any connection with Romania's Communist
era-secret police.
	   ``These allegations are absurd and they are poisonous,''
Isabelle Coutant Peyre, one of Ramirez's defense lawyers told
Romanian private television ProTV. She also said there is an
international plot against her client.
	   Peyre said that Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez, never worked for Romania's former Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu nor had a bank account in Romania.
	   ``He never had a bank account anywhere in this world,'' Peyre
said.
	   The Venezuelan-born Ramirez is serving a term of life in a Paris
prison for the 1975 murders of two French investigators and a
Lebanese, and is under investigation for as many as four terrorist
attacks in France.
	   Earlier this week, Romanian prosecutors charged Ramirez with
crimes against humanity, accusing him of committing several
terrorist acts in France and Germany between 1977 and 1981, on
Ceausescu's orders.
	   They also said they discovered a Romanian bank account some dlrs
1,000 in under the name of Ramirez's ex-wife, Magdalena Kopp.
	   Romanian media reported early this year that Ramirez had been
employed by Ceausescu to blow up the Romanian Service of Radio Free
Europe in February 1981.
	   Nine people were injured in the attack on the Munich-based radio
station.
	   Neculai Constantin Munteanu, then a reporter for Radio Free
Europe who investigated the case, told ProTV Thursday proof
Ramirez' involvement in the attack are in the archives of the
former East German secret police, the Stasi.
	   Ramirez, who was captured in 1994, is believed responsible for
the death of at least 83 people. He has been linked to the 1975
seizure of OPEC oil ministers in Vienna and the 1976 hijacking of
an Air France jet to Uganda.
	   On Monday, his lawyers said he has been refusing food and water
for several days to protest his treatment in prison.

Immigrants occupy Bologna basilica, demand housing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Hundreds of immigrants occupied a basilica
in the city of Bologna Thursday, demanding housing from the city.
	   According to Italian media reports, the immigrants, mostly North
Africans, had taken over an empty building belonging to the public
housing authority over the weekend.
	   After their eviction Thursday morning, they moved into the
Basilica of San Petronio in one of the city's main piazzas.
	   Police at the scene tried to negotiate, but the immigrants
refused to leave. They threatened to go on a hunger strike if their
demand for housing was not met, the reports said.
	   France has had a spate of church occupations in the past year by
illegal immigrants seeking permission to stay in France.
	   In contrast, the initial reports from Bologna indicated that
most of the people involved in the basilica occupation were in
Italy legally.

Apartment of Swiss Christians ransacked by ultra-Orthodox Jews
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Ultra-Orthodox Jews ransacked apartments
belonging to two Swiss Christian women Thursday, throwing their
possessions and furniture off a fourth-floor balcony.
	   About 500 Jews were involved in the attack, said Israeli
policeman Doron Turjeman, the senior officer on the scene. Six
people were arrested.
	   The incident took place in Jerusalem's overwhelmingly
ultra-Orthodox neighborhood of Mea Shearim, where secular Jews and
Arabs have also come under attack.
	   Israeli media reported that residents of the neighborhood
believed the women were involved in Christian missionary work,
which Israel has tried to keep out of the country. Israeli TVs
likened the attack to a pogrom _ a reference to organized rampages
through Jews communities in eastern Europe at the hands of non-Jews
in the late 19th century.
	   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, re-elected Tuesday with the support
of the ultra-Orthodox Jews, denounced the attack. He said a violent
fringe group was responsible, and cautioned against blaming the
entire ultra-Orthodox community.
	   Turjeman said one of the women was at home when the Jews
attacked. She was rescued through the back door of her apartment.
	   Olmert declared that everyone involved should be jailed. ``I
hope they are put in prison for a long, long time so that their
friends will learn that there is a price to pay for breaking the
law,'' Olmert told Israel radio.
	   Jerusalem's ultra-Orthodox community stages violent protests
regularly outside non-Kosher restaurants and disrupts traffic
through their neighborhoods during the Jewish Sabbath which begins
with sundown each Friday and ends after sunset Saturday. The
community is growing in numbers and gaining political power.

IMF rescue package could prompt new reduction in Brazil's interest

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ After lowering the key lending rate,
Brazil's government has turned its attention to a long-awaited
international rescue package that could prompt a further interest
rate cut to boost the sagging economy.
	   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee lowered the annual
interest rate Wednesday night from 49.75 percent to 42.25 percent.
	   Brazil nearly doubled its key lending rate in September to halt
the flight of investors after Russia's August devaluation raised
fears of emerging markets. The country's foreign reserves have
since fallen to around dlrs 43 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the
end of July.
	   Capital flight continues, although at a slower pace.
	   After posting a massive net outflow of dlrs 21 billion in
September and October, Brazil's exchange market have lost a slimmer
dlrs 66 million this month.
	   Commenting on interest rate reduction, Antonio Costa, a director
at a Sao Paulo-based asset management company said ``the central
bank played conservative because of a variety of pending factors.''
	   He cited congressional approval of fiscal austerity measures, a
reduction in capital flight and confirmation of an aid package from
international lenders as necessary precursors to larger rate cuts.
	   ``The reduction was a positive sign, but not enough to revive
economic activity,'' said Clarice Seibel, head of the Research and
Economic Studies Department of the Federation of Industries of the
State of Sao Paulo.
	   ``We expected the government to adopt a much more aggressive and
less conservative attitude,'' she said, adding that the federation
would prefer interest rates of 23 percent to 24 percent.
	   ``But the probable approval by Congress of the fiscal austerity
measures and the imminent agreement with the IMF should bring a
bigger interest rate cut in the future,'' she added.
	   Other analysts have predicted that the key lending rate could
drop to between 25 percent and 30 percent by the end of the year.
	   On Oct. 28, the government unveiled an austerity package,
combining new taxes and spending cuts to save dlrs 24 billion in
1999 and dlrs 80 billion by 2002. The measures must be approved by
Congress.
	   The government hopes the measures will qualify Brazil for an IMF
rescue package, expected to be announced within the next few days.
	   The IMF has insisted on a tough plan to slash Brazil's deficit
before going ahead with an estimated dlrs 30 billion to dlrs 40
billion aid program.
	   Analysts say the austerity measures are likely to aggravate the
country's economic slowdown and push unemployment above its current
official rate of 7.8 percent. Independent economists say
unemployment is closer to 20 percent.
	   ``The reduction in the key lending rate will unlikely change the
negative perspectives facing the retail sector,'' said Antonio
Carlos Borges, an economist of the Sao Paulo State Retailers
Federation. ``Consumers are scared of losing their jobs when the
austerity measures start being implemented.''
	   A note issued on Wednesday at the end of a meeting of trade
union leaders said the package of austerity measures was an
extension of the government's economic policies ``that have led the
country to the brink of bankruptcy.''
	   It said the measures would ``exacerbate unemployment, destroy
local industries and create more misery and despair.''
	   The labor leaders called for a temporary suspension of foreign
debt payments, a renegotiation of the internal debt and greater
control on foreign exchange transactions.

<TEXT>
	   BOLOGNA, Italy (AP) _ Hundreds of immigrants occupied a basilica
in the city of Bologna Thursday, demanding housing from the city.
	   According to Italian media reports, the immigrants, mostly North
Africans, had taken over an empty building belonging to the public
housing authority over the weekend.
	   After their eviction Thursday morning, they moved into the
Basilica of San Petronio in one of the city's main piazzas.
	   According to the ANSA news agency, the local head of the
Catholic relief agency Caritas, said the church would allow the
immigrants to spend the night in the basilica.
	   Police at the scene had tried to negotiate their departure, but
without success.
	   The immigrants were threatening to go on a hunger strike if
their demand for housing was not met, the reports said.
	   France has had a spate of church occupations in the past year by
illegal immigrants seeking permission to stay in France.
	   In contrast, the initial reports from Bologna indicated that
most of the people involved in the basilica occupation were in
Italy legally.

Smithsonian tiger exhibit hopes to fight extinction threats

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Stalking the eco-tourist, the U.S.National
Museum of Natural History hopes to lure such visitors with a new
tiger exhibit aimed at boosting the beast's chances of survival in
the wild.
	   Smithsonian officials and tiger conservationists on Thursday
unveiled ``Tigers!'' _ an exposition featuring a stuffed, six-foot
long cat caught in muscle-rippling midlunge at a white-spotted deer
against the background of an Asian savannah.
	   Like the title's exclamation point, the exhibit's sometimes
cliched features include descriptions of ``dagger-sharp claws'' and
images of cuddly tiger cubs at play.
	   But the gaping tiger skull with four arching inch-long incisors
and a touchable paw the size of two human hands testify to the
animal's legendary ferocity.
	   The stuffed deer-attacking tiger, shot in 1967 when tigers were
still considered abundant, drives home the exhibit's theme: Tigers
aren't a threat to people; the real predators are people, who need
to improve how they live with what museum director Robert Fri
called ``non-human communities.''
	   Graphics and videos describe how Asia's growing human population
has driven tigers out of their natural habitat.
	   At the same time, the exhibit depicts positively the
conservation efforts of Nepal's Chitwan National Park, where
surrounding human populations have been enlisted to care for the
tigers' survival, a model conservationists hope to repeat.
	   ``People realize that despite all our problems, poverty and the
(money to be made from) poaching, this is our heritage,'' said
Hemanta Mishra, a Nepalese biologist who works for the World Bank.
	   Mishra said the exhibit's sponsors believe it will spread
awareness of the tigers' plight and help build the international
political will needed to keep them in their natural habitat.
	   Tigers in captivity far outnumber the sparse tiger population in
the wild, with estimates ranging from 3,000 to 7,000 still living
on their own in India, China, the jungles of Southeast Asia and the
Siberian tundra, down from the 100,000 who spanned the region 100
years ago.
	   In the past 70 years, three species _ the Bali, Javan and
Caspian tigers _ have become extinct. Only some 350 Siberian tigers
exist in the wild, with around five times that number in zoos or
otherwise under the control of humans.
	   ``Tigers!'' opens Friday and will remain on view indefinitely.

Lawyer denies Carlos's links with Romania
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ The defense lawyer for the convicted
terrorist known as Carlos the Jackal denied Thursday his client
ever had any connection with Romania's Communist-era secret police.
	   ``These allegations are absurd and they are poisonous,''
Isabelle Coutant Peyre, one of Carlos's defense lawyers, told
Romanian private television ProTV. She also claimed there is an
international plot against her client.
	   Peyre said that Carlos, whose real name is Ilich Ramirez
Sanchez, never worked for Romania's former Communist dictator
Nicolae Ceausescu nor had a bank account in Romania.
	   ``He never had a bank account anywhere in this world,'' Peyre
said.
	   The Venezuelan-born Ramirez is serving a term of life in a Paris
prison for the 1975 murders of two French investigators and a
Lebanese, and is under investigation for as many as four terrorist
attacks in France.
	   Earlier this week, Romanian prosecutors charged Carlos with
crimes against humanity, accusing him of committing several
terrorist acts in France and Germany between 1977 and 1981, on
Ceausescu's orders.
	   They also said they discovered a Romanian bank account with some
dlrs 1,000 in under the name of Ramirez's ex-wife, Magdalena Kopp.
	   Romanian media reported early this year that Carlos had been
employed by Ceausescu to blow up the Romanian Service of Radio Free
Europe in February 1981.
	   Nine people were injured in the attack on the Munich-based radio
station.
	   Neculai Constantin Munteanu, then a reporter for Radio Free
Europe who investigated the case, told ProTV Thursday that proof of
Carlos's involvement in the attack are in the archives of the
former East German secret police, the Stasi.

	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
plans to meet with the U.N. Security Council on Friday but has no
plans to fly to Baghdad to mediate in the latest Iraq crisis.
	   Annan cut short a trip through north Africa because of the Iraqi
standoff and returned to New York Thursday afternoon, telling
reporters he needed to talk to his staff and ``inform myself'' of
the latest developments.
	   ``I have no plans to go to Baghdad at the moment, but I need to
talk to the council members,'' he said.
	   Earlier, the secretary-general's spokesman Fred Eckhard said
Annan ``does not at this time see a possible role for himself'' as
mediator in Baghdad. ``That's not to say he would not be available
if the council asked him to do something,'' Eckhard added.

Insurance companies set up fund for Holocaust victims
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Six European insurance companies have pledged dlrs
90 million to a humanitarian fund for Holocaust victims, in
addition to paying wartime insurance claims they owe.
	   ``We view this as a historic achievement; one that demonstrates
the willingness of these insurance companies to bring justice at
last to the victims of the most heinous crime of our time,'' Elan
Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress, said
Thursday.
	   The World Jewish Congress is a member of the newly established
International Commission on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, which
announced the insurance agreement after a meeting in London on
Wednesday.
	   The dlrs 90 million pledged to the humanitarian fund was a
gesture of good faith, and not necessarily a final sum, Steinberg
said in a telephone interview.
	   In addition, he said, they have pledged to pay whatever
liablities or obligations the commission deems they owe, after a
thorough search of their records and their archives.
	   At issue are the claims of thousands of Holocaust survivors and
thousands more of the families of those who died in the Holocaust,
who charge that insurance companies refused to honor policies after
the war.
	   The companies _ Allianz of Germany, Axa of France, and Generali
of Italy, and Zurich Financial Services Group, Winterthur Swiss
Insurance Co., and Baloise Insurance Group of Switzerland _ put up
a further dlrs 10 million for the work of the international
commission.
	   ``These payments are to be understood as a commitment that the
companies stand behind the commission,'' Philipp Senn, Baloise
spokesman, said Thursday in Geneva.
	   He said several working groups were formed, one of which was to
work out a procedure for verifying the claims of Holocaust victims.
	   In addition to the insurance companies and European insurance
regulators, the commission includes representatives of the World
Jewish Congress, the World Jewish Restitution Organization, the
state of Israel, and U.S. insurance regulators. Lawrence
Eagleburger, the former U.S. secretary of state, is commission
chairman.
	   Steinberg said the humanitarian fund would be used as decided by
the commission.
	   The insurance companies have not disclosed what share each firm
is to pay, but it may vary according to how much related business
they had during the Holocaust.

Russia expects to begin receiving E.U. food aid in January
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: RECASTS lede; ADDS estimate of total Russian foreign debt in
8th graf. &QL;

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will seek a second restructuring of its
Soviet-era debt, a deputy finance minister said, a move likely to
further undermine the government's sullied reputation among foreign
creditors.
	   The announcement, though not surprising, was another blow to
Russia's crumbling economy.
	   Meanwhile, Russian officials bracing for a harsh winter were on
the verge of signing a food aid deal with the European Union that
would start providing wheat, rice, beef and pork in early January.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said in an interview
published Thursday that Russia would be asking creditors for some
``breathing space on the payments of the debt in the next year or
two.''
	   The Soviet-debt payments are part of dlrs 17.5 billion in
foreign debt that Russia was to pay creditors next year.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov has said the
government was seeking to reschedule the payments, but he did not
specify whether it would restructure Russian or Soviet debt.
	   Foreign lenders expected the government to try to pay off the
newer, Russian debt first, and Kasyanov's announcement, in an
interview with the business daily Kommersant, confirmed the
speculations. Kasyanov did not rule out the possibility that the
government would want to reschedule the Russian debt as well.
	   Russia inherited about dlrs 100 billion in total Soviet debt in
1991, and dlrs 160 billion in non-performing loans the Soviet Union
had made to developing countries. Since the Soviet collapse, Russia
has built up another dlrs 140 billion in foreign debt, according to
some estimates.
	   Under a 1996 Paris Club agreement, Russia was granted a grace
period on the Soviet debt through 2002, during which it only has to
make debt service payments.
	   ``Rescheduling previously rescheduled debt is not good news,''
Charles Blitzer, an economist with the Donaldson, Lufkin and
Jenrette investment bank in London, said Thursday. ``It ... is not
a good sign.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Gennady Kulik said Thursday that Russia
expects to wrap up the EU food aid deal soon and should begin
receiving it in January.
	   The Russian government last week signed a separate food aid
agreement with the United States as part of an effort to ensure
that stockpiles last until the spring.
	   The EU package is expected to be worth about dlrs 480 million
and consist of 1 million metric tons (1.1 million tons) of wheat,
and smaller amounts of rye, rice, pork, beef and vegetable oils.
	   Russia has not experienced any serious food shortages so far,
but the government doesn't want to risk getting caught short in the
middle of winter, when deliveries to remote areas are difficult and
expensive.
	   In a new sign of trouble for the Russian banks, Central Bank
Chairman Viktor Gerashchenko said the government won't bail out
domestic banks whose overseas assets are frozen by foreign
creditors.
	   A government-declared moratorium on debt payments that had
protected Russian banks is due to expire within days.
	   Central Bank's deputy chairman Andrei Kozlov said that more than
700 Russian commercial banks will fail, because the government does
not have the 80 billion rubles (dlrs 5 billion) to save them.
	   The banks hold 32 percent of all private deposits in the
country, the Interfax news agency reported. Many private bank
accounts have been frozen since Russia devalued the ruble and froze
some of its debts in August.
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov struck a similar tone Wednesday
when he said the government would not guarantee private deposits in
commercial banks.
	   ``We live in a market economy,'' he said, according to the
Interfax news agency. ``If Russians want guarantees, they should
put their money in Sberbank,'' the national savings bank.

	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac, starting a
visit to Mexico, promised Thursday that his country will help
Mexico improve its economic and cultural ties with the European
Community.
	   ``France will help you on the road that leads you to Europe,''
Chirac said in a speech to Mexico's Congress, where he received
frequent applause.
	   Chirac, his wife Bernadette and a delegation of 50 officials and
businessmen arrived around midnight on the first step of a trip
that will also take him to the hurricane-devastated countries of
Central America.
	   The disaster of Hurricane Mitch, which killed nearly 10,000
people in Honduras and Nicaragua, almost overshadowed the long-term
issues of Franco-Mexican relations.
	   ``I want to express the profound emotion that France feels at
the tragedy inflicted by Hurricane Mitch on Mexico's neighbor
countries,'' Chirac said at the welcoming ceremony at Mexico City's
military parade ground, the Campo Marte.
	   Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo in turn said Mexico was
``moved by France's decision to come to the help of our Central
American brothers'' with aid and relief of debts for those
countries.

Chile approves search for suspected treasury at Robinson Crusoe
</HEADLINE>
Island &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chilean authorities have authorized a
U.S. expedition to search the Robinson Crusoe archipelago for what
is believed to be an 18th-century pirate treasure.
	   The unidentified Americans used satellite data to locate the
site where the treasure of English pirate Frances Drake is believed
to be, archipelago Mayor Leopoldo Gonzalez said Thursday.
	   ``For years, it has been believed that pirate Drake buried
valuable bounties here that he robbed from Chilean cities and from
Spanish vessels,'' Mayor Gonzalez said in a telephone interview.
	   The three-island archipelago, 800 kilometers (500 miles) west of
mainland Chile, is a national park.
	   The National Monuments Commission confirmed Thursday that it
authorized ``scientific and archaeological diggings aimed at
finding the exact place were a valuable shipment was buried in the
18th century.''
	   Should a treasure be found, the Chilean government would keep 75
percent and the foreign expedition would get the remaining 25
percent, the Commission said. Chilean scientists will accompany the
Americans to ensure the exploration respects scientific and legal
norms.
	   The site is about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the
Archipelago's only populated village.

Israeli ambassador protests Communist's anti-Semitic attacks

Russians wouldn't approve of a Jew for president, other details.

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Less than a decade after it abolished Soviet-era
discrimination against Jews, Russia is dealing with an ugly spate
of grassroots anti-Semitism.
	   Many prominent Russians have denounced recent anti-Semitic slurs
by a Communist lawmaker, but a poll released Thursday indicated 64
percent of Russians do not want to see a Jew as president.
	   Israeli Ambassador Zvi Magen met with Communist Party leader
Gennady Zyuganov on Thursday to protest attacks by the Communist
lawmaker, Albert Makashov.
	   ``These remarks are an insult and a challenge to the entire
nation,'' Magen said after the meeting, according to the Interfax
news agency.
	   He said Zyuganov denounced the slurs _ for the first time since
the uproar began last month _ and promised to do everything
possible to condemn such actions.
	   ``We consider Makashov's statements inappropriate, unrestrained
and incorrect,'' Zyuganov later told reporters in parliament.
	   ``The basis of our policy is friendship and respect for a man of
any nationality, and this policy will be pursued by the party
continuously and firmly,'' Zyuganov said. ``We won't allow anybody
to push our country to internecine war.''
	   The Communist leader has made similar proclamations before _ in
the meantime asserting in his writings that Jews control the
world's economic systems and marching side-by-side with his overtly
anti-Semitic allies during demonstrations.
	   Russia has a history of discriminating against Jews dating back
to czarist times, and the Soviet government imposed restrictions on
Jewish culture, job advancement and university education. The
discrimination _ which is based more on ethnicity than religion
here _ prompted waves of Russian Jews to emigrate.
	   Since the Soviet-era restrictions were lifted, anti-Semitic
feelings have remained widespread, if muted.
	   But they have been spilling out since Russia plunged into its
latest economic troubles.
	   In speeches last month, Makashov, a retired general, blamed the
country's problems on ``zhidy,'' or ``yids,'' a derogatory term for
Jews.
	   Communists in parliament blocked a resolution condemning
Makashov's comments, and several of his Communist colleagues
defended him in speeches last weekend celebrating the 81st
anniversary of the 1917 Russian revolution, which brought the
Communist Party to power.
	   Makashov was at it again this week, telling the Italian
newspaper La Stampa that he wants quotas introduced on the number
of Jews in Russia's state organizations.
	   Zyuganov refused to comment on the call for quotas.
	   Several prominent Russian businessmen and politicians have
called for banning the Communist Party because it would not censure
Makashov.
	   Yet in a poll of 1,500 Moscow residents carried out by the
independent All-Russian Public Opinion Research Center, a leading
Russian polling service, 64 percent said they would not approve of
a Jew as Russian president.
	   Another 21 percent said they would approve, and 15 percent were
undecided, according to the poll, conducted over the past few days
and published Thursday by the daily Kommersant. It gave no margin
of error.
	   President Boris Yeltsin on Thursday scolded his government for a
slow response to ``ethnic and political extremism'' and urged
Prosecutor General Yuri Skuratov and other law enforcement
officials to be more resolute in combating ethnic extremism, the
Kremlin said in a statement.
	   ``We can't allow extremists to throw the nation into chaos and
social upheavals,'' Yeltsin said.
	   Skuratov's office has launched an investigation into Makashov's
remarks.
	   Statements that ``incite ethnic strife'' are punishable under
Russia's post-Soviet constitution, but few people have been
punished for making such remarks.
	   Besides, Makashov enjoys immunity as a lawmaker, and if
authorities try to waive it, his colleagues in parliament are
likely to block the move.

Torre voted American League Manager of the Year

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Joe Torre was overwhelmingly voted American
League Manager of the Year on Thursday after leading the New York
Yankees to one of the most successful seasons in U.S. baseball
history.
	   Torre, who tied Texas' Johnny Oates for the award two years ago,
got 23 first-place votes, four seconds and one third for 128 points
in voting by the Baseball Writers' Association of America.
	   ``After winning the World Series, this is obviously a tremendous
honor because the people who vote for this follow baseball on a
day-to-day basis,'' Torre said.
	   Boston's Jimy Williams was a distant second with three firsts,
12 seconds and eight thirds for 59 points, and Anaheim's Terry
Collins was third with two firsts, seven seconds and seven thirds
for 38 points.
	   Oates was fourth with 11 points, followed Cleveland's Mike
Hargrove (8). Toronto's Tim Johnson was tied for sixth with
Chicago's Jerry Manuel (4 each).
	   ``You don't expect anything,'' Torre said. ``A lot of managers,
because they have a good team, don't necessarily get this award.''
	   Torre, who led the Yankees to their second World Series title in
his three seasons with them, also won The Associated Press Manager
of the Year award last week.
	   New York finished the regular season 114-48, setting an AL
record for wins. The Yankees went 11-2 in the postseason, capping
the year by sweeping the San Diego Padres in the World Series. At
125-50, they had the most combined regular and postseason wins
ever.
	   ``What makes me a good manager is pretty good players,'' Torre
said. ``You can't win the Derby on a quarterhorse. We have quality
here and quality with a lot of heart.''
	   Yankees owner George Steinbrenner is close to giving Torre a
two-year contract extension through 2001.
	   ``Joe has done an outstanding job for the Yankees and we have a
great rapport,'' Steinbrenner said. ``This has been a great
association.''

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ Signaling changed attitudes across the Arab
world, eight Arab foreign ministers declared Thursday that Iraq
would be ``held responsible for any consequences'' from its
stopping the work of U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   The diplomatic phrase was the clearest sign yet of a remarkable
reversal in Arab sentiments amid signs that a U.S. military strike
may be imminent.
	   During a similar standoff over U.N. inspections in February, the
Arab world was outraged at the prospect of a U.S. attack.
	   At that time, hundreds of Palestinians paraded a model of an
Iraqi Scud missile and chanted ``Beloved Saddam, Hit Tel Aviv.''
Yemenis jumped off buses to join anti-American protests, and in
Jordan, police had to use attack dogs to keep demonstrators at bay.
	   The mood is far different today. Rather than anger, a sense of
resignation prevails.
	   ``Kuwait cannot stop a superpower from taking certain steps,''
said Kuwaiti foreign minister, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmed al-Sabah, after
the meeting in Doha, Qatar, of foreign ministers from Syria and
Egypt as well as six Gulf states: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, the
United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia.
	   Twenty-five more U.N. employees left Iraq on Thursday, joining
233 U.N. inspectors and relief workers who departed a day earlier.
And few in the region believe Iraq is prepared to back down from
its Oct. 31 decision to end the inspections.
	   ``The question now is what will this strike be like? What will
its size be and what will be the end?'' asked columnist Abdullah
al-Shayegi in Kuwait's Al-Watan newspaper Thursday.
	   That perception was echoed in Al-Wafd, one of Egypt's most
popular newspapers, whose banner headline Thursday read, ``The
countdown begins for the strike on Iraq.''
	   In the statement after the meeting Thursday _ a declaration that
was praised by the United States _ the foreign ministers expressed
hope that ``wisdom and reason prevail'' so as not to worsen
hardships for already miserable Iraqis.
	   The call has been echoed in the statements of nearly all Arab
countries since the buildup began. But diplomatic efforts seems to
be less active than during the last crisis.
	   Then, Arab League Secretary-General Esmat Abdel-Meguid took the
unusual step of flying to the Iraqi capital to meet President
Saddam Hussein in a show of solidarity. This time, from Cairo, he
urged the Iraqis to show ``flexibility.''
	   The softer tones in Arab capitals may not be coincidental.
	   Some Arab diplomats have said U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen told leaders on his tour this month of the Gulf as well as
Egypt and Jordan, that if the governments did not agree with an
attack, they should keep the criticism to themselves.
	   Resentment remains, though, at what many Arabs see as the double
standard in Washington's prosecution of the sanctions against Iraq
and its patience with Israel in the peace process.
	   ``This duplicity in American policy, the flagrant hostility to
Arab rights and the extreme bias in favor of Israel has proven that
the American administration has no credibility,'' said Tishrin, a
Syrian newspaper that speaks for the government.

Five inmates escape from Russian prison

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Five inmates escaped from a Russian prison through
a hole in a brick wall, a news report said Thursday.
	   One of the escapees was caught soon afterward in the city of
Leninsk in southern Russia, but the other four were still at large,
a police spokesman said Thursday, according to the ITAR-Tass news
agency.
	   The prison is in the Volgograd region near Leninsk, about 900
kilometers (550 miles) southeast of Moscow.
	   The report did not say when the prisoners escaped or what they
were imprisoned for, or give any other details of the escape.

Carlos's family blames France for provoking hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The family of the terrorist known as
Carlos the Jackal said Thursday that France is largely to blame for
his nine-day hunger strike in a Paris prison.
	   The Venezuelan-born Illich Ramirez Sanchez, 49, once one of the
world's most wanted terrorists, is angry because authorities have
kept him in solitary confinement for four months, confiscated
letters sent to him and blocked him from taking French classes, his
brother said.
	   ``We aren't asking for preferential treatment. We simply ask
that (his) human rights be respected,'' Vladimir Ramirez Sanchez
told reporters.
	   His brother has refused food and water since Nov. 3 because of
alleged mistreatment at La Sante prison, where he is serving a life
sentence for the 1975 murders of two French investigators and a
Lebanese national.
	   Venezuela's ambassador to France, Francisco Kerdel Vegas, who is
a doctor, visited Ramirez in prison and confirmed that his health
is deteriorating dangerously, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said.
	   ``If my brother dies, the only one responsible will be the
government of France,'' said Vladimir Ramirez, adding that Carlos
is ``prepared to die.''
	   The Venezuelan government has asked France to ensure that
Ramirez's rights are respected _ a request the French are
reviewing, according to Venezuela's Foreign Ministry. France has
not commented publicly.
	   Ramirez was linked to the spectacular 1975 seizure of OPEC
ministers in Vienna, Austria, and the 1976 hijacking of an Air
France jet to Uganda. French agents snared him in Khartoum, Sudan,
on Aug. 15, 1994, and then hauled him to Paris in a sack.

 &UR; Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Hundreds of jittery British tourists
broke off their holiday at a southern resort Thursday and Israel
opened gas mask distribution centers for its citizens as the
U.S.-Iraq showdown over weapons inspections intensified.
	   However Israeli officials said they believed the possibility of
an Iraqi retaliatory attack on Israel, as was the case during the
1991 Gulf War, was slim and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
he wasn't even sure if he had a gas mask at home.
	   Netanyahu stressed that Israel does not want to be part of what
he termed as ``a real crisis,'' over United Nations weapons
inspections but wasn't taking any chances.
	   ``We have to take the necessary precautions,'' he told
reporters.
	   For Israelis, it was the third time in one year that they have
been asked to prepare for the possibility of an attack. But unlike
during tense flare-ups last November and in February, the general
public seemed to be taking a wait-and-see approach Thursday.
	   ``I think people are very much weathered by the whole thing.
It's been like a cry-wolf scenario for a year and we can't know
what will happen,'' said Amber Landeau, a 25 year-old from Tel
Aviv.
	   In February, panic-stricken Israelis rushed to exchange gas
masks for newer models with fresh filters. Fighting broke out at
several centers over protective gear for infants. There was a
shortage of plastic sheeting used for sealing rooms against
chemical or biological weapons and Israeli pharmaceutical companies
began manufacturing antidotes.
	   Thursday, only a trickle of people showed up at the 65 gas mask
centers opened around the country.
	   ``My daughter persuaded me to go,'' said Ariel Schindler, 83, as
he prepared to go inside.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States to
exercise restraint Thursday and avoid striking at Iraq, a move he
said would be detrimental to the Mideast peace process. he said he
had sent an envoy to Baghdad to help mediate the situation.
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that an attack on a
fellow Arab nation by the current sponsor of the Mideast peace
process could ignite popular street support and place Arafat in a
difficult position.
	   A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
did not rule out Thursday the possibility that Saddam would strike
at the Jewish state again if attacked by the U.S.
	   But the prime minister's office downplayed the possibility.
	   ``We feel that the chances of any kind of attack are ... close
to zero, but as long as there is any possibility at all, we have to
be prepared,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, some 600 British tourists prepared to leave the Red
Sea resort of Eilat after the British government issued a travel
warning to its citizens in the area due to the Gulf crisis.
	   The United States and Canada issued similar travel advisories to
its citizens as well. Israel's tourism minister, Moshe Katsav
sharply criticized the move, calling it ``rash, harmful and
superfluous.'' he said Israel would distribute masks to tourists
should the need arise.

Facing military threat, Iraq blames Washington for crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Facing a U.S. military build-up and harsh
criticism from fellow Arabs, Iraq on Thursday blamed Washington for
the deepening crisis over U.N. arms inspections and said an
American attack would be ``a sheer aggression of criminals.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz _ his voice rising in anger _
charged that President Clinton was blocking the completion of arms
inspections necessary for the lifting of punishing trade sanctions
on Iraq.
	   ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally
by his government'' Aziz told a news conference that came shortly
after eight Arab states said Iraq itself would be at fault if the
U.S. military struck at the country.
	   The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation
Council _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _ along with Syria and Egypt
was unusually strong for Arab countries who have repeatedly called
for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   Foreign ministers of the eight states, meeting in the Gulf state
of Qatar, did urge ``wisdom and reason'' to end the confrontation.
But they said the government of President Saddam Hussein would be
``responsible for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Aziz gave little heed to the plea from the Arabs to renew
cooperation with the United Nations or face more suffering by the
Iraqi people.
	   ``If they are sincere in dealing with this situation ... they
should blame the main block, the main government which is behind
this crisis. They should criticize the United States,'' he said.
	   Iraq's defiant stand came despite growing evidence that the
United States was preparing to make good on its military threats
unless searches for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are renewed.
	   The United States on Wednesday ordered more warships headed to
the Gulf to ready for an attack, and the United Nations _ declaring
it must look to the safety of its workers _ pulled 21 more of its
staff out of Iraq on Thursday.
	   The U.N. pullback began Wednesday. All arms inspectors and a
third of the 450 U.N. humanitarian workers have now left the
country, with the departure of aid workers likely reducing the
effectiveness of programs to help Iraq's 22 million people.
	   At his news conference, Aziz said Iraq was willing to cooperate
with arms inspectors, but only if it had guarantees from the U.N.
Security Council that this would lead to lifting sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   He accused the Clinton administration of undermining a U.N.
offer of a comprehensive review of the arms inspections _ as one
step toward lifting the sanctions _ by refusing to include even a
reference to the eight-year-old trade embargo.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Aziz complained that after more than seven years of working with
U.N. inspectors, ``sanctions were not reduced and were not
lifted.''
	   ``Why?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Because the government of Mr.
Clinton has blocked any attempt during this period to reduce and
lift sanctions. He and his government are the problem, not Iraq.''
	   Aziz questioned whether the United States had the right to
attack.
	   ``Is that in the U.N. resolutions?'' he asked. ``Is that
international law? Is that a ... a humanitarian mission to be
conducted by a government? Or is it a sheer aggression of
criminals?''
	   He also said Iraq's people were not worried about a possible
military strike.
	   ``They are dying whether in a hospital which lacks medicine and
equipment or they die by American bombs,'' he said. ``For the Iraqi
people it makes no difference.''
	   Aziz said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the best
person'' to try to ease the current crisis, as he did the last one
in February with a pledge to work toward an end to the sanctions.
	   The United States had built up forces in the Gulf in February,
too, but that stand-off ended when Iraq backed down from its
insistence that U.N. experts could not inspect Saddam's
presidential palaces.
	   In August, seeing no signs of the sanctions being lifted, Iraq
again limited the work of arms inspectors and on Oct. 31 it cut off
even the long-term monitoring intended to prevent the Iraqi
government from renewing weapons production.
	   That brought a Security Council condemnation and a renewal of
U.S. threats of a military strike. Britain has backed Washington in
the Security Council, and Iraq's usual allies _ China, France and
Russia _ have not been outspoken in defending the Iraqi government.

New dinosaur species found in Africa

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It was a monster dinosaur built for catching
fish, with razor teeth, a long snout and foot-long curved claws
that could hook and hold the big ones.
	   Researchers who found the fossil of this 36-foot-long (10
meters) animal believe it is a previously unknown species big
enough and mean enough to have dominated its world 100 million
years ago.
	   The new species, to be called Suchomimus tenerensis, ``was an
impressive-sized beast,'' said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago
paleontologist who found the fossils last year in Africa.
	   ``If you were standing next to it, your eye level would be at
its knee,'' Sereno said at a news conference at National Geographic
headquarters Thursday. ``This animal was easily the size of
Tyrannosaurus rex. And it was not fully grown.''
	   Suchomimus apparently was a fish eater, said Sereno, but it
could threaten virtually anything around it.
	   ``With its forearms and its jaws, it would have been able to
take down just about anything,'' Sereno said. ``It was the dominant
predator of its time.''
	   The animal was generally shaped like the T. rex, with two large
hind legs, a powerful tail, forearms and a toothy head, Sereno said
in a study being published Friday in the journal Science.
	   But Suchomimus was a member of a group of animals called
spinosaurids that lived in the lands that became Africa, Europe and
South America between 90 million and 120 million years ago. At that
time, T. rex was just emerging in North America.
	   The discovery ``provides important new insights on the evolution
and adaptation'' of the spinosaur group of dinosaurs, said Thomas
R. Holtz Jr., a University of Maryland researcher.
	   The fossil was found in Niger, a central African country on the
southwestern edge of the Sahara. In the dinosaur era, the area
``was a lush climate that could support many different species of
dinosaurs,'' Sereno said.
	   The animal's most distinctive feature is its long, pointed jaw,
armed with about 100 teeth. The end of the jaw is tipped with an
extra chin-like projection, called a rosette, that actually
contains the largest teeth. The top and bottom teeth mesh together
to securely hook prey, a design common among fish-eating animals.
	   ``The jaw is really very much like a crocodile's,'' Sereno said.
``It was built for snaring and swallowing.''
	   Suchomimus' teeth also are typical of fish-eating crocodiles,
lightly curved and hooked and not designed for chewing.
	   The animal's thumbs were about 16 inches (40 cm) long and tipped
with 12-inch (30cm) claws curved like a sickle. The two fingers on
each hand had shorter, curved claws.
	   ``The hand is amazing,'' Sereno said. ``It was probably ideal
for fishing, for grabbing ... into those large fish.''
	   It's not known how the newly discovered Suchomimus died, but it
apparently was swept into a river, rolled over and over and was
then buried by soil. When found in extreme desert, wind had eroded
the sands that had covered it for 100 million years.

<TEXT>
	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The president of a top professional
soccer team is being held for questioning on suspicion he
participated in kidnapping and setting up right-wing paramilitary
groups, prosecutors said Thursday.
	   Gustavo Upegui of the first division Envigado club was detained
Wednesday at the team's offices located near Medellin, Colombia's
second largest city. Prosecutors said they would decide within ten
days whether to charge or release him.
	   Police sources have said Upegui is a leading drug trafficker as
well, but prosecutors offered no details on any of the alleged
crimes for which Upegui was being questioned.
	   Colombian soccer executives, coaches and players have been
implicated in numerous criminal probes, mainly into the influence
of drug money on the sport. Until recently, drug traffickers owned
many of the top professional teams.
	   A former president of the national soccer league, Juan Jose
Bellini, was released from prison last month after completing half
of a six year term for illegal enrichment from drug trafficking.
	   Prosecutors have also summoned Francisco Maturana, a Colombian
who coached his country's World Cup teams in Italy and United
States and now coaches Costa Rica, for questioning about allegedly
receiving payoffs from the Cali drug cartel.

 &UR; Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Hundreds of jittery British tourists
broke off their holiday at a southern resort Thursday and Israel
opened gas mask distribution centers for its citizens as the
U.S.-Iraq showdown over weapons inspections intensified.
	   However Israeli officials said they believed the possibility of
an Iraqi retaliatory attack on Israel, as was the case during the
1991 Gulf War, was slim and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
he wasn't even sure if he had a gas mask at home.
	   Netanyahu stressed that Israel does not want to be part of what
he termed as ``a real crisis'' over United Nations weapons
inspections but wasn't taking any chances.
	   ``We have to take the necessary precautions,'' he told
reporters.
	   For Israelis, it was the third time in one year that they have
been asked to prepare for the possibility of an attack. But unlike
during tense flare-ups last November and in February, the general
public seemed to be taking a wait-and-see approach Thursday.
	   ``I think people are very much weathered by the whole thing.
It's been like a cry-wolf scenario for a year and we can't know
what will happen,'' said Amber Landeau, a 25 year-old from Tel
Aviv.
	   In February, panic-stricken Israelis rushed to exchange gas
masks for newer models with fresh filters. Fighting broke out at
several centers over protective gear for infants. There was a
shortage of plastic sheeting used for sealing rooms against
chemical or biological weapons and Israeli pharmaceutical companies
began manufacturing antidotes.
	   But February's Iraq crisis ultimately was defused after U.N.
General-Secretary Kofi Annan secured a commitment from Baghdad to
allow U.N.-mandated weapons inspections of Iraq to continue.
	   Thursday, only a trickle of people showed up at the 65 gas mask
centers opened around the country.
	   ``My daughter persuaded me to go,'' said Ariel Schindler, 83, as
he prepared to go inside.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States to
exercise restraint Thursday and avoid striking at Iraq, a move he
said would be detrimental to the Mideast peace process. He said he
had sent an envoy to Baghdad to help mediate the situation.
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that an attack on a
fellow Arab nation by the current sponsor of the Mideast peace
process could ignite popular street support and place Arafat in a
difficult position.
	   A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
did not rule out Thursday the possibility that Saddam would strike
at the Jewish state again if attacked by the United States.
	   But the prime minister's office downplayed the possibility.
	   ``We feel that the chances of any kind of attack are ... close
to zero, but as long as there is any possibility at all, we have to
be prepared,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, some 600 British tourists prepared to leave the Red
Sea resort of Eilat after the British government issued a travel
warning to its citizens in the area due to the Gulf crisis.
	   The United States and Canada issued similar travel advisories to
its citizens as well. Israel's tourism minister, Moshe Katsav
sharply criticized the move, calling it ``rash, harmful and
superfluous.'' he said Israel would distribute masks to tourists
should the need arise.

Burks returns to Giants for dlrs 10 million, two-year deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SAN FRANCISCO (AP) _ Ellis Burks decided to stay with the San
Francisco Giants, agreeing on Thursday to a dlrs 10 million,
two-year contract.
	   Burks, a 34-year-old outfielder, was acquired by San Francisco
from Colorado on July 31 for Darryl Hamilton. Coming off a dlrs 9.1
million, two-year contract, Burks gets dlrs 4.5 million next season
and dlrs 5.5 million in 2000.
	   ``Today's signing of Ellis Burks has significantly improved our
run-producing capabilities,'' Giants general manager Brian Sabean
said. ``As we all witnessed late last season, Ellis really changes
the look of our lineup.''
	   The two-time All-Star hit .292 with 21 homers and 76 RBIs this
season. With the Giants, he batted .306 with five homers and 22
RBIs.
	   Burks played with injured knees this year and had surgery after
the season _ Sept. 30 on his left knee and Oct. 28 on his right.
	   ``We can expect him to play even a more prominent role for us,
both at the plate and in the field,'' Sabean said.
	   Burks, with a .290 career average, 230 homers and 820 RBIs, was
the second free agent to re-sign with the Giants. Pitcher Mark
Gardner agreed to a dlrs 5 million, two-year deal.
	   Hamilton agreed last week to a dlrs 10.5 million, three-year
contract with the Rockies.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of ethnic Albanian hostages
were released late Thursday, after Serb civilians took them hostage
early in the day, Serb sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Kosovo Albanian
leadership, first said 20 ethnic Albanians were abducted. Later, it
said up to 100 were taken hostage. The figures could not be
independently confirmed.
	   The Serb abductors were seeking the release of two fellow Serbs
who went missing Wednesday in the central Drenica region. The
Kosovo Information Center said some of those detained were
threatened with ``liquidation'' unless the two Serbs were released.
	   The ethnic Albanians were reportedly taken off a bus to the
village of Crnac, 50 kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Pristina.
	   Late Thursday, the Serb Media Center, close to the Serbian
government, reported all of the hostages had been released. No
further information was available and the report could not be
independently confirmed.

Facing military threat, Iraq blames Washington for crisis

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Facing a U.S. military buildup and harsh
criticism from fellow Arabs, Iraq on Thursday blamed Washington for
the deepening crisis over U.N. arms inspections and said an
American attack would be ``a sheer aggression of criminals.''
	   Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz _ his voice rising in anger _
charged that President Bill Clinton was blocking the completion of
arms inspections necessary for the lifting of punishing trade
sanctions on Iraq.
	   ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally
by his government,'' Aziz told a news conference that came shortly
after eight Arab states said Iraq itself would be at fault if the
U.S. military struck at the country.
	   The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation
Council _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _ along with Syria and Egypt
was unusually strong for Arab countries who have repeatedly called
for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   Foreign ministers of the eight states, meeting in the Gulf state
of Qatar, did urge ``wisdom and reason'' to end the confrontation.
But they said the government of President Saddam Hussein would be
``responsible for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Aziz gave little heed to the plea from the Arabs to renew
cooperation with the United Nations or face more suffering by the
Iraqi people.
	   ``If they are sincere in dealing with this situation ... they
should blame the main block, the main government which is behind
this crisis. They should criticize the United States,'' he said.
	   Iraq's defiant stand came despite growing evidence that the
United States was preparing to make good on its military threats
unless searches for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are renewed.
	   The United States on Wednesday ordered more warships headed to
the Gulf to ready for an attack, and the United Nations _ declaring
it must look to the safety of its workers _ pulled 21 more of its
staff out of Iraq on Thursday.
	   The U.N. pullback began Wednesday. All arms inspectors and a
third of the 450 U.N. humanitarian workers have now left the
country, with the departure of aid workers likely reducing the
effectiveness of programs to help Iraq's 22 million people.
	   At his news conference, Aziz said Iraq was willing to cooperate
with arms inspectors, but only if it had guarantees from the U.N.
Security Council that this would lead to lifting sanctions imposed
after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
	   He accused the Clinton administration of undermining a U.N.
offer of a comprehensive review of the arms inspections _ as one
step toward lifting the sanctions _ by refusing to include even a
reference to the eight-year-old trade embargo.
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War over Kuwait.
	   Aziz complained that after more than seven years of working with
U.N. inspectors, ``sanctions were not reduced and were not
lifted.''
	   ``Why?'' he asked rhetorically. ``Because the government of Mr.
Clinton has blocked any attempt during this period to reduce and
lift sanctions. He and his government are the problem, not Iraq.''
	   Aziz questioned whether the United States had the right to
attack.
	   ``Is that in the U.N. resolutions?'' he asked. ``Is that
international law? Is that a ... a humanitarian mission to be
conducted by a government? Or is it a sheer aggression of
criminals?''
	   He also said Iraq's people were not worried about a possible
military strike.
	   ``They are dying whether in a hospital which lacks medicine and
equipment or they die by American bombs,'' he said. ``For the Iraqi
people it makes no difference.''
	   Aziz said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the best
person'' to try to ease the current crisis, as he did the last one
in February with a pledge to work toward an end to the sanctions.
	   The United States had built up forces in the Gulf in February,
too, but that stand-off ended when Iraq backed down from its
insistence that U.N. experts could not inspect Saddam's
presidential palaces.
	   In August, seeing no signs of the sanctions being lifted, Iraq
again limited the work of arms inspectors and on Oct. 31 it cut off
even the long-term monitoring intended to prevent the Iraqi
government from renewing weapons production.
	   That brought a Security Council condemnation and a renewal of
U.S. threats of a military strike. Britain has backed Washington in
the Security Council, and Iraq's usual allies _ China, France and
Russia _ have not been outspoken in defending the Iraqi government.

Rusedski joins Nestor in quarterfinals
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with last two matches &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Big-serving Greg Rusedski was broken
for the first time in the tournament, but held on for a relatively
easy 6-1, 6-4 victory over American Vince Spadea in the Stockholm
Open on Thursday.
	   The Briton's win set up the first ever quarterfinal between two
Canadian-born players in the tournament, one of the world's oldest
indoors.
	   Rusedski, the winningest indoor player this year with 31
victories, will face Daniel Nestor in Friday's quarterfinals.
	   Nestor, ranked only 115th in the world, eliminated Cedric
Pioline 6-3, 3-6, 6-3 in Thursday's first second-round match at the
Royal Tennis Hall.
	   The sixth-seeded Frenchman's exit left only three of the eight
seeds left in the tournament.
	   Nestor's win came less than 24 hours after Aussie Jason
Stoltenberg upset world No 1 Pete Sampras in a first-rund match.
Other seeded players who have lost include Karol Kucera (2),
defending champion Jonas Bjorkman (5) and former two-time Stockholm
Open winner Thomas Enqvist (8).
	   Thomas Johansson, another Swede seeded No. 7, had an easy 6-2,
6-1 win over American qualifier Geoff Grant and will next meet
Stoltenberg, who breezed past Hendrik Dreekmann of Germany 6-2,
6-2.
	   ``I've never been in better shape,'' said Johansson, who has
moved to 18th on the ATP rankings and now is the highest ranked
Swedish player.
	   The fourth-seeded Rusedski, who beat Sampras in the Paris Open
final Sunday for his finest victory, has played better and better
in each of his three stops in Stockholm. Last year he was a
semifinalist.
	   ``But I'm just taking one step at a time,'' he said. ``I have a
difficult opponent tomorrow.''
	   Meeting a Canadian in the quarters doesn't mean Rusedski will be
extra motivated.
	   ``It won't be different than any other match,'' he said. ``I
played Daniel at Wimbledon in our last meeting and I won in three
straight sets. It's just going to be another match out there
really. I've known him since I was young and we both played a few
times in juniors as well. It's going to be a good match.''
	   Rusedski, who beat German Tommy Haas 6-1, 6-4 in his first match
Wednesday, was broken for the first time in the tournament at 3-3
in the second set when he hit a forehand volley wide.
	   Spadea had a 40-15 advantage in the next game. But Rusedski
broke him back to lead 4-3 and then held his serve the rest of the
way to close out the match in just over an hour after the American
had saved four match points in the last game.
	   ``Vince brought his level up in the second set,'' Rusedski said.
``He started serving better. He hit some returns. He started
picking my serve. He's a very dangerous player. He just goes for
broke. I knew the first-set result wasn't a true reflection of what
he can do on a tennis court.''
	   Pioline, a former U.S. Open and Wimbledon finalist who is 16th
on the ATP computer rankings, failed to take advantage of five
break points when tied at 2-2 in the decisive set.
	   Nestor finally held, firing an ace past Pioline and then hitting
another good first serve that the Frenchman couldn't return.
	   Both players then held their serves, but Pioline fell behind
15-40 in the eighth game. Pioline saved the first break point. But
Nestor capitalized on a lucky net cord on the second, Pioline's
return sailing long.
	   Nestor, who was only broken once in the match, then closed out
the set.

Governor ready to sign budget
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SALT LAKE CITY (AP) _ Mayor Deedee Corradini signed off on the
new dlrs 1.45 billion Olympic budget today and Gov. Mike Leavitt's
OK is expected after agreement on certain language with the Salt
Lake Organizing Committee.
	   Corradini announced her approval of the spending plan this
morning, saying it has adequate contingency plans, strategies for
maximizing reserves, calls for media housing close to downtown and
includes dlrs 3 million for ice sheets at Steiner Aquatics Center.
	   ``I am now confident that SLOC has created an excellent budget
that will allow it to stage the games with available funds,
reimburse the city for all services it requires and provide for the
best interests of the people of Salt Lake City,'' Corradini said.
	   Leavitt's spokeswoman Vicki Varela said an agreement between the
governor and SLOC might be signed today, or it could take until
Friday to finalize wording that reflects ``an accurate
representation of their expectations and the budget operations.''
	   ``What has been important to the governor from the beginning was
that SLOC didn't commit itself to expenditures in the first year of
the budget cycle that it wouldn't be able to support through the
Olympics,'' Varela said Wednesday. ``The most important thing to
the governor is that the budget balances in the end.''
	   Varela said the governor and SLOC have agreed to several key
points:
	   _No more than 60 percent of the budget, roughly dlrs 872
million, will be spent or committed before October, by which time
U.S. Olympic Committee fund-raiser John Krimsky has pledged to have
reached the sponsorship goal and another year of the federal budget
process will have been completed.
	   _At all times, SLOC will have contingency and reserve funds of
at least dlrs 100 million in the bank.
	   _If a SLOC project or activity comes in under budget, the
savings will be placed in a contingency fund rather than going back
to the department.
	   _SLOC's independent auditor, Deloitte Touche, will do
assessments twice a year to make sure revenues and expenditures are
on track.
	   _State Olympic Officer John Fowler, an auditor, will continue to
have continuous access to the books. The state also plans to do a
top-to-bottom budget review again next year.
	   Olympic organizers hope to present the budget to the IOC
Executive Board next month. The budget is subject to IOC review.

IMF rescue package could prompt new reduction in Brazil's interest

<TEXT>
	   SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) _ After lowering the key lending rate,
Brazil's government has turned its attention to a long-awaited
international rescue package that could prompt a further interest
rate cut to boost the sagging economy.
	   The Central Bank's Monetary Policy Committee lowered the annual
interest rate Wednesday night from 49.75 percent to 42.25 percent.
	   Brazil nearly doubled its key lending rate in September to halt
the flight of investors after Russia's August devaluation raised
fears of emerging markets. The country's foreign reserves have
since fallen to around dlrs 43 billion from dlrs 70 billion at the
end of July.
	   Capital flight continues, although at a slower pace.
	   After posting a massive net outflow of dlrs 21 billion in
September and October, Brazil's exchange market have lost a slimmer
dlrs 66 million this month.
	   The Central Bank's move was seen as ``modest and conservative''
by the powerful Brazilian Industry Confederation (CNI). In a
strongly worded statement released Thursday the confederation
warned that even after Wednesday night's reduction the country
needed additional cuts.
	   ``Keeping interest rates at their current levels turns the
current economic adjustment plan unviable,'' said Fernando Bezerra,
CNI's president.

Obesity, smoking may be responsible for rise in esophagus cancer
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LORI JOHNSTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ One type of cancer of the esophagus has increased
more than 350 percent among white men in the past 20 years, and
researchers say the reasons may include smoking and an increase in
obesity.
	   The study, released Thursday and published in the journal
Cancer, reported that annual cases of adenocarcinoma rose from 0.7
cases per 100,000 in 1974-76 to 3.2 cases per 100,000 in 1992-94.
	   Nearly 90 percent of patients with esophageal cancer die within
five years of contracting the disease.
	   The study, based on already existing national data, was
conducted by researchers from the National Cancer Institute and the
International Epidemiology Institute.
	   The researchers suggested one reason for the jump is an increase
in obesity among white men over 65, and perhaps smoking.
	   ``It goes back to prevention. This data all suggests that these
are tumors that can be prevented,'' said Dr. John S. Ensley, a
specialist at the Barbara Ann Karmanos Cancer Institute.
	   The study looked at two kinds of cancer of the esophagus, which
is the tube that carries food to the stomach.
	   Adenocarcinomas are tumors that are almost always found in
people with a condition known as Barrett's esophagus, in which the
normal lining of the esophagus is replaced by abnormal cells.
Barrett's esophagus occurs more often in overweight people, whose
esophaguses are more likely to be inflamed and constantly damaged
by stomach acid.
	   The study claimed smoking may be to blame as well, but the rate
of another esophagus cancer linked to smoking, squamous cell
carcinomas, has declined from 3.4 cases per 100,000 to 2.2 cases
per 100,000.
	   Adenocarcinoma rates in black males increased from 0.4 cases per
100,000 to 0.6 cases per 100,000. Squamous cell carcinoma rates
among blacks remained at 13.2 cases per 100,000, higher than whites
because of increased smoking among black men, the researchers said.
	   Among women of all races, cases of esophageal adenocarcinomas
rose from 0.1 to 0.4 cases per 100,000.

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel angered Palestinians Thursday by giving
the go-ahead for construction of a Jewish housing project in a
disputed area of Jerusalem, but also pledged to begin turning over
West Bank territory next week.
	   Dennis Ross, the United States special Middle East envoy, is to
arrive here Friday to oversee implementation of the nascent Mideast
land-for-security accord, and Palestinian officials were already
calling on him to help solve the latest disputes.
	   ``It is now crucial to have the American side join us ... to
oversee implementation of the agreement, '' said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Erekat. He told The Associated Press, ``We will not
accept any post-agreement negotiations and will not accept any
conditions outside,'' the accord itself, signed at the White House
Oct. 26.
	   The issuing of construction bids for the Har Homa housing
project sparked a minor row between Washington and Jerusalem.
	   White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart said the project was
``inconsistent with the spirit of the Wye agreement and with the
need to create a positive atmosphere'' for peace talks. U.S. State
Department Spokesman James Rubin called it ``a bad decision.''
	   In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office issued a
statement saying Rubin's comments ``should never have been made.''
	   ``The decision to build on Har Homa is a sovereign decision of
Israel. It has no connection to the Wye agreement,'' the statement
said.
	   Under the accord narrowly ratified by Netanyahu's Cabinet
Wednesday, Israel is to carry out a staged troop withdrawal from 13
percent of the West Bank in exchange for Palestinian security
measures.
	   Israel's plans to hand over the first parcel of land by the end
of next week, said David Bar-Illan, a senior adviser to Netanyahu.
And there were signs on the ground Thursday that implementation of
some aspects was close.
	   At the Palestinian airport in Gaza, near the Egyptian border,
Israeli and Palestinian officials drilled security procedures for
checking passengers.
	   Israeli soldiers were seen pulling equipment out of an army base
in the West Bank, near the Palestinian village of Dura. It was not
clear if the base is to be evacuated as part of the Israeli
redeployment.
	   However, Palestinians focused attention on Israel's decision to
accept bids for construction at a Jerusalem hilltop Israelis call
Har Homa and Palestinians know as Jabal Abu Ghneim. The hilltop is
part of land Israel captured from Jordan and annexed after the 1967
Mideast war. The Palestinians hope to establish the capital of a
future state in the area.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat called the project ``a big
obstacle,'' to peace, but stopped short of saying it would harm the
peace process.
	   Ground breaking there in January, 1997 for the 6,000 homes
planned for Jews, led to Palestinian rioting and a 19-month-long
stalemate in negotiations broken after Netanyahu and Arafat signed
the latest peace deal. Netanyahu has promised repeatedly the new
homes would be ready there in 2000.
	   Nabil Abourdeneh, an aide to Arafat, called the project and a
series of new Israeli conditions on the peace accord, ``a violation
of the ... agreement and of all agreements.''
	   Wednesday, Netanyahu warned that if the Palestinians go through
with a plan to unilaterally declare independence when the interim
peace accords expire in May, Israel will annex all West Bank
territory it still controls.
	   Arafat left the issue open, saying the issue of statehood could
be negotiated.
	   ``May 4 is the end of the five-year period we agreed upon in
Oslo. If there are other ideas, I'm ready to listen,'' Arafat was
quoted as saying.

	   GUATEMALA CITY (AP) _ Glowing clouds of gas and ash spewed from
the Santiaguito Volcano on Thursday and a small amount of lava
poured down the slopes of the mountain some 100 miles (60 kms) west
of the capital.
	   The 1,500-meter (5,000-foot) volcano began to erupt on
Wednesday, sending a cloud of ash some 1,000 meters (3,300-feet)
into the air. Local seismologists have said the volcano's activity
has not been highly explosive.
	   The volcano formed in 1920 on the southern flank of the older,
3,772-meter (12,448-foot) Santa Maria Volcano near the city of
Quetzaltenango.

	   BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) _ The president of a leading soccer team
is being held for questioning on suspicion he participated in
kidnapping and setting up right-wing paramilitary groups,
prosecutors said Thursday.
	   Gustavo Upegui of the first division Envigado club was detained
near Medellin, Colombia's second largest city. Prosecutors said
they would decide within ten days whether to charge or release him.
	   They gave no further details about Upegui's suspected
involvement in kidnapping or with the rightists militias.
	   Colombian soccer executives, coaches and players have been
implicated in numerous criminal investigations, mainly about the
influence of drug money on the sport. Until recently, drug
traffickers owned many of the top teams.
	   A former president of the national soccer league, Juan Jose
Bellini, was released from prison last month after completing half
of a six year term for illegal enrichment from drug trafficking.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ Federal officials have seized the private
security company that guards Cancun's international airport,
charging that it is linked to a major drug smuggling ring.
	   The federal attorney general's office announced late Wednesday
that the Lualti security company was seized Tuesday. It said the
owner, Tito Llanas Aguilar, is suspected of being a member of the
Juarez drug cartel in the southeastern resort town.
	   The agency said in a news release that the company apparently
kept track of authorities within the airport and reported on their
movements to drug traffickers. In addition to guards, the company
operates a closed-circuit television monitoring system.
	   An attorney for Llanas Aguilar was quoted Thursday by the Diario
de Yucatan as saying he had filed a court motion demanding that
officials justify the seizure. He said there was no arrest warrant
for his client.
	   Reports of drug trafficking in the Cancun region have increased
in recent years and officials have reported finding large amounts
of cocaine floating in the ocean off the Caribbean coast of
Quintana Roo state.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   GUADALAJARA, Mexico (AP) _ Police said Thursday they have
arrested two nightclub dancers suspected of killing a Peruvian
medical student, Max Williams Chanto Cruces.
	   The Jalisco state attorney general's office said Violeta Maria
Duenas Zamora, 28, and her sister Esmeralda, 16, admitted killing
Chanto Cruces, 23, on Oct. 24. His body was discovered two days
later in a river.
	   The dancers claimed that Chonta had come to their apartment and
tried to molest the younger sister. They said they responded by
clubbing him with a metal object and, when he died, dumping his
body.
	   Police said they also admitted that after the slaying, they had
gone to Chanto's house and robbed it.

Gap between races growing in heart disease deaths
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LORI JOHNSTON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ATLANTA (AP) _ The gap in the heart disease death rate between
blacks and whites has widened since the 1980s, the U.S. government
said Thursday.
	   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that in
the 35-to-44 age group, 38.2 blacks per 100,000 died of heart
disease each year from 1981 to 1985, compared with 24.3 whites.
	   By 1991-95, the black death rate had dropped to 26, but the
white rate had decreased as well, to 15.7. That is a ratio of 1.66
black deaths to one white death, compared with 1.58-to-1 in
1981-85.
	   The gap was even greater between black and white women: Twice as
many black women as white women ages 35 to 54 died of heart disease
between 1991 and 1995.
	   The CDC researchers blamed a higher prevalence of risk factors
among blacks such as smoking, diet and diabetes. They said the
disparity also could reflect genetic and biological differences as
well as less access to medical care.
	   Although death rates began to even out in people older than 65,
there were differences in all younger age groups.
	   The gap for people ages 45 to 54 went from 1.34 black deaths for
each white death in 1981-85 to 1.54-to-1 in 1991-95. In the
55-to-64 age group, the black-to-white death ratio went from
1.22-to-1 to 1.34-to-1.

Carlos's family blames France for provoking hunger strike
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) _ The family of the terrorist known as
Carlos the Jackal said Thursday that France is largely to blame for
his nine-day hunger strike in a Paris prison.
	   The Venezuelan-born Illich Ramirez Sanchez, 49, once one of the
world's most wanted terrorists, is angry because authorities have
kept him in solitary confinement for four months, confiscated
letters sent to him and blocked him from taking French classes, his
brother said.
	   ``We aren't asking for preferential treatment. We simply ask
that (his) human rights be respected,'' Vladimir Ramirez Sanchez
told reporters.
	   His brother has refused food and water since Nov. 3 because of
alleged mistreatment at La Sante prison, where he is serving a life
sentence for the 1975 murders of two French investigators and a
Lebanese national.
	   Venezuela's ambassador to France, Francisco Kerdel Vegas, who is
a doctor, visited Ramirez in prison and confirmed that his health
is deteriorating dangerously, Venezuela's Foreign Ministry said.
	   ``If my brother dies, the only one responsible will be the
government of France,'' said Vladimir Ramirez, adding that Carlos
is ``prepared to die.''
	   The Venezuelan government has asked France to ensure that
Ramirez's rights are respected _ a request the French are
reviewing, according to Venezuela's Foreign Ministry. France has
not commented publicly.
	   Ramirez was linked to the spectacular 1975 seizure of OPEC
ministers in Vienna, Austria, and the 1976 hijacking of an Air
France jet to Uganda. French agents snared him in Khartoum, Sudan,
on Aug. 15, 1994, and then hauled him to Paris in a sack.

Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow

would retaliate if attacked grafs 13-14 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Hundreds of jittery British tourists
broke off their holiday at a southern resort Thursday and Israel
opened gas mask distribution centers for its citizens as the
U.S.-Iraq showdown over weapons inspections intensified.
	   However Israeli officials said they believed the possibility of
an Iraqi retaliatory attack on Israel, as was the case during the
1991 Gulf War, was slim and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
he wasn't even sure if he had a gas mask at home.
	   Netanyahu stressed that Israel does not want to be part of what
he termed as ``a real crisis,'' over United Nations weapons
inspections but wasn't taking any chances.
	   ``We have to take the necessary precautions,'' he told
reporters.
	   For Israelis, it was the third time in one year that they have
been asked to prepare for the possibility of an attack. But unlike
during tense flare-ups last November and in February, the general
public seemed to be taking a wait-and-see approach Thursday.
	   ``I think people are very much weathered by the whole thing.
It's been like a cry-wolf scenario for a year and we can't know
what will happen,'' said Amber Landeau, a 25 year-old from Tel
Aviv.
	   In February, panic-stricken Israelis rushed to exchange gas
masks for newer models with fresh filters. Fighting broke out at
several centers over protective gear for infants. There was a
shortage of plastic sheeting used for sealing rooms against
chemical or biological weapons and Israeli pharmaceutical companies
began manufacturing antidotes.
	   Thursday, only a trickle of people showed up at the 65 gas mask
centers opened around the country.
	   ``My daughter persuaded me to go,'' said Ariel Schindler, 83, as
he prepared to go inside.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States to
exercise restraint Thursday and avoid striking at Iraq, a move he
said would be detrimental to the Mideast peace process. he said he
had sent an envoy to Baghdad to help mediate the situation.
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that an attack on a
fellow Arab nation by the current sponsor of the Mideast peace
process could ignite popular street support and place Arafat in a
difficult position.
	   A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity
did not rule out Thursday the possibility that Saddam would strike
at the Jewish state again if attacked by the U.S. Unlike in 1991
however, the official said this time Israel would respond to an
Iraqi attack.
	   ``If they dare to attack us, they will get a reponse,'' the
official said.

and Albanian rebels swore revenge for five dead comrades, battering
the spirit of Kosovo's month-old peace accord.
	   The armed hostage-takers were seeking the release of two people
who went missing a day earlier in the central Drenica region, a
trouble spot throughout much of this year's eight-month crackdown
by Serb forces on separatist guerrillas.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, which is close to the Kosovo
Albanian leadership, said as many as 100 ethnic Albanians were
taken hostage early Thursday _ a figure that could not be
independently confirmed.
	   The ethnic Albanians were reportedly taken off a bus near the
border with Montenegro and transported to Crnac, a village 50
kilometers (30 miles) northwest of Pristina. The center said some
were threatened with ``liquidation'' unless the two Serbs were
released.
	   Late Thursday, the Serb Media Center, close to the Serbian
government, reported that all of the hostages had been released. No
further information was available and the status of the two
detained Serbs was uncertain.
	   William Walker, the American diplomat heading an effort to carry
out the peace deal in Kosovo, promised earlier to ``take
appropriate steps'' after finding out the exact circumstances of
the detentions.
	   The detentions and a funeral for slain fighters of the Kosovo
Liberation Army guerillas reflected the high level of Serb-Albanian
tensions even after an Oct. 12 agreement to end the crisis in the
province of Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   The Serb crackdown on ethnic Albanian separatists has left
hundreds dead, mostly Albanian civilians, and made refugees of
hundreds of thousands more.
	   The U.S. envoy for Kosovo, Christopher Hill, said Thursday that
results from the October agreement were taking shape, ``but we have
a long way to go.'' Hill, in Pristina to meet Walker, said he would
be going to Belgrade on Friday to talk with Serb authorities on
implementation of a plan that would give Kosovo Albanians wide
autonomy.
	   In the western village of Retimlje, about 100 uniformed KLA
guerrillas attended a memorial for two of five fighters killed last
week. Many cried openly during an emotional speech by Sebajdin
Cena, a KLA commander.
	   Gjelal Hajda, 31, and Selajdin Mullaabazi, 28, died when their
cars encountered a Serb police patrol. Police said the guerrillas
fired first.
	   ``Their deaths unite us even more, and their blood gives us more
strength,'' Cena said.
	   The dead guerrillas ``will constantly ask us ... `Have you
fulfilled our last wish, did you take revenge for us?' '' he said.
``We tell them ... that we continue to fight, we continue to spill
blood because we are the sons of Albanians.''

Researchers find latent HIV traces in men despite appearing
</HEADLINE>
virus-free &QL; 
 &UR; By JOSEPH B. VERRENGIA &QC; 
 &UR; AP Science Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   DENVER (AP) _ Researchers say they have found genetic material
from the AIDS virus still lurking in the semen cells of men whose
use of the AIDS drug cocktail had reduced the virus in their blood
to undetectable levels.
	   In a study to be released Friday, virologists at Thomas
Jefferson University in Philadelphia said that patients with the
HIV provirus _ the genetic component of the AIDS virus _ might
still be able to transmit the virus to others if they fail to
practice safe sex.
	   In test-tube experiments, the scientists were able to grow the
AIDS virus when they combined tiny provirus samples from the men
with blood from individuals who had never been infected.
	   The researchers described these provirus reservoirs as the
``Trojan horse'' of AIDS, and said they may lurk in the brain and
retina cells, too. Determining how to eradicate these last traces
is the ``endgame'' in the two-decade battle against AIDS, they
said.
	   The study will be presented Friday at the annual
infectious-diseases meeting being held in Denver.
	   ``In many patients, we've gone 90 yards and we're at the point
where we just have to push the ball over the goal line,'' said Dr.
Roger J. Pomerantz, director of the Center of Human Virology at
Thomas Jefferson. ``But those last 10 yards can be very hard.''
	   In a separate study, Brown University researchers will report
that combination drug therapy effectively lowers viral levels in
the genital tracts of HIV-infected women. This may reduce the risk
of transmitting the virus to adults during sex and to babies during
childbirth, said obstetrics researcher Dr. Susan Cu-Uvin.
	   However, Cu-Uvin said, up to 3 percent of the women in the Brown
study did not have detectable levels of HIV in their blood but
still had HIV traces in their genital fluids, indicating the
presence of provirus.
	   Other AIDS researchers agreed that these reservoirs of dormant
HIV probably represent the final barrier to curing AIDS.
	   The first step, researchers said, is determining precisely where
the genetic traces of HIV are hiding.
	   A likely location, they said, is the CD4 T cells. The cells
function as the immune system's memory and are found throughout the
body. Up to 1 million of these cells appear to hang onto the
blueprint of HIV for as long as 10 years so the body will recognize
the infection and mount a defense if it appears again.
	   In the Philadelphia study, Pomerantz sampled cells in the semen
of seven men who had no detectable HIV freely circulating in their
blood or semen.
	   Pomerantz found provirus reservoirs locked in cells of four of
the men. The three other men could have provirus reservoirs in
cells located in other difficult-to-study crannies of the body,
such as the brain or the retina of the eye, he said.
	   ``These are the patients who are doing the best,'' Pomerantz
said. ``If it happens in them, it is likely to be more common in
the general HIV-infected community.''
	   He recommended that these men continue taking AIDS drugs and
practice safe sex.
	   AIDS researchers are debating how to best treat _ and perhaps
cure _ these carriers.
	   Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland has attempted to purge
the infected memory cells by triggering them to spring to life with
hormones.
	   In theory, the activated memory cells would release their virus
and die. Antiviral drugs would catch the released virus.
	   Another strategy is to give patients higher doses of existing
AIDS drugs or use more powerful ones still in testing stages.

Norsk Hydro signs on aluminum plant project to supply NAmerican
</HEADLINE>
market &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ With plans to build a dlrs 1.6
billion aluminum smelter to supply the North American market,
Trinidad and Norway's Norsk Hydro signed a project agreement
Thursday.
	   It would be the largest single investment ever made in the
English-speaking Caribbean, eclipsing Trinidad's dlrs 1 billion
liquefied natural gas project.
	   Plans for the 237,000-ton smelter are subject to technical
studies and a final investment decision expected toward the end of
1999, said officials at the signing ceremony.
	   ``The project is market driven and gives us a competitive source
with a good location to serve our growing activities in North
America and even Europe,'' said Tormod Bjork, who heads the
company's business sand project development unit. ``We are looking
at a large volume, low-cost aluminum plant in Trinidad.''
	   The island's energy minister, Finbar Gangar, said that the
project required ``considerable government support'' and had been
given a 10-year tax holiday and other fiscal incentives as well as
a competitive natural gas price.
	   Eivind Reiten, president of Hydro Aluminum, said that Norsk
Hydro had chosen Trinidad over Venezuela and Qatar because of the
incentives and the island's proximity to rapidly developing
aluminum markets in North America. Before signing the project
agreement, Hydro announced that it had postponed the study of a
metal plant project in Qatar in the Arabian Gulf.
	   The Trinidadian project is expected to provide 2,500 jobs during
construction and create permanent employment for 550 people.
	   Norsk Hydro came to Trinidad in 1991 and operates a three-plant
ammonia complex that produces 1.2 million tons.

Yoshii gets dlrs 5 million, two-year contract from Mets
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RONALD BLUM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Mets re-signed another of their
starting pitchers, agreeing Thursday to a dlrs 5 million, two-year
contract with Masato Yoshii.
	   The 33-year-old right-hander joined the Mets last January
following a successful career in Japan. He went 6-8 with a 3.93 ERA
in 29 starts.
	   ``Masato deserves a lot of credit,'' Mets manager Bobby
Valentine said. ``He easily could have stayed in Japan last season
and made more money, but he was determined to prove himself in the
United States. He did just that and more.''
	   Yoshii had a dlrs 200,000 base salary with the Mets this year
but earned dlrs 875,000 more in performance bonuses to raise his
earnings to dlrs 1,075,000. His new deal calls for salaries of dlrs
2 million next year and dlrs 3 million in 2000.
	   ``I really enjoyed myself with the Mets last year,'' Yoshii said
in a statement. ``Bobby understands me and the type of pitcher I
am. I think I proved I can pitch in the major leagues last season,
and it is my goal this year to improve and help the Mets get to the
playoffs.''
	   Valentine first saw Yoshii in Japan, when Valentine managed the
Chiba Lotte Marines. Yoshii played for the Kintetsu Buffaloes of
the Pacific League from 1985-94, then moved to the Yakult Swallows
of the Central League.
	   In the middle of last season, the Mets obtained Hideo Nomo,
another Japanese pitcher, after he pitched inconsistently for the
Dodgers.
	   Yoshii's contract allowed him to become a free agent unless he
and the Mets agreed to a new deal by this Sunday.
	   Al Leiter, who also was eligible for free agency, remained with
the Mets for a dlrs 32 million, four-year contract.

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Dozens of ethnic Albanian hostages
in Kosovo were released late Thursday after being held by Serb
civilians since early in the day, Serb sources said.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to the Kosovo Albanian

said up to 100 were taken hostage. The figures could not be

	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The Spice Girls showed they are not ready to
be taken off the shelf just yet, claiming two trophies including
for the coveted Best Group category at the fifth MTV Europe Music
Awards.
	   While rival British all-girl band All Saints had topped the
nominations with four, the Spice Girls _ who saw Ginger Spice
(Gerri Halliwell) leave the group earlier this year _ joined
Madonna as the only double winners Thursday night at Milan's
FilaForum.
	   ``We've done it again,'' yelled Sporty Spice (Mel C) as she and
Baby Spice (Emma Bunton) accepted the group honor for a second
straight year. They later added the Best Pop award.
	   Madonna, who performed her new single ``Power of Goodbye,'' won
for Best Female Artist, as well as Best Album for ``Ray of Light.''
	   All Saints, who performed without pregnant member Melanie Blatt,
had to be content with a single honor, for Breakthrough Act.
	   Other winners included Beastie Boys (Best Rap Act), Natalie
Imbruglia (Best Song for ``Torn''), Aerosmith (Best Rock Act) and
former Take That member Robbie Williams (Best Male Act), who closed
the show with a rousing medley performance.

PSV good enough to win against ten men
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Troubled PSV Eindhoven grabbed a
much-needed victory Thursday over Vitesse, downing the Arnhem side
3-1 with a little help from the referee.
	   But Bobby Robson's PSV, which must visit Ajax Sunday, still
languishes in ninth place with 18 points, while Vitesse is fifth
with 23.
	   Vitesse was reduced to ten men after just nine minutes when
reserve keeper Sander Westerveld unluckily handled a ball outside
the penalty box and was shown red by referee Herman van Dijk.
	   Belgian striker Luc Nilis was the architect of Vitesse's
destruction with two goals in the first half, but the visitors
rallied after the break.
	   Arco Jochemse pulled a goal back after 72 minutes but Ruud van
Nistelrooy decided the game for PSV with ten minutes to go.
	   The final three minutes was ten-against-ten after PSV's
Lithuanian defender Andrius Skerla received a second yellow card.

Israel opens gas mask distribution centers as Gulf tensions grow
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with further comment from Israeli official that Israel
would retaliate if attacked grafs 13-14 &QL;

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Hundreds of jittery British tourists
broke off their holiday at a southern resort Thursday and Israel
opened gas mask distribution centers for its citizens as the
U.S.-Iraq showdown over weapons inspections intensified.
	   However Israeli officials said they believed the possibility of
an Iraqi retaliatory attack on Israel, as was the case during the
1991 Gulf War, was slim and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said
he wasn't even sure if he had a gas mask at home.
	   Netanyahu stressed that Israel does not want to be part of what
he termed as ``a real crisis,'' over U.N. weapons inspections but
wasn't taking any chances.
	   ``We have to take the necessary precautions,'' he told
reporters.
	   For Israelis, it was the third time in one year that they have
been asked to prepare for the possibility of an attack. But unlike
during tense flare-ups last November and in February, the general
public seemed to be taking a wait-and-see approach Thursday.
	   ``I think people are very much weathered by the whole thing.
It's been like a cry-wolf scenario for a year and we can't know
what will happen,'' said Amber Landeau, a 25-year-old from Tel
Aviv.
	   In February, panic-stricken Israelis rushed to exchange gas
masks for newer models with fresh filters. Fighting broke out at
several centers over protective gear for infants. There was a
shortage of plastic sheeting used for sealing rooms against
chemical or biological weapons and Israeli pharmaceutical companies
began manufacturing antidotes.
	   Thursday, only a trickle of people showed up at the 65 gas mask
centers opened around the country.
	   ``My daughter persuaded me to go,'' said Ariel Schindler, 83, as
he prepared to go inside.
	   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat urged the United States to
exercise restraint Thursday and avoid striking at Iraq, a move he
said would be detrimental to the Mideast peace process. Arafat said
he had sent an envoy to Baghdad to help mediate the situation.
	   Arafat supported Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in the 1991 Gulf
War in which Iraq fired 39 Scud missiles at Israel. However, the
Palestinians have remained neutral in subsequent crises.
	   Palestinian negotiator Hassan Asfour said that an attack on a
fellow Arab nation by the current sponsor of the Mideast peace
process could ignite popular street support and place Arafat in a
difficult position.
	   A senior Israeli official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
did not rule out Thursday the possibility that Saddam would strike
at the Jewish state again if Iraq was attacked by the United
States. Unlike in 1991 however, the official said this time Israel
would respond to an Iraqi attack.
	   ``If they dare to attack us, they will get a reponse,'' the
official said.

	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Second seeded Felix Mantilla of Spain
breezed past Eduardo Medica of Argentina 6-0, 6-1 Thursday to make
the quarterfinals of the dlrs 320,000 Chevrolet Cup tennis
tournament.
	   Also advancing to quarters were Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica
who upset eighth seeded Franco Squilari of Argentina 6-4, 4-6, 6-4
and Jim Courier of the United States, who defeated Dominik Hrbaty
of Slovakia 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
	   As play was to start a small group of supporters of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet gathered at the entrance of
the San Carlos with signs protesting the arrest of Pinochet in
London on a warrant by a Spanish judge. Police asked the
demonstrators to leave the area, which they did peacefully.

Serie B's Atalanta upsets Roma on penalties
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Goalkeeper Davide Pinato blocked Marco Delvecchio's
attempt from the spot and second-division Atalanta of Bergamo
shocked AS Roma 5-4 on penalty kicks Thursday night to advance to
the Italian Cup quarterfinals.
	   After 120 minutes of action, the clubs were tied 1-1, the same
score of the first leg match at Bergamo two weeks ago.
	   Luigi Di Biagio _ whose missed penalties knocked Italy out of
the World Cup quarterfinals last summer and cost Roma a Serie A
victory at Empoli earlier this season _ and Eusebio Di Francesco
made Roma's first two attempts in the shootout.
	   But then Pinato dove to his left to smother Delvecchio's effort.
	   Giacomo Banchelli, Walter Bonacina, Pierre Giorgio Regonesi,
Nicola Caccia and Damiano Zenoni made Atalanta a perfect 5-for-5 on
its penalties, while Francesco Totti and Alessandro Frau hit the
hosts' last two to no avail.
	   Atalanta, the only Serie B club left in the tournament, will
face current Serie A leader Fiorentina in the two-leg
quarterfinals, scheduled for Dec. 2 and Jan. 27. Fiorentina
eliminated Lecce on a 5-0 aggregate Tuesday.
	   The other quarterfinal pairings are defending titlist Lazio of
Rome against Internazionale of Milan, a rematch of last season's
UEFA Cup final; Juventus of Turin against Bologna; and AC Parma
against Udinese.
	   Roma coach Zdenek Zeman started a slew of reserves Thursday and
paid for that decision. It was not until the second half that he
inserted Totti and Delvecchio, the team's most effective forwards
this season.
	   And the pair combined to score Roma's lone goal, with an
unmarked Totti meeting Delvecchio's cross to slam it home from
close range in the 80th minute to level the score.
	   Atalanta had taken the lead just four minutes earlier, when
Caccia took a through-ball from Bonacina and chipped a lob over
Roma 'keeper Antonio Chimenti.
	   In matchups completed Wednesday, Lazio eliminated AC Milan 4-2,
Inter edged third-division Castel di Sangro 2-1, Juventus got past
Venezia 2-1 on away goals with a 3-3 aggregate, Bologna beat

Russia expects to begin receiving E.U. food aid in January

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia will seek a second restructuring of its
Soviet-era debt, a deputy finance minister said, a move likely to
further undermine the government's sullied reputation among foreign
creditors.
	   The announcement, though not surprising, was another blow to
Russia's crumbling economy.
	   Meanwhile, Russian officials bracing for a harsh winter were on
the verge of signing a food aid deal with the European Union that
would start providing wheat, rice, beef and pork in early January.
	   Deputy Finance Minister Mikhail Kasyanov said in an interview
published Thursday that Russia would be asking creditors for some
``breathing space on the payments of the debt in the next year or
two.''
	   The Soviet-debt payments are part of dlrs 17.5 billion in
foreign debt that Russia was to pay creditors next year.
	   First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov has said the
government was seeking to reschedule the payments, but he did not
specify whether it would restructure Russian or Soviet debt.
	   Foreign lenders expected the government to try to pay off the
newer, Russian debt first, and Kasyanov's announcement, in an
interview with the business daily Kommersant, confirmed the
speculations. Kasyanov did not rule out the possibility that the
government would want to reschedule the Russian debt as well.
	   Russia inherited about dlrs 100 billion in total Soviet debt in
1991, and dlrs 160 billion in non-performing loans the Soviet Union
had made to developing countries. Since the Soviet collapse, Russia
has built up another dlrs 50 billion in foreign debt, Kasyanov
said.

Prince Charles hosts birthday dinner
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Prince Charles played host Thursday night to
celebrities and supporters at a 50th birthday celebration that also
marked the opening of an exhibition of his paintings.
	   Camilla Parker Bowles, the prince's longtime love, was among the
guests at Hampton Court Palace, but she arrived with other friends
and was not seated at the head table. She will host a party for the
prince on his birthday, Saturday, at his country house.
	   Former Spice Gerri Halliwell, composer Andrew LLoyd-Webber and
an array of British actors and royal relatives turned up Thursday
evening for a formal dinner at the Great Hall of Hampton Court,
which once was the home of King Henry VIII, 6 miles (10 km) west of
London.
	   The palace, usually open to the public, is the site of the new
``Travels with the Prince'' exhibition.
	   The works he selected to mark his 50th birthday include 50
paintings he has done while traveling officially and on vacation.
He also chose 50 works by 10 British artists who have accompanied
him on foreign tours since 1985, providing a record of visits to
many countries.
	   The prince will spend Friday on official engagements in
Sheffield, northern England, then return to London for a birthday
reception at Buckingham Palace given by Queen Elizabeth II and
Prince Philip to recognize the accomplishments of the many
organizations with which he is connected.

<TEXT>
	   MILAN, Italy (AP) _ The Spice Girls showed they are not ready to
be taken off the shelf just yet, claiming two trophies including
the coveted Best Group honor at the fifth MTV Europe Music Awards.
	   While rival British ``girl band'' All Saints had topped the
nominations with four, the Spice Girls joined Madonna as the only
double winners Thursday night at Milan's FilaForum.
	   ``We've done it again,'' yelled Sporty Spice (Mel C) as she and
Baby Spice (Emma Bunton) accepted the group honor for a second
straight year. They later added the Best Pop award.
	   It has been a tumultous year for the group, which has been
denying it is on the verge of quitting since member Ginger Spice
(Gerri Halliwell) left earlier this year.
	   Two other members, Posh Spice (Victoria Adams) and Scary Spice
(Mel B) are pregnant, and were not in Milan.
	   Madonna, who performed her new single ``Power of Goodbye,'' won
for Best Female Artist, as well as Best Album for ``Ray of Light.''
	   ``I would like to thank my daughter for inspiring me,'' she
said.
	   All Saints, who performed without pregnant member Melanie Blatt,
had to be content with a single honor, for Breakthrough Act, given
to a performer that has emerged this year.
	   Former Take That pop outfit member Robbie Williams opened the
evening by taking the first award, for Best Male Act _ ``Your damn
right!'' was the whole of his acceptance speech _ and closed the
show with a rousing medley performance.
	   But the two-hour awards ceremony was short on inspiration when
it came to either singing or speaking. When The Prodigy went on
stage to accept its trophy for Best Dance Act, another repeat
victory, member Liam Howlett said, ``We haven't done (anything)
this year. We don't deserve this.''
	   Fashion and soccer, two of Italy's prime passions, took center
stage.
	   Award presenters included Italian League soccer stars Ronaldo
and Alessandro Del Piero, as well as designers Giorgio Armani, Jean
Paul Gaultier and Donatella Versace. Instead of the usual award
show envelopes, winners' names were enclosed in colorful handbags.
	   Other winners included Beastie Boys (Best Rap Act), Natalie
Imbruglia (Best Song for ``Torn''), Aerosmith (Best Rock Act), and
Massive Attack, whose Best Video Award for ``Teardrop'' was
presented by the Duchess of York.
	   The Free Your Mind award went to station Radio B92, based in
Belgrade, for its work for human rights in the former Yugoslavia.
Presenter Michael Stipe, the frontman of U.S. band REM, said the
prize money would be used to allow the station to broadcast from a
new transmission tower.
	   MTV viewers voted for most of the awards, after an 800-member
music industry panel selected the nominees.

Nigerian youths take oil workers hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Armed youths stormed an offshore oil
exploration rig used by Texaco Co. near southern Nigeria and took
seven foreigners and a Nigerian hostage, a Texaco official said
Thursday.
	   Three Americans are among the hostages, Houston-based Texaco
spokesman Paul Weeditz said.
	   A Briton, a South African, an Italian and a Croatian were also
taken along with the Nigerian oil worker, Weeditz said.
	   ``There were no injuries we know of and no damage to the rig,''
Weeditz said.
	   Another Texaco official in Nigeria, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the hostages were taken at gunpoint Wednesday from
the drilling rig and ferried ashore.
	   ``They were taken to an undisclosed location and are being held
until a ransom is paid,'' the official said.
	   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria's commercial capital of
Lagos were unavailable for comment.
	   The Texaco official in Nigeria said a boatload of youths from
the Ijaw ethnic group arrived at the oil rig and took the hostages
at gunpoint.
	   The youths are demanding a cash ransom in addition to improved
infrastructure facilities for their communities in the
poverty-ridden Niger River delta region.
	   Oil companies, including Shell and Chevron, are frequently the
targets of protests and occasionally hostage-takings as local
communities vent their anger over what they see as government and
the oil company neglect for their plight.
	   Although Nigeria is one of the world's largest oil producers,
the people who live in the oil-rich Niger delta often exist in
subsistence poverty in communities without electricity or running
water.
	   Shell in recent weeks was forced to temporarily shut down
several oil pumping relay stations after armed youths stormed the
facilities and demanded compensation from the government.
	   Texaco says the workers taken on Wednesday were contract
employees working for other oil service companies hired to conduct
exploratory drilling in the region.
	   Texaco's Weeditz said the companies Nigerian subsidiary, Texaco
Overseas Petroleum Co., was coordinating with local authorities and
the police.
	   ``We're working through the federal, state and local governments
in Nigeria to address the situation just as we would any where
else, Weeditz said. ``We treat any instance involving our
operations with great care.''

U.S. to demonstrate displeasure with Malaysian ruler
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TERENCE HUNT &QC; 
 &UR; AP White House Correspondent &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ In a diplomatic slap at Malaysia's
authoritarian leader, Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will
seek a meeting with the wife of ousted Deputy Premier Anwar Ibrahim
in Kuala Lumpur next week, a White House official said Thursday.
	   In addition, President Clinton and other U.S. officials
attending an international forum in Kuala Lumpur will shun all
private contact with Malaysian officials outside of the meeting
itself, said Ken Lieberthal, senior director for Asia on the
National Security Council staff.
	   Lieberthal said Clinton ``may choose to comment'' in Kuala
Lumpur on the political situation in Malaysia and the imprisonment
of Anwar, Malaysia's most prominent dissident. Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar as his deputy Sept. 2, saying his
former protege was morally unfit to lead.
	   Malaysia was chosen four years ago as the site for this year's
forum and no one anticipated then ``that this kind of situation
would arise,'' Lieberthal said. The United States has been a major
player at the annual gathering of world leaders, and ``you do not
walk away from that kind of vehicle ... because of some other set
of political concerns,'' he said.
	   Clinton is to arrive in Malaysia early Monday for the sixth
annual Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit bringing together
leaders of 21 Pacific Rim countries. However, the possibility of
airstrikes against Iraq could change his travel plans.
	   The president plans to use the Malayasia visit for separate
talks with President Jiang Zemin of China, Prime Minister Yevgeny
Primakov of Russia, standing in for the ailing President Boris
Yeltsin, and Prime Minster Chuan Leekpai of Thailand. Clinton also
is to hold an informal meeting with President B.J. Habibie of
Indonesia.
	   Lieberthal said it was ``quite possible'' that Albright would
find an opportunity to meet with Anwar's wife, Azizah Ismail.
	   ``That is not confirmed, but that is certainly something that
she would like to see occur if it can be arranged in an appropriate
fashion,'' he said.
	   Albright, Vice President Al Gore and Treasury Secretary Robert
Rubin all have expressed concern about ``the apparent moving away
from democratic principles and toward more authoritarian ways
there,'' Lieberthal said.
	   Saying that U.S. contacts would be limited, Lieberthal said,
``Our rubbing shoulders with Malaysian officials would be totally
in the context of the APEC meeting itself.''
	   Before returning to Washington on Nov. 23, Clinton also is to
make stops in Japan, South Korea and Guam.

Bulgarian men win two weight categories
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAHTI, Finland (AP) _ Bulgaria's Plamen Jeliazkov set a snatch
world record of 352 pounds (158 kilograms) in the 152-pound
(68-kilogram) weight class Thursday at the weightlifting World
Championships. He won the title with a total of 770 pounds (347
kilograms).
	   Greece's Georgios Tzelilis, who totaled 748 pounds (336
kilograms), took the silver and Wan Jianhui of China won the
bronze. In the 169-pound (76-kilogram) class, Zlatan Vanev and
Petar Tanev repeated Bulgaria's 1-2 finish from last year. Vanev
lifted 803 pounds (360 kilograms) and Tanev 798 pounds (359
kilograms).
	   Last year, Bulgarians Joto Jotov and Georgi Gandev won gold and
silver in the weight class, then 167 pounds (75 kilograms). New
weight categories were set at the beginning of this year as two
classes were dropped among both women and men.
	   Turkey's Mehmet Yilmaz and Viktor Mitru of Greece tied for the
169-pound (76-kilogram) bronze with 792 pounds (356 kilograms) but
Yilmaz got the medal as the lighter competitor. Mitru lost the
bronze medal at the 1996 Olympics the same way.

Japan's ruling party unveils new economic stimulus package
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with reports package could exceed 20 trillion yen in
new 6th graf; Picks up 6th graf prev, ``The head ...'' &QL; 
 &UR; By JOJI SAKURAI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party presented its latest recession
rescue blueprint Thursday, but the stimulus package _ Japan's
largest ever _ failed to lift gloom among business leaders and
economists.
	   As Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi prepares to meet U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Asian leaders at an economic forum in Malaysia
this weekend, Japan has been pressured to show initiative in
halting its economic slide and leading the region out of crisis.
	   Instead of hope, however, Thursday's 18 trillion yen (dlrs 147
billion) tax cut and spending proposal was greeted by a sharp fall
in Tokyo's main stock index, skepticism among economic analysts,
and widespread indifference on local news broadcasts.
	   ``There is a feeling of slight disappointment,'' said Masaaki
Higashida, deputy general manager of investment information and
services at Nomura Securities. ``The package didn't go beyond what
was already known.''
	   The ruling Liberal Democratic Party's proposal calls for 10
trillion yen (dlrs 81 billion) in public works-related spending
through next March and 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) in income
tax cuts next year. Another 4 trillion yen (dlrs 33 billion) was
expected in corporate tax cuts and other tax relief measures.
	   Japanese newspapers, however, reported Friday that the final
package could end up totaling in excess of 20 trillion yen (dlrs
182 billion).
	   The head of Japan's Economic Planning Agency, Taichi Sakaiya,
said Thursday that the government plan will likely include a mix of
tax cuts worth about 7 trillion yen (dlrs 57 billion).
	   The widely expected package was compiled in a bid to prevent
Japan's economy from shrinking for a third consecutive year and to
fulfill Obuchi's pledge to engineer a recovery within two years.
	   The plan will form the basis of an official government plan to
be formally announced Monday and expected to be passed later this
month in a special session of Parliament.
	   Kyodo News agency quoted several private industry leaders as
grumbling about the package, saying it would simply slow the pace
of Japan's economic downturn rather than usher in growth.
	   The government has been prodded both at home and abroad to do
more to deal with record unemployment, soaring bankruptcies and
deeply shaken consumer confidence.
	   On Tuesday, President Clinton singled out Japan as the key to
reviving economic growth in Asia and pulling the region out of the
financial crisis that is beginning to be felt on American soil.
	   ``The restoration of growth in Japan, which has been stalled now
for more than five years, is absolutely essential to the
restoration of growth in the rest of Asia,'' Clinton said. ``The
rest of us look to Japan to move quickly.''
	   Irritation with Japan was already brewing Thursday among
officials at the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in
Malaysia, where Obuchi will travel this weekend.
	   Asian delegates slammed Japan's opposition to a proposed
free-trade agreement, saying it could sow discord just as the
leaders were trying to achieve consensus on strategies to restore
prosperity to the troubled region.
	   Investors in Japan expressed dissatisfaction with the
government's stimulus plan. The benchmark Nikkei 225 stock index
fell 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent, to 14,075.06.
	   Japan officially estimates gross domestic product will contract
by 1.8 percent in the fiscal year ending March 31, 1999. The
economy shrank 0.7 percent last year.
	   The proposals announced Thursday for a supplementary budget, the
third such appropriation measure so far this year, also include
reducing the effective Japanese corporate tax rate to 40 percent in
the fiscal year starting next April, from the current rate of about
46 percent.
	   The ruling party also called for consideration of tax incentives
to stimulate housing demand and private investment.
	   One idea aimed at getting consumers to spend more, instead of
saving more, is the distribution of government-issued shopping
coupons worth about 20,000 yen (dlrs 163) to the elderly and
families with young children.

	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Monica Seles and Natalie Tauziat,
seeded fifth and sixth, advanced to the quarterfinals with
victories Thursday in the Advanta Championships.
	   One seed fell, as No. 7 Patty Schnyder of Switzerland lost to
qualifier Amy Frazier 6-3, 6-1.
	   After easily winning the first set, Seles defeated Japan's Ai
Sugiyama 6-3, 7-5. She fell behind 4-1 in the second set but
rallied to 6-5. She used a cross-court return to win the first
point of the final game, then swung her powerful backhands to
secure three consecutive points.
	   Seles moves on to face Belgium's Natasha Zvereva.
	   Tauziat improved her lifetime record against Lisa Raymond to 5-0
in a 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) victory.
	   Steffi Graf, who entered the tournament unseeded and won her
first-round match against Mary Joe Fernandez, had needed a victory
over Russia's Elena Lihovtseva in the evening session to advance to
the Chase Championships in New York next week.
	   But Seles' defeat of Sugiyama ensured Graf a spot in the
16-player Chase singles field. Sugiyama could have qualified by
reaching the final in Philadelphia.
	   In doubles, Raymond, who is from nearby Wayne, Pennsylvania and
Australian Rennae Stubbs defeated Lori McNeil and Kimberley Po 6-2,
6-1 to move on to the semifinals. The dlrs 450,000 Advanta
tournament is the final event on the WTA Tour before the Chase
Championships.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Top-seeded Marcelo Rios of Chile gained
the quarterfinals of the Chevrolet Cup tennis tournament and
strengthened his bid for the No. 1 world ranking with a 6-2, 6-2
victory over Martin Rodriguez of Argentina on Thursday.
	   Peter Sampras' first round loss to Jason Stoltenberg of
Australia in the Stockholm Open could pave the way for Rios' return
to the No. 1 ranking if he wins his hometown tournament.
	   Still, Rios said, he does feel not pressured for the possibility
of moving past Sampras.
	   ``I was to play pressured, I would not play well,'' he said.
``Besides, all the matches I have ahead here will be difficult.''
	   Felix Mantilla of Spain breezed past Eduardo Medica of Argentina
6-0, 6-1 to also make it to the quarterfinals of the dlrs 320,000
event.
	   In other matches, Juan Antonio Marin of Costa Rica beat
eighth-seeded Franco Squilari of Argentina 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 and Jim
Courier defeated Dominik Hrbaty of Slovakia 7-6 (7-5), 6-4.
	   As play was to start, a small group of supporters of former
Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet gathered at the entrance of
the arena with signs protesting Pinochet's arrest in London. Police
asked the demonstrators to leave the area, which they did
peacefully.

<TEXT>
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ A U.S. expedition to search for 18th
century treasure on Robinson Crusoe island has been approved by
Chilean authorities, the National Monuments Commission said
Thursday.
	   Authorization was given for ``scientific and archaeological
diggings aimed at finding the exact place where a valuable shipment
was buried in the 18th century,'' the commission said.
	   The site is about six miles (ten kilometers) from the island's
only populated village.
	   Chilean scientists were assigned to follow the expedition
because the three-island area, 500 miles (800 kilometers) west of
mainland Chile, is a national park, the commission said. If
treasure is found, Chile would keep 75 percent and the remaining 25
percent would go to the expedition.

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Supporters of former Chilean dictator
Augusto Pinochet on Monday issued a death threat through the
Internet against the Spanish judge who ordered the former despot's
arrest recently in London.
	   Magistrate Baltasar Garzon had the 82-year-old Gen. Pinochet
arrested Oct. 16 in London where the former dictator was recovering
from back surgery.
	   ``We are prepared to do anything ... even a kidnapping, a bomb
attack or assassination of Baltasar Garzon, his wife Rosario and/or
his relatives,'' said the statement which was signed by a hitherto
unknown group calling itself the ``Organized Extreme Right.''
	   ``We don't rule out an attack resulting in death which would be
carried out if Judge Garzon obtains (Pinochet's) extradition,''
said the statement run at on the World Wide Web at
www.angelfire.com/de/lokofox.
	   The Spanish government on Tuesday transferred to Britain the
judge's request to extradite Pinochet to face charges of genocide,
terrorism and torture relating to the killing and disappearance of
thousands of people during his 1973-90 dictatorship.
	   The case is pending a decision by British judges on whether to
uphold or reject an English High Court ruling that Pinochet's
arrest was illegal and that as a former head of state he was
entitled to diplomatic immunity.
	   In the Internet page, which features a waving Chilean flag,
Pinochet supporters said they would be forced to act if the
government of President Eduardo Frei fails to defend the former
dictator, whom they call the ``founder of modern Chile'' and the
``Undefeated Ex-General of the Chilean Army.''
	   The statement warns that it will continue to ``pressure, to
harass and attack one way or another English and Spanish residents
in our country.''
	   Extreme right groups often make anonymous threats _ that they do
not carry out.
	   On Wednesday night, an anonymous caller to the airport in Buenos
Aires, Argentina, that a bomb had been planted on a plane Chilean
president Eduardo Frei was boarding for a flight to Johannesburg.
	   The flight was delayed for several hours as officials checked
the plane. No bomb was found and Frei flew safely for his two-day
state visit to South Africa.
	   A spokeswoman for the Chilean embassy in the Argentine capital
city, Olivia Mora, called the bomb threat ``the work of a mentally
ill person.''

	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul McCartney said he will be dedicating an
American rock and roll honor to his late wife.
	   The former Beatle is to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame as a solo artist. McCartney is already in the hall as a
member of the Beatles.
	   ''I am very excited and honored,'' McCartney said on Thursday.
''Rock and roll has played a huge part in my life and in that of my
lovely Linda _ so this one's for her.''
	   Linda McCartney died from breast cancer in April.
	   McCartney joins other new inductees Bruce Springsteen and Billy
Joel. The musicians will be formally inducted March 15 at the
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York.
	   The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum, where exhibits on the
hall of famers are kept, is in Cleveland. Musicians are eligible
for nomination to the hall 25 years after the release of their
first recording.

Spanish foreign minister announces plan for King to visit Cuba
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ In a sign of steadily improving relations,
Spanish Foreign Minister Abel Matutes said Thursday that King Juan
Carlos was due to visit Cuba in early 1999, though he said no date
has yet been set.
	   Matutes announced the planned visit at the end of a three-day
visit to the Cuban capital, Havana. There he met at least twice
with Cuban President Fidel Castro _ for a five-hour dinner and a
two-hour private session Wednesday night.
	   Matutes said the visit ``will be historic,'' noting that Cuba is
the only Latin American country never visited by Spanish monarchs.
	   He said details of the visit by Juan Carlos and Queen Sofia
would be worked out ``in the coming weeks.''
	   It would be, symbolically at least, the most important visit to
Cuba since Pope John Paul II visited in January.
	   The announcement was especially dramatic because relations
between Cuba and Spain hit a low point after conservative Prime
Minister Jose Maria Aznar took office in May 1996 and began to
sharply criticize Cuba's human rights situation.
	   In November 1996, Cuba rejected Spain's proposed ambassador,
setting off an exchange of insults between the two countries'
officials.
	   Matutes said relations between Spain and Cuba were entering ``a
new stage, which will experience a great impulse from the historic
visit of the king.''
	   He did not say if Spain had set any conditions for the royal
visit, but said the Cubans had agreed to ``full freedom of
movement'' for the king and ``the possibility to meet with all
sectors of Cuban society.''
	   Matutes met Thursday with several prominent Cuban dissidents and
gave Castro a list of prisoners that Spain would like to see freed.
	   He said human rights is a ``permanent worry'' of Spain. But his
public comments about the issue were muted.
	   ``It would not favor the cause now to have us airing the names
or concrete topics,'' he said when asked about names on the list.
	   Despite sometimes-difficult political relations between the two
countries, Spain has remained an important source of investment and
tourism for Cuba's struggling economy.

Egyptian man's hand cut off for stealing
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities chopped off the
right hand of an Egyptian man Thursday for stealing at Islam's
holiest site in Mecca, the official Saudi Press Agency reported.
	   Saudi Arabia's strict interpretation of Islamic law calls for
cutting off the right hand of thieves. Murderers, rapists, drug
traffickers and armed robbers are beheaded.
	   The press agency said Sharif Ali Ibrahim was convicted of
pickpocketing from worshippers praying in the Grand Mosque next to
the Kabaa, the focal point of Muslim prayers.
	   Amputations and executions are carried out with a sword in a
public square. This was the fifth amputation over the past few
months for pickpocketing in the mosque.

Media workers plan protest on Friday in Trinidad
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Trinidad's newspaper, radio and
television reporters plan a march to protest physical attacks
Sunday by a crowd they claim was incited to abuse them by Prime
Minister Basdeo Panday.
	   Members of the Trinidad and Tobago Media Association said
Thursday they decided on the ``March for Democracy'' on Friday over
proposals that included a boycott of reporting on government
matters, an open letter to Panday, a joint lawsuit and picketing of
Parliament.
	   During a political rally in the eastern town of Chaguanas
Sunday, Panday declared ``war'' on journalists and called them
enemies of his United National Congress Party. He called for an
advertising boycott of news organizations who ``attack our party
unfairly.''
	   Panday's supporters then doused journalists with beer and rum,
slugged a camera operator and shouted racial slurs at one reporter.
	   Panday's three years in office have been marked by clashes with
the news media. He has repeatedly accused reporters of racism
toward his party, which is dominated by Guyanese of East Indian
descent.
	   Trinidad and Tobago is racially divided between people of
African and Indian descent.
	   The attacks infuriated journalists' organizations in the
Caribbean. On Thursday, some reporters said they might still pursue
lawsuits.
	   ``The force of the law ought to be brought to bear upon Mister
Panday,'' said newspaper columnist B.C. Pires.

Trinidad and Tobago notifies three killers they will be hanged
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By TONY FRASER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PORT-OF-SPAIN, Trinidad (AP) _ Officials in Trinidad and Tobago
read execution orders Thursday to three convicted killers,
indicating they could be hanged as early as Tuesday.
	   The executions come amid a battle over the death penalty between
Britain and its former colonies in the Caribbean, who are forming
their own supreme court to bypass British restrictions on hangings.
	   On Thursday prison officials read death warrants to Dole Chadee,
Joey Ramiah and Ramkhelawan Singh, who were all convicted in
September 1996 for the midnight murder of a family of four in
southern Williamsville.
	   Prosecutors claimed the killings were drug-related. Chadee was
not present during the shootings, but a jury decided he had ordered
the killings.
	   The death warrants set no dates for the executions, but hangings
are traditionally performed the following Tuesday.
	   The three convicts appealed their sentences unsuccessfully to
the British Privy Council, the U.N. Human Rights Commission and the
Interamerican Human Rights Commission.
	   Chadee had filed a second appeal claiming the government singled
him out for execution. That appeal was to be heard in Trinidad's
High Court on Nov. 26.
	   The convicts' lawyers were expected to seek stays of execution
on Friday.
	   Britain has pressured Caribbean countries to stop using the
death penalty; and the British Privy Council, which serves as the
supreme court for most former British colonies in the region, ruled
in 1993 that no prisoner could be kept on death row for more than
five years. The ruling effectively commuted the death sentences of
dozens of convicts.
	   In response, Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad plan to cut
ties to the Privy Council and form their own Caribbean Court of
Justice.
	   Other Caribbean countries have recently resumed hangings after
years without an execution. The Bahamas hanged two men Oct. 15 and
St. Kitts and Nevis hanged one man on July 20.
	   The last execution in Trinidad was murderer Glen Ashby's in
1994.

	   Here is a summary of news from The Associated Press. Stories
carried ``i'' or ``f'' category codes. Some of the items below have
moved on this circuit in expanded form:
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Facing a U.S. military buildup and harsh
criticism from fellow Arabs, Iraq on Thursday blamed Washington for
the deepening crisis over U.N. arms inspections and said an
American attack would be ``a sheer aggression of criminals.''
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz _ his voice rising in anger _
charged that U.S. President Bill Clinton was blocking the
completion of arms inspections necessary for the lifting of
punishing trade sanctions on Iraq. ``The road is being blocked
continuously, stubbornly, illegally by his government,'' Aziz said
shortly after eight Arab states announced that Iraq itself would be
at fault if the U.S. military struck the country. (IRAQ-UN)
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Israel angered Palestinians on Thursday by
giving the go-ahead for construction of a Jewish housing project in
a disputed area of Jerusalem, but also pledged to begin turning
over West Bank territory next week. Dennis Ross, the United States
special Middle East envoy, is to arrive Friday in Israel to oversee
implementation of the nascent Mideast land-for-security accord, and
Palestinian officials were already asking him to help solve the
latest disputes. ``It is now crucial to have the American side join
us ... to oversee implementation of the agreement,'' said chief
Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat. He said the Palestinians would
not accept any ``post-agreement negotiations'' or new conditions to
the accord, signed at the White House Oct. 26.
(ISRAEL-PALESTINIANS)
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ The U.S. signing of the Kyoto
global warming treaty energized Thursday's talks in Argentina on
how to implement the accord's provisions for cutting pollutants
such as carbon dioxide. But critics said U.S. intentions, conveyed
here by U.S. Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, fall short
of those required to cut emissions of the world's largest polluter.
The United States was the last of the major industrial nations to
sign the accord agreed to last December in Kyoto, Japan, reducing
heat-trapping or ``greenhouse'' emissions by industrialized nations
by 2012. The U.S. signing is largely symbolic, because it still
needs to be ratified in Congress, where there is firm opposition.
Developing nations, which are not legally bound to emissions
targets under the treaty, maintain the United States is not taking
climate change seriously enough. (GLOBAL WARMING)
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Riot officers fired plastic bullets,
tear gas and water cannons Thursday at thousands of Indonesian
students during the biggest day of protests so far against the slow
pace of a government assembly on political reform. Students fought
back, hurling bottles and chunks of concrete at police in helmets
who chased and beat them with canes. The violence showed the
divisions that Indonesia faces as it edges toward democracy after
32 years of authoritarian rule, with students pressing for sweeping
change and the government urging a slower pace. At least 110
students were badly injured, medical staff and human rights groups
said. Several hospitals said about a dozen were in a critical
condition with plastic bullet wounds. One police officer was
reported injured. (INDONESIA-POLITICS)
	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ It was a monster dinosaur built for catching
fish, with razor teeth, a long snout and foot-long curved claws
that could hook and hold the big ones. Researchers who found the
fossil of this 36-foot-long (10 meters) animal believe it is a
previously unknown species big enough and mean enough to have
dominated its world 100 million years ago. The new species, to be
called Suchomimus tenerensis, ``was an impressive-sized beast,''
said Paul Sereno, a University of Chicago paleontologist who found
the fossils last year in the central African nation of Niger. ``If
you were standing next to it, your eye level would be at its
knee,'' Sereno said at a news conference at National Geographic
headquarters Thursday. ``This animal was easily the size of
Tyrannosaurus rex. And it was not fully grown.'' (US-SCI-NEW

	   A summary of financial and business news from The Associated
Press at 0000 GMT. Stories carry ``f'' or ``i'' category codes and
move on this circuit in expanded form:
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Oil stocks barely kept the Dow aloft Thursday
while the broad market sagged for a fourth straight session amid a
flurry of profit-taking. The Dow Jones industrial average bobbed
higher just before the close, ending a three-day losing streak, but
rose just 5.92 points to 8,829.74 despite gaining as much as 84 in
the morning. Most broad-market measures extended a weeklong retreat
that's been extremely tame compared with the gains of the past
month. (US-CLOSING STOCKS)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The dollar rose Thursday as investors sought
safer assets as U.S. military forces moved closer to Iraq in
preparation for a possible attack against Saddam Hussein. The
dollar also rose initially against the yen because of
disappointment with a fiscal stimulus package Japanese leaders were
offering. Against the yen, the dollar was quoted at 121.98 yen in
late New York trading, up from 121.72 late Wednesday. The U.S.
currency also was changing hands at 1.6832 marks, up from 1.6764.
(US-DOLLAR)
	   STUTTGART, Germany (AP) _ Daimler-Benz confirmed the completion
of its merger with Chrysler on Thursday, creating the world's
third-largest automobile company based on 1997 revenues and an
industrial group valued at dlrs 75 billion. The dlrs 75 billion
reflects the total worth of the merged company including their
vehicle and non-vehicle divisions. The price of the stock
transaction for the merger was put at dlrs 37 billion. The new
DaimlerChrysler AG will have operational headquarters in Stuttgart,
Germany and in Auburn Hills, Michigan. (GERMANY-DAIMLERCHRYSLER,
US-DAIMLERCHRYSLER)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Europe's new central bank won't try to contest
the dollar's international dominance with its new euro currency,
the bank's president said Thursday. ``There will be no deliberate
policy of challenging the U.S. dollar,'' Wim Duisenberg said in the
text of a speech to the Economic Club of New York. The new central
bank, he said, ``will accept the international role of the euro as
it develops through market forces.'' Still, Duisenberg said the
euro, which will be launched Jan. 1 in 11 of the 15 European Union
nations, will be a major world currency. The European Central Bank
``will have an important international role to play,'' Duisenberg
said, noting that one-fourth of the world's currency reserves are
held in European currencies that will merge into the euro.
(GERMANY-EURO-DOLLAR)
	   LONDON (AP) _ Royal Dutch Shell followed up last month's gloomy
assessment of the oil industry by announcing Thursday that it would
cut 3,000 jobs across Europe. Specifics of where the cuts would
take place were not announced, but the oil giant said last month it
planned to close big offices that run its operations in Britain,
the Netherlands, France and Germany, leaving employees in smaller,
decentralized offices to deal directly with headquarters. Shell
foreshadowed the cuts in September 1997 when it unveiled plans to
shed 15 percent of the company's European work force.
(BRITAIN-SHELL LAYOFFS)
	   DUESSELDORF, Germany (AP) _ SAirGroup AG, parent of Swissair and
other carriers, advanced its goal of forging a European holiday
flight group Thursday by acquiring a 49.9 percent stake in
Germany's LTU Group. SAirGroup declined to reveal the value of the
stake, but German media have placed it at about 2 billion marks
(dlrs 1.25 billion). German investors own the remaining stake.
SAirGroup said it will finance the transaction with its own cash
flow and proceeds from the prior sale of four hotels in the United
States. LTU, with total annual sales of close to 5 billion marks
(dlrs 3.1 billion), ran a minuscule operating profit last year. But
SAirGroup had its sights on LTU's 29 aircraft and its 2 billion
marks (dlrs 1.25 billion) in annual leisure flight revenues, to
complement its own small charter operations and those of its
allies. (GERMANY-LTU-SWISSAIR)
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's ruling party presented a new recession
rescue blueprint Thursday, but the stimulus package _ Japan's
largest ever _ failed to lift gloom among business leaders and
economists. The United States and other nations have been
pressuring Japan to show more initiative in halting its economic
slide and leading the region out of crisis. Instead of hope,
however, Thursday's dlrs 147 billion tax cut and spending proposal
was greeted by a sharp fall in Tokyo's main stock index, skepticism
among economic analysts, and widespread indifference on local news
broadcasts. (JAPAN-ECONOMY)

 &UR; Eds: Items are on mariachi singer Vicente Fernandez, conductor Kurt
Masur, lovesick fish off Norway, and Jack Nicholson and Paul
McCartney. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ A mariachi singer who was discovered on a
farm in Mexico and went on to sell more than 60 million records is
being walked on in Hollywood.
	   Hundreds of fans crowded around mariachi singer Vicente
Fernandez on Wednesday as he was honored with a star on the
Hollywood Walk of Fame.
	   Fernandez's ``ranchera'' songs have made him one of the most
famous stars in Mexico and among Hispanics worldwide.
	   His hit songs include ``El Rey,'' ``Las Llaves De Mi Alma,''
``De Que Manera Te Olvido'' and ``Me Voy A Quitar De En Medio.''
	   Fernandez started singing serenades for small amounts of money
while working at a farm. He has since recorded 53 albums during a
career that spans more than three decades.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The New York Philharmonic's Kurt Masur is
becoming principal conductor of the London Philharmonic, starting
in 2000.
	   Masur said his second post will not interfere with his
commitment to the New York Philharmonic, where he has been music
director for seven years.
	   Masur's appointment in London is for five years. His contract in
New York was recently extended to 2002.
	   ``I love this orchestra very much,'' the 71-year-old Masur said
Wednesday of the London Philharmonic, which has been leaderless
since Franz Welser-Most left in 1995. ``The London orchestras are
having problems, and I will do everything I can to help them.''
	   New York Philharmonic players said Wednesday that Masur had told
them about his new job in October while they were touring Germany.
	   Holding two jobs is no novelty to Masur. He had served as
director of the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra while at the New York
Philharmonic.
	   He gave up the Leipzig post two years ago after a 26-year
association.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   OSLO, Norway (AP) _ The Norwegian navy's submarine corps has run
into an unexpected problem _ lovesick fish _ during dives off the
nation's coast.
	   Teeming schools of passionate cod, in the midst of a frenzied
mating season, make so much noise that the submarines' sonar can't
hear anything else, making it almost impossible to navigate under
the cold waters of the Norwegian Sea, a defense study said
Thursday.
	   The cod grunt repeatedly to attract potential mates.
	   ``This is the first time we have registered the frequency of
sounds from wild cod,'' researcher Erling Kjellsby was quoted as
telling Norway's largest newspaper, Verdens Gang. ``The noise of
cod looking for partners ruins the listening conditions.''
	   The study by the Norwegian Defense Research Institute said the
fish grunts overload sonar systems, and mask sound waves that sonar
transmits to detect objects underwater.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LOS ANGELES (AP) _ Jack Nicholson has put a home he owns on the
market for dlrs 2.5 million.
	   Nicholson, the most nominated actor in the history of the
Academy Awards with 11, bought the Beverly Hills five-bedroom home
in 1991 for about dlrs 2 million, the Los Angeles Times reported
Thursday.
	   Nicholson, who won Oscars for ``As Good As It Gets,'' ``Terms of
Endearment'' and ``One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' continues to
live in a nearby home that he has owned since the 1960s.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LONDON (AP) _ Sir Paul McCartney said he will be dedicating an
American rock and roll honor to his late wife.
	   The former Beatle is to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall
of Fame as a solo artist. McCartney is already in the hall as a

Argentine president sends islanders reconciliation letter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Argentina's president sent a
letter to the Falkland islanders on Thursday, advocating
reconciliation between his country and the South Atlantic
archipelago Argentina invaded in 1982.
	   Britain repealed the invasion after a 74-day war in which nearly
1,000 servicemen from both sides died. The two countries restored
relations in 1990, but Argentines cannot travel to the islands.
	   Returning from a recent state visit to London, President Carlos
Menem wrote the islanders he hoped his trip would ``create the best
possible expectations for cooperation and brotherhood in our common
South Atlantic space.''
	   Menem addressed the islanders as ``sisters and brothers'' and
said he hoped that the ``spirit of reconciliation is the necessary
way to close the wounds opened by the deplorable 1982 war.''
	   The letter is scheduled to appear in Friday's edition of the
islands weekly newspaper Penguin News.

Canadian military taking no chances with Millennium Bug
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DAVID CRARY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TORONTO (AP) _ Imagine a sudden series of blackouts across the
vast expanse of Canada in the depths of a frigid winter, coupled
with a breakdown in air travel and phone service.
	   Far-fetched, perhaps, but Canada's armed forces are drawing up
detailed plans to cope with such a scenario, just in case the
Millennium Bug really does wreak havoc with vital computer systems
on Jan. 1, 2000.
	   The effort is called Operation Abacus, after the ancient Chinese
calculator that is glitch-proof and hand-powered. A 24-page order
sent to military commanders and reserve units across Canada
instructs them to give top priority to the planning.
	   In the past 18 months, Canada's military has become a specialist
in handling domestic natural disasters. It conducted its
biggest-ever peacetime deployments in response to the 1997 Red
River flood in Manitoba and a crippling ice storm in Quebec and
Ontario last January.
	   The Millennium Bug could spawn chaos requiring an even bigger
deployment _ or cause virtually no disruption at all. The problem
lies in the dating system used by many computers. If they are not
corrected, the computers may read Jan. 1, 2000 as Jan. 1, 1900.
	   The military is taking no chances.
	   Planning ranges from use-of-force guidelines in case looting
breaks out to the potential need for extra flashlights and
batteries in the event of widespread power outages.
	   ``You're trying to prepare for just about everything that could
go wrong,'' said Lt. Cmdr. Jeff Agnew, spokesman for Operation
Abacus. ``It could be pretty cold _ so you could be called upon to
do a lot of things.''
	   The official worst-case scenario calls for deployment of 32,000
soldiers, including reservists.
	   Logistics units are calculating where to position vehicles,
fuel, tents and other supplies. Communications officers are
studying ways to keep authorities in contact with one another if
the telephone system breaks down. Navy ships might be used as
barracks, power plants, field hospitals and soup kitchens.
	   ``What we bring that no one else can is a national command and
control structure,'' Agnew said.
	   ``We have communications facilities and we have people in every
province in the country in large numbers. We deal with large
problems on a daily basis, we're trained in it.''
	   Other security forces also are planning ahead.
	   The Royal Canadian Mounted Police has barred its 16,000 officers
from taking leave between Dec. 27, 1999, and March 15, 2000, at
least until the scope of any potential problems becomes clearer.
Toronto and Vancouver police officers have been given no-leave
dates of about two weeks.
	   ``We want all of our officers to be available,'' said Sgt. Mike
Gaudet at the Mounties' headquarters. ``We're not looking at this
as being doomsday or alarmist. We're talking about being
prepared.''
	   Opposition politicians questioned last week whether the military
was on the right track after an interim federal report said the
Defense Department was lagging behind most other federal agencies
in adjusting its own computers.
	   ``I now have my doubts about whether the army can even get out
of their barracks in 2000,'' said Parliament member John Williams
of the right-wing Reform Party.
	   But the federal experts monitoring the situation said they were
confident the Defense Department would iron out problems in its
most vital systems by June.
	   A poll commissioned by Canada's industry department suggests
most Canadians are not worried by the Millennium Bug.
	   Almost 80 percent of those polled last month were confident
government and business can avert any significant problems. Only 5
percent of the 2,000 people polled predicted a crisis, while 18
percent said the bug will create serious problems.
	   The poll's margin of error was 2.8 percentage points.

Redressing the balance: Urban renewal in eastern Paris
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photos NY321-322, Graphic PARIS RENEWAL &QL; 
 &UR; By MARILYN AUGUST &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ In its most ambitious urban renewal project since
the 19th century, Paris is reclaiming a vast swath of wasteland
that for decades has been home to rusting factories and railroad
tracks.
	   Urban planners hope the 25-year, 18-billion-franc (dlrs 3.3
billion) program will turn the no-man's land in the city's
southeastern corner into a new ``Left Bank'' to rival the historic
Latin Quarter in central Paris.
	   The project, ``Paris Rive Gauche,'' will ``reintegrate this
traditional working-class neighborhood into the city center and
give Paris the balance it's been lacking,'' said Jacques Toubon, a
former justice minister who heads Semapa, the building consortium
overseeing the project.
	   The area stretches 2.7 kilometers (about 1 1-2 miles) along the
Seine in a southward sweep from the Austerlitz train station down
to the city's beltway.
	   Until the new National Library opened in the district two years
ago, it wasn't even on the Paris map.
	   Since then, the neighborhood has come gradually to life. And
slowly, it's getting a soul.
	   Art galleries, upscale cafes, restaurants and boutiques have
cropped up on vacant land crisscrossed by the train tracks that
once formed a divider between the Seine on one side and a bustling
blue-collar neighborhood on the other.
	   Over the years, small industry moved out to the suburbs and
artisans closed their doors. Today, more than 30 percent of the
district's inhabitants travel long distances to jobs across Paris.
	   Commuting had been a nightmare, with long hikes to the nearest
subway stop and two or more train changes needed to reach the city
center.
	   But on Oct. 15, a new high-speed subway line began shuttling
commuters directly to the central Madeleine area, crossing the
Seine with stops at the Bercy sports arena, the Gare de Lyon and
Chatelet.
	   Planners say the new line is the key to overhauling eastern
Paris, making it more attractive to business, industry and private
citizens.
	   ``This project will lead to the creation of 50,000 new jobs by
2115,'' said Toubon, who also is mayor of the 13th Arrondissement,
the district that encompasses the area.
	   Paris Rive Gauche is the boldest urban renewal project since the
mid-1850s, when Baron Georges Haussman razed more than 20,000
squalid dwellings in the city's medieval heart to improve
sanitation and carve out stately, tree-lined boulevards wide enough
for cannon to quell any urban insurrection.
	   Haussman's obsession with linear order led to the construction
of 40,000 homes for the burgeoning middle class, and ended up
pushing the poor to the periphery, where they remain today.
	   Until Haussman's overhaul drove the poor out, all Paris
neighborhoods had virtually the same social composition _ the
working class lived side-by-side with the bourgeoisie, even in the
same buildings.
	   ``Paris Rive Gauche is an attempt to redress the social balance,
to undo what Haussman did,'' Toubon said in an interview.
	   The Parisian cityscape has changed little since Haussman's day,
with two notable exceptions: high-rise business complexes at the
Front de Seine in the 15th Arrondissement, and La Defense, on the
city's western edge.
	   Paris Rive Gauche has received broad support across political
lines since its inception in the early 1990s.
	   The project, which is bigger in scope than the Disneyland Paris
complex east of Paris, includes plans for building university
facilities on the site of an old flour warehouse and a teaching
hospital.
	   Hair salons, a movie complex with 13 theaters, restaurants,
parking and subsidized housing overlooking the Seine will go up.
	   Urban planners, following in Haussman's legacy, have laid out
their own main drag over the crumbling tracks. When completed, the
Avenue de France will be 40 meters (120 feet) wide and lined with
apartment and office buildings.
	   A footbridge will connect the National Library with newly
planted gardens at the Parc de Bercy across the river.
	   Even the ``bateaux mouches'' cruising the Seine with tourists
will pass by.

Peruvians put faith in `Andean X-Ray' to diagnose ailments
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By DAVID KOOP &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ In a dank basement under a shop of religious
statues in a Lima slum, Indian faith healer El Tuno rubs a
squealing ``cuy,'' an Andean guinea pig, over the body of a naked
male patient.
	   With his long black hair and beard flecked with gray, El Tuno,
whose real name is Adrian Vera, whispers an ancestral prayer and
spits a mixture of cane liquor and herbs grown in the Andes over
the patient's trembling body to ``open his pores'' to the cuy's
power.
	   Vera, who has practiced the medicine of his Incan forebears for
25 years, then kills the cuy with a ritual knife, slices it open
and ``reads'' its entrails to diagnose the patient's ailment in a
kind of ``Andean X-ray.''
	   Despite the spread of modern medicine in Peru, millions of
impoverished people put their faith in the age-old Andean practice
of ``passing the cuy,'' which has grown in popularity in recent
decades.
	   ``In the past, passing the cuy was a largely rural custom. But
with the explosive growth of Peru's cities, not only has it not
disappeared, it has prospered and grown in the shantytowns,'' said
historian Pablo Macera.
	   According to Andean medical lore, when a faith healer rubs a cuy
over the body, the patient's ailments pass on to the cuy and the
healer can make a diagnosis by looking at the cuy's organs. If the
patient has a stomach tumor, for example, a tumor or lump
supposedly will appear in the cuy's stomach.
	   Faith healers also claim the cuy possesses curative powers,
absorbing the negative energy caused by ``damage'' and ``fright,''
the basic causes of disease according to Andean belief.
	   Peru's poor majority can rarely afford private medical care and
distrust low-quality state services. Many prefer the less expensive
rituals and remedies made from native plants offered by the Indian
healers, despite the lack of scientific evidence that it works.
	   ``It's a very old, deeply rooted belief in Peru, but there is no
scientific evidence that it works beyond a placebo affect,'' said
Dr. Fernando Cabieses, director of Peru's National Institute of
Traditional Medicine.
	   Booths of Indian faith healers _ called ``chamanes,'' Spanish
for shamans _ dot dusty, bustling street markets across Peru,
offering the cuy ritual, herbal medicines and love potions. The
``operating room'' is often a dirt floor and stool surrounded by a
ragged curtain.
	   Victor Reyna, a chemistry professor at the National Engineering
University, recently published the first study of the cuy ritual.
	   ``What surprised me was how common it was. Among ordinary
Peruvians, almost every family I studied had at least one member
who had been diagnosed with a cuy,'' Reyna said.
	   The medicine of Peru's pre-Columbian Indians combined religion,
ritual and remedies based on native plants, he said. The use of the
cuy, an animal sacred to pre-Columbian cultures, can be seen in
ceramics, tapestries and murals in Peru's highlands and coastal
desert dating back thousands of years, he added.
	   Bertha Jimenez, a bookkeeper, went to a faith healer with a
persistent stomach ache after her doctor wanted to pass a fiber
optic tube down her throat to look inside. The healer passed the
cuy over her.
	   ``When he cut open the cuy, he found a diseased piece of flesh
among its intestines,'' she said. ``He took it out and I felt
better.''
	   Like many Peruvians, Jimenez professes a belief in modern
medicine, but is not willing to discard Andean medical lore,
including the powers of the cuy.
	   If a child has a bad scare, such as narrowly avoiding an
accident, parents often have a shaman pass a cuy or egg over the
child to remove the ``fright.'' They believe that if it remains
within the child it will fester and cause medical or psychological
problems.
	   Reyna recalls one Indian faith healer who passed the cuy over
him, then hurled the animal hard against the concrete floor. When
the stunned cuy did not die and slowly began to move, the healer
pronounced Reyna healthy.
	   ``It's a combination of faith and magic that has deep roots in
Peru, deeper than modern medicine in many areas,'' Reyna said.

Graf to meet Novotna in first round of season-ending tournament
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By BOB GREENE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Jana Novotna has no one to blame but herself.
	   Participating in the draw ceremony, the defending champion
selected Steffi Graf as her first-round opponent in the next week's
season-ending dlrs 2 million Chase Championships.
	   ``Sure it makes a difference _ a huge difference,'' Novotna said
of the luck of the draw. ``But if you want to win a tournament like
this, you have to beat the top players.''
	   Graf didn't make the select 16-player singles field until after
the Thursday's draw was completed at Madison Square Garden. She was
assured a spot when Monica Seles defeated Japan's Ai Sugiyama 6-3,
7-5 in a second-round match in the Advanta Championships in
Philadelphia. Sugiyama could have qualified by reaching the final
in Philadelphia.
	   ``Now she's back again and I have to play her first round,''
Novotna said of Graf, a five-time winner of the Championships, the
last time in 1996.
	   The tournament lost Venus Williams, who would have been the
fifth seed, on Thursday due to a recurring knee problem.
	   ``On my way up here today, I was thinking about the draw and I
thought, `I hope that I'm not going to draw Graf. She's going to be
a dangerous floater,''' Novotna said. ``Look who ended up with the
floater.''
	   A year ago, Novotna came into the Chase Championships as the
best player in women's tennis who had never won a major.
	   ``This tournament is like the fifth Grand Slam,'' Novotna said
Thursday. ``You have all the top players here.''
	   Winning the Championships improved her confidence so much, she
believes, that she capped it by winning Wimbledon in July.
	   ``It was very special,'' she said. ``It was the beginning of
something special.''
	   The Chase Championships will wrap up ``the most interesting year
in women's tennis in a decade,'' said Novotna, who is ranked third
in the world and will be the No. 3 seed.
	   ``There was a period when a player dominated _ Steffi, Monica,
Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert _ when they won everything,''
Novotna said. ``Now it's wide open. Anybody can win any tournament.
Anyone can win a Grand Slam.''
	   Fourteen players had already clinched berths in the tournament
when the draw was held. When Seles beat Sugiyama, Irina Spirlea and
Graf tooks spots 15 and 16.
	   Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario drew Spirlea in the first round.
	   Top-seeded Lindsay Davenport opens against Sandrine Testud of
France, who beat the top-ranked American in their last meeting last
month. Davenport holds a 6-2 career edge, but the two have split
the last four.
	   The seedings are the same as their world rankings for the first
four players: Davenport, Martina Hingis, Novotna and
Sanchez-Vicario. Seles, who is ranked No. 6 in the world, became
the No. 5 seed when Williams withdrew.
	   Seeded sixth is Mary Pierce, followed by Conchita Martinez and
Nathalie Tauziat.
	   Other first-round pairings have Hingis against Swiss Fed Cup
teammate Patty Schnyder, Seles against Russia's Anna Kournikova,
Pierce against Amanda Coetzer of South Africa, Martinez against
Belgium's Dominique Van Roost and Nathalie Tauziat of France
against Natasha Zvereva of Belarus.
	   In doubles, top-seeded Hingis and Novotna will play Yayuk Basuki
of Indonesia and Caroline Vis of the Netherlands; No. 2 Davenport
and Zvereva will play Kournikova and Latvia's Larisa Neiland; No. 3
Lisa Raymond of Wayne, Pennsylvania and Australia's Rennae Stubbs
will play Martinez and Argentina's Patricia Tarabini; and No. 4
Tauziat and countrywoman Alexandra Fusai will play Sugiyama and
Russia's Elena Likhovtseva.
	   The singles winner will collect dlrs 500,000, the victorious
doubles team dlrs 100,000 apiece.

Taylor misses magazine's World XI
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian captain Mark Taylor has
missed selection in a hypothetical World XI chosen by readers of
leading cricket magazine Wisden Monthly.
	   The side was chosen before Taylor scored a record 334 last month
while leading Australia to its first series win in Pakistan for 39
years.
	   Wisden's readers gave the captaincy of their team to Taylor's
vice-captain Steve Waugh, who leads Australia's limited-overs team.
	   Australia had the most representatives of any nation, with
legspinner Shane Warne and paceman Glenn McGrath joining Waugh in
the XI.
	   As a player, Waugh was the third most popular pick and he
slotted into the side at No.7, with England captain and
wicketkeeper Alec Stewart bumped up the order to No.4. World record
holder Ian Healy missed out on the keeping selection to Stewart,
who is a better batsman.
	   Taylor was opener and captain of the 1996 Wisden World XI but
for the second year running he was relegated to leadership of the
World second XI.
	   Indian star Sachin Tendulkar was the most heavily favored player
with 837 votes, ahead of South African speedster Allan Donald (839)
and Waugh (786).
	   As captain, Waugh was the choice of 217 readers to comfortably
beat Tendulkar on 111 and Stewart on 103.
	   Warne polled 27 per cent fewer votes than when fully fit in 1996
but he still made the team with 606 votes.
	   The team, in batting order, is: Sanath Jayasuriya (Sri Lanka),
Mike Atherton (England), Brian Lara (West Indies), Alec Stewart
(England), Sachin Tendulkar (India), Aravinda de Silva (Sri Lanka),
Steve Waugh (captain, Australia), Shane Warne (Australia), Muttiah
Muralitharan (Pakistan), Allan Donald (South Africa), Glenn McGrath
(Australia).
	   Asked to predict next year's World Cup winner, readers of the
English-based magazine chose Commonwealth Games gold medallist
South Africa (275 votes) before Sri Lanka (267) and Australia
(203).
	   Not one reader picked New Zealand _ but a few opted for Scotland
and Bangladesh.

Mariners lose Mike Timlin, sign Jose Mesa
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By JIM COUR &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SEATTLE (AP) _ Unwilling to meet Mike Timlin's price, the
Seattle Mariners have replaced him with Jose Mesa.
	   The Mariners announced Thursday that they've signed Mesa, 32, to
a two-year contract with a club option for the 2001 season. Details
of the reliever's contract were not disclosed.
	   ``Mesa will be our closer next season,'' manager Lou Piniella
said. ``He has a proven record of success, and I'm confident he'll
do a good job for us. We're pleased to have him in Seattle.''
	   The announcement on Mesa came after Timlin, 32, the Mariners'
closer the second half of their disappointing 1998 season, was
signed to a dlrs 16 million, four-year contract with the Baltimore
Orioles.
	   ``Our priority this offseason is upgrading our bullpen,'' said
Woody Woodward, Seattle's vice president of baseball operations.
	   On Monday, the Mariners traded left-hander Paul Spoljaric to the
Philadelphia Phillies for Mark Leiter, 35.
	   Timlin had 19 saves in a career-high 70 games for the Mariners
last season. He said he wanted to return to Seattle, but the
Mariners allowed him to test free agency.
	   Timlin had a strong second half for a Mariners' bullpen that
blew 21 save chances last season, when the Mariners were 76-85.
	   Woodward explained the additions of Mesa and Leiter, and the
subtractions of Timlin and Spoljaric.
	   ``We wanted more depth and more pitchers that have had
success,'' he said. ``With Mesa, and previously with Leiter, we
feel we are getting deeper in the bullpen although I am still
willing to add more to the mix.''
	   Mesa started last season with Cleveland and finished it in San
Francisco. After being traded to the Giants, he was 5-3 with a 3.52
ERA in 32 appearances. With the Indians, with whom he pitched since
1992, he was 3-4 with a 5.17 ERA in 44 games with one save.
	   Mesa's best seasons came in 1995 (46 saves) and '96 (39 saves)
with the Indians. He had 16 saves for the Indians in '97.

Nigerian youths take oil workers hostage
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Recaps previous to CORRECT style on Texaco to Inc., sted Co.,
CLARIFIES that company based in New York but spokesman in Houston;
ADDS name of contractor. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ Armed youths stormed an offshore oil
exploration rig used by Texaco Inc. near southern Nigeria and took
seven foreigners and a Nigerian hostage, a Texaco official said
Thursday.
	   Three Americans are among the hostages, Paul Weeditz, a
spokesman for the White Plains, New York, company.
	   A Briton, a South African, an Italian and a Croatian were also
taken along with the Nigerian oil worker, said Weeditz, speaking
from Houston.
	   ``There were no injuries we know of and no damage to the rig,''
Weeditz said.
	   A Texaco official in Nigeria, who spoke on condition of
anonymity, said the hostages were taken at gunpoint Wednesday from
the drilling rig by a boatload of youths from the Ijaw ethnic group
and ferried ashore.
	   ``They were taken to an undisclosed location and are being held
until a ransom is paid,'' the official said. The official said the
youths were also demanding improved infrastruture facilities for
their communities in the poverty-ridden Niger River delta region.
	   Officials at the U.S. Embassy in Nigeria's commercial capital of
Lagos were unavailable for comment.
	   Oil companies, including Shell and Chevron, are frequently the
targets of protests and occasionally hostage-takings as local
communities vent their anger over what they see as government and
the oil company neglect for their plight.
	   Although Nigeria is one of the world's largest oil producers,
the people who live in the oil-rich Niger delta often exist in
subsistence poverty in communities without electricity or running
water.
	   Shell in recent weeks was forced to temporarily shut down
several oil pumping relay stations after armed youths stormed the
facilities and demanded compensation from the government.
	   Texaco says the workers taken on Wednesday were contract
employees working for other oil service companies hired to conduct
exploratory drilling in the region.
	   Texaco's Weeditz said the company's Nigerian subsidiary, Texaco
Overseas Petroleum Co., was coordinating with local authorities and
the police.
	   ``We're working through the federal, state and local governments
in Nigeria to address the situation just as we would any where
else, Weeditz said. ``We treat any instance involving our
operations with great care.''
	   Weeditz said several contractors were involved, including Noble
Drilling Co. of Houston. Noble Drilling officials declined comment.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ The television screen flashes images of
Saddam Hussein visiting a village home, receiving bouquets from
schoolgirls and greeting tribal leaders who wave Kalashnikov rifles
aloft.
	   All the while, pop singer Habib Ali croons in praise of the
Iraqi president: ``You are the symbol of Iraqi pride ... the leader
of leaders.''
	   It's the regular diet on Baghdad TV, but in times of crisis like
the current standoff over U.N. arms inspections, this programing by
the government media becomes a positive feast.
	   All the state-run media _ including three TV stations, six daily
newspapers and two radio station _ speak with one voice to
galvanize the public behind the regime and blame the United States
for Iraq's woes.
	   They have almost no competition, since satellite dishes are
forbidden and foreign publications stopped coming into Iraq after
U.N. trade sanctions were imposed eight years ago.
	   On Thursday, Iraq's newspapers didn't even mention that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and U.S. President Clinton had
appealed to Saddam to renew cooperation with U.N. weapons
inspectors.
	   Instead, all front pages carried photos of Saddam meeting with
his Cabinet and his military commanders.
	   Al-Qadassiya's red banner headline warned of an ``American and
Zionist strike against our people,'' while the ruling party's
Al-Thawra newspaper accused the United States of ``psychological
warfare'' against Iraq.
	   Khudeir ad-Duleimi, the London-educated editor of the country's
only English-language paper, The Baghdad Observer, says a united
front behind the government is ``natural'' in a crisis.
	   In the West, he said, ``Things work without the need for direct
intervention. In crisis, the media there have their limits as
well.''
	   The penalties for not toeing the government line can be heavy.
Last summer, Iraqi journalist Dawoud al-Farhan lost his job and
spent a month in jail after writing a column criticizing the
regime's handling of the economy.
	   About the only alternative sources of news are radio broadcasts
from nearby countries _ including the Arabic service of Israel
radio _ and by the British Broadcasting Corp., Voice of America and
the Paris-based Radio Monte Carlo.
	   Although the Iraqi TV stations follow the same political line,
they are quite different in content.
	   Baghdad Television and its sister satellite channel are the main
conduits the government uses to get its message out to the public.
	   To appeal to old-fashioned patriotism _ and to remind the Arab
world of a debt due _ they recently ran a documentary series on the
Iraqi army's role in supporting Egypt and Syria in their 1973 war
against Israel.
	   Shabab Television, owned by Saddam's son Odai, has another task,
too _ providing entertainment to counter the drab life under U.N.
sanctions.
	   It carries cartoons, soap operas, pop music shows and the latest
movies. An apparently pirated videotape of ``Titanic'' was aired by
Shabab when the block-buster film was just getting into American
theaters.
	   Many Iraqis say they would love to get outside TV stations _ if
only for entertainment _ but acknowledge that they can't afford the
risk.
	   Satellite dishes are banned, except for government officials. A
violator faces a fine of up to 500,000 Iraqi dinars (dlrs 285) _
the equivalent of eight years' wages for some _ and six months in
jail.
	   And police confiscate the dish.

Stern: In hindsight, 2 1/2 weeks ago was time for deal
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By CHRIS SHERIDAN &QC; 
 &UR; AP Basketball Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ The National Basketball Association lockout
might have ended 2 1/2 weeks ago, the night David Stern and Michael
Jordan sat across from each other at the bargaining table with a
chance to save an 82-game season.
	   ``I've been doing this for 30 years, and I'm used to negotiating
through the night. At 1 a.m. I was just getting started,'' Stern
said Thursday.
	   But instead of working through the night while Jordan's stretch
limousine idled outside in the rain, the sides broke off talks to
get a good night's sleep.
	   Since then, they've only moved further apart.
	   ``I wouldn't say we were close to a deal, but we were on track.
We were trying,'' Stern said, referring to the 8 1/2-hour
bargaining session Oct. 28 that followed a joint meeting of owners
and players.
	   ``I thought since I had the owners in and the players in, it
seemed to be a good time,'' Stern said. ``I thought we were making
progress, but it was clear that they were going to reject whatever
number we were going to come up with.''
	   And so ended what Stern considered to be the one chance both
sides had to bring a somewhat dignified end to their stalemate.
	   The lockout reached its 133rd day Thursday. The entire November
schedule has been lost, half of the December schedule is gone and
it appears the sides won't make a deal on a new collective
bargaining agreement until the last possible moment.
	   When that moment occur _ Dec. 10? Dec. 25? Jan. 4? _ is anyone's
guess.
	   In an hour-long interview with The Associated Press in his Fifth
Avenue office, Stern refused to set a drop-dead date for saving the
regular season, but said some owners already were gung-ho to scrap
it.
	   Stern also expressed dismay at the rhetoric coming from the
players' union and said the All-Star game won't be canceled simply
to squeeze in extra games.
	   ``The question is not whether we'll cancel the season but
whether we'll make a deal,'' Stern said, ``because if we don't make
a deal the season will not be played.
	   ``They have told us that unless we are prepared to continue
paying the same percentage that we're currently paying, then they
are prepared to have the season canceled. So they haven't given the
owners much of an option. They have thrown down a gauntlet.
	   ``As far as I'm concerned, the enormity of the losses that we're
suffering should require us to be negotiating now, but we just
can't seem to get it done. We can't get to first base.''
	   Stern and union director Billy Hunter were supposed to speak by
telephone Wednesday night or Thursday morning to discuss whether to
return to the bargaining table, but the call had not arrived as of
mid-afternoon.
	   No formal talks have been held since last Friday, and the full
bargaining teams including owners and players haven't been in the
same room since the night Jordan showed up.
	   ``They said `Don't even try if you're not going to come up way
higher' (on the percentage),'' Stern said. ``That was the
dilemma.''
	   So everybody walked away.
	   The players have since said they won't return to the table until
the owners are ready to give ground. And Hunter says many players
and agents believe he has already put too many concessions on the
table _ a luxury tax, escrow tax, reduction in annual salary cap
increases and a lengthier rookie salary scale.
	   Stern said the owners would stand to lose more than dlrs 400
million if the season was canceled, while the players would lose
dlrs 1 billion in salaries.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Despite sweeping U.N. trade sanctions,
shops in Baghdad are full of new computers with Pentium processors,
American-made IBMs, laser printers and fax machines. Gleaming new
Toyotas and Mercedes sit in auto showrooms.
	   All these goods are illegal under Security Council sanctions,
imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, which ban almost all
trade with the country. But that hardly seems to matter to those
making money on them.
	   The main customers for computers include Iraqi universities and
other state-owned enterprises, dealers in Baghdad say. Some of the
imported vehicles go the government, but most are bought by rich
Iraqis.
	   At the Safwan auto showroom in downtown Baghdad, owner Mohammed
Muhsen stood before a line of new Toyota pickup trucks.
	   ``This 1999 model we offer for dlrs 14,000,'' Muhsen said. ``Our
problem is not the import of new cars but finding buyers who can
pay.''
	   But there are those who can afford the price, because the U.N.
sanctions _ while impoverishing the vast number of Iraqis with
their ban on oil exports _ also have created a new class of rich.
	   The state-controlled economy has broken down, opening the way
for entrepreneurs who smuggle goods into the country without the
nicety of customs duties _ meaning autos and other imports are far
cheaper in Iraq than in other Middle Eastern countries.
	   The smugglers get a push from the government since, in its
effort to fight the sanctions, it has removed most hurdles on
imported goods that cannot be brought in under the oil-for-food
deal with the United Nations.
	   To draw money into the country, the government encourages
traders to export domestic goods such as dates, hides and cement,
and even gives incentives to those shipping oil products to
neighboring countries.
	   Muhsen says most cars enter Iraq through Jordan _ which, despite
the trade barriers, keeps an open border with Iraq and depends on
it for a sizable chunk of its foreign trade.
	   All manner of vehicles come in. The government recently supplied
its police forces with Korean-made Hyundai cars which, according to
Muhsen, cost dlrs 10,000 in Baghdad. Auto dealer Hamdan al-Saadi
even has 1998 Mercedes for dlrs 30,000.
	   The dealers declined to say how many new vehicles enter Iraq
each year, but stressed that they could supply up to 100 on
request.
	   ``We go with the times,'' al-Saadi said. ``When relations are
smooth with U.N. weapons inspectors we sell a lot. During crisis,
business almost comes to a standstill.''
	   But it seems Iraq's current crisis with the inspectors has had
little impact on the computer market. ``Demand is high right now,
although prices are dear in Iraqi terms,'' said Baha George, who
runs a computer shop.
	   ``I have Windows 1998. I have the latest programs which we copy
and sell for a maximum of dlrs 5,'' he said.
	   ``We are under sanctions. We do not care for copyright,'' he
added.
	   George said he also has the latest Pentium chips, scanners and
graphics programs in his shop opposite Baghdad's University of
Technology, where up to 16,000 students study engineering and
computer science.
	   In the past, even buying a typewriter required official
permission, George said. But now, he said, the government has
scrapped all controls on owning computers.
	   New computer shops are sprouting up, and Muhened al-Hadithi, who
displayed U.S.-made parts imported from Dubai, said demand was
rising.
	   ``We sell a desktop with Pentium 333 for about dlrs 600 which I
believe is cheaper than anywhere in the Middle East,'' al-Hadithi
said. A similar computer sells for dlrs 1,400 in Egypt.
	   The value of the goods smuggled in and out of Iraq is not known,
since it is difficult to monitor the porous borders. It is also
unclear how much the government earns from the smuggling.
	   Western reports speak of up to 150,000 barrels of oil being
smuggled every day, earning the government up to dlrs 250 million a
year.

Malaysian PM's limelight dimmed by politics, economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ It was meant to be the moment of
glory before he retired.
	   A proud host, standing among the most powerful leaders of the
world, showing off the modern Southeast Asia democracy he has ruled
for 17 years.
	   But Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, 72, goes into the summit of
the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum with his grip weakened
by a political challenge and his image tarnished by allegations of
political intolerance.
	   Several of Mahathir's guests, including U.S. President Bill
Clinton, plan to snub him instead of praising him for forging a
modern nation from a rubber- and tin-producing backwater _ all
because he fired and imprisoned his deputy, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   In the weeks ahead of the Nov. 17-18 summit, Mahathir's
credibility has been battered and attention has focused on
Malaysia's human rights record and its intolerance of dissent.
	   Mahathir's claim to be a champion of the Third World underdog
evaporated the day Anwar appeared in court with a black eye from
police beatings, said Bruce Gale, an analyst in the Singapore-based
Political and Risk Consultancy.
	   ``Mahathir will try to use APEC to show that he is in control of
the situation. That he is not an authoritarian leader on his last
legs,'' said Gale.
	   Anwar, 51, was fired on Sept. 2 and arrested by armed police 18
days later. He is on trial for 10 counts of corruption and illegal
sex acts, charges he calls politically motivated.
	   Mahathir points out that the ruling United Malays National
Organization stood behind his decision to fire Anwar by expelling
him from the powerful party, which has dominated Malaysian politics
since independence from Britain in 1957.
	   ``Mahathir is certainly in control. But if a leader resorts to
the power of coercion, it illustrates his fear and not his
strength,'' said Abdul Razak Baginda, executive director of the
Malaysian Institute of Strategic Research.
	   Mahathir said Thursday he expects Anwar supporters to try to
humiliate him during the summit.
	   ``I'm sure they'll want to demonstrate to show how unstable
Malaysia is,'' he said with customary sarcasm. ``For them, it's a
political issue. They want to make the most of this.''
	   Most Malaysians still unhesitatingly credit Mahathir for the
remarkable progress that the country has made since he took over as
the fourth prime minister in 1981.
	   Few, however, are as prepared to ignore his high-handed methods
as they did when the economy was growing at a steady gallop of 7-8
percent annually for a decade and a middle-class enriched itself
with large homes and more cars.
	   As the country slipped into its first recession in a decade,
sentiments began to change. Then came the political crisis.
	   The high-growth strategy produced the world's tallest building,
but billions of dollars were also lost by state enterprises and
banks through political loans.
	   Since the Asian turmoil, 600 billion ringgit (dlrs 157 billion)
have been lost in market capitalization.
	   All this has turned Mahathir into a reluctant free trader.
	   Many have chided Malaysia for imposing selective capital
controls and fixing the rate of the ringgit instead of allowing the
markets to determine it.
	   Mahathir has said that was needed to insulate the economy from
marauding currency traders, a group he blames for triggering the
economic slowdown. But for the Asian crisis, Malaysia would have
caught up with the industrialized West by 2020, he has said.
	   At the APEC summit, Mahathir could find himself isolated if he
pushes others to accept his prescription of reining in currency
traders with global capital market curbs.
	   Mahathir concedes the economic and political turmoil has made
him weary. He had planned to quit soon after the APEC summit, but
now there's no one to fill his shoes.
	   ``I was planning to step down this year,'' Mahathir said. ``But
this thing has happened and now I cannot step down because I don't
have someone to succeed me.''

Secretary-general has no immediate plans to mediate Iraq crisis
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with quotes from Iraq's deputy prime
minister, Russian minister, new quote from deputy U.S. ambassador &QL; 
 &UR; By EDITH M. LEDERER &QC;

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said he
plans to meet with the U.N. Security Council on Friday but has no
plans at the moment to fly to Baghdad to mediate in the latest Iraq
crisis.
	   As the U.S. sent more warships to the Persian Gulf and
speculation about U.S. airstrikes intensified, Iraq's Deputy Prime
Minister Tariq Aziz said Annan was ``the best person in the world''
to solve the crisis.
	   ``It's his responsibility to do it,'' Aziz told a news
conference in Baghdad.
	   But Annan, who cut short a trip through North Africa and
returned to New York on Thursday afternoon, put a damper on
speculation that he might make another 11th hour trip to Baghdad.
	   ``I have no plans to go to Baghdad at the moment, but I need to
talk to the council members,'' Annan told reporters after he
returned from Morocco.
	   Earlier, U.N. spokesman Fred Eckhard said the secretary-general
``does not at this time see a possible role for himself'' as
mediator in Baghdad.
	   ``That's not to say he would not be available if the council
asked him to do something,'' Eckhard said.
	   But there were no moves by the Security Council to back any
mediation.
	   Even Iraq's usually sympathetic friends on the council _ France,
Russia and China _ weren't pushing for an Annan trip to Baghdad.
	   The council and Annan's office made clear that the onus is on
Iraq to resume cooperation with U.N. weapons inspectors charged
with eliminating Baghdad's weapons of mass destruction.
	   ``The ball is in the Iraqi court to come back into compliance,''
U.S. Deputy Ambassador Peter Burleigh, the current council
president, said Thursday.
	   ``The responsibility is not the secretary-general's, and not the
Security Council's at this point. Both the Security Council and the
secretary-general have made their views crystal clear and what
everyone is waiting for is for the Iraqis to come back into
compliance and rescind their decisions,'' he said.
	   What counts now, Burleigh said, would be a decision by Iraq to
cooperate and ``acts on the ground'' allowing the inspectors to
resume their work.
	   During the last Iraqi crisis in February, the secretary-general
flew to Baghdad and signed a memorandum of understanding with Aziz
to allow unfettered weapons inspections that averted U.S. and
British airstrikes.
	   But Iraq has been reneging on its part of the bargain for
months, and on Oct. 31 it cut all dealings with the weapons
inspectors.
	   Iraq wanted a comprehensive review of its compliance with U.N.
resolutions _ which the Security Council offered _ but not with the
timetable that Baghdad wanted for lifting crippling economic
sanctions imposed after its 1990 invasion of Kuwait. Under the
cease-fire that ended the Gulf War in 1991, the oil embargo against
Iraq cannot be lifted until the weapons inspectors certify that the
country has been disarmed.
	   Eckhard was asked under what conditions Annan might be prepared
to go to Iraq.
	   ``I think first he'd want an indication from the Iraqis that
they're prepared to return to full compliance, and he would want
the support of the council that they would like him to mediate,''
Eckhard responded.
	   At the moment, however, Eckhard said there is no movement, a
very different scenario from the crisis in February.
	   During that standoff, Iraq let it be known through Middle East
leaders ``that they were ready to compromise, and the council
indicated that under the right conditions they might be prepared to
compromise,'' Eckhard said.
	   Annan agreed to mediate and met council members four times to
reach a consensus on what he could discuss with the Iraqis, Eckhard
said.
	   ``So he went with clear, although narrow parameters of what he
could discuss with the Iraqis. And he went with an indication from
the Iraqi side that they were ready to talk. And I don't think he's
got those two conditions today,'' Eckhard said.

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar was lower against the yen early
Friday on local news reports that Japan plans to unveil a
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package. Tokyo stock prices
moved higher.
	   The dollar bought 122.12 yen in early trading, down 1.10 yen
from late Thursday in Tokyo but above its late New York level of
121.98 yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 96.10
points, or 0.68 percent, to 14,171.16 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Thursday, the average closed down 352.96
points, or 2.45 percent.
	   In currency dealings, the dollar's downward move came after the
currency rose as high as 124.08 yen in New York on Thursday _ its
highest level since Oct. 7 _ as investors sought safer assets while
U.S. military forces closed in on Iraq.
	   But the greenback shed some of its early gains later, with the
yen strengthening on a report Japan is readying a stimulus package
even bigger than Thursday's 18 trillion yen (dlrs 147 billion) tax
cut and spending proposal, traders said.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper said Friday that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's package, to be officially announced Monday,
could top 20 trillion yen (dlrs 182 billion).
	   Traders said, however, that the dollar remained firm overall
amid continued speculation the United States may strike Iraq over
its rejection of U.N. nuclear weapons inspections.
	   On the stock market, investors bought back shares following
Thursday's sharp drop, which was attributed to disappointment over
the stimulus package outline.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section was up 4.40 points, or 0.41 percent, to 1,087.33. The TOPIX
closed down 15.19 points, or 1.38 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unquoted in early morning, compared with the previous
day's finish of 0.820 percent. Its price settled at 108.71 yen on
Thursday.

Pinochet arrest hearing ends with judges facing legal minefield
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MAUREEN JOHNSON &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers seeking to have Chile's former dictator
Augusto Pinochet tried on charges his military government committed
genocide, murder and torture have put their case succinctly: That's
no way for any head of state to behave.
	   At the end of a six-day appeal hearing Thursday before Britain's
highest court, all that was clear, however, is that it's not that
simple.
	   Pinochet's lawyers argued in the House of Lords that a British
law giving former heads of state immunity from prosecution is
sufficiently sweeping to protect even Adolf Hitler. They
acknowledged that may be morally regrettable, but insisted it's the
law.
	   However, they conceded that among the several thousand
allegations of secret police brutality during Pinochet's 1973-90
rule, a Spanish judge seeking the general's extradition had
included one case dated after 1988, when Britain signed onto a
convention making torture an offense anywhere.
	   The head of the five-judge tribunal, Lord Justice Gordon Slynn,
called the case ``very difficult'' and gave no indication when the
verdict would be delivered.
	   Lawyers arguing Spain's case had appealed a ruling by England's
High Court holding that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest was illegal
because a 1978 British act gives former heads of state immunity
from prosecution for deeds committed in office.
	   They contended that some crimes are so horrific as to defy
immunity.
	   ``Torture, hostage-taking and crimes against humanity are
conduct which international law has forbidden unequivocally
throughout the period that we are looking at,'' lawyer Christopher
Greenwood told the judges.
	   A Chilean government report says Pinochet's deeds included
responsibility for the deaths or disappearances of some 3,000
people at the hands of secret police after he toppled an elected
Marxist, President Salvador Allende.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, is under police guard in
a London hospital. Chile has protested his arrest, saying the
crisis risks undermining the country's new democracy.
	   A prime argument by prosecutors was that punishing dictators for
crimes against humanity is nothing new in international practice.
They cited special tribunals set up to try Bosnian Serbs and
Rwandan Hutus, and U.N. conventions.
	   Pinochet's lawyers say no ex-head of state has ever been sent
for trial before a foreign court, as opposed to special tribunals _
notably the Nuremberg trials of World War II Nazi leaders.
	   ``Even if there were only one, it would be sufficiently serious
(for extradition), even though it tends to merge into the 4,000 or
so other crimes that are alleged,'' said attorney Alun Jones,
referring to the single post-1988 torture case in the warrant _ the
death by electric torture of a 17-year-old girl.
	   The Spanish judge, seeking to try Pinochet for the deaths of
Spaniards, apparently included that case hoping the torture
convention would overrule the immunity act.
	   The charge says the teen-ager was tortured to death by military
police on Sept. 29, 1989. But in Chile, human rights investigators
said Thursday they could find no trace of the case.
	   Pinochet's lawyers argued that the general's arrest is damaging
to British-Chile relations, and suggested any trial should be in
Chile or before an international tribunal.
	   ``The question in every case in relation to sovereign immunity
is were the acts governmental acts ... in the exercise of
governmental power?'' said attorney Clive Nicholls. ``We say in the
facts of this case, they clearly were, therefore they are subject
to immunity.''
	   Meanwhile, France submitted an extradition warrant for Pinochet
on Thursday, a day after one came from Switzerland.
	   But in Santiago, Chile's deputy foreign minister Mariano
Fernandez said Britain had promised that if the Lords release
Pinochet, it would accept no more warrants.
	   ``A ruling favoring Senator Pinochet would clear the way for his
return home,'' Fernandez told reporters.

Study: Painful birth for baby boys could lead to violent suicide
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By EMMA ROSS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Male infants who experience a traumatic birth may
be more likely to commit suicide by violent means as adults than
other baby boys whose births went smoothly, according to a new
study.
	   Researchers in Sweden who studied the birth records of men who
killed themselves violently found that they were roughly twice as
likely to have been exposed to birth-related trauma, such as an
emergency Caesarean section or forceps delivery.
	   Some researchers, however, voiced caution about the conclusions
of the study of 645 babies, published Friday in this week's issue
of the British Medical Journal.
	   Dr. Chester Schmidt, chairman of the psychiatry department at
Johns Hopkins University's Bayview Medical Center, said the
findings were ``interesting'' but needed to be replicated by other
researchers with larger numbers of subjects and in different
environments.
	   The researchers, Dr. Bertil Jacobson and colleagues at Huddinge
University Hospital, theorize that the suicide risk is linked to
pain. In committing suicide, some people subconsciously want to
recreate the painful sensation of their birth, the study suggests.
	   But Dr. Louis Appleby, a professor of psychiatry at England's
Manchester University, questioned whether birth complications are a
valid indicator of infant pain and whether babies can remember the
experience, let alone recreate it in adulthood.
	   ``Any link between obstetric care and violent suicide is more
likely to occur through mental illness,'' Appleby wrote in an
editorial in the journal. ``However, even an indirect link between
... trauma and suicide may be important.''
	   Jacobson studied the birth records of 242 people _ 175 men and
67 women _ who were born between 1945 and 1980 and committed
suicide by shooting themselves or other violent means. He compared
their records with those of their 403 siblings born around the same
time.
	   A total of 44 of the men had a traumatic birth, compared with 26
in the sibling group.
	   Jacobson also found that the mothers of those who committed
violent suicides were given fewer painkillers. He theorizes this
may be because the baby absorbs the drugs through the placenta and
feels less pain during birth.
	   The researchers found no link with violent suicide for girls. In
an earlier preliminary study, they found no relationship between
difficult births and nonviolent forms of suicide, such as
poisoning.

	   Developments Thursday in the crisis with Iraq over U.N. weapons
inspections:
	   A second batch of U.N. employees left Iraq by bus. The 25
humanitarian workers join 233 U.N. inspectors and relief workers
who departed Iraq for Jordan and Bahrain a day earlier.
	   ___
	   Signaling changed attitudes across the Arab world, eight Arab
foreign ministers declared that Iraq would be ``held responsible
for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of U.N.
inspectors. The Clinton administration praises the statement.
	   ___
	   Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz accused President Clinton
of blocking the lifting of U.N. sanctions against his country.
``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally by
(Clinton's) government'' Aziz told reporters.
	   ___
	   The newspaper of Iraq's ruling Baath party condemned the
increasing possibility of a U.S. attack as American ``psychological
warfare.''
	   ___
	   The Israeli army opened gas mask distribution centers in
preparation for a possible attack by Iraq.
	   ___
	   The Clinton administration warned that Saddam had isolated
himself and must reverse course. ``We're not playing games,'' said
Defense Secretary William Cohen, speaking in Norfolk, Virginia,
aboard a Marine Corp. helicopter assault ship.
	   ___
	   Republican Sen. Richard Lugar, a senior voice on foreign policy
matters, urged the administration to follow up any airstrikes with
a full-fledged military campaign to remove Saddam from power. He
suggested the Iraqi leader ``might be killed.'' Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright said assassinating Saddam would not be a U.S.
goal.
	   ___
	   A senior Pentagon official said Iraqi installations likely to
harm the general population unduly are not being targeted. The
official specified power grids, bridges and other public utilities
as likely to be off-limits. Instead, planners are focusing
primarily on targets related to Iraq's suspected programs to
develop weapons of mass destruction.

<TEXT>
	   ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia (AP) _ A former U.S. security adviser,
wrapping up two days of talks in Ethiopia, has traveled to Eritrea
in a bid to settle the six-month border dispute.
	   Anthony Lake, sent to northeastern Africa by President Bill
Clinton, made no public remarks regarding his discussions Thursday
with Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi.
	   Lake also met with four Ethiopian religious leaders, recently
back from two days ago in Oslo, Norway, where they met with their
Eritrean counterparts under the auspices of Norwegian churches.
	   During his visit to Asmara, Lake planned to meet Eritrean
President Isaias Afwerki, senior officials and religious leaders.
	   Although fighting between the two nations has subsided, both
sides have steadily massed troops along their border.
	   Lake's mission coincides with an Organization of African Unity
effort to peacefully settle the dispute.
	   The OAU presented an 11-point peace proposal to the two sides in
Burkina Faso last weekend.
	   Ethiopia said Monday it accepted a key OAU proposal calling for
Eritrea to withdraw to positions it held before May 12, when
Ethiopian militia shot Eritrean soldiers they claimed had occupied
Ethiopian territory.
	   Eritrea refused, saying it wants an international monitoring
force in place before it will withdraw troops from the contested
Badme and Shiraro areas.
	   Eritrea fought a 30-year war against Ethiopia and was granted
independence in 1993 but the border between the two countries was
never officially declared.

French president in Mexico; trade high on agenda
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS previous to UPDATE with presidents signing accords,
Chirac's comments to business conference &QL; 
 &UR; By ADOLFO GARZA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ French President Jacques Chirac, starting a
visit to Mexico, promised that his country will support Mexico in
its bid to establish a free-trade agreement with the European
Community.
	   ``France will help you on the road that leads you to Europe,''
Chirac said Thursday in a speech to Mexico's Congress, where he
received enthusiastic applause.
	   Chirac, his wife Bernadette and a delegation of 50 officials and
businessmen began the first step of a trip that will also take him
to the hurricane-devastated countries of Central America.
	   The disaster of Hurricane Mitch, which killed nearly 10,000
people in Honduras and Nicaragua, almost overshadowed the long-term
issues of Franco-Mexican relations.
	   ``I want to express the profound emotion that France feels at
the tragedy inflicted by Hurricane Mitch on Mexico's neighbor
countries,'' Chirac said at the welcoming ceremony at Mexico City's
military parade ground, the Campo Marte.
	   Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo in turn said Mexico was
``moved by France's decision to come to the help of our Central
American brothers'' with aid and relief of debts for those
countries.
	   The two presidents signed agreements on trade, education, the
environment and energy, and attended the closing ceremony of the
French-Mexican Economic Forum, a business conference called to
strengthen bilateral trade.
	   ``In the era of globalization, it is vital to increase trade. It
is one of the foundations of growth and prosperity,'' Chirac told
the conference participants.
	   ``To this end, we are making progress in the agreement being
negotiated between Mexico and the European Union.''
	   Technical negotiations on a treaty began this week in Mexico
City and are expected to continue intermittently until at least
mid-1999 here and in Brussels.
	   ``France wants to be your privileged interlocutor within the
European Union,'' Chirac said at the welcoming ceremony, adding
that it would push to complete the free trade pact.
	   The proposed trade agreement would be a first for the European
Union in the Americas and might offer European countries a stronger
position in the United States and Canada, Mexico's partners in the
North American Free Trade Agreement.
	   Mexico itself is the world's 15th-largest economy, with about
100 million consumers.
	   For Mexico, relations with Europe help it balance the heavy
influence of its big northern neighbor. The United States accounts
for 85 percent of Mexican exports.
	   The 15-nation European Union as a bloc is Mexico's
second-largest trading partner, but two-way commerce accounted for
only 6.4 percent of Mexican trade during the first six months of
the year, down from 14.5 percent 10 years ago.
	   Mexico's trade with France totaled almost dlrs 1.5 billion last
year, with Mexican imports far outpacing exports. Trade in the
first half of 1998 showed an increased pace, reaching dlrs 928
million.
	   Among European countries, France ranks fourth in trade with
Mexico and fifth in investment here.

Jamaican leader urges Clinton to ease opposition in banana battle
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LLOYD WILLIAMS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KINGSTON, Jamaica (AP) _ Jamaica's prime minister on Thursday
joined other leaders in the region in urging President Clinton to
ease his opposition to European trade perks given to banana
producers.
	   Prime minister P.J. Patterson sent a letter to U.S. ambassador
Stanley McLelland calling the dispute a ``life and death'' matter
for small Caribbean countries.
	   The United States and Central American banana producers won a
World Trade Organization case in 1997 claiming that trade
preferences granted to former European colonies by the European
Union violate free-trade agreements.
	   The European Union rewrote its banana import agreements, but the
United States has been unsatisfied with the changes. On Nov. 6,
U.S. trade representatives threatened economic sanctions.
	   ``The (Caribbean) governments find it incomprehensible that,
despite our repeated urgings, the United States appears determined
to pursue a course of trade confrontation,'' Patterson wrote.
	   The prime ministers of Dominica, St. Vincent and the Grenadines,
St. Lucia, Grenada and Belize have sent similar letters to the
Clinton administration.
	   European Commission President Jacques Santer also spoke out
against the threats on Wednesday.
	   Patterson noted the clash comes as the United States is seeking
more international cooperation in the region, especially in
anti-drug efforts and so-called ``open skies'' aviation agreements.
	   ``We do not expect our friends to constantly threaten our vital
interests,'' Patterson said.
	   Banana sales to Britain and the European Union are Jamaica's
second largest farm export, with a value of some dlrs 45 million in
1997.

Former finance official spared jail term in bribery trial
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By YURI KAGEYAMA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A former Finance Ministry official accused of
accepting fancy dinners and golf outings as bribes from financial
institutions was spared imprisonment Friday after receiving a
three-year suspended sentence.
	   Takashi Sakakibara, 39, was convicted of accepting bribes worth
some 3.4 million yen (dlrs 28,000) in dinners and golf outings from
1993 to 1997 from Nomura Securities Co., Nikko Securities Co.,
Daiwa Securities. Co., the now-defunct Yamaichi Securities Co., and
Sumitomo Bank.
	   In return, Sakakibara helped persuade the ministry to let the
brokerages offer new financial products and tipped off Sumitomo
about revisions in Japan's bank law, prosecutors say.
	   They had demanded a three-year jail term for Sakakibara. But the
Tokyo District Court handed down a two-year jail term suspended for
three years and a fine of 3.4 million yen (dlrs 28,000), a court
official said.
	   The sentence means that as long as Sakikibara stays out of
further trouble for the next three years he won't have to spend any
time in prison.
	   The allegations against Sakakibara _ the first senior
career-track bureaucrat to be arrested since the end of World War
II _ shook public faith in the almighty Finance Ministry.
	   Sakakibara and three other former Finance Ministry officials
were arrested earlier this year in a ground-breaking investigation
that cracked down on the lavish entertainment often used in
Japanese business dealings.
	   The other officials have already received suspended sentences.
	   The ministry fired Sakakibara in July. He is no relation to
Eisuke Sakakibara, Japan's vice finance minister for international
affairs, known as ``Mr. Yen'' for his influence in global currency
markets.
	   The ministry has punished more than 100 officials for receiving
gifts and entertainment from financial institutions.
	   But there have been no further arrests, drawing concerns from
some that the investigation had been ended prematurely, possibly
because of political pressure.
	   Japan is trying to drag itself out of a recession, and speedy
action from the elite financial bureaucrats is seen as crucial to
bringing about a turnaround.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A policeman was killed in fighting
between riot officers and students who were marching on Parliament
to protest a government assembly, a newspaper reported Friday.
	   It was the first reported death from violence Thursday, in which
at least 110 students were badly injured, many with plastic bullet
wounds.
	   Protesters beat the officer to death at a toll road near
Parliament, The Jakarta Post quoted Col. Arthur Damanik, head of
the Jakarta police rapid response team, as saying.
	   The streets of the capital were quiet Friday.
	   The fighting was the worst outbreak of unrest in the capital
since riots forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to quit in
May after 32 years in power.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new political
system for the world's fourth most-populous nation.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year. Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers
intent on preserving their political privileges.

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Love her or loathe her, she is
impossible to ignore.
	   From taking on the tobacco industry to importing Cuban doctors,
Dr. Nkosazana Zuma, South Africa's first black Minister of Health,
is at the center of most government controversies.
	   On Thursday she notched her latest victory when the upper house
of Parliament gave final approval to one of the world's toughest
anti-smoking laws, which bans lighting up in public places and all
tobacco advertising. It awaits President Nelson Mandela's approval.
	   In some ways she typifies the leadership of the governing
African National Congress as it gears up for national elections
next year, which it likely will sweep.
	   Transformed from liberation fighter to government minister, Zuma
and her colleagues still display sometimes defensive mentality that
marked the struggle for survival under the onslaught of apartheid.
	   Zuma summed up her own attitude during a parliamentary debate
earlier this year when she lambasted opposition lawmakers for
demonizing her and insisted she would not ``somehow disappear.''
	   ``Forget about the person and look at the issues,'' she snapped.
	   Zuma accuses her detractors of defending elitism and past
privileges. The battlefields of the fight against white rule may
have shifted to the corridors of power, but the language is the
same.
	   ``If you protest her policies, she calls you a racist, or says
you oppose transformation,'' said David Morrell of the South
African Medical Association ``Every change she makes seems to carry
some threat.''
	   To critics she is the ``nanny of the nation,'' an interfering,
power-hungry busybody who wants to ban smoking in public and whose
mistake prone department squanders millions of rand (dollars).
	   Recent criticism came from researchers who attacked her decision
to end funding for expensive AZT treatments for HIV-positive
pregnant women to reduce the risk of passing on the virus to their
children. Zuma said the money was better spent on prevention.
	   While often sympathizing with Zuma's aims, doctors agree she
appears dictatorial and refuses to listen to the other side.
	   ``Her ideals are wonderful,'' said Morrell. ``But relations are
very strained. She seems to regard doctors as adversaries.''
	   Some of the abuse is vulgar. An edition of sex magazine Hustler
had its sales restricted after printing a picture of Zuma's face
and urging readers to urinate on it. The article was protesting
anti-tobacco legislation.
	   But for her defenders, Zuma is the champion of the poor who
overhauled a racist health system and brought basic health care to
millions of blacks ignored during apartheid.
	   Given her fondness for simple clothes and unadorned hair styles,
Zuma, 49, seems an unlikely revolutionary. But change has come
quickly in her four years at the helm since all-race elections in
1994 ended apartheid.
	   Within months of taking office, she made primary health care
free for pregnant women and children under six. By 1996 it was free
for all South Africans.
	   Shifting resources from wealthy hospitals mainly serving whites,
Zuma launched a campaign to build clinics in poor rural areas. By
the end of 1997 more than 350 had been built, compared to 17 in the
last year of white rule.
	   ``We have brought health care into parts of the country that
never had it before,'' said Zuma's spokesman Vincent Hlongwane.
	   Born in KwaZulu-Natal, Zuma was the oldest child in a family of
eight headed by a primary school teacher. She won a place at
medical school, but left the country to join the ANC in exile and
finished her degree in Britain.
	   From the start Zuma hit the headlines after sponsoring an AIDS
awareness musical that cost one-fifth of the government's AIDS
budget and was shut down due to mishandling the tender for the
lavish production.
	   Other scandals followed, including her backing of anti-AIDS drug
Virodene, which contains a potentially cancerous industrial
solvent. But she has hung with the full backing of Mandela, and
likely will stay on in the job after the elections.

Security Council extends U.N. observer mission in Tajikistan
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ The U.N. Security Council voted
unanimously to keep military observers in Tajikistan for another
six months and called on the government and Islamic rebels to
undertake ``vigorous efforts'' to implement last year's peace plan.
	   Despite the peace accord, Tajikistan remains restive. There are
periodic clashes between the hard-line government and the mostly
Islamic opposition. Also, many warlords do not recognize the peace
deal and wage turf battles with one another.
	   The council on Thursday urged the government and rebels ``to
create conditions for the holding of elections at the earliest
possible time in 1999.''
	   Secretary-General Kofi Annan recommended the extension of the
70-member observer mission until May 15. The observers have been
monitoring the 1997 peace deal that ended five years of civil war
in the former Soviet republic.
	   But the United Nations suspended field operations after two
military officers and two civilians working for the mission were
fatally shot in the head on July 20.
	   In the resolution extending the mission, the 15-member council
strongly condemned the murders and urged the government of
Tajikistan to complete its investigation into the killings and
bring those responsible to justice.
	   The United Nations has said it will not resume full operations
in Tajikistan until the investigation is completed, a view
reiterated by the council. ``Completion of the investigation into
this case is important for the resumption of field activities'' of
the observer mission, it said.
	   The United Nations withdrew all non-essential workers from
Tajikistan after the employees were ambushed while on patrol in the
mountains about 90 miles (140 kilometers) east of the capital
Dushanbe.
	   The Tajik Interior Ministry has said three people, members of an
armed opposition group, have confessed to the killings.
	   The Security Council also strongly condemned recent fighting
``initiated by forces trying to hinder the peace process in
Tajikistan'' and called for a halt to the violence.
	   Rebel forces launched attacks in northern Tajikistan in the most
serious outburst of violence since the peace accord was signed. But
after several days of heavy fighting, government troops forced the
rebels to flee into the mountains earlier this week.
	   According to the government, more than 200 people were killed
and hundreds more were wounded in and around the northern city of
Khudzhand.

U.S., Japan suggest new tactics to heal world economy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARTIN CRUTSINGER &QC; 
 &UR; AP Economics Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States and Japan have
suggested new tactics to fight the world financial crisis as they
prepare for talks next week by President Clinton and the leaders of
19 other Pacific Rim countries.
	   Overshadowing the efforts, though, is the fact that some of the
countries have sharp differences on such basic questions as whether
free-market trade is good.
	   Japan unveiled a proposed 18 trillion yen (dlrs 148 billion)
economic stimulus package _ its biggest yet _ hoping to answer
international criticism that it has done too little to help its
troubled Asian neighbors.
	   And U.S. officials worked behind the scenes Thursday to line up
support for proposals to provide help to debt-ridden banks and
companies. The United States also wants a bigger social safety net
for millions of people pushed back into poverty by the 17-month
crisis.
	   The activity is aimed at producing concrete results for Clinton
and other leaders to trumpet at the sixth annual Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   But it's unlikely the countries will be able to paper over their
huge differences over the best way to deal with what Clinton calls
the worst world economic crisis in a half-century.
	   Malaysia's government made clear Thursday that its prime
minister will use his prerogative as APEC meeting chairman to push
views directly opposed to the free-market approach championed by
the United States and the International Monetary Fund.
	   ``Our prime minister has often lamented the free flow of capital
and this so-called unbridled movement causing havoc to many
markets,'' said Abdul Razak, the Malaysian official chairing
agenda-setting talks among senior officials.
	   So deep are the divisions that the Clinton administration has
debated whether the president should stay away to express
disapproval of Prime Minister Mahathir Mohammad's economic views as
well as his firing and jailing of his finance minister, Anwar
Ibrahim.
	   This is the second APEC summit overshadowed by the Asian crisis,
which erupted in Thailand in 1997, and has since pushed several
Asian countries and Russia into steep nosedives. It also now
threatens Latin American nations.
	   Meanwhile, the trade and finance officials meeting in Malaysia
spent Thursday haggling over details of a trade liberalization
measure to eliminate tariffs in nine areas from chemicals to
medical products, which together make up dlrs 1.5 trillion in
global trade.
	   Japan insists that wood and fish products, two politically
sensitive areas for rural Japanese, not be included in the package.
	   Other countries object, arguing the whole deal will fall apart
if nations begin trying to opt out in their most sensitive areas.
	   ``That would be a disastrous course,'' Australian Trade Minister
Tim Fischer said.
	   In Washington, Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling said, ``It
has been a disappointment to us that at this stage Japan has not
made more progress and in fact has been resistant in the areas of
fish and forestry.'' He said it was important for Japan to meet its
commitments ``to discourage other countries from making excessive
reservations.''
	   In September, Mahathir, who has blamed foreign currency traders
for his country's economic problems, made it illegal to buy and
sell ringgits, the Malaysian currency, outside of the country.
	   He also imposed stiff controls on the withdrawal of foreign
capital, an attempt to stop panicked investors from leaving.
	   U.S. officials argue there is no alternative to the IMF formula
of austerity measures to fix flawed economies and restore investor
confidence.
	   At the same time, they have begun to stress the need to be
sensitive to the people and bankrupt companies harmed by economic
downturns. Already, 40 percent of the world is estimated to be in
recession.
	   The United States fears that unless some way is found to help
the victims of free-market turmoil, their suffering will trigger
growing social unrest and embolden other countries to follow
Malaysia's lead and close their economies to U.S. corporations
seeking investment opportunities.
	   The United States wants to tap dlrs 30 billion that Japan is
offering as aid to its Asian neighbors to pay for its debt
restructuring proposals. That has prompted Japanese officials to
complain that the United States wants to put up the ideas and have
Japan put up the money.
	   An American official insisted the United States is already
bearing its share of the effort through the soaring U.S. trade
deficit, which occurs because of rising imports from Asian nations
and reduced Asian demand for American products.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

Hotel sues relatives of guests who carried out suicide pact
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A suburban Tokyo hotel has sued the relatives and
companies of three guests who jointly committed suicide in their
rooms earlier this year, a court spokesman said Friday.
	   The hotel filed suit Thursday to recoup revenue losses allegedly
stemming from negative publicity surrounding the men's deaths, said
a Tokyo District Court spokesman, who declined to be named.
	   The three friends _ all executives of small, troubled auto parts
companies _ hanged themselves in February with ropes tied to
ceiling ventilation screens in their hotel rooms.
	   Le Piano hotel is seeking total damage payments of about 79
million yen (dlrs 643,794), the Asahi newspaper reported.
	   Hotel officials refused to comment.
	   The suicide pact attracted widespread media coverage as it
highlighted the plight of managers at small and medium-sized
companies squeezed by Japan's worst recession since the end of
World War II.

Nagano Olympic Committee to donate 90 percent of surplus
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The Nagano Olympic Committee will donate 90 percent
of its 4.5 billion yen (dlrs 36.87 million) profit from February's
Winter games to the Nagano prefectural (state) government, an
organizing official said Friday.
	   Jin-o Matsuo, spokesman for the Nagano Olympic Committee, said
the remaining 10 percent, or 450 million yen (dlrs 3.68 million),
will be donated to the Japanese Olympic Committee.
	   All the donated money will be used to help athletes aspiring to
participate in future Olympics and also to promote mostly winter
sports in Japan, Matsuo said.
	   Higher-than-expected ticket and Olympic merchandise sales,
coupled with the weak yen, largely contributed to the posting of
the surplus in the games, held in Nagano, 179 kilometers (112
miles), northwest of Tokyo, officials have said.
	   The total operating costs for the Nagano Winter games amounted
to 113.9 billion yen (dlrs 932.8 million), they said.

	   MARTIN BROD, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ Oblivious to the chilling
wind, Bogdan Medic stands near a destroyed bridge, looking
longingly at land on the other side of the Una River, where his
family owned a farm for decades.
	   Now, it's in a foreign country.
	   ``We are hungry, and we will have to go to the other side and
sow our land, despite threats by the Croatian police,'' said Medic,
61.
	   During the chaos of the Balkan wars, neighboring Croatia moved
parts of its border several kilometers (miles) into Bosnian
territory _ taking more than half of the small, predominantly
Bosnian Serb town of Martin Brod, 220 kilometers (150 miles) west
of Sarajevo. The move gave Croatia access to an important regional
rail line.
	   Many Martin Brod residents fled in the summer of 1995 as the
Croatian army offensive against rebel Serbs spilled over the
border. The army overran the town and advanced deep into Bosnian
territory. When residents returned in 1997, Croatian border police
were occupying the left bank of the river.
	   ``When we came back a year ago, Croatian police were standing on
the other side of the river, in the center of the town. They
stopped us, saying `This is Croatia now,' '' said 61-year-old
Emerik Plesnar, a retired railroad dispatcher.
	   Zeljko Trkanjec, Croatia's foreign ministry spokesman,
acknowledged the border situation is ``unresolved'' and expressed
his country's willingness to discuss it with Bosnia.
	   While Croatian officials say the shifted border corresponds to
the old boundary line between the then-republics, Bosnian officials
contend maps of former Yugoslavia show no such thing.
	   Pointing at a white house just across the river, Plesnar said he
lived there for more than 20 years. Today, he lives about 50 meters
(yards) away, as a refugee in a home vacated by a Serb.
	   Only one of three bridges still span the river. But Croatian
police prevent Martin Brod residents from using it, saying it isn't
an official border crossing. So instead of just crossing the
bridge, residents have to drive 90 kilometers (56 miles) to the
closest border crossing to visit their property.
	   Croatian police don't allow Bosnian Serbs to work their farms
across the river, so most Martin Brod residents rely on scarce
humanitarian aid and meager pensions to survive.
	   Croatians and Bosnians also disagree over another stretch of
border near the village of Zeljava in western Bosnia. Both former
Yugoslav republics claim the abandoned, mostly underground military
airport _ one of the biggest such facilities in Europe.
	   In addition, Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Muslims are at
loggerheads over the border that divides Bosnia into two substates
_ the Serb Republic and the Muslim-Croat federation.
	   Leaders from all three ethnic groups formed a border commission
in April 1997 to deal with such cases, but so far nothing has been
resolved.
	   Alexandra Stiglmayer, a spokeswoman for Bosnia's top
international mediator, Carlos Westendorp, said her office is
concerned with cases like the Martin Brod dispute. International
officials hope the border commission will deal with such problems
``as a matter of urgency,'' Stiglmayer said.
	   But international officials will not press Croatia until its
leaders sign several political and economic agreements being
negotiated with Bosnia.
	   Until then, Martin Brod and its people remain divided between
two countries.
	   One returnee tried to bridge the gap another way.
	   Pero Rodic, 57, said he went to Zagreb, Croatia's capital, to
request citizenship, hoping this would allow him to return to his
property. Officials there said computer records don't show Martin
Brod as part of Croatia. Yet border police claim it is.
	   ``Somebody will have to give up,'' Rodic says. ``It won't be
us.''

Dollar lower against yen, Japanese stocks rise in morning trading
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with midday stock, late morning bond and currency
prices &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar declined against the yen Friday
morning on local news reports that Japan plans to unveil a
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package. Tokyo stock prices
moved higher.
	   The dollar bought 122.71 yen at midday, down 0.51 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 121.98
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 77.15 points,
or 0.55 percent, to finish the morning session at 13,997.91. On
Thursday, the average closed down 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar's downward move came
after the currency rose as high as 124.08 yen in New York on
Thursday _ its highest level since Oct. 7 _ as investors sought
safer assets while U.S. military forces moved closer to Iraq.
	   But the greenback shed some of its early gains later, with the
yen strengthening on a report Japan is readying a stimulus package
even bigger than Thursday's 18 trillion yen (dlrs 147 billion) tax
cut and spending proposal, traders said.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper said Friday that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's package, to be officially announced Monday,
could top 20 trillion yen (dlrs 182 billion).
	   Traders said, however, that the dollar's drop may be short-lived
due to continued speculation the United States may strike Iraq over
its rejection of U.N. nuclear weapons inspections.
	   ``We don't really want to go too short on dollars given the Iraq
issue,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank
Ltd. ``But I think dollar buying by Japanese commercial players may
have run its course for the day.''
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market retreated from early
gains in thin trading as investors awaited the outcome of an
attempt Monday by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to woo the
minority Liberal Party into a coalition government.
	   The Liberal Party has said any such alliance must be accompanied
by the temporary suspension of a nationwide sales tax.
	   ``Dealers are keeping their positions light as they await the
results of the LDP and Liberal Party meeting,'' said Setsuo Nagao,
a manager in the equity division at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   ``A cut in the sales tax, even if only temporary, will have a
big impact on spending,'' he said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section lost 4.62 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,078.31. The TOPIX
closed down 15.19 points, or 1.38 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from late Thursday at 0.820 percent. Its price
fell to 108.70 yen, down from 108.71 yen the previous day.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ Re-energized by the United
States' signing of the Kyoto global-warming accord, talks on how to
implement the treaty's key provisions for cutting pollutants are
entering their final phase.
	   The two-week Buenos Aires summit, the biggest since the historic
Kyoto treaty was reached, was expected to conclude Friday.
	   Delegates hoped to agree on a framework for carrying out the
accord, which calls for reductions in heat-trapping gases by
industrialized nations by 2012.
	   The United States _ the world's largest polluter _ was the last
of the major industrial nations to sign the agreement reached last
December in Kyoto, Japan.
	   The signing at U.N. headquarters in New York was largely
symbolic since it still needs to be ratified by the U.S. Congress,
where it faces firm opposition.
	   Critics said U.S. intentions, conveyed at the environmental
summit by Undersecretary of State Stuart Eizenstat, appeared short
on concrete action.
	   Eizenstat told representatives of more than 160 countries in
Buenos Aires that Washington was promoting new energy-efficiency
standards for appliances, and cleaner technologies for industry,
but gave few other specifics on how the United States would cut
emissions.
	   Developing nations, which are not legally bound to emissions
targets under the treaty but are under pressure to participate, say
the United States isn't taking climate change seriously enough.
	   The developing nations say emission controls place a greater
burden on their economies than on the United States' and they
generally oppose controls.
	   On Wednesday, Argentina became the first major developing nation
to promise voluntary action to curb greenhouse gases, a move seen
as a breakthrough by U.S. officials. The former Soviet republic of
Kazakstan followed suit on Thursday.
	   But China and India, two of the biggest contributors of
greenhouse gas pollution, have steadfastly refused to participate.
	   Remaining issues in the waning hours of the Buenos Aires meeting
included a U.S. call to allow industrial nations to ``trade''
emissions targets to cut costs. Opponents say such a mechanism
would let Washington avoid its pollution-cutting obligations.
	   Many scientists believe that Earth is gradually warming because
of emissions. But critics of the theory in the United States say
global warming scenarios have not been proven, and that the cost of
cutting greenhouses gases threatens U.S. industry.

U.S., Japan suggest new tactics to heal world economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The United States and Japan have
suggested new tactics to fight the world financial crisis as they
prepare for talks next week by U.S. President Bill Clinton and the
leaders of 19 other Pacific Rim countries.
	   Overshadowing the efforts, though, is the fact that some of the
countries have sharp differences on such basic questions as whether
free-market trade is good.
	   Japan unveiled a proposed 18 trillion yen (dlrs 148 billion)
economic stimulus package _ its biggest yet _ hoping to answer
international criticism that it has done too little to help its
troubled Asian neighbors.
	   And U.S. officials worked behind the scenes to line up support
for proposals to provide help to debt-ridden banks and companies.
The United States also wants a bigger social safety net for
millions of people pushed back into poverty by the 17-month-old
Asian financial crisis.
	   The activity is aimed at producing concrete results for Clinton
and other leaders to trumpet at the sixth annual Asia Pacific
Economic Cooperation summit Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   But it's unlikely the countries will be able to paper over their
huge differences over the best way to deal with what Clinton calls
the worst world economic crisis in a half-century.
	   Malaysian government officials made it clear that Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohammad will use his prerogative as meeting chairman to
push views directly opposed to the free-market approach championed
by the United States and the International Monetary Fund.
	   In a speech Friday to an APEC trade fair, Mahathir called the
steps he has taken to insulate his economy from the global turmoil
the right approach to put Malaysia ``quickly on the path of
recovery.''
	   He attacked international credit rating agencies, who have
downgraded Malaysia's credit rating as ``negative and biased'' and
forecast that his economy, now in a deep recession, will resume
growth by next year.
	   So deep are the divisions that the Clinton administration has
debated whether the president should stay away to express
disapproval of Mahathir's economic views as well as his firing and
jailing of his finance minister, Anwar Ibrahim.
	   This is the second APEC summit overshadowed by the Asian crisis,
which erupted in Thailand in 1997 and has since pushed several
Asian countries and Russia into steep nosedives. It also now
threatens Latin American nations.
	   Meanwhile, the trade and finance officials meeting in Malaysia
spent Thursday haggling over details of a trade liberalization
measure to eliminate tariffs in nine areas from chemicals to
medical products, which together make up dlrs 1.5 trillion in
global trade.
	   Japan insists that wood and fish products, two politically
sensitive areas for rural Japanese, not be included in the package.
	   Other countries object, arguing the whole deal will fall apart
if nations begin trying to opt out in their most sensitive areas.
	   ``That would be a disastrous course,'' Australian Trade Minister
Tim Fischer said Thursday.
	   In Washington, Clinton economic adviser Gene Sperling said, ``It
has been a disappointment to us that at this stage Japan has not
made more progress and in fact has been resistant in the areas of
fish and forestry.'' He said it was important for Japan to meet its
commitments ``to discourage other countries from making excessive
reservations.''
	   In September, Mahathir, who has blamed foreign currency traders
for his country's economic problems, made it illegal to buy and
sell ringgits, the Malaysian currency, outside of the country.
	   He also imposed stiff controls on the withdrawal of foreign
capital, an attempt to stop panicked investors from leaving.
	   U.S. officials argue there is no alternative to the IMF formula
of austerity measures to fix flawed economies and restore investor
confidence.
	   At the same time, they have begun to stress the need to be
sensitive to the people and bankrupt companies harmed by economic
downturns. Already, 40 percent of the world is estimated to be in
recession.
	   The United States fears that unless some way is found to help
the victims of free market turmoil, their suffering will trigger
growing social unrest and embolden other countries to follow
Malaysia's lead and close their economies to U.S. corporations
seeking investment opportunities.
	   The United States wants to tap dlrs 30 billion that Japan is
offering as aid to its Asian neighbors to pay for its debt
restructuring proposals. That has prompted Japanese officials to
complain that the United States wants to put up the ideas and have
Japan put up the money.
	   An American official insisted the United States is already
bearing its share of the effort through the soaring U.S. trade
deficit, which occurs because of rising imports from Asian nations
and reduced Asian demand for American products.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join APEC at this summit.

Indonesian military chief calls on people to stay at home amid
</HEADLINE>
protests
 &UR; By GEOFF SPENCER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Indonesia's armed forces chief urged
people to stay at home Friday as the military and students ready
for another day of protests while a special government assembly put
the final touches to a new political blueprint for Indonesia.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto warned that his forces would
take stern action to quell unrest against the students, who vowed
to take to the streets again.
	   ``It is wise for businesses not to open,'' he told
privately-owned Radio Trijaya. ``Don't go out unless it is
necessary.''
	   The capital, Jakarta, was quiet Friday morning in contrast to
pitched street battles with demonstrators on Thursday night when
police and troops opened fire with tear gas, rubber bullets and
water cannons.
	   The fighting, left one police officer dead and more than 100
students hospitalized, many with serious plastic bullet wounds.
	   It was the worst outbreak of unrest in Jakarta since riots
forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to quit in May after 32
years in power.
	   The students oppose a special government assembly convened by
his successor, President B.J. Habibie, to map out a new political
system for the world's fourth most-populous nation.
	   Habibie, a former protege of Suharto, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   Critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers intent
on preserving their political privileges.
	   The assembly is expected on Friday to announce a date for the
elections and to support new laws to legalize many political
parties.
	   The students demand greater democratic change including an end
of military involvement in politics. They also want Suharto put on
trial for corruption and human rights abuses.
	   Student leaders said bigger protests would be staged on Friday.
Hundreds of students were seen gathering at several Jakarta college
campuses in the morning. However, there was no immediate sign of
trouble.
	   Wiranto warned that 30,000 police and troops deployed across the
capital would take ``sterner and firmer action'' if student
protests get out of control.
	   A policeman was killed in Thursday night's unrest, newspapers
and the military said.
	   The Jakarta Post reported quoted an officer as saying protesters
beat the policeman to death at a toll road near Parliament.
	   However, the newspaper Kompas reported that the officer died
from injuries sustained when he fell from the back of a police
truck he had been riding.
	   The military's main spokesman Brig. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif also
said the man fell from a truck.

Estrada to discuss Chinese `encroachment' with Jiang
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday he will discuss Chinese ``encroachment'' in areas in
the South China Sea being claimed by his country during his meeting
next week with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Manila protested to Beijing last week after the Philippine
military discovered China was expanding structures it had built in
1995 on the disputed Mischief Reef in the Spratlys.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado described China's action as
``creeping invasion'' and accused Beijing of bullying the
Philippines because it has a weak military.
	   ``I will take this up with him and we will say that this area is
within our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,'' Estrada said in a
radio interview. ``We will explain to him that they are encroaching
and entering our territory.''
	   Oscar Valenzuela, spokesman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs, said Estrada and Jiang are scheduled to hold bilateral
talks on Nov. 17 on the first day of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia.
	   ``The agenda has been firmed up and one of the things to be
discussed is these developments at the Mischief Reef,'' Valenzuela
said without elaborating.
	   The Philippines says China violated a 1995 agreement, reached
after the first dispute over the Mischief Reef, not to increase
activities in the area for confidence building on both sides.
	   Earlier this week, armed forces chief of staff Maj. Gen. Joselin
Nazareno ordered military planes not to fly lower than 5,000 feet
(1,515 meters) over the reef after China warned that low-flying
reconnaissance flights by Philippine jets might trigger an
accidental confrontation.
	   China has said the structures at the reef were shelters for
Chinese fishermen. It said it was repairing the shelters and that
it has a sovereign right to undertake the repairs to ensure the
safety of its fishermen.
	   Mercado, however, said China was building massive barracks and
possibly a pier that could be used militarily.
	   Estrada and other administration officials have said the
conflict over the reef would be solved diplomatically and would not
lead to a military confrontation.
	   Mercado has shown pictures of large wooden barracks being built
on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a cluster of
concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile (three-by-six-kilometer)
reef.
	   The pictures also showed dozens of workers. Military officers
say the barracks could house about 70 people.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys, believed to be rich in minerals, is claimed in
whole or in part by the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei
and Malaysia.

<TEXT>
	   VILLANOVA, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Monica Seles and Natalie Tauziat,
seeded fifth and sixth, and unseeded Steffi Graf advanced to the
quarterfinals with victories Thursday in the Advanta Championships.
	   One seed fell, as No. 7 Patty Schnyder of Switzerland lost to
qualifier Amy Frazier 6-3, 6-1.
	   After easily winning the first set, Seles defeated Japan's Ai
Sugiyama 6-3, 7-5. Seles fell behind 4-1 in the second set but
rallied to 6-5. Seles used a cross-court return to win the first
point of the final game, then swung her powerful backhands to
secure three consecutive points.
	   Seles moves on to face doubles partner Natasha Zvereva of
Belgium in the next round. In the evening session, Seles and
Zvereva combined to beat top-seeded Lindsay Davenport and Corina
Moraiu 3-6, 7-5, 6-3 in doubles.
	   Graf beat Russia's Elena Likhovtseva 6-7 (5-7), 6-2, 6-4. Graf
dropped a first set that featured eight break points, then
dominated the second.
	   Likhovtseva cut a 5-2 deficit to 5-4 in the third set after
winning eight of nine points, but Graf closed with three service
points and clinched it on Likhovtseva's double fault.
	   With the victory and Seles' defeat of Sugiyama, Graf was ensured
the 16th and last spot in the Chase Championships singles field.
Sugiyama could have qualified by reaching the Advanta finals.
	   Tauziat improved her lifetime record against Lisa Raymond to 5-0
in a 6-2, 7-6 (7-4) victory.
	   Also in doubles, Raymond, from nearby Wayne, Pennsylvania and
Australian Rennae Stubbs defeated Lori McNeil and Kimberly Po 6-2,
6-1 to move to the semifinals.
	   The dlrs 450,000 Advanta tournament is the final event on the
WTA Tour before the Chase Championships.

	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ As the crisis over U.N. arms inspections
deepens, Iraq lashed out at Washington, accusing President Bill
Clinton of blocking the completion of arms inspections needed for
punishing trade sanctions on Iraq to be lifted
	   ``The road is being blocked continuously, stubbornly, illegally
by his government,'' Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz _ gesturing
defiantly, his voice rising in anger _ said Thursday at a news
conference that came shortly after a group of Arab states said Iraq
itself would be at fault if the U.S. military struck at the
country.
	   The criticism by the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation
Council _ Iraq's vulnerable neighbors _ along with Syria and Egypt
was unusually strong for Arab countries who have repeatedly called
for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
	   Foreign ministers of the eight states, meeting in the Gulf state
of Qatar, did urge ``wisdom and reason'' to end the confrontation.
But they said the government of Saddam Hussein would be
``responsible for any consequences'' from its stopping the work of
U.N. weapons inspectors.
	   Aziz gave little heed to the plea from the Arabs.
	   ``If they are sincere in dealing with this situation ... they
should blame the main block, the main government which is behind
this crisis. They should criticize the United States,'' he said.
	   In nearby Israel, the government opened gas mask distribution
centers for its citizens even as officials said they believed the
possibility of an Iraqi retaliatory attack on Israel, like those
during the Gulf War, was slim.
	   Iraq's defiant stand came despite growing evidence that the
United States was preparing to make good on its military threats
unless searches for Iraq's weapons of mass destruction are renewed.
	   ``We're not playing games,'' U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen said. But he also said, ``We're not seeking to go to war.
We're seeking to avoid it. All he has to do is comply. The choice
is his.''
	   The United States on Wednesday ordered more warships headed to
the Gulf to prepare for an attack, and the United Nations _
declaring that it must look to the safety of its workers _ pulled
21 more staff members out of Iraq on Thursday.
	   The U.N. pullback began Wednesday. All arms inspectors and
one-third of the 450 humanitarian workers have left the country,
with the departure of aid workers likely reducing the effectiveness
of programs to help Iraq's 22 million people.
	   Aziz said Iraq was willing to cooperate with arms inspectors,
but only if it had guarantees from the U.N. Security Council that
it would lead to lifting sanctions imposed after Iraq's 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
	   He accused the Clinton administration of undermining a U.N.
offer of a comprehensive review of the arms inspections _ as one
step toward lifting the sanctions _ by refusing to include even a
reference to the eight-year-old trade embargo.
	   Deputy U.S. Ambassador Peter Burleigh said the dispute was not
being pushed by the United States.
	   ``This is the international community and the United Nations as
a whole versus Iraq,'' he said. ``If the Iraqi authorities don't
understand that, they've missed a very important dimension of
what's going on here.''
	   The sanctions, which limit Iraqi oil sales and have ruined its
economy, cannot be lifted until the inspectors certify that Iraq
has destroyed its lethal weapons. This was required under the
cease-fire resolutions that ended the 1991 Gulf War.
	   Aziz complained that after more than seven years of working with
U.N. inspectors, sanctions were not reduced or lifted. Iraq's
people were not worried about a possible strike, he said.
	   ``They are dying whether in a hospital which lacks medicine and
equipment or they die by American bombs,'' he said. ``For the Iraqi
people it makes no difference.''
	   Aziz said that U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan was ``the best
person'' to try to ease the current crisis, as he did the last one
in February with a pledge to work toward an end to the sanctions.
	   Annan cut short a trip through north Africa and returned to New
York on Thursday afternoon, saying he plans to meet with the
Security Council on Friday but has no plans to fly to Baghdad to
mediate.
	   Chief U.N. weapons inspector Richard Butler said Aziz's comments
were discouraging.
	   ``This is a very serious confrontation by Iraq of the Security
Council, and I don't see any diplomatic solution around as we speak
tonight,'' he told MSNBC on Thursday night. ``There's a growing
sense that airstrikes or enforcement is becoming more and more
likely.''

Estrada to discuss Chinese `encroachment' with Jiang

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday he will discuss Chinese ``encroachment'' in areas in
the South China Sea being claimed by his country during his meeting
next week with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Manila protested to Beijing last week after the Philippine
military discovered China was expanding structures it had built in
1995 on the disputed Mischief Reef in the Spratlys.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado described China's action as
``creeping invasion'' and accused Beijing of bullying the
Philippines because it has a weak military.
	   ``I will take this up with him and we will say that this area is
within our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,'' Estrada said in a
radio interview. ``We will explain to him that they are encroaching
and entering our territory.''
	   Oscar Valenzuela, spokesman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs, said Estrada and Jiang are scheduled to hold bilateral
talks on Nov. 17 on the first day of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia.
	   ``The agenda has been firmed up and one of the things to be
discussed is these developments at the Mischief Reef,'' Valenzuela
said without elaborating.
	   The Philippines says China violated a 1995 agreement, reached
after the first dispute over the Mischief Reef, not to increase
activities in the area for confidence building on both sides.
	   Earlier this week, armed forces chief of staff Maj. Gen. Joselin
Nazareno ordered military planes not to fly lower than 5,000 feet
(1,515 meters) over the reef after China warned that low-flying
reconnaissance flights by Philippine jets might trigger an
accidental confrontation.
	   China has said the structures at the reef were shelters for
Chinese fishermen. It said it was repairing the shelters and that
it has a sovereign right to undertake the repairs to ensure the
safety of its fishermen.
	   Mercado, however, said China was building massive barracks and
possibly a pier that could be used militarily.
	   Estrada and other administration officials have said the
conflict over the reef would be solved diplomatically and would not
lead to a military confrontation.
	   Mercado has shown pictures of large wooden barracks being built
on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a cluster of
concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile (three-by-six-kilometer)
reef.
	   The pictures also showed dozens of workers. Military officers
say the barracks could house about 70 people.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys, believed to be rich in minerals, is claimed in
whole or in part by the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei
and Malaysia.

	   BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) _ As the hurricane hunter plane
swooped low over the ocean on a late October day, white caps and
green foam flicked across the tropical waters, giving rise to
Mitch.
	   Clouds grew. Rain squalls massed. And Tropical Depression No. 13
would become a killing machine whose 180-mph (290-kph) winds made
it one of the century's strongest Atlantic hurricanes.
	   Reaching colossal heights, Mitch would blot out more than 10,000
lives across Central America with torrential rains, sending
mudslides tumbling over villages and floodwaters to the sea.
	   Powerful hurricanes like Mitch, devastating droughts and
torrential floods have long plagued humankind.
	   But a number of governments, scientists and environmentalists
meeting this week at a U.N. climate summit in the Argentine capital
warned there could be more extreme weather if nations don't
effectively cut greenhouse gas pollutants believed to cause Earth's
undue warming.
	   The two-week summit was expected to conclude Friday with a
framework for carrying out the 1997 Kyoto treaty, which calls for
reductions in heat-trapping gases by industrialized nations by
2012.
	   Skeptics insist there's no way to predict the weather, next
week, next decade or even a century from now. Environmentalists,
too, are wary of linking any specific weather event to overall
global warming.
	   In 1995, the U.N.-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change, where more than 2,000 scientists concluded in a landmark
report that ``the balance of evidence suggests a discernible human
influence on global climate.''
	   In other words, mankind has some hand in the Earth's warming.
	   Picking up their cue from the scientific evidence, climate
negotiators in Buenos Aires say there is more cause for concern.
	   ``Every month so far this year has set a record high for global
temperatures, right on the heels of 1997, the warmest year on the
books. And a powerful El Nino gave us a taste of the extreme
weather we can expect from global warming: droughts and floods in
Texas, drought-driven fires in Indonesia, Florida and Mexico, and
devastating floods in China,'' said Stuart Eizenstat, the top U.S.
climate negotiator.
	   Others reject that the globe is warming, and challenge the
consensus that unfettered burning of coal, gas and oil will harm
the Earth. As the debate continues, record amounts of gases spew
from power plants and cars.
	   New research shows that temperature changes can change more
rapidly than previously thought, says Jeff Severinghause of the
Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego.
	   ``We now have evidence that at the end of the last ice age, the
climate warmed abruptly in less than 10 years,'' he said, reporting
findings from 100-pound (45-kilo) samples extracted from
Greenland's ice pack.
	   He said evidence suggests a rapid change 11,600 years ago, when
temperatures rose about 14 degrees F (8 degrees C) in a mere decade
or two. He has documented at least one other sudden shift.
	   One U.S. atmospheric scientist, John R. Christy at the
University of Alabama, contends satellite and balloon data show
significant global warming is not occuring now. He has also argued
that trying to discern patterns in ``extreme'' weather events is
misleading.
	   And hurricane forecasters doubt extreme weather events such as
Mitch show the influence of global warming.
	   ``I think it's agreed that the globe is about 1 degree
Fahrenheit warmer this century, but as far as its effect on
tropical cyclones, we haven't been able to notice any difference,''
said forecaster Brian Jarvinen at the U.S. National Hurricane
Center in Miami.
	   He said intense hurricane periods have cycled on and off roughly
every 25 years in this century. ``You had intense storms in the
1920s, 30s and 40s,'' he said, but then a milder hurricane cycle
from the 60s to the 80s.
	   Some governments warn they can't wait for a definitive answer to
why the oceans are rising.
	   Seas have risen 2 centimeters (nearly 1 inch) in the past year
in parts of the Pacific, shrinking shorelines and displacing
coastal dwellers _ all blamed on global warming.
	   The prime minister of Tuvalu said his nation of 9,600 people _
spread over nine small South Pacific atolls, has already suffered.
	   ``We are the most vulnerable of the vulnerable countries,'' said
Bikenibeau Paeniu. ``We are spending millions of dollars to
rehabilitate the devastation caused by the adverse effects of
climate change.''
	   As for global warming, he added his islands average just 2
meters (6 feet) above sea level, and global warming is ``not a
matter of economics and politics, but of life and death.''

Malaysia calls on APEC to be sympathetic to weaker economies
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-APEC
 &UR; By RANJAN ROY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad on Friday called on the richer Pacific Rim nations to be
more considerate of those smaller Asian nations battered by the
economic crisis.
	   ``The weakened economies cannot be expected to shoulder the same
level of commitments to liberalize their markets as the stronger
ones,'' Mahathir said in a speech inaugurating a trade fair on the
sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation trade summit.
	   Cabinet ministers from the 20 member nations arrive this weekend
to prepare the agenda ahead of the summit between the heads of
state next Tuesday and Wednesday.
	   Senior officials remained stonewalled Friday on a massive trade
liberalization pact that represents some dlrs 1.5 trillion in trade
among the APEC nations.
	   Japan is balking at opening up its wood and fish industries, two
politically sensitive areas for rural Japanese. But the United
States is insisting that all APEC members agree to liberalize nine
key sectors, as they agreed to do during last year's summit in
Vancouver, Canada.
	   Mahathir said Friday that weaker APEC members should be allowed
to open up their markets based on their domestic capabilities and
level of economic development.
	   ``The weakened economies cannot be expected to shoulder the same
level of commitments to liberalize their markets as the stronger
one,'' he said. ``Unrestrained liberalization may eventually weaken
the economy further and yield results which are the opposite of
what is expected.''
	   The 72-year-old leader later canceled a press conference;
officials said he wasn't feeling well.
	   Mahathir has increasingly turned away from the free-market
system since his nation slid into its worst recession in a decade.
Malaysia has imposed strict currency controls, which have been
frowned on by the Western financial experts.
	   Mahathir on Friday also blasted international credit rating
agencies and the media for undermining economic recovery efforts
under way in crisis-hit Asian economies.
	   He urged international businessmen who have traveled to Kuala
Lumpur for a meeting to coincide with the APEC summit to evaluate
economies on their own and not depend on rating agencies or news
reports.
	   ``None of the rating agencies or the media predicted the current
economic turmoil,'' he said.
	   Mahathir's anger with rating agencies like Moody's and Standard
and Poor stems from repeated downgrades of Malaysian bonds in
recent months. The lower ratings came as Malaysia was struggling to
raise money overseas to recapitalize its banks buried under bad
debts.
	   Malaysia's economy is likely to shrink by nearly 5 percent this
year, but Mahathir remains optimistic of recovery and even a 1
percent growth next year.
	   APEC comprises Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, China, Hong
Kong, Indonesia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand,
Papua New Guinea, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan, Thailand and
the United States.
	   Russia, Peru and Vietnam will join at this summit.

	   TOKYO (AP) _ The U.S. dollar declined against the yen Friday
morning on local news reports that Japan plans to unveil a
larger-than-expected economic stimulus package. Tokyo stock prices
moved higher.
	   The dollar bought 122.71 yen at midday, down 0.51 yen from late
Thursday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 121.98
yen overnight.
	   The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average fell 77.15 points,
or 0.55 percent, to finish the morning session at 13,997.91. On
Thursday, the average closed down 352.96 points, or 2.45 percent.
	   On the foreign exchange market, the dollar's downward move came
after the currency rose as high as 124.08 yen in New York on
Thursday _ its highest level since Oct. 7 _ as investors sought
safer assets while U.S. military forces moved closer to Iraq.
	   But the greenback shed some of its early gains later, with the
yen strengthening on a report Japan is readying a stimulus package
even bigger than Thursday's 18 trillion yen (dlrs 147 billion) tax
cut and spending proposal, traders said.
	   The Nihon Keizai newspaper said Friday that the ruling Liberal
Democratic Party's package, to be officially announced Monday,
could top 20 trillion yen (dlrs 182 billion).
	   Traders said, however, that the dollar's drop may be short-lived
due to continued speculation the United States may strike Iraq over
its rejection of U.N. weapons inspections.
	   ``We don't really want to go too short on dollars given the Iraq
issue,'' said Yukihiko Hashimoto, a senior trader at Sanwa Bank
Ltd. ``But I think dollar buying by Japanese commercial players may
have run its course for the day.''
	   On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the market retreated from early
gains in thin trading as investors awaited the outcome of an
attempt Monday by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party to woo the
minority Liberal Party into a coalition government.
	   The Liberal Party has said any such alliance must be accompanied
by the temporary suspension of a nationwide sales tax.
	   ``Dealers are keeping their positions light as they await the
results of the LDP and Liberal Party meeting,'' said Setsuo Nagao,
a manager in the equity division at Tokyo Securities Co.
	   ``A cut in the sales tax, even if only temporary, will have a
big impact on spending,'' he said.
	   The Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the first
section lost 4.62 points, or 0.43 percent, to 1,078.31. The TOPIX
closed down 15.19 points, or 1.38 percent, the day before.
	   The yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese government
bond was unchanged from late Thursday at 0.820 percent. Its price
fell to 108.70 yen, down from 108.71 yen the previous day.

Prison cells for death sentence inmates overloaded
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HANOI, Vietnam (AP) _ A surge in inmates awaiting execution has
overcrowded a prison in central Vietnam, an official said Friday.
	   There are 22 death-row inmates at the Nghi Kim prison in Nghe
An, which has only 16 cells to hold them, the prison official said.
	   As a result, six are being held in other cells with reinforced
security until five more death-row cells can be finished by the end
of the month, he said.
	   Nineteen of the inmates were convicted on drug-trafficking
charges, while three were sentenced to death on robbery and murder
charges, he said.
	   Up to 10 more death sentences are expected to be issued by the
end of the year, he said.
	   So far this year, only one of the prison's inmates has been
executed, compared with four last year.
	   In Vietnam, execution is carried out by a firing squad after
pleas for clemency are rejected by the president.
	   Drug traffickers have targeted Nghe An, which borders Laos,
since police broke a heroin-trafficking syndicate in the northern
province of Lai Chau.
	   Seven of the 22 people convicted of involvement in the
syndicate, including police and border guard officers, were
executed earlier this year.

Estrada to discuss Chinese `encroachment' with Jiang
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: INSERTS new 7th-8th grafs with new Estrada quotes. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Philippine President Joseph Estrada
said Friday he will discuss Chinese ``encroachment'' in areas in
the South China Sea being claimed by his country during his meeting
next week with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
	   Manila protested to Beijing last week after the Philippine
military discovered China was expanding structures it had built in
1995 on the disputed Mischief Reef in the Spratlys.
	   Defense Secretary Orlando Mercado described China's action as
``creeping invasion'' and accused Beijing of bullying the
Philippines because it has a weak military.
	   ``I will take this up with him and we will say that this area is
within our 200-mile exclusive economic zone,'' Estrada said in a
radio interview. ``We will explain to him that they are encroaching
and entering our territory.''
	   Oscar Valenzuela, spokesman for the Department of Foreign
Affairs, said Estrada and Jiang are scheduled to hold bilateral
talks on Nov. 17 on the first day of a meeting of Asia-Pacific
leaders in Malaysia.
	   ``The agenda has been firmed up and one of the things to be
discussed is these developments at the Mischief Reef,'' Valenzuela
said without elaborating.
	   Estrada said he may also have an opportunity to talk with U.S.
President Bill Clinton to seek Washington's help ``to augment our
armed forces.''
	   ``We don't have enough military equipment and in our situation,
we may have to ask for help from the U.S.,'' he said.
	   The Philippines says China violated a 1995 agreement, reached
after the first dispute over the Mischief Reef, not to increase
activities in the area for confidence building on both sides.
	   Earlier this week, armed forces chief of staff Maj. Gen. Joselin
Nazareno ordered military planes not to fly lower than 5,000 feet
(1,515 meters) over the reef after China warned that low-flying
reconnaissance flights by Philippine jets might trigger an
accidental confrontation.
	   China has said the structures at the reef were shelters for
Chinese fishermen. It said it was repairing the shelters and that
it has a sovereign right to undertake the repairs to ensure the
safety of its fishermen.
	   Mercado, however, said China was building massive barracks and
possibly a pier that could be used militarily.
	   Estrada and other administration officials have said the
conflict over the reef would be solved diplomatically and would not
lead to a military confrontation.
	   Mercado has shown pictures of large wooden barracks being built
on stilts on a concrete foundation adjacent to a cluster of
concrete platforms on the two-by-four-mile (three-by-six-kilometer)
reef.
	   The pictures also showed dozens of workers. Military officers
say the barracks could house about 70 people.
	   Mischief Reef, called Panganiban by the Philippines, is about
150 miles (240 kilometers) west of the western Philippine island of
Palawan.
	   The Spratlys, believed to be rich in minerals, is claimed in
whole or in part by the Philippines, China, Taiwan, Vietnam, Brunei
and Malaysia.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ Dominik Hasek made 23 saves for his third
shutout of the season and the Buffalo Sabres extended their
unbeaten streak to seven games with a 2-0 victory over the
struggling Washington Capitals on Thursday night.
	   The Sabres are 4-0-3 in their last seven games, equaling the
current 5-0-2 streak by the Phoenix Coyotes for the NHL's longest
unbeaten string of the season.
	   Hasek, who has started and finished each of Buffalo's 13 games
this year, recorded his 36th career shutout.
	   Dixon Ward and Miroslav Satan scored for the Sabres, who are
2-0-2 in their last four road games.
 &UR; Islanders 4, Canadiens 0
	   In Uniondale, New York, Tommy Salo made 21 saves for his
league-leading fourth shutout and Mariusz Czerkawski scored his
first two goals this season as the Islanders beat the Montreal
Canadiens.
	   Barry Richter and Robert Reichel also scored for the Islanders,
who evened their record at 8-8-0 _ the sixth time this season New
York reached the .500 mark.
	   Salo, who faced few tough chances, has started all 16 games for
the Islanders. Half of his wins have been shutouts.
	   Jocelyn Thibault made his first start in five games for the
Canadiens and turned aside 21 shots.
 &UR; Panthers 2, Flyers 1
	   In Philadelphia, rookie Mark Parrish scored two second-period
goals and goaltender Kirk McLean made 39 saves as Florida beat
Philadelphia, extending the Flyers' winless streak to seven games.
	   Petr Svoboda scored the only goal for the Flyers, who outshot
the Panthers 40-15. Philadelphia' 0-5-2 streak matched its longest
winless streak since the 1994 club went 0-6-1.
	   The game marked the first appearance in Philadelphia for Florida
coach Terry Murray since he was fired after guiding the Flyers to
the Stanley Cup finals in 1997.

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ A student beaten in a clash with
police died Friday, following a night of protests over a special
government assembly that is trying to map out Indonesia's new
political system.
	   The armed forces chief urged people to stay at home Friday as
the military and students readied for a fourth straight day of
protests.
	   As many as 20,000 students, who are demanding democratic change
and an end of military involvement in politics, clashed with
security personnel on Thursday.
	   A spokesman at St. Carolus Hospital said Lukman Firdaus, a
female high school student, died early Friday from head injuries.
She had initially been treated at a navy hospital.
	   More than 100 students were hospitalized, some with serious
rubber bullet wounds.
	   There have been conflicting reports about how the police officer
died.
	   The Jakarta Post quoted an officer as saying protesters beat the
policeman to death at a toll road near Parliament.
	   The military's main spokesman Brig. Gen. Syamsul Ma'arif,
however, said the officer died after falling off a police truck.
	   The capital, Jakarta, was quiet Friday morning in contrast to
the pitched street battles Thursday night when police and troops
fired tear gas, rubber bullets and water cannons.
	   Military commander Gen. Wiranto warned that his forces would
take stern action to quell student unrest.
	   ``It is wise for businesses not to open,'' he told
privately-owned Radio Trijaya. ``Don't go out unless it is
necessary.''
	   Student leaders said bigger protests would be staged on Friday.
Hundreds of students were seen gathering at several Jakarta college
campuses in the morning, but there have been no immediate sign of
trouble.
	   Wiranto defended the tough action taken by his men, calling the
protests an ``unlawful attempt to forcibly occupy the parliament by
mobs.''
	   He warned that the 30,000 police and troops deployed across the
capital were prepared to take ``sterner and firmer action'' if
student protests get out of control.
	   Thursday night's violence was the worst outbreak of unrest in
Jakarta since riots forced Indonesia's former President Suharto to
quit in May after 32 years in power.
	   His successor, President B.J. Habibie, says the People's
Consultative Assembly will pave the way for free elections next
year.
	   But critics say the assembly delegates are Suharto holdovers
intent on preserving their political privileges. The student
protesters want Suharto put on trial on charges of corruption and
human rights abuses.
	   On Friday, a group of retired generals also met and declared
their opposition to the assembly and Habibie.
	   The assembly is expected to announce a date for the elections
Friday and to support new laws to legalize many political parties.

Pinochet arrest hearing ends with judges facing legal minefield

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Lawyers seeking to have Chile's former dictator
Augusto Pinochet tried on charges his military government committed
genocide, murder and torture have put their case succinctly: That's
no way for any head of state to behave.
	   At the end of a six-day appeal hearing Thursday before Britain's
highest court, all that was clear, however, is that it's not that
simple.
	   Pinochet's lawyers argued in the House of Lords that a British
law giving former heads of state immunity from prosecution is
sufficiently sweeping to protect even Adolf Hitler. They
acknowledged that may be morally regrettable, but insisted it's the
law.
	   However, they conceded that among the several thousand
allegations of secret police brutality during Pinochet's 1973-90
rule, a Spanish judge seeking the general's extradition had
included one case dated after 1988, when Britain signed onto a
convention making torture an offense anywhere.
	   The head of the five-judge tribunal, Lord Justice Gordon Slynn,
called the case ``very difficult'' and gave no indication when the
verdict would be delivered.
	   Lawyers arguing Spain's case had appealed a ruling by England's
High Court holding that Pinochet's Oct. 16 arrest was illegal
because a 1978 British act gives former heads of state immunity
from prosecution for deeds committed in office.
	   They contended that some crimes are so horrific as to defy
immunity.
	   ``Torture, hostage-taking and crimes against humanity are
conduct which international law has forbidden unequivocally
throughout the period that we are looking at,'' lawyer Christopher
Greenwood told the judges.
	   A Chilean government report says Pinochet's deeds included
responsibility for the deaths or disappearances of some 3,000
people at the hands of secret police after he toppled an elected
Marxist, President Salvador Allende.
	   Pinochet, a regular visitor to Britain, is under police guard in
a London hospital. Chile has protested his arrest, saying the
crisis risks undermining the country's new democracy.
	   A prime argument by prosecutors was that punishing dictators for
crimes against humanity is nothing new in international practice.
They cited special tribunals set up to try Bosnian Serbs and
Rwandan Hutus, and U.N. conventions.
	   Pinochet's lawyers say no ex-head of state has ever been sent
for trial before a foreign court, as opposed to special tribunals _
notably the Nuremberg trials of World War II Nazi leaders.
	   ``Even if there were only one, it would be sufficiently serious
(for extradition), even though it tends to merge into the 4,000 or
so other crimes that are alleged,'' said attorney Alun Jones,
referring to the single post-1988 torture case in the warrant _ the
death by electric torture of a 17-year-old girl.
	   The Spanish judge, seeking to try Pinochet for the deaths of
Spaniards, apparently included that case hoping the torture
convention would overrule the immunity act.
	   The charge says the teen-ager was tortured to death by military
police on Sept. 29, 1989. But in Chile, human rights investigators
said Thursday they could find no trace of the case.
	   Pinochet's lawyers argued that the general's arrest is damaging
to British-Chile relations, and suggested any trial should be in
Chile or before an international tribunal.
	   ``The question in every case in relation to sovereign immunity
is were the acts governmental acts ... in the exercise of
governmental power?'' said attorney Clive Nicholls. ``We say in the
facts of this case, they clearly were, therefore they are subject
to immunity.''
	   Meanwhile, France submitted an extradition warrant for Pinochet
on Thursday, a day after one came from Switzerland. Three French
families have filed complaints against Pinochet in France.
	   A French lawyer on Thursday released a list of 12 French and
Franco-Chilean citizens who disappeared in Argentina and Chile
during the 1970s.
	   Attorney Jacques Miquel said he suspected that the victims who
disappeared in Argentina were arrested at Pinochet's request during
Operation Condor, when several South American military juntas
teamed up to crush leftists and dissidents.
	   In Santiago, Chile's deputy foreign minister Mariano Fernandez
said Britain had promised that if the Lords release Pinochet, it
would accept no more warrants.
	   ``A ruling favoring Senator Pinochet would clear the way for his
return home,'' Fernandez told reporters.

	   At Chicago, Mats Sundin scored three goals as the Toronto Maple
Leafs routed Chicago, leaving the Blackhawks winless in their last
eight games.
	   Sundin peppered Chicago goaltender Jeff Hackett for his sixth
career hat trick. And Hackett had such a rough night he was pulled
three minutes into the final period after surrendering his fifth
and sixth goals on just 21 shots.
	   Toronto then added four goals against backup Mark Fitzpatrick,
scoring six times overall in the final period.
	   It was the first time in 10 years the Blackhawks, 0-7-1 in their
last eight, had given up 10 goals in a game. They lost 10-3 to
Boston at home in 1988.

Report: Senior Tibetan monk leaves for United States
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BEIJING (AP) _ One of Tibetan Buddhism's most respected
religious leaders has left China for the United States to protest
the government's religious policies, a monitoring group reported
Friday.
	   Agya Rinpoche, the abbot of Kumbum monastery in Qinghai
province, is one of the highest level religious figures to leave
since the Dalai Lama fled into exile in 1959.
	   The abbot appeared to have been angered by policies requiring
``patriotic education'' in Tibetan monasteries and convents and by
the Chinese government's decision to overrule the Dalai Lama's
choice for Panchen Lama, the second most revered figure in Tibetan
Buddhism, the Tibet Information Network said.
	   The London-based group said the Agya had declined to discuss his
departure with the media and it remained unclear if he planned to
seek asylum in the United States.
	   The management committee at Kumbum monastery, contacted by
telephone, would only say the abbot was on a retreat.
	   The 48-year-old Agya has played a dual role as both a top
spiritual figure and a government official. He is vice president of
the Buddhist Association of China, vice president of the All-China
Youth Federation and a vice chairman of the Qinghai provincial
committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference, a key advisory body.
	   Those divided loyalties were likely strained to the extreme by
the controversy over the selection of a boy to replace the Panchen
Lama after his death in 1989.
	   Communist Party leaders forced Tibet's Buddhist clergy to reject
a 6-year-old named by the Dalai Lama and choose another child.
	   The Agya, a devotee of the previous Panchen Lama, appears to
have resisted Chinese government efforts to install the 7-year-old
boy chosen by Beijing in Kumbum monastery, the report by Tibet
Information Network said.
	   The boy is now living in a compound in suburban Beijing instead
of at Tashilhunpho monastery, the traditional seat of the Panchen
Lama's in Shigatse, Tibet's second largest city, because of fears
for his safety. It had been thought that because Kumbum is in
Qinghai, an area also populated by ethnic Chinese and Muslims, he
would be safer than in Tibet, the network said.
