<HEADLINE> Speeding May be Blamed for Italian Train Derailment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Speeding may be blamed for the

derailment of the Milan-Rome train, which claimed at least eight

lives and injured 29 people, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
Reports said the ERT 460 high-speed "Pendolino" tilting train,

with the capability of traveling at 250 kilometers per hour (kph),

was supposed to travel at 160 kph when the accident occurred at

Piacenza's station in northern Italy this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The train was equipped with an automatic speed regulator which

enabled it to travel on a given section of track at a speed that

the signals allowed.
</P>
<P>
However, reports said the train was manually operated instead

of automatically regulated at the very moment of the accident.
</P>
<P>
The first five cars of the train overturned some 300 meters

outside Piacenza's station, blocking all traffic on the line.
</P>
<P>
The two drivers of the train were killed after the traction

unit was totally ripped apart in the crash. Two policemen, a

policewoman, a hostess in the restaurant car and two passengers

also died in the accident.
</P>
<P>
The 29 injured were sent to a local hospital, including one who

was believed in serious conditions.
</P>
<P>
The line will remain closed for 36 hours before regular train

service through Piacenza station is brought back to normal.
</P>
<P>
As the reports were unconfirmed, the reason of the accident

will be clear only after the train's "black box" was examined.
</P>
<P>
Piacenza police chief Alberto Grassi has agreed to make public

the result of the examination.
</P>
<P>
It was the second fatal railway accident in Italy within two

weeks. On December 30, two trains collided on a single-track line,

causing four deaths and injuring 15.

<HEADLINE> Japan Expects Palermo Proposal to Solve Hostage Crisis </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Japan hopes that the Peruvian

government's new proposal will lead to resumption of direct talks

with the rebels who are holding 74 hostages at the Japanese

ambassador's residence in Lima, Kyodo News reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Sadayuki Hayashi made the

remarks at a news conference on the proposal made by Peruvian

Education Minister Domingo Palermo.
</P>
<P>
Under the three-point proposal, a commission of guarantors will

be set up to mediate talks on the hostage crisis, and a timetable

and place for negotiations will be decided which are acceptable

both to the government and the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement

(MRTA).
</P>
<P>
Palermo, appointed negotiator by Peruvian President Alberto

Fujimori, said Sunday that his planned meeting with Nestor Cerpa

Cartolini, head of the MRTA, was called off because Fujimori had

refused Cartolini's demand for release of his jailed colleagues.
</P>
<P>
Though he was disappointed at the failure to resume direct

talks, Hayashi said that the communication line between the

Peruvian government and the MRTA has not been cut off.

<HEADLINE> British Ship Carrying Japanese Nuclear Wastes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A British cargo ship, Pacific

Teal, which is carrying two containers of nuclear wastes, left the

French port of Cherbourg this morning for Japan, the Agence France

Presse (AFP) quoted officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
The nuclear wastes have been reprocessed in a plant of the

French state nuclear company COGEMA in the Cape Hague bordering

the English Channel, and will be used by Japan in nuclear power

stations at home.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Louis Ricaud, the COGEMA official in charge of

reprocessing of nuclear wastes, said that the loading of the two

cargos went on normally. He said that the route of Pacific Teal

will be announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
To prevent a possible blockade of the port by the Greenpeace,

the French navy guarded the port of Cherbourg when the nuclear

wastes were loaded early this morning. The ship left at 7:00 (0600

GMT).
</P>
<P>
This is the second time since 1995 for Japan to bring back home

reprocessed nuclear wastes from France, under a contract signed

with France in 1977 and 1978.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear leakage was reported in Japan when another British ship

chartered for the shipment, Pacific Tintail, arrived in Japan. The

COGEMA denied the report.
</P>
<P>
Three routes could be used by Pacific Teal: the Panama Canal,

southern Africa and southern America.
</P>
<P>
No escort is given for Pacific Teal, which will however be

closely followed by a satellite, said the COGEMA.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Army Chief Visits Northern Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's army chief, General

Ismail Hakki Karaday, arrived today in the Turkish Cypriots

controlled northern Cyprus, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Karaday was met at the airport by Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf

Denktash, who will hold talks with him on the latest development

on the island in the Turkish-controlled northern part of

Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish General will stay two days in the

Turkish-controlled northern part of island holding meetings with

army chiefs, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
Karaday's visit follows Turkish threats against the Cyprus

government, which signed an agreement with Russia to buy S-300

surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
The deal, officially announced last week, was criticized by

the U.S. and Britain as well as some other countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller has threatened that

Turkey would strike at the missile sites when they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
However, the Cyprus government has dismissed the Turkish

threats, accusing Ciller and Denktash of escalating tension over

the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Defense Minister Costas Eliades has described the

Karaday's visit as "another attempt on the part of Turkey to

create tension".
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the

Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops landed and

seized 37 percent of the island following a short-lived coup

seeking union with Greece.

<HEADLINE> US Expert Group Begins Identification Work in South China County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XING'AN, GUANGXI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A US expert group has

begun the grim task of verification and identification of the

wreckage of a US B-24 bomber that crashed during World War II in

south China. The eight-strong team also has the job of

identifying the remains of its crew members, who perished more

than 50 years ago.
</P>
<P>
The wreckage, including a piece indicating the number of the

bomber - 40783 - and remains of the US servicemen, have been moved

from the site of the crash, a 1,828-meter-high cliff, over 90

kilometers from the Xing'an county seat. The work took two months

and 500-man hours of effort.
</P>
<P>
Alan Liotta, deputy director of US Defense Department POW/MIA

Office, expressed thanks, on behalf of the US government and the

department, to the two young farmers who discovered the wreckage,

as well as to the Chinese officials for the protection of the site.
</P>
<P>
He told a press conference: "Their efforts helped to locate the

site and bring it to our attention, so we are able to come here to

start the process of recovery and to bring these American

soldiers' remains back home."
</P>
<P>
According to a Chinese official, the crash site was in a forest

located at 110 degrees 25' 55" east longitude, and 25 degrees 52'

50" north latitude. There was no way to reach it, and it takes a

nine hour climb to arrive at the site.
</P>
<P>
The two farmers spotted by chance the damaged wing of the

crashed bomber when they climbed to the top of a tree to find a

way out of the forest.
</P>
<P>
Liotta said that preliminary investigations had shown that the

bomber belonged to US No.375 bomber squadron, a subordinate of the

"Flying Tigers".
</P>
<P>
The plane took off from an air force base in Liuzhou at 4:30

P.M. on August 31, 1944 to bomb Japanese fleets berthed at a port

in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
Since the home base of the bomber had been attacked by the

Japanese troops, the B-24 had to divert to Guilin airport. On its

way to Guilin, it disappeared for reasons still unknown. It had

been the bomber's second mission since its arrival at the base in

China.
</P>
<P>
Liotta noted that the records show that the oldest and the

youngest of the 10 male crew members were 26 and 19 years old.
</P>
<P>
The five tags of the servicemen had proved helpful for the

investigation, he said, adding that his office had already

contacted the relatives of the crew members. The relatives were

all very excited and amazed, because "in all those years, they

never knew what had happened to their loved ones. They have always

had that question, and now we are able to provide them with some

answers."
</P>
<P>
It was also announced that after the wreckage is conveyed back

the US, X-ray comparison and DNA identification will be adopted to

make conclusive identifications.
</P>
<P>
The B-24 is second crashed plane of the USAF during the Second

World War to be discovered in China. The first, with seven crew

members, was found in Tibet in 1993.

<HEADLINE> France Ready to Help Look for Solution to High Karabakh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac

said today that France is ready to contribute to seeking a

solution to the conflict in High Karabakh between Armenia and

Azerbaijan.
</P>
<P>
"France is ready to work to favor a solution between Armenia

and Azerbaijan in High Karabakh, a balanced solution between the

two countries which are, for us, friends," said Chirac during a

meeting with Azerbaijani President Gueidar Aliev.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that the conflict in High Karabakh has created a

situation of instability between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
</P>
<P>
A cease-fire has been in force since 1994 in High Karabakh, an

Azerbaijani territory with an Armenian majority in its population.
</P>
<P>
Armenia has been occupying 20 percent of the territory of

Azerbaijan after a war between the two former Soviet republics

took place in 1992 and 1993.
</P>
<P>
France is the co-president with Russia of the Minsk Conference

under the auspices of the Organization for Security and

Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) which was created in 1992 to seek a

solution to the conflict in High Karabakh.
</P>
<P>
But the Minsk Conference has never held its formal session

since its creation.
</P>
<P>
Aliev said that Azerbaijan is willing to sign a peace agreement

"on the condition that the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan is

respected, armed bands quit the territory, and refugees could go

home."
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed his will to cooperate with the OSCE, which

called for the respect of territorial integrity of Azerbaijan

during its summit in Lisbon in December 1996.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa-Syria Arms Deal to be Fixed in Late </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will not

make decision on whether it would go ahead with the proposed

3-billion Rands (638 million U.S. dollars) arms deal with Syria

until late January, a top official said today.
</P>
<P>
Deputy President Thabo Mbeki's spokesman Ricky Naidoo said the

cabinet did conditionally agree to sell Syria South Africa-made

tank firing control systems on December 4, but a final decision

would only be made by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said Mbeki was investigating whether the arms

sale would contradict the United States' Counter-Terrorism Act,

under which any country that provided lethal military equipment

to "terrorist countries" would meet American sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Syria is on Washington's list of "states that sponsor

terrorism". Earlier reports said the arms deal between Pretoria

and Damascus could lead to a conflict between the U.S. and South

Africa.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Israel, bordering with Syria and a mortal enemy

to the country, is also reported to have shown grave concern over

Pretoria-Damascus talks about the purchase of the military

equipment.

<HEADLINE> US Official: Cyprus Not to Deploy Missiles in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A senior U.S. official said

here today that Cyprus has pledged not to deploy the Russian-made

anti-aircraft missile system S-300 in the next 16 months.
</P>
<P>
Carey Cavanaugh, Director of Southern European Affairs at the

U.S. State Department, made the remarks after a meeting with

Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides this morning.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh told reporters that Clerides assured him that "not

a single component of those missile systems will be brought to

this island in the next 16 months."
</P>
<P>
He described the president's assurance as "very helpful", and

said that it should effectively defuse tension on the island.
</P>
<P>
"People should not be talking now about concerns of conflict

because that is not a problem of today," the U.S. official said.
</P>
<P>
He said he did not ask President Clerides to cancel the

decision for purchasing the S-300 missile system but repeated

U.S. concern over the issue.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh, who arrived here Sunday night, will cross into the

Turkish-controlled northern part of Nicosia to meet with Turkish

Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters that He will inform Denktash of "the

positive steps made here today", but added that he could not be

certain "whether progress can be made at this point."
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival Sunday night, Cavanaugh called on

the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides on the island to exercise

restraint, and noted that the purpose of his trip "is to help

defuse tensions and encourage future steps towards peace".
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy noted that the political atmosphere on the

island has worsened, adding that "prospects for conflict

are rising."
</P>
<P>
He also described the decision of the Cyprus government to

acquire Russian anti-aircraft missiles as a "mistake" and "a

step down a wrong path".
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh will leave this evening for Athens for talks with

Greek officials. He will also go to Ankara, Turkey, to have

similar talks with Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into two parts since 1974 when Turkish

troops landed and seized northern third of the island following

an abortive coup seeking union with Greek by some Greek Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Qatar Turns Down Proposal for Better Ties with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Qatar has refused a proposal

to improve its relations with Bahrain, according to reports

reaching here from Doha today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was worked out by a special committee formed by

the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), which held a meeting in the

Saudi Arabian capital of Riyadh Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Qatar turned down the proposal on grounds that it involved a

territorial dispute with Bahrain. The territorial dispute has

existed between the two neighbors years over the islands of

Hawar, Fasht al-Dibal and the Jaradah reefs.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, reportedly rich in gas and oil, lie just 1.5

to five kilometers off Qatar's coast and 25 to 30 kilometers from

Bahrain.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released in Doha today, Qatari Foreign Minister

Sheikh Hamad ben Jassem Bin Jaber al Thani said the proposal,

drafted by Saudi Arabia that heads the four-member mediation

committee of the GCC, was related to the Bahraini-Qatari

territorial dispute, therefore Qatar refused to accept it.
</P>
<P>
He said upon his return to Doha this morning that the Riyadh

meeting could not tackle the territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
The minister stressed that the mediation committee, which

consists of Saudi Arabia, Oman, Kuwait and the United Arab

Emirates, was set up to help improve the Bahraini-Qatari relations

rather than to resolve their territorial dispute.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Bahrain and Qatar held very different

opinions about the meeting and he hoped the two sides could get

closer in the future.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the territorial dispute between the two neighbors,

the minister said Qatar would withdraw its lawsuit from the

International Court of Justice at the Hague if Saudi Arabia, the

mediator recognized by both sides, finds out an acceptable

settlement to the dispute.
</P>
<P>
Qatar brought the territorial issue to the International Court

of Justice for arbitration, and Bahrain also presented its

arguments in the court.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, the special committee of the GCC in

charge of resolving differences between Qatar and Bahrain will

hold a third meeting in a further effort aimed at working out a

solution to solve the Qatari-Bahraini dispute.

<P>
PARIS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- France said today that it has

taken note of a declaration made by Cypriot President Glafcos

Clerides that the country will not immediately deploy the

Russian-made S-300 surface-to-air missiles.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. mediator Carey Cavanaugh, President Clerides

promised not to deploy the missiles in 16 months.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Ministry spokesman Jacques Rummelhardt today

called on Cyprus and Turkey to resume rapidly their dialogue in

order to open direct negotiations between them.
</P>
<P>
Paris expressed its concern over the sale by Russia to Cyprus

of the sophisticated defense missiles, which France said could

bring about "a risk of escalation on the island and the region

against a background of excessive arms build-up."
</P>
<P>
However, France also said that it supports "the sovereign and

legitimate right of Nicosia to provide itself with necessary

armament for self-defense."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus announced last Saturday that it would buy from Russia

the S-300 missiles, which is deliverable within a few months.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Defense Minister Turhan Tayan threatened to strike

southern Cyprus in retaliation of the deployment of the missiles,

which Ankara said are capable of striking military installations

in southern Turkey.

CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Egypt said that the tourism

industry became its second largest foreign currency earner in 1996

when tourism revenues reached 3009.1 million U.S. dollars, an

increase of 710 million dollars over the 1995 figure.

<HEADLINE> Negotiators: Difficulties Remain in Hebron Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- After several hours of

intensive negotiations in Jerusalem today, both Israeli and

Palestinian officials said that difficulties still remained to

clinch an agreement on the Israeli army redeployment in the West

Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
According to an Israel Radio report, Palestinian negotiators

claimed that Israel was trying to change nine clauses which had

already agreed upon during previous talks.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli officials denied the charge, saying it was

the Palestinian side that has raised new demands at today's

negotiations, which was aimed at concluding the Hebron accord.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, there were expectations that the success of today's

negotiations will probably lead to a summit meeting between

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian

National Authority (PNA) President Yasser Arafat later in the

day or this evening to announce the agreement.
</P>
<P>
The breakthrough followed a dramatic summit meeting late

Sunday night between Netanyahu and King Hussein of Jordan in Tel

Aviv, with the participation of US special Middle East

coordinator Dennis Ross and Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat,

as well as Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein reportedly secured a key Palestinian concession

that appears to have brought the sides much closer to a Hebron

agreement during his meeting with Arafat earlier Sunday in the

Gaza Strip before he flew with it to Tel Aviv for the late night

meeting with Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
A senior PNA official said that Arafat agreed to Hussein's

proposal that Israel could prolong its three-stage withdrawal

from West Bank rural areas, narrowing the gap on the key

sticking point in the talks.
</P>
<P>
During previous talks, Arafat has wanted all pullbacks to

conclude by September as called for in the Oslo 2 accords, while

Netanyahu's proposal was for a third pullback by the end of the

interim period, ending in the spring of 1999, so it would

overlap with the deadline for resolving final status issues.
</P>
<P>
The US put forward a compromise proposal last week calling

for the pullbacks by some point in 1998, deliberately avoiding

to give an exact month, and the Palestinians rejected the idea.
</P>
<P>
Hussein initiated a compromise proposal on a critical future

Israeli army pullback from the West Bank in the middle of 1998,

which would mark the midway point between Israeli and

Palestinian demands.
</P>
<P>
The compromise proposal was worked out during seven hours of

talks in Gaza and came amid phone calls to Netanyahu, US

Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Ross and Egyptian

President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the expectations that the Hebron deal would

finally be concluded, it appears that Israeli and the

Palestinian negotiators will have to hold, at least another

round of talks before the accord will eventually be closed.
</P>
<P>
The talks, temporarily halted so as the Palestinian

delegations could travel to the Gaza Strip to brief Arafat, are

due to resume this evening, according the Israel Radio report.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian officials are now saying that the Hebron accord

"may be signed tomorrow (Tuesday)."

<HEADLINE> Tajik Warring Parties Agree on Return of Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A Tajik opposition leader said

here today the Tajik government and opposition leaders agreed to

repatriate the Tajik refugees and an agreement to this effect

will be signed later today.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the Tajik government and the

opposition, which began from January 6 and are expected to last

for another week, focus on creation of a reconciliation

commission and participation of the opposition group in the

government, according to Akbar Turjanzadeh, Deputy Chairman of

League of Tajik opposition.
</P>
<P>
The Tajik government is represented by the republic's Foreign

Minister Talbak Nazarow while Akbar Turjanzadeh is present on

behalf of the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, U.N. special

envoy to Tajikistan Gerd Merrem and Russian Ambassador Sergei

Tretyakov and some CIS countries' diplomats were also present at

the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA today quoted Turjanzadeh as

saying "the composition of the national reconciliation commission

is a stumbling block. The opposition has proposed that the

commission be composed of 40 members."
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the government representatives insist that only 10

people should make up the commission," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition's proposal envisaged 40 members

for the commission, 16 from the government, 16 from the

opposition and eight from the national revival pact.
</P>
<P>
"But the government representatives to the talks did not

accept the proposal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turjanzadeh said the opposition reduced the number of the

members on the commission to 34, 40 percent of which from the

government side, 40 percent from the opposition side and the

remaining 20 percent to be decided by the leaders of the

belligerent parties in their future meetings.
</P>
<P>
But the government is willing to give a 20 to 25 percent

quota to the opposition in the composition of the national

reconciliation commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said guaranteeing the safety of the commission members is

another problem faced by the Tehran meeting, adding that the

opposition believes that 700 of its fighters should be based in

Dushanbe to protect the commission members in cooperation with

the government troops.
</P>
<P>
But, neither the government nor the United Nations has

accepted the proposal on the grounds that the presence of Muslim

combatants would forment tension, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Merrem, special representative of the

U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on Tajikistan, said at a press

conference held Sunday that the United Nations has put forward a

draft document for an end to the civil war in Tajikistan.
</P>
<P>
He said that the draft was drawn on some agreements of the

Tajik government and Islamic opposition. However, he declined to

go into detail about the draft document, which was earlier

presented to the two warring parties at the negotiating table in

Tehran.

<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Iraq's Patriotic

Union of Kurdistan (PUK) Jalal Talebani met with Iranian Foreign

Minister Ali Akbar Velayati here today.
</P>
<P>
The state-run Tehran Radio reported that the two sides

discussed the present situation in Iraqi Kurdistan bordering Iran

the Kurdish refugees who became homeless because of clashes.
</P>
<P>
He called for further humanitarian assistance from the

Iranian government to the Kurds in Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Velayati for his part reiterated Iran's position on seeking a

peaceful resolution to the fighting in Iraqi Kurdistan and

promised that Iran would offer its assistance to Iraqi Kurdish

refugees.
</P>
<P>
+The Islamic Republic of Iran would not stop offering its

help, and would not hesitate to create a situation to lessen the

pains of the Kurdish refugees,+ he added.

JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister

Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian National Authority(PNA)

President Yasser Arafat are tentatively scheduled to meet at

Erez Checkpoint at midnight tonight, announced the prime

minister's media adviser.
</P>
<P>
According to the announcement, there will be no press

<HEADLINE> Third Round of Talks on Northern Iraq Starts in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The third round of talks on the

northern Iraq issue started here today in a bid to bring peace and

stability to the unrest-ridden area.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Britain and Iraq's three parties -- the

Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan

(PUK) and Turkmen Front -- are participating in the talks

co-chaired by Turkey and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Northern Iraq has been split into rival zones since the PUK and

KDP began fighting in 1994.
</P>
<P>
According to diplomatic sources here, the main topics to be

discussed at the meeting include confidence-building measures,

ceasefire monitoring groups, clarifications of controlled areas as

well as humanitarian aid to the region.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the talks, Turkish Foreign

Ministry Undersecretary Onur Oymen said that all the problems

should be evaluated on the basis of respecting Iraq's sovereignty

and territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Robert Pelletreau, for his

part, called for a broad cooperation among the parties concerned

so as to put an end to violence in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Sami Abdurrahman, head of the KDP delegation, expressed the

determination not to spoil the ceasefire reached on October 30,

1996.
</P>
<P>
PUK representative Muhammed Tevfik called for speeding up the

solution to the existing problems, adding that all of the sides

concerned should intensify efforts to achieve speedy political

compromise.
</P>
<P>
The British delegation, headed by Frank Baker, also expressed

the satisfaction with the developments concerning the northern

Iraq issue, saying that he was optimistic about possible fruits

of the third round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Turkmen Front leader Sinan Celebi urged the negotiators to work

out a solution to all problems.
</P>
<P>
PUK leader Jalal Talabani is reportedly planning to meet

separately with Turkish, U.S. and British officials in Ankara.

But he himself will not be present in the talks.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is still no confirmation whether KDP leader

Massoud Barzani will come to Ankara during the talks.
</P>
<P>
The first and second rounds of talks on the northern Iraq

issue have produced a cease-fire and also a comprehensive peace

deal, which was agreed by both PUK and KDP.
</P>
<P>
The need for the talks came after when the KDP forces, backed

by the Iraqi government troops, captured vast expanses of

northern Iraq late August last year. Baghdad's support for KDP led

to the U.S. air strike against Iraqi military targets.
</P>
<P>
The third round of talks here is expected to be concluded on

Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Supports UN Peace Efforts in Afghanistan: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan is ready to provide

necessary strength for the United Nations' efforts to establish a

lasting peace in Afghanistan, President Farooq Leghari said today.
</P>
<P>
At a press conference in Pakistan's northwestern city of

Peshawar, Leghari said that "for effecting a lasting peace there,

it is necessary to solve the Afghan crises under the United

Nations supervision."
</P>
<P>
"We are ready to play the role of a facilitator and do not want

to interfere in its internal affairs," local reports quoted him as

saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "Pakistan has never interfered in Afghanistan

as we strictly believe in the policy of non-interference."
</P>
<P>
Leghari noted that Pakistan, which now provides humanitarian

support for millions of Afghan refugees, is earnestly hoping for

an early solution to the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
He said that the 1.2 million Afghan refugees who are staying in

Pakistan all want to go back to their country with honor and

dignity.
</P>
<P>
However, efforts for the reconstruction and development in

Afghanistan cannot be started until peace is established there,

said Leghari.
</P>
<P>
He said that Central Asian republics like Turkmenistan,

Uzbekistan and Tajikistan could play a significant role in solving

the Afghan issue.
</P>
<P>
On Pakistan's relations with its other neighbors, Leghari said

that his country is enjoying extremely cordial and friendly

relations with China and Iran.
</P>
<P>
He said that relations with China are not only cordial but have

also been promoted greatly in the recent past.
</P>
<P>
"We have full confidence in their friendship as it stood the

test of time," he said.
</P>
<P>
On relations with Iran, Leghari said that Pakistan and Iran are

tied in bonds of religion and have common interests.
</P>
<P>
He refuted reports that neighboring countries are trying to

capture the markets of Central Asian republics, saying that these

countries are not a "cake."
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan, Iran and Afghanistan should jointly work for

the economic development of these countries.

<HEADLINE> China Builds 381 Pilot Residential Quarters in Cities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of

Construction has built 381 pilot residential quarters in urban

areas throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The move is designed to improve the quality of the country's

housing stock and provide models for the country's house builders,

according to a national conference on construction which opened

today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
An official in charge of the construction of the experimental

residential quarters said that the ministry has set high

standards for building materials, design, landscaping and other

auxiliary facilities in the building of the pilot homes. Every

project completed should have a 100 percent ratio of certification.
</P>
<P>
China carries out housing construction at an annual rate of 200

million square meters. To realize the goal of increasing the per

capita living space of urban residents to nine sq m by the year

2000, China needs to complete the building of apartments with a

combined floor space of 240 million sq m each year before the turn

of the century.
</P>
<P>
"Speaking from an overall point of view, the quality of China's

housing construction is not so high, and there also exist many

problems in the aspects such as house design," said the official,

who stressed the necessity of building more experimental

residential quarters in different areas as a reference for

builders.
</P>
<P>
The campaign of building experimental residential quarters was

first launched in 1986. The program has helped improve the overall

quality of the country's apartment buildings.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the average ratio of certification for newly-completed

flats was above 80 percent.
</P>
<P>
Different provinces, municipalities and autonomous regions are

urged to attain the goal of building 10 percent of the flats

according to the standards for experimental residential quarters

by the end of this year, and building 25 percent of the flats

according to the same standards by the year of 2000.

KATHMANDU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Senior Nepali officials have

called for integrated regional efforts in harnessing water

resources in the eastern Himalayan region, the official news

</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani told a seminar here

last weekend that South Asian countries should harness the natural

resources of the region in a spirit of cooperation and

understanding, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The two-day seminar on "Regional Cooperation in Harnessing

Eastern Himalayan Rivers" was attended by some 70 participants,

including policy-makers, water resources experts and intellectuals

resources that could be utilized in a sustainable manner to

upgrade the economic development of the region, Rana said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Allocates Special Funds to Confront US </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) --The Iranian parliament endorsed

today 25 billion Iranian rials (8.3 million U.S. dollars) for

work aimed at confronting U.S. "conspiracies against the

country", local Persian evening paper Kayhan reported.
</P>
<P>
The special fund was approved by the parliament in the new

year's budget at an open session presided over by Iran's

hardliner Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Nateq-Nouri this morning.
</P>
<P>
Some of the special fund will be used to promote Iran's claims

and cases at national and international courts and forums

regarding the U.S. cultural invasion directed against Iran,

according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
The report said the decision came under Note 55 to be attached

to the new year's budget starting from March 21, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Last January, Iran's parliament endorsed a 20-million-dollar

budget to counter U.S. covert action against the Islamic regime

and to finance activities against the U.S..
</P>
<P>
The budget was boosted from an initial 16 million dollars and

is a reaction to Washington's move to give its secret service 20

million dollars for action aimed at moderating Iran's Islamic

government.

<HEADLINE> France Calls on Iraq to Fully Apply UN Resolutions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de

Charette today called on Iraq to fully carry out the United

Nations resolutions over Iraq, especially that on its disarmament

of massive destruction weapons.
</P>
<P>
De Charette made the call during a meeting with visiting Iraqi

Vice Prime Minister Tarek Aziz.
</P>
<P>
"I again told Mr. Aziz that only full cooperation by Iraq with

the United Nations Special Commission and the International Agency

of Atomic Energy will shed light on the last questions which

remain in suspense," said the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He was referring to the remaining U.N. sanctions on Iraq after

the U.N. relaxed its six-year embargo on Baghdad last December

under the program of "Oil for Food," which allows Iraq to export

2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil to buy food and medicines.
</P>
<P>
"It is clear that the announcement by the Special Commission

(led by Swedish Rolf Ekeus) of conclusions on Iraq's obligations

in the field of arms of massive destruction will make up the prior

condition for lifting the oil embargo, in conformity with

paragraph 22 of resolution 687," said de Charette.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that only a small part of this resolution remains to

be applied by Iraq. He did not specify which part of the

resolution that is.

<HEADLINE> China, Visa Cooperate in First Credit Card Training Center </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- One of the China's top

education bases, the Chinese People's University (CPU) and the

world's leading credit card group, Visa International, today

launched a credit card research and training center in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The center, the first of it kind in China, is jointly sponsored

by the university and Visa International.
</P>
<P>
Guided by the People's Bank of China, the country's central

bank, the center will specialize in the research of China's credit

card business and the training of senior professionals for

financial institutions, aiming to promote the technology of

banking computerization in China.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the center's opening ceremony, CPU's president Li

Wenhai said that country's electronic money program, featured by a

nationwide use of the credit card, is playing a vital role both in

China's drive for an advanced information industry and the

national economic development.
</P>
<P>
The number of credit cards of China is predicted to mount

rapidly along with the economic take-off.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the current figure of 20 million cards, China

will issue 200 million credit cards by 2003, accounting for one

fifth of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Supported by the sophisticated technological benchmark and

management style of Visa International, as well as CPU's rich

resources in financial education and research, the center will

play an important role in the credit card promotion drive in

China, and help domestic businesses to adopt international

practices as soon as possible, Li added.
</P>
<P>
Visa International president Edmund Jensen said that in

foreseeable future the two partners will launch credit card

courses for the first time in Chinese universities.
</P>
<P>
To sponsor the country's financial education, Visa

International will also provide one million yuan to establish the

"Chinese People's University Visa Funds," Jensen said.

<HEADLINE> Top Academy Urges More Quality Jobs by Its Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Researchers at the prestigious

Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (CASS) should achieve academic

goals of higher quality and avoid wasting time on useless

subjects, an official suggested today.
</P>
<P>
"All research staff are required to obtain creative

achievements which may have a great influence on society and on

academic circles," said Wang Renzhi, deputy president of the CASS,

at the opening of its annual work meeting in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
A few researchers and scholars at CASS, China's top research

body on social sciences, allegedly only care about the quantity of

research subjects and exaggerate their academic achievements, Wang

claimed.
</P>
<P>
Facing an international academic challenge, and its own fast

development, the 20-year-old research body is expected to generate

more scholars and management professionals.
</P>
<P>
Wang said that the CASS will invest another specific research

fund worth one million yuan (about 120,000 US dollars) to reward

good performers on key academic research projects, stimulating

every institute under the CASS to boost one or two academic

qualities every year.
</P>
<P>
The 2,000-strong research headquarters accomplished several

hundred projects in 1996, some of them in the world-leading

position, CASS officials said.
</P>
<P>
As part of an adjustment plan on research subjects, CASS plans

to safeguard financial investment and personnel support for key

projects which have the edge on its competitors, while blazing the

trail of some fields in urgent need of scientific research, Wang

added.

<HEADLINE> Ogata to Travel to Great Lakes Region for Refugee Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- U.N. High Commissioner for

Refugees (UNHCR) Sadako Ogata will tour the Great Lakes region in

Africa on February 6-15 to discuss with regional leaders the

refugee issue, a UNHCR spokeswoman said here today.
</P>
<P>
"She'll be using her visit to discuss a number of issues,

including the recent repatriations of Rwandan refugees from Zaire

and Tanzania, and ways of ensuring the welfare of refugees still

remaining in the region," said Pam O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
Ogata is scheduled to visit Burundi, Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda

and Zaire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Dennis McNamara, the UNHCR's international

protection division director, has travelled to the region to try

to consult with the Tanzanian government on initiating a screening

procedure for thousands of Rwandan refugees who wish to remain in

Tanzania, O'Toole told the same news briefing.
</P>
<P>
"During his stay, he will also be raising the issue of the 122

Burundian refugees who were killed by Burundian security forces

after being apparently expelled from Tanzania last Friday," said

O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
"We are shocked and dismayed by last Friday's incident," he

added.
</P>
<P>
O'Toole said the UNHCR is aware that those expelled were

alleged to have been involved in violent demonstrations in refugee

camps in Tanzania among rival Burundian groups. But the Burundian

army said they were trying to escape a detention center.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR is "appealing to the Tanzanian government that there

should be no expulsions at a time when a return to Burundi is

generally not safe," said O'Toole.
</P>
<P>
"We hope to receive assurances from the authorities that firm

instructions will be given to avoid such incidents in the future."
</P>
<P>
Tanzania Tuesday denied it had expelled the refugees from camps

in its territory.
</P>
<P>
O'Toole said there should be measures to separate any armed

elements in the camps from the civilian population in this complex

situation.
</P>
<P>
"We'd like to continue to work closely with the Tanzanian

authorities on resolving current problems. However, we also have

to appreciate the role Tanzania continues to play as an asylum

country. It currently holds more than 220,000 Burundian refugees

and continues to receive hundreds more each day," she said.
</P>
<P>
Zairean and Burundian refugees began to flock to Tanzania since

the beginning of the year to escape fighting in the countries.

America woman reporter injured on her way back from covering the

investigation into a crashed World War II US bomber has been sent

to a hospital in the Chinese city of Guilin tonight.
</P>
<P>
Due to the bad weather and slippery roads, it took over four

her face looked pale.
</P>
<P>
Officials at the scene said that the injury to the back of her

head was not serious, and further examination should be carried

out to determine if there is any internal injuries.

China will also basically complete the installation of the

300,000-kw Chashma Nuclear Power Plant, a project exported to

Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The official urged all nuclear departments to have a greater

sense of responsibility, improve management systems, and enhance

the safety of nuclear materials and nuclear facilities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the CNNC will set up a joint meeting system and a

regular coordination meeting system to exclusively research the

construction of nuclear power projects, and solve problems jointly

and quickly.
</P>
<P>
Over the past year China's two functioning nuclear power

plants, Qinshan and Daya Bay, have maintained stable and safe

operation. And both of the plants have been refueled and

overhauled for a second time.
</P>
<P>
In 1996 the two plants generated a total of 14 billion kilowatt

hours of electricity, exceeding the state-set quota. The Qinshan

plant operated to full capacity for a record 188 consecutive days,

and Daya Bay plant passed safety checks conducted by the

International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
Surveys have found that the amount of waste discharged by

Qinshan and Daya Bay meet government-set standards, posing no harm

to the surrounding environment, and helping to build a good image

for China's nuclear power industry, Jiang noted.
</P>
<P>
``The safe operation of the two plants has stepped up China's

confidence in building more nuclear power plants in coastal

areas," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Japanese cabinet ministers in

charge of finance and economy today discussed the recent sharp

falls in domestic stock prices, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
Reports quoted Finance Minister Hiroshi Mitsuzuka as saying

that the current stock market is mired in uncertainties with no

clear direction and that close watch on the developments is needed.
</P>
<P>
Taku Yamasaki, chairman of the ruling Liberal Democratic

Party's Policy Affairs Research Council, said, "The Finance

Ministry should deal with the matter in a more specific manner

rather than just closely watching market movements."
</P>
<P>
He said that some measures may be necessary to help companies

which close their trade in March.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mitsuzuka said the government will make efforts to

ensure an early passage of the fiscal 1996 supplementary budget

and fiscal 1997 budget.
</P>
<P>
He added that sweeping reform plans should be implemented as

quickly as possible to change the economic structure and other

systems, as well as to support the budding recovery in

private-sector demand through deregulation.
</P>
<P>
Kabun Muto, director general of the Management and Coordination

Agency, also called for measures to make the lackluster stock

market more attractive to foreign investors.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong to Stop Illegal Levies on Foreign Investors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tang Bingquan, deputy

governor of south China's Guangdong Province, has called for

effective measures to be taken to safeguard the province's foreign

investment growth this year.
</P>
<P>
The southern province witnessed a 14 percent increase of

foreign investment in actual use last year, topping 13.9 billion

dollars, the Chinese official said at the province's conference on

foreign trade and economic cooperation in Guangzhou today.
</P>
<P>
One of the most important factors that will determine a

successive growth of foreign investment this year is to improve

the province's "soft" investment environment, Tang said.
</P>
<P>
Illegal levies must be stopped, he said, adding that they

undermined foreign investors' confidence and the province's

attractiveness for foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
Anyone or any governmental organs that force illegal levies on

foreign investors will be punished, he warned.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, measures are to be taken to crack down on crimes

involving fraud and blackmail of foreign investors to guarantee

the security of their lives and property, he added.
</P>
<P>
The province is to make efforts to improve the working

efficiency of governmental organs, and to simplify the procedures

for approving foreign-funded projects.
</P>
<P>
The province will help create a sound market environment for

both home and overseas investors this year by cracking down on

smuggling and illegal competition, he promised.

BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Moody's Investor Services

Incorporated, one of the leading international business

appraisers, has assigned a rating of A3 to the long-term cross

border foreign currency debt of the Import and Export Bank of

China.
</P>
<P>
According to Moody's, the rating reflects the close links

between the bank and the Chinese central government, due in

particular to its function as an instrument of state policy and

economic development.
</P>
<P>
In early 1996, the long-term debt of the bank was rated AA- by

the Japan Bond Research Institute, one of the leading rating firms in

Japan.
</P>
<P>
The bank successfully issued a five-year bond of 20 billion

Japanese yuan in the capital market of Japan in August 1996.

<HEADLINE> 1997 Focuses: Basic Education, Illiteracy Elimination, Higher Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China will spare no efforts to

promote basic education, eliminate illiteracy and reform its

higher learning management system in 1997.
</P>
<P>
This was the message from Zhu Kaixuan, minister in charge of

the State Education Commission (SEC), at a national conference on

education held today in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Management of colleges and universities affiliated to

ministries and departments of the central government are to be

transferred partly or totally to local governments.
</P>
<P>
All colleges and universities of China will be fee-charging in

the autumn when the new semester usually start. This year China

plans to enroll 1.01 million new students.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged ministries, departments and local governments to

experiment in providing student loans in colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that in 1996 over 60 colleges and universities

became co-sponsored by the central and local governments.
</P>
<P>
Another 118 colleges and universities were merged into 50, and

about 200 colleges and universities were jointly run in various

forms. The total number of China's colleges and universities

dropped to 1,032.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about two thirds of China's colleges and

universities charged students for the college education they

receive. The fee makes up 10 to 20 percent of the real cost that

the government spends in training each college student.
</P>
<P>
The eastern part of China, the most developed area of the

country, has reached the goal of basically popularizing nine-year

compulsory education. The area has virtually eliminated illiteracy

among people born since 1949 when new China was founded.
</P>
<P>
The future task for these areas will be turning a test-oriented

education into a more quality-emphasized system. Zhu said that the

SEC decided to create a more flexible climate for the change, by

changes to the system of entrance examinations to junior middle

schools, high schools and colleges.
</P>
<P>
The SEC is also seeking good experiences of quality-oriented

education, and is ready to popularize those experiences nationwide.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the focus in 1997 of the popularization of basic

education and illiteracy elimination will be China's central

parts, consisting of 12 provinces. He expects 55 percent of

China's 1.2 billion people to become literate and able to enjoy

nine-year compulsory education. The indicator was 50 percent by

the end of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Poverty-stricken areas and areas mostly inhabited by ethnic

minorities are being requested to continue popularizing primary

school education to help reduce illiteracy.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Boston Seeks Further Cooperation in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Boston of the

United States has had links with China for over 200 years. Now it

is continuing to seek opportunities for cooperation with Chinese

banks, government organizations and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The Chairman of Bank of Boston, William Crozier, today

described the bank's involvement in China at a news briefing to a

group of local and foreign journalists.
</P>
<P>
The American banker is in China mainly to donate one million

yuan to primary and middle schools in southwest China's Sichuan

Province.
</P>
<P>
Staff of the US bank have also set up a 3,000 US dollar fund to

grant prizes to outstanding students at the schools.
</P>
<P>
Mr. Crozier told reporters that since 1979, his bank "has

financed a significant portion of Sino-US trade," and on the other

hand, it has also arranged a number of medium to long-term,

low-cost overseas loans for projects by Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
"The growth in China's economy and China's recent financial

reforms have created new opportunities for us," he said, noting

<HEADLINE> China's Largest Bank Praised For Fruitful Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Zhu Rongji today

praised the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the

largest bank in the country, for its strenuous and fruitful

efforts in 1996. He said he believes the bank will do an even

better job this year.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier made the remarks at today's opening session of

the bank's annual meeting, attended by governors of its provincial

branches.
</P>
<P>
In his speech, Zhu highlighted the role of the bank in

financing state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The bank's new president, Liu Tinghua, who has replaced

outgoing ICBC President Zhang Xiao, made a key-note speech at the

meeting, which was held at Zhongnanhai in Beijing, the

headquarters of the central government.
</P>
<P>
ICBC managed to meet all of its targets last year Liu said,

adding that it also made progress in its computerized-banking

program, with over 80 percent of its branches now linked to an

electronic clearing system. On the other hand however, much work

has also been done to improve the quality of bank staff.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, ICBC increased its deposits by 341.6 billion yuan, to

a total of 1.8 trillion yuan, 114 percent of the planned

amount. Outstanding loans increased by 221.7 billion yuan to top

1.65 trillion yuan, 112 percent of the target figure.
</P>
<P>

the end of last year rose to 11.3 billion US dollars and 8.8

billion US dollars, up 800 million US dollars and 400 million US

dollars respectively, with both reaching the targets.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, ICBC issued over 2.6 million credits cards, bringing

the total number to over 8.5 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The bank cropped in 14.5 billion yuan in operational profits,

an increase of 9.9 billion yuan over last year, while it handed

over 9.9 billion yuan to the state treasury.

<HEADLINE> Relief Aid Airdropped to Snow Trapped Surveyors in Xinjiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-five geological surveyors

have been located by Chinese soldiers after being trapped

for nearly ten days in unprecedented snowstorms in the Altay

Prefecture in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
The Xinjiang Military Area Command air dropped 300 kilograms of

food and medicines, as well as a radio, generators and other aid

material to the 25, marooned by deep snow.
</P>
<P>
The military also air dropped 2.5 tons of rice, flour, and

medicines to more than 900 local gold miners who are also trapped

by fierce snowstorms in Fuyun County, easing a dangerous situation

for them.
</P>
<P>
Four people still remain missing in the Altay area. Since a

snowstorm hit the prefecture on December 24, the avalanche and

extreme cold have killed 12 people, injured 23 others and resulted

in economic losses of 100 million yuan (12 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
So far the prefecture has raised more than 25 million yuan

(about 3 million US dollars) for relief work, but the rescue

remains a difficult task because of the extreme weather conditions.
</P>
<P>
Latest government reports say that in the area along the Altay

Mountains, nearly 5,000 families are without food, with more than

30,000 people starving, and more than 10,300 people

trapped.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 1.023 million head of farm animals are unable to

find or hunt for food because of two meter deep snow.
</P>
<P>
Following the disaster, the wages of local workers and

officials' and their heating subsidies for January, amounting to

12 million yuan, have been completely used for relief fund.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the Xinjiang regional government have rushed to

the area to meet victims of the snowstorms and organize relief

work. The Altay Prefectural government has called on people to

fight for 100 days against the natural disaster.
</P>
<P>
Citizens in Altay City have made more than 100,000 fodder bags

for the disaster-stricken area and donated 10,000 yuan and

clothing. Civil affairs departments have also issued 950,000

yuan of relief funding.
</P>
<P>
The prefecture has also sent more than 1,200 officials and

doctors to pastoral areas to help snow stricken herdsmen.
</P>
<P>
Facing deep snow, and a shortage of money and materials, local

government officials are concerned about the rescue of tens of

thousands of herdsmen living along the Altay Mountains. They also

face the daunting task of providing fodder to millions of farm

animals, rebuilding storm-wrecked houses, and helping herdsmen

survive the winter.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin

said in Beijing today that more Sino-US economic cooperation and

closer trade ties will help create an open and healthy

international economic climate, and promote regional and global

economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came during a meeting between Jiang and the US

Senate's Finance Committee Chairman Williams Roth, who is on a

visit to China.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Jiang expressed appreciation for Roth's

efforts in helping to improve and develop Sino-US relations,

especially in supporting the unconditional renewal of China's Most

Favored Nation status.
</P>
<P>
China is the biggest developing nation, and the United States

is the biggest developed nation, Jiang said, adding that the two

economies are strongly complementary to each other. The range for

cooperation between China and the US are broad, added the

President.
</P>
<P>
He said that maintaining and developing trade and economic

cooperation between the two countries is not only in line with the

fundamental interests of the two nations, but beneficial to the

creation of an open and healthy international economic climate,

and to the enhancement of regional and global economic prosperity.
</P>
<P>
The world is witnessing a rapid growth in science and

technology as well as closer economic links between various

countries, Jiang noted, adding that great potential is yet to be

tapped in Sino-US trade and economic cooperation, which has

maintained a momentum of development.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China is willing to make concerted

efforts with the United States to create favourable conditions for

the long-term and stable development of bilateral trade and

economic ties by removing any man-made obstacles.
</P>
<P>
On the question of Taiwan, Jiang said that it has a bearing on

China's state sovereignty, territorial integrity and the country's

cause of reunification, and it is an issue influencing the

feelings of the Chinese people. Therefore, he stressed, it has

been always a most important and most sensitive issue in Sino-US

relations.
</P>
<P>
Whether the issue is properly handled or not is decisive to the

development of Sino-US relationship, Jiang said. China is willing

to work together with the US to increase their common

understanding, develop bilateral cooperation, and bring to the

21th century a healthy and stable bilateral relationship based on

the three joint communiques signed by both countries.
</P>
<P>
The president said that China hopes the US government and its

Congress will carefully handle the Taiwan issue, and avoid any

interference to the steady development of Sino-US relations by any

mishandling of the issue.
</P>
<P>
Roth said that both China and the US are great countries

sharing an interest in many issues. For the US, he said, the

relationship with China is one of America's most important

bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
He said that a stable and powerful US-Chinese relationship is

not only in line with the common interests of the two nations, but

also serves the interests of the Asia-Pacific region and the world.
</P>
<P>
Roth said that he understands the value China sets on the

Taiwan issue, and he agrees with China's position that there is

only one China in the world.
</P>
<P>
He said that he has always supported the unconditional renewal

of China's Most Favored Nation status. The MFN treatment is

actually not a preferential one. Instead, he said, it is a normal

trade arrangement between China and the US, serving as a

foundation for bilateral trade, and is therefore beneficial to

both countries.

significant development is achieved.

The Cuban officials said Cuba's gross domestic product (GDP)

increased 7.8 percent in 1996, and the number of tourists visiting

the country jumped 30 percent to more than one million.

<HEADLINE> Artists Across Taiwan Straits Exhibit Art Works for Reunification </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- More than 150 artists from both

sides of the Taiwan Straits are holding an exhibition of paintings

and calligraphy at the Art Gallery of China in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, which opened today, is sponsored by the China

Council for the Promotion of Peaceful National Reunification

(CCPPNR). It is part of a series of activities to mark the second

anniversary of President Jiang Zemin's speech on the reunification

of the nation.
</P>
<P>
"Our long history and splendid culture shared by people living

across the Straits always serve as a tight tie to maintain our

nation together, and thus are an important foundation for the

nation to achieve its goal of reunification," said Qian Weichang,

president of CCPPNR.
</P>
<P>
He said that through various kinds of cross-straits exchanges

and cooperation, all Chinese people will strengthen their resolve

to reunify the motherland.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition, with 21 pieces of art from Taiwan, will

last for four days.
</P>
<P>
Yan Mo, a 31 year old calligrapher from northwest China's

Shaanxi province, wrote a poem about Yu Youren, one of the

founding members of the Kuomintang, for the exhibition,

saying: "The younger generation should learn from history and make

contributions to the great cause of reunification."
</P>
<P>
According to Li Shengxu, secretary-general of CCPPNR, the

council has won wide support from a large number of overseas

Chinese since it was established in 1988.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Works out Standards for Computers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A regulation setting a

standard for computer products will take effect in Shanghai on

March 1.
</P>
<P>
It will make the city the first place in China to introduce

such standards. So far the country has not worked out regulations

intended for nationwide use.
</P>
<P>
The rule is considered as a move to ensure the interests of

computer buyers in the city, since only 30 percent of the 36 kinds

of computers made in Shanghai are standard products.
</P>
<P>
According to the rules, computer producers have to inform

consumers the name of the brand of computer, type, standard code,

license of their computer products, as well as the name of the

production plants, and functions of the machines.
</P>
<P>
Computer producers must also mark their registered name and

factory addresses on the machines, and also on packaging, the

regulation states.
</P>
<P>
Imported computers should contain details of where they were

made, and details about their Chinese importers.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Former Japanese Prime Minister

Noboru Takeshita urged his country and China to further promote

bilateral dialogue to help realize exchange of visits by leaders

of the two countries, the Yomiuri daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
He said both Japan and China should make efforts to create a

favorable political environment this year, which is the 25th

anniversary of the normalization of diplomatic relations between

the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Relations between China and Japan became tense last year as

they were sharply divided over the explanation of the strengthened

Japan-U.S. Security Treaty, visits to Yasukuni Shrine by Japanese

cabinet ministers, the Diaoyu Islands and the perception of

history, the Yomiuri Shimbun quoted Takeshita as saying.
</P>
<P>
Takeshita was prime minister between November 1987 and June

1989.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Japanese relationship, however, has improved following

foreign ministerial talks during the U.N. General Assembly session

in September and summit talks on the fringe of an informal

leadership meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum

in the Philippines in November, Takeshita said.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news

items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- While 61 percent of the French people support a law on early

retirement at the age of 55 "to create new jobs," President

Jacques Chirac, his government, the socialists, and almost all

trade unions are opposed to such a measure, which they called

"impossible."
</P>
<P>
-- To meet the challenge of the escalating labor movement which

began on December 26, the South Korean government has mobilized

thousands of soldiers to take over major public sectors which

could be affected by the strike. The strike, which has been

ravaging major industrial conglomerates such as Hyundai and

Daewoo, has spread to the sectors of public transport, banks and

railways.
</P>
<P>
-- After a long meeting of its executive committee, Bulgaria's

ruling Socialist Party (PSB) Monday agreed to "accept the

principle of holding early elections within the framework of a

national anti-crisis program." The PSB is yet to adopt an economic

stability program, and said that it is ready to negotiate with the

opposition about "the character and make-up" of a new socialist

government.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- The Paris Bourse Monday beat a three-year record with its

CAC 40 index attaining 2,361,27 points, a 1.45 percent rise over

the previous day and much higher than the 2,355,93 point record

registered on February 2, 1994.
</P>
<P>
-- The Israeli right-wingers, which opposed the withdrawal of

Israeli troops from the West Bank town of Hebron, demonstrated on

Monday in front of a hotel, in which Israeli and Palestinian

negotiators resumed talks on the last details of an agreement on

the withdrawal. The protesters said that the troops withdrawal

means death for the Jews living in the Palestinian town.
</P>
<P>
-- The stand-off is continuing in South Korea between the

government, which refuses to amend the new labor legislation, and

trade unions, which are keeping the call of general strike today.

<HEADLINE> Beijing Tightens Controls on Security Guards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital has

tightened supervision of its security guards by hiring 30 people

to oversee the security business.
</P>
<P>
The new supervisors come from government institutions and big

companies in the East District and have the job of improving

discipline in local security guard services, which began in the

city ten years ago.
</P>
<P>
The supervisors will make regular reviews of the guards and

their professional ethics, management skills, work style, dress,

and language, and will offer suggestions on how to improve the

work to get security work better regulated.
</P>
<P>
Security guards are mainly employed as gate keepers, for guard

duty and for patrols. Many are young people who come from outside

Beijing. Some retired policemen are also hired as advisers by

security companies.
</P>
<P>
There are 31,000 security guards in Beijing, employed by some

3,000 units. The East District alone has 2,200 guards serving 260

government institutions and enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Some sources maintain that the security business is not very

well regulated at present and that some of the guards are not well

trained, affecting the quality of work in the local security

business.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Iraq Urges UN to Lift Embargo on Iraqi Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi National Assembly

Speaker Sadoon Hamadi, who is on a visit here, today urged the

United Nations Security Council to lift the embargo on his

country's oil export.
</P>
<P>
"Iraq has fulfilled all the requirements of the Security

Council Resolution 687 and it is now the time for the Security

Council to implement Paragraph 22 (of the resolution) to lift the

embargo on the export of oil," Sadoon said at a news conference

here.
</P>
<P>
He said that the force formed by troops from the United States

and Britain now stationed in Turkey is "an aggressive force" and

that "it is interfering in the internal affairs of our country."
</P>
<P>
He said the force has no legal basis and it is imposing a

"no-fly zone" in the northern and southern parts of Iraq without

any mandate from the UN Security Council or the UN General

Assembly.
</P>
<P>
"It is an action taken against international law," said Sadoon,

who is former prime minister of Iraq.
</P>
<P>
He said by imposing the embargo on Iraq, the United States

wanted to change the regime in the country. But "the regime (in

Iraq) proves to be strong."
</P>
<P>
"Very soon the United States will find itself in a very

difficult position and they have to kneel to international

pressure and to accept the fact," Sadoon said.
</P>
<P>
He said he had explained to Malaysian leaders that Iraq's

agreement with the UN to export limited crude oil is a relief and

should be looked upon as a temporary measure which he said "should

be followed by lifting the embargo and it is not an alternative to

lifting the sanctions."
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and

other Malaysian leaders, Sadoon sought Malaysia's help to end the

economic sanctions imposed on Iraq by the UN since 1991.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia has voiced its concern and dissatisfaction over the

sanctions imposed on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi leader said Malaysia's attitude was "very friendly

and positive" and the meetings were "very productive and

constructive".
</P>
<P>
He said that Malaysia is invited to participate in the

ambitious program of oil development in Iraq, which will be

carried out immediately after the embargo is lifted.
</P>
<P>
On Iraq's relationship with Iran, Sadoon said that "it is not

as good as we would expect to be."
</P>
<P>
Sadoon arrived here last Friday after his visit to Indonesia

and will leave for the Philippines on Wednesday to continue his

Southeast Asian tour.

four-day verification visit to a war-torn Liberia from today,

<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Experts have announced that

Chinese food benefits the health of children in China more

than western fast food, according to China Women's News.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that the past two years had seen the booming of

western-style fast food restaurants in major Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
A recent survey showed that most of the diners in the foreign

restaurants were children.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted experts at the China Institute of Nutrition

and Food Hygiene as saying that western-style fast food contains

too much protein, fat and heat.
</P>
<P>
People will become fatter when they eat too much fast food,

said the paper.
</P>
<P>
The number of cases of enteritis, stomach cancer and digestive

tract-related diseases is much higher in the United States than

that in China as a result of the lack of cellulose.
</P>
<P>
The paper advised that parents should encourage their children

to have more rice and beans, as well as vegetables rich in

cellulose, which greatly benefit the health of children.

<HEADLINE> Pakistani PM Urges Foreign Investment at Seminar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani caretaker Prime

Minister Malik Meraj Khalid said today that Pakistan is the only

South Asian country where foreign investors can own 100 percent

equity in any manufacturing of their choice.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at a seminar on "UK-Pakistan Investment

2000" held today in the eastern Pakistani city of Lahore.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, organized by the Board of Investment PAK-UK, was

inaugurated by visiting British Prime Minister John Major.
</P>
<P>
Meraj Khalid said that due to liberal economic policies,

Pakistan can safely claim to be one of the most liberal trading

partners and investors-friendly countries in the region.
</P>
<P>
Dividends and profits are freely repatriable for all the

foreign investors and all the restrictions have been lifted on

domestic borrowing by foreign-owned firms for fixed investment, he

said.
</P>
<P>
"No permission from the government or state bank is required by

companies for obtaining foreign loans for which government

guarantee is not sought," said the Pakistani prime minister.
</P>
<P>
He said that all restrictions on payment of royalties and

technical fee have been removed for investors while import

licensing system has also been abolished.
</P>
<P>
The tariff rates on imports have been substantially reduced, he

added.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan is a country of great economic potential and there are

considerable opportunities for joint ventures in various fields,

the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out the availability of highly skilled labor force

and cheap industrial raw materials are added factors for

competitive advantages for investment in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that due to its strategic location, Pakistan

serves as a gateway to the Central Asian Republics and has other

added advantage of access to the affluent Gulf states apart from

its own market of over 130 million people.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said that there has been highly encouraging

response from foreign investors to the economic reforms and

liberalized investment and trade regime in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
He said flow of foreign direct investment to the country has

increased from the level of 335 million dollars in 1991-92 to 1.1

billion in 1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani prime minister expressed the hope that the

seminar will further boost the economic cooperation between

Pakistan and Britain.

<HEADLINE> HK Toys Fair Tipped to Signal Bumper Year: Organizers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Asia's largest trade fair for

the toy industry, the 23rd Hong Kong Toys and Games Fair which

opened here today, is expected to predict a bumper year for the

industry worldwide.
</P>
<P>
This year's fair is the biggest and the best so far in its

23-year history, said Edmund Young, chairman of the Hong Kong

Trade Development Council's Toys Advisory Committee and chairman

of the Hong Kong Toys Council.
</P>
<P>
"For a trade fair of such a large scale and size to have

continued for 23 years is no easy or simple task, and its success

reflects the significance of the toys and games industry to the

local economy and Hong Kong's status as the world's top toy

exporter," Young said today.
</P>
<P>
The TDC official predicted that 1997 should be a better year

with a key factor being several toy-related movies due in the

United States. "These should provide the necessary excitement for

getting customers back into the stores," he said.
</P>
<P>
The four-day event in the Hong Kong Convention and Exhibition

Center grew in size from 23,500 square meters in 1996 to 24,000

square meters this year. The number of exhibitors also increased

from 930 to 960 and 23,000 buyers are expected to visit the fair.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has maintained its position as the world's leading

toy exporter for several years despite growing regional and

international competition. Total exports for the first 10 months

of 1996 showed an increase of five percent to 70.4 billion HK dollars

(9.02 billion U.S. dollars). In 1995, total exports amounted to

77.7 billion HK dollars (9.96 billion U.S. dollars), 12 percent

more than that of the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has earned a reputation for its wide range of high

quality toys, particularly plastic and electronic toys, with major

markets being the United States, Britain, Germany, Japan and

China.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Strikes Result in Over $2 billion Losses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Industrial production losses in

South Korea, caused by trade union strikes protesting the new

labor law over the past two weeks, have surpassed two billion

U.S. dollars, according to the Ministry of International Trade and

Industry today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the losses of the country's export climbed to 350

million dollars, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The strikes started on December 26 when South Korea's ruling

New Korea Party railroaded a labor law through the National

Assembly in the absence of opposition legislators.
</P>
<P>
The new labor law permits employers to lay off workers to

protect their firms from bankruptcy and to make workers to work at

any time within the boundary of 56 hours per week on a monthly

basis.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said that six of the 70 major companies in the

country have been affected by the strikes which see no definite

ending date. Hyundai Motor Company, which shut down all factories

on January 10, is one of the six.
</P>
<P>
Automakers suffered production and export losses of 1.7 billion

and 222 million U.S. dollars respectively, followed by the

machinery industry's 262 million and 30.7 million U.S. dollars, it

said.
</P>
<P>
The respective output and foreign shipment losses of

shipbuilders amounted to 68 million and 52 million dollars, and

those of steelmakers were 42 million and 2.3 million dollars, the

ministry added.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The following are business

briefs from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The merger of the Business Bank and the Jordan

National Bank, with a capital of 42 million Jordanian dinars

(about 59 million U.S. dollars) will create the fourth largest

commercial bank in Jordan, Jordan Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Business Bank General Manager Wasif Azar said that the main

reason behind the merger was that the Central Bank of Jordan

asked all commercial banks to raise their capital to 20 million

dinars (about 28 million dollars) if their total equity was less

than 15 million dinars (about 21 million dollars), in

preparation for Jordan's request to join the World Trade

Organization (WTO) and get into partnership with the European

Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
The new entity, to be known as Jordan National Bank, will be

the fourth largest bank in Jordan after the Arab Bank, the

Housing Bank and the Islamic Bank.
</P>
<P>
There are currently 15 commercial banks operating in

Jordan. In addition, there are four private investment banks, one

industrial development bank and several specialized credit

institutions.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- The Jordanian government intends to sell 26 percent

of equity in the state-owned Jordan Telecommunications Company

(JTC) to a "strategic partner" of international standing before

the end of this year, Post and Telecommunications Minister Jamal

Sarairah said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a weekly press briefing, Sarairah confirmed that

the JTC had accepted an offer from an international consortium to

act as financial advisor in the process.
</P>
<P>
The international consortium is led by the Merrill Lynch and

includes the local Export and Finance Bank of Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The Telecommunications Corporation (TCC) became privatized

from January 1 this year with its name changed into JTC and its

shares sold out to the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Although privatized, it is still "state-owned" as said by the

government. The TCC in 1993 registered a profit of around 143

million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The average output of Bahrain's oil refiner,

Bahrain Petroleum Company, stood at 260,000 barrels per day (bpd)

in 1996, compared with a previous peak of 259,700 bpd achieved in

1992, according to media reports.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the highest monthly average of the year

was recorded in May, when the plant produced 269,100 bpd of

various products.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of 1996, the refinery's output averaged

267,700 bpd.
</P>
<P>
The company's original designed capacity was 250,000 bpd.
</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The fifth Middle East Conference on Oil and Gas

will be held here from march 2 to 4, Abu Dhabi National Company

said in a latest report.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting will focus on the latest political and

economic developments in the Middle East and their impacts on oil

industry in the world.
</P>
<P>
A future vision for oil exploration and production,

petrochemical industry in the Middle East region, oil pricing and

its fluctuation, oil markets in Central Asia, Russia and Middle

East, and liquefied natural gas industrialization will also be

discussed during the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Some 45 experts are expected to address the conference which

will be participated by 200 senior officials from local, regional

and international oil, gas and energy companies.

<HEADLINE> Australia's Wine Industry Looking Robust </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Australian wine industry

is poised for a robust year in 1997, on the back of a strong

harvest and greater export opportunities, the Winemakers

Federation of Australia said.
</P>
<P>
Federation chief executive Ian Sutton said in a statement today

that it should prove a landmark year in terms of producing high

volumes of quality wine at a competitive price.
</P>
<P>
Previously the industry did not have the volume of fruit to

match domestic and export demand for premium brands. However, "the

outlook for this year really is exciting without overstating it",

Sutton said.
</P>
<P>
"We have got the fruit in the ground that's coming on stream,

and we have got the demand in the export market. And given an

average yield or good vintage in 1997, there's no reason why the

industry shouldn't forge ahead," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest wine sales figures, a total of 15.3

million liters of wine were exported in October, a 3.6 percent

increase over September, and domestic sales rose 5.1 percent over

the month earlier.
</P>
<P>
Under the federation's strategic plan released last year,

demand for Australian wine is envisaged to more than double from

1.3 to 3.0 billion Australian dollars (1.04 to 2.4 billion U.S.

dollars) by the year 2010 with exports increasing fourfold.
</P>
<P>
In its five-year outlook, the federation hopes to accelerate

Australia's penetration of international wine markets, including

the United Kingdom, Germany, Japan as well as Asian nations.

wreckage, Stephanie Ho, has regained consciousness but she is

still in a great shock, according to latest sources.
</P>
<P>
Rescuers are now trying hard to carry Stephanie Ho with

injuries on her head, from halfway up to atop the Maoer mountain,

so that ambulance would take her right to the hospital for prompt

treatment.

rescue operation. it has made successful contacts with local

hospitals, and ambulances were speeding the way to the Maoer

mountain to make sure that Ms. Ho would get timely treatment.

<HEADLINE> Iran Targets 18 Billion Dollars Oil Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian oil authorities has

targeted an oil export revenue of 18 billion U.S. dollars for the

new year as of March 21, 1997, despite the U.S. oil embargo on the

country, a local press report said today.
</P>
<P>
Oil Minister Gholamreza Aqazadeh said that Iran is expected to

export 2.5 million barrels of crude oil per day in the new

year. He estimated the Iranian oil price at 17.5 dollars per

barrel.
</P>
<P>
The English-language daily Iran News quoted the minister as

saying that the target of 18 billion dollar oil export revenue

represents an increase of 3.5 billion dollars over that of the

current Iranian year which ends March 20, 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, the oil minister said earlier that Iran would get 18

billion dollars from oil export during this Iranian year though

the pre-set target stands at 16 billion dollars in the budget.
</P>
<P>
Commenting the U.S. oil embargoes on Iran, which was imposed

last year, he claimed that the U.S. sanctions against Iran had

failed and that U.S. officials also had acknowledged this fact.
</P>
<P>
The d'Amato Law signed by U.S. President Bill Clinton last

August imposes sanctions against any foreign oil companies with

annual investment over 40 million U.S. dollars in Iran or Libya,

accusing the countries of supporting terrorism.
</P>
<P>
"Iran has many long-term agreements with foreign companies

and therefore we have been very successful in our endeavors," he

added.
</P>
<P>
In view of the fact that many of the non-member states of the

Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) are joining

the oil market daily, Aqazadeh said, "OPEC is an important

organization to establish oil prices and the absence of this

organization would create disorder in the world oil market."
</P>
<P>
"If OPEC saturates the market with its oil surplus, oil prices

would fall sharply. And therefore we expect all non-OPEC members

to recognize this fact and also realize that OPEC member states

will not continue their sacrifice indefinitely," he added.
</P>
<P>
Iran, the fourth largest oil producer and the second oil

exporter in the world, pumps about 3.6 million barrels of oil and

exports about 2.5 million barrels of oil per day.

<HEADLINE> UK-Pak Trade, Investment Has Bright Prospects: Major </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Visiting British Prime

Minister John Major said today the prospects of trading and

investment between the United Kingdom and Pakistan are very

bright.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a seminar "Pakistan Investment 2000" in Lahore, the

capital city of Punjab province, Major spoke highly of the

Pakistani government's move of continued liberalization and

deregularization which is leading to a free trade.
</P>
<P>
"There are still barriers in the European countries which are

to be lifted," he said.
</P>
<P>
Political stability is also clearly vital for domestic and

incoming investments in a country as trade and investment will

only flourish in the stable political background, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said the recent record of British investment in Pakistan is

impressive as the UK is poised to become Pakistan's leading

overseas investor.
</P>
<P>
In the past two years, British businessmen have invested more

in Pakistan than those from other countries have done, he noted.
</P>
<P>
"Thirty percent of the new foreign investments in Pakistan last

year were done by British investors," he said, adding that the

trade volume between the two countries had also gone up remarkably

since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said there is tremendous untapped potential in

the economic cooperation between the UK and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The UK-Pakistan commercial ties are clearly successful now and

will be far more essential and stronger in the future, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the British businessmen working in Pakistan shared

his views and recognize Pakistan as a high GDP growth country in

South Asia during the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
Leading a 20-member delegation including top British business

executives, Major arrived in Islamabad on Sunday on a three-day

official visit to Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Before coming to Pakistan, Major, who is on a three-nation

South Asia tour, visited India and Bangladesh.

<HEADLINE> China Construction Bank Making Efforts to Improve Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China Construction Bank (CCB)

benefited last year from some new management and administrative

strategies, giving it improved growth in both deposits and loans.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the bank's President Wang Qishan today at

the beginning of the bank's annual conference for the heads of its

provincial-level branches.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the bank began to establish a stronghold in major

cities and further centralized and reinforced the power of its

headquarters. It also set up large local branches by merging a

number of small ones on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
The bank expanded services for large state enterprises in major

industries. Nearly half of the bank's increase in new loans last

year went to these companies.
</P>
<P>
Major factors in 1996's achievements were an improvement of

internal controls to reduce loss and risk, the use of electronic

banking and information networks, and measures to improve the

quality of staff members, according to the president.
</P>
<P>
According to Wang, in 1996, CCB had 284.1 billion yuan in

deposits, bringing total deposits to 1.1 trillion yuan by the end

of the year, breaking the one trillion yuan mark for the first

time. The total of loans by year end was 825.5 billion yuan, an

increase of 129 billion yuan on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The bank also saw a 28 percent growth in its international

clearing business, which stood at 34.2 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
CCB's credit card business made great strides forward in 1996,

with more cards issued for the year than for all previous five

years together. The bank issued 5.5 million new cards, bringing

the total number to 10 million. The cards generated 200 billion

yuan in business, up 30 percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Wang pledged to continue the bank's strategies in 1997 and said

that the situation has become more challenging to his bank and

other state-owned commercial banks.
</P>
<P>
One headache is the large number of bad state enterprises still

causing more bad loans and hindering the development of the

country's banking sector, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chinese banks are also facing growing competition amongst

themselves, and foreign banks that have already entered China's

market also pose a new threat.

<HEADLINE> New Office To Deal with Major Corruption Cases in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China has set up a "special

case investigation section" (SCIS) to investigate more serious or

extreme cases of corruption this year.
</P>
<P>
The SCIS will target "extremely severe legal cases and

disciplinary offenses by officials at or above the department

level in central government offices and those at or above the

vice-governor level in local areas," an official with the Supreme

People's Procuratorate said in Beijing today.
</P>
<P>
The SCIS is part of the Law and Discipline Department of the

Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
"This has been a major step by the Procuratorate to make a

breakthrough in solving cases of neglect of duty by state

employees, or violations of citizens' rights, abuse of power, and

other major crimes," the Procuratorate official said.
</P>
<P>
The SCIS is now busy organizing a 50-member special

investigation group, and will start work as soon as possible, he

said.
</P>
<P>
The SCIS is also responsible for guiding or coordinating

anti-corruption groups in provincial procuratorates in

investigating major corruption cases in local areas and cases

involving different areas, according to the official.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's relations with Vatican

can be normalized only on the condition of Vatican's severance of

its so-called diplomatic ties with Taiwan and non-interference in

China's religious affairs.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman Shen Guofang made the

statement at a routine press conference here this afternoon, when

he was asked to comment on the relations between China and Vatican.
</P>
<P>
The recent overseas visits of some Taiwanese officials in the

name of 'vacationing' and 'stopover' and receiving honorary

titles, Shen noted, are aimed to create internationally 'two

Chinas' or 'one China, one Taiwan,' and to undermine China's

friendly ties with the countries concerned.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said he hopes that the countries concerned should

be alert and do not make the Taiwan issue an obstacle to the

development of their relations with China.

<HEADLINE> Drinking Water Better for Southwest Chinese Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Kunming, the capital of China's

Yunnan Province, has started a drinking water project that will

give its residents higher quality water.
</P>
<P>
According to the city government, it plans to spend 200 million

yuan (24.1 million US dollars) on providing 50 million cubic

meters of high quality water for the city every year.
</P>
<P>
The city's daily water use is about 0.5 million cubic meters,

far greater than its supply of about 0.3 million cubic meters. As

a result, some residents have to drink heavily-polluted water from

Dianchi Lake, according to "China Environmental News".
</P>
<P>
The 300 sq km Dianchi Lake, a famous tourist attraction, is the

main source of water for Kunming's industry, agriculture, and

residents, but it has been seriously polluted for years due to

long term neglect.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 800,000 residents will no longer need to use water from

Dianchi in two years time, according to an official in charge of

the project.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asian Carmakers: Potential Rivals of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Asian auto industry is

developing at a fast pace, and within years, Asian carmakers could

become major rivals of their western counterparts, experts

predicted.
</P>
<P>
With its economy developing as the world's fastest, Asia's auto

industry has been making remarkable progress since the beginning

of the 1990s'. Japan, whose auto export for 1996 is predicted at

3.73 million units, has already been a major rival of western

automakers for many years. But now, other Asian countries, such as

South Korea and Malaysia, are also regarded as potential rivals of

their western counterparts within years.
</P>
<P>
South Korea, which is expected to produce over 3 million

vehicles by 2000, could become the fifth largest auto producing

nation in the world in the next few years, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
According to a report published recently by the Economist

Intelligence Unit, South Korea will dominate the auto industry in

Asia over the next decade, with annual car and truck production

reaching 3.5 million in 2005, nearly one third of the region's

total.
</P>
<P>
"By 2000, three South Korean firms aim to be among the top 10

in the world -- Hyundai, Daewoo, Kia Motors Corp., while Samsung

co, the latest entrant, plans to join them by 2010," the report

said.
</P>
<P>
The development of the auto industry in Malaysia is also

eye-catching. Though started as late as in 1985, Malaysia's auto

industry, stimulated by the fast growth of its economy, has

developed steadily with output increasing by over 40 percent in

the last decade. As a major auto producing center in Southeast

Asia, Malaysia's annual auto output could reach 620,000 units by

the end of the century and it would become a major car-making

center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
In addition to South Korea and Malaysia, China, India,

Thailand, Indonesia and the Philippines have also speed up the

development of their auto industry.
</P>
<P>
With the emergence of South Korea, Malaysia and other Asian

countries as potential major car producers in the region or even

in the world, fierce competition between Asian automakers and

their western counterparts for the Asian market is almost certain

in the near future, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
However, the immediate threat to carmakers in the west is not

the competition for the Asian markets, but the massive

overcapacity among Asian carmakers. The overcapacity could

threaten weaker European firms like France's Renault and Peugeot,

and Italy's Fiat, the Economist Intelligence Unit report said.
</P>
<P>
By 2000 total capacity for car, commercial vehicles and trucks

in the Asia-Pacific region will be around 13.8 million a year,

with local sales expected to reach only 7.5 percent, it said.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the excess capacity would be aimed at

markets in North America and Europe, and "weaker competitors like

Renault and Peugeot and Fiat are likely to suffer from an export

drive from Asia," as they are all based in high cost countries by

world standards and in low growth markets, and they are

over-dependent on sales in their home countries.
</P>
<P>
But the poorer quality of Asian cars is unlikely to threaten

North American markets, it added.
</P>
<P>
Another threat to European carmakers is a coming electronics

revolution in the auto industry by Japanese, South Korean and U.S.

manufacturers. According to car experts, in the next decade,

computer power will gradually take more of the risk out of

driving, and may also be able to protect the ultimate innocents in

traffic accidents, the pedestrian.
</P>
<P>
They said that the use of electronics could increase power by

up 50 percent and improve fuel consumption by 25 percent while

harmful emissions could be cut by between 40 and 90 percent.
</P>
<P>
As Japanese and South Korean carmakers have electronics

subsidiaries or affiliates, they will be better placed than the

Europeans.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that South Korean carmakers, particularly Daewoo,

Hyundai and Samsung, which will start building cars in 1998, will

benefit from being part of a large group which includes a dominant

electronics company.
</P>
<P>
However, while Asian carmakers are competing with their western

counterparts, luxury cars made by European and American companies

continued to enjoy a strong market in Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
Successful entrepreneurs and professionals in the region prefer

luxury cars, because they are "more reliable, comfortable and

safer" as the buyers said.
</P>
<P>
The luxury sector in Asia principally comprises vehicles from

Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Jaguar, Volvo and Toyota, with a sprinkling of

Audi cars in some markets. At present, Mercedes-Benz dominates in

virtually every country, but BMW and Jaguar are posing strong

challenges in some of the more developed markets in the region.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, with the improvement of their car quality, Asian

carmakers could gradually share the market of luxury cars in the

future, analysts said.

LUSAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President F. Chiluba

has appointed a three-man tribunal to investigate Lusaka High

Court judge Kabazo Chanda who has been suspended with immediate

effect, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal is headed by the Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC)

commissioner justice Robert Kapembwa. The other two in the

tribunal are Supreme Court judge justice Brian Gardner and

Malawian Supreme Court of Appeal judge justice Leonard Unyolo.
</P>
<P>
The reasons for the move are not given so far. But last week,

justice Chanda released 53 remandees from prison for allegedly

overstaying behind bars without trial, some of whom were not

appearing before him charged with serious offenses of aggravated

robbery. Some of the pardoned suspects are reportedly behind many

violent crimes now being committed around Lusaka.
</P>
<P>
A judge can be removed for inability, incompetence or

misbehaviour.
</P>
<P>
According to the Zambian Constitution, the president is

empowered to appoint a tribunal which ''shall inquire into the

matter and report on the facts to the president and advise the

president whether the judge ought to be removed from office ''.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Overseas Direct Investment Keeps Falling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's overseas direct

investment in November 1996 fell for the third consecutive month

due to persistent business slowdown at home, the Bank of Korea

said today.
</P>
<P>
The central bank said November overseas direct investment by

South Korean firms came to 334 million U.S. dollars on an approval

basis, down 26.3 percent from the 453 million dollars approved in

October.
</P>
<P>
The November figure also represented a 23.6-percent fall from

the 437 million dollars in the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
South Korea's overseas direct investment reached a peak in

August last year with 591 million dollars, and then plunged to 485

million dollars in September.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the slowdown to tighter corporate financial

conditions after the country's economic downswing.
</P>
<P>
During the first 11 months of 1996, South Korea's approved

overseas direct investment totaled 4.96 billion U.S. dollars, up

25 percent from the same period of the previous year, the bank

added.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe Expects Bumper Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe is expecting a bumper

harvest this year with more than 10 percent record hike of most

crops' yield, as the present rains continue, the daily Herald

reported today.
</P>
<P>
Agriculture Minister Denis Norman predicted in an interview

with Herald Monday that tobacco production will go up from 1996's

200 million kilograms to 240 million this year.
</P>
<P>
Maize output will rise from 2.6 million tons to about three

million tons this year and cotton seed from 270,000 kilograms

to more than 300,000 kilograms, Norman said.
</P>
<P>
"The rainfall has been very good and fairly wide spread and

the crops are looking very encouraging. Grazing is good and water

supplies are building up very nicely," he said.
</P>
<P>
Norman said he hopes that with the improved grazing, farmers

will be encouraged to retain their breeding stock, and thus

continue to rebuild the national herd, which was depleted as a

result of the devastating drought of 1991/92.
</P>
<P>
Norman claimed earlier that the agricultural industry in the

southern African country has become a major foreign exchange

earner, making for 40 to 50 percent of the national exports.
</P>
<P>
Farming is a main source for 70 percent of Zimbabweans to live

on and it has provided jobs for 25 percent of the total labour

force in the country.

<HEADLINE> Urban Children Do Farm Work in Nanjing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Great Outdoors is providing

a classroom with a difference for thousands of city schoolchildren

in China.
</P>
<P>
From their urban schools in places such as Shanghai and

Nanjing, over 10,000 pupils have headed to the countryside for

lessons in rural life.
</P>
<P>
And they even have to wash their own clothes - something few

would do in their wealthy homes in the big cities.
</P>
<P>
The pupils have to interview farmer families, plant a hectare

of farmland with nursery stock and flowers, and do scientific

research in a national park.
</P>
<P>
The pupil's farm, located in Jiangpu County of Nanjing,

Jiangsu's capital city, was set up in 1994 by Nanjing Xingzhi

Primary School.
</P>
<P>
By investing 650,000 yuan (78,400 US dollars), the Nanjing

Municipal Education Commission, and a fund for the pupils'

scientific and technological activities, co-sponsored the project

in a bid to teach pupils more practical knowledge, especially

about farm produce and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The Xingzhi agricultural scientific and technological base for

pupils has an area of farmland as well as a pupil's dining

hall. So far it has provided accommodation for about 10,000 pupils

from Nanjing, Shanghai and other cities.
</P>
<P>
The base, named after Tao Xingzhi, a late well-known Chinese

educationist who advocated the combination of education with

practice, is also a regular camp for more than ten schools,

including the reputed Jingling Middle School in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
"We are able to accept 100 pupils every session," Yang Ruiqing,

headmaster of Xingzhi Primary School, said.
</P>
<P>
"They are required to practice agriculture and even wash

clothes themselves," he added.
</P>
<P>
The one-child policy, adopted by the Chinese government in the

late 1970s, has created three-member nuclear families in China,

particularly in cities and townships. Many urban children never do

household chores, let alone work on farmland.
</P>
<P>
"One of our purposes for building the base," Cao Wan,

vice-director of the working commission of caring for the young

generation, said, "is to let urban children care about rural areas

and farmers."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Philippines Pushes Development of Tourism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines has pushed the

development of its tourism industry during the past few years.

However, the country still has a long way to go before becoming a

most popular destination in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Tourism Secretary Mina Gabor recently reported to President

Fidel Ramos that, for the first time, annual tourist arrivals in

the country broke a two-million record last year, posting the

highest growth rate of 16.6 percent in the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"We expect to generate something like 2.7 billion U.S. dollars

out of the 2.05 million arrivals, which will represent 5.23

percent of the gross domestic product (GDP) of the country," she

said.
</P>
<P>
Gabor said that tourism has become one of the country's

important earners of foreign exchange. Its income ranked second

only to the remittances from overseas Filipino contract workers,

which totaled 7 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
She added statistics from the World Tourism Organization (WTO)

also showed that the country ranked the highest in tourism

receipts per tourist arrival, with visitors spending some 1,653

dollars per visit as compared to Europe and the United States

which recorded an average of only 708 dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industry also helped ease up the high unemployment pressure

of the country by creating some 1.11 million jobs last year, an

increase of 28 percent over 1995, she said.
</P>
<P>
Actually, tourism in the Philippines has enjoyed consistent

growth in the last four years, in terms of both tourist arrival

and revenue. Gabor attributed this positive trend to political

stability, economic growth and social progress the country has

achieved as well as the marketing and promotional programs

launched by her department in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
However, she was also aware that it was easier for the country

to attain the highest growth rate than other countries, because it

has a low starting point. Before Ramos was sworn into office in

1992, years of political turmoil and high crime rate had resulted

in the stagnant development of the country's tourism.
</P>
<P>
Although the Philippines stepped up last year to the 12th

position in the standings of most visited countries and regions in

Asia, it was still far behind Hong Kong, Malaysia and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
To face up to the challenge, the Philippines decided to push

harder the development of its tourism.
</P>
<P>
Before the end of last year, the Department of Tourism

intensified its campaign to encourage more banks to extend loans

to entrepreneurs involved in tourism-related projects. Until now,

various banks in the country have pledged about 2.5 billion pesos

(95 million dollars) for the infrastructure development of the

industry.
</P>
<P>
Political stability and economic growth have also set a

favorable climate for foreign investors. The Lotus Hotels and

Resorts from the United States and the Australia-based Kemayan

Hotels and Leisure Ltd. are putting the Philippines as their entry

point in Asia. The World Bank also pledged to provide assistance

to tourism infrastructure in the country, the first time in 20

years.
</P>
<P>
While attracting more investments into the industry, the

country also doubled its effort in tourism infrastructure. It

upgraded five airports in Clark, Subic, Davao, Laoag and Cebu into

international ones last year. This year, it has identified 27

priority destinations and tourist attractions nationwide as

"flagship projects" of the government.
</P>
<P>
To lure more visitors to the country known for white beaches

and deep waters, the Philippines launched a series of tours with

its own characteristics, including adventure tours such as cave

exploring, whale or bird watching and diving, as well as theme

tours like "the Islands Philippines", "Visit the Best of the

Islands Philippines" and "Bring Home a Friend".
</P>
<P>
Last year, the hosting of the Asian Pacific Economic

Cooperation forum brought more than 10,000 visitors to the

country. To keep the momentum, the country recently came up with

the "Convention City of Manila" campaign to revive Manila's image

as a famous convention and exhibition city.
</P>
<P>
So far the Philippines has succeeded in bidding for seven

international events which include the World Media Summit, the

World Police Forum, the World Congress on Higher Education, the

World Children's Summit and the World Tourism Leaders' Meeting.
</P>
<P>
Gabor said her department is also concentrating on a "roots

program" to attract tourists from North America, particularly the

young people of Filipino descent, to visit the country and

familiarize themselves with their parents' culture and tradition.
</P>
<P>
The secretary predicted that the tourist industry will continue

its vigorous growth this year. She said the Philippines was

targeting 2.32 million tourists arrivals with an estimated income

of 3.2 billion dollars and 1.3 million new jobs.

Institute in Shandong Province in east China can turn 70 percent

of the processed pigskin into high-grade leather, which is useful

for garments, furniture, suitcases, and handbags.
</P>
<P>
China processes 70 million hides annually, accounting for 70

percent of the country's total animal hide output. But the

leather-making industry has long been plagued by problems of poor

economic performance.
</P>
<P>
So, China began looking for new technology in 1986 and began

using its developments in 1990. Now 86 large and medium-sized

leather-making firms in 18 provinces have adopted the technology,

bringing them tremendous benefits.

<HEADLINE> Israelis, Palestinians to Continue Hebron Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 14 (Xinhua) -- As Israeli and Palestinian

negotiators are due resume talks today on the long-awaited

Israeli army redeployment in Hebron, U.S. mediators are once again

talking about leaving here without an agreement.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio quoted a senior US official as saying that

U.S. special Middle East coordinator Dennis Ross is seriously

considering returning to Washington today if an agreement on

Hebron is not reached.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, Ross was almost on his way back to the United

States, but decided to stay at the last minute after Jordanian

King Hussein's dramatic visit to Gaza and Tel Aviv to save the

negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Hussein reportedly secured a key Palestinian concession that

appears to have brought the sides much closer to a Hebron

agreement during his meeting with Palestinian National Authority

President Yasser Arafat Sunday in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
A senior Palestinian official said that Arafat agreed to

Hussein's proposal that Israel could prolong its three-stage

withdrawal from West Bank rural areas, narrowing the gap on the

key sticking point in the talks.
</P>
<P>
During previous talks, Arafat has wanted all pullbacks to

conclude by September, 1997, as called for in the Oslo II

accords, while Netanyahu's proposal was for a third pullback by

the end of the interim period, ending in the spring of 1999, so it

would overlap with the deadline for resolving final status issues.
</P>
<P>
Hussein initiated a compromise proposal on a critical future

Israeli army pullback from the West Bank in the middle of

1998.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the expectations that the Hebron deal would

finally be concluded Monday, it appears that negotiators will

have to hold, at least, another round of talks before the

accord will eventually be closed.
</P>
<P>
On Monday night, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai

suggested that the U.S. should announce a time for the initialing

ceremony this afternoon, hoping the announcement of a deadline

would end what he believed to be Palestinian stalling.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu has said

that it could be that an agreement with the Palestinians was

imminent, but he has "a lot of patience."
</P>
<P>
Both Netanyahu and Mordechai estimated the Hebron agreement

would be initialed today, while Palestinian officials were less

certain, but said agreement was close.
</P>
<P>
There were indications that both Israelis and Palestinians

were reopening unspecified and perhaps minor parts of the

accord during Monday's intensive talks to draft the Hebron

accord.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian negotiators claimed that Israel was trying to

change nine clauses which had already agreed upon during

previous talks, while Israeli officials denied the charge,

saying it was the Palestinian side that had raised new

demands.
</P>
<P>
Israeli media reported that the dates of three post-Hebron

Israeli pullbacks from the West Bank are likely to be put forward

in separate U.S. "letters of assurance" to Israelis and the

Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
As it stands now, the letters will be handed by the U.S.

to each side, but it is unclear whether each side will be

informed what is in the other's letter, nor whether the

letters will be made public along side the official Hebron

accord.
</P>
<P>
The last time the U.S. drafted letters of assurance to

Israelis and Palestinians was on the eve of the 1991 Madrid peace

conference, and those letters have never been disclosed, but

assumed to be an enunciation of U.S. Middle East policy.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Agricultural Targets For 1997 (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China will keep the amount of

land sown in cereals crops at no less than 110.7 million ha. and

try to keep grain output at or above 480 billion kg this year.
</P>
<P>
These are two of the major tasks agreed upon at a four-day

Central Rural Work Conference organized by the Central Committee

of the Communist Party of China (CPC) in Beijing, which ended here

Monday.
</P>
<P>
Top leaders Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, and Zhu Rongji, who spoke at

the conference, called for the whole nation to work with redoubled

efforts and guarantee achieving all-round economic and social

development in rural areas of the country.
</P>
<P>
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun also made a speech on "Correctly

analysing the present situation, unifying people's thinking, and

striving for sustained, stable agricultural growth this year."
</P>
<P>
Agricultural and rural economic development in 1996 were better

than expected, and marked a good start for the country's Ninth

Five-Year Plan (1996-2000), according to those present at the

conference.
</P>
<P>
In spite of some relatively grave natural disasters, grain

output set a record after the a fairly remarkable rise in

1995. The annual per-capita income of farmers was up some six

percent, while rural areas had social stability, and township and

village-run enterprises recorded sustained growth.
</P>
<P>
Nonetheless, it was pointed out, the foundation of agriculture

is still a weak sector which is poorly equipped, vulnerable to

natural disasters, inefficient, and has a negative growth

pattern. New situations and new problems cropped up after the good

harvest, so growth of rural productivity should not be

over-estimated.
</P>
<P>
In outlining major tasks for agricultural and rural economic

development, those at the conference held that increased efforts

should be made in strengthening the status of agriculture as the

foundation, in economic structural reforms in rural areas, in

improving capital construction on farmland, in effectively

alleviating the burdens on farmers, in ensuring increased crop

output, and in having more net income for farmers, as well as

all-round economic growth and social development in rural China.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea Ranks Sixth in World Steel Production </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 14 (Xinhua) -- South Korea remained the world's

sixth largest iron and steel producer in 1996, dashing an earlier

hope to emerge as the fifth by moving ahead of Germany, the Korea

Steel Manufacturers Association (KSMA) said today.
</P>
<P>
The country produced 35.53 million tons of iron and steel in

the first 11 months last year, which was about one million tons

less than the 36.5 million tons produced by Germany during the

same period, said a report released by the KSMA.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter of 1996, South Korean steelmakers,

led by the Pohang Iron and Steel Company, produced 9.78 million

tons, exceeding the 9.72 million tons in Germany.
</P>
<P>
South Korea maintained the upper hand through the first half of

the year, but increased production in Germany in the second half

held South Korea at bay, the KSMA said.
</P>
<P>
Other countries producing more iron and steel than South Korea

are China, Japan, the United States and Russia, the KSMA added.

HARARE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 90,000 drought-weary

villagers in Beitbridge District of south Zimbabwe are on the

brink of another food crisis, the daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the district of some 100,000 people, mounting hunger has

emerged as reserves in silos are dwindling rapidly owing to

insufficient inflows.
</P>
<P>
Both the government and aid workers in the district last week

warned of an impending crisis unless the government moved with

speed to replenish food reserves in the Matabeleland South

District.
</P>
<P>
Acting District Administrator Orthaniel Dube is concerned that

fresh food for the grain loan scheme and the free drought relief

program for the disabled, the elderly and the feeble had not been

delivered to the district despite repeated appeals from the

hungry.
</P>
<P>
While expressing his hope that the situation will improve

because of continued rainfall in neighbouring districts, Dube

said the problem at hand can only be solved by an immediate

resuscitation of the grain loan scheme.

<HEADLINE> China's Major Agricultural Targets For 1997 (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
To reach this year's goals, the following tasks need to be

accomplished. The Party and government at all levels should place

agriculture ahead of all other economic work and intensify efforts

at developing agriculture.
</P>
<P>
They should be firm in increasing input in agriculture, and in

implementing agriculture-support policies and measures,

encouraging other sectors to support agriculture, and be firm in

improving agriculture conditions and reducing farmers' burdens to

ensure sustained agricultural and rural development.
</P>
<P>
It is imperative that a good job be done in grain purchasing

and in dealing with problems existing in farm produce

distribution. An effort should be made to ensure success with

grain distribution reforms.
</P>
<P>
The use of science and education for agricultural development

must also be accelerated and an effort made to spread the

application of advanced agricultural techniques to make the year

an "agricultural year for spreading scientific and technological

programs."
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the rural industrial structure must be

adjusted and improved to succeed in increasing output and income.
</P>
<P>
Different areas should consider their own situations and adapt

to market demands, making use of resource advantages in their

respective regions, and find new growth outlets and new ways of

increasing output and income.
</P>
<P>
An effort should also be made to increase construction of water

conservation facilities to increase the capability of farmland to

combat natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
One of this year's tasks is ensuring that major river and

reservoirs do not get out of their banks during flood season. An

effort must be made to combat natural disasters that may have a

great effect on agriculture, with a determination to succeed at

overcoming natural adversities and keeping economic losses to an

absolute minimum. Different areas should also improve

water-control facility construction to be prepared for any

possible major flooding.
</P>
<P>
An effort should be made to continue the rural reforms and give

vitality to agriculture and rural economy, and to make certain

that the Party's rural work policies are effective.
</P>
<P>
Anywhere the first round of land contracts have expired, a good

job should be done in extending the land contracts on time in

accordance with Central Government regulations, and that those

land contracts which have been given extended terms remain

unchanged for a long time to come.
</P>
<P>
Different locations are also urged to make a greater effort to

ease farmers' burdens and to protect farmers' rights, and to see

to cultural and ethical progress in rural areas, with the purpose

of promoting overall development of society.
</P>
<P>
The four-day meeting was attended by Party and government

officials responsible for agriculture and rural work in provinces,

autonomous regions and municipalities, and cities with independent

status, and by the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, as

well as ranking officials of the central government departments.

<HEADLINE> 1996 Creates Better Life For Shanghai Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- To the 3.3 million families of

Shanghai, China's leading manufacturing center, 1996 was a year

full of modern conveniences and a lot of shopping activities.
</P>
<P>
On new year's day, Qu Fenying, a worker, spent a lot of time

calling on relatives and friends on her newly-installed

telephone. Qu was not alone in her enjoyment of the new

convenience: statistics show that a record 700,000 telephone

numbers were issued in 1996, and the number of residential

telephone users last year reached 1.85 million, representing half

of all Shanghai households.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 950 Shanghai homes relinquished their old-style brick

stoves for gas cookers, which were introduced in the city in

1865. By 1989, 1.32 million Shanghai families had switched to the

use of gas cookers, and from 1990 to 1996, another 1.75 million

followed.
</P>
<P>
The electric power department of Shanghai installed 700,000

power meters in homes in 1996. Currently, two million households

in Shanghai use hourly meters, up from only several thousand in

1985.
</P>
<P>
1996 was also a great year for shopping for hundreds of

thousands of Shanghain citizens. A new survey lists purchase

totals of 500,000 air conditioners, 200,000 color TV sets, 130,000

water heaters, 120,000 refrigerators, 100,000 washing machines,

50,000 sets of hi-fi equipment, 50,000 video recorders, 40,000

cameras, and 650 million yuan (over 78 million U.S. dollars) worth

of gold, silver and jewel articles.

And on Xianmianci Lane in the downtown area, a new red fire

extinguisher is proudly displayed in the home of Yuan A'mao, who

says he now feels safer living in the wooden structure.

<HEADLINE> India Likely to Accord Deemed Export Status for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- India has reportedly decided

to accord deemed export status to equipment manufacturers in the

power and petroleum sectors, the Finance Ministry sources said

here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that Finance Minister P. Chidambaram had taken

a special initiative for meeting this long-standing demand of the

industries.
</P>
<P>
They said that the finance minister reportedly told the

equipment manufacturers that deemed export status would be granted

to them in case their demand was duly endorsed by concerned

authorities in the ministries of power and petroleum and natural

gas.
</P>
<P>
The deemed export status entitles these equipment manufacturers

to certain excise reimbursement by the government, which they pay

to the excise department at the time when their products come out

of factories.
</P>
<P>
The equipment manufacturers had been raising this demand

through apex chambers for some time. Industry chambers argued that

the deemed export status would give a competitive edge to

indigenous equipment manufacturers on the international market.

<P>
NAIROBI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Foreign Minister

Kalonzo Musyoka has called for the change of the veto system in

the U.N. Security Council and the introduction of a more

democratic veto system in the U.N. organ.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan minister made the call yesterday after receiving a

Hindu religious delegation led by Rajendra Singh. He said that

the U.N. veto power had been used against the interests of the

third world nations and this undemocratic veto system needs to be

reviewed in line with the world's process of democratization.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is a concensus among the third world

representatives that the veto system should be reviewed in order

to introduce a more democratic system of electing the

secretary-general.
</P>
<P>
Musyoka maintained that Africa should have two permanent seats

in the U.N. Security Council. There has been serious lobbying

among African representatives at the U.N. headquarters for the

awarding of at least two seats, he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- An outstanding pilot unit

in China's reform of state enterprises, the Handan Iron and Steel

Complex in north China's Hebei province, reported 700 million yuan

(84.3 million US dollars) in profits in 1996, ranking third among

the country's iron and steel giants.
</P>
<P>
The once little-known complex, which now has 28,000 employees

with an annual sales volume of five billion yuan, is capable of

producing two million tons of iron, steel and rolled steel a year.
</P>
<P>
Six years ago the loss-making enterprise produced less than one

million tons of iron and steel a year, but it successfully

overcame its difficulties that were caused by rising production

costs and a sluggish market, by upgrading technology, improving

management, and increasing efficiency. Now even an ordinary worker

sees his responsibility to reduce costs.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the central government issued a circular calling on

other state enterprises to study and follow the complex's

experience.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hanzhang, general manager of the complex, says that because

the complex is now cited for other state enterprises to follow, he

feels that his plant should do still better.

<HEADLINE> East Chinese Province's High-Tech Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Zhejiang Province has a new

high-tech development scheme to help increase its high-tech

industrial output value to 100 billion yuan (12 billion

U.S. dollars) by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
The "New Century Project" will concentrate on three new

high-tech industrial development zones in Hangzhou, Ningbo and

Wenzhou cities.
</P>
<P>
By the year 2000, the province hopes to add 500 high-tech

enterprises with this new scheme, including 20 enterprises groups

each capable of one billion yuan in output value yearly and 80

enterprises capable of 100 million yuan in output value.
</P>
<P>
Local officials say the high-tech development scheme is

actually similar to China's "Torch Program" whose purpose is to

promote development of new- and high-tech industries.
</P>
<P>
The "Torch Program" started in 1988 and now focuses on

microelectronics, computers, information science, lasers, new

materials, bioengineering, new energy, and energy-efficient

machine-electronics, integrating technology and products.
</P>
<P>
The province has had 471 national and provincial "Torch

Program" projects. High-tech industrial enterprises in the

province generate 50 billion yuan in output value a year.
</P>
<P>
The Hangzhou New- and High-Tech Industrial Development Zone, a

state-level high-tech zone established in 1991, is now home to 410

enterprises, including 231 high-tech businesses. Last year, it

generated five billion yuan in industrial output value.

<HEADLINE> Bus Decorations, an Attraction to Dalian Visitors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Buses in northeast China's port

city of Dalian, bedecked with colorful pictures and painted

messages, are not only a new attraction to visitors, but have

helped local residents to promote good behavior and model conduct.
</P>
<P>
"To show respect to senior citizens means not only a family

reunion during festival, but your utmost care in their daily

lives," reads one message emblazoned across a Route 2 bus.
</P>
<P>
Pictures of new city sights, composed of mushrooming highrises

amid an abundance of lawns and trees, are carried by the buses to

every corner of the booming city.
</P>
<P>
"The pictures added a bright color to our busy life. It's

really nice," said Office Worker Zheng at the Dalian Personnel

Management Bureau.
</P>
<P>
One-color buses, some of them even looking dirty, are a common

scene in many of China's streets. Buses painted with colorful

pictures are still rare, even though the fast-growing commercial

economy has driven businesses to commodity advertisings on

more and more urban buses.
</P>
<P>
Over the past few years the Chinese government has advanced a

national drive aiming at promoting cultural and ethical progress

among the people.
</P>
<P>
Mass media, billboards erected along streets, and posters, have

all played a key role in reminding people to be more socialist

minded and culturally developed.
</P>
<P>
However, the bus is still a new innovation when it comes to

taking the messages, literally, onto the streets.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, the Dalian city government decided to use its

buses as carriers of messages. It was felt that colorful buses

would not only add some artistic touches to the city's bustling

streets, but ask and guide people to perform outstanding deeds.
</P>
<P>
"It's an ideal means to convey such messages," said news

reporter Yan Ping, who explained that the bus is means of getting

around for Dalian residents, transporting about three million

urbanites daily.
</P>
<P>
Since 1995, the city government has invested more than 100

million yuan (12 million US dollars) to renew and paint some 2,000

buses.
</P>
<P>
Dalian is famous in China for its great enthusiasm for sport,

especially football. Pictures on buses include portraits of Gold

Medalist Wang Junxia, a Dalian girl winning the 5,000-meter-race

at the Atlanta Olympic Games last summer, and members of Dalian

Wanda football team, the national professional football champions

of last year.
</P>
<P>
"We're proud of them, and we can see them daily," said Zhao

Hua, a bus passenger. "That can somehow encourage us to do our own

jobs better still."

<HEADLINE> Movement Of Transient Labor Under Control In Southern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Nine southern Chinese

provinces have enhanced cooperation to keep the orderly movement

of transient laborers in and out.
</P>
<P>
The move came in response to the invasion of numerous farm

workers from inland areas into the booming Pearl River Delta in

Guangdong Province in the early 1990s, causing social and economic

disarray that grew out of control.
</P>
<P>
In early 1992, Guangdong, Hunan, and Sichuan provinces and the

Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region set up a cooperative mechanism

for better labor-shifting control, and were later joined by the

five provinces of Hubei, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Henan, and Anhui.
</P>
<P>
With the aid of the Ministry of Labor, a computerized labor

information network for southern China was put to use in early

1995, allowing labor departments in the areas to inform each other

about labor flow tendencies, and to work together to help relocate

and manage transient laborers, ensuring that laborers' interests

are also protected.
</P>
<P>
Laborers are required to fill in forms at local labor

departments if they want to look for work outside their hometown,

and labor departments in areas laborers migrate to also require

them to complete employment forms.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics, by last May more than 60 percent of

the workers in Guangdong Province had filled in forms both from

labor departments in their hometowns and in the areas where they

were working.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Has No Capacity to Build Big Arms Industry: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Defense Minister

Syed Hamid Albar said today Malaysia has no capacity to develop a

military weapons industry.
</P>
<P>
"We are a small nation. We want self-reliance (in weapons) but

we never imagine ourselves as a big power," he said when asked to

comment on a foreign magazine report of military industrialization

in Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
The "Bulletin of Atomic Scientists", a United States-based

magazine, carried a report in its latest issue released last week,

which described Malaysia as one of "East Asia's Big Eight"

countries devoting "lavish resources" to developing their military

industries.
</P>
<P>
Describing the report as "inaccurate," Syed Hamid said Malaysia

would like to collaborate with western and east European countries

that have military technologies.
</P>
<P>
"Malaysia is not trying to compete to become a super military

producer....we will be in no position and capacity to do that," he

said after meeting Kuwait's navy chief Ahmad Yousif Al-Mulla here.
</P>
<P>
He said the visit by Ahmad was intended to enhance cooperation

and military training between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad, who arrived yesterday for a six-day visit, was trained

in Malaysia in 1979 and wanted to visit his friends in the

Malaysian navy, Syed Hamid said.
</P>
<P>
He said they discussed the possibility of having joint training

by the navies of the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Ahmad earlier called on Chief of Armed Forces General Ismail

Omar and Chief of Navy Ahmad Ramli Mohd Noor.

WELLINGTON, January 14 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand's wool prices

sank to a four-year low at the country's first wool sale this

year.
</P>
<P>
Wools of New Zealand, formerly known as the NZ Wool Board, said

in its latest Wool Market Review available today that wool market

indicator fell by 20 percent at the first sale on January 9 this

year compared with the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
The present level of 421 NZ cents a kilogram (295 US cents) is

the lowest in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
The review blamed the high NZ dollar for causing the fall. It

said the dollar on January 9 was 9 percent higher in value than

the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
It also cited a lack of recent demand from China, which is NZ's

major wool buyer, as another major factor causing the prices to

fall.

<HEADLINE> China's Third Largest Lake Bed Is Dry Land 1,700 Years Ago </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- New evidence indicates that

China's third largest freshwater lake, Taihu in Jiangsu Province,

was dry land 1,700 years ago.
</P>
<P>
An ancient well uncovered recently in a part of this

2,420-sq.km. lake points to the fact that it was still dry land

200 years later than archeologists have believed.
</P>
<P>
The well site became dry ground after an embankment building

project was started to turn part of the lake into arable land in

the 1970s. The lake's average depth is 2 meters.
</P>
<P>
When Yinhu village in nearby Wuxi city started to build a new

village, the well was discovered.
</P>
<P>
The brick-walled well, which is 4 meters deep and one meter in

diameter, was covered by a meter of earth. A dozen china pots were

found in the well.
</P>
<P>
According to experts at the Wuxi Museum, the pots were made in

Yixing during the Xiji period, approximately 1,700 years ago.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian, U.S. Firms Sign Six Accords on Multimedia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian companies today

signed six agreements and two memoranda of understanding with

their American partners to collaborate in multimedia projects.
</P>
<P>
The signing in Los Angeles was witnessed by Malaysian Prime

Minister Mahathir Mohamad who is there especially on a working

trip to promote his country's Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC).
</P>
<P>
Details of the agreements and MOUs were not immediately

available, the Malaysian national news agency Bernama reported.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir, who underlined the government's commitment to

promoting the use of information technology (IT) and of IT-based

enterprises in his 1997 new year message, left here on January 12

for the United States and will also go to Japan after his U.S.

trip on January 18 to promote the MSC, a brainchild of him.
</P>
<P>
The MSC is a 15-by-50 kilometers zone that encompasses Kuala

Lumpur and four mega infrastructural projects: Kuala Lumpur City

Center, the new administrative center in Putrajaya, the

"intelligent" city -- Cyber city, and the new Kuala Lumpur

International Airport.
</P>
<P>
World-class multimedia corporations are being invited to locate

their business units and research and development facilities in

this multimedia growth center which will be connected by a digital

optical fiber backbone with an unprecedented 2.5-10 gigabits per

second capacity.
</P>
<P>
The Malaysian government commits the following to companies

with MSC status: providing a world-class physical and information

infrastructure, allowing unrestricted employment of local and

foreign knowledge workers, ensuring freedom of ownership by

exempting companies with MSC status from local ownership

requirements, giving the freedom to source capital for MSC

infrastructure and the right to borrow funds globally, providing

competitive financial incentives, ensuring no Internet censorship

and providing globally competitive telecommunications tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The incentives Malaysia provides to companies with MSC status

include substantial financial incentives such as a 0-percent

income tax for up to 10 years or a 100-percent investment tax

allowance, and no duties on multimedia equipment; the sole right

to tender for key implementation contracts for flagship

applications; direct access to Malaysia's top leadership through

membership of the MSC's International Advisory Panel (IAP) chaired

by the prime minister, and the Founders' Council chaired by the

deputy prime minister as well as support from the Multimedia

Development Corporation (MDC)'s one-stop client center that will

expedite visas, licenses and work permits.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that Mahathir will announce the names of the 25

permanent members of the IAP during his trip in the United States.

<HEADLINE> New Customs Office Opens in Beijing Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A warehouse-equipped customs

office became operational recently near the Capital International

Airport to facilitate the growing flow of cargo shipping.
</P>
<P>
The new facility has an 8,000-sq.m. customs building and 36

warehouse units.
</P>
<P>
About 30 companies engaged in international cargo, including

the world-wide express delivery giants DHL and UPS, and China

Ocean-going Shipping Corporation, have rented warehouse space, and

dozens more are expected in future.
</P>
<P>
The office provides great convenience because it can offer

unified services of a warehouse, customs procedures, and

transportation.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that by 1999, when an expansion project is

completed, the airport's cargo handling capacity will increase to

780,000 tons. The previous 20 separate warehouses have been found

to be inadequate.

<HEADLINE> Japan Calls For Enhancing Exchanges With China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Japan called here today for

efforts from countries around the world to support China's reform

and opening-up and enhance wide-ranging exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
Relations with China is an "extremely important factor" in

maintaining stability and economic prosperity in the Asia Pacific,

said Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto when delivering his

policy speech entitled "Reforms for the New Era of Japan and ASEAN

-- For a Broader and Deeper Partnership".
</P>
<P>
"Every ASEAN (Association of South East Asian Nations) country

has deep-rooted and inseparable relations with China in

historical, cultural, political and economic terms. The same is

true of Japan," he noted in his speech at the 15th Singapore

lecture.
</P>
<P>
He said now that China has been following a path of

modernization through its policy of reform and opening, she takes

more part in every arena.
</P>
<P>
"It is important for the rest of the world to support the

policy direction and to enhance wide-ranging dialogues and

exchanges with China so that she can secure her position as a

constructive partner in the international community," the Japanese

prime minister stressed.
</P>
<P>
Japan's ODA (Official Development Assistance) project to China

is implemented from that viewpoint, he said, adding that yen loan

projects play a role in promoting public infrastructure

development required for China's economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"I am convinced that the presence of a politically stable,

economically prosperous China, bound by ties of trust with the

rest of the world, would be in everybody's interest in the Asia

Pacific and the world over," Hashimoto stated.
</P>
<P>
"My view is that the relations among Japan, the United States

and China will have an important impact on the entire Asia

Pacific. Improved Japan-US, Japan-China and US-China relations

will contribute to peace and prosperity in the region," he

continued.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto arrived here Sunday on a three-day official visit,

his first as Japanese prime minister. He is scheduled to leave

Singapore for home this afternoon.

<HEADLINE> 46 Candidates to Run for Nepal's House By-Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Forty-six candidates have

been registered for the by-elections for five vacant seats in

Nepal's House of Representatives to be held later this month,

election officials here said today.
</P>
<P>
The candidates, including 19 independents, will contest for the

five house seats left vacant by deaths of two MPs last year and

three MPs winning in two constituencies in the 1994 mid-term

election.
</P>
<P>
Major political parties in the country, including main ruling

the Nepali Congress (NC) and main opposition the Communist Party

of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML), are paying much

attention to the by-elections in order to increase their

respective strength in the Lower House.
</P>
<P>
The five House seats will be crucial for both the NC and the

CPN-UML, the two largest parties in the country, as the NC wants

to replace the CPN-UML as the single largest party in the

Parliament by winning all the five seats.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML party currently has 87 MPs in the 205-seat Lower

House while the NC holds 86 seats.
</P>
<P>
The by-elections are scheduled for January 24 in five

constituencies in different parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> U.N. System Supports South-South Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations system has

given priority to support of South-South cooperation, James

Gustave Speth, Administrator of United Nations Development

Program, said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South-South Conference on Trade, Investment and

Finance, which opened here today, Speth said that while the

developing countries bear primary responsibility for the

formulation and promotion of South-South cooperation, the U.N.

system is well placed to provide support in this effort.
</P>
<P>
"Indeed, with offices in virtually every developing country,

the UNDP country office network is uniquely capable of supporting

South-South cooperation. Various U.N. organizations have been

given specific South-South mandates," he said.
</P>
<P>
South-South cooperation must serve both as a strategy in

support of the development efforts of countries and also as a

means of ensuring the developing world's effective participation

in the newly emerging global economic order, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On trade, he said there had been a significant increase in

South-South trade over the years, and there also existed

considerable potential for the further expansion of such trade in

the future.
</P>
<P>
In order to facilitate the expansion, developing countries need

to put in place the necessary infrastructure, including adequate

trade information systems and a suitable regulatory trading

framework, according to the official.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries need to institute suitable trade financing

mechanisms and intensify cooperation by ensuring increased

compatibility in their trade financing systems, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the area of investment, there was already a growing pattern

of investment among developing countries. However, virtually all

private direct foreign investment in the developing world had been

concentrated on a short list of middle income countries.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, multilateral development assistance remained

essential in enabling developing countries to benefit from

opportunities offered by globalization and economic

liberalization, he said.
</P>
<P>
Development assistance remained vital for scores of countries,

of which more than 100 were worse off today than 15 years ago, and

the downward trend in official development assistance must be

reversed, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also called for the establishment of a partnership between

the UNDP, the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development

and the United Nations International Development Organization.

<HEADLINE> Paraplegics Walk Again after New Operation in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A man crippled by a serious

work accident can walk and work, thanks to a breakthrough

treatment developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Doctors in Shanghai said that many paraplegic patients are

able to stand and walk again after special operations are

performed to repair damaged spinal cord nerves.
</P>
<P>
A construction worker surnamed after Bao, from Shaoxing City,

east China's Zhejiang Province, become paralysed in March of 1995

because of a lumbar vertebrae fracture.
</P>
<P>
After undergoing a nerve transplant operation, during which his

broken nerves were reconnected, he could stand and walk again, take

care of himself and do some light work.
</P>
<P>
Document retrieval systems both at home and abroad indicate

that that there are no records of similar operations conducted so

far.
</P>
<P>
Paraplegic patients suffer spinal cord injuries resulting in

organs in the lower part of stomach suffering function failure.
</P>
<P>
But the doctors in China say such patients can be expected to

stand and walk again, mostly aided by walking sticks, after

undergoing a special operation to repair spinal cord nerves.
</P>
<P>
Experts in Shanghai regard the method as a major breakthrough

in the treatment of paraplegia, which may bring recovery to

thousands of paraplegic patients.
</P>
<P>
The new method was developed by Zhang Shaocheng, a doctor at

the Changhai Hospital attached to the No.2 Medical College of the

Chinese PLA in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
He has successfully conducted operations on several paraplegic

patients under 40 years of age who suffered from wounds below the

12th thoracic vertebrae within the previous year.
</P>
<P>
All had wounded the neural roots at the broken parts of the

spinal cord. After direct anastomosing of the neuro roots, or

transplanting parts of nerves to bridge the two wounded ends of

spinal cords, their wounded nerves were effectively repaired. The

patients were able to stand and walk a short distance with walking

sticks.
</P>
<P>
The paraplegia, caused by spinal cord injuries, is a serious

disease that results in many people losing organ functions in the

lower part of their bodies.
</P>
<P>
After years of researches, Dr. Zhang discovered that a fracture

between the 12th thoracic vertebrae to the second lumbar vertebrae

spine, would lead to the combined injury of the central nervous

system and its surrounding nervous system. Thus a person with such

wounds would become paraplegic in most of the cases.
</P>
<P>
According to his theory, pure spinal cord injuries to those

parts need not cause paraplegia. Paraplegic patients can recover

if the wounded nerves are repaired.

BANGKOK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- A Thai senator suspected of

masterminding the murder of a doctor in October last year may be

subject to arrest if police have firm evidence.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladeshi Parliament to Go into Session Tomorrow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi parliament is

going into session on Wednesday amidst political dithering as the

tangle between the ruling party and the main opposition is yet to

be resolved.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Speaker Humayun Rashid Chowdhury is learnt to hold

formal talks today between the ruling Awami (people's) League (AL)

and the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), in a bid to

workout a solution to the current impasse.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing session will be the third one of the seventh

parliament and the first one in the new year.
</P>
<P>
The last session of the parliament, elected in the June 12

polls, began on November 1 and was prorogued on November 20. The

opposition BNP on November 10 started abstaining from attending

the session to press its 10-point demands submitted to the

speaker.
</P>
<P>
Its demands include ensuring neutrality of the speaker, release

of political detainees and equitable coverage on the state-run

radio and television.
</P>
<P>
Of late, the ruling party has taken initiative to woo the BNP

back into parliament. Speaker Chowdhury last Sunday night held a

meeting with the BNP leaders trying to break the stalemate.
</P>
<P>
Chowdhury was quoted as saying on Monday night that the ruling

AL is going to discuss with the BNP everything with open mind and

bring the opposition back to the house.

electronics and components rose by 10.2 percent to 362.32 million

US dollars in October 1996 from 328.66 million dollars in the same

month of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Data from the Philippine National Statistics Office indicated

at 12.8 percent of the 2.83 billion dollar import bill in October.
</P>
<P>
On a monthly basis, the electronics import went up by 11.5

percent from the September figure of 324.92 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The industrial machinery came in second, with the purchases

amounting to 304.92 million dollars, or 10.8 percent of the total

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Deposit Gold with IMF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's central bank is to

deposit its gold reserves with the International Monetary Fund

(IMF) as a means to better match its foreign assets and

liabilities, according to the Nation newspaper today.
</P>
<P>
Rerngchai Marakanond, governor of the Bank of Thailand (BOT),

said the deposits would generate income for the BOT, because the

IMF guarantees a minimum return.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as part of the Thai central bank's policy to

manage the international reserves for maximum returns at minimum

risk while ensuring they are still available to stabilize

liquidity in the local money market.
</P>
<P>
Up to now the BOT has made gold deposits with the US Federal

Reserve but receives no income.
</P>
<P>
The new move will also improve the matching of the central

bank's assets and liabilities. The assets side contains almost

solely long-term assets, while the liabilities side, which is

valued at 89 billion dollars, is mostly short-term.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's gold reserves are not large, totaling 962.8 million

dollars, or only 2.44 percent of the total foreign reserves of

39.4 billion dollars as of June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The central bank will implement new guidelines for better

reserve management in the middle of this year so that the BOT will

reap more income, the BOT governor was quoted as saying.

KUNMING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China's Yunnan Province has

launched its first tree-planting projects to prevent soil erosion

and deterioration of the environment along the upper reaches of

the Pearl River.
</P>
<P>
A total of 2.84 million mu (170,400 hectares) of trees will be

planted along the river, which is one of China's seven major

rivers. It has three branches: the Xijiang, Beijiang, and

Dongjiang, watering a total of 453,700 sq.km., with an annual

volume of 326 billion cubic meters, five times that of the Yellow

River.
</P>
<P>
But, because of poor development, eroded areas along the river

increased from 41,100 square kilometers in the 1950s to the 76,700

square kilometers by the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
The designed tree-planting area of the Pearl River will cover

10,800 hectares, at a cost of 1.08 billion yuan. Forest shelters

cover 177 counties in Yunnan, Guizhou, and Guangdong provinces and

the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, over 403,900 sq.km.
</P>
<P>
The tree-planting area in Yunnan Province is 303,000

hectares. When the projects are completed, the forest coverage

rate in the areas will rise to 36.44 percent from the current

19.25 percent, and the ratio of eroded areas will drop from 43.07

percent to 27 percent.

NANCHANG, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Tourism has become a pillar

industry in the northeastern part of China's Jiangxi Province, in

part because of efforts to develop new scenic spots, and to

</P>
<P>
Jiangxi has four state-level scenic sites. Two of them, Longhu

tourism revenues and the number of tourists have seen double-digit

increases in recent years. About 130 million yuan was spent on

developing the two mountains in the past few years.

There are now more than 4,000 beds at hotels at Sanqing

Mountain, and cable cars have been operational at the tourist

attraction. A dozen scenic spots have also been built or restored

there.

<HEADLINE> Greater South-South Cooperation Urged in G-77 Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Jose

Maria Figueres today urged developing countries to increase

south-south cooperation to overcome their economic and social

problems and speed up development.
</P>
<P>
"We have the possibility to lead a profound change in the

development style of our countries, born from ourselves, because

no one knows our own needs more than we do," said Figueres,

speaking at the inaugural session of a 3-day conference on trade,

investment and finance among representatives of 108 countries from

the Group of 77 (G-77) and China.
</P>
<P>
"No one will come and do for us what we are not willing to do,"

he said.
</P>
<P>
Figueres said developing nations face many challenges,

including poverty, lack of healthcare, inadequate education

systems, inefficient and out-dated production methods, corruption

and environmental degradation.
</P>
<P>
The G-77 was set up in 1964 as a forum for developing nations.
</P>
<P>
Figueres proposed an integral, sustainable style of development

that would benefit not only current generations but also future

ones.
</P>
<P>
As for his strategy for development, Figueres felt

macroeconomic balances were indispensable for increasing internal

savings rates and the flow of foreign investment.
</P>
<P>
That development must now be based on private capital flows for

which macroeconomic balances are indispensable, he added.
</P>
<P>
The other proposals cited by Figueres to stimulate development

were: "Strategic Social Investment", especially in the areas of

health, education and housing and that of the environment.
</P>
<P>
Developing countries must learn from the problems that the

model adopted by the industrialized nations created for the

environment, he said, emphasising that the biggest part of the

biodiversity on the earth is found in countries in the southern

hemisphere.
</P>
<P>
At the end of the meeting, Costa Rica will hand over the

presidency of the G-77 to Tanzania.

<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China will strengthen its

supervision of ground subsidence caused by over-extraction of

groundwater, said today's "China Daily".
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-based English language newspaper quoted Li Lierong

a senior official from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral

Resources as saying: "To date, ground subsidence has been reported

in over 30 cities."
</P>
<P>
Ground subsidence has caused underground pipes to break and

houses to collapse in some cities. In Suzhou of Jiangsu Province,

it has led to the collapse of bridge and rise of river banks.
</P>
<P>
Due to efficient supervision and control of extraction of

groundwater by local governments, annual ground subsidence

has fallen to 3-5 millimeters since the 1970's, down from an

annual 90-110 millimeters before 1964, he said.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, he added, the ground subsidence in Shanghai and

Tianjin is under control.
</P>
<P>
He took notice of fast economic growth in the Yangtze River

Delta area, which covers the most prosperous part of Jiangsu

Province, and said that it has accelerated local extraction of

groundwater in recent years.
</P>
<P>
He urged localities to take joint efforts to that end. "As

severe ground subsidence nullifies any construction achievement,

local governments must realize the importance of the supervision

and control of ground subsidence."
</P>

<HEADLINE> Ecuadoran President Arrives in Peru for Official Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LIMA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadoran President Abdala Bucaram

arrived here today to start a three-day "bridge-building" official

visit to Peru at the invitation of his Peruvian counterpart,

Alberto Fujimori.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram, the first Ecuadoran head of state to visit Peru

officially, will meet with Fujimori and sign four agreements on

health in border towns, the salvaging of archaeological assets,

disaster cooperation and educational matters.
</P>
<P>
President Bucaram and his entourage, which includes ministers,

businessmen and journalists, arrived at the Jorge Chavez

International Airport, where Fujimori met them.
</P>
<P>
Bucaram inherited from his predecessor, Sixto Duran-Ballen, an

advanced process of rapprochement between Quito and Lima after a

border dispute in the Cordillera del Condor region over which a

short war was fought in January-February 1995.
</P>
<P>
Describing Bucaram's visit as an exceptional event, Fujimori

said that both presidents would help create a climate of greater

confidence between their two countries.
</P>
<P>
An editorial by the local "Expresso" newspaper urged Peru to

appreciate the gesture made by Ecuadoran President Abadala Bucaram

which broke a tradition that Ecuadoran presidents didn't pay

official visits to Peru.
</P>
<P>
It said Bucaram had "sent out friendly signals."
</P>
<P>
"Up till now, he is giving the impression of wanting to change

the tone in our bilateral relations and to find permanent

solutions," the editorial said. "It is an impetus that should be

taken advantage of to resolve our problems."
</P>
<P>
Before leaving for Peru, Bucaram said his visit "is fundamental

for the functioning of bilateral relations with our Peruvian

brothers as well as in our desperate quest for peace between the

two peoples."
</P>
<P>
Peruvian Foreign Minister Francisco Tudel is a big absentee

during the Ecuadoran president's visit because he is one of the 74

hostages still being held by a rebel group in Japanese Ambassador

Morihisa Aoki's residence in Lima.

<HEADLINE> Rioters in Indonesian Town to Stand Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Forty-two people will be tried

for rioting last month around Tasikmalaya town, in Indonesia's

West Java province, that left four dead and scores of buildings

damaged, Antara news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
"From the 123 suspects initially arrested, there are only 51 in

detention and from that, (the cases of) 42 of them will be handed

over to the Attorney General's office," West Java police chief

Major General Nana Permana was quoted as saying on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The riots erupted in the town on December 26 last year in

protest against the alleged mistreatment of three Muslim teachers

by policemen. It spread to surrounding districts.
</P>
<P>
After attacking a police post, the mob went on the rampage that

left more than 100 buildings and 100 cars damaged.
</P>
<P>
Charges against defendants are prepared by the Attorney

General's office based on police files of their questioning,

Permana said.
</P>
<P>
He said the 42 to face trial were those who police had found

engaged in criminal actions during the riots.
</P>
<P>
Police have already dismissed four policemen from the force for

brutality. Permana said last month that the four policemen would

be court-martialled but he gave no further detail.

<HEADLINE> Country Girls Trained to Be Maids for City Dwellers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- With a concerned expression on

her face, Mrs. Zhu turned and walked out of the Sanba Maids

Service Company with her husband.
</P>
<P>
Once again the service had tried but failed to find a maid to

meet Zhu's expectations, according to today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
"I am tired of showing these young girls how to do the

housekeeping chores," said the 60-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
But she also has a reason to be happy. Beijing's 30 maid

service companies are busily training new home helpers to fill the

numerous available positions throughout the city, said Wang

Guofeng, an official with the Beijing Labour Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The maids' training service is in response to the release of a

specification on home helpers by the Ministry of Labor.
</P>
<P>
"It was established to standardize practices." said Li Jingmei,

a Labour Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Maids will be required to obtain certificates before they take

a job, according to the regulation, which lists the skills they

must first acquire.
</P>
<P>
They should know how to perform their work as well as how to

protect themselves, Li said.
</P>
<P>
New text books for maids will be published in March to help

them in their training.
</P>
<P>
Surplus labor from the countryside began moving into the cities

in the early 1980s. Some of the women chose to work as maids, the

paper said.
</P>
<P>
The quickening steps of urban life and the growing number of

families, where husband and wife both work to earn a better

living, gave impetus to the maid industry.
</P>
<P>
With nearly one million maids in the country now, some 80,000

people are serving as home helpers in Beijing, said Song Jian,

an official with the Labor Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The girls willing to serve as maids in cities are usually

brought up in the countryside. When they arrive here, they have

difficulty meeting an employer's expectations and needs for a

housekeeper, Song said.
</P>
<P>
Zhu has hired maids intermittently for ten years. "They don't

know how to handle all the machines," she recalled.

<HEADLINE> Free Trade in ALADI Increases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MONTEVIDEO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Free trade among the member

countries of the Latin American Integration Association (ALADI)

increased nearly 5 times in the 3 years between 1993-1996.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent report by ALADI secretary general Antonio

Antunes, only 12.2 percent of the trade within the association in

1993 was tariff-free, but three years later the percentage reached

56.8.
</P>
<P>
Antunes attributed the surge to the economic opening up on the

continent, and concretely to the bilateral and multilateral

agreements signed by the association's member states.
</P>
<P>
The organization was formed by Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil,

Costa Rica, Chile, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and

Venezuela.
</P>
<P>
Antunes predicted that free trade among the organization will

rise to 77.2 percent in the year 2007, due to Chile and Bolivia's

admission to the Southern Common Market (Mercosur), the startup of

Chile-Colombia-Venezuela agreements, and the one between Bolivia

and Mexico as well as dozens of new generation free trade

agreements.
</P>
<P>
Trade liberation is advancing in proportion with the increase

of trade volumes of the 11 ALADI member countries, Antunes pointed

out.
</P>
<P>
Between 1989 and 1995, overall exports from the 11 countries

more than doubled to over 206 billion U.S. dollars while imports

tripled to 205 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Trade among the ALADI member countries jumped from 11 billion

dollars in 1989 to 35 billion in 1995, an increase of more than

300 percent.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Foreign trade in China's

largest industrial city of Shanghai was worth 52.87 billion US

dollars in 1996, up 9.8 percent over 1995, thanks to the city's

restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
According to a municipal government official, the restructuring

covered a wide range of enterprises. Foreign-funded firms became a

main force in the city's imports and exports, contributing 49.1

percent to the total trade volume.
</P>
<P>
Foreign trade conducted by state-run firms amounted to 26

billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to customs' statistics, processed goods contributed

40.3 percent to the total trade volume, at 21.3 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech product exports and high added-value exports like

electro-mechanical goods, complete plants, food, and medicine have

dominated Shanghai's exports, replacing traditional products like

textiles and steel. Electro-mechanical goods were worth six

billion US dollars, 17 percent more than 1995.
</P>
<P>
Hi-tech goods are new exports, and were worth 400 million US

dollars last year, a 64 percent increase over 1995. Developed

countries have become the favorite market for Shanghai's

technology exports.

ambassador of Tanzania, the country that will replace Costa Rica

in providing the presidency of the G-77.
</P>
<P>
United Nations' General Assembly President Razali Ismail

reiterated the importance of south-south cooperation and the

economic success achieved by several countries in this region.

But, he added, they were relative successes compared with the vast

areas and populations that were still marginalized in the south.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations' new Secretary-General, Kofi Annan, also

sent a message to the conference reaffirming his commitment to

south-south cooperation and declared his hope that developing

countries would benefit, rather than suffer, from the consequences

of economic globalization.

<HEADLINE> China on Move to Pipe up Northwest Powerhouse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- China has an ambitious 600 to

800 billion yuan program to tap the resouces of its treasure-house

in the Northwest, known as "Daxibei" or the Big Northwest, which

accounts for about a third of China's total landspace.
</P>
<P>
This will include more than 200 key projects in Shaanxi,

Qinghai, and Gansu provinces, and the Xinjiang and Ningxia

autonomous regions during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Funds for the projects, which are expected to fuel local

economic growth in the 21st century, will come from the central

government, local government, and overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
The Northwest is rich in agricultural resources, hydro-electric

power, coal, oil, gas, and nonferrous metals. Petroleum reserves

in Xinjiang alone are estimated at 30 to 50 billion tons, a third

of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
The idea to build the area into a powerhouse follows a central

government decision to shift China's stress of industrial

development from the east to the west and its medium- and

long-term strategy of supporting the development of western areas.
</P>
<P>
Topping the list of projects are the oil and gas fields in

Xinjiang's Tarim Basin, the oil and gas fields in the

Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia triangle, the Lijiaxia hydro-electric dam in

Qinghai, agricultural bases in Xinjiang and Gansu, and the Golmud

potash fertilizer base in Qinghai.
</P>
<P>
China has set 43 percent of its major resources development and

infrastructure projects for the last five years of this century

for this vast, but economically backward region. Input in the

Xinjiang oil and gas fields is expected to amount to 100 billion

yuan.
</P>
<P>
To cash in on the program, the northwestern provinces and

autonomous regions have come up with their development

priorities: oil and cotton in Xinjiang, coal, gas, and petroleum

in Shaanxi, hydro-electric power and salt chemicals in Qinghai,

agriculture and nonferrous metals in Gansu, and farming, coal and

raw materials in Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, the first year in the Ninth Five-Year Plan, fixed

asset investment in these five areas outstripped the national

average for the first time. Relatively under-developed Qinghai

province got 7.5 billion yuan for resource development projects

last year, 30 percent more than the previous year.
</P>
<P>
All this activity is attracting the interest of international

conglomerates like Ameco and Esso, and the number of investors

from the United States, Japan, Britain, Israel, and Italy coming

to the Northwest is on the rise.

<HEADLINE> Manila Wants Resumption of Integration Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 14 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine military has

urged the resumption of the integration of Moro National

Liberation Front (MNLF) members into the military and police.
</P>
<P>
Major General Victor Garcia, spokesman for the Armed Forces,

said it would be "faulty" to suspend this program indefinitely,

the local newspaper Business World reported today.
</P>
<P>
A peace agreement signed last September between the MNLF and

Manila provides for the integration of 5,500 MNLF members into the

Armed Forces and 2,000 others into the Philippine National Police.
</P>
<P>
The program was suspended last December upon the request of

MNLF chief Nur Misuari due to corruption among program

administrators, application by impostors of MNLF members, and

infiltration by extremist Muslim groups through this program.
</P>
<P>
The landmark September peace deal ended more than two decades

of bitter war in the southern Philippines between the government

forces and the MNLF, the largest Muslim separatist group at that

time.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement was rejected by other Muslim rebel groups,

including the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the fundamentalist

Abu Sayyaf group.

<HEADLINE> Loans for East China Nuclear Power Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 14 (Xinhua) -- Agreements for providing 1.84

billion U.S. dollars of loans to finance a nuclear power plant in

Zhejiang Province were signed Monday in Beijing, "China Daily"

reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreements were signed by the State Development Bank (SDB),

Export Development Co of Canada (EDC) and the Export-Import Bank

of America.
</P>
<P>
The money will be used to import equipment for the construction

of the third phase of the Qinshan nuclear power plant which is a

turn-key project undertaken by Canada and will have two

heavy-water reactor generators.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreements, the loans, bearing an interest rate of

6.54 percent, will be repaid in 15 years with a grace period of

seven years.
</P>
<P>
With the money, the third phase of the Qinshan nuclear power

plant will start construction soon. According to a SDB official,

the third-stage construction is estimated to require 2.68 billion

U.S. dollars in foreign exchange, all of which will be raised by

SDB, a policy bank responsible for pooling funds for the country's

key state infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
Atomic Energy of Canada Limited acts as the general contractor

for the third-phase construction, and the US-based architectural

engineering company Bechtel and Japan's trading company Itochu Co

as sub-contractors.
</P>
<P>
The first generator is expected to produce electricity by 2003

and the second by 2004.
</P>
<P>
Qinshan nuclear power plant is located in haiyan of Zhejiang,

around 120 km from Shanghai. The plant is designed to provide

electricity for east China, which has developed a booming economy

but still suffers from a serious power shortage.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the Chinese-designed project went into

operation in 1991 with a generating capacity of 300,000 kw. It was

put into commercial operation in April 1994.
</P>
<P>
The second phase of construction of the Qinshan nuclear power

plant was launched in June 1996. It involves the installation of

two generators with a capacity of 600,000 kw each.
</P>
<P>
The project will be finished in June 2003. The total

investment on the project is abut 14.2 billion yuan (1.71 billion

U.S. dollars).

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav Government Adopts Report on Croatia's War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Yugoslav government

adopted on Monday a report on war crimes and genocide against the

Serb people during the recent civil war in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
The report, prepared by the Yugoslav committee for gathering

information about crimes against humanity and the international

law, focuses on war crimes committed by the members of the

Croatian army against the Serb people during Operation Storm in

early August 1995, a statement issued by the Yugoslav Information

Secretariat said.
</P>
<P>
The report cited more than 90 cases on the war crimes, one of

which was that the Croatian army drove over 250,000 Krajina Serbs

out of their ancestral homes in Croatia during the offensive by

the Croatian government troops in August 1995.
</P>
<P>
"This genocide plan has transformed the Serbs from a

constitutive nation in Croatia to a minority making up only three

percent of the population of Croatia," the report said.
</P>
<P>
Two months later, the Fourth Croatian Army joined the Bosnian

Croat Army to occupy the region of Mrkonjic Grad, the Serb land

in central Bosnian, in October 1995.
</P>
<P>
During the Croats' occupation, hundreds of Serb people were

killed, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In the exhumation of one mass grave at the Orthodox cemetery

in Mrkonjic Grad in early 1996, 181 Serb remains were dug out,

including old people, women and children.
</P>
<P>
The report also contains data about the violation of the

international war and humanitarian law in the town of Visegrad in

Serb territory in eastern Bosnia during the Bosnian civil war,

crimes in a camp located in a Silo in the village of Tarcin in

central Bosnia, and the abuse of medical institutions in Sarajevo

in military aims, etc.
</P>
<P>
The report will be sent to the corresponding international

bodies primarily the United Nations and the Belgrade office of the

International Tribunal for War Crimes in former Yugoslavia, the

statement said.

<HEADLINE> South-South Cooperation Becomes Imperative, G77 Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Economic and technical

cooperation among developing countries represents an urgent need

that is becoming more imperative than ever, said Daudin Mwakawago,

chairman of the Group of 77 for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the South-South Conference on Trade, Investment and

Finance which opened here today, Mwakawago, also permanent

representative of Tanzania to the United Nations, said that the

prospectives of achieving objectives and aspirations for

development and prosperity are closely related to maintaining and

strengthening unity and coordination of the activities of the

Group of 77 and China.
</P>
<P>
"With the increasing obstacles faced in our economic

development, with the North-South dialogue stalled, and the

emerging complementarities within developing countries, the scope

of economic and technical cooperation among developing countries

is even more pressing today than it was at the beginning of the

decade when the Caracas Program of Action was adopted," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the reforms of the developing countries are

carried out in difficult conditions because the international

economic environment remains as always fundamentally unfavorable

to recovery and take off of the economies of the Third World.
</P>
<P>
"Financial, commercial and technological constraints which make

difficult and problematic the implementation of these reforms must

be eliminated," he said.
</P>
<P>
On external debt of developing countries, he said, a

satisfactory resolution of the issue is absolutely necessary and

urgent for the international community. "Today there are countries

in the South which are spending between 40 and 60 percent of their

export earnings on servicing the debt."
</P>
<P>
It is a matter of urgency that the international community

marshals enough political will to ensure an open, rule-based,

equitable, secure, non-discriminatory, transparent and predictable

multilateral trading system with the aim of achieving the complete

integration of the developing countries into the world economy and

the new international trade system, he said.
</P>
<P>
He also urged reform of financial and monetary system so that

new and additional resources will be available to meet the needs

of developing countries in the field of development and economic

growth.
</P>
<P>
"In conclusion, it is important to underscore the crucial role

of collective action to promote the collective interests of

developing countries in the economic and social development

fields," he said.

to 5 percent, and the external current account deficit contained

at 8 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Should Pay Debt Owed to World Bank: Rubin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States must pay

the debt it owes to the World Bank and others if it wants the

leading efforts to help poorer countries economic development,

U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin said here today.
</P>
<P>
Rubin made the remarks while speaking at the opening session of

an international development conference, a meeting to discuss new

strategies for reducing world poverty. The session was attended by

the World Bank President James D. Wolfensohn and Secretary-General

of the Organization for African Unity Salim A. Salim and hundreds

of specialists.
</P>
<P>
It was reported the U.S government owed 1.3 billion U.S.

dollars debt to the United Nations in addition to more than 1

billion dollars to the World Bank and 620 million dollars to

regional development banks.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. top financial official said the United States "cannot

continue as the only major nation in the world with large scale

arrears to the World Bank" and other development banks.
</P>
<P>
Rubin noted he and other members of the Clinton administration

discussed the issue Saturday and were committed to working with

Congress to obtain the funds needed "within the constraints of our

balanced budget goals."
</P>
<P>
He said it was up to the U.S. administration, Congress and the

business community "to rebuild America's commitments to these

programs... The case for U.S. leadership is clear and long-term

U.S. interests are at stake."
</P>
<P>
One of the great lessons of the 20th century is that

"withdrawal from international affairs cannot work," Rubin

stressed, adding "When we withdraw we suffer, when we engage we

prosper."

<HEADLINE> U.S.: Additional Work Remains on Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Despite "a lot of progress"

having been made on a deal over Israeli troops' pullbacks from

rural areas, there is still "additional work" to be done between

the Israelis and Palestinians before they can strike a final

accord on the West Bank city of Hebron, the U.S. State Department

said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns told reporters that

thanks to the weekend intervention of King Hussein of Jordan, "a

lot of progress" had been made, including a compromise on the

Israeli troops' pullbacks from the West Bank rural areas before

mid-1998.
</P>
<P>
But "there is no deal yet and there remains the need for

additional movement and additional work by both the Israelis and

Palestinians before there can be a deal" on Hebron, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher has asked Dennis Ross,

the U.S. Middle East envoy, to call off a plan to return to the

United States on Sunday evening, and would "evaluate on a

day-by-day basis" to decide how long Ross should stay in the

region, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the White House said President Bill Clinton had talked

through telephoned to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak about the

Israeli-palestinian negotiations on Hebron.
</P>
<P>
Clinton on Sunday called Mubarak "to exchange views with him on

the status of the dialogue" and learned Mubarak's insights "into

the thinking of those who are negotiating," White House press

secretary Mike McCurry told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Clinton received regular reports on the talks from Ross, deputy

national security adviser Samuel Berger and others, and has

"offered some thoughts" on how to resolve differences that have

been stalling an agreement on Hebron, McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
The White House press secretary said "some progress" has been

made at the Israeli-Palestinian negotiating table, but "there are

differences that remain between the parties."
</P>
<P>
He warned reporters against being "excessively

forward-leaning", saying "We are not encouraging people to leap to

exuberant degrees of optimism. this is a process that requires

hard work."

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

denounced the end of cease-fire and the continued use of violence

by the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
In a written statement today marking the resumption of the

peace talks in Belfast, Clinton said: "I am deeply outraged by the

end of the IRA cease-fire, which threatens to plunge Northern

Ireland into a senseless spiral of violence."
</P>
<P>
The IRA ended an 18-month cease-fire last February by blasting

a huge bomb in east London, which led to the exclusion of its

political wing, Sinn Fein, from peace talks. It again fired a

rocket attack last week on the High Court in Belfast, raising

fears of a new cycle of violence.
</P>
<P>
In his statement, Clinton said, "I have always believed that

the Belfast talks will have a better chance of success if all the

elected parties, including Sinn Fein, are at the table.
</P>
<P>
"But that can only happen if the IRA declares and implements a

cease-fire in both words a"

Denktash agreed to give their full support to immediate

implementation of the package of measures proposed by the United

Nations," State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said at a

briefing.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh was also assured by Clerides that none of the

surface-to-air missiles his government plans to purchase from

Russia will be deployed for 16 months, he added.
</P>
<P>
"This effectively defuses the crisis," Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Cavanaugh also discussed with the two leaders a U.S-sponsored

ban on Greek and Turkish military flights over Cyprus. And

"discussions on this question will continue when Carey visits

Athens tomorrow and Wednesday, and Ankara, I believe, on

thursday," Burns said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Urges Senate to Ratify Chemical Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton

today urged the Senate to ratify an international chemical weapons

treaty before it takes effect without U.S. participation in April.
</P>
<P>
"The security of our soldiers and citizens is at stake, as is

the economic well-being of our chemical industry," Clinton said in

a statement released today.
</P>
<P>
The United States signed the Chemical Weapons Convention, which

bans an entire class of weapons of mass destruction, four years

ago today, but it remains unratified.
</P>
<P>
"I urge the Senate to act promptly to ensure that the United

States remains at the forefront of international efforts to combat

the spread of weapons of mass destruction and the U.S. chemical

industry maintains its international competitiveness," Clinton

said.
</P>
<P>
"I look forward to working with the Senate leadership to get

the job done," he added.
</P>
<P>
Clinton warned Senate that failure to ratify the treaty before

it enters into effect on April 29 will adversely affect both U.S.

national security and economic interests.
</P>
<P>
The impact on the U.S. chemical industry alone, he estimated,

could mean a loss of as much as 600 million dollars a year in

export sales and jobs.

<HEADLINE> Bomb Attack on Police Patrol Reported in Belfast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A bomb attack has been launched

upon police patrol cars in Belfast, Northern Ireland this evening,

but police officers have escaped injury, according to a BBC

television report.
</P>
<P>
Two armored Land-Rovers were targeted as they drove through

the Republican Kenneday Way area in Belfast, the report said.
</P>
<P>
An Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) spokesman was quoted as

saying that the area has been sealed off while it was being

established whether a mortar had been fired or a device detonated

at the roadside.
</P>
<P>
This is the fifth such attack since the start of the new year

and local analysts said that the Irish Republican Army (IRA) is

deliberately targeting the RUC forces in its new bombing campaign.

<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United States may be

forced to cut some forms of assistance to South Africa if it goes

ahead with a 641 million U.S. dollars weapon deal with Syria, the

State Department said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We are deeply concerned about these reports," State Department

spokesman Nicholas Burns said. "It would be extremely serious if

these sales actually occurred. The United States hopes that the

South African government will not consummate arms sales" with

Syria which is on U.S. black list.
</P>
<P>
"We would certainly analyze any potential sales in the context

of our laws. It's a matter of very serious concern," he told a

news briefing.
</P>
<P>
White House press secretary Mike McCurry also said South

Africa's weapon deal with Syria is "a very bad idea."
</P>
<P>
"We have a strongly worded statement here that amounts to

saying we think that's a very bad idea," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
The United States provided $82 million in assistance to South

Africa last year, a small faction of which went for military

aid. Burns did not say how much of the aid might by affected by

the arms sale.

<HEADLINE> Britain, Argentina to Resume Talks on Fishing Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The British and Argentine

governments have agreed to resume their negotiations on the issue

of fishing rights in the disputed waters of the South Atlantic,

British government officials announced today.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind and his Argentine

counterpart Guido Di Tella made the decision to restart the talks

during informal talks held in London over the weekend, the

officials said.
</P>
<P>
"There will be a new effort on the idea of a long-term

fisheries agreement," one official said, adding that no specific

date has been set for the talks.
</P>
<P>
However, British officials stressed that there could be no

question of Britain offering to share or transfer sovereignty of

the islands to Argentina.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Argentina fought a ten-week war in 1982 over the

sovereignty of Falklands (Malvinas). The islands were recaptured

by Britain at the end of the war.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have later restored full diplomatic relations

and in 1995 signed a deal to explore for oil in waters around the

islands.
</P>
<P>
However, fishing rights has been a contentious issue between

the two countries with Argentina calling for further conservation

of fish resources in the region.
</P>
<P>
Last spring, Britain sent a destroyer to South Georgia,

southeast of the Falklands (Malvinas) to protect British fishing

fleet there.

<HEADLINE> World Bank President Urges U.S. to Continue Support for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- World Bank President James

D. Wolfensohn today called on U.S. leaders to continue investing

in programs such as the Bank's International Development

Association (IDA).
</P>
<P>
Addressing at an international development conference to an

audience which included U.S. Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin and

Secretary-General of the Organization for African Unity (OAU)

Salim A. Salim, Wolfensohn said that this is also a time when the

United States needs to lead again in terms of its international

responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
"Right now, America's level of overseas development assistance

has diminished to the point where the U.S. is in the unique

position of being the last of the OECD countries in terms of per

capita contribution to IDA," the World Bank chief noted.
</P>
<P>
"The time has come for America to re-engage," stressed

Wolfensohn. "IDA offers the United States a cost-effective vehicle

for addressing global issues such as environmental degradation,

poverty and instability ---as well as building open market and

democracy."
</P>
<P>
"IDA isn't charity," Wolfensohn underlined, "It's self

interest. Developing countries are the fastest growing U.S. export

market. Today they represent 40 percent of total U.S. exports.

Last year alone, U.S. export to the 79 countries eligible for IDA

came to over 25 billion U.S. dollars. And that means jobs here in

the United States."
</P>
<P>
Obviously, the World Bank leader said, "Investing in

development is in our interests because it affects our economic

life, our jobs, our environment, our health and our migration

policies."
</P>
<P>
According to the U.S. Treasury, exports to markets where the

World Bank and regional banks operate are responsible for creating

or sustaining nearly 4 million American jobs each year.
</P>
<P>
Wolfensohn said that although private capital flows to

developing countries last year reached an estimated 230 billion

dollars, 5 times the amount of official assistance, there is still

an urgent need for public finance to address challenges that the

private sector can not or will not presently reach.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the World Bank data, of the 230 billion

dollars in private capital, 75 percent is going to just 12

countries. "The entire continent of Africa received less than 5

billion dollars in private capital flows in 1995 --- less than 3

percent of the total for developing countries," Wolfensohn noted.
</P>
<P>
IDA is the World Bank's soft loan window which provides

interest free loans to the poorest countries with per capita

incomes below 865 dollars.

<HEADLINE> International Community Urged to Tighten Arms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Somalia today called on

the international community to take steps and tighten up arms

sanctions on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
The call was contained in a press release issued here by the

National Salvation Council of Somalia set up recently by leaders

of 26 Somali political movements.
</P>
<P>
The release urged members of the U.N. Security Council and

Inter-Governmental Authority on Development to intercept the ship

''Sea Impress'' to enforce the arms embargo on Somalia.
</P>
<P>
It said it has received reliable information that a great

quantity of arms and counterfeit Somali Shilling bank-notes are

being smuggled into Somalia, adding that the ''Sea Impress" with

a cargo of 28 containers full of arms and bank-notes is now

heading toward the port of Merca, Somalia which is under the

control of Hussein Aidid's faction.
</P>
<P>
The release pointed out that the smuggled arms will make the

Somali people suffer more.
</P>
<P>
''The introduction into the country of the counterfeit

currency will no doubt wreck whatever little remains of the

Somali economy and this will also affect the economies of the

neighboring countries,'' it noted.
</P>
<P>
The council called on Hussein Aidid to desist from all acts of

violence and inflicting further sufferings on the Somali people

and join them in the peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
The faction led by Hussein Aidid boycotted the meeting held in

Addis last month and condemned it as a betrayal of Somali cause.
</P>
<P>
The release frowned on Hassan Ali, an official of the Sudanese

embassy in Mogadishu who, while having a meeting with Al-Itihad,

a Moslem group, urged the Somali people to take up arms and wage

a holy war on Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The release said, ''we have always considered Sudan as a

brotherly country which wants Somalia to recover from the current

crisis and never expected to be involved in any destabilizing

activities in Somalia.''
</P>
<P>
We urged the Sudanese government to uphold and respect the

wishes of the Somali people to continue their efforts of

reconciling their differences in an atmosphere of peace and

non-interference, it said.

ATHENS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Ships remained at anchor at

ports around Greece as semen and dock workers began a 48-hour

strike today.

The protesters demanded that no changes be made to the fiscal

regime applicable since 1955.
</P>
<P>
The strike affected Greek-flag vessels of all categories as

well as foreign ships employing Greek seamen.

The seamen are also demanding measures to combat unemployment,

the absorption of unemployed colleagues and a minimum pension

equal to 80 percent of the present basic salary.

The labor action may develop into a rolling strike following

<HEADLINE> W. Bank Official Welcomes Zimbabwe's Economic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today welcomed

Zimbabwe's second phase of market reforms aimed at stabilizing

macro-economic stability and improving the lives of the majority

poor in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
David Cook, the bank's resident representative in Zimbabwe,

said here that the Zimbabwe government should target at resolving

some of the failures of the first phase of the reforms, which

were completed in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
"There is the unfinished agenda of the past, and one of them

is to achieve economic stability and get the budget deficit and

inflation under control. We have not made much progress in this

area in the first five years of the reforms," he said.
</P>
<P>
"This means we should continue the process of

commercialization and accelerate the privatization program, among

other things," said Cook.
</P>
<P>
He added while progress had been made to rationalize

Zimbabwe's bloated civil service, there was still a need to

devote more effort to reduce the size of government.
</P>
<P>
Cook stressed that the targets of central government

expenditure should be kept so as to sustain and support economic

growth during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank has blamed Zimbabwe for its excessive

government expenditure which accounted for the increased budget

deficit. The budget deficit has currently been estimated at 10.1

percent of the gross domestic product (GDP), and is likely to

reach 11 percent by June this year.
</P>
<P>
Cook said the reform should be aimed at improving the living

standards of the rural population, education and health care.
</P>
<P>
He added he was confident that the forthcoming talks among the

Zimbabwe government, the World Bank and the International

Monetary Fund would result in more concrete pledges to finance

the second phase of the reforms.

<HEADLINE> UK to Develop Joint Anti-Ballistic Missile System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Britain is to begin developing a

joint Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) defense system, using

high-powered lasers aboard modified Boeing 747 jumbo jets, when

the British government approves the proposal at a special meeting

later this month.
</P>
<P>
Although the possibility of defending Britain against missile

attack is still being considered, the immediate purpose of the ABM

system is to protect British troops deployed overseas in regions

like the Gulf, according to government sources.
</P>
<P>
The British Ministry of Defense has reportedly concluded that

Britain should not develop its own ABM system, but should "buy in"

components from the United States and cooperate with other NATO

Allies in developing a "theater defense" system.
</P>
<P>
The airborne lasers, designed to shoot down incoming missiles

in flight, would be just part of a complex anti-ballistic missile

system which would include early warning satellites and ship-borne

intercepter missiles.
</P>
<P>
The British Ministry of Defense was quoted by the Guardian

newspaper as saying in a statement that "our aim is to establish

our national priorities before looking at systems that might meet

our needs and at the scope for collaboration with allies."
</P>
<P>
"The findings (of the feasibility study) are informing this

work, as is the information gained through our close links with a

number of countries, including the U.S., on a range of ballistic

missile defense-related issues," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Britain is reportedly involved in several research programs

with the U.S. as well as NATO projects to assess the alliance's

response to the risks of ballistic missile proliferation.

NEW YORK, January 13 (Xinhua) -- U.S. business confidence edged

</P>
<P>
The Conference Board reported today that the measure of

business confidence closed at 54, up one point from the third

quarter of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The barometer is based on a quarterly survey of about 200 chief

executive officers (CEOs) representing a wide variety of

industries. Nearly 45 percent of CEOs say the economy has improved

during the last six months, compared with less than 43 percent in

the previous quarter.
</P>

accelerating economic growth in the next six months, down from

more than one-fourth in the third quarter," said Lynn Franco,

associate director of the board's Consumer Research Center.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Employ More Cuban Doctors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, January 13 (Xinhua) -- South African hospitals

will employ another 150 Cuban doctors next month to help

alleviate the shortage of physicians in the country, a spokesman

from the Ministry of Health said in Pretoria today.
</P>
<P>
Vincent Hlongwane said this would bring the number of Cuban

doctors working in South Africa to 447.
</P>
<P>
A special team has left for Cuba to test the ability of the

doctors including their English language efficiency.
</P>
<P>
The forthcoming Cuban doctors would serve in rural and

under-serviced urban areas because "there is a crying need for

doctors in those places," said Hlongwane.
</P>
<P>
While social transformation and medical changes are underway,

South Africa has been short of medical workers for years.
</P>
<P>
The medical changes, featuring dramatic cut of government

subsidy, have remarkably restrained income of the local white

doctors.
</P>
<P>
A considerable number of white doctors and nurses have either

gone abroad or shifted to private clinics in big cities to make a

good living.

<HEADLINE> Tajik Warring Parties Signs Agreement on Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The Tajik government and the

United Tajik opposition today made a breakthrough here in their

negotiations by signing an agreement on repatriation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement signed today, the Tajik government

should assume the responsibility of returning refugees and

involuntarily displaced people into social and economic life of

the country.
</P>
<P>
It also includes provision of humanitarian and financial

assistance facilitating their employment and housing, restoration

of all the rights enjoyed by the citizens of the republic.
</P>
<P>
The government said that it will not prosecute the returning

refugees and involuntarily displaced people in a criminal court

of law for their participation in the political confrontation

and civil war, in accordance with the existing laws of the

republic.
</P>
<P>
The parties decided to instruct a joint commission with

participation of representatives of local authorities and the

United Tajik opposition to visit the refugees regularly during the

implementation of the present protocol and in accordance with

a separate schedule.
</P>
<P>
The negotiations between the Tajik government and the

opposition began from January 6, and the Tajik government was

represented by the republic's Foreign Minister Talbak Nazarow

while Akbar Turjanzadeh, Deputy Chairman of League of Tajik

opposition, was present on behalf of the opposition party.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati, the U.N. special

envoy to Tajikistan Gerd Merrem and Russian Ambassador Sergei

Tretyakov and some CIS diplomats were also present at the

meeting.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides agreed on the repatriation of refugees,

other problems are yet to be agreed upon.
</P>
<P>
Iran's official news agency IRNA today quoted Turjanzadeh as

saying "the composition of the national reconciliation commission

is a stumbling block. The opposition has proposed that the

commission be composed of 40 members."
</P>
<P>
"Whereas the government representatives insist that only 10

people should make up the commission," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He said that the opposition's proposal envisaged 40 members

for the commission, 16 from the government, 16 from the

opposition and eight from the national revival pact.
</P>
<P>
"But the government representatives to the talks did not

accept the proposal," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turjanzadeh said the opposition reduced the number of the

members on the commission to 34, 40 percent of which from

the government side, 40 percent from the opposition side and

the remaining 20 percent to be decided by the leaders of the

belligerent parties in their future meetings.
</P>
<P>
But the government is willing to give a 20 to 25

percent quota to the opposition in the composition of the

national reconciliation commission, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said guaranteeing the safety of the commission members

is another problem faced by the Tehran meeting, adding that

the opposition believes that 700 of its fighters should be

based in Dushanbe to protect the commission members in

cooperation with the government troops.
</P>
<P>
But, neither the government nor the United Nations has

accepted the proposal on the grounds that the presence of

Muslim combatants would forment tension, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gerd Merrem, Special Representative of the UN Secretary-

General on Tajikistan, said at a press conference held on Sunday

that the United Nations had put forward a draft document for an

end to the civil war in Tajikistan.

Cooked rice and meat with soft drinks are supplied to the poor

fasting people at the feeding posts. Each person is fed with 200

grams of rice, a piece of meat and a cup of pineapple juice.

According to Abdikarin Guled, a project manager of African

Moslems, for the month of Ramadan, his agency runs 27 temporary

feeding posts in Mogadishu, Jowhar and other towns. And 13 of the

posts (five mosques and eight distribution centers) are in

Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> Jordan: King's Proposal Crucial for Hebron Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua)-- Jordanian Prime Minister

Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti said today that King Hussein's intense

mediation between Gaza and Israel could prove crucial for a

comprehensive deal expanding Palestinian self-rule.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti expressed hope that the executive protocol on

implementing the Israeli troop pullout from the West bank would

be drafted tonight in case a summit between Israeli Prime

Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat

takes place.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, who arrived here this morning on a lightning visit

to Egypt, made the statement to the press after conveying to

Egyptian president Hosni Mubarak a message from King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In a last ditch effort to save the Palestinian-Israeli talks,

the Jordan's King presented a new formula to the Arafat and

Netanyahu on Sunday when the U.S. efforts had failed to seal a

deal on launching the Palestinian autonomy in 80 percent of the

West Bank town of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which reportedly has been accepted by the

Palestinians and Israelis, was Mubarak's suggestion of a May 1998

deadline for the completion of Israeli redeployment from the

rural areas of West Bank, according to the Jordanian official.
</P>
<P>
"The basis of their talks was President Mubarak's suggestion

and a period of 30 days might be added and that was agreed upon,"

Kabariti said.
</P>
<P>
But he said Jordan suggested mid-1998 as a compromise between

the Israeli, American and Palestinian suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said the Jordanian monarch had the logic and the

credibility to get the Israelis and the Palestinians listen to

him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized the role of Egypt in the current

breakthrough. "We counted on the suggestions of President Hosni

Mubarak regarding fixing a final date for the redeployment in the

West Bank."
</P>
<P>
When asked if Israel would backtrack as it did, Kabariti said

he hoped that this time international pressure could make Israel

keep its commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
"The endeavors of the U.S., Europe, Egypt and the support of

the Arab world and all peace-loving nations should incite the

implementation of the agreements," he added.
</P>
<P>
When the implementation begins, he added, we will return to

the right path and restart confidence-building, which is the

basis of the peace process.
</P>
<P>
"The success of King Hussein's shuttle will be measured by the

commitment to the implementation of the accord," the Jordanian

official told reporters.

<HEADLINE> Mail Bomb Found in UN Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The acting spokesman of

the secretary-general, Fred Eckhard, confirmed early this

afternoon that a mail bomb had been found and safely detonated by

the U.N. security.
</P>
<P>
He said the bomb, which was hidden inside a greeting card, was

addressed to the Lebanese newspaper Al Hayyat, whose U.N.

correspondent is Ms. Raghida Dergham.
</P>
<P>
"The secretary-general," said Eckhard, "unreservedly condemns

this cowardly act, which is an assault on the United Nations

itself and on the principle of free expression for which the

United Nations stands."
</P>
<P>
He said, "Today's bomb threat at the United Nations, aimed at

the office of the Al Hayyat newspaper, is a reminder of the

dangerous conditions under which many journalists must work."
</P>
<P>
In a briefing held right after the bomb was cleared, Eckhard

said that it was the bombing of a greeting card to the Al Hayyat

London headquarters this morning that alerted the U.N. security.

In the morning bombing, two people were reportedly injured.
</P>
<P>
Eckhard said that in a routine search this morning, the U.N.

security spotted the suspect mail card and then called in the New

York bomb squad, who then removed and detonated it at the basement

of the headquarters.

<HEADLINE> Customs Duty May End French Food Aid to Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania's imposition of

customs duty over international food aid has annoyed the French

government which threatened to put a stop to such aid.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued here today by the French Embassy in Dar es

Salaam said part of the 5,000 tons of wheat flour, granted to the

Tanzanian government as food relief last November, are still

being held at Dar es Salaam port because the Tanzanian government

insisted on imposing duty on the aid items.
</P>
<P>
"The food would be immediately diverted to other countries

where such help is much more needed. More than 50 countries are

at present benefiting from France's generosity," said the

statement.
</P>
<P>
The tax issue created a dialogue between the ministries of

agriculture and finance. The former proposed for a tax remission

on the basis that the cost, freight and insurance value (CIF) of

the wheat flour was very high, short of which they said the flour

would not find a market because of its high price.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, the Ministry of Finance asked the Ministry

of Agriculture to sort out the value issue with the relevant

authorities, arguing that if the price of the French food was

much higher than the prevailing prices at the world market,

lowering the CIF value would be an act to force the tax level

down.
</P>
<P>
They also said toward the end of last December the CIF value

for the wheat flour was 380.22 U.S. Dollars per ton while in

other markets the value would range between 210 and 250 U.S.

Dollars per ton.

<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The South-South Conference on

Trade, Investment and Finance, at the initiative of the Group of

77 and China, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Representatives of 108 countries attended the opening ceremony

inaugurated by Costa Rican President Jose Maria Figueres.
</P>
<P>
Fernado Naranjo, minister of foreign affairs of Costa Rica,

called on developing countries to expand cooperation with a

creative spirit. Each country, big or small, has something to

learn and something to teach, he said, adding that confronted with

globalization, developing countries should think more about

South-South cooperation while not forgetting the North.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Daudi Mwakawago of Tanzania, chairman for the Group

of 77 and China for 1997, said that economic and technical

cooperation among developing countries is an urgent need. He also

urged developed countries to help the developing countries,

especially African countries, to solve the debt problem.
</P>
<P>
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan sent a message to

the conference, hoping that the Group of 77 and China will help

build a new United Nations. "Global challenges require global

solutions, and we must build a United Nations more capable of

providing genuine leadership and substantial assistance in meeting

the challenges of today and the next century," the message read.
</P>
<P>
The participants will discuss new approaches and strategies for

expansion of South-South cooperation at the three-day conference.

<HEADLINE> UN Expects World Economy to Grow Sustainably in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations has

expected that the world economy will grow by a sustainable 3

percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Growth in the developed countries will continue to be about

2.25 percent in 1997 while developing countries will see a modest

acceleration in growth from 5.7 percent in 1996 to 6 percent this

year, according to "The State of the World Economy at the Start of

1997," a just-released U.N. report.
</P>
<P>
The report noted that the world economy growth will be

unusually widespread this year. The U.N. predicts that 116 of the

137 countries being monitored by the world body will increase

output per head in 1997. Those that will not achieve this are

mostly the world's poorest countries as well as a limited number

of economies in transition.
</P>
<P>
The African GDP is forecast to grow by 4 percent for the second

straight year this year. This would mark the first time since

1979-1980 that per capita output rose in Africa for two years in a

row.
</P>
<P>
But the report said that with the boom in commodity prices

having ended in the past year and a continued shortfall in

developing assistance, many of the lower-income countries face

intensified risks of marginalization.
</P>
<P>
As for the volume of world trade growth, the U.N. report

stressed that it slipped below 6 percent in 1996 but international

financial flows were on track for a 25 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
Investor confidence has apparently overcome the tremors

experienced in 1995, according to the report. In Latin America,

net capital inflows held steady at 50 billion U.S. dollars in 1996

as increasing private investment flows in effect substitute for

the exceptional multilateral rescue packages of 1995.

<TEXT>

LUSAKA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- President Frederick Chiluba

said today that no nation in history can boast of authentic and

lasting development without the critical factor of an educated

human resource.
</P>
<P>
He made the remarks at the opening ceremony of the Ninth

Conference of the Association of African Universities (AAU) here.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said education is a process by which people acquire

knowledge, skills, values and attitudes.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, education is the true bedrock of a society, its

culture and its civilization, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called on African countries to put due premium to

human capital development.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, he emphasized cooperation and partnership

between the university, government and the wider society.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba called on African universities to equip students with

intellectual will and strength of character to deal with hardship

and inculcate in the students a willingness to embrace the

sacrifices in order to cope with the complex problems facing the

society now and in the coming century.
</P>
<P>
In this context, the graduates in agriculture, for instance,

should focus on the study of the best ways of tackling droughts

and famines in the face of the harsh climatic factors.
</P>
<P>
Attending the five-day conference are about 250

representatives from 47 African countries.
</P>
<P>
They will analyze and re-define the future roles and functions

of the African university in the rapidly changing environment of

the 21st century.

CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Sudan today urged the Arab and

African states to put an end to the attacks by Ethiopia and

Sudanese rebel forces on its southern border areas.
</P>
<P>
A press release, issued by the Sudanese Embassy here today,

said Ethiopia and the rebel forces had launched attacks since

Sunday on Kurmuk and Qissan, about 600 kilometers southeast of

the Sudanese capital of Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
"Arab and African brothers should live up to their

responsibilities in the face of such aggression that would have

grave consequences on the whole region," it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Sudanese delegate to the Arab League Ahmad

al-Kordofani today told Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdel

Meguid that Ethiopian forces, in conjunction with the Sudan

People's Liberation Army(SPLA), have invaded Sudanese territories.
</P>
<P>
He warned that the foreign invasion endangers Arab security

and Sudan's neighbors, especially Egypt.
</P>
<P>
Meguid expressed strong worries at the developments of the

situation in Southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
Sudanese troops and rebel forces have been engaged in a

military clash since Sunday after the two towns on the border

with Ethiopia fell under heavy artillery fire.
</P>
<P>
The SPLA is one of the chief oppositions against the Sudanese

government. The joint command of Sudan's Opposition Forces led by

John Garang was formed at a meeting held in Eritrea last October.
</P>
<P>
Sudan's opposition forces comprise elements from the Umma

Party, the Democratic Unionist Party, the Sudanese Coalition and

the SPLA.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian PM: King Hussein's Proposal Crucial for </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua)-- Jordanian Prime Minister Abdul

Karim Kabariti said today that King Hussein's intense mediation

between Gaza and Israel could prove crucial towards the conclusion

of a comprehensive deal on Palestinian self-rule expansion.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti expressed the hope that the executive protocol on

implementing the Israeli troop pullback from the rural areas of

the West Bank would be drafted tonight in case a summit between

Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader

Yasser Arafat takes place.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti, who arrived here this morning on a lightning visit to

Egypt, made the statement to the press after conveying to Egyptian

president Hosni Mubarak a message from King Hussein.
</P>
<P>
In a last ditch effort to save the Palestinian-Israeli talks,

the king presented a new formula to Arafat and Netanyahu on Sunday

when U.S. efforts had failed to seal a deal on the long-awaited

agreement on Israeli troops redeployment from the West Bank town

of Hebron.
</P>
<P>
The proposal, which has been reportedly accepted by the

Palestinians and Israelis, was Mubarak's suggestion of a May 1998

deadline for the completion of Israeli redeployment from the rural

areas of the West Bank, according to the Jordanian prime minister.
</P>
<P>
But he said Jordan suggested mid-1998 as a compromise between

the Israeli, American and Palestinian suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said the Jordanian monarch had the logic and the

credibility to have the Israelis and the Palestinians listen to

him.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he emphasized the role of Egypt in the current

breakthrough. "We counted on the suggestions of President Hosni

Mubarak regarding fixing a final date for the redeployment in the

West Bank."
</P>
<P>
When asked if Israel would backtrack as it did, Kabariti said

he hoped that this time international pressure could make Israel

keep its commitment to peace.
</P>
<P>
"The endeavors of the U.S., Europe, Egypt and the support of

the Arab world and all peace-loving nations should incite the

implementation of the agreements," he added.
</P>
<P>
When the implementation begins, he added, "we will return to the

right path and restart confidence-building, which is the basis of

the peace process."
</P>
<P>
"The success of King Hussein's shuttle will be measured by the

commitment to the implementation of the accord," Kabariti told

reporters.
</P>
<P>
Following the 90-minute talks with Hussein Sunday, Netanyahu

voiced confidence that the end of negotiations is in sight,

"because of the important initiative His Majesty took, we have

made considerable progress."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Arafat's advisor Nabil Abu Redinah said today the

Palestinians have accepted the Egyptian-Jordanian peace proposals

and are waiting from Israel's approval.

post-Hebron redeployment stages in accordance with the Jordanian

DAMASCUS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Vice President

Abdul-Halim Khaddam returned home this evening after concluding a

visit to Iran.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said that during the visit, Khaddam handed a

letter from Syrian President Hafez Assad to Iranian President

Hashemi Rafsanjani on the general situation in the Middle East,

the latest developments in the Arab-Israeli struggle and other

matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani entrusted Khaddam with a reply to President Assad,

in which he expressed Iran's interest in strengthening the firm

strategic relationship between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The sources added that Khaddam exchanged views while meeting

with Iranian leaders on the Middle East. The two sides discussed

several outstanding matters related to the future of the region.
</P>
<P>
In Tehran Sunday, Khaddam met with Iran's First Vice-President

Hassan Habibi on bilateral and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam was quoted as saying that as far as the views of the

two countries on regional issues were concerned, Iran and Syria

were even closer now than they had ever been.
</P>
<P>
He said "the peculiar behavior of the Zionist regime and its

plots and conspiracies in the Middle East warranted special

watchfulness by Muslim nations of the region."
</P>
<P>
Khaddam arrived here Sunday afternoon on a two-day official

visit to Tehran amid a wave of criticisms by Iranian media for

Damascus' stance towards Iran.
</P>
<P>
But the Iranian government has kept silent to avoid causing any

damages to the strategic relations between the two countries.

U.S. congressmen Tom Cambell and Donald Payne here today who have

come to acquaint themselves with the situation in the Great Lakes

region.
</P>
<P>
Museveni discussed with them matters of mutual interest

between the two countries and briefed them on the situation in

the region. The two U.S. legislators came here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed them about the economic development in Uganda

and the democratic process being taken in the country and efforts

being made to solve the current problems in the region.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said Africa is a continent which has two major

problems of structural distortions in its societies and poor

political power structure, but these problems are being solved by

the democratic forces which are emerging on the continent.
</P>
<P>
He told the U.S. guests that since his government came to

power in 1986, Uganda has registered a high degree of economic

growth and that the government is now building its capacity for

sustainable growth.
</P>
<P>
On democratization process, Museveni said the issue of what

type of democracy practised in the country is not the problem

because it is the masses who will decide on what form of

democracy they need.
</P>
<P>
A referendum will be held in three years time in Uganda to

sound out the opinion of the people on this matter, Museveni

disclosed.

<P>
LAGOS, January 13 (Xinhua) -- A plane with Nigeria's Foreign

Minister and several other notable passengers on board, had to

make an emergency return on Sunday to the airport in Lagos 15

minutes after take-off because of a fault of the aircraft.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi, Women Affairs Minister Judith

Attah, two Major-Generals and an Air Vice Marshal were among some

200 passengers aboard the Boeing 727 aircraft belonging to the

Bellview Airline of Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
The News Agency of Nigeria today quoted the pilot as saying

that he noticed a blinking light under the carriage of the plane

and had opted to return to the airport.
</P>
<P>
The blinking light means that the under-carriage does not

retract, and the pilot said he could not continue with the flight

under such circumstance.
</P>
<P>
The flight was cancelled when the fault could not be

immediately rectified.
</P>
<P>
The ministers and military chiefs later left for Abuja, the

national capital, by another plane.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's aviation authorities have been very cautious since a

Boeing 727 of the aviation development corporation crashed last

November which killed all the 143 people on board.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian government now plans to ban the importation of

aircraft above fifteen years in a bid to improve the

airworthiness of planes owned by domestic airline operators.
</P>
<P>
As about 90 percent of aircraft currently being used by

airline operators in Nigeria are over 20 years old, the

government said it would not continue to fold its hands and watch

while airlines import what at best can be described as "flying

coffins" into the country.

<HEADLINE> US Analysts See Moderate Economic Growth This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Top U.S. economists have

predicted that the U.S. economy will continue its moderate growth

this year with little acceleration in prices.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. economy will begin its seventh year of economic

expansion in 1997 growing at a modest, but largely noninflationary

pace," according to a summary of a poll released today by Blue

Chip Economic Indicators.
</P>
<P>
The consensus of the 51 Blue Chip economists forecast a 2.3

percent growth in 1997, as measured by the gross domestic product

(GDP), according to the newsletter.
</P>
<P>
The forecasters also predicted that U.S. consumer prices index

(CPI) in 1997 will rise slightly to 2.9 percent, matching the

forecast for 1996 and representing the sixth consecutive year that

the year-over-year increase in the CPI has remained below 3

percent.
</P>
<P>
"Tough domestic and international competition continues to

limit businesses ability to hike prices," survey participants

said. But they predicted the consumer prices would rise 3 percent

in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The current economic expansion is already the third longest in

U.S. post-war history.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Chip forecast suggests that overall growth will slow

during the second half of 1997 and measure just 2.1 percent in

1998. The unemployment rate for all of 1997 was forecast at an

average of 5.4 percent, same as 1996.

The survey participants represent major corporations, banks,

universities, economic forecasting services and Wall Street firms.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr

Moussa today expressed reservation about a compromise timetable

for Israeli troop pullback from the rural areas of the West Bank

and said some difficulties still face the drafting process.
</P>
<P>
Moussa made the statement after Jordanian Prime Minister

Abdul-Karim al-Kabariti briefed Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

on King Hussein's mediation between Gaza and Israel Sunday.
</P>
<P>
In reply to a question on whether what has been reached between

the Palestinians and Israelis represents a compromise solution,

Moussa gave a negative answer, saying that five or six months have

already been lost in talks with no Israeli troops redeployment

taking place in Hebron.
</P>
<P>
"At any rate, the process should not exceed May or mid-1998, to

leave room for the examination of other issues of the interim

phase," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, Moussa said that the agreement Sunday night was

reached on carrying out the first stage of redeployment before

March 1, which falls short of the commitment to ending the second

and third phases of redeployment within 12 months.
</P>
<P>
The king presented a new formula to Israeli Prime Minister

Binyamin Netanyahu and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat on

launching Palestinian autonomy in 80 percent of Hebron and the

rural areas of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
Under the new compromise, the first Israeli pullback is to be

carried out by February 28, the second one eight months later,

and the third no later than August 31, 1998.
</P>
<P>
Kabariti said he hoped the executive protocol on implementing

the Israeli troop pullback from the rural areas of the West bank

would be drafted tonight in case a summit between Arafat and

Netanyahu takes place.
</P>
<P>
Jordan suggested mid-1998 as a compromise between the Israeli,

American and Palestinian suggestions.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian and Israeli negotiators resumed talks in

Jerusalem today to draft arrangements in the post-Hebron

redeployment stages in accordance with Jordanian compromise

agreement.
</P>
<P>
Egypt and Jordan, the only two Arab countries that made peace

with the Jewish state, have played a mediating role in the

Palestinian-Israeli negotiations.

ANKARA, January 13 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Chief of General Staff

Ismail Hakki Karadayi today described Cyprus' purchase of S-300

missiles as a provocation, according to reports reaching here

from northern Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
General Karadayi, who arrived today in northern Cyprus for a

two-day visit, told reporters that no one should call a missile

with a range of 150 kilometers a defensive weapon.
</P>
<P>
"This (Cyprus' missile deal) is unacceptable and it cannot be

taken slightly," Karadayi said.
</P>
<P>
Karadayi's visit came when a crisis arose on the divided

island due to Cyprus' purchase of Russian-made surface-to-air

missiles, which has triggered Ankara's military strike warning.
</P>
<P>
Besides talks with the northern Cyprus' officials, Karadayi is

 also to inspect some 35,000 Turkish troops stationed there since

 Turkey's armed forces landed on the island in 1974 after a coup

seeking union with Greece by some Greek Cypriots.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus government has claimed that it will go ahead with

its defense program although Turkey has threatened to strike at

the surface-to-air missiles if they are deployed.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus Defense Minister Costas Eliades today called Karadayi's

 visit to northern Cyprus another attempt on the part of Turkey

to create tension on the divided island.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's warning of military strike against Cyprus has drawn

criticism from the United States.
</P>
<P>
At present, the Cyprus government is also in close contact

with Greece to discuss the crisis on the island as a result of

the missile deal.
