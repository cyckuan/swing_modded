PEREZ SHUTS OUT GIANTS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Kevin Malone says he doesn't need to go out and
find an ace this winter. Carlos Perez agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Malone, the Dodgers' new general manager, says he is comfortable
with five quality pitchers who will keep him out of the free-agent
bidding for Kevin Brown or Randy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Perez says Malone already has his No. 1 starter and continued to
prove it Sunday by defeating the San Francisco Giants 1-0 for his
fourth consecutive complete-game victory.
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he learned a lot about being an ace watching Pedro
Martinez win a Cy Young Award last year when the two were teammates
in Montreal. He learned how to pitch inside, challenge hitters and
go deep into a game when the bullpen needed a rest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like everyone to know that when they give me the ball, they
are getting nine innings out of me,'' said Perez, who has seven
complete games. ``The next time I pitch I am going to throw another
nine.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez (11-13) was facing the same Giants that went through six
Dodgers pitchers and scored 18 runs the day before. Sunday, no
relief pitchers even got up to get loose.
</P>
<P>
   The Giants are clinging to faint playoff hopes and were given a
boost with eight innings of two-hit pitching by left-hander Shawn
Estes, last year's 19-game winner who has been derailed most of the
season with shoulder problems.
</P>
<P>
   Estes' only mistake came two batters into the game on a homer by
Trenidad Hubbard that stood alone on the scoreboard for nine long
innings.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of 40,184 at 3Com Park desperately wanted a victory,
but instead settled for a classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a great baseball game,'' Estes said. ``The guy just
outpitched me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the Giants are four games behind the New York Mets for the
National League wild-card spot with seven to play. The Mets, who
lead the Chicago Cubs by a game, have five games left.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were eliminated Friday night and proved it by
getting crushed Saturday. But as the next-day pitcher, Perez
charted the game and learned a few things. He saw that Dodgers
starter Ismael Valdes never came inside with a fastball that is
much better than his own.
</P>
<P>
   And he thought the Giants needed to pay for beating the Dodgers
so badly.
</P>
<P>
   ``They treated us like a minor-league team,'' said Perez, who
did not win in his first six starts after joining the Dodgers on
Aug. 1. ``I wanted to prove we are still a quality team.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with so little margin for error, Perez was rarely
challenged Sunday. The Giants didn't get a runner to third until
the eighth, when Brian Johnson opened with a triple to right over
the head of Raul Mondesi.
</P>
<P>
   But Perez retired pinch hitter Marvin Benard on an infield out,
walked Ellis Burks, then got Bill Mueller to ground into an
inning-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   Perez, who allowed four hits and three walks, broke into a dance
that often infuriates opposing teams. But Malone, who was Perez's
GM in Montreal, said he would never want to curb the left-hander's
emotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was like that in '95 when he broke in, and I told him he
doesn't want to lose who he is,'' Malone said. ``But I don't need
him to be a No. 1 pitcher. My view here is that five quality
starters will get the job done with this team next season.''
</P>
<P>
   As Perez was speaking after the game, Valdes poked his head past
the crowd and gave him a high five. Valdes made 86 pitches Saturday
and never got out of the third inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He needed to come inside and he never did,'' said Perez, who
made 122 pitches Sunday. ``He has great talent, but he needs to let
the hitters know who is in charge.''
</P>
<P>
   Perez said he learned that watching Martinez, who took his Cy
Young to Boston, where he became a $75 million pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me when you are the ace of the staff, you are going to
get a lot of people watching your every move,'' Perez said. ``The
fans, the media, even your teammates. But he said that is where you
want to be as a pitcher. You want the responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers haven't had that since Pedro Martinez's brother
Ramon was lost for the season in early June with a torn rotator
cuff. Chan Ho Park has won his last three starts and 13 overall.
Brian Bohanon and Dave Mlicki have pitched well since coming over
from the Mets. But there hasn't been that one guy to take the ball
in big games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a while to get comfortable here,'' Perez said. ``But
now everything is great.'' &QL;

HUBBARD WON'T BE FOOLED AGAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trenidad Hubbard stopped worrying about next
year long ago.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't step to the plate wondering if he needs a hit to
extend his major-league career. And Hubbard knows that hitting a
game-winning home run like the one Sunday that helped the Dodgers
beat Shawn Estes and the San Francisco Giants 1-0 isn't any
guarantee for the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, all that matters is doing well in each at-bat or
learning something if I don't,'' said Hubbard, who is playing with
his fourth team in three years. ``I hit an inside fastball that he
struck me out on when we played them in L.A. (Sept. 4). I guess he
thought he could get me again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard was just the second batter of the game when he went deep
on Estes' 3-2 fastball. But the run stood up when Carlos Perez
pitched nine scoreless innings for his fourth consecutive complete
game.
</P>
<P>
   Hubbard, 32, finished the game 1 for 3 and is hitting .311 (38
for 122) in his last 31 starts. Overall, he is batting .299 (59 for
197) in 89 games with a career-high seven homers. Before this year,
he had never hit more than three in parts of four seasons with
Cleveland, San Francisco and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   After Raul Mondesi asked to return to right field three weeks
ago, Hubbard has taken over in center, but knows his future is as a
role player.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hard work and preparation are the keys to success whether it
is as a starter or bench player,'' Hubbard said. ``Preparation is
remembering what a pitcher did against you the last time and making
the adjustment.''
</P>
<P>
   Estes best: Hubbard wasn't the only one to show improvement
since the Dodgers-Giants series earlier this month. Estes, who
missed a month with a sore left shoulder, looked Sunday like the
pitcher who won 19 games for the Giants last season.
</P>
<P>
   Estes (7-12) allowed just one hit after Hubbard's homer, a
one-out single to Eric Karros in the seventh that was wiped out on
a double play. Estes also walked Mondesi to open the second, but
Mark Grudzielanek grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his performance, Estes lost his fifth consecutive start.
In his previous three appearances, he had a 14.81 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   Quick hits: The Dodgers are off today. It also is Tom Lasorda's
71st birthday.

SPORTS COLUMN: AN AWESOME PERFECTIONIST WITH THE WILL OF A MULE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also BBA-RIBKEN)  
(lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Exhausted and emotionally drained, Cal Ripken Jr.
fell into a deep slump in the days after breaking Lou Gehrig's
consecutive-game record of 2,130 games on Sept. 6, 1995. He was a
national icon, a living symbol of dedication to excellence who
graced magazine covers and television screens, but that did not
help him when he was trying to hit fastballs.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour after an afternoon game in Detroit two weeks
later, Ripken carried a bucket of balls and a batting tee from the
visitors' clubhouse out to the empty Tiger Stadium field. He set
the tee on home plate, placed a ball on the tee and drove it to the
outfield. He emptied the bucket, walked around the field alone and
gathered the balls. And then he repeated the exercise.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken emerged from his slump two days later, and I was among
those watching, covering the Orioles for The Baltimore Sun. I was
in awe of Ripken's will and intelligent play and achievement; and
sometimes I found his allegiance to his own agenda to be appalling.
Like Joe DiMaggio, Ripken is and will forever be leery of the news
media, for it represents the only threat to his image, which he
protects zealously; I believe he ended his streak at 2,632
consecutive games last night because the trickle of criticism
regarding his motives was threatening to become a flood, and the
continuation of the streak had become blatantly superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   But there are unchallenged truths about Ripken: He always played
hard. He always played to win. He always played, in spite of
injuries minor and major. Baseball is lucky to have him.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's record became an albatross for the Orioles the last
three seasons, and his stubborness added to the burden. Ripken's
range at shortstop decreased markedly in 1996 and when Orioles
executives floated the idea of shifting him to third base, he
declared that anyone who thought his ability had lessened knew
nothing about baseball. When Davey Johnson, his former manager,
moved Ripken to third base for a trial period that July, Ripken
stopped speaking to his replacement, Manny Alexander.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken maintained that his streak was always at the mercy of his
manager. But he steadfastly refused to endorse any suggestion of
change, and his managers knew that taking him out of the lineup
would invite the wrath of a community devoted to the longtime
Oriole.
</P>
<P>
   He has stayed in separate hotels and exploited the privileges
inherent in being the city's favorite son. More than a month into
Phil Regan's only year as manager of the Orioles, in 1995, Regan
discovered that Ripken had been calling pitches from shortstop,
without telling Regan. Ripken injured his back in 1997, and even as
his production suffered and team officials wondered if he needed
rest, they did not know his true condition; Ripken went to his own
doctor. Earlier this season, Ripken responded testily to columnists
calling for him to end his streak by saying that considering his
age, his production was pretty good. In fact, the Orioles have the
worst third base production in the American League this season.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's autonomy gradually came to infect the rest of the
organization, with some veteran teammates openly resenting the
special treatment afforded him and others ignoring team rules. The
failure to run out ground balls has become an Orioles epidemic in
recent years, and the strong consensus of the team's management has
been that only Ripken _ who always plays hard _ held the power and
authority in the clubhouse to change the Orioles' often emotionless
approach. Ripken refused to get involved, however, refused to lead;
at the end he was a master of passive resistance. A man cannot play
in every game for more than 16 years without possessing the will of
a mule. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But ultimately, Ripken will be remembered not for his role in
some disappointing Baltimore teams but for his devotion to
excellence and his invaluable contribution to baseball at a time
when the game desperately needed him. Ripken learned how to play
baseball from his father, Cal Ripken Sr., in a very specific and
regimented manner requiring endless hours of practice. The Oriole
way, as it is known in these parts.
</P>
<P>
   Never fleet, Ripken became a Gold Glove-caliber shortstop by
learning the tendencies of opposing batters, anticipating where
they would hit the ball. Never a natural hitter, Ripken has
tinkered constantly with his stance, fighting through slumps and
minor injuries to become the greatest offensive shortstop in the
annals of the game, twice winning Most Valuable Player awards. He
needs 127 more hits to reach 3,000 for his career, and 16 more home
runs to reach 400.
</P>
<P>
   The players' strike of 1994 led to the cancellation of the World
Series that fall, and baseball owners furthered compromised the
credibility of the sport the following spring by attempting to use
replacement players. For baseball, it was the Dark Ages.
</P>
<P>
   But play resumed, and Ripken closed on Gehrig's record,
representing only the good in baseball, and he included fans along
the way. After games, he sometimes sat on the Orioles' dugout here
and signed autographs for more than two hours, thousands and
thousands of them. He paused to chat and engage in conversation and
make everyone _ especially kids _ feel as if they were part of
something special. On the emotional night he broke Gehrig's record,
he circled the park and fans reached out to him, and Ripken reached
back.
</P>
<P>
   With a week left in that season, I left the press box at 1 a.m.
at the same time Ripken began pulling away from the ball park in
his truck. Three fans waited for him in the dark, holding
baseballs. Ripken stopped and gabbed and signed, with the power of
healing that he employed with greater effectiveness than anyone
since another Baltimore son, known as The Babe.

THE CHALLENGER: SCHUMER ASSAILS D'AMATO ON GUN CONTROL

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Rep. Charles Schumer fiercely criticized Sen. Alfonse
D'Amato's voting record on gun control Sunday, saying the
Republican incumbent was more interested in collecting donations
from the National Rifle Association than protecting the lives of
New Yorkers.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer, a Democrat from Brooklyn, who is hoping to unseat
D'Amato in November, held a news conference in City Hall Park to
proclaim that D'Amato's record on gun control was ``one of the
worst in the whole Senate.'' He was surrounded by relatives of
shooting victims who thanked him for sponsoring the Brady bill,
which required background checks and waiting periods for handgun
buyers in most states.
</P>
<P>
   ``On gun control, the issue and the contrast of who sides with
working families and who sides with the special interests couldn't
be clearer,'' Schumer said. ``I have made it one of my life's works
to prevent more people from being behind me like this because
they've lost a loved one to gun violence.''
</P>
<P>
   D'Amato voted against the Brady bill and the federal assault
weapons ban, which outlawed the sale of 19 types of semiautomatic
weapons. Schumer accused him of protecting the interests of the
National Rifle Association, which he said has contributed $36,000
to D'Amato during his 18 years in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can understand when senators from Mississippi vote against
gun control,'' Schumer said. ``After all, there's a gun culture
there. But a senator from New York constantly siding against gun
control, with the National Rifle Association? We are here to ask Al
D'Amato why he continually does that.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for D'Amato, who was making a campaign swing through
upstate cities Sunday, countered that D'Amato was in fact tougher
on crime than his Democratic opponent. ``Chuck Schumer is trying to
hide his liberal record on crime,'' the spokesman, Harvey
Valentine, said. ``The fact is, Al D'Amato passed legislation in
the Senate for mandatory sentences for criminals who commit crimes
with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   That proposal never became law because it did not pass in
Congress, where Schumer opposed it, Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has railed against D'Amato every day since last Tuesday,
when he won the Democratic primary. D'Amato has complained about
the attacks in recent days, but Schumer said Sunday that he had no
plans to scale them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that Al D'Amato criticizing my comments on him in
this regard is like the British criticizing the patriots who fired
back at Bunker Hill,'' Schumer said. ``Boy, oh boy, let me tell Al
D'Amato: You've made every past campaign a one-sided campaign where
you are attacking your opponents viciously and nastily, and they
haven't answered back.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Chuck Schumer is going to answer back every day.''

   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Two games into this season of their
rebirth, the Cowboys already stand at a crossroads.
</P>
<P>
   One might call it the intersection of Hope and Despair. The
defense looks shattered. Troy Aikman is broken.
</P>
<P>
   But all may not be lost. Yet.
</P>
<P>
   Not if one is a student of geography and can recognize the
Cowboys' place as smack in the middle of the NFC East, which is to
mediocrity what the Grand Canyon is to holes in the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Little-used Jason Garrett begins his tenure as Dallas' starting
quarterback for the next month, maybe two, while Aikman recovers
from a broken left collarbone suffered last week in Denver. And
there could be hope. Really.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the most obvious difference between Aikman and
Garrett _ the former has led the Cowboys to three Super Bowl
titles, and the latter will be making his third NFL start.
</P>
<P>
   What is important to remember is where Garrett will be making
that start _ in Giants Stadium against the Giants, who are not
exactly playing very big these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the Giants won the NFC East title a year ago. But that is
only because the league rules say somebody has to win and because
the listing ship that had been the Cowboys' own personal Titanic
under former head coach Barry Switzer finally slipped beneath the
waves.
</P>
<P>
   So what if Garrett _ who is actually older than Aikman _ is
greener than an unripe banana? He is not dueling with one of the
great ones in the Giants' Danny Kanell.
</P>
<P>
   Consider this statistic about the NFC East: Back in the 1993
season, the five starting quarterbacks for Week 3 play _ Aikman,
Phil Simms (Giants), Randall Cunningham (Eagles), Mark Rypien
(Redskins) and Steve Beuerlein (Cardinals) _ had 374 career starts
tucked under their belts. This year in Week 3, Garrett, Kanell,
Bobby Hoying, Trent Green and Jake Plummer have a total of 33
starts.
</P>
<P>
   Then consider this stat about the NFC East teams in Week 2 of
this season: They all lost, by a combined score of 157-76.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be true that the Cowboys' 42-23 thumping by the
Broncos was thorough, all that it definitely proves at the moment
is that new head coach Chan Gailey's team is not ready to compete
with the defending Super Bowl champs. But nobody in the NFC East is
wearing the jewelry of a title holder.
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Michael Irvin had his head hung low at the thought
of playing without Aikman against the Giants. Offensive lineman
Nate Newton talked of being a rudderless ship.
</P>
<P>
   But because of nothing more than the miserable neighborhood in
which they reside, the Cowboys' season does not have to be over
before it could begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is definitely a very big blow for our team, no
question,'' said owner Jerry Jones. ``I'd love to be heading into
this game with Troy leading our offense. But I really do have
confidence that we can win with Jason Garrett.''
</P>
<P>
   That will, of course, happen only if the Cowboys can find a way
to plug the holes that were wide enough for Terrell Davis and a
fleet of tractor trailers to run through last week in Denver.
Assuming that not every team in the league has a Davis in its
backfield, maybe that's possible.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for the Cowboys to have hope is that their
fourth-place schedule _ a souvenir from last year's 6-10 disaster _
does not serve them up a diet of juggernauts in the coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Following tonight's clash with the Giants, Dallas plays its next
five games against Oakland, Washington, Carolina, Chicago and
Philadelphia, which are a combined 1-13 on the season. The lone win
belongs to the Raiders, who are still as lost in the '90s as Al
Davis' wardrobe. That is hardly a murderer's row.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, if Garrett can stay away from costly mistakes, if Irvin
and Emmitt Smith can help him out by making big plays, if the
defense can just put up a passable effort, it is not inconceivable
that the Cowboys could tiptoe through that stretch with a 3-3
record. That would get them to the halfway point in the schedule
with a 4-4 mark, and it's possible Aikman would be ready to return
by then, if he isn't already back. Standing at .500, the Cowboys
would quite likely be in striking distance of first in the NFC
East. Heck, that might even be good enough to have them all alone
in the top spot.
</P>
<P>
   First things first. That means taking care of the Giants, and to
do that means taking care of Garrett with a more controlled, more
conservative offense. It also means filling the gaping holes in a
leaky defense, or whatever problems come from missing Aikman will
barely be noticed.

the Senate for mandatory sentences for criminals who commit crimes
with guns.''
</P>
<P>
   That proposal never became law because it did not pass in
Congress, where Schumer opposed it, Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   Schumer has railed against D'Amato every day since last Tuesday,
when he won the Democratic primary. D'Amato has complained about
the attacks in recent days, but Schumer said Sunday that he had no
plans to scale them back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that Al D'Amato criticizing my comments on him in
this regard is like the British criticizing the patriots who fired
back at Bunker Hill,'' Schumer said. ``Boy, oh boy, let me tell Al
D'Amato: You've made every past campaign a one-sided campaign where
you are attacking your opponents viciously and nastily, and they
haven't answered back.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Chuck Schumer is going to answer back every day.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
PITTSBURGH _ It was Sunday, so naturally Jeff Bagwell was feeling
thankful.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Thank God Richard Hidalgo was here,'' Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   It was nice of Shane Reynolds to show up, too.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo hit a pair of solo homers, and Reynolds pitched seven
resilient shutout innings in the Astros' 2-0 victory over the
Pittsburgh Pirates at Three Rivers Stadium. Jay Powell pitched a
scoreless eighth, and closer Billy Wagner worked the ninth for his
30th save.
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo's sixth and seventh homers accounted for two of the
Astros' seven hits, only five of which came against Pirates starter
Jason Schmidt, who didn't get enough help from his offense to
overcome his two mistakes to the Astros' rookie center fielder.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched a good game,'' Hidalgo, who raised his batting
average to .291, said of Schmidt. ``He only made two bad pitches,
and I was ready for them. I was just able to hit those balls hard
and get two home runs.''
</P>
<P>
   The win was No. 46 for the Astros on the road _ second-best in
the National League behind Atlanta _ and was their 99th overall. It
also pushed Reynolds one victory closer to becoming the first
Astros pitcher to win 20 games since Mike Scott in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's victory might have tested Reynolds' guile more than any
of the previous 18. The string of zeros across the scoreboard told
only half the story. The veteran righthander spent most of the
afternoon pitching around trouble and working out of jams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't feel like they were hitting the ball hard against
Shane,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said. ``But they sure had an
awful lot of baserunners.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, 11 of the 29 batters who faced Reynolds (19-8) reached
base. The Pirates advanced a runner into scoring position in each
of the first five innings and had runners in scoring position with
fewer than two outs in four of those innings. Reynolds' only 1-2-3
inning came in the sixth, but he faced more traffic on the bases in
the seventh, when the Pirates stranded two of the nine runners they
left on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some luck going today as far as being able to pitch out
of some jams,'' said Reynolds, who matched Darryl Kile's
team-leading victory total of a year ago. ``Sometimes, part of
pitching is being able to get key outs to get out of jams.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't have my best stuff, but you're not always going to
have your best stuff. A few times, it seemed like they were looking
for my off-speed stuff. You have to give the Pirates some credit,
too. They've got a bunch of good hitters who are young, and they're
out there swinging. Plus, they're fast, so if you don't get to some
balls in a hurry, they're going to beat them out.''
</P>
<P>
   An indication Reynolds wasn't working with his ``A'' material
was the fact he struck out only four batters. The Pirates had 10
hits in the game, all against Reynolds.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you give up 10 hits and still pitch seven shutout
innings, that's pitching,'' Bagwell said. ``Shane pitched a heck of
a game, and we needed it, because Schmidt is tough. I read
somewhere that he said he doesn't like to face us, but I sure don't
ever remember beating him up.''
</P>
<P>
   With the exception of a deadly 1-2 punch by Hidalgo, the Astros
didn't put any serious nicks on Schmidt (11-13) this time, either.
Not counting Hidalgo, only two Astros reached second base _ on
leadoff doubles by Bagwell in the seventh and Derek Bell in the
ninth off Pirates reliever Mike Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Richard was about the only thing we had going on offense, but
that was all it took,'' Dierker said. ``After his second home run,
the guys in the dugout were saying, `When is Richard up again?' He
really gave us a lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Hidalgo, who also had a two-homer game against the Pirates on
Aug. 30, hit a first-pitch fastball into the left-field seats in
the first inning and a 3-1 heater far beyond the center-field fence
in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt really good,'' Hidalgo said. ``As soon as I hit those
balls, I knew they were gone. I was seeing his breaking pitches
good and laying off them so that I could try to get the fastball. I
was looking for the fastball both times, and that's what I got.''
</P>
<P>
   Reynolds, who threw 97 pitches, fell two innings shy of his
second shutout of the season. He wanted to finish the game, but
Dierker decided to call on his bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally, I won't take a guy out of a shutout,'' Dierker said.
``I felt he had enough left to finish the game, and I was actually
torn about what to do. But he was close to 100 pitches, and I
didn't want to take any chances.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell and Wagner each recorded a walk and a strikeout in his
inning. Wagner erased his walk with a game-ending double play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't worried about the walk, because my pitches were
moving a lot,'' said Wagner, who had given up homers in each of his
two previous outings. ``A lot of times, you walk a guy and then
there comes the gopher ball. But it was obvious to me that they
were taking (my fastball) all the way. All I had to do was throw it
right down the middle.''

 c. 1998, Houston Chronicle  
FORT WORTH _ In the summer of 1983, John Paul Jr. was a 23-year-old
rookie in Indy-car racing who ran down Rick Mears on the final lap
to win the Michigan 500.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His future appeared bright, but personal problems caused that
outlook to change, and it has taken Paul 15 years to get back to
Victory Lane. Paul was the surprise winner Sunday in the inaugural
Lone Star 500, a race in which the key to winning was having tires
that could survive the 95-degree heat at Texas Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been a long 15 years,'' Paul said. ``I just thank God
for this opportunity, my wife and kids for standing by me, and
(team owner) Jonathan Byrd for this car. Today, it was just
awesome. I'm as fresh as a daisy. I'm ready to go 300 more laps.
The team did a tremendous job today.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul, who drives the VisionAire G-Force Aurora, took the lead
for good with 16 laps to go when the three drivers in front of him
_ Jeff Ward, Roberto Guerrero and Buddy Lazier _ all had to stop
for fuel.
</P>
<P>
   An announced crowd of 81,000 watched Paul move up from fourth to
first, and Robby Unser moved up from fifth to second. But it was
questionable whether they had enough fuel to make it to the end
before a caution flag with 11 laps to go enabled both cars to stay
in front until the checkered flag. Paul finished 1.57 seconds ahead
of Unser.
</P>
<P>
   It was an emotional day for Paul, who has made a long climb back
to respectability after a difficult period in the mid-1980s. He
spent 28 months in prison after being convicted of drug trafficking
in 1985. People close to Paul say he was a victim of his father,
John Paul Sr., who is serving a 25-year sentence for drug smuggling
and attempted murder.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those things are in the past,'' said Paul, who won
$122,500 for the victory. ``I'm just glad to have these chances
again. I expect good things to happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Some good things happened Sunday to IRL points leader and
Houston resident Kenny Brack, who finished fifth in the Power Team
Dallara/Aurora to extend his lead with one race to go.
</P>
<P>
   With 55 points available for the final IRL race at Las Vegas on
Oct. 11, Brack has a 31-point lead over defending IRL champion Tony
Stewart and a 41-point lead over Davey Hamilton. The IRL Pep Boys
champion earns a $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart believes his chances at that prize ended Sunday. Stewart
had the lead after the first 60 laps, but he was out of the race 20
laps later when he blew an engine. An angry Stewart was asked by a
television pit reporter what he thought happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just gave away a million dollars, I guess,'' Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   A.J. Foyt Racing teammates Brack and Billy Boat combined to take
home the $150,000 Texas Two-Step bonus by scoring the most IRL
point for the two TMS races this year.
</P>
<P>
   Boat, who won the race at TMS in June, finished 14th Sunday and
was 46 laps down at the end after returning from a crash caused by
a cut tire, but it was good enough to earn the $100,000 bonus and a
handmade pair of cowboy boots. Brack, who finished third in June,
earned $50,000 as the runner-up in the promotion.
</P>
<P>
   But Foyt wasn't thinking about the bonus money during the race
when both of his cars were among several teams that had problems
with their Goodyear tires.
</P>
<P>
   Boat brushed the wall on the backstretch when his right rear
tire went down, which was a theme for the day. At least half of the
field had to make unscheduled pit stops because of problems with
Goodyear tires, but the cars on Firestone tires didn't have the
same problem. Goodyear was using a tire with slight changes for
this race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them this wasn't a good tire, and I didn't recommend
it,'' Foyt said after Boat's accident. `` I can't talk about it
right now because I'm too damn mad.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt was so upset that he hunted down a Goodyear representative
during the race and was seen pointing his finger in the official's
face.
</P>
<P>
   Two drivers with Goodyear tires _ Dave Steele and Davey Hamilton
_ had tires explode off their cars on the frontstretch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're disappointed with the tire performance
today,'' said Todd Carpenter, Goodyear's lead engineer on the IRL
circuit. ``The track temperature was over 140 degrees, which
diminished the tire's ability to resist cuts.''
</P>
<P>
   Tire problems and accidents left only 13 of 28 cars running on
the 1.5-mile quad-oval at the end, and only four drivers were on
the lead lap.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Paul and Unser, Jeff Ward and Roberto Guerrero were
the other two drivers on the lead lap at the end. It was a
career-best finish for Unser, the son of three-time Indy 500
champion Bobby Unser.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike most guys (on Goodyear tires), we didn't have any tire
problems,'' Unser said. ``We fought a push all day, but that may
have kept our tires in good shape.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO, N.Y. _ In his first major swing of the general election
campaign, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato barnstormed across the
Republican-friendly reaches of northern New York state Sunday,
repeatedly accusing his Democratic opponent, Rep. Charles Schumer
from Brooklyn, of being blithely indifferent to the needs of
upstate residents.
</P>
<P>
   The whirlwind six-hour trip brought D'Amato, a Republican
seeking his fourth term, to the state's largest upstate cities _
Albany, Syracuse, Rochester and Buffalo _ and provided a television
backdrop for his unusually blunt appeal to the regional resentments
that have defined state politics for decades.
</P>
<P>
   Echoing the television advertisements with which he and the
state Republican Party have saturated the airwaves in recent days,
D'Amato derisively referred to Schumer as a ``Brooklyn liberal''
and lambasted him for having once quipped that ``the West starts on
the other side of the Hudson River.'' Schumer's aides said the
remark was a joking reference to his friend and former roommate,
Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe he thinks that's funny,'' D'Amato said at a news
conference at Buffalo International Airport Sunday afternoon. ``But
take a look at his votes. In his votes, he has demonstrated a
pattern of not only indifference, not only of negligence, but
indeed of outright damage to upstate New York.''
</P>
<P>
   Those damaging votes, according to D'Amato, included Schumer's
support in Congress for reducing price supports for dairy farmers
and for increasing federal gasoline taxes, and in the state
Assembly two decades ago for establishing a state property tax.
D'Amato contended that since many Brooklyn residents do not own
homes or cars, the taxes Schumer voted for would have fallen
disproportionately on upstate residents.
</P>
<P>
   While D'Amato was touring upstate, Schumer took to the steps of
City Hall in New York City to criticize D'Amato's opposition to gun
control. Asked about the senator's criticisms, Schumer returned to
a core theme of his campaign: that D'Amato has been in office for
too long, an attack the Republicans used effectively upstate
against Gov. Mario Cuomo four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would ask what kinds of concrete things Al D'Amato has done
for upstate,'' Schumer said. ``He's supposed to be the pothole
senator. But upstate New York is one of the three regions in the
entire country that has lost jobs. Al D'Amato has been there 18
years. He's utterly failed in helping upstate New York. And people
in upstate New York, wherever I go, are looking for a change.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer's campaign also faxed to reporters information on
D'Amato's record indicating that he had allowed property taxes to
rise in the town of Hempstead, on Long Island, during the 1970s,
when he was town supervisor there, and had voted repeatedly in the
Senate to raise federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Though D'Amato's news conferences were filled mainly with
attacks on Schumer, he did refer to federal aid that he claimed to
have directed to upstate communities, including aid for airport
renovations in Buffalo, a bridge over the Gov. Thomas E. Dewey
Thruway in Schenectady and improvements at the Albany rail station.
</P>
<P>
   The harsh tone of both candidates' remarks Sunday was in keeping
with the negative tenor that has dominated this still-young race
and provided new evidence that it is likely to be a bare-knuckles
affair down to the wire, much like the 1992 race in which D'Amato
defeated Robert Abrams, then the state attorney general, by a
single percentage point.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Democratic politicians said D'Amato's upstate strategy indicated
that he was concerned about the region's lagging economy and
perceived a softening of his support there. ``This is what he does
when he's in trouble: he tries to divide,'' said Josh Isay,
Schumer's campaign manager.
</P>
<P>
   But Republicans said D'Amato was simply playing a classic
Republican card, one that might work especially well this year
because of President Clinton's problems. Many strategists in both
parties say Democratic turnout in places like New York City may be
particularly low this year because party stalwarts are demoralized
by the inquiry into the president's relationship with Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The intangibles are looking good for D'Amato,'' said Anthony
H. Gioia, a Buffalo businessman and fund-raiser for the senator.
``He's got a popular governor at the top of the ticket to bring out
Republicans and the president's troubles keeping Democrats at
home.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts said D'Amato's efforts to stoke regional
frictions so early was extraordinary. But they said his strategy
was not surprising since D'Amato's chances of re-election depend on
overcoming New York City's strongly Democratic vote with heavy
Republican support in the north.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: VALLONE STRESSES GOVERNOR'S TIES TO D'AMATO 
</HEADLINE>
  (DUPLICATION WARNING: Also filed in category code ``a.'') 
(With NY-CAMPAIGN-DAMATO; see also NY-PATAKI-AD and

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   This 30-second ad for the campaign of Peter Vallone, the New
York City Council speaker, began broadcasting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Doak, Carrier &AMP; O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with a photo of Pataki next to an
image of a the ad attacking Vallone. The words ``Pataki negative
ad'' flash on the screen above the words ``George Pataki is
slinging mud.'' The ad then shows Vallone talking to constituents.
Then it shows photos of Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato with the
words ``hand-picked by Al D'Amato'' and cuts to the photo of Pataki
flanked by newspaper headlines unflattering to his administration.
The ad ends with an image of Pataki and D'Amato and the words ``so
far right, they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``George Pataki is slinging mud, trying to smear
Peter Vallone on taxes. But Pataki doesn't mention that many of the
votes were to pay for more cops and improve education. And that
Vallone voted to cut taxes more often than raise them. George
Pataki. Hand-picked by Al D'Amato and backed by his right-wing
organization. A man who cut education three years in a row. An
administration under federal investigation for selling state
contracts. A governor who vetoed funds for breast cancer. Pataki
and D'Amato. So far right, they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The contention that some of Vallone's tax votes were
for police and schools is correct. Whether Vallone voted more often
to cut taxes than to raise them is irrelevant, since, as the City
Council's leader, he can prevent measures from coming to a vote.
The ad's claim that Pataki ``cut education three years in a row''
is misleading, but the truth is no more beneficial to Pataki. He
who tried to reduce education spending, but most of the cuts were
beaten back by the Legislature. Education spending in some areas
declined, but overall it continued to grow. Pataki did veto a
breast cancer education project this year, one of 1,300 budget
items he vetoed. To say that the administration is under
investigation ``for selling state contracts'' prematurely presumes
guilt, and a direct connection, to contract awards by the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The ad shows the Vallone camp's ability to turn
around in short order a response to an attack. And it reiterates
two of his favorite themes: Pataki's close ties to D'Amato, who is
much less popular than his former protege; and the claim that
Pataki is untrustworthy. But Vallone, with far less money than
Pataki has, cannot hope to go toe-to-toe for very long in this kind
of negative, high-decibel campaigning.

   This 30-second ad for the campaign of Peter Vallone, the New
York City Council speaker, began broadcasting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Doak, Carrier &AMP; O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with a photo of Pataki next to an
image of a the ad attacking Vallone. The words ``Pataki negative
ad'' flash on the screen above the words ``George Pataki is
slinging mud.'' The ad then shows Vallone talking to constituents.
Then it shows photos of Pataki and Sen. Alfonse D'Amato with the
words ``hand-picked by Al D'Amato'' and cuts to the photo of Pataki
flanked by newspaper headlines unflattering to his administration.
The ad ends with an image of Pataki and D'Amato and the words ``so
far right, they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``George Pataki is slinging mud, trying to smear
Peter Vallone on taxes. But Pataki doesn't mention that many of the
votes were to pay for more cops and improve education. And that
Vallone voted to cut taxes more often than raise them. George
Pataki. Hand-picked by Al D'Amato and backed by his right-wing
organization. A man who cut education three years in a row. An
administration under federal investigation for selling state
contracts. A governor who vetoed funds for breast cancer. Pataki
and D'Amato. So far right, they're wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: The contention that some of Vallone's tax votes were
for police and schools is correct. Whether Vallone voted more often
to cut taxes than to raise them is irrelevant, since, as the City
Council's leader, he can prevent measures from coming to a vote.
The ad's claim that Pataki ``cut education three years in a row''
is misleading, but the truth is no more beneficial to Pataki. He
who tried to reduce education spending, but most of the cuts were
beaten back by the Legislature. Education spending in some areas
declined, but overall it continued to grow. Pataki did veto a
breast cancer education project this year, one of 1,300 budget
items he vetoed. To say that the administration is under
investigation ``for selling state contracts'' prematurely presumes
guilt, and a direct connection, to contract awards by the
Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: The ad shows the Vallone camp's ability to turn
around in short order a response to an attack. And it reiterates
two of his favorite themes: Pataki's close ties to D'Amato, who is
much less popular than his former protege; and the claim that
Pataki is untrustworthy. But Vallone, with far less money than
Pataki has, cannot hope to go toe-to-toe for very long in this kind
of negative, high-decibel campaigning.

THE AD CAMPAIGN: NOT SO TAXING AFTER ALL

   This is a 30-second advertisement that Gov. George Pataki's
campaign began broadcasting Friday.
</P>
<P>
   PRODUCER: Chris Mottola
</P>
<P>
   ON THE SCREEN: The ad opens with a picture of the Democratic
nominee, Peter Vallone, against a background of dollar bills, his
name displayed in white letters. When the narrator accuses Vallone
of voting for higher taxes 78 times, the ring of a cash register is
heard, and a tab with the legend ``Voted 78 Times for Higher
Taxes'' pops up. This pattern _ cash register ringing, tab popping
up _ continues four more times, as the narrator says that Vallone
voted for higher property, commuter and sales taxes. At the end,
Vallone's name and image remain, but the tabs are replaced by the
words ``Very Taxing.''
</P>
<P>
   THE SCRIPT: ``Peter Vallone is very liberal with taxpayers'
money. He voted 78 times for higher taxes. He voted 20 times for
higher income taxes. Vallone voted 18 times to raise property
taxes. Peter Vallone voted 14 times to extend the suburban commuter
tax, and Peter Vallone even voted 20 times for higher sales taxes.
Peter Vallone, very taxing.''
</P>
<P>
   ACCURACY: Most of the 78 votes cited, some dating to the 1970s,
were not tax increases, but extensions of existing taxes. The
largest of those, a personal income tax surcharge to pay for more
police officers, was enacted in 1991 and extended last year, each
time with Pataki's support, and it was eliminated this year by
Vallone. Some of the taxes cited have since been eliminated. The
reference to property taxes is also misleading, referring, in many
instances, to the city's annual adjustment of tax rates. In this
decade, those adjustments have kept the overall tax burden roughly
unchanged, though it has raised the tax assessment on properties
whose values have risen sharply. In the eight years since the City
Council gained some power over the city budget, the city's tax
collections have risen more slowly than inflation, and more slowly
than the state's.
</P>
<P>
   SCORECARD: Pataki is relying on the most tried-and-true
Republican formula, calling Democrats ``liberal'' taxers and
spenders, which surely has worked in the past. And while the ad
does not mention New York City directly, it plays into the belief
of many upstate and suburban voters that politicians from the city,
like Vallone, want nothing more than to bleed them dry through
taxes. But it is unusual for an incumbent with an enormous lead in
the polls to go on the attack first, and so early in the general
election campaign. And while Pataki may simply be trying not to
take anything for granted, negative advertising always runs the
risk, however slight, of backfiring on the attacker.

IMPORTANCE OF NFL BACKUP QUARTERBACKS BECOMES PAINFULLY CLEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For one of the few times in Babe Laufenberg's career as an NFL
quarterback, the situation allowed for no clowning.
</P>
<P>
   The circumstance: Week 16 of the 1990 season, budding superstar
Troy Aikman unavailable because of injury and the 7-8 Cowboys
readying for a visit to Atlanta with a playoff berth on the line.
If No. 2 quarterback Laufenberg and his mates are successful, the
Cowboys leap from the depths of the previous season's 1-15 record
to a .500 mark good enough to make the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   History recalls that Laufenberg's performance was not
Aikmanesque in a 26-7 loss. The defeat essentially marked the end
of Laufenberg's football career. And it also marked the end of an
organizational philosophy that allowed the club to, in then-coach
Jimmy Johnson's vernacular, ``hang out'' at a certain position.
</P>
<P>
   After going with the rookie tandem of Aikman-Steve Walsh in
1989, and then the unproven tandem of Aikman-Laufenberg in '90,
Cowboys rosters have always included a succession of NFL-tested No.
2's.
</P>
<P>
   Until now.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Beuerlein had been a starter and winner with the Raiders.
Rodney Peete had been a starter and winner with the Lions. Bernie
Kosar had been an AFC Championship Game standout with the Browns.
Wade Wilson had gone to an NFC Championship Game with the Vikings.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Garrett, tonight's Cowboys starter in their meeting with
the New York Giants, lacks those sort of credentials. Nevertheless,
he and the rest of the backup QBs called into action in the NFL's
opening weeks of attrition is a veteran in understanding the
intricacies of When 1 Becomes 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a professional, you always focus, always study, always
prepare, no matter what your role is,'' Laufenberg says. ``But when
you're a backup who gets elevated, no matter how many times you
tell yourself to take the same steps as always in preparation, you
know you're kidding yourself.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't act the same way. You're not as relaxed. It's
completely different.''
</P>
<P>
   In the first three weeks of the season, nearly a dozen starters
went down in a flurry of aches, pains and serious injuries.
Stepping into the limelight are the likes of used-to-be's such as
Tennessee's Dave Krieg and Kansas City's Rich Gannon and
never-were's such as Tampa Bay's Steve Walsh and Buffalo's Doug
Flutie and who-knows-what-they-are's such as New Orleans' Danny
Wuerffel and Baltimore's Eric Zeier.
</P>
<P>
   ``I prepare as if I'm going to start, regardless of the
circumstances,'' Zeier said. ``That's how I train my mind.''
</P>
<P>
   That works, in principle. But in reality, say more experienced
hands, the comparison is akin to taking a Driver's Ed class as
opposed to speeding down the Autobahn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a backup quarterback on this team means you get few if
any reps,'' said Krieg, a longtime starter in Seattle and Detroit
who now backs up Steve McNair with the Oilers. ``Oh, you do a lot
of mental preparation, studying, film analysis. But that's it. And
if and when you get out there, it's your first time with the first
group.''
</P>
<P>
   How valuable is a No. 2?
</P>
<P>
   Baltimore traded for 34-year-old Jim Harbaugh to be the No. 1,
but then signed their demoted starter, 26-year-old Zeier, to a
two-year, $2.6 million contract.
</P>
<P>
   Minnesota insisted the once-retired Randall Cunningham return
for another season because in the estimation of coach Denny Green,
he was the only backup QB in the country capable of picking up the
slack for starter Brad Johnson, who now misses a month with a
broken ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle spends the money to employ three respected QBs, Warren
Moon, John Friesz and Jon Kitna.
</P>
<P>
   Backups must understand that ``guys in this league go down left
and right,'' Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson says. ``If you don't
have a second quarterback who can come in and win _ not just come
in, but win _ you're going to be in big trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   And when the backup QB situation is mishandled, the entire team
can come apart. In Detroit, there's controversy as Scott Mitchell
has moved from No. 1 to No. 3, with veteran Frank Reich getting
passed over in favor of rookie third-stringer Charlie Batch. In
Washington, Gus Frerotte was benched after Week 1, and when coach
Norv Turner chose Trent Green as his replacement, it upset both
Frerotte and erstwhile No. 2 man Jeff Hostetler.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the things that's tough is to be demoted without
stepping onto the field,'' says Hostetler, who was persuaded to
swallow his pride and return.
</P>
<P>
   Hostetler thought it was over. And an added danger in being a
No. 2 who is called upon to be a No. 1 is that the beginning might
also be the end.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hang around for a few years, like Jason has, a nice guy, a
smart guy, and everybody likes you for your personality and
smarts,'' Laufenberg says. ``Then you play. And you expose what
weaknesses you might have. And then you're out of a job. For a guy
in Jason's situation, every week might now be his last.''

BURTON HOBBLED WITH HUSKERS AHEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BUD WITHERS  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Among Washington's practice priorities this week will
be getting back a key member of the defense that performed
admirably against Brigham Young.
</P>
<P>
   Nigel Burton, the senior co-captain at rover, was hobbling in a
protective boot Sunday at the Huskies' light workout, their first
practice in preparation for Nebraska Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one that has not swollen,'' UW coach Jim Lambright said
hopefully. ``I expect him back. It's just real important to get as
much work on the (Nebraska) option as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton's availability is important for the Huskies. At 5-foot-9
and 180 pounds, he is undersized, but this is his third season of
starting, and his backups are unproven.
</P>
<P>
   The Huskies list true freshman Andrae Perry as Burton's backup,
but senior walk-on Hakim Weatherspoon took over in Burton's absence
against BYU. Also in the competition is redshirt freshman Anthony
Vontoure, but cornerback Renard Edwards _ recently moved from a
backup rover position _ would give the Huskies more size at the
position.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, slotback Dane Looker, whose absence with a thigh
injury hurt a sputtering Husky offense, showed much more mobility
and is expected to start against the Huskers.
</P>
<P>
   The Nebraska-Washington game is the fourth such matchup in the
'90s, and the first in which Nebraska is the higher-ranked team.
Both polls have the 3-0 Huskers No. 2 this week, while Washington
is ranked eighth in the USA Today/ESPN poll and ninth by The
Associated Press.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the game's implication for the rankings, Lambright
laughed and said, ``For us, it's Game 3. That's as far as we're
taking this thing right now. I'm still trying to figure out how
many freshmen we're going to take on this trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The game will be a measure of how each program has rebounded
from heavy losses to the NFL draft. The Huskies had 10 players
taken, more than any school, but Nebraska had more high-end talent
with defensive linemen Grant Wistrom and Jason Peter going among
the top 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'd trade our depth for theirs right now,'' Lambright
said.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Nebraska was a difficult read a year ago in this spot _
having come off victories against Akron and Central Florida _ so
are the Huskers again something of an unknown quantity with three
victories against outclassed opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little bit harder because of the coaching change, and
the injuries they've had,'' Lambright said, referring to the
resignation of Tom Osborne and appointment of longtime aide Frank
Solich.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you lose a quarterback, you change a little bit, and
changing quarterbacks is something they haven't had to deal with
the past couple of years.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Frost graduated, leaving the job to sophomore Bobby
Newcombe. He sustained a knee injury in the Nebraska opener against
Louisiana Tech, but is listed as the starter again. I-back DeAngelo
Evans, whose first snap since 1996 has been long-awaited by Big Red
faithful, is expected back from a knee injury but is not listed on
the preliminary two-deep.
</P>
<P>
   Reacting to BYU player comments that they could read Husky
quarterback Brock Huard's audibles at the line of scrimmage,
Lambright said, ``I don't think anybody could pick up in one game
our signals for this year.'' But he said he and his staff would
examine the issue.

SEAHAWKS RUN PAST WASHINGTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Nine minutes into Sunday's game against the Washington
Redskins, the Seahawks found themselves in unfamiliar and unwanted
territory.
</P>
<P>
   These new Seahawks, the ones who had toyed with and trampled the
Philadelphia Eagles and Arizona Cardinals in their first two games,
were looking too much like the old Seahawks, the ones who had
gotten so used to not having prosperity that too often they played
like they couldn't handle it.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskins had just scored to make it 7-7. The Seahawks
offense had just gone three-and-out on consecutive possessions. The
league's top-ranked defense was having a difficult time stopping
Redskins running back Terry Allen, wide receiver Michael Westbrook
and quarterback Trent Green, who was making only his second NFL
start.
</P>
<P>
   The voice in Bob Bratkowski's ear was not happy. It was head
coach Dennis Erickson and he was telling his offensive coordinator
he wanted the Seahawks to start putting the ball in the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dennis felt we needed to throw it to get something going,''
said Bratkowski, who watches the game from the coaches box on the
200 level of the Kingdome and communicates through headsets with
Erickson along the sideline.
</P>
<P>
   Bratkowski prevailed, and so did the Seahawks, running their
record to 3-0 for only the second time in club history with a 24-14
victory before an announced crowd of 63,336.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those guys upstairs didn't panic,'' Erickson said. ``I wanted
to throw it every down, but they wanted to stay with the run. So I
let them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks' ability to run the ball, and insistence on doing
it, was the thread that held together this game that looked like it
was about to unravel on several occasions.
</P>
<P>
   The special teams gave the Seahawks a giant shove in the right
direction when Steve Broussard returned the opening kickoff 90
yards for a touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   The defense gave up too many yards (465) and too many
completions (27 for 383 yards and two TDs), but held the Redskins
in check by intercepting a Green pass at the Seattle 15-yard line,
forcing and recovering an Allen fumble at the Seattle 11 and
stopping Washington twice on downs in the fourth quarter _ once at
the Seattle 34-yard line and again at the Seattle 5.
</P>
<P>
   Kicker David Akers, who was signed Tuesday after Scott Blanton
missed a pair of field goals in the Redskins' loss to the San
Francisco 49ers on Monday night, missed two of his own in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to credit the defense for these wins the last two
weeks,'' said Ricky Watters, who had his second straight 100-yard
rushing game and finished with 181 yards on 30 touches (24 carries
for 136 and six receptions for 45).
</P>
<P>
   While the Seahawks' defense was stretching that old
bend-but-don't-break adage precariously thin, the Seahawks'
offensive line was grinding away at the Redskins. After rushing for
only 53 yards in the first half, the Seahawks made an adjustment
that paid off in 110 rushing yards and two TDs on the team's first
two possessions of the second half.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks spent much of the first half trying to run from
their three-receiver package. They went with an extra receiver
because in the Redskins' season-opening losses to the New York
Giants and 49ers, they had matched up with this alignment by
replacing their defensive ends with two linebackers, giving them a
front six that consisted of three linebackers, two defensive
tackles and a defensive back.
</P>
<P>
   Not Sunday. The Redskins played the Seahawks with their base
defense.
</P>
<P>
   A coaching staff that had been suspect in the past for its
inability to make changes on the run, did just that. The Seahawks
came out in the second half with two backs and two receivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever,'' Bratkowski said. ``I guess you can make that
judgment. I think we've done a pretty good job offensively over the
last few years. We just haven't won games. Now, we're winning
games.''
</P>
<P>
   After linebacker Darrin Smith intercepted a Green pass at the
Redskins' 19-yard line, Watters scored on a 13-yard run two plays
later by sweeping to his right and cutting behind a block from
tackle Howard Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a play you only run once or twice a week, then let it
die for a couple of weeks,'' Bratkowski said. ``It has kind of an
element of surprise.''
</P>
<P>
   The next time the Seahawks got the ball, they went to work
again. Watters ran for 2 yards, caught a pass for 5 and then darted
and spun for 33 yards on third-and-3. Rookie Ahman Green came on to
spell Watters, but the Redskins couldn't break the spell. Green ran
for 5 and then 7 yards. On first down from the 21, quarterback
Warren Moon used a play-action fake to Watters and rollout that
allowed wide receiver Mike Pritchard to run uncovered into the end
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard's TD catch made it 24-7, and the Seahawks were well on
their way to being 3-0 for the first time since 1986.
</P>
<P>
   The Seahawks are unbeaten, but the victories have come against
three NFC East teams that have one win among them. Now come the 2-1
Steelers in Pittsburgh this week, then the Chiefs in Kansas City
and an Oct. 11 game against the defending Super Bowl champion
Denver Broncos at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   As good as the Seahawks have been, they'll have to be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it gets good. It gets darn good,'' defensive end Michael
Sinclair said. ``We're going to have to get our game going. I'm not
saying it can't be done, but we're going to have to go in there on
our game.''

BEST IN THE BIZ? SEGUI TABS RODRIGUEZ 
</HEADLINE>

   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Champagne in a baseball clubhouse in late
September is meant to be sprayed. This bottle, with a piece of
athletic tape carrying the message ``Congrats on 40/40'' attached,
was meant to be savored.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners first baseman David Segui delivered it to shortstop
Alex Rodriguez after Saturday's game, in which Rodriguez homered to
become the third player in major league history with 40 home runs
and 40 stolen bases in the same season. In a year that will not end
in showers of bubbly for the sub-.500 Mariners, the moment was
worthy of a toast.
</P>
<P>
   ``It pretty much reinforces to me that he's the best ballplayer
in the game,'' said Segui. ``Definitely, (Barry) Bonds and (Ken
Griffey) Junior are up there with him, but the way he plays the
game sets him apart from everyone else, I think. He plays the game
with the intensity of a fringe player, which is a compliment. He
plays the game the way it's supposed to be played, plays to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not alone in this: He's the best in the game. The way he
goes about it day in and day out, with a desire to get better _
it's very impressive. ... Let me put it this way: Most superstars
wouldn't do the things that he does.''
</P>
<P>
   No player has reached 40/40 faster than the 23-year-old
Rodriguez, who is younger by a year than Jose Canseco in 1988, and
nine years younger than Bonds in 1996. Both of those players hit 42
homers and stole 40 bases; with 40 homers and 43 steals,
Rodriguez's totals already represent the most productive 40/40
season in history.
</P>
<P>
   Mariners broadcaster Dave Henderson was a teammate of Canseco's
on the '88 Oakland Athletics, and said he counts Willie Mays and
Bobby Bonds as the only other players in history capable of doing
what Rodriguez, Canseco and Bonds have done.
</P>
<P>
   ``People used to talk about `five-tool' players,'' Henderson
said. ``This puts it way beyond the `five-tool' player.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . Once the league adjusted to him, he made his own
adjustments. That signifies greatness. There's no fluke in the
man's game.''
</P>
<P>
   The only fluke may have been a 10-game homerless stretch between
No. 39, on Sept. 7, and Saturday's No. 40. Rodriguez admits he was
pressing until finally connecting off Angels right-hander Jack
McDowell, and said his mother had been going to church for a week
praying for the 40th homer to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez dutifully thanked ``the man upstairs,'' and his
God-given talents certainly had something to do with his
accomplishment. But so did that desire to improve.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a great lesson for me as a young player about the
necessity of hard work,'' said Rodriguez, who hired a personal
trainer and worked out 5-6 times a week last off-season. ``That's
what I attribute this to, all my work. It's probably the thing I'm
most proud of, more than being the batting champion (in 1996). This
is something I'm very, very proud of and something I'll never
forget.''
</P>
<P>
   Canseco and Bonds both clinched their 40/40 seasons with a
stolen base. For Rodriguez, the stolen bases came first, and, he
said, he's more proud of the steals than the homers.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez displayed his power with 36 homers in 1996, but he
didn't think he'd steal many more than 25 bases in a season. He
averaged fewer than 15 steals in his first three professional
seasons, and stole 29 bases in '97.
</P>
<P>
   Teammate Rich Amaral, who stole 50 bases three times in the
minors, encouraged Rodriguez last year to set his sights on 50.
That motivated Rodriguez to concentrate more on base stealing and
gear his workouts toward handling the inherent physical rigors.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's very fast, quick and he's just a great athlete,'' said
Amaral. ``He's got great instincts. I think the one thing he
probably didn't realize is how many opportunities you'll come
across over the course of a year, if you're looking for them and
playing every day like he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez frequently seeks Amaral's advice _ he called him from
the road the other day when Amaral, who is on the disabled list,
was away from the team _ and Amaral is happy to give it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love talking to him about base stealing,'' said Amaral. ``I
love researching the pitchers, and he and I will go over their
quickness to the plate, what they throw, tendencies. It's been
exciting for me to have him so excited about that aspect of the
game.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez has also shared that excitement with the all-time
stolen base leader. When Oakland came to Seattle in June, Rodriguez
sought out Rickey Henderson. Henderson, who had power to go with
his speed in his heyday,said inquisitiveness is Rodriguez's best
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's an outstanding ballplayer, but he's a tremendous
learner,'' Henderson said. ``We spent time talking about base
stealing, and he put it together and learned something. He wants to
learn and be the best he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   By one measure, no player ever has been better.

WATTERS CARRYING SEAHAWKS' TO HIGHER LEVEL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The mark of true studmuffin-hood in the NFL is when
you're so good, the best play of your afternoon is the play that
needs only your smile.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the third quarter Sunday with the Seahawks up 17-7 over
the Washington Redskins in a game far closer, the Seattle offense
was lurching and flopping like a 300-pound halibut in a skiff.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the Seahawk coaches said they were going to stick with
one thing until the Redskins did something about it. They went all
Ricky, all the time, kind of like a 24-hour specialty cable
channel.
</P>
<P>
   Watters dive for 2 yards. Watters screen pass for 5. Watters off
tackle for 33 yards.
</P>
<P>
   A momentary switch of backs, but rookie Ahman Green did a nasty
Watters impression. Up the middle for 5. Around left end for 7.
</P>
<P>
   Then Watters returned to the game with the Seahawks on the
Washington 21 with a first down. The entire defense of the nation's
capital, along with the National Guard, President Clinton's lawyers
and Buddy the dog, were poised on tippy-toes ready to pounce on
Watters.
</P>
<P>
   As the lone back, he almost leaped for the handoff from
quarterback Warren Moon, who instead tucked the ball on his hip and
rolled into what the laceheads call a naked bootleg pass. A
grinning Watters, meanwhile, carried the fake to an Oscar
nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Seahawk receiver Mike Pritchard could not have been more open if
he had said bad things about Mark McGwire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our safety (Leomont Evans) got caught up in the run,'' said
Redskins coach Norv Turner. ``There's no question he was way, way,
way aggressive, and he just bit. It's not a play they should get
that open on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pritchard was more in danger of being hit by an asteroid than a
Redskin defender. His touchdown catch was not only the
spirit-breaker in the Seahawks' 24-14 win, it made an eloquent
statement that this is Watters' offense.
</P>
<P>
   And that offense is better than when it was Moon's offense.
</P>
<P>
   When Watters rushes for 136 hard yards (as well a catching six
passes for 45 yards) against a gravelly defensive front and his
most effective play is a play-action fake, the Seahawks are on to
something.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the Seahawks had prettier statistics when Moon came
out having to throw. But defenses eventually caught up and forced
him into mistakes. With Watters the marquee event in the Seahawk
theater, defenses can't cheat nearly as much.
</P>
<P>
   The upshot is that Moon has thrown 77 passes this season without
an interception. While that makes a small point about the
uselessness of training camp for some players _ camp was the last
thing Moon missed _ the larger point is that the Seahawks are
throwing when they want, not when they must.
</P>
<P>
   This season, the Seahawks haven't even been behind.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, their 3-0 start entirely has been against the NFC East,
which has collected more treadmarks than the driveway into
Disneyland. But Sunday the Redskins actually introduced an element
of dignity into the season by offering up resistance.
</P>
<P>
   As with Philadelphia and Arizona, Washington also had a
quarterback as green as his name. Trent Green might be the greatest
new quarterback in the NFL _ if the game were played only between
the 30-yard lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Redskin defenders were a different story, doing the
three-and-out trick against the Seahawks enough times that coach
Dennis Erickson was desperate to go to his instinctive bombs-away
routine.
</P>
<P>
   But offensive playcaller Bob Bratkowski's faith in the running
game prevailed, and the Seahawks ground out a win more notable for
its reduced-mistake efficiency than its spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way we want to do it from the beginning,'' said
Moon, apparently unmoved by his lesser role. ``By the second half,
we should have teams worn down enough for our offensive line to
take over. That's how it happened today. You've seen in the first
games a lot of short carries in the first half, and all of a sudden
those carries get to be long runs in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ricky is a workhorse back who gets better as the game goes
along. He's not going to shy away from contact. When the offensive
line sees a back doing that, they're going to give a little
extra.''
</P>
<P>
   Giving was especially pronounced in the second half, when the
Seahawks responded to their first real pressure situation of the
season by giving the ball to Watters, the high-priced, supposedly
high-maintenance free agent, 14 times for 85 yards. Included was
his 33-yarder that had two broken tackles, a spin move worthy of
Michael Jordan and a relentlessness that is his trademark.
</P>
<P>
   ``The last thing my dad told me last night when I talked to
him,'' Watters said, ``was `You hit that hole fast, and when you
get in that secondary you spin on them.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember a while back, I was trying to be more powerful. He
said, `I like the way you're hitting the holes, but put that spin
move back in there.' He loves the spin move.''
</P>
<P>
   A lot of Kingdome fans were howling along with the old man, too.
Even when Watters does nothing more than smile empty-handed, it
puts a fresh spin on the Seahawk offense.

MARINERS WASTE CHANCES, FALL TO ANGELS

<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's been six years since Paul Abbott had the
kind of feeling he experienced last night: a sold-out crowd roaring
with their team's pennant hopes on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Abbott played for the pennant-contending Minnesota Twins in
1992, and remembers the eardrum-busting shouts of a packed
Metrodome. A crowd of 42,972 squeezed into Edison International
Field to watch the Anaheim Angels and Mariners Sunday night, and a
win by the home team would even up the American League West
Division race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The crowd was really going crazy and getting really loud in
the third inning,'' said Abbott, who worked six innings for the
Mariners. ``I was thinking, this is great. This is really fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun, that is, until the Angels pushed across three runs in the
inning and hung on to win, 3-1. Anaheim now stands tied with the
Texas Rangers for first place, while the Mariners completed their
final road trip with a 6-4 record.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had their chances, leaving runners in scoring
position in five of the first seven innings. Each of those runners
got into scoring position with less than two outs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had many chances tonight,'' said manager Lou Piniella.
``Many, many, many chances that we didn't take advantage of.
Outside of that, it was a good ballgame. Abbott pitched well, and
so did their people.''
</P>
<P>
   Abbott (2-1), making his third start after missing most of the
season recovering from a serious elbow injury, gave up four singles
and threw two wild pitches in the Angels' three-run third. He
allowed one hit and no runs in his other five innings.
</P>
<P>
   ``The wild pitches killed me,'' Abbott said. ``We brought the
infield in and I got ground balls; they just got through.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Mariner Omar Olivares threw six shutout innings before
leaving with two on and no outs in the seventh. A sacrifice fly by
Ken Griffey Jr. off reliever Jarrod Washburn brought home one run,
but Washburn, Pep Harris and Troy Percival took care of things from
there.
</P>
<P>
   It was Olivares' second win of the year against the Mariners,
and the right-hander stands 6-2 against Seattle lifetime. He's been
particularly effective against Griffey, holding him to three hits
in 26 career at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Griffey tried something different when he faced the
sinker-balling Olivares in the first inning. David Bell and Alex
Rodriguez led off with singles, and Griffey bunted, popping to
catcher Matt Walbeck on the second attempt. After an Edgar Martinez
single loaded the bases, Olivares escaped with a strikeout and a
fly out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it in the rule book that I'm not allowed to bunt?'' Griffey
said. ``I'm not allowed to do the little things to help my team
win? I'm not allowed to do that?''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels were pleased Griffey took advantage of his right.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I really think he's trying to get 100 RBIs for Edgar
Martinez,'' said Angels coach Larry Bowa. ``He told Walbeck to tell
me on Friday that he was going to lay one down, and I told him to
go right ahead. Tonight, I was saying to him after he bunted,
`Thank you very much.' ''

ANGELS SET THE STAGE WITH VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Manager Terry Collins got angry last week when he
thought his Angels overlooked the Tampa Bay Devil Rays before
heading into their series with the Texas Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Against the Seattle Mariners, Collins had no such concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels played the Mariners as though Texas didn't exist,
winning 3-1 on Sunday night before a sellout crowd of 42,972 at
Edison Field to take two of three in the series.
</P>
<P>
   With the win, the Angels tied the Rangers at 83-72 for first
place in the AL West. The two teams begin a three-game series
tonight at Edison Field.
</P>
<P>
   But before the Angels could turn their attention to Texas, there
stood Ken Griffey Jr. and the rest of the Mariners.
</P>
<P>
   It was only three years ago that the Mariners rallied from a
13-game deficit in early August to claim the division title. The
Mariners also held off the Angels last season in the final month of
the season to win the division.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very important series for us,'' Angels shortstop Gary
DiSarcina said. ``Seattle's always been our nemesis. They've always
blocked us from getting to the next level. They were playing to
win. They have a lot of pride. They don't want to see anybody
celebrating on their time.''
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, it took a solid outing from a
starting pitcher, good defense, timely hitting and some clutch
relief pitching to pull it off.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares (9-8) went six-plus innings and gave up only one
run and eight hits to get the victory. The Angels scored all three
of their runs in the third inning off losing pitcher Paul Abbott
(1-2). Randy Velarde had a sacrifice fly, followed by RBI singles
from Jim Edmonds and Tim Salmon.
</P>
<P>
   For the second night in a row, Edmonds made a diving catch in
center field.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrod Washburn replaced Olivares with runners on second and
third and nobody out in the seventh and escaped, allowing only a
sacrifice fly to Griffey. He also struck out Edgar Martinez _ just
as Mike Holtz did one night earlier _ by throwing a changeup by him
for a called third strike.
</P>
<P>
   Pep Harris and Troy Percival (42nd save) pitched the eighth and
ninth innings, respectively, to close it out.
</P>
<P>
   It was only two days ago that the Angels had lost four in a row
and had fallen two games behind the Rangers. But the Angels
responded when they absolutely had to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I sound like a broken record,'' Salmon said. ``But how
many times have we been written off? How many times have we been
devastated by injuries? We've always come back. That's the way this
team is.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We just keep stretching for more,'' Velarde said. ``We fight.
We have a will to win. It all comes down to who wants it the
most.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares set the tone Sunday, making his second consecutive
solid start since replacing the erratic Jeff Juden in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   In the first inning, the Mariners loaded the bases with one out,
but Olivares struck out Raul Ibanez and got Russ Davis to fly out.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the Mariners had at least one runner in scoring
position in all but two innings against Olivares, who found a way
out of trouble until the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   ``His ability to get ground balls gets him out of innings,''
Collins said. ``You've got to be careful about jumping the gun (and
taking Olivares out). He made some pitches when he had to.''
</P>
<P>
   Olivares also got some help from Griffey, who tried to bunt with
runners on first and second and none out in the first, and popped
out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen him do that,'' Olivares said. ``I don't know
why (he did), but I'm happy he did.''

<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Cal Ripken, who had not missed a game since 1982,
removed himself from the Baltimore Orioles' starting lineup here
Sunday night after playing in 2,632 consecutive games.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken walked into the office of Orioles manager Ray Miller
about half an hour before Sunday night's game and said, ``I think
the time is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's staggering feat of endurance, credited with helping
baseball regain the loyalty of its fans three summers ago when he
broke Lou Gehrig's longstanding record of 2,130 consecutive games,
officially ended when Rafael Palmeiro grounded out to complete the
Orioles' 5-4 loss to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   After the final out, Ripken, 38, shook hands with his teammates
as photographers descended upon the Orioles' dugout. He then walked
onto the field and into the nearby box seats to hug his wife,
Kelly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel a sense of relief,'' he said at a post-game news
conference. ``I don't feel much different. Now that I know what it
feels like, I don't want to sit and watch a game anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said that he and his wife had talked last Thursday about
ending the streak and that the time was right Sunday, in the
Orioles' last home game of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was very important for us to do it here,'' he said. ``Right
here in Baltimore, right here in Camden Yards. And make it a
celebration.''
</P>
<P>
   The late change in the Orioles' lineup was not reflected until
just minutes before the start of the game. When the name of Ryan
Minor was inserted in Ripken's place at third base on the
scoreboard, only a few fans at Camden Yards reacted, pointing at
the change.
</P>
<P>
   Just before the Baltimore starters ran onto the field to begin
the game with the Yankees, Ripken wrestled playfully with a
teammate in the Orioles' dugout. When Minor jogged to third base
for his third major league game, fans still did not seem sure of
what was taking place. But after New York's Chuck Knoblauch, the
game's first batter, grounded out to shortstop, the entire Yankees
team emerged from the visiting dugout and tipped their caps across
the field, to Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles fans, who stood and cheered Ripken for more than 22
minutes when he broke Gehrig's record on Sept. 6, 1995, stood at
8:11 p.m. to salute him once again.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken burst from the Orioles' dugout, playfully waving for the
fans to sit, but they would not stop cheering and the Yankees would
not stop clapping. Ripken returned to the Orioles' dugout and the
standing ovation continued. Derek Jeter, on deck, stood out of the
batter's box, and the Orioles' pitcher, Doug Johns, waited, having
no intention of interfering with the moment.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken emerged once again, raising both hands, intermittently
turning to face all corners of Camden Yards and acknowledging the
three minutes of cheers before motioning to Johns to throw his next
pitch. Johns obliged him, and for the first time since May 29,
1982, an Orioles' game was being played without Ripken.
</P>
<P>
   At the time Ripken tied and broke Gehrig's record, baseball was
coming back from labor strife that had led to the cancellation of
the 1994 World Series. The national respect and adulation for
Ripken at that time was seen as extremely important to the recovery
of baseball; the celebration of the game on the nights of Sept. 5
and Sept. 6 was comparable to how the country has reacted this
summer to Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa as they broke Roger Maris'
single-season record for home runs.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's production has gradually diminished as he has aged,
though the Orioles' coaching staff values him because of his
intensity and his reliability. Ripken, the Orioles' shortstop since
the first year of the streak, was moved to third base permanently
after the 1996 season, and in 1997, Ripken suffered a lower back
problem so painful that he said he nearly walked off the field.
</P>
<P>
   There had been growing sentiment within the Baltimore
organization since 1995 that Ripken's streak should be ended, that
he would benefit from additional rest and that other players would
be helped by getting additional playing time in his place. Ripken
had said all along that the decision to end his consecutive-game
streak lay solely in the hands of his manager, but each manager
disagreed, understanding the magnitude of Ripken's accomplishment
and its significance in the history of the sport. Davey Johnson,
Ripken's manager in 1995 and 1996, once said that only God or
Ripken himself could end the streak.

</P>
<P>
   Orioles officials had discussed the possibility of ending
Ripken's streak this summer. One executive had said in May that the
streak could end by July, and for several years club executives
have felt that Ripken's autonomy _ a status created by the streak _
was damaging to the spirit of the team.
</P>
<P>
   Willie Otanez, a third baseman who hit 30 home runs for Class
AAA Rochester this season, was called up last month, and because of
Ripken's streak, Otanez played out of position, in right field, and
broke his wrist awkwardly attempting a diving catch. Ripken
continued to play, with his run production the worst among American
League third basemen, and criticism of the streak had grown.
</P>
<P>
   According to John Maroon, the club's spokesman, Ripken and
Miller had privately discussed the possibility of ending the streak
for several weeks. Ripken felt the timing was right: The Orioles
played their final home game here Sunday night; the club is on the
verge of elimination from the playoff race, and the team has
several young infielders available who are seen as part of the
team's future, including Minor, who will go down in history as the
man who replaced a legend.
</P>
<P>
   About 20 minutes before Sunday night's game, Maroon received an
urgent call from Miller, and Maroon hustled to the manager's
office, where Ripken sat in full uniform. ``Hey, man, I'm not
starting,'' Ripken said to Maroon, his tone even.
</P>
<P>
   Gehrig ended his streak in 1939, going to Yankees manager Joe
McCarthy frustrated and confused by his lack of production. Gehrig
did not know at the time that he was dying of a disease that now
takes his name.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken was born and raised in Maryland, the son of an Orioles
minor league manager, seemingly fated to play for Baltimore.
Drafted by the Orioles in 1978, Ripken was 6 feet 4 inches and 220
pounds, by conventional standards too big to play shortstop. But
Earl Weaver, then the Orioles' manager, shifted Ripken from third
base to shortstop in 1982 because of his exceptional hands, his
ability to anticipate and his instinctive understanding of the
game. Ripken won the American League most valuable player award in
1983 and again in 1991, and he holds numerous offensive and
defensive records for shortstops.
</P>
<P>
   Albert Belle of the Chicago White Sox now has the longest streak
among active players at 325 games. He would have to play into the
year 2012, when he would be 45 years old, to approach Ripken's
record.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees won their 107th game, three short of the team record
for a season and four shy of the American League record with eight
games left to play. Orlando Hernandez improved to 11-4, allowing
one run and five hits in six innings, and Mariano Rivera earned his
36th save. Derek Jeter hit a two-run triple in the eighth inning,
his eighth triple of the season, to give the Yankees a 4-1 lead,
and Shane Spencer added a run-scoring double in the eighth.

RED SOX SWEPT AWAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ So now, in every sense of the phrase, it comes down to
the home stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Eight games left to be played, all at Fenway Park, the wild card
on the table.
</P>
<P>
   With a four-game lead on the field, it's not going to take
Secretariat to win this race. The Red Sox are proving that a
three-legged pony will do, as long as its heart doesn't come to a
complete stop within sight of the finish line.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to preach to this team this week that it's all in
front of you,'' said Mo Vaughn, making plans to try and inspire a
bunch that probably could use a revival meeting after being swept
three straight in Chicago by the White Sox, who won Sunday's series
finale, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking forward to going home, man,'' said Vaughn, who had
three hits, including his 37th home run, and drove in three runs
but couldn't keep the Sox from being swept here for the first time
in eight years. ``That's just what it's all about. We'll be ready,
primed and ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hell, let it fly, let it fly. I know I'll let it fly.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who have won just six of 19 games this month (3-4
on this trip) and Sunday saw their magic number stall at 4, were
grounded Sunday by a confluence of calamities, most of their own
making. Three times they held a lead _ 1-0 on Vaughn's home run in
the first, 3-1 on Vaughn's two-run single in the third, 4-3 on
Darren Lewis's double and John Valentin's single in the fifth. Each
time they gave it back, or once for every error they made Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six runs scored by the White Sox were unearned, a
trend that prevailed on a weekend in which the home team profited
by nine runs tainted by Red Sox errors.
</P>
<P>
   Their last act of generosity came in the seventh. Jim Corsi, the
third Sox pitcher, was an out away from preserving a 4-3 lead when
third baseman Valentin, who has been the most sure-handed of Sox
infielders, made his first error in 65 games, failing to come up
with Mike Caruso's smash right at him.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin was playing on the grass in the event of a bunt by
Caruso, who had bunted a previous pitch foul down the first-base
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``He hit the ball pretty sharply,'' Valentin said. ``I tried to
block it and keep it in front of me. It kind of skipped on me and
didn't really come up. It hit my glove and trickled past me. It was
a tough play, but I'd like to think that nine times out of 10, I
keep that ball in front of me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we made three errors, and usually when you make three
errors you're not going to win a ballgame. On key plays, we played
a little erratic. That's why we lost.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Cameron, who was on third after what Corsi described as a
``soft-serve'' double and an infield out, scored on Valentin's
error, tying the score at 4. Jimy Williams then called for Dennis
Eckersley, who hadn't given up a run since Aug. 12, but this
clearly wasn't a day for holding form.
</P>
<P>
   Eckersley gave up back-to-back doubles to Frank Thomas and
Albert Belle, still the most ferocious pair of righthanded hitters
found in any lineup, even if Belle on his best behavior is regarded
as the anti-Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's get out of town,'' said Eckersley. ``Momentum, it's
over. Wake up tomorrow, you're home, it's totally different. You
leave, you go somewhere else, it's like a new beginning.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gotten these guys out a lot over the years, but they got
me today. It catches up with you.''
</P>
<P>
   Chicago scored twice in the third inning without a hit. Ray
Durham walked and wound up at third when he stole second and
received a bonus base when Tim Wakefield's pitch tricked Jason
Varitek for a passed ball. After Caruso drew a walk, Thomas hit a
fly ball to shallow right. Lewis's throw home was true and arrived
at the same time as Durham, who met a stone wall in Varitek, who
had sealed off the plate.
</P>
<P>
   Varitek, to his regret, never saw the ball, which careened past
him. ``I got hit right before the ball got there,'' Varitek said.
``I can tell you that if I had been able to hang onto the ball, he
would have never gotten to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Durham scored on what was charged as an error to Lewis, and when
Wakefield, backing up the play, bounced his throw into left field,
Caruso scored, too, but not without Varitek absorbing another
collision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two in about 10 seconds,'' said Varitek. ``Sometimes you've
got to give yourself up.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without a couple of freak things happening, we had a chance to
win that game. This has to click for us, sooner or later. We're too
good of a team for it not to.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sox are a team that begins its final week with more wins
than any team in the American League outside of the Yankees and
Indians, who already have qualified for the playoffs. A team that
could qualify for its own playoff berth as soon as Tuesday, if it
can come home and win three straight from an expansion team, the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays, while its pursuers lose at least once.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are a team that has lost six of its last eight
series and lost more games than it has won since the All-Star
break, but still is in ideal position to throw a party sometime
this week. At home, where the ghosts may have other ideas, but
where the ghosts should have no say in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on our way back to Boston,'' Williams said. ``Good
things will happen to us in Boston.''

AL WEST RACE BEGINS ANEW WITH SHOWDOWN
</HEADLINE>

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM _ Last Thursday during the seventh inning of the
Angels-Texas Rangers game in Arlington, a television camera zoomed
in on the Rangers' Mark McLemore.
</P>
<P>
   The former Angel had a scowl on his face as he paced in the
dugout and yelled out at Angels pitcher Pep Harris. In turn, Harris
yelled right back.
</P>
<P>
   The two kept it up until the home plate umpire had to go out to
the mound and calm Harris down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to rattle me,'' Harris said of McLemore. ``He
was trying to fire his guys up. So I yelled at him. I was just
trying to get my guys going too.''
</P>
<P>
   It was nothing personal, just a pennant race. And while it seems
few people outside Anaheim and Arlington are paying attention, it's
still the only race for a division title up for grabs.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Rangers begin a three-game series tonight at
Edison Field that could decide who goes to New York to face the
Yankees in the first round of the playoffs, and who goes home.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels will finish up the regular season with four games in
Oakland while the Rangers play four in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've played 155 games to come into (tonight),'' Angels
manager Terry Collins said. ``A lot of days we've sat in here and
talked about looking at the scoreboard and worrying about what the
Rangers are doing or who they're playing. Now it's in our yard,
it's in our hands. That's the way you want to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Rangers have been buried in the sports pages by
Mark McGwire's and Sammy Sosa's home run duel. Even the National
League wild-card race _ which includes the major media markets of
New York and Chicago _ gets better play on the national sports
highlights shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, I was watching TV and I didn't even know the
Braves had clinched,'' Collins said. ``The Astros _ I managed them
two years ago and I didn't know they clinched. Everything was
centered on Sosa and McGwire. And we're all happy for the two of
them. But believe me, it's not taking away from my concentration. I
hope Sosa and McGwire hit 75 home runs, but I don't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels and Rangers begin the series tied at 83-72, but the
Rangers have an advantage in knowing they swept the Angels in a
two-game series last week in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers beat the Angels' two most effective pitchers _ Chuck
Finley and Steve Sparks _ and won the second game after trailing
4-0. It's the Rangers' lineup, led by Juan Gonzalez, that puts a
scare into any pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   But tonight, the Angels have more to contend with than the
Rangers hitters. Todd Stottlemyre held the Angels to one run in
eight innings in the Rangers' 5-3 win last Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hadn't seen Stottlemyre in something like three years. Now
guys have got a good read on him,'' shortstop Gary DiSarcina said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was too excited about Stottlemyre,'' center fielder Jim
Edmonds said. ``The next day I was more relaxed and it worked a lot
better (he had three hits, including a homer). You can get too
emotional sometimes and it can work against you. You need to relax
and just play.''
</P>
<P>
   Win or lose, the Angels insist they won't choke. Comparisons to
the collapse of 1995 are not allowed in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing we're trying to do is make sure we don't get
uptight,'' Collins said. ``We want to make sure we have fun with
this. We've got a lot of young players. You want these guys to see
what it takes, put 'em in these situations as many times as you
can.''

IN PRIMARY, BEING LIBERAL MEANT LESS THAN BEING RICH 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For the last generation, the most liberal candidate
has always been a good bet to win a statewide Democratic primary in
New York.
</P>
<P>
   Ideology has often been able to trump money, with a string of
candidates on the left defeating more centrist opponents who spent
far more: Elizabeth Holtzman over Bess Myerson in the 1980 Senate
primary; Mario Cuomo over Edward Koch in the 1982 gubernatorial
primary; Mark Green over John Dyson in the 1986 Senate primary;
Karen Burstein over Oliver Koppell in the 1994 primary for attorney
general.
</P>
<P>
   But last week's primary turned that pattern on its head. In
races for senator, governor and attorney general, the winners were
the best-financed candidates in their primary races, and arguably
the most centrist.
</P>
<P>
   The results have many prominent New York Democrats wondering
whether the hidebound liberalism of their party's core voters has
softened over the years, if those voters have become more
pragmatic, or if money has simply become an irresistible force in
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the glaring conclusion is the impact that money has in
modern American politics,'' said Robert Abrams, the former attorney
general. ``It buys radio and TV spots, which provide candidates
name and issue recognition, and that's what I think is common in
all of these races.''
</P>
<P>
   He contended that the role of money is greater than ever, not
just because the sums are larger, but also because Democrats, their
party weakened in recent years, no longer have the kind of
grass-roots political machinery they once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out walking with my wife on Saturday,'' Abrams said,
``and here it was the weekend before the big primary, and there was
no street campaign. No tables with pamphlets. No rallies. I saw so
few posters in this campaign. It's not like the old days. It's all
on the airwaves.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Schumer, the winner of the Senate primary, lagged
far behind Geraldine Ferraro in opinion surveys until he used his
financial advantage to blanket the airwaves with his face and
voice.
</P>
<P>
   The New York City Council speaker, Peter Vallone, was roughly
tied in polls with Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, then pulled well
ahead when he became the first to advertise on television.
</P>
<P>
   The four candidates for attorney general were roughly even until
Eliot Spitzer, clearly the most conservative, far outspent the
others on advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most striking results last Tuesday was the showing of
Mark Green, clearly the most liberal candidate in the Senate race,
who finished third in his primary, behind Schumer and Ferraro.
Green, New York City's public advocate, had the sort of name
recognition and experience that are crucial to an underfinanced
candidate, yet he received just 19 percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mark Green is the closest thing you have to a strong liberal
movement in New York these days,'' said Cuomo, the former governor.
``You could point to what happened to him as evidence that ideology
does not mean what it used to mean.''
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that the shift might have been under way, little
noticed, for years. ``Look,'' he said, ``Bill Clinton is very
popular among New York Democrats, and he is not a liberal.''
</P>
<P>
   But he, too, pointed to the role of money. ``Spitzer,'' he said,
``wins only because of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the Democrats interviewed said it was harder to draw
conclusions from Vallone's victory. Ross, his main rival, stumbled
badly because of internal problems, and the other two, Charles
Hynes, the Brooklyn district attorney, and James Larocca, a former
state transportation commissioner, never mounted serious campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Judith Hope, the state party chairwoman, said the primary
results reflected Democrats' desire to beat the Republican
incumbents, fed by the losses of recent elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a perception by the voters that these
candidates have the best chance to win the general election,'' said
Judith Hope, the state party chairwoman. ``More than ever before,
even among extremely liberal, highly ideological Democratic voters,
there is a new degree of pragmatism. Maybe the Democratic Party has
finally matured and come of age. We've grown up.''
</P>
<P>
   She conceded that voters' judgments of which candidates would be
strongest in the general election were based, in large part, on how
much money they had.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman Keith Wright of Harlem, a liberal who supported the
more centrist Vallone, said: ``We got tired of losing. It used to
be the liberal would win the primary and then would get killed in
the general. Maybe we've learned something.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hank Morris, a political consultant who is working for
Schumer, maintained that polls prove that ``people don't vote
strategically, they vote for their favorite candidate.''
</P>
<P>
   And Cuomo offered his own explanation why money matters more
now: Liberalism, he said, is not dead, but it is in hiding. Since
the Republican sweep of 1994, he said, Democrats from Clinton to
local officials have been afraid to voice the left-leaning views
they hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``That makes it very hard to keep the liberals motivated,'' he
said. ``They're still out there, but they're quiet.''
</P>
<P>
   In that silence, he said, money is heard more loudly than ever.

MURIEL HUMPHREY BROWN, 86, PROMINENT POLITICAL WIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By IRVIN MOLOTSKY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl
from South Dakota into a confident woman during political campaigns
for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to
fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died Sunday at
Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived
in Plymouth, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   The office of her son, Hubert Humphrey III, the Minnesota
attorney general, said only that she died of natural causes after
having been admitted to the hospital earlier in the day.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public, but on
Tuesday she stood at the side of her son, Hubert Humphrey III,
Minnesota's attorney general, when he won the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's
victory.
</P>
<P>
   There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel
Humphrey, and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as vice
president under Lyndon B. Johnson, he lost to Richard Nixon in 1968
when Johnson decided against seeking re-election.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's presidential
nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her
husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning
to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed
him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.
</P>
<P>
   Because of her shyness she had to work at the roles that came to
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,''
she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for president in
1968, ``well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of.
I just wanted to be a wife.''
</P>
<P>
   Hubert H. Humphrey ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it
was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the
constant campaigner of the constant candidate.
</P>
<P>
   The Humphreys had met in the early 1930's when Muriel was a
student at Huron College. They married in 1936, and Mrs. Humphrey
worked as a bookkeeper at a utility company to put her husband
through college.
</P>
<P>
   In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief
time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs
that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman
to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born
mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with
mental disabilities.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism,
Muriel Humphrey responded: ``There's something I've been wanting to
say for a long time. I'm a liberal, and I'm proud of it. In fact, I
was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted
to say that.''
</P>
<P>
   By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown,
a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been a classmate in Huron.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband and her son Hubert III, Mrs. Brown is
survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob
and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren and
three great-grandchildren.

EDWIN A. WEINSTEIN, 89, NEUROPSYCHIATRIST WHO STUDIED PRESIDENT
WILSON 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., N.Y.)  (lh) 
 By FORD BURKHART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dr. Edwin A. Weinstein, a former neuropsychiatrist at Mount
Sinai Medical School in New York City who maintained that people,
even presidents, go to extraordinary lengths to hide their
illnesses, died Sept. 7 at his home in Bethesda, Md. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a stroke, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein's study of President Woodrow Wilson argued that Wilson
carried with him into the White House ``psychological baggage''
resulting from illnesses, which explained some of his policy
positions and even his figures of speech.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Woodrow Wilson: A Medical and Psychological
Biography'' (Princeton University Press, 1981), Weinstein
emphasized that Wilson's family called the future president lazy as
a child because he had dyslexia, a form of reading impairment. His
guilt over that, Weinstein said, helped explain Wilson's often
troubled relationships with those around him from the time he
became president of Princeton University in 1902.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein argued that while Wilson, the 28th president, was
campaigning for the League of Nations in 1919, he sought to keep
secret his physical collapse, which was caused by a clogged blood
vessel, and pushed himself and others to work even harder to
compensate.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein used letters written by Wilson to analyze the effects
of the series of strokes that Wilson suffered beginning in 1898.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that after the president's doctors diagnosed his
cardiac failure, Wilson pleaded for the League of Nations as a way
to cut out ``the heart of the war'' _ the neglect of needs of
smaller nations _ or else ``that heart is going to live and beat
and grow stronger,'' and more war would follow.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein was convinced that Wilson's denial of his illnesses
contributed to ``his inability to recognize new answers'' and the
way Europeans manipulated him after World War I, said a longtime
colleague, Dr. Robert Cohn of Howard University Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein also studied Wilson's extramarital relationship with
Mary Peck when he was president, noting that when the affair was
finally over, Wilson, sensitive to the pain he had inflicted on his
wife, Ellen, set higher policy goals for his next years.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein wrote of Wilson: ``No longer pure in his personal
life, he would devote himself to the service of others and to
purifying politics.'' Just as Wilson used ``the metaphors of
revitalization and regeneration of Princeton'' after his strokes,
Weinstein wrote, he used ``the dogmas of the new morality'' to cope
as president with a guilty conscience after his affair.
</P>
<P>
   Later in his career, Weinstein studied Ronald Reagan's
presidency and, contradicting the White House doctors, concluded
that Reagan suffered Alzheimer's symptoms, like loss of memory,
that left him at times unaware of world affairs, Cohn said.
</P>
<P>
   Reagan disclosed his Alzheimer's in 1994. His doctors afterward
argued that Reagan did not exhibit any symptoms during his
presidency, which ended in January 1989. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein's collaborator in studies of Alzheimer's over a period
of 25 years, Dr. Robert Friedland, an associate professor of
neurology at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, said
both of them were convinced that the Constitution's 25th Amendment,
which governs presidential disability and succession, gave
inadequate protection to the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Weinstein believed that neurologists should be members of
medical teams created to evaluate a president regularly, Friedland
said, because White House doctors often lack full awareness of
Alzheimer's, whose early symptoms can be difficult to detect.
</P>
<P>
   After President Kennedy's assassination, Weinstein was invited
by the federal Office of Science and Technology to help officials
there recognize serious threats to presidents' lives. He told the
officials that ``socially isolated'' people who considered
assassination heroic were as a rule the most dangerous. He also
worked for the Central Intelligence Agency on how to tell which
terrorist threats should be taken seriously, and how to predict the
effects of illnesses of foreign leaders on world affairs.
</P>
<P>
   Edwin Weinstein was born in Manhattan and received his B.A. from
Dartmouth College and his M.D. from Northwestern University Medical
School.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York
from 1947 to 1954, then went to Washington to study brain injuries
and other disorders at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research
in 1954. In the late 1950s, he was clinical and research director
of the Virgin Islands Bureau of Mental Health.
</P>
<P>
   He taught at the Washington School of Psychiatry from 1960 to
1968, when he became a professor of neurology at Mount Sinai
Medical School, remaining there to his retirement in 1977.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote ``Denial of Illness'' with Robert L. Kahn (1955), and
``Cultural Aspects of Delusion'' (1962).  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   His first wife, Helen Emerson Strong, died in 1970. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Survivors include his wife, Anne; two children from his first
marriage, Robert Weinstein, of San Francisco, and Lucy Emerson
Haagen, of Durham, N.C., and two grandchildren.

GLENN FAST REGAINING LOST CONFIDENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ All week Tennessee Oilers safety Blaine
Bishop kept asking Chris Sanders about his former Ohio State
teammate, Terry Glenn. The question was always the same.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for him, so was the answer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how fast he was,'' the Oilers safety said a few minutes
after he had learned Glenn was too fast for him to tackle when he
most needed to. ``We got Sanders. I kept asking him, `Now, how fast
is he?' He kept saying, `Very fast. Very, very fast. Real fast.'''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn was so fast Sunday that when he made a sight adjustment on
an Oiler blitz with just under five minutes to play in a game the
New England Patriots were in danger of losing, he ran away with the
ball and the game after running away from a flat-footed Bishop in
the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's jets turned a short slant into a 51-yard touchdown that
gave the Patriots their first lead in a 27-16 victory and allowed
Oiler running back Eddie George to see a live replay of something
he had hoped to keep only in his memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing him, when the game is on the line like that, I knew
they'd go to him sooner or later,'' said the Oilers running back,
also a former Ohio State teammate of Glenn's. ``And the nightmare
happened. I saw him catch the ball, and we didn't tackle him. I
knew what he could do with the ball ... and he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn's current teammates know what he can do with it as well,
but many of them had grown anxious waiting for it to happen this
season. Frustrated after two long weeks in which he had dropped
four passes, including three last Sunday against the Colts, Glenn
acknowledged that his confidence had begun to wane a bit as he
continued to search for the breakthrough game that could get him
back into the zone he occupied in his miracle rookie season, when
he caught 90 passes for 1,132 yards three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   That feeling eluded him much of last season when it seemed one
injury after another dogged him, and this fall it hadn't yet
appeared either, although he and quarterback Drew Bledsoe have been
laboring hard to find it.
</P>
<P>
   ``My first game, in Denver, I dropped a ball and then last week
I struggled,'' Glenn said after a day in which he not only went 51
yards for the winning touchdown but finished with four catches for
102 yards, his first 100-yard game since last Oct. 27, when he made
seven catches for 163 yards against the Packers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't felt like myself yet. In practice, Drew and I have
tried to get it but we haven't quite yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday's game, Bledsoe approached Glenn and told him this
was to be the day that would change. With a bright sun, clear
skies, and an aggressive defense that loved to blitz and thus made
itself vulnerable to seeing short slants turned into long gains,
Bledsoe assured Glenn the football would be coming his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to him and let him know he could be a key for us,''
Bledsoe said. ``Sometimes you go to a guy and challenge him. Terry
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for us to get Terry involved not so much for
him but for our offense. Today I told him it was time for him to
have a big game. They were daring us to pass.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a dare that led to Bledsoe being sacked four times but it
also led to Glenn's score because he read the safety blitz
immediately and knew that meant he should change a deep post into a
quick slant. When Glenn broke off his pattern, he expected to see
the cornerback on his side jump the slant but Tennessee's scheme
called for him to lay back instead, leaving Bishop, the strong
safety, to make the tackle in the middle of the field.
</P>
<P>
   But almost before Bishop could react, Glenn was angling across
the field and by him, going from left to right so fast he was past
Bishop before the safety was close enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I got by Bishop I knew I could go a long ways,'' Glenn
said.
</P>
<P>
   Go he did, continuing almost to the opposite sideline before
Shawn Jefferson blocked cornerback Denard Walker, the last Oiler
with a chance at Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   As Walker fought off Jefferson's block, Glenn accelerated
through his arms and was gone, tumbling into the end zone with the
ball over his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original play was intended to go long,'' Glenn said. ``I
expected that cornerback to come up and take away the slant or just
make the tackle. When he didn't, I was open and Drew led me perfect
so I could catch it on the run at full speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw when I came across the field that it could go a long
ways. Those are the kind of plays that can go a long ways.''
</P>
<P>
   They can when the ball gets into Glenn's hands in stride, where
Bledsoe put it Sunday. At such a moment, he is one of the most
dangerous pass receivers in the NFL, a player with sprinter's speed
and wide, strong hands that easily can pluck a football out of the
air and deposit it in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   But ever since that 90-catch rookie year, Glenn has been dogged
not only by nagging injuries but even more by the number itself, a
number that fans and critics seem to insist he match lest his
season become a failure.
</P>
<P>
   It is an absurd standard considering how few receivers in the
75-year history of the NFL ever have had such a season. Even though
it is one Glenn is well capable of eclipsing when the conditions
are right, numbers can become an albatross if not understood and
carefully analyzed, so they remain numbers and not some false
standard of excellence.
</P>
<P>
   As linebacker Chris Slade said, ``Terry is a great, great
player. He has to have the ball in his hands. But because of his
rookie year and all his talent, people put too much pressure on
him. He's only one man and he's still a young man.''
</P>
<P>
   He is a young man burdened with great expectations, expectations
fueled by those 90 catches in 1996. In some ways, everything came
so easy for him in '96 that his employers and his fans took for
granted that such a year was the floor for Glenn, not the ceiling.
When injuries limited him to nine games and 27 catches last year,
people began to grumble. And when he got off to a slow start this
fall, his name kept coming up followed by question marks, not
exclamation points.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of thing that began to weigh upon him this
summer until Ben Coates, who in 1994 set a tight end receiving
record with 96 catches and has been judged by that year ever since,
approached him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the first year I had, it's kind of hard to accept
anything less,'' Glenn said. ``I was hidden by a lot of things
then. I could just go out and do what I could. Now I'm expected to
do more things. But Ben told me to let the game come to me. He told
me to let it (90 catches) go.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday Terry Glenn did that, and soon enough he was on his own,
running free with the football in his hand and the game on the
line. At that moment, Eddie George knew what was coming and Blaine
Bishop was just getting an idea how fast ``very, very fast'' can
be.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday it was too fast for the Tennessee Oilers.

ANGEL FANS SLEEP THROUGH PENNANT RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB KEISSER  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It isn't exactly a news bulletin to report that Angels fans are
among the most blas in baseball. The Big Ed can sometimes be a lot
colder than the ice at the Pond across the street.
</P>
<P>
   But at this particular intersection of the 1998 season, which
brings the alleged home team and its opposition together at high
speed, the fans' collective coma screams for attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, the Angels beat Seattle 3-1 to tie the Texas
Rangers for the American League West lead with a week left to play
and the Rangers coming to town for the next three nights. This is
about as delicious as a baseball pennant race can get.
</P>
<P>
   Angel fans apparently aren't hungry. There reportedly were
42,972 of them at the stadium Sunday evening, but one wouldn't know
it by the decibel count. It wasn't until the ninth inning that the
fans got animated, and even then it was with the urging of the
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   And by then, maybe 10,000 of them already had called it a night
and left for home. At 7 p.m. On a Sunday. With no traffic concerns.
With Ken Griffey still in the game. If you can't stick around for
that, why bother coming at all?
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty quiet out there at times,'' said Tim Salmon, the
Long Beach product who, with Mike Piazza exiled to New York, is the
best day-in, day-out player in Southern California. ``We had a full
house, but there wasn't that buzz like you get in East Coast
parks.''
</P>
<P>
   That's buzz, as in excitement, as opposed to the ganja buzz at
old Raider Coliseum crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've been to the east, you know what the fans can do,''
Salmon continued. ``You come to bat in the ninth inning, with their
closer on the mound, and you can't help but feel the excitement.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't get that here. I know there are passionate season
ticket holders here. I know a lot of fans who are excited for us.
But even in the ninth inning tonight, it's different.''
</P>
<P>
   There was plenty for fans to appreciate. The Angels dropped two
games behind Friday night, but pitched the Mariners tough Saturday
and Sunday to draw even in the race and bring the Texas series to a
head.
</P>
<P>
   Omar Olivares stranded nine Mariners in the first six innings.
The Angels ran the Mariners ragged for three runs in the third. Ken
Griffey went hitless. Troy Percival pitched a 1-2-3 ninth. What's
not to cheer?
</P>
<P>
   Considering what this team has endured this season, you'd think
the faithful wouldn't need a goose. The Angels lead baseball in
disabled list transactions this season. They are currently without
Darin Erstad. Salmon has played in 131 games this season despite a
knife in his left foot (plantar fascia).
</P>
<P>
   The Angels have used a platoon at catcher and second base all
season, and have stayed in contention with only two pitchers,
Percival and Chuck Finley, with a history of consistent service.
</P>
<P>
   Olivares, 5-2 through mid-June, went 0-5 with a 8.38 ERA in
July. Jerrod Washburn, who stymied a rally by retiring Griffey and
Edgar Martinez in the seventh, was making only the third relief
appearance of his pro career. Steve Sparks and his poofball will
throw tonight, and Terry Collins will take applications for
Wednesday's game if Ken Hill can't start.
</P>
<P>
   Dodger fans would be delirious if their team had this kind of
heart and guile. They would donate a kidney to have a closer with
the intensity of Percival.
</P>
<P>
   Angel fans either don't care or are too conditioned to past
failures 1982, 1986, 1995 to get too close. In the seventh, Griffey
sent a fly ball deep to left with two men on, and the deep breath
the crowd took was audible. At least half expected it to go out,
because this is what they've come to expect.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tomorrow is why you play this game,'' said Terry Collins,
whose feelings never need prompting. ``To get into the postseason
and be in this situation, the race in our yard, in our hands, is
what it's all about. This is fun.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there are a lot of people who don't think we have a
chance. I'd love to have the fans standing and yelling every inning
the way they did tonight in the ninth. But I don't know if it
really makes a difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Salmon says it couldn't hurt. The Angels got one break Sunday,
when Lou Pinella asked Griffey to sacrifice. He popped a bunt up.
Johnny Oates is unlikely to give the bunt sign to Juan Gonzalez
this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot of excitement and emotion this week,'' Salmon
said. ``We need that tenth guy. We don't have the luxury of the
league's best lineup or the league's best pitching staff. We need
that intensity.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fans here will get excited when we get a rally going. But
a crowd can also initiate a rally. That's what we need for the last
three home games of the season.''
</P>
<P>
   Simply stated, it's put up or shut up time. And the fans have
already shown they can shut up.

OILERS DONE IN BY PATRIOTS' ONE-MINUTE DRILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Pete Carroll looked through the crowd of
reporters toward the podium in the makeshift interview room that
doubles as the Patriots' weight room as Terry Glenn began speaking
in a rare postgame session with the media.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great to see him up there,'' said the beaming coach.
``It's great to see Terry make a play like that, especially in the
fourth quarter. That was a tough game and we won a tough game. I
think that says a lot for our football team and the people we have
making plays when it really counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was right. The Patriots may have stumbled for parts of
three quarters, ever so fortunate to be tied, 6-6, at the half and
trailing just 16-13 in the final quarter. But in the end, Drew
Bledsoe fired a 51-yard touchdown pass/-run to Glenn for the
winning score. It was topped off by Lawyer Milloy's 30-yard
interception return for a touchdown 18 seconds later as the
Patriots finished off the Tennessee Oilers, 27-16, before 59,973
fans, most of whom didn't leave till the end.
</P>
<P>
   The win enabled the Patriots, who have not committed a turnover
this season, to head into the off week 2-1 having sampled the
cream-of-the-crop Denver Broncos, the pushover Indianapolis Colts,
and the middle-of-the-road Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Drew and Terry really set it off,'' said Ty Law, who
intercepted a pass at the end of the game and did a fine job in
coverage of Yancey Thigpen, an old nemesis of the Patriots. ``Once
they scored, the defense just started to get cranked up. Lawyer
made a big play, Chris Slade made a big hit at the end (on running
back Rodney Thomas), and it really showed how our team can rise to
the occasion.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who were anxious to see Bledsoe (18 for 30, 250 yards, no
interceptions for the third straight game) lead a fourth-quarter
drive to bring his team from behind had to be satisfied.
</P>
<P>
   The defense had pushed the Oilers back from their 20, where
they'd started a drive with 7:47 left to play, to the 13. A big
third-down hit by Tedy Bruschi on Eddie George for a 4-yard loss
was huge.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots took over on their 45 following a punt, and in two
plays they turned the game around.
</P>
<P>
   Rookie running back Robert Edwards, who later would break a
53-yarder, busted up the middle for 4 yards before Bledsoe and
Glenn connected.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a slant,'' said Glenn. ``Drew and I were on the same
vibe. He read the blitz and I read the blitz. The key was for him
to get the ball off. He did it. He just got me the ball and I just
ran.''
</P>
<P>
   Glenn, who led Patriots receivers with four catches for 102
yards, caught the pass at the Tennessee 45 and ran past one
defender before getting a key block at the 5 from Shawn Jefferson,
who took out cornerback Denard Walker, allowing Glenn to leap into
the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told Terry before the game, `Listen, it's time for you to
have a big game.' Terry responded. I wish everybody would not worry
about Terry. Terry's fine,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   For three quarters, the Oilers were content to let George pound
away against a defense that was spending a lot of time on the
field.
</P>
<P>
   If New England's defense was tired _ it spent 36:30 on the field
_ because of the heat and humidity, it wasn't showing it,
especially late.
</P>
<P>
   After the Glenn touchdown, the Oilers took over at their 20.
Steve McNair threw over Willie Davis's head on first down, then
tried to get the ball to Thigpen, but Milloy was there to intercept
a poorly thrown ball and run it back for the score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the NFL and they (Tennessee) have a lot of heart,'' said
safety Willie Clay. ``It's a matter of gaining maturity for them.''
</P>
<P>
   If it was a matter of the Oilers needing to gain maturity, did
that mean the Patriots had matured?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it says a lot for us,'' said Clay. ``To win a game in
the fourth quarter, that's important to a team after a battle like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides the Bledsoe-to-Glenn play and the Milloy interception,
another key play was Derrick Cullors's 8-yard gain on a flip pass
from Bledsoe during a 10-play, 77-yard scoring drive that tied the
game at 13 with 5:41 remaining in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Cullors caught the flip as Bledsoe was about to be hit on third
and 4 from the Patriots 29, avoided one tackler, and got the first
down.
</P>
<P>
   ``He heard me call his name and he threw me the ball,'' said
Cullors. ``He just kind of flipped it to me. At that point everyone
was saying that play changed the pace of things, but I was just
trying to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe connected with Glenn for 27 yards and with Vincent
Brisby for 16. On third and 5 at the 15, Bledsoe connected with old
reliable Ben Coates for a 6-yard gain. On first and goal from the
9, the Patriots, who had the run the ball only six times in the
first half, committed to running it in. Edwards ran for 2 and then
for 7 tough yards and the tying score.
</P>
<P>
   ``It showed me they believed in me,'' said Edwards, who gained
92 yards on 12 carries for a 7.7-yard average.
</P>
<P>
   Al Del Greco, who kicked three field goals, put the Oilers ahead
for the final time with a 45-yarder with 10:54 remaining in the
game.
</P>
<P>
   In the first half, the teams exchanged field goals to make it a
6-6 game at intermission. The Patriots were quite fortunate. The
defense spent 19:50 of the 30 minutes on the field. And though it
allowed the Oilers to go 5 for 9 on third-down conversions, the New
England defense didn't allow them in the end zone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time they scored, we came back,'' said Brisby. ``That is
how we are. We don't give up. We keep coming.''

SOMETHING MISSING FOR HOLYFIELD

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ It was the usual wild and incoherent scene inside the
ring after a Don King-promoted heavyweight title fight.
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn Bean, a proud and game fighter only moments earlier, was
now irate. Butch Lewis, Bean's promoter, was screaming at referee
Brian Garry. Cameras flashed. King was pushing his way through the
melee to defend Garry. Microphones and videocams were thrust in
front of many a face. Garry was defending himself. Evander
Holyfield was being paraded around the ring, arms raised high in
victory. Much of the boxing world got through those ropes and into
the ring.
</P>
<P>
   Except for the one boxer Holyfield apparently needs most of all
_ Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   Once again fighting someone other than Tyson Saturday night,
Holyfield looked more decent than dominant, more ordinary than
extraordinary, more an aging boxer than the vibrant heavyweight
champion of the world. ``The Champ Hits Home'' was how King billed
this homecoming bout for Holyfield against the lampooned Bean;
alas, it didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was clumsy and awkward,'' said Holyfield of Bean, and that
certainly was true of Bean's footwork. But Bean was far from clumsy
or awkward in how he stood up to Holyfield, taking the champ's best
punches early and even taking a controversial knockdown in the 10th
round. Even then, Holyfield couldn't take out Bean with an
uncontested, unprotected, unexpected short right to the temple as
Bean tried to extricate himself from the ropes.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took away my combinations,'' was one Holyfield analysis of
this fight that turned out much, much better than expected. ``He
slipped some jabs on me ... he got some good shots on me.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was a good left uppercut by Bean in the third
round, a good overhand right by him in the fifth, another solid
right in the eighth, and on and on. Followed by a flurry of shots
from Bean to Holyfield's head in the 12th and final round that gave
Bean the round on all judge's cards, when more than 41,000 fans in
the Georgia Dome were imploring Holyfield for a knockout.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to give the man credit,'' said Holyfield. ``The man
came here to fight and he went 12 rounds. He's a better boxer than
many people give him credit for.''
</P>
<P>
   Or is Holyfield no longer the boxer he was? Or does Holyfield
need Tyson to bring out his best?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why they fight the fight,'' boomed King. ``People gave
Bean no chance, but look what he did once he got into the ring.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield complained that Bean was hitting him with rabbit
punches, ``but the ref didn't want to do anything about them.''
Even more, though, Holyfield was frustrated by Bean's style. Bean
was awkward, repeated the champ, ``and I couldn't get off my
combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Bean nor Holyfield had the punch to take the other out.
So Bean was left with that impossible situation _ try to win by a
decision over Holyfield in Holyfield's hometown _ and it was no
surprise that Holyfield took a unanimous decision. Two judges
scored the bout 117-110, one 116-111, for Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I won the fight,'' said Bean, an opinion not shared
by any in the media or anyone not wearing a red turban, Bean's
trademark attire. ``I put up a lot of pressure and I brought a lot
of pressure on. I had him on the ropes (several times) and I hit
him with a lot of good shots.''
</P>
<P>
   No, Holyfield tried to argue against the evidence, he was not
old, not rusty, and not overconfident. Holyfield just was not
fighting Mike Tyson.
</P>
<P>
   On the undercard, Johnny Ruiz of Methuen, Mass., made an
extremely strong move into the upper echelon of heavyweights by
taking out Jerry Ballard with a TKO in the fourth round. King, who
recently took on Ruiz's contract, was ecstatic, saying that Ruiz
``is now ready to take on Lennox Lewis,'' the World Boxing Council
champ.

NOT MUCH FOR SOSA TO CELEBRATE

<P>
   CHICAGO _ What has happened to Sammy Sosa? On the most important
day of his baseball career he couldn't find a way to dig out of a
rut, and neither could the Chicago Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa and Co. had yet another bad outing Sunday, resulting in a
7-3 loss and a three-game sweep by the Cincinnati Reds. It couldn't
have come at a worse time for Sosa or the crowd of 40,117 lured by
the home run race and the dogfight the Cubs are in for the
wild-card slot in the National League playoffs. The Mets beat
Florida, 5-0, Sunday and now have a one-game lead.
</P>
<P>
   Sosa went 0 for 5 on ``Sammy Sosa Celebration Day,'' making him
0 for 17 since he hit home run No. 63 last Wednesday. Some
celebration. He began the day trailing Mark McGwire of the
Cardinals by one homer, but he's now trailing by two after McGwire
hit No. 65 Sunday in Milwaukee against the Brewers. McGwire's home
run, as if an omen, was hit during the middle of the Sosa
presentation.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago lost to Cincinnati in part because of three home runs by
Bret Boone, the last of which appeared to be foul down the
left-field line. No matter. The way things went for Sammy and the
Cubs Sunday, finishing at Milwaukee and Houston might be a better
alternative than the pressure-cooker the club has played in for the
last three days.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing by one game with five to go, Chicago plays the Brewers
Tuesday and Wednesday, and that could help. Sosa has hit 10 home
runs against Milwaukee this year. Then there are three games in
Houston, and the Cubbies won't have to face Randy Johnson. New York
has two games left at home against Montreal and finishes the season
at Atlanta against Bruce Chen, Tom Glavine, and Greg Maddux.
</P>
<P>
   The home run race is important. But Chicago's goal is to make
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't lose sight of the fact the other team is trying to
win ballgames, too,'' said Cubs manager Jim Riggleman. ``They're
not going to give you the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa was showered with gifts, including a 1998 Chrysler
convertible. Commissioner Bud Selig presented him with a trophy for
hitting his home runs and beating Roger Maris's record of 61 homers
in a season, set in 1961, even though McGwire was first. McGwire
sent a note of congratulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cincinnati played great,'' said Sosa. ``They came and played
like a first-place team. Every mistake that we made they
capitalized on it. Nothing you can do about it. I had three days
without a hit. I'm coming back. I'm not giving up yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Sosa at first tried to deny the distractions had affected him.
But eventually he admitted that he was pressing and swinging at bad
pitches.
</P>
<P>
   At least Sosa was happy for a little while with the festivities,
which were attended by Michael Jordan. After a half-hour program,
he romped around Wrigley Field, a la Carl Yastrzemski in his Boston
retirement party.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt great,'' he said. ``I did romp around the field to
show the fans how much I love them. I was real happy that the fans
showed me their appreciation today.''

<P>
   Linda Gillick began her quest convinced that science and a
little common sense could explain why in one ordinary patch of New
Jersey seashore, an unusual number of children, her son Michael
among them, have similar types of cancers.
</P>
<P>
   She reasoned that it must be something in the water or air, some
unnoticed chemical lurking under a toxic-waste dump or factory _
but in any case, a specific factor that she assumed could be
located, analyzed and then eradicated.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have something that is grossly abnormal, you need to
find out the indicator that is different from somewhere else,''
said Mrs. Gillick, who organized a movement that persuaded the
state to make a comprehensive environmental study of her town, Toms
River, and of surrounding Dover Township in Ocean County. ``What do
we have that's different? That's the key.''
</P>
<P>
   As logical as it may sound, Mrs. Gillick's assumption represents
a challenge to science's traditional approach to cancer clusters.
Many scientists say that there is a lot of cancer everywhere and
that neighborhood concentrations of the disease result from chance,
not from the environment. But people who live in areas where the
incidence of cancer is higher than expected have rarely been
content with that explanation.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these people are turning their discontent into political
action. Armed with the clout that gave them an audience with
President Clinton in August and a starring role in some of New York
Sen. Alfonse D'Amato's re-election campaign advertisements, they
have become a driving force behind tens of millions of dollars'
worth of new research into cancer clusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is pushing science to a new era _ of ecogenetic
epidemiology,'' which looks at geographical variations of disease,
said Ruth Allen, an environmental epidemiologist with the Federal
Environmental Protection Agency. She is the agency's project leader
for a $21 million study of elevated breast cancer rates on Long
Island, N.Y. ``This is where molecular biomarkers of disease and
geographical variations are examined together.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the United States, health officials are re-examining old
monitoring data, using newly refined techniques to search for
chemicals that may not have been looked at in earlier air, water
and soil tests in communities where cancer clusters are suspected.
</P>
<P>
   An array of ambitious studies are under way using plain gumshoe
detective work combined with computer mapping that can fine-tune
the picture of what is in a community's environment, identify how
people might be exposed to synthetic chemicals and determine
whether small amounts of such chemicals may be toxic to humans.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the investigation of certain childhood cancers in
Dover Township and breast cancer on Long Island, there are
statewide studies of cancer and chemical use in Connecticut and
California, a federal study of elevated breast cancer deaths in
mid-Atlantic and Northeast states, and federal studies of childhood
and adult brain cancers near toxic-waste sites in several states.
</P>
<P>
   Cancer clusters _ the term is used to describe
higher-than-expected concentrations of similar cancers in one
discrete area _ have been in the national vocabulary for decades.
They can be difficult to document with standard statistical
analysis. Sometimes the data involve such small numbers of cases
that epidemiologists cannot reach a conclusion about whether an
anomaly exists. Sometimes, according to the National Cancer
Institute, scientists find ``a true excess,'' but cannot explain
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many types of cancer and birth defects that just
by chance alone you'd expect any one of them to be high in any one
little town,'' said Dr. Bruce Ames, a biochemist and molecular
biologist who directs the National Institute of Environmental
Health Sciences Center at the University of California at Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Expressing a view widely held in the scientific world, he said
that the money devoted to research into environmental links to
cancer is misspent and that there is ``no convincing evidence''
that synthetic chemicals in the atmosphere are an important cause
of cancer in humans. ``I'd put my money into basic research, not
into chasing hypothetical risks,'' Ames said.
</P>
<P>
   Like a growing number of citizen activists, the Gillick family
was not willing to have Dover Township's record of childhood
cancers written off as a statistical fluke. The township in
southern New Jersey has had 90 cases over a 12-year period,
compared with the 67 cases that New Jersey health officials said
could be expected during that time.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important to look at everything _ the water, the soil,
the air, all of it, and try to find an answer,'' said Michael
Gillick, who was found to have neuroblastoma, a cancer that affects
the nervous system, when he was 3{ months old.
</P>
<P>
   Now 19, his growth stunted and his body painfully contorted by
the disease, he said he realizes that all the research may never
tell him why he, or any other cancer victim, is sick. ``It's too
late for me,'' Gillick said. ``I already have what I have. I accept
it. It's my wish that this not happen to others.''
</P>
<P>
   Public clamor for answers has prodded many states, including New
York and New Jersey, to process and publish cancer data faster.
</P>
<P>
   In April, for example, the New York state Assembly appropriated
$1 million for a comprehensive statewide cancer-mapping project. It
was to correlate the types and locations of specific cancers,
information already assembled in the state cancer registry, with
neighborhood-specific data on past and present water quality,
pesticide and chemical emissions, radiation exposure, industrial
pollution and local toxic-waste sites.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gov. George Pataki vetoed the appropriation, he
promised that the Health Department would do the study from its own
budget. But a department spokeswoman, Claire Pospisil, then said it
could not create a meaningful map until it upgraded the registry.
This year the department published data from 1994 for the registry;
its goal is to have 1996 data assembled and published by the end of
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Many states, including Hawaii, Illinois and California, have
undertaken statewide cancer-mapping projects. The proliferation of
cancer mapping reflects a growing trend nationwide to integrate two
sets of data that are widely and publicly available: one on
toxic-chemical releases and the other on geographical variations in
the incidence of some diseases. The trend follows a decade of
intense focus on cancer risk factors like diet, lifestyle and
heredity.

</P>
<P>
   ``Communities now are saying we don't have any of these risk
factors, and still we have a problem,'' said Dr. Allen of the
Environmental Protection Agency. ``They ask common-sense questions
that are at once simple and profound.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Allen said that ``scientists have new tools and new
hypotheses that they are testing,'' but that the political impetus
for environmental research came after cancer-cluster activists in
places like Toms River and Long Island presented elected officials
with raw data from their own homemade cancer maps. Politicians have
responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``They now look at graphical information and say: `Gee, in my
district it's this number and in yours it's that. What's going
on?''' Dr. Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   Policy-makers have acted on perceived health risks that are
considered merely hypothetical by the scientific establishment. The
surgeon-general first recommended putting warnings on cigarette
packs in 1964, when the American Medical Association did not yet
consider smoking the main cause of cancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the Long Island breast-cancer study, the federal government
is sponsoring more than a dozen studies that focus heavily on the
possible role of environmental factors in the high breast-cancer
rates in parts of the island..
</P>
<P>
   Some try to correlate cancer incidence with historical data on
wind patterns, groundwater flow and the accumulation of pesticides
over time in the soil. Others involve new toxicological tests on
220 chemicals that might be found on Long Island. Half of them were
added to the list at the demand of local activists.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, when the New Jersey authorities were pressed two
years ago investigate what some experts said was a statistically
unusual incidence of some childhood cancers in Dover Township, they
agreed to look for 235 substances instead of the 85 they usually
monitor in drinking water.
</P>
<P>
   In the course of the testing, they found traces of a chemical
compound, or trimer, that is a byproduct of styrene and
acrylonitrile. Both chemicals, used for decades in local factories,
are listed as carcinogens by the EPA.
</P>
<P>
   The route to the water system, according to preliminary research
results, appears to be from a Superfund toxic-waste dump, which
received waste from these factories, less than one mile from a well
field serving Dover Township.
</P>
<P>
   When New Jersey officials examined old records of what was in
the drinking water, they said they found that the compound had been
present for at least 10 years. It was not investigated further,
because it was not on the list of state and federally regulated
pollutants. The trimer is now being tested to determine if it is a
human carcinogen.
</P>
<P>
   It is too early to draw any conclusions about whether there is a
relationship between human cancers and the trimer, said James
Blumenstock, acting senior assistant commissioner of the state
Department of Health and Senior Services. But he said the study is
prompting a reassessment of which and how many chemicals should be
regulated. ``As science advances,'' he said, ``our ability to
measure and detect contaminants will improve.''
</P>
<P>
   Public pressure to conduct the Dover Township study also focused
attention on the New Jersey cancer registry, which was found to be
too out of date to be useful. The data bank has since been updated,
and the state Assembly passed a law that set fines of up to $1,000
a day for medical personnel who fail to file timely reports of
cancer cases.
</P>
<P>
   Dover Township's study is only one of many efforts to take a
fresh look at childhood cancer and possible risks to children from
chemicals in the environment.
</P>
<P>
   The National Cancer Institute, for example, is financing a
pioneering study in California of potential links between
pesticides and childhood cancers. It was spurred by the discovery
of an unexpectedly high number of brain cancers in children in the
Central Valley town of McFarland.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we realized how impossible it is to explain why any one
cluster exists, we tried to step back from looking at specific
clusters and look at the big picture, whether there are patterns of
risk we should be paying attention to,'' said Peggy Reynolds, chief
of the environmental epidemiology and geographic information system
section of the state health department.
</P>
<P>
   The momentum behind cluster studies caught other health
officials off guard. Mary Lerchen, an epidemiologist with the
cancer surveillance branch of the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention, said the federal centers cannot keep track of the
ballooning number of studies and is seeking money to set up a
cancer-cluster registry that could coordinate research findings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seldom have we found the cause of a cancer because a cluster
brought it to our attention,'' Dr. Lerchen said, ``but you never
know, and you certainly can't start out with that attitude.''

FAMILIES DISCOVER RELATIVES WERE BURIED IN LANDFILL 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By VIVIAN S. TOY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The only comfort that Angel Mendoza could find when
he buried his older brother, Melvin, four years ago was the thought
that he at least had laid him to rest in a beautiful place.
</P>
<P>
   Perched on top of a hill in Cypress Hills Cemetery, a sprawling
200-acre site that straddles Queens and Brooklyn, the elder Mendoza
would own in death something he would have marveled at in life: a
stunning panorama of Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   That's why devastated does not begin to describe what Angel
Mendoza felt when he learned a year later that the hill was
actually an illegal landfill made up of construction and demolition
debris. He and hundreds like him were horrified at the thought that
they had buried their loved ones in someone else's trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``We couldn't believe it,'' Mendoza said. ``How could they do
this to people, especially when they were vulnerable and
grieving?''
</P>
<P>
   Some of the 1,000 families with loved ones on the hill known as
Terrace Meadow opted to move them. Others decided to let the dead
remain because cemetery officials assured them the mound was
stable.
</P>
<P>
   The relative peace of mind for those who kept their deceased
relatives on the hill was shattered in July when a state Supreme
Court justice ruled that the 50-foot mound was structurally unsound
and ordered nearly 700 families to dig up their dead. Lawyers for
families and the cemetery are trying to negotiate a plan for moving
the remaining graves.
</P>
<P>
   The building of Terrace Meadow reflects two trends in the city's
business of death: the need for more burial space and the drive to
adapt to changing demographics.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of Cypress Hills Cemetery realized in 1986 that a hill
would not only add about 5,000 spaces, but would also cater to the
city's growing and aging Chinese population. They learned that
Chinese families would pay top dollar for high ground and
picturesque scenery, two requisites for auspicious feng shui, the
Chinese art of balancing the unseen forces of landscape and people.
</P>
<P>
   The earliest headstones on Terrace Meadow, most of them from
1992, belong to Chinese families. But in 1993, after the mound's
questionable composition was revealed, an Asian burial society that
had steered funeral homes to the hill dissolved, and Chinese
burials there stopped.
</P>
<P>
   There are now relatively few Chinese headstones left on the
hill. Most markers that remain on its two plateaus carry Hispanic
surnames and were placed between 1993 and 1995, when burials there
were banned. Some of those families have accused the cemetery of
discriminating against minorities by selling them plots on the hill
without explaining what it was made of.
</P>
<P>
   Cypress Hills Cemetery, which was established in 1848, is home
to the likes of Gentleman Jim Corbett, the 19th-century
prizefighter, Mae West and Jackie Robinson. In recent years, it has
become a popular cemetery for many immigrant groups.
</P>
<P>
   But the tortured history of Terrace Meadow now threatens to
overshadow the cemetery's credits.
</P>
<P>
   Lawsuits by families and the state attorney general's office are
still pending. State officials said Cypress Hills never got proper
permission to build the hill. And a court-appointed receiver took
over the cemetery's management in 1994 after state officials
discovered financial improprieties.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want the people who did this to be punished,'' said Eduardo
Landecho, a retired jewelry maker who buried his wife and his
mother on Terrace Meadow and who moved them elsewhere in the
cemetery earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
   Landecho, who has joined one lawsuit, said he and his family had
scraped together more than $11,000 to pay for the burials. ``I
sacrificed to give them a decent burial, and the cemetery just
disrespected me and my family,'' he said.

RIPKEN'S STREAK ENDS AFTER 2,632 GAMES 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ Maybe the Red Sox and Cubs are going to meet
in the World Series, folks. That's the only thing left in this
perfect baseball summer, a holy hardball season in which the
national pastime re-established itself as America's true love.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, on the day that one man hit his 65th (and he should have
had his 66th) home run, another man voluntarily stopped a streak
after playing in 2,632 consecutive games. Orioles third baseman Cal
Ripken, Jr., the man who pulled baseball from the gutter in the
post-strike summer of '95, walked into Oriole manager Ray Miller's
office and said it was time to end the streak. Ripken did this just
a couple of hours after Mark McGwire cranked home run No. 65.
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, but I can't believe I'm typing these numbers. Sixty-five
homers. Two-thousand, six-hundred, thirty-two consecutive games.
When I was a little kid we had 61 homers and 2,130 consecutive
games, and those records were going to last a lifetime. And now the
homer record is topped on a daily basis, and the consecutive-game
streak has succumbed to a new iron man who finally took a day off
with a week to go inon the next-to-last-day of the stardust season
of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken did not call in sick. He could have played. There was no
injury, no family crisis, no subpoena supeona from Kenneth Starr to
take him out of the lineup. No. He just decided it was time. He and
his team had become prisoners of the streak, so Rip did everyone a
favor and put it to bed.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine how hard this must have been. The guy played every game
since May 30, 1982, and could have played every game for who knows
how long? But folks looked at his sagging numbers (.273, 14 homers,
61 RBIs) and the Orioles' disappointing season and Ripken got
blamed for letting the streak drag everyone down.
</P>
<P>
   I talked to Ripken (yeesh, I hate it when I sound like Larry
King) about the stress of the streak when the Red Sox visited
Baltimore in July. At that time the streak was cited as the cause
of everything wrong with the Orioles and the iron man and his
manager were defensive about the touchy topic.
</P>
<P>
   ``It always amazes me,'' Ripken said July 10. ``At a low point
or a frustrating point, I wonder, `Why do I have to sit here and
actually defend the desire to go out and play?' I think it should
be the people that don't want to play that should have to defend
their position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is the streak the reason why we're losing? Is the streak the
reason why we won last year? The answer to both is no. It kind of
makes me laugh a little bit the way it is brought up. The issue
should be performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``The streak, like everything else, will take care of itself. If
something happens, it happens. It could end with an injury. It
could end in many different ways. When it presents itself, who
knows? How am I supposed to know how it will end?
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to play every day, you have to be worthy,'' said
Ripken. ``If at some point, you're not worthy, it ends. But so far
it hasn't. When I no longer deserve to be the everyday third
baseman, it'll end.
</P>
<P>
   ``Strip away everything and it's simple. I'm a baseball player.
I love being a baseball player. You have a small window in the
grand scheme of things to be a baseball player. You can't play
until you're 65. To me, I'm healthy and I want to play the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday night, he caved to the outside pressures and it must have
killed him. Ripken is a proud man, a 38-year-old son of a baseball
lifer. Cal Ripken Sr. never played a day in the big leagues, but he
is one of the toughest Birds to put on a uniform (Rip Sr. once took
a Black and Decker drill to his foot to relieve pressure caused by
an ingrown toenail) and he taught his son to go to work every day,
even when it hurt.
</P>
<P>
   We all could use a dose of the Ripken work ethic. You do your
job, you do it to the best of your ability, and you do it every
day.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken went to work every day for more than 16 seasons, and when
he finally stopped, it was only because of external pressure. Cal's
day off won't cure the Orioles' woes, or his season of mediocrity,
but it does eliminate any speculation that he and the Orioles are
more interested in history than in winning.
</P>
<P>
   There's nice symmetry in the fact that Ripken chose to sit on a
night the Orioles were playing the Yankees (when it became clear
Ripken wasn't playing, all of the 1998 Yankees went to the top step
of the dugout and applauded). Rookie Ryan Minor started in Ripken's
place, and goes down as the new Babe Dahlgren. It was Dahlgren who
stepped in for Gehrig in 1939.
</P>
<P>
   For a little perspective, consider that Ripken beat Gehrig's
record by 502 games, by more than three full seasons. Had Ripken
began his career the day after he broke Gehrig's record, he would
have been the active consecutive-game leader when he sat Sunday
night (now that Cal has hit the pine, Albert Belle is the ranking
iron man with 327 games).
</P>
<P>
   The Orioles come to Fenway Thursday night for the first of four
games. Red Sox fans won't have a chance to see Mark McGwire or
Sammy Sosa this week, but they ought to stand and applaud madly for
Ripken every chance they get. He is a part of baseball history. We
will not see his like again. Someone else might hit 68 or 70 home
runs in our lifetime, but Ripken's record of 2,632 consecutive
games should stand forever.

UNION'S CHIEF IS CHALLENGED ON CORRUPTION 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A fast-growing dissident movement at District Council
37, the giant union representing 120,000 New York City public
employees, is mounting a major challenge to Stanley Hill, the
union's executive director, demanding that he act decisively to
stop the corruption that has rocked the union.
</P>
<P>
   Upset that the Manhattan district attorney is investigating 12
of the district council's 56 locals, the dissidents assert that
Hill has done little to prevent financial scandals in which, union
investigators say, more than $3 million has disappeared from
various locals.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents are urging Hill to open the district council's
books and to provide tough oversight of its 56 locals to check
dishonest leaders and to catch them before their misspending or
embezzlement plunges union locals into the red.
</P>
<P>
   The insurgents are not mounting an electoral challenge to Hill,
who was re-elected to a new three-year term in January. Instead,
they are pressuring him to make fundamental changes in his
leadership, maintaining that he has adopted an anything-goes
attitude that has encouraged the leaders of some union locals to
overspend, embezzle and commit election fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``This place is a cesspool of corruption,'' said Mark Rosenthal,
a leader of Hill's critics and the newly elected president of a
local representing 2,400 city motor vehicle operators. ``We're
trying to save the union before the district attorney marches in
and people get the wrong impression about the union, and everyone
is branded a crook.''
</P>
<P>
   A major factor fueling the movement is the dissidents' belief
that Hill long turned a blind eye when Charles Hughes, head of the
local representing 22,000 school crossing guards and cafeteria
workers, embezzled more than $1.7 million, according to a union
judicial panel. Among the funds that the panel found he took
wrongfully were $685,000 in overtime expenses and $329,000 to pay
his family's personal credit card bills.
</P>
<P>
   The critics are also demanding that Hill take a tougher stance
toward Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. They complain that Hill betrayed his
members by accepting a contract with a two-year pay freeze in 1996
and by not battling Giuliani's workfare program over their concern
that welfare recipients in the program are doing jobs once done by
union employees.
</P>
<P>
   Hill, interviewed on Friday, played down the dissidents'
importance, saying their committee was not very large.
</P>
<P>
   Defending himself against criticisms that he has let corruption
fester, Hill has repeatedly said that he had to respect the
autonomy of the 56 locals in District Council 37, which is part of
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees. But
the district council's executive board is to vote in November on
giving Hill more power to oversee each local's finances.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are making changes,'' Hill said in the interview.
</P>
<P>
   The dissidents, who formed a committee two months ago, have more
credibility than most insurgent groups because their ranks include
the presidents of five union locals, which represent more than
12,000 workers. The group, called the Committee for Real Change at
D.C. 37, says 5,000 workers have signed petitions backing its
platform.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a tremendous chance of making real change in this
union,'' said Carl Biers, executive director of the Association for
Union Democracy, a nonprofit monitoring group based in New York.
``Their platform is right on the mark for the problems DC 37 has _
financial abuse and a structure that concentrates power in the
hands of the heads of a few big locals. I'm impressed that they've
already forced Stanley Hill to address these issues.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Committee for Real Change is demanding that the district
council's executive director be chosen through direct elections by
all members, rather than by a council of delegates that is
dominated by a handful of local presidents. In the committee's
view, one reason that Hill has not moved vigorously against the
presidents of locals suspected of corruption is that he needed
their support to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the committee wants to require all 56 locals to
have a neutral group, like the American Arbitration Association,
oversee union elections. They point to a recent election at the
local representing 7,000 city engineers. After a preliminary count
put an insurgent ahead in the race for the local's presidency,
several ballot boxes disappeared from a locked mail room controlled
by district council officials.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Albano, the local's longtime leader, denied any
wrongdoing, but a new election was ordered, and the insurgent, Roy
Commer, beat Albano by an even greater margin.
</P>
<P>
   Showing growing dissatisfaction with the council's leadership,
union members have voted out incumbents at two other locals this
year. The three incumbents who were voted out remain on the
20-member executive board and receive an $18,000 annual stipend
from the union, which leaders of the Committee for Real Change said
was undemocratic and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   In stressing the importance of financial reforms, the dissidents
point to the investigation of several locals that bought thousands
of turkeys to give to members at Thanksgiving and Christmas. Union
officials say they have told Manhattan District Attorney Robert
Morgenthau that they believe some union leaders received kickbacks
because several locals paid $44 each for turkeys that usually sell
for about $20.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenthal, the new head of the motor vehicle operators' local,
suspected kickbacks and criticized his predecessor for spending
$91,888 for a Christmas party in 1995. And members of the local
representing City University workers have asked Hill to investigate
how $192,000 disappeared from their union's treasury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Martin Luther King went to Memphis in 1968, and he died there
fighting for sanitation workers who wanted to have a union and join
the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees,''
said Tom Dawes, an organizer in the engineers' union and a leader
of the Committee for Real Change. ``I don't think Martin Luther
King went there so that 30 years later a few selfish individuals
could use the union's treasury as a personal piggy bank.''

MILLOY PICKS PERFECT MOMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Once again, just as it was last week against
the Colts, it was Lawyer Milloy's intelligence, his instincts, his
feel for a given situation that led to an interception.
</P>
<P>
   But this time, unlike the gift from Peyton Manning, the
interception saved a game.
</P>
<P>
   The highlight reels will show Steve McNair's pass coming
directly to Milloy, then Milloy will be shown racing downfield,
reaching the end zone, dancing in the end zone, sending the crowd
at Foxboro Stadium into ecstasy. His interception and return for a
touchdown with 4:07 left in a 20-16 game was the height of
defensive play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I read the quarterback's eyes,'' said Milloy, who was playing
in a zone defense after he saw the Oilers' offensive moves just
after the snap. ``And McNair threw it right to me.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair's pass was directly to Milloy _ sometimes the hardest to
catch _ but Milloy said he wasn't even thinking of dropping the
ball. ``What it was,'' he said, ``is one of those plays where it's
hard to look because you're seeing all that green in front of you.
I was thinking it would be a big turnover at that point, even
without the score.''
</P>
<P>
   But once he had the pick, the safety went on, ``from there on I
was thinking, just let your athletic ability take over ... and then
celebrate in the end zone.''
</P>
<P>
   So much more happened than what will be seen in the highlights.
As the Patriots' other safety, Willie Clay, put it, ``It was like a
chess match out there,'' offensive and defensive coordinators
trying to read the other team's tendencies _ and minds _ with blitz
packages and blitz pickup packages.
</P>
<P>
   As the Oilers lined up on their 20 with a little more than four
minutes left, Milloy was involved in his own chess match.
Afterward, the safety tried to explain what his duties were _
basically to start out in a man-to-man defense if a certain
receiver went one way but to drop into a zone if something else
happened. ``It's hard to explain,'' he said. ``It took me a whole
summer just to learn it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Milloy read perfectly what was happening in front of him,
dropped into a zone, and, as usual with the Patriots' aggressive
defense, ``we're going after the ball and we're going after
turnovers, and when you score a TD on a turnover, it's a bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   This had happened a week earlier against the Colts. Milloy and
cornerback Ty Law instantly read an Indianapolis formation, swapped
positions seamlessly, and Manning never caught on. His pass went
directly to Law.
</P>
<P>
   This time McNair didn't catch on, or his receivers fled to areas
of the field where the QB never expected, ``because you're doing
something based on seeing all those things going on in front of you
and I was following his eyes the same time,'' said Milloy. ``I was
pretty much in a zone and he pretty much threw it right to me.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair, Milloy went on, ``didn't know I was going to be there. I
was hiding inside the defense and then I just jumped out.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a fourth-quarter play, it was a game-turning play. It was
a play the Patriots' defense will have to make time and again.
Milloy ran his pick back for the first TD of his career, and later
Law would pick off another McNair pass.
</P>
<P>
   Good vibes here _ a Lawyer and Law on the same side of the
ledger. For once.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: IS THE GLOBAL CAPITALIST SYSTEM COLLAPSING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By FLOYD NORRIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last week, the world's best-known money manager, George Soros,
warned that the global capitalist system ``is coming apart at the
seams.''
</P>
<P>
   His view reflected the fear _ felt more strongly by investment
professionals than by the individual Americans who entrust their
money to the pros _ that the global financial system is under the
greatest strain it has faced in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir Mohamad, the Malaysian prime minister, imposed capital
controls to make it harder for investors to take money out of his
country, saying he acted because the ``free market has failed
disastrously.''
</P>
<P>
   Soros, a hedge fund manager previously blamed by Mahathir for
causing Asia's problems, did not sound all that different when he
testified to Congress. ``Instead of acting like a pendulum,'' he
said, ``financial markets have recently acted more like a wrecking
ball, knocking over one country after another.''
</P>
<P>
   That may be overstating it, but there is no question that
international investors have grown very worried. The Dow Jones
industrial average is down only 15 percent from the peak it reached
in July, but virtually every other market in the world has done
much worse. There is a flight of capital from emerging markets, and
from less solid companies in established markets.
</P>
<P>
   As that has happened, losses have piled up. It should surprise
no one that hedge funds such as those managed by Soros have done
poorly. They make money by using leverage _ that is, by borrowing
money _ and placing big bets. If the bets go wrong, they can lose
big.
</P>
<P>
   But there have also been large losses in established and, one
had thought, more conservatively run, financial institutions.
Hardly a day goes by that some bank or brokerage firm does not
announce it has lost another $100 million or more. The result has
been a fast-fall in the prices of financial stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses reflect the fact that derivative securities are far
more prevalent than they ever were before. There is nothing
inherently bad in such securities. They simply make it possible to
buy or sell risks _ of currency moves, or interest rate rises, or
lots of other things _ in ways not possible before.
</P>
<P>
   When Russia's government and its banks essentially defaulted on
their debts, some Western banks found that they faced big losses
that they thought they had laid off. They had, for example, entered
into trades that would compensate their customers if the ruble
plunged in value. Then they covered that bet by entering into the
opposite trade with a big Russian bank. When the ruble plunged,
they lost money in honoring the first guarantee, and could not make
up the loss through the second transaction.
</P>
<P>
   Those losses have stunned investors and reminded them that the
current accounting system does not allow them to gauge accurately
the risks being taken on with derivatives. Managements of financial
institutions have responded by being much more careful in taking
those risks. There are signs of a global credit crunch, in which
only the safest borrowers can get cash at reasonable rates.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the confidence in the ability of the
International Monetary Fund and the major Western governments to
keep things on an even keel has been shaken. The belief that they
would somehow protect imprudent investors grew after the Mexican
bailout in 1995, and contributed to the flood of money that went
into emerging markets in 1996 and 1997. Now that money is coming
out, the IMF is nearly broke, and Western governments have done
little.
</P>
<P>
   In that atmosphere, it is easy to talk of the disintegration of
the world financial system. But it may also be overdone. In a few
months, investors may become less risk averse if they see the world
has not collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   As for countries, those that most alarmed investors may be
having second thoughts. Russia, which had all but repudiated its
foreign debt, last week said it was looking for ways to treat
foreign investors better. As for Malaysia, after it was done
denouncing the global capitalist system, it hired Salomon Smith
Barney to try to float an international loan.

EDITORIAL: CLINTON'S STRANGE POWER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Monday, Sept. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The Monica Lewinsky scandal has weakened Bill Clinton's grasp on
his office, but it may have given him a peculiar new weapon in the
budget wars. Only a few weeks from adjournment, Congress is engaged
in the annual autumn ritual of confronting the White House over
taxes and spending, just when Clinton is braving the impeachment
firestorm on an island of his own contradictions. But in that
weakness lies a paradoxical kind of strength. The more feeble the
president seems, the more seriously Congress takes his demands. The
last thing they want is to distract the public from Clinton's
troubles and provoke a searching look at the GOP budget priorities.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans in the House are threatening to find money for
emergency spending on Bosnia, farm assistance and embassy security
by cutting summer jobs and home heating assistance for poor people.
Clinton says he will veto if they do. In the Senate, Republicans
want to attach 24 anti-environmental riders to the Interior
Department appropriations bill, while cutting funds to combat water
pollution and to restore the Everglades. The president says he will
veto the bill if it reaches his desk in its present form.
Republicans have provoked another veto warning by threatening to
attach a school voucher program to a District of Columbia spending
bill. Proposed amendments to other bills would undermine family
planning programs at home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   To all these threats, the White House is saying, ``Make my
day.'' It is itching for a fight on anything that will portray
Clinton as a man of principle, thereby throwing the Republicans on
the defensive. The fire breathers in the House, like David McIntosh
of Indiana, want to press an ambitious agenda on spending, tax cuts
and social issues. But calmer heads like House Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Bob Livingston, the Appropriations Committee chairman,
believe that it would be folly to allow President Clinton to
campaign on the issues and thus deflect attention from a scandal
that they believe has lifted their chances in November.
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to carve out something for the voters, Republicans in
both houses are scrambling to bridge their differences on a tax cut
of as much as $80 billion, paid for by this year's budget surplus.
Last week, the president vowed again to veto it, arguing that the
money should be set aside to rescue Social Security. The White
House worries that some Democrats will defect, which is possible
because they fear that Clinton will simply make a deal that
undercuts them and makes them look foolish. The Lewinsky scandal is
not the only reason that some Democrats doubt Clinton's constancy.
</P>
<P>
   In all this strategizing is the sad spectacle of what might have
been. No wonder the Democrats are despondent and mutinous. Earlier
this year, they had polls showing that the public was placing its
confidence in Democrats on health care, education and the economy
for the first time in years. There would be a competitive race to
control the House, and Richard Gephardt allowed himself to dream
the dream of becoming speaker.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is all gone. The public can only look with wonder on
these developments. Clinton's leverage, a zen mutation of weakness
into strength, may work this year to advance his budget goals, and
victory on these items would be good for the country. But it will
mean little if he cannot pump other kinds of authority into his
hollowed-out presidency.

OILERS' MCNAIR ONLY FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The quarterback and running back sat about 5
yards from each other in the locker room, both staring down at the
floor or glancing around the room while teammates put their best
spin on what went wrong Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Tennessee Oilers quarterback Steve McNair and running back
Eddie George will make their best attempt to look forward, to put
Sunday's fourth-quarter collapse against the Patriots behind them.
</P>
<P>
   They know they have to. They are the team's cornerstones, McNair
a 1995 first-round draft pick brought in two seasons after Warren
Moon's departure, George a 1996 first-round pick who helped give
the team a reliable ground game.
</P>
<P>
   How soon they vault themselves to the echelon of the best
running back/-quarterback tandems will depend on how well they
respond to debacles like Sunday's. One thing's for certain: Both
have had it with current events.
</P>
<P>
   ``This one hurts,'' said McNair. ``But we just have to fight
back next week. Knowing you had the lead and had a chance to win.
They didn't do anything to stop us. We stopped ourselves. They made
the big plays at the end. We gave up the big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   George agreed. ``When we're in that situation (of finishing a
game strongly), I'm pretty sure we will reflect back on this day
and say this is our chance, this is our opportunity,'' said George,
who had 100 yards on 23 carries and a touchdown catch but wasn't a
factor late in the fourth quarter, when the Oilers fell apart
offensively and defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to challenges, said George, ``is nothing you can
prepare for. I think we've worked hard. We've studied. We've done
everything possible. Right now we have to make plays for the full
60 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way you're going to be able to compete in the
playoffs and the only way you're going to get in the upper echelon
of the NFL is to make plays in crucial moments.''
</P>
<P>
   McNair completed 28 of 38 pass attempts for 202 yards and one
touchdown but also threw two interceptions after the Patriots went
ahead, 20-16. And the noted scrambler ran for only 6 yards.
</P>
<P>
   On the first interception, McNair and coach Jeff Fisher said
there was miscommunication by McNair and tight end Frank Wycheck,
who cut inside when the quarterback thought he would cut outside.
</P>
<P>
   The second pickoff was much easier to explain. ``I just made a
bad throw,'' McNair said. ``Things like that happen. I just have to
be more patient and take what they give me.''
</P>
<P>
   Like George, McNair said he felt the team didn't make the big
plays when needed. He added that he had hoped wide receiver Kevin
Dyson had been more involved. But he stopped short of agreeing with
a few Tennessee wideouts' assertion that the offense has become too
predictable because of a short-passing attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can say a lot of the things right now because we lost,''
he said. ``If we had won, we would have been glorified. We need to
look within ourselves and do the things to prepare ourselves
better. (Long patterns) are out of my control.
</P>

PLAYS WERE THING IN PATRIOTS' WINNING EFFORT 
</HEADLINE>
 COLUMN-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL McDONOUGH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe

<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ Dave Krieg had nothing to do with the
outcome, but with 19 years of service in the NFL, he knows better
than most what makes the difference in a game like the one the
Patriots played against the Tennessee Oilers Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are five plays that usually determine who wins the
game,'' said Krieg, the 39-year-old veteran quarterback who backs
up Steve McNair of the Oilers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, the Patriots made those plays. When all the big plays
came in the final minutes of the game, they made them all. We
didn't make any. Up to that point, we were making the big plays,
and that's why I thought we were going to beat them.''
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't to be for the Oilers, who self-destructed on three
critical plays in the last four minutes.
</P>
<P>
   With five minutes left, the Oilers led, 16-13, in a game that
had gone the way they wanted most of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Then bad things started to happen. The Patriots had second and 6
on their 49, when the Oilers called for a blitz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It had worked well for us all day,'' said coach Jeff Fisher.
``We rolled the safety (Marcus Robertson) up and had him blitz off
the corner. We had the cornerback on that side of the field back
off, because he didn't have any help at the post. They just hit us
with a big play. They had the right call.''
</P>
<P>
   Fisher said he didn't think the Patriots anticipated what the
Oilers were going to do. ``Earlier in the game, we ran the same
kind of defense from the opposite side, and we sacked Drew Bledsoe
on the play,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots did have the perfect call, a quick slant to Terry
Glenn running across the middle from the left side of the field. As
he was supposed to, cornerback Darryll Lewis backed off at the
snap. Safety Blaine Bishop sat in the middle of the field, and left
cornerback Denard Walker dropped deep on his side of the field. The
three defensive backs were spread across the field about 15 yards
deep. Lewis was 5 yards off Glenn, when Glenn caught the ball in
stride and took off across the field, left-to-right, then cut down
the right sideline and headed for the end zone and a 20-16 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``They caught us in the right defense,'' said Bishop, one of the
best safeties in the league, ``but we still should have kept him
out of the end zone. He's got great speed, and he ran past us. If
we make the tackle and hold them to a field goal, it's still tied,
and we come down the field at the end of the game with a chance to
win. But they made the play, and we didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   That was the theme in the Tennessee locker room after the game.
``The difference between their team and ours is they make big plays
when it counts, our team has yet to do that. If we want to win, we
have to find some guys who are going to step up and make big
plays.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots weren't finished with their big-play dominance at
the end. When the Oilers got the ball back, trailing by 4 with
plenty of time to play, McNair and his recievers made two poor
plays that resulted in New England interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyer Milloy grabbed the first one and returned it 30 yards for
a touchdown to put the game away, 27-16, and Ty Law added another
interception with less than two minutes to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``On both of those plays there was a miscommunication between
the passer and the receiver,'' said Oilers offensive coordinator
Les Steckel. ``Steve thought that Frank Wycheck was going outside
and he went inside. Same way on the next one (to Yancey Thigpen).''
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen was especially frustrated at the loss. ``We had a plan
on offense all day and we stuck with it until we got behind,'' he
said. ``Then we started to do other things and they didn't work. I
don't know why.''
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense won this game. The Tennessee defense's
blitz package had stymied Bledsoe and his offensive teammates
almost the entire game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we had him off balance,'' said Bishop. ``We came after
him hard in the second quarter and hit him a lot. We wanted to get
him in third-and-long situations with pressure, and then drop into
a zone, make him throw underneath, and then make the tackle (short
of the first down).''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what we did until the end,'' said Fisher. ``Then they
made the plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston gambles on defense because its line is not that good.
The Oilers do not have a legitimate pass rusher either on the line
or at linebacker. So they have to use their defensive backs to
chase the quarterback. When they do, they leave themselves
vulnerable somewhere in the secondary. Bledsoe could not find that
``somewhere'' until late in the game with Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots could not run the ball. At the end of three
quarters they had just 196 yards of total offense. They wound up
with 322, thanks to Glenn's 51-yard reception and a late 53-yard
burst off tackle by Robert Edwards after the Oilers already had
cashed it in.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots' defense controlled McNair and kept him in the
pocket until he blew up near the end.
</P>
<P>
   McNair entered the fourth period nearly perfect, with 19
completions in 24 attempts and no interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``At that point Steve had thrown 98 passes in a row without an
inteception,'' said Fisher. ``But those things happen.'' McNair had
two in his next 10 throws.
</P>
<P>
   Those things will continue to happen to the Oilers until they
find a way to make big plays when the game is on the line.

COMMENTARY: IN THIS RACE, IT'S L-WORDS ON BOTH SIDES 
</HEADLINE>

 ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Many races begin with policy debate and end with
name-calling. In this one, the candidates have apparently decided
to skip the preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
   Within hours of Rep. Charles Schumer's primary victory on
Tuesday, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato was already on the air with an ad
accusing him of the usual leftist vices: raising taxes, pampering
criminals, perpetuating welfare. The ad invokes the dreaded L-word
not just once but twice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chuck Schumer's a New York City liberal,'' the narrator
intones at the start. ``Liberal Chuck Schumer,'' he says again at
the end.
</P>
<P>
   As if anticipating the attack (which is, after all, basically
the same attack D'Amato used six years ago), Schumer quickly hit
back with an L-word of his own. In a pair of television ads, he
insists it is really D'Amato who is to be blamed for higher taxes
and for mollycoddling criminals. Both ads conclude with the same
catchy formula: ``D'Amato _ too many lies for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   Schumer and D'Amato are nothing if not knowing about the rules
of the game. They understand as well as anyone in politics how to
play, and how little room there is for fastidiousness. And so while
the Senate race may have gotten ugly early, it would be naive to
suppose that things have somehow got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy of both candidates in this contest is clearly to
make it a referendum on the other: D'Amato wants, more than
anything else, a race about Schumer. Schumer, meanwhile, wants one
about D'Amato. And it is quite likely that the winner of this
meta-contest will be the guy with the nastiest ads, the kind voters
tend to remember and the press loves to cover.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats have long comforted themselves with the idea that they
could beat D'Amato if they could just get a clean shot at him.
Always in the past, there has been some extenuating circumstance
for them to complain about _ and take comfort in: a three-way race
in 1980, a hopelessly underfinanced candidate in 1986, an
internecine primary in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Schumer is among those who insist that D'Amato has never
really been tested. He likes to say the senator has never met a
candidate quite like Chuck Schumer, meaning that he has always had
weaker opposition than he deserved.
</P>
<P>
   He might just as well have said that Al D'Amato has never met a
candidate quite so much like Al D'Amato.
</P>
<P>
   Like the senator, Schumer is a prodigious fund-raiser who
suffers no romantic illusions about campaigning without cash. Like
D'Amato, he is no pretty face and knows not to rely on a telegenic
smile. And like him, he is an attention hound who likes to claim
credit for achievements early and often. Schumer has watched
D'Amato defeat three Democrats in a row in a nominally Democratic
state, and he has clearly learned from the master.
</P>
<P>
   Even his television commercial accusing D'Amato of fabrication
is, obliquely at least, an homage to the senator's talent. Its tag
line, ``too many lies for too long,'' slyly echoes an ad created by
the senator's media consultants in 1994 for George Pataki, then a
gubernatorial candidate: ``Mario Cuomo _ too liberal for too
long.''
</P>
<P>
   With the original ad, D'Amato and Pataki were obviously trying
to emphasize Cuomo's 12-year tenure, and they successfully framed
that contest as a referendum on whether the governor deserved
another term.
</P>
<P>
   In this year's Senate contest, Schumer SHOULD enjoy the same
challenger's advantage. D'Amato has held office for nearly 18
years, and a logical question is, how well has he performed in it?
</P>
<P>
   But D'Amato has more experience and, arguably, more God-given
talent to draw upon. In all of his Senate races, he has shown a
rare genius for deflecting attention away from himself and focusing
on his opponents' foibles instead. Who, for example, could not help
but admire his maudlin performance of 1992, when he managed to cast
his fumbling rival, Robert Abrams, as a mean-spirited,
hate-mongering bully?
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, D'Amato was once more theatrically aggrieved,
voicing his sorrow, dismay and deep personal hurt at the nasty tone
of Schumer's ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is unfortunate that he has gotten into the
character assassination by the use of the pejoratives and the very
personal,'' he said, once again making his opponent's conduct the
issue.

CULLORS CATCH PART OF SUCCESSFUL FORMULA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ There can be no big plays without ``little''
plays. There can be no 51-yard TD passes to Terry Glenn, perhaps,
without that 8-yard blind pass from Drew Bledsoe to Derrick
Cullors. It's all part of what coach Pete Carroll calls the
``formula.''
</P>
<P>
   Rewind the highlight tape from that short pass from Bledsoe to
Glenn that turned out so long and so large. Go all the way back to
the second drive of the third quarter, back to when the Patriots'
offense was struggling and in a stupor, back to when Tennessee just
had taken a 13-6 lead, back to when prospects seemed so grim.
</P>
<P>
   It was third and 4 at the Patriot 29 midway through the third
quarter. Bledsoe dropped back to pass, the Oilers once again had
coverage, and it seemed the play _ yet another New England
offensive play _ would go for naught. Bledsoe looked upfield and,
once again, saw nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm in there on third down and I want to make big plays,''
Cullors would say. ``That's what a third-down back has to do _ make
big plays.''
</P>
<P>
   So Cullors, seeing that Bledsoe was in distress, did the only
thing he could do _ he shouted as loud as he could, ``Drew! Drew!''
Said Cullors, ``I wanted Drew to know that I was out there.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as Bledsoe would say later, ``Believe it or not, even with
70,000 people out there, I heard him ... and I felt I could chuck
it out to him.''
</P>
<P>
   What followed was what Bledsoe would call a ``Meggett-esque
play,'' Cullors catching the short pass in the left flat,
sidestepping a tackler who was sure to bring him down short of the
first down and somehow scooting free for 8 yards and the first
down. ``One of the big plays in the game,'' said Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   But if Cullors had performed a Meggett-esque play, then Bledsoe
had performed a ... what? A Favre-esque play? A Flutie-esque play?
That's because Cullors would say, ``I don't think Drew ever saw me.
He heard me and he threw it to where he thought I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Bledsoe would concede he threw the ball in the direction of the
``Drew! Drew!'' shouts, even though the QB also would admit, ``I
saw him out of the corner of my eye.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bledsoe also said, ``It was a dangerous kind of pass, but it
was a gamble I thought I could take because nobody was out there
with him.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a play that had to be made if New England was to get back
in the game. And all knew it because, as Cullors said, ``players
and coaches came up to me on the bench and said how big it was,''
how it awoke the offense, how it got things going.
</P>
<P>
   All part of the ``formula.'' The foundation of the formula
``that we've got going for us,'' said Carroll, is that bedrock
defense that should keep New England in most games. That strong
defense leads to the next part of the formula, an offense that does
not turn the ball over.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled,'' said Carroll of his offense having not turned
the ball over once this season. ``We've got three games where
they're not taking the ball away from us.''
</P>
<P>
   Now add to the formula the steady hand of Bledsoe, a liberal
pinch of Glenn making game-breaking catches, and finally a dash of
two of the other players making big plays.
</P>
<P>
   So fast-forward the highlight tape to later in that drive that
Cullors kept alive with the Meggett-esque catch and run. New
England had the ball with a first and goal from the Tennessee 9,
and Robert Edwards was called to run off left guard. The rookie
gained a measly 2 yards, and he pounded his fist in anger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad that one guy was able to bring me down,'' said
Edwards. ``The offensive line had done their job and I had one guy
to beat and he brought me down.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, on second down, the Patriots surprised everybody, including
Edwards. ``We'd been passing the ball downfield,'' he said, ``and
maybe the Oilers thought we'd be passing again.''
</P>
<P>
   But the play called for Edwards to run, and the rookie showed
some of the moves that made the Patriots feel he was worth their
first draft choice, exploding into a large hole and then making a
nifty 360-degree turn near the goal line to escape the final
tackler.
</P>
<P>
   All part of the formula, just as was the fourth quarter _ the
pass by Bledsoe, the catch-and-run by Glenn, the interceptions by
Lawyer Milloy and Ty Law, the strong defense, etc.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a formula going for us,'' Carroll said more than
once. It's a formula that all New England football fans can grasp.

THIGPEN SHORT OF PATIENCE WITH OILER PASSING SCHEME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ As a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers,
Yancey Thigpen was one of the best deep-threat wide receivers in
the National Football League. Three games into his Tennessee Oilers
career, the All-Pro is wondering why his enormous talents aren't
being put to use.
</P>
<P>
   ``I go from averaging 18 yards a catch to 8 yards a catch?''
said Thigpen, who had three catches for 21 yards against the
Patriots Sunday, the longest a 9-yarder. He now has 12 catches for
159 yards, an average of 13.3 yards a catch. That would be adequate
for some wideouts; for Thigpen, it's unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it me? Have I lost something?'' he asked reporters after
his team's 27-16 loss. ``No, it's just that if you catch a ball on
a stationary route, you're not going to do very much with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on a team which didn't pass the ball very much, but when
we did pass the ball it was very effective and it was down the
field,'' added Thigpen, who scoffed at the notion that the Patriots
defense kept him from being a factor.
</P>
<P>
   In a locker room where many of the Oilers vented frustations,
furious over having blown an opportunity to win, Thigpen was the
most vocal. He questioned the team's short-pass play calling,
adding that it made the Oilers' offense most predictable and
eventually hampered the running game.
</P>
<P>
   The statistics bolster Thigpen's claim: Quarterback Steve McNair
completed 28 of 38 passes for 202 yards, but his two longest passes
were a 27-yard shotgun throw to running back Eddie George and a
22-yard screen pass to George. McNair's longest completion to a
wideout was a 10-yarder to Willie Davis.
</P>
<P>
   Credit also the coverage of cornerback Ty Law, who did a solid
job against Thigpen. ``That's what I get paid for,'' said Law, who
was burned on a late-game fourth-down reception by Thigpen last
season when the latter helped the Steelers shock the Patriots.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had his passes, but I thought we contained him,''
said Law.
</P>
<P>
   But when a reporter suggested that the Patriots took him out of
the game, Thigpen became irate. ``Who took me out of the game?
Nobody took me out of the game,'' he fired back. ``If you get a guy
for 5 yards, he's still in the core of everything, all the
defensive backs are still behind him. You hit a guy downfield and
it's him and couple of defensive backs. Now you have more of a
chance to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Thigpen said McNair has been able to get the ball to the
receivers but the team's patterns are too short.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're just going 2 yards out, 3 yards out because we don't
have the patience to go downfield and defensive backs are just
backing off,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now no one in the National Football League, for any
reason whatsoever, should respect our passing game until we start
throwing the ball downfield.''

BC'S CLOUD ANSWERS CHALLENGES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In the first three games of the 1998 season, Boston
College has responded well to times of adversity.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as BC begins preparations for a nonconference matchup
Saturday at Louisville, the Eagles _ especially senior running back
Mike Cloud _ will have to deal with more adversity after BC coach
Tom O'Brien placed Cloud's backup, Quinton Lee, on indefinite
suspension Sunday for violating team rules. Lee, a junior running
back from Houston, was arrested by Boston police at an off-campus
party early Sunday morning and charged with assault and battery on
an officer and disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Lee's indefinite absence will place an added burden on Cloud and
sophomore Cedric Washington of Holyoke, who moves from No. 3 to No.
2 on the depth chart, as they try to keep BC's running game
operating smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   In another roster move, redshirt freshman offensive lineman John
Richardson will move up to backup right guard after Butch Palaza of
Quincy injured his left knee against Temple.
</P>
<P>
   When the Eagles faced adversity in each of their first three
games, Cloud responded.
</P>
<P>
   In a season-opening 41-31 victory at Georgia Tech, the Yellow
Jackets cut BC's 17-7 lead to 3 with just seconds left before
halftime, but Cloud helped BC maintain control by rushing 34 times
for 200 yards and a pair of touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, in the third quarter of a 41-14 BC romp, Rutgers'
Reggie Stephens scored on a 28-yard interception return that cut
the Eagles' lead to 20-14. But Cloud answered with a 6-yard TD that
capped a seven-play, 80-yard drive on which he accounted for 73
yards.
</P>
<P>
   In Saturday's 31-7 victory over Temple, Cloud rushed 27 times
for 196 yards and scored three touchdowns, including a dazzling
85-yarder, to help the Eagles score 31 consecutive points after
spotting the Owls an early 7-0 lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``After three games now, I think we're starting to come together
a little bit,'' BC quarterback Scott Mutryn said. ``In the Georgia
Tech game maybe we got a little spoiled, because we played a very
perfect game and we didn't have any turnovers or penalties. Now,
the last two weeks we've gone through a little adversity and we've
responded well to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've said it before, but this team has a lot of character on
it as well as many characters. I think it's really shown the last
couple of weeks, because when the challenge came, guys on this team
stepped up and met that challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the challenge of preserving their perfect record
against Louisville, which scored a 35-9 victory at Illinois
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're going to present us with a different challenge,'' said
junior defensive tackle Mike Willetts, who played a significant
role in holding Temple's rushing attack, which entered the game
rated No. 4 in the nation, to 151 yards (297 total offense) with
five solo tackles, a fumble recovery, and a quarterback pressure.
``We've worked all (last) week on stopping the run and (this) week
it's a pass-oriented team, so we're going to have to be able to
change gears really quickly come Tuesday. It's definitely going to
be a challenge, but we just have to work hard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Still, it gives us great confidence knowing that we're 3-0 and
it's a game that we should win.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, BC continued its ascent toward the Top 25 in the polls,
garnering 37 votes in the USA Today/ESPN coaches poll and 31 in the
Associated Press Top 25.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a lot of the previews, a lot of people didn't think we were
going to be a talented team or able to win a lot of games,'' said
senior wideout Anthony DiCosmo, ``but I think we're slowly but
surely proving people wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Mutryn, ``We just have to continue getting better and not
worrying about what the polls say. If we keep winning, then in the
end the polls are going to reflect that. We can't get caught up
with that. We have to let our play on the field determine how good
a team we are.''

DARK DAY IN SUNSHINE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Forgive the fans of the Florida and Miami football
programs if there weren't a lot of sunny faces in the Sunshine
State Sunday morning. The Gators and the Hurricanes went down to
heartbreaking overtime defeats Saturday night, coincidentally
almost simultaneously on national television.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that last week's loss by Florida State to North Carolina
State and you have the rare occurrence of all three marquee
programs in the state being relegated to the second tier of the
national championship race before the end of September.
</P>
<P>
   You knew it had to happen to Florida. The Gators went into
Knoxville with five straight wins over the Vols and no Peyton
Manning to worry about.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened? The Gators self-destructed with turnovers,
penalties, and ultimately a missed 32-yard field goal attempt by
Collins Cooper, which assured Tennessee of a 20-17 triumph.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what monkey everybody's been talking about, but
I'm glad it's off my back,'' said Tennessee coach Phil Fulmer.
</P>
<P>
   Florida clearly is struggling to find an identity, especially at
quarterback, where coach Steve Spurrier continues to alternate
Jesse Palmer and Doug Johnson on every play.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the penalties that have come with this shuttle
system, the Gators have also turned the ball over _ a lot. They
coughed it up three times in the first half Saturday night, which
meant Florida has lost nine fumbles in three games.
</P>
<P>
   Turnovers weren't the sole province of the Gators. Matching the
frustration level of Spurrier and the Gators was Miami coach Butch
Davis, who watched his team turn the ball over on five consecutive
series from late in the second quarter to early in the fourth in
the Hurricanes' 27-20 loss to Virginia Tech.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Colorado remains unbeaten but continues to have problems with
penalties _ an ongoing problem for the Buffaloes under coach  &UR; Rick
Neuheisel &LR; . In Saturday's 25-6 win over Utah State, Colorado picked
up 11 penalties for 94 yards. Utah State was even worse, with 15
penalties for 118 yards ... Somebody should check the water supply
in the state of Kansas. A week ago Kansas State scored a record 59
points in the first half en route to a 73-7 romp over Northern
Illinois. Saturday, Kansas tied a school record by piling up a
49-14 halftime lead en route to a 63-14 win over Illinois State ...
Iowa State's 38-0 win over Ball State was the Cyclones' first
shutout in 14 years ... Brigham Young lost at Washington, 20-10,
but that wasn't nearly the worst part of the Cougars' weekend. En
route to Seattle Friday, the Cougars' chartered jet had to dive to
avoid collision with a military jet flying near Boise, Idaho. ``I
know how close cars can be, but this is the closest I've ever seen
two planes,'' said defensive tackle  &UR; Daren Yancey &LR; . The pilot of
the charter told the team that a cockpit radar alarm ordered the
jet to dive 500 feet to avoid collision with an A-10 Warthog.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Missouri continues to be frustrated in its quest to beat a No. 1
team. The Tigers, who led, 14-13, over No. 1 Ohio State at
halftime, were bombed by the Buckeyes in the second half en route
to a 35-14 loss. Mizzou is now 0-8 against No. 1 teams and has not
beaten a Top 10 team in 17 years ... Florida State, which had
scored only 30 points in its first two games, took out its
frustrations by pounding Duke, 62-13 ... All of you smart guys out
there who took Rutgers and the 44 points from Syracuse, you lost.
Syracuse won by 56, which proves the Orangemen are back on pace to
make a run at an Alliance Bowl slot, and also proves that Rutgers
might be the worst team in Division 1-A football. It's the most
points Rutgers has given up since 1888. The Knights have been
outscored by Syracuse in the last three years, 162-17 ... Final
score: Army 37, Cincinnati 20. What's the big deal, you say?
Nothing, unless you are an Army fan and realized it was the Cadets'
first conference game in its 109-year history. Who says Conference
USA doesn't have any sense of tradition? ... If you are looking for
a team to come from off the pace in the national race, take a look
at Georgia. The Bulldogs are 3-0 against marginal competition,
including a 16-9 win over Wyoming Saturday. Georgia's defense is
winning the games. In three weeks, Georgia has allowed only 13
points, its lowest three-game total since 1954. If you want a
long-shot Heisman Trophy candidate, try  &UR; Champ Bailey &LR; , &UR;  &LR; who is
playing defensive back and wide receiver for the Bulldogs, and
doing both very well.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   So much for Central Florida's 15 minutes of fame. The Golden
Knights finally had the national spotlight they wanted when they
faced Purdue in an ESPN contest Saturday. But it was an opportunity
squandered in a 35-7 loss. ``I don't know how the nation will view
us,'' said coach  &UR; Mike Kruczek &LR; . ``But we're mad at ourselves.''
... Texas, which has been routed by UCLA and Kansas the last two
weeks, is having first-half problems. The Longhorns were outscored
in the first half, 70-3, in the two games ... In a strange way,
Louisville's victory over Illinois was good news for Boston College
fans. The win snapped a 10-game losing streak for Louisville, which
not only takes some pressure off the Cardinals but gives BC coach
 &UR; Tom O'Brien  &LR; a nice tool to motivate his team for next week's game
at Louisville. Facing the Cardinals with a 1-2 record is better
than facing them at 0-3 in terms of the Eagles being overconfident.

BC SUSPENDS LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Junior running back Quinton Lee was suspended
indefinitely from Boston College's football team after he was
arrested by Boston police early Sunday morning at an off-campus
party and charged with assault and battery on an officer and
disorderly conduct.
</P>
<P>
   According to police reports, Lee, 22, of Houston, was spotted by
officers holding a plastic cup of beer at 12:30 a.m. at a party at
10 Sutherland Road near Cleveland Circle. Lee was approached by a
Boston police officer and told to empty the contents of the cup
into a sewer drain. But, according to police sources, Lee refused
and instead finished his drink and defiantly threw the cup on the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   Lee reportedly argued with the police officer, resisted arrest,
and was jailed overnight at District 14 before he was released
Sunday. He will be arraigned in Brighton District Court Monday.
</P>
<P>
   BC coach Tom O'Brien said Sunday Lee was suspended indefinitely
for violation of team rules and offered no further comment.
</P>
<P>
   According to BC spokesman Reid Oslin, Lee could be subject to
further disciplinary action by Bob Sherwood, BC's dean of student
development. However, Oslin declined to speculate on what action
could be taken, citing Lee's pending arraignment.

REVOLUTION ON COURSE FOR 1999 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The Revolution will have many regrets this
season. They have earned 9 points in the last 19 days, shut out
their last three opponents, and converted themselves into one of
the hottest teams in Major League Soccer.
</P>
<P>
   But, since the Revolution earned just 20 points during the first
five months of the season, they failed to make the playoffs and
their recent wins have been rendered superfluous.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it is significant that the team has regained credibility
with Walter Zenga as coach and that fan support has remained
strong.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we have established hope for the future, even though
the season has been taken away from us,'' general manager Brian
O'Donovan said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution's 3-0 victory over Tampa Bay Saturday night was
their third successive shutout victory. Though the Revolution have
had little success on the field, and mostly failed to establish a
credible or effective style of play, they appear to have
established themselves on the sporting scene, averaging 18,813 in
home attendance at Foxboro Stadium. A 20,000-plus crowd is expected
for the final home match, against the MetroStars Saturday, and
Zenga called it a kickoff match for the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution rallied too late in the season, and remain 6
points behind fourth-place Miami with two games remaining. They are
victims of a unique MLS tie-breaking rule in which the first
determining factor is head-to-head competition. In most leagues,
goal difference takes precedent, and the Revolution (minus-12) have
an eight-goal edge over Miami (minus-20).
</P>
<P>
   Miami has won three of four games against the Revolution, and
those matches were indicative of the Revolution's failings, since
they surrendered the deciding goal in those games in the 63d (while
playing with a man advantage), the 79th, and 86th minutes,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   They seldom dictated the tempo of the game, lack of speed was
exposed, and their tactics failed at crucial times. Zenga, who
replaced Thomas Rongen Aug. 24, has revived the team and covered up
the vulnerabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Had the Revolution changed coaches sooner, things might have
been different.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what I know now, I would have made a bet on the
Kentucky Derby and I would have sold my stocks at the right time,''
O'Donovan said. ``I'm not abrogating responsibility. We would have
done things differently, and Thomas would have done things
differently.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing to think we might have been in the
playoffs. We would have given D.C. United a run for their money
because we are a team with momentum.''
</P>
<P>
   Zenga hopes to extend that momentum, and the Revolution plan to
continue training, along with invited prospects, even after the
season ends. Zenga talked of constructing ``a big team'' for next
year and is considering returning as player-coach. There have been
rumors from England that Italian striker GianFranco Zola of Chelsea
is interested in joining Zenga, but that seems a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are eager to have Walter back but it is premature to think
along those lines,'' O'Donovan said. ``Everyone has worked very
hard this year, and we have little to show for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Walter has to make a decision on all players, some very tough
decisions on salaries and who the foreigners will be. We knew
Walter was a leader on the field last year with a significant
personality, and his personality became the team's personality. We
had a hunch he could bring that back for us.''

USC HAS A LOT OF WORK TO DO
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ USC linebacker David Gibson suffered a mild
concussion in the fourth quarter against Oregon State, and had to
sit out the game's final five minutes when he couldn't remember the
defensive calls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got dinged,'' Gibson said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, if USC could figure out what everybody else's problem was
Saturday night, it might have a better idea of where it stands
heading into the biggest game of the season thus far against
Florida State.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a lot to work on before we can expect to go to
Tallahassee and beat somebody,'' wide receiver Billy Miller said.
``I think (this game) shocked us. I can't believe it when I think
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   USC should forget as quickly as possible its 40-20 victory over
the Beavers, especially when the Trojans' final 17 points came in
the game's last 2:11.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they need to focus on some other numbers. The Trojans
had 102 yards in penalties, and surpassed 100 yards in that
department for the second straight game. The way coach Paul Hackett
pays attention to detail, it's almost stunning that USC can be so
sloppy when it comes to penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Want another number? How about 4 for 17 on third-down
conversions? If that's the best the offense can muster against
Oregon State, what will the third-down conversion rate be against
Florida State?
</P>
<P>
   Did we mention that Florida State has won 35 straight home
games?
</P>
<P>
   At least USC won't be battling complacency against the
Seminoles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny. We got an early score and everyone kind of went to
sleep,'' quarterback Mike Van Raaphorst said. ``It's like we
thought, `Hey, this might be easier than I thought it would be.' ''
</P>
<P>
   It's not hard for USC (3-0) to think it could pummel the
Beavers, even though second-year coach Mike Riley has worked
wonders in Corvallis. The Trojans have won 25 straight over the
hapless Beavers.
</P>
<P>
   But this victory should accompanied by a thank-you note to
Riley, for exposing some troubling signs for USC.
</P>
<P>
   The offensive line had difficulty protecting the quarterbacks,
and dealing with Oregon State's stunting along the defensive front.
And the Trojans' passing game often seemed little more than heaving
the ball downfield to R. Jay Soward.
</P>
<P>
   The defense also showed some vulnerability, although Oregon
State lacked the weapons to fully test the Trojans.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we play like that again, we're not going to win too many
games,'' offensive lineman Travis Claridge said.
</P>
<P>
   At least the quarterback situation seems to have settled down
with Van Raaphorst clearly No. 1, in another
solid-but-not-spectacular performance.
</P>
<P>
   But reserve quarterback Carson Palmer's 1 for 7 effort against
Oregon State shouldn't be totally blamed on the freshman. USC seems
intent on having Palmer provide some magic, a la Purdue, whenever
he makes an appearance and almost seems to force throwing the ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Oregon State game served another purpose, aside from
illustrating USC's weaknesses. It kept the Trojans, who are ranked
18th in the Associated Press poll, from becoming the slightest
overconfident heading into this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It might have been worse for us if we had come in and blown
them out,'' Miller said. ``It brought us down to earth.''
</P>
<P>
   That's a week earlier than everyone expected it to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: Although linebacker David Gibson technically suffered a
mild concussion, he is OK and can play this week. How serious is
USC viewing the Florida State game? Three potential starters _
linebacker Mark Cusano, strong safety Grant Pearsall and defensive
end Lawrence Larry _ sat out the Oregon State contest to increase
their chances of being healthy this week.
</P>
<P>
   Cusano (sprained ankle) said he will definitely practice this
week and play against the Seminoles.

UCLA'S RATING TOO HIGH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Another win, a new week and a different perspective on the
Bruins, thanks to their sloppy play at Houston and Kansas State's
48-7 thrashing of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe UCLA's season-opener wasn't that impressive after all.
Perhaps its No. 4 ranking is too lofty for a team with just six
senior starters. Perhaps the Fiesta Bowl is unrealistic for a team
with its best defensive lineman on crutches and its best playmaker
in a hospital bed.
</P>
<P>
   Three things are certain: that UCLA is capable of shifting into
high and pummelling foes on its road to the Pac-10 title; that the
Bruins must compensate for Freddie Mitchell's broken leg; and that
they must secure a defensive line temporarily weakened by Kenyon
Coleman's strained knee.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins have three irreplaceable players: quarterback Cade
McNown, kicker Chris Sailer and safety Larry Atkins, whose value to
the defense far exceed his modest statistics.
</P>
<P>
   On the next tier _ invaluable, but not irreplaceable _ stand
offensive tackle Kris Farris, cornerback Marques Anderson and
Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Among a veteran receiving corps, Mitchell's skills were unique.
He was the speed and swagger lacking in the mild-mannered Brad
Melsby, Danny Farmer and Brian Poli-Dixon. He could catch, run and
throw. He was UCLA's No. 1 punt and kick returner, and in his brief
freshman season he accounted for 43.2 percent of UCLA's total yards
(314 of 726).
</P>
<P>
   His absence seemingly reduces the Bruins' offense from a V-8 to
a V-6. Elimimate his playmaking, and you eliminate an entire
dimension. The field shortens. Defenses attack rather than play on
their heels.
</P>
<P>
   ``What can we do? We've got receivers who can pick up the slack,
but I don't know if they give us Freddie's big-play dimension,''
said offensive coordinator Al Borges, who, along with coach Bob
Toledo, must now tweak the offense to account for Mitchell's
absence. Watch for more passes to the tight ends, more passes to
the fullbacks _ the Bruins probably will counter with diversity.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's injury (sprained medial collateral ligament, right
knee) forced the Bruins to use true freshman Anthony Fletcher, who
they hoped to redshirt. Although Coleman is not an impact player of
Atkins' class, he's the most talented of UCLA's returning linemen.
Without him, the nine-man line rotation consists of five freshmen
and sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   If these guys were any younger, they'd interrupt practice for a
cookie break.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget: defensive line is arguably the most important
position, and elite defensive linemen are the most coveted
commodity in football, pro or college. The Bruins waited decades
for a player of Coleman's size and strength. Now they must wait for
his return.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenyon is a big part of what we do,'' defensive coordinator
Nick Aliotti said. ``It's tough to lose anybody of that caliber.
Someone else will now have to step up and play for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman is expected to return in 3-4 weeks, and no doubt UCLA
has circled Oct. 10 _ at Arizona _ on his revovery calendar. The
Bruins haven't won in Tucson since Troy Aikman roamed the field.
Each visit, they are beaten and beaten up. Coleman was supposed to
be an antidote for Arizona's physical style. Without him, UCLA's
task is hellacious.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, if you combine the sloppiness at Houston with injuries
and inexperience, every game seems ominous, starting Saturday in
Miami.

NELSON MANDELA OFFERS PRAISE FOR A CLERGYMAN AND A CATHEDRAL 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Boys Choir of Harlem sang in Xhosa Sunday.
``Bayethe Mandela,'' they shouted, in a rousing rendition of the
South African anti-apartheid anthem. ``Hail Mandela. Warrior of
Warriors. King of Kings.''
</P>
<P>
   In the front row at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine sat
Nelson Mandela and his wife, Graca Machel, their faces all smiles.
Together, to the cries of ``Amandla,'' they raised their fists in
salute.
</P>
<P>
   In what was probably his last visit to the United States as the
president of South Africa, Mandela, 79, came to the cathedral
Sunday to pay homage to Archbishop Trevor Huddleston, an Anglican
monk who became president of the Anti-Apartheid Movement and died
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela described Huddleston, a white Englishman who was posted
in South Africa shortly after he took his vows in 1939, as a man
who ``embraced the downtrodden'' and rejected the privileges that
apartheid afforded him, often at great risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was one of those rare people, good men and women who make
the world the theater of their operation in pursuit of freedom and
justice,'' Mandela said.
</P>
<P>
   It was Mandela's first visit to the cathedral, which became
known for its opposition to apartheid. On Sunday, he offered his
appreciation. ``It was important that during our last official
visit to your country before retiring from office next year,'' he
said, ``we should spend time with those Americans who have been so
closely linked with the struggle for freedom and justice in South
Africa. Our victory in defeating apartheid was your victory, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Mandela's appearance at the cathedral was part of a weeklong
visit to the United States. On Monday, he is scheduled to address
the U.N. General Assembly.

HEROIN USE SEEN DROPPING AMONG YOUNG OFFENDERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Conn., Ill., N.Y. )  (js) 
 By CHRISTOPHER S. WREN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW HAVEN _ Heroin use and the injection of drugs have declined
sharply among young people who were arrested in Manhattan and some
other urban centers, according to a survey of their drug habits.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by Dr. Bruce Johnson and Dr. Andrew Golub,
sociological researchers who chart the drug culture of New York
City's streets, was presented over the weekend at a conference of
policy specialists, historians and medical experts, who gathered at
Yale University to review the notorious rise of heroin since it was
introduced to the world 100 years ago as a cough syrup.
</P>
<P>
   The finding that more young offenders, who tend to be black or
Hispanic and poor, were shunning heroin surprised some conference
participants, because it conflicts with reports that heroin is
increasingly popular nationwide among young users who consider it
glamorous.
</P>
<P>
   But Johnson, who directs a unit of the nonprofit National
Development and Research Institutes in Manhattan, warned against
comparing his survey with more sweeping studies like the federal
government's annual National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. The
two surveys use different methods and analyze different populations
of drug users. They also vary in measuring the patterns and extent
of drug use.
</P>
<P>
   The latest federal survey released in August estimated that
171,000 Americans tried heroin for the first time in 1996, compared
with 141,000 new users in 1995. They have also grown younger, the
study found, with 90 percent of new initiates to heroin not yet 26
years old.
</P>
<P>
   One hypothesis advanced by Johnson and several other experts is
that young people growing up in impoverished neighborhoods may be
choosing not to inject or smoke heroin because they have seen too
many relatives and older friends become addicted and contract the
AIDS virus after shooting up.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have had a hard enough experience that they do not want
to get involved with heroin,'' Johnson said; ``they do not want to
get involved with injection, they do not want to get AIDS.'' But he
added, ``I can't say anything about heroin use by people outside
that pool of arrestees.''
</P>
<P>
   With no such personal experience, more affluent adolescents are
tempted to try heroin because its greater availability and purity
make it easy to snort or smoke. The heroin chic portrayed in films,
rock music and fashion also entices younger users, said Jill
Jonnes, the author of ``Hep Cats, Narcs and Pipe Dreams,'' an
American history of illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Nurco, a research professor at the University of
Maryland Medical School, said that 40 percent of heroin users had
never been arrested, and that it took an average of five years from
the onset of addiction until the first arrest.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The survey by Golub and Johnson relied on the findings of the
Arrestee Drug Abuse Monitoring Program, better known by its acronym
ADAM, which monitors illicit drug use by offenders arrested in 23
urban areas across the country.
</P>
<P>
   The program, which was previously called Drug Use Forecasting,
is run by the National Institute of Justice, a research arm of the
Justice Department. It collected data from 13,000 arrestees booked
for criminal offenses in Manhattan from 1987 to 1997, using
interviews and urine tests to verify their drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Golub studied so-called ``birth cohorts'' of
inner-city residents who share attitudes that set them apart them
from other generations of drug users. Among Manhattan arrestees
born in 1949, 52 percent reported injecting drugs, mainly heroin,
compared with 15 percent of those born in 1965 and only 1 percent
of those born in 1977. But 62 percent of the arrestees born in 1977
tested positive for marijuana, compared with 12 percent of those
born in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said his findings in Manhattan could change when the
Justice Department expands its program to include New York City's
four other boroughs. Heroin use by suspected offenders has also
declined noticeably in Chicago, Los Angeles and Washington, among
other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David Musto, the child psychiatrist and heroin expert at
Yale Medical School who organized the conference, told the
participants, ``Our nation's involvement with heroin over the past
century teaches us not to underestimate its attraction.''

 IMMIGRANTS SETTLE LAWSUIT OVER JAIL BEATINGS FOR $1.5 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   More than three years after a group of immigrants seeking
political asylum in the United States were beaten and tortured by
guards at a jail in Elizabeth, N.J., county officials there have
agreed to pay $1.5 million to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit
brought by 21 of the immigrants, lawyers said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement, first reported on Saturday in The Star-Ledger of
Newark, follows the criminal convictions in March of two guards and
a union official at the jail in the case.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, John Murphy, of Cherry Hill, N.J., a lawyer for 13 of
the former detainees, said the settlement avoided a long and costly
trial. The lawsuit, filed against Union County and 15 guards in
February 1996, sought unspecified compensatory and punitive
damages.
</P>
<P>
   The settlement caps a long and difficult journey for many of the
immigrants, who came to this country seeking asylum and were held
at a federal detention center run by a private corporation, Esmor.
They were transferred to the Union County jail in Elizabeth in June
1995 after the Esmor center was shut down by a riot set off by
abusive conditions.
</P>
<P>
   What they faced at the jail was considerably worse, they said in
court during the criminal trial. They testified that the guards
beat and punched them, knocked them to the ground and used pliers
to pull the hairs around their genitals. Some of the immigrants,
who came from countries including Nigeria, India and Algeria, have
since been deported. Others were granted asylum.
</P>
<P>
   Two guards _ James Rice, 42, a guard for 16 years, and Charles
Popovic, 35, an 11-year veteran _ were both convicted on nine
counts each of assault, misconduct and conspiracy to obstruct the
investigation. A Policemen's Benevolent Association official at the
jail, Michael Sica, 35, was also convicted on nine counts of
conspiracy to cover up misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy declined to say what part of the settlement would be
spent on fees for himself and another lawyer, Thomas Sheehan, of
Queens, who represents eight of the plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   Theodore Romankow, a lawyer representing Union County, said the
settlement would save the county as much as $3.5 million in legal
fees. ``All in all, it was a compromise based on fees and costs,''
he said. ``And for us, there was no admission of liability. We're
very pleased.''

JOLLITY AND SOME SERIOUS MOMENTS AT THE BESSIE AWARDS 
</HEADLINE>

 By JACK ANDERSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Dance Theater Workshop and the Danspace Project of
St. Mark's Church presented the 14th Annual Dance and Performance
Awards on Friday night at the Joyce Theater. The awards, chosen by
a panel of judges, are familiarly known as the Bessies, and are
named after Bessie Schonberg, a noted teacher of dance composition.
They honor achievements in dance and performance art, especially in
the downtown cultural world. As always, they attracted an
enthusiastic audience.
</P>
<P>
   Jollity prevailed in the presentation, hosted by Varla Jean
Merman, a singer and comedienne, and Doug Elkins, a choreographer,
both of whom kept turning up throughout the evening in outfits from
formal to funky. Yet there were also serious moments, as when David
White, executive director of Dance Theater Workshop, and Laurie
Uprichard, executive director of the Danspace Project, paid tribute
to the memory of Nancy Topf, an American dancer killed in the crash
of Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Village Voice underwrote awards of $1,000 for the
winners in the choreographer/creator category and of $500 in the
performer category. Choreographer and creator awards went to
Charles Atlas; B Team (a group made up of Zesty Meyers, Evan
Snyderman, Thor Bueno, Kelly Lamb and Jeff Zimmerman); Ronald K.
Brown; Jane Comfort; Douglas Dunn; David Neumann; Elizabeth Streb;
Doug Varone; and, for a collaborative venture by Mia Lawrence,
Douglas Henderson, Guy Yarden and Danielle Epstein.
</P>
<P>
   Performer awards were received by Hope L. Boykin; Hope Clark;
Lawrence Keigwin; Jaime Martinez; Pedro Ruiz; and Eddie Taketa.
</P>
<P>
   Special citations went to the Gowanus Arts Exchange for
supporting the arts in Brooklyn; Carla Maxwell for her achievements
as director of the Limon Dance Company since 1978; and to Mikki
Shepard, Laura Greer and Stephanie S. Hughley for presenting a
series of performances called ``Dance Women/Living Legends,'' a
celebration of black female choreographers.
</P>
<P>
   The composer awards honored collaborators: Mark Bennett, Robert
Black, Robert Een, Aska Kaneko and Hiroshi Yoshino, who provided
the music for Yoshiko Chuma's ``Unfinished Symphony''; Fellaheen
(made up of Robert Bonhomme, Patrick Fondiller, Robert Hohl and
Megan Spooner), which composed ``Duck, You Sucker'' for Neumann;
and Somei Satoh and the Kronos Quartet, creators of the music for
Eiko and Koma's ``River.''
</P>
<P>
   Lighting and visual design awards went to David Covey, Jeff
Fontaine, Nari Ward and, working in collaboration, Bill Ballou and
Michael Casselli. The program also included danced excerpts from
Brown's ``Gate Keepers'' and Varone's ``Bel Canto.''

SIGHHHHH: TOBIN CAN STOP HOLDING HIS BREATH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID CASSTEVENS  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - If lawyers can be disbarred, does it follow that
electricians can be delighted?
</P>
<P>
   Can cowboys be deranged?
</P>
<P>
   Models deposed?
</P>
<P>
   Garment workers debriefed?
</P>
<P>
   More to the point what about football coaches? Everyone knows
what happens if they don't win.
</P>
<P>
   Vince Tobin made the`` Guinness Book of World Records'' on
Sunday night. He joins some remarkable company, like the guy who
yodeled nonstop for 23 days and the woman who grew a 750-pound
turnip.
</P>
<P>
   Vince held his breath for three hours and three minutes. Only
when the last second ticked off the clock _ and the scoreboard read
Cardinals 17, Eagles 3 _ Tobin finally exhaled.
</P>
<P>
   It was like popping the ring top on a cold one. His
``sighhhhhhhh'' was pure bliss. What a relief.
</P>
<P>
   The term must win is overused in sports. But this home opener
fell into that category. In their first two games the Cardinals
were just awful. After lopsided defeats in Dallas and Seattle, the
third-year coach appeared pale and at a loss for words. Tobin
groped for positives in the post-mortem. The man wore defeat on his
face. He looked as if he had been slapped, a cracking open-handed
blow.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Lewis says the best gift he ever received was a film of
his wedding. Whenever he argues with his wife, the comedian says he
goes into a room, locks the door, runs the film backward and walks
out a free man.
</P>
<P>
   If only life had a rewind switch. Tobin wished he could start
the season over. But he couldn't.
</P>
<P>
   So the Cardinals`` had'' to beat the Eagles. They couldn't lose
at home against a winless team that hasn't won a road game since
the end of the 1996 season. The Cardinals aren't very good _ not
yet _ but the Eagles without their starting cornerbacks are worse.
</P>
<P>
   It was hot at kickoff, but the temperature on the field was
pleasant compared with the hot seat that awaited the coach if his
team had started this season of promise 0-3.
</P>
<P>
   If Tobin lost to the Eagles, there would be exit polls.
Grumbling fans would be asked which punishment they favored,
censure or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals made their coach sweat. After three quarters the
game was scoreless. ESPN which televised the snoozer nationally _
be glad it was blacked out here _ could hear the sets clicking off.
Only contractual obligations prevented the network from dumping the
game in favor of a snooker tournament, a dog show or that world's
strongest man contest in which stout grunting men named Ingemar and
Ernst sprint 50 yards with a water buffalo under each arm.
</P>
<P>
   The game was tedious. The Cards and Eagles wore out the middle
of the field. Finally, the home team, which earlier went 23{
minutes between first downs, awakened from a bad dream. Joe Nedney
nailed a 47-yard field goal (and kept his job) to tie the score,
3-3. Then the blitzing defense made the play that wins close games,
sacking backup quarterback Rodney Peete and stripping him of the
ball. Simeon Rice, who finally resembled the Simeon Rice we
remember, picked up the fumble and gave the Cardinals offense
possession at the Eagles 18. When Jake Plummer connected with
Johnny McWilliams in the end zone, Tobin _ cheeks puffed out, his
face a shade of lavender by now _ nodded with pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   Next possession, Adrian Murrell ran and ran and ran some more.
With Plummer mixing in short passes, the West Coast offense finally
clicked the the way it is supposed to, the way it must if the
Cardinals hope to compete. The Eagles wilted. The Cardinals went 86
yards and scored again.
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't show a lot of emotion. He isn't the guy at the New
Year's Eve party leading the conga line, a lampshade on his head.
But when it was over and Tobin could breath again, the coach felt
himself smile. This was a start for his team. A big win for the
Cardinals, and maybe a bigger win for him. &QL;

CARDINALS SHOW SIGNS OF NEW LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE SCHOENFELD  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Forgive the Cardinals for being delirious. Kodak
moments have come so infrequently in the last decade, they tend to
lose their heads in the euphoria.
</P>
<P>
   So it's understandable that defensive end Simeon Rice got
confused after his two sacks helped the Cardinals beat the
Philadelphia Eagles, 17-3, on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about making good on his prediction of a multiple-sack
game, Rice said, ``Just call me the great Mussolini.''
</P>
<P>
   He meant Houdini, or maybe Nostradamus.
</P>
<P>
   Rice and his defensive teammates are the reason the Cardinals'
season isn't over. They kept the team in the game until the offense
started to click in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals (1-2) scored 17 unanswered points in the final 13
minutes after falling behind, 3-0.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to win this game,'' offensive tackle Lomas Brown said.
``Had we lost, we would have been in dire straits.''
</P>
<P>
   They would have been embarrassed. The 39,782 fans at Sun Devil
Stadium would have booed them off the field. Radio talk show hosts
already were planning to bring out the dreaded bags to put over
their heads. The bashing would have lasted all week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would have been inconceivable, such an ugly situation,''
tight end Chris Gedney said.
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals, who moved within one-half game of first place in
the NFC East, appeared in trouble after Chris Boniol's 29-yard
field goal 40 seconds into the fourth quarter gave the Eagles a 3-0
lead.
</P>
<P>
   Offensive coordinator Marc Trestman was preaching patience on
the sidelines.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we can start to run the ball and have that kind of
balance, the passing game will take its course,'' Trestman said.
</P>
<P>
   On first down from the 20, running back Adrian Murrell raced
around left end for 28 yards, the team's longest run of the season.
Tight end Johnny McWilliams made two big blocks to free Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   One play later, quarterback Jake Plummer found Gedney in the
right flat for a 5-yard gain. Gedney ran out of bounds, but then
Eagles free safety Brian Dawkins was called for a personal foul for
knocking Gedney over the Philadelphia bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was trying to hold the guy up,'' Eagles Coach Ray Rhodes
said. ``(Dawkins) was not trying to run him into the bench. There
was a real short area between the sidelines and the bench.''
</P>
<P>
   The 15-yard penalty gave the Cardinals a first down at the
Eagles' 32 and set up Joe Nedney's career long 47-yard field goal.
</P>
<P>
   On the Eagles' next possession, middle linebacker Ronald
McKinnon blitzed and sacked quarterback Rodney Peete, who replaced
starter Bobby Hoying, who injured his back, in the third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   McKinnon knocked the ball loose, and Rice returned the fumble 10
yards to the Eagles' 18 with 9:49 left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a great (blitz) call by Coach (Dave) McGinnis,''
McKinnon said. ``I was surprised the hole next to the left guard
was so wide open, because usually the center will block back down.
When you have a hole that wide open, you have to make a play.''
</P>
<P>
   Rice thought he might score.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping, but my tank was on `E,' '' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It took the Cardinals only five plays to take the lead. On third
and goal from the 7, Plummer rolled right and threw a perfect pass
to McWilliams, who caught it in the end zone while on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a boot(leg) on,'' Plummer said. ``It's something I
love to do. . . . Johnny made a great play, he ran and got stopped
and just settled right in the hole in the end zone. All I had to do
was throw it to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Cardinals forced the Eagles (0-3) to punt, then got the ball
back on their 14 with 4:51 remaining. After a 26-yard reception by
McWilliams, they let Murrell and their offensive line take over.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, who finished with a game high 145 yards, put the game
away with a 25-yard score around left end with two minutes left.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Left guard Chris) Dishman said in the huddle, `We're going to
score on this play,' '' Murrell said. ``I looked him in the eye,
and I told him, `Well, I'm putting this one on you then.' If you
get me out of there on one guy, I'll make something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Murrell gained 101 yards on 12 carries in the fourth quarter to
become the Cardinals first 100-yard rusher in 31 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Late in the game, Lomas (Brown) and Dishman were just caving
their guys in, and Adrian was matched up on a defensive back and
making him miss,'' said Plummer, who completed 21 of 35 passes for
137 yards after a slow start in which the Cardinals got no
offensive first downs from 11:18 to go in the first quarter to 41
seconds left before halftime.
</P>
<P>
   But the Cardinals stayed in the game because the defense didn't
allow a touchdown for the first time since Nov. 20, 1994. &QL;

BRAVES PITCHING GIVES D-BACKS FITS  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks need one victory to avoid losing 100
games in their inaugural season. But at their current rate of
productivity _ or lack thereof _ that's no sure thing.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, the Atlanta Braves have what many regard as the best
pitching staff in the majors and perhaps the best overall ballclub.
But for the Diamondbacks to be shut out three times by them in a
four-game series _ the third time by left-hander Bruce Chen (who?)
_ there aren't too many excuses that can be valid.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's 10-0 setback also brought another sign of a possible
apocalypse _ there was a smattering of boos among Bank One
Ballpark's brie-and-blush crowd.
</P>
<P>
   Diamondbacks Manager Buck Showalter cranked up the Victrola and
set the needle down on the record that has become scratchy from
overuse: ``It's a challenge for us to put together offense for a
consistent period of time. It's something that we're going to have
to improve on.''
</P>
<P>
   Left is not right for Arizona. The Diamondbacks were shut out by
Braves left-hander Denny Neagle on Thursday night, beat
right-hander Greg Maddux on Friday night, but were shut out by
left-hander Tom Glavine on Saturday night and then by Chen on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was the 16th time that the Diamondbacks (62-95) have not
scored in a game _ second in the majors behind expansion partners
Tampa Bay (17).
</P>
<P>
   Chen was rated by ``Baseball America'' as Atlanta's top major
league prospect in 1997, but when the 1998 season began, he was at
Double-A Greenville. He went to Triple-A Richmond on Aug. 11 and
was called up to the big club on Sept. 11. He was 13-7 with a 3.29
ERA in 23 starts at Greenville and 2-1 with a 1.88 ERA in four
starts at Richmond.
</P>
<P>
   Making his third big-league start, Chen limited the Diamondbacks
to three hits in seven innings, walked two and struck out five.
</P>
<P>
   He walked two and gave up a hit in the first inning, then didn't
allow a hit through the next four. In the sixth, he gave up a
one-out double to Andy Fox and a single to Tony Batista, but they
were left stranded as Devon White popped out to Marty Malloy at
second base and Matt Williams popped out to Ozzie Guillen at
shortstop.
</P>
<P>
   Chen (2-0) worked one more hitless inning, finishing with 109
pitches, before right-hander Rudy Seanez and veteran left-hander
Norm Charlton wrapped things up.
</P>
<P>
   Fox said Chen's approach is similar to Glavine, whose victory on
Saturday night was his 20th of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He moves the ball around, changes speeds . . . and has enough
of a fastball to keep you honest,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   Though he shut out the Braves for the first three innings,
Diamondbacks right-hander Amaury Telemaco (6-10) struggled with his
control.
</P>
<P>
   He gave up a run in the fourth on a leadoff single by Malloy, a
one-out double to Andres Galarraga and a groundout by Ryan Klesko.
In the sixth, he issued the first two of his four walks. The first
_ Guillen _ scored on a sacrifice fly by Galarraga.
</P>
<P>
   In the seventh, Telemaco walked two of the first three men he
faced, and both _ Javier Jopez and Michael Tucker _ went on to
score. &QL;

CANUCKS STOP COYOTES  
 KHABIBULIN SHOWS RUST, ALLOWS 4 GOALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB MCMANAMAN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - Weren't the Vancouver Canucks supposed to be the team
with the goalie problem?
</P>
<P>
   It didn't look like it Sunday afternoon at America West Arena.
</P>
<P>
   The Coyotes were the ones starting to scratch their heads about
their situation between the pipes after getting poked by the
Canucks, 4-1, in their preseason home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Nikolai Khabibulin showed definite signs of rust, getting beat
for four goals on 22 shots, including one on a goofy mental
breakdown.
</P>
<P>
   Backup Jimmy Waite, meanwhile, who has looked extremely sharp in
training camp, suffered a pulled groin only seven minutes after
replacing Khabibulin to start the third period. Early reports are
that he will miss at least a week, perhaps longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Khabibulin) wasn't dreadful, but he obviously was
out-goaltended by the opposing goalie,'' Coyotes Coach Jim
Schoenfeld said.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Garth Snow, who wasn't given much chance of even
staying with the Canucks earlier this summer, let alone contend for
the No. 1 starting role. Vancouver made free-agent pitches to
Curtis Joseph and Mike Richter, and when it couldn't land either,
there was, and still is, talk of a possible major trade.
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, says Canucks Coach Mike Keenan. Not after what he
saw Sunday from Snow, who stoned the Coyotes with 30 saves.
</P>
<P>
   ``He played an excellent game for us,'' Keenan said. ``He looked
very strong in all aspects of the game. He played with a lot of
composure. He played with a great deal of consistency. I thought he
handled the puck exceptionally well, controlled the rebounds well.
He played with a great deal of confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like a top-form goaltender tonight. That's a great
sign for us. Hopefully, he'll step up to the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Khabibulin got stung twice in a 44-second span in the second
period, putting the Coyotes down, 2-0.
</P>
<P>
   First, Mark Messier swooped in and redirected Alexander
Mogilny's long rebound past the Coyotes goalie. Then, at the 8:54
mark, Khabibulin strayed behind the net to try and play a puck that
had been sent in by Dave Scatchard. He never had a chance _ and the
crowd of 12,231 knew it.
</P>
<P>
   It came along the back boards to Josh Holden, who zipped a
centering pass into the slot to an awaiting Matt Cooke. Khabibulin,
never known as a great puck handler, couldn't get back in time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a little mad about that play, but it happens,''
Khabibulin said.
</P>
<P>
   Asked to evaluate his overall play, he said: ``It wasn't too bad
for playing for the first time since April.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, you can expect goalie coach Benoit Allaire to do some
extra one-on-one fine-tuning with Khabibulin in the coming days.
Playing the puck behind the net, or deciding whether Khabibulin
should try it at all, most definitely will be discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I might be happier to see him do that in the preseason so it
doesn't happen in the regular season,'' Schoenfeld said.
``Sometimes, the lessons you learn have to be explicit. It's a
situation where you have to make sure you get that puck _ or you
don't go. . . . Certainly, you don't want to see a goal scored, but
if it hammers a lesson home, then maybe it's a good lesson.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the extra two feet now (behind the net), it's going to be
difficult for a lot of goaltenders to get out there and make the
play and get back in time.''
</P>
<P>
   After rookie center Trevor Letowski scored Phoenix's only goal,
a slap shot on the power play off a nice feed from defenseman Keith
Carney midway through the second period, Mogilny scored two goals
for Vancouver in the third to ice the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt pretty nice out there,'' Letowski said. ``They gave me
a chance to play on the power play, and that was fun. I got a great
pass from Carney, there was an open side, and I just put it home. I
had the exact same chance about a minute later, and I just didn't
get good wood on it.'' &QL; 
Note &QL; 
The first major wave of roster cuts could come as early as today.
After the game, Schoenfeld huddled with General Manager Bobby Smith
for several minutes. The Coyotes announced only one move afterward,
that they are assigning left wing Andrei Vasilyev to Las Vegas of
the International Hockey League. &QL;

`THROW IN' PLAYS PREMIUM GAME

   TEMPE, ARIZ. - He was a ``throw in'' in the big summer swap of
draft choices with San Diego, a trade designed to add depth and
still acquire  &UR; Andre
 &UR; Wadsworth, the player the Cardinals wanted to draft, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But when linebacker  &UR; Jamir Miller left because of a dislocated
left wrist in the second quarter of Sunday night's 17-3 victory
over the Philadelphia Eagles,  &UR; Patrick Sapp proved a big dividend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he played all right,'' Coach  &UR; Vince Tobin said of
Sapp, a former quarterback turned linebacker. ``It's hard to really
say without looking at films, but I think he made a couple of big
tackles (four in all).
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll get better and better, too. He's a quarterback who is
playing linebacker, but he certainly has the size and athleticism
to be good. We've got to keep working with him to get him better.''
</P>
<P>
   Cardinals team physician  &UR; Russell Chick said Miller will see a
hand surgeon this morning to see whether the injury requires
surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Mac the receiver &QL; 
 &UR; Chris Gedney is supposed to be the ``receiving'' tight end, and
 &UR; Johnny McWilliams' strength has been his blocking. But Sunday night
it was a sliding McWilliams who was on the end of  &UR; Jake Plummer's
7-yard touchdown pass for the eventual game winner, and it was
McWilliams who caught a 26-yard pass on third and 5 to keep the
drive alive to a clinching touchdown.
</P>
<P>
   But his three receptions for 39 yards notwithstanding, his
blocking prowess also stood out. He blocked two players on  &UR; Adrian
Murrell's 28-yard run to help set up the game-tying field goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the touchdown pass, I was supposed to slam my man and go
into the flat, but they came up and covered it, so I went to the
hole and Jake put it where only I could catch it,'' McWilliams
said. ``That last drive for the touchdown was all about pride. We
really worked hard and it paid off.'' &QL; 
McKinnon shines &QL; 
Middle linebacker  &UR; Ron McKinnon entered the game with 24 tackles
and on Sunday, he was in on 13, including 10 unassisted. He also
produced a sack, forced a fumble by  &UR; Rodney Peete and knocked
starting quarterback  &UR; Bobby Hoying from the game with a vicious
hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been waiting three years to get through clean like I did
when I sacked Peete,'' McKinnon said, smiling. ``I was surprised,
but I thought once I got there I better make something happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the other one (Hoying), I thought he was going to go down
(slide), but he kept running so I had to hit him. I'm sorry he got
hurt. I feel for him, but he's supposed to go down. The way our
front four played, it made my job so easy.  &QL; 
Confusion central &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Late in the second quarter, the Cardinals' frustration became
such that Plummer and several lineman were seen in an animated,
finger-wagging conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had some miscommunication, a little confusion on about
who was designated to block who, and we were trying to get it
worked out,'' Plummer said. ``I think they knew our signs. Every
time they were going to blitz, they seemed to know where we were
going to throw. I had some frustration, but I never had a loss of
hope.''

CARDS COME ON WITH A REAL RUSH IN FINAL QUARTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LEE SHAPPELL  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - In the end, the Cardinals certainly weren't in a
hurry, but they were in a rush.
</P>
<P>
   Unaccustomed as they are to leading late in the fourth quarter,
and having a ground game that has been well criticized, they were
presented with a challenge that could have large-picture
implications for the franchise.
</P>
<P>
   They had a 10-3 lead, the ball at their 14-yard line, and 4:53
to burn off the clock.
</P>
<P>
   Then Adrian Murrell and his offensive line did what few believed
was possible based on their opening two games. They dominated a foe
at the most critical juncture of a game and not only successfully
ran down the clock but also pounded in an insurance touchdown in a
17-3 win over Philadelphia in their home opener.
</P>
<P>
   Murrell, who became the Cardinals featured back the day he was
acquired from the New York Jets for a third-round pick, became the
Cardinals first 100-yard rusher since LeShon Johnson was a one-game
phenom in the fourth game of the 1996 season. Murrell, who had 44
yards rushing through three quarters, added 101 on 12
fourth-quarter carries.
</P>
<P>
   Among them was a 28-yard carry, aided by two downfield blocks by
tight end Johnny McWilliams, that set up a game-tying field goal
early in the final quarter, and later a 25-yard run for the
game-clinching touchdown with 1:52 to go.
</P>
<P>
   This is a team that averaged 78 rushing yards in its first two
games _ exactly what it averaged a year ago when it was last in the
NFL on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got the defense tired by running outside, then we ran up
the middle _ that was very effective for us,'' said Murrell. ``We
kept their defense on the field most of those last five minutes.
That was really to our advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Vince Tobin hopes that's a sign of things to come from a
youthful offense that had not picked up coordinator Marc Trestman's
West Coast offense quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Adrian ran extremely well,'' Tobin said. ``It's been a long
time since we had a 100-yard rusher. In the fourth quarter the
offensive line seemed to get stronger. They marched the length of
the field to get the first field goal, they punched it in for the
go-ahead touchdown, and at the end they ran out the clock.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offensive line has taken a lot of criticism, but at the
end it began to jell.''
</P>
<P>
   Having a veteran back who knows what to do with even the
smallest opening doesn't hurt, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more carries Adrian gets, the better and more confident he
is running behind our line,'' Tobin said. ``It is a new offense to
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is what I want. I want us to become a physical football
team that controls the line and is able to pound out the hard
yards. We did at the end. We controlled the line and picked up the
first downs. Now I would hope we can do that earlier in a game.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the tough yards came around the left side, where veteran
tackle Lomas Brown was cleaning house ahead of Murrell.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know it's only one game and we can revert back next week,
but it's been some time since we've been able to come in here after
a game feeling rewarded like this,'' Brown said. ``The guys in the
line took it upon ourselves there at the end to run out the clock
and help Adrian get his yards.''
</P>
<P>
   Outings such as this were commonplace for Murrell while covering
more than 1,000 yards for the Jets each of the past two seasons. He
was aware when the club let Leeland McElroy and Johnson go that he
was being handed the ball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are a young team, there are new guys _ I'm one of them _
and we're still trying to get a feel,'' Murrell said. ``We'd like
to have had a better start, but we stayed the course. This is what
we envisioned from this offense.'' &QL;

D-BACKS AT BAT: KINGS OF THE K  
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX - The Diamondbacks probably won't lose 100 games this
year, but they did nail one dubious achievement against the Atlanta
Braves on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   No National League team in history has struck out as often.
</P>
<P>
   When  &UR; Yamil Benitez fanned against &UR; Bruce Chen in the fifth
inning of a 10-0 loss to the Braves, it was strikeout No. 1,204,
breaking the previous record held by the 1968 New York Mets (who,
by the way, won the World Series the next season).
</P>
<P>
   ``He (Chen) threw the ball right there, and everybody was
swinging like crazy,'' Benitez said. ``Especially myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Braves pitchers struck out seven Diamondbacks, bringing the
season total to 1,207. With five games remaining, the major league
record of 1,268 held by the 1996 Detroit Tigers is presumably out
of reach.
</P>
<P>
   One of the strikeout victims was  &UR; Devon White, whose whiff in
the ninth inning made it an even 100 for the season. The
Diamondbacks now have four players with 100 strikeouts or more:
White, rookie  &UR; David
 &UR; Dellucci (102), rookie  &UR; Travis Lee (123) and &UR; Jay Bell (124).  &UR; Matt
 &UR; Williams and  &UR; Andy Fox are within range with 98 and 94,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   Manager  &UR; Buck Showalter, who was aware of the mark, cites a
couple of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a problem for most clubs that struggle,'' he said.
``Pitch selection. Hitting behind in the count a lot. Pitch
recognition. A lot of young players. Also, strikeouts are up
because of the long ball. People will give up strikeouts for home
runs. It's more and more of a tendency.''
</P>
<P>
   Squib hits &QL; 
A throwing error by catcher  &UR; Damian Miller ended the Diamondbacks'
streak of 79 straight errorless innings, a club record. The
Diamondbacks have committed 97 errors this season, tied for second
fewest in the National League with San Francisco and New York. The
Braves lead with 90.
</P>
<P>
   Following a difficult pregnancy, &UR; Josneil Daal, the wife of
Diamondbacks left-hander  &UR; Omar Daal, gave birth early Saturday
morning. Josneil and baby  &UR; Nicolas, born a month premature and the
couple's second son, are doing fine.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has been named Diamondbacks winner of the
 &UR; Roberto Clemente Man of the Year Award. Williams is eligible to win
the national Clemente award. &QL;

`THE FIRST STEP TOWARD SOME THING BIG' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN BICKLEY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - Simeon limped to his locker, cringing as he tried
to get dressed. He smiled for a moment, and then the moment was
gone, stolen away by a searing pain in his back.
</P>
<P>
   ``What hurts?'' he said. ``Everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Two feet away, Eric Swann was in full uniform. A grass stain
above his shoulder pads, gloves on his hands, the glow of victory
dripping from his face.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first step toward something big,'' Swann said.
</P>
<P>
   If anything is to become of the season, they will remember this.
The night when it all could've exploded, when a mutiny could've
arisen from the disparity, from the frustration, from one side that
refused to do its part.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, it was the night when the defense rescued, and in the
end, liberated the offense. A night when the defense saved the game
until it won the game. A night when two parts became one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how you become a championship team,'' Swann said. ``No
matter what happens, we're in the foxhole together.''
</P>
<P>
   Granted, these were the Eagles. But the defense was on the field
for a whopping 59 plays. They endured an offensive series that
lasted 45 seconds. Another that lasted 12 seconds. An offense that
went nearly 24 minutes without a first down.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of taxation that can easily turn one side
against the other. It's happened to better teams than this one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We understood the fight,'' Rice said. ``And we understood that
there were no rules in the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet it all changed in one instant, when a blitzing Ronald
McKinnon separated Rodney Peete from the football. Rice recovered
deep in Eagles' territory. Suddenly revived, the offense scored a
touchdown. And on the next possession, handed a lead for the first
time this season, they simply marched down the field for another.
</P>
<P>
   The sparse crowd of 39,782 _ or 5,000 less than the last-place
Diamondbacks drew on Sunday _ reveled in the moment. Earlier, they
had booed Jake Plummer, booed the offense, booed anyone in red for
an inept attack. Now, they were cheering wildly, rewarded for their
optimism, relieved that a season had been saved.
</P>
<P>
   And inside the Cardinals' locker room, they breathed a heavy
sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a struggle,'' Rice said. ``That team is nobody's
punk.''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to the defense, neither are the Cardinals. They have won
their home opener for two consecutive years. They are back in the
division race. And after holding the Eagles to a field goal, they
have tasted their destiny, a fearsome defense that opens the door
for everyone else.
</P>
<P>
   It was a night when they knocked Bobby Hoying into another solar
system. When Patrick Sapp filled in admirably for an injured Jamir
Miller. When Rice made good with two sacks and had another
nullified by a penalty. When Swann terrorized the interior like a
mad bull. When Tommy Knight produced eight tackles to spearhead the
secondary. When even a wet-eared Andre Wadsworth got in on the act.
</P>
<P>
   When McKinnon continued a stellar individual season with the
biggest play of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``This picks everybody up,'' McKinnon said. ``We were walking
around 0-2, and everybody was trying to find a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the offense is still a mystery. They have been
blanked in six of 12 quarters this season, and the new West Coast
attack has been the yawn of a new era. But now the pressure is off,
and they can build on the last two drives.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe now the stadium won't be plagued with empty seats.
Football is king in America. In most cities, you'd have to know
someone special to get a ticket for the home opener. In most
cities, attendance is a civic responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Here, you are waiting for a winner, proof that these aren't the
same old Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have a vision for this team,'' Vince Tobin said.
``Before the game, I saw all the people in red. Some day, there's
going to be the whole stadium packed with people wearing red and
cheering and having a great time.''
</P>
<P>
   Some day has to start some place. And maybe this was the first
hurdle. &QL;

DEFENSIVE PROBLEMS PLAGUE ASU 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By PAOLA BOIVIN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. - With all due respect to Bruce Snyder's ``One at a
time'' philosophy, it may be time to look at the big picture.
Considering what the Pac-10 did this weekend, Arizona State might
not like what it sees.
</P>
<P>
   The league went 8-0 in non-conference games. In the only Pac-10
battle, No. 18 Southern California beat Oregon State, 40-20, in a
game much closer than the score indicates. The Beavers visit Sun
Devil Stadium Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ASU's 34-15 victory over North Texas gave the team an emotional
lift, but it also demonstrated that the Sun Devils still have
significant problems to address.
</P>
<P>
   ``Offensively, we've showed flashes of being a real good team,
although we're not consistent enough,'' Snyder said. ``But I like
what we have to work with and think we can be a real good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defensively, I knew it was going to take a while, but we may
be behind where we thought we would be. I like some individual
efforts, but we're not playing real well as a unit.''
</P>
<P>
   The Sun Devils yielded 373 yards after North Texas had managed
just 264 in two previous games. The Mean Green went from 44 rushing
yards a week ago to 192 Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ASU, a team many speculated could be a candidate for the Rose or
even Fiesta Bowl, now seems better suited for a trip to Hawaii. The
Nos. 4 and 5 Pac-10 teams will play in Honolulu on Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem is ASU's defensive struggles, but conference
parity is also an issue.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling Stanford raised some eyebrows by defeating North
Carolina, 37-34. California has held Nebraska and Oklahoma to 24
and 12 points, respectively. Granted No. 22 Oregon beat up on a
weak opponent, San Jose State, but it did it by 55 points. No. 4
UCLA scored 42 in its win over Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Is there a weak link on the schedule anymore?
</P>
<P>
   Even though Oregon State, which visits Saturday, has struggled
in recent years, the Beavers always seem to give ASU a fight. Three
of the Sun Devils' last four victories against them have been by
fewer than 10 points.
</P>
<P>
   ASU travels to Los Angeles on Oct. 3 to play USC, a team that is
averaging 34 points a game behind a young quarterback. Notre Dame
visits a week later.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder doesn't even want to think about his team starting 1-5.
</P>
<P>
   He's just trying to keep his team from looking beyond Oregon
State. With good reason. The defense can't afford to daydream.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder and his staff tried to answer this question Sunday: Is
the problem execution, or personnel?
</P>
<P>
   ASU hopes it's the former, because that's something that can
improve over time. The Sun Devils' inexperience (eight new starters
on defense) has been evident in the three games.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been playing with some real young players,'' Snyder
said. ``That doesn't mean it has to be a problem, but often it is.
</P>
<P>
   ``They tend to get tired faster. They tend to not be able to
concentrate as well from one play to another. They're more
tentative than veterans.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder is desperate for a leader, or at least a dominant player,
to step forward on defense. Last season, linebacker Pat Tillman and
safety Damien Richardson had a galvanizing effect on the rest of
the unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Tillman) could get everybody lined up,'' Snyder said. ``And
Damien Richardson . . . (safety) Mitchell Freedman knew exactly
that Damien would force the ball back to him. He trusted him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder was encouraged by some aspects of Saturday's game.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Baker averaged 59.5 yards a punt and is ranked second in
the nation. Redshirt freshman Courtney Palmore had a strong outing
in the secondary and on special teams. Wide receiver Kenny
Mitchell, who had a 60-yard touchdown reception, had an impressive
game, and Snyder feels strong safety Christon Rance is improving.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference I saw is what practice did for us,'' Snyder
said. ``That's what's important to me.'' &QL; 
Notes &QL; 
Tailback J.R. Redmond is nursing a sprained toe.
</P>
<P>
   Snyder inserted Mike Gauthier for one extra-point Saturday night
and is considering using him again for that role, even though Baker
may be asked to kick field goals.

ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE GAINS ACCEPTANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   By BILL WORKMAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCISCO _ Nearly 70 percent of Americans now turn to
alternative forms of medicine _ from acupuncture to tai chi and
guided imagery _ to cure their ills when regular medicine has
failed, according to a nationwide survey released at Stanford
University.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The random telephone survey of 1,000 people also showed that 56
percent of those interviewed believe their health plans should
cover alternative care. They are also willing to pay for it in
their medical insurance premiums.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we see from this survey and many other indicators is that
people generally want to take control of their own health, using
those services they find most effective,'' said William Haskell, a
Stanford professor of medicine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This places responsibility on both traditional care providers
and health educators to ensure that responsible information and
advice are available to patients,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   While the survey reflected the growing acceptance of alternative
medicine in the United States, it said roughly half the people who
seek out alternative practitioners still rely on Western medicine
for basic health care. On average, participants in the study made
four visits annually to a conventional doctor.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, those surveyed said that their decision whether
to consult a conventional physician or a practitioner of
alternative medicine, was guided principally by the practitioner's
``technical skills at diagnosis and treatment.''
</P>
<P>
   The findings were released at a conference on alternative and
complementary medicine held last week at Stanford Medical Center
and attended by more than 500 physicians and other health care
professionals from across the nation. The survey was conducted by
the Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   Haskell is the principal investigator for Stanford in a major
federally funded study of the effectiveness of complementary and/or
alternative medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Five years ago, a landmark survey by Harvard Medical School
revealed that 1 in 3 Americans used nontraditional medicine,
spending $14 billion a year in treatments.
</P>
<P>
   The Stanford findings did not include patient expenditures for
alternative medicine. But, on average, survey respondents said they
would be willing to spend an additional $15.41 a month in health
insurance for complementary services such as chiropractic, massage
or acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   While many physicians are still skeptical of alternative
medicine, a growing number of patient care organizations offer
complementary services in clinics alongside traditional medicine or
reimburse patients for alternative treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Public interest in alternative medicine presents some challenges
and obligations for traditional physicians, said Wes Alles of the
Stanford Center for Research in Disease Prevention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we are talking about vitamins, yoga, acupuncture,
massage or a variety of other practices, physicians should be
candid with their patients about which techniques they feel are
most appropriate for each patient,'' he said.

COUGARS WIPING OUT SIERRA BIGHORN SHEEP, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   By GLEN MARTIN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
    SAN FRANCSICO _ Mountain lions may be pushing endangered Sierra
Nevada bighorn sheep to extinction, and wildlife biologists say
they are unable to do anything about it.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The scientists maintain that a simple solution to the problem
exists but that it cannot be carried out because of the growing
trend of crafting public policy _ including wildlife policy _ at
the ballot box.
</P>
<P>
   Cougars were given sweeping protection in a 1990 state ballot
initiative after widespread popular concern about the stability of
their population. The big cats multiplied dramatically, and they
began gobbling up the bighorns with a vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   Wildlife biologists would like to eliminate a few of the most
voracious cats to give the sheep a little breathing room. But the
1990 initiative allows cougars to be killed only if they threaten
people, pets or livestock. Endangered species are not covered in
the exemption.
</P>
<P>
   And to the frustration of the scientists, supporters of the big
cats are fighting any moves to change that part of the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have no vision of conservation,'' said bighorn expert
John Wehausen, a biologist with the University of California's
White Mountain Research Station, in criticism of the Mountain Lion
Foundation, his primary opponent on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're an animal rights group, not an environmental group,''
said Wehausen. ``We (wildlife biologists) are concerned with
habitat preservation and maintaining rich biodiversity, but they're
concerned with the life of a particular animal in a particular
place. They essentially reject science.''
</P>
<P>
   Lynn Sadler, the executive director of the Mountain Lion
Foundation, countered that the link between mountain lion predation
and bighorn declines has not been adequately demonstrated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Predators eat endangered species all the time,'' she said.
``It's what they were put on this planet to do. Not far from here,
great horned owls are eating endangered Swainson's hawks.''
</P>
<P>
   Mountain lions do eat some bighorns, Sadler acknowledges, ``but
it has never been proven that eliminating lions will take care of
the bigger problems bighorns are facing.''
</P>
<P>
   Sadler said Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep live in a harsh alpine
environment that makes survival problematic under any circumstance.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Sadler, killing sheep-eating lions would probably
do little good because the cats have a highly developed sense of
territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``When one lion is removed, another moves in,'' she said.
``Younger mountain lions are always waiting for the opportunity to
exploit territory controlled by an older animal.''
</P>
<P>
   Until the past few years, Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep _ cousins
of the more numerous desert bighorn _ were staging an impressive
comeback after dancing on the brink of extinction for almost a
century.
</P>
<P>
   Although they had once ranged across the spine of the Sierra,
these magnificent animals had been reduced to a few isolated herds
by 1900.
</P>
<P>
   Disease and overhunting were the primary culprits. Bighorns are
exceedingly susceptible to domestic sheep maladies, and bighorn
meat was considered so succulent and delicious that it was featured
on the menus of restaurants in Bodie, now a deserted mining town on
the eastern slope of the Sierra.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1970s, only about 250 sheep were left. They lived in
two herds in the central Sierra, one on Mount Baxter and another on
Mount Williamson. In 1986, biologists began transplanting animals
from the Baxter herd to Lee Vining Canyon, just outside Yosemite
National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The animals thrived, and other transplants followed, to both the
Lee Vining Canyon area and Mount Langley in the southern Sierra. By
1991, the Sierra Nevada bighorn population stood at about 400
animals and was expanding rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was fantastic,'' recalled Wehausen, a lean, gangly man with
a spare ginger-colored beard. ``The herds were growing at 24
percent a year _ that's a remarkable rate.''
</P>
<P>
   But that began to change, biologists say, with the passage of
Proposition 117 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   The state's cougar population climbed quickly after the measure
was approved and is now estimated at 5,000 animals. Within two
years of the initiative's passage, biologists began to note a
dramatic increase in the number of sheep killed by lions.
</P>
<P>
   Further, researchers say, the lions were changing the bighorn's
behavior in a way that was anything but healthy for the bighorns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always knew that lions killed sheep,'' said Leslie Chow, a
biologist with the U.S. Geological Service who studies cougars in
Yosemite National Park through a grant from the Yosemite Fund.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as the '90s went on, we saw more and more predation from
lions,'' said Chow, ``especially during the winter, when the sheep
are stressed from the weather and lack of food.''
</P>
<P>
   And the problems were compounded when the sheep retreated to
higher altitudes to escape the lions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point that the sheep stopped going down to the
lower terrain where the winter feed was good,'' Chow said.
``Instead, they wintered out higher up.''
</P>
<P>
   And the higher the range, the less forage there is during the
brutal Sierra winter, Chow said. Sheep emerge from the snowy months
in poor condition, making them particularly vulnerable to disease,
parasites and predators.
</P>
<P>
   ``They also have fewer lambs, since breeding success is pegged
to good winter nutrition,'' said Chow.
</P>
<P>
   Wehausen said Sierra Nevada bighorns are about to become
extinct, and the only hope for their salvation is a captive
breeding program similar in scope to the one undertaken for the
California condor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a matter of maybe,'' he said. ``We're at the crisis
point right now. There are fewer than 100 Sierra Nevada bighorns
left _ that's totaling all the herds. Somehow, we have to come up
with funding by this winter so we can start capturing some of the
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Such a solution is hardly ideal, said Wehausen. Bighorns breed
readily in captivity but they lose many of their natural instincts
when penned, making them easy pickings for predators when and if
they are re-introduced to the wild.
</P>
<P>
   Great care must also be taken with the breeding program to
ensure that the offspring are not excessively inbred, Wehausen
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are incredibly valuable genes,'' said Wehausen, ``and it
would be tragically easy to lose them.''
</P>
<P>
   The biologists say there is a far better and simpler solution to
the problem than captive breeding _ selective control of the
cougars.
</P>
<P>
   Chow thinks that mountain lion populations are at an all-time
high in California, exceeding the numbers that existed in the
centuries before European contact. In those days, grizzly bears may
have kept cougars in check, Chow said. Grizzlies are now extinct in
California.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not as though the situation now is `natural,''' Chow
said. ``California's wild ecosystems have been dramatically
manipulated for centuries. There's compelling evidence that a lion
population of this density is quite unusual.''
</P>
<P>
   Lions are highly individualistic animals, said Chow, and quickly
develop specific tastes when it comes to prey.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a species, they heavily favor deer,'' he said. ``But some
get particularly adept at taking other prey _ bighorns, for
example. When we could still legally take lions, we found that
removing one or two problem animals from bighorn range greatly
reduced (sheep) mortality.''
</P>
<P>
   The California Department of Fish and Game concurs with that
view and supported a bill introduced in the state Assembly last
year that would have allowed a limited take of lions in the Sierra
under a special research program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was apparent to us that a few lions _ or even one lion _
could have a devastating effect on the remaining Sierra Nevada
bighorns,'' said Steve Torres, a Fish and Game biologist in charge
of the agency's bighorn sheep programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the rules of predator/prey relations don't really apply
when the prey is in danger of extinction,'' said Torres. ``In any
wildlife management scenario, the predator should not eliminate the
prey.''
</P>
<P>
   But the legislation promptly died when the Mountain Lion
Foundation indicated its opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Under Proposition 117, (killing lions) is strictly against the
law,'' said Sadler. ``We're not opposed to studying possible
solutions to the bighorn problem, nor are we opposed to relocating
problem lions. But the people of California have made it plain that
they don't want to see mountain lions hunted and killed.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, said Sadler, she is by no means comfortable with Fish
and Game's evaluation of the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish and Game's science has proved highly suspect in the past,
and I believe that could certainly be the case here,'' she said.
``The bighorn's problems didn't start with mountain lions, and they
don't end with them. Overhunting, domestic livestock diseases and
habitat loss are far more pressing problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet Torres reiterates that the crisis facing the Sierra Nevada
bighorn demands immediate action and says the sheep's plight points
to a larger issue. Increasingly, he said, wildlife policy is
determined by voters rather than biologists.
</P>
<P>
   ``More and more, the (initiative process) is controlling the way
we manage our wildlife,'' Torres said, ``with sentiment and emotion
often counting for more than science. You end up with these
broad-brush approaches that don't allow biologists the flexibility
they need to address regional problems.''

MOVING TO LIGHT RAIL CAN BE A CALCULATED BET ON THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ An orange and brown railroad depot, its
gingerbread architecture revealing its 1870s origin, sits on the
east side of Hiawatha Avenue here, a few minutes southeast of
downtown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Known to Milwaukee Road station agents as ``The Princess,'' the
old station is a museum now, a symbol of Victorian days when, as
the historical sign next to it says, ``ladies in bustles and
gentlemen in high collars'' got around town by rail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If things go as planned, five years from now modern ladies and
gentlemen (a projected 24,000 a day) will ride past this spot in
sleek new light-rail cars that will run the dozen or so miles
between downtown and a little south of the Mall of America in
suburban Bloomington. Along the way this $446 million system
(estimated in 1997 dollars) will have stops for the Metrodome
sports stadium, the University of Minnesota, several residential
areas, a VA hospital, Fort Snelling and the international airport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities' 22 new light-rail cars will be a small but
crucial part of an improved transit system that will continue to
rely heavily on buses, including some running in dedicated
``busways'' on highways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But light rail clearly represents what Curt Johnson, once an
opponent of this mode of transit but now a supporter and a major
figure in getting it going here, calls a ``breakout strategy, some
way to raise the stakes, some way to lift transit to a different
level in the mind of the public.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This leap of faith to light rail, says Peter McLaughlin, a
Hennepin County government official through whose district the new
cars will run, ``is about changing the image of a major public
service.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As other cities think about whether and how light rail can
become part of their transit mix, the lessons to be learned from
the Minneapolis-St. Paul experience are many. But none is clearer
than this: Committing to a new vision of public transit is
incredibly complicated and fraught with countless opportunities for
failure. It requires brave leadership that understands what it's
doing and can hold together a necessary coalition of public and
private interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of major infrastructure investments are
permanently fragile,'' says Johnson, who heads the Metro Council,
the powerful regional governing body that oversees an agency called
Metro Transit, which runs the area bus system and also will operate
the light-rail trains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The area's journey to having light rail has been a frustrating
milk run, not an express trip. For decades, proponents of light
rail fought with people who argued it was too costly and
inefficient compared with just improving bus service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We paralyzed each other for 20 years,'' says Johnson. ``We
just continued our automobile dependence and let time pass. We
carried out a nearly ritualistic argument in which rail advocates
would resurrect their best theories about what rail would do for
our transportation abilities and our culture. Skeptics, including
myself, would trot out our several arguments about efficiency,
about how little impact it would make on congestion numbers, how
much money would disappear into a black hole. . .'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And because the region enjoyed steady economic growth and no
crises, ``we could afford this exquisite little argument among
elites,'' Johnson says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he says, ``I came to a point where I realized that
impact mattered more than efficiency.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The impact he's talking about is both getting people to think of
public transit as a reasonable alternative to cars and using light
rail as ``a tool for redevelopment'' along the Hiawatha corridor, a
stretch of mostly unattractive small businesses and light industry
along a four-lane street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What turned Johnson around on this question was political
reality. First, he realized the state legislature and other funding
sources would never provide the large influx of cash needed to
improve the bus system radically. Second, he and Peter McLaughlin
made a political deal. Johnson would support light rail if
McLaughlin would push for additional financing for buses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the stars were aligned right for the Twin Cities.
Not only was Hiawatha Avenue, as part of long-planned improvements,
slated for reconstruction, but two Minnesota members of Congress _
Democrats Martin Sabo and Jim Oberstar _ were in key House
positions to help the region get federal funding for light rail if
local leaders could ever get behind one plan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument,'' says McLaughlin, ``was, we're dinking around
with $3 million projects and $1 million projects and we're
squandering this incredible opportunity to raise the level of our
transit system. If we blow this now we're going to be stuck for
another generation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many regions count on federal help for 80 percent of such
projects. But the Twin Cities is committed to paying about 50
percent. And federal funding, though not finally assured for the
$200-plus million needed, is now reasonably well lined up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A big part of that success falls to McLaughlin for his efforts
to get the seven counties in the metro area to agree on the
Hiawatha corridor as the first priority for light rail _ or, if
money for light rail could not be found, for busways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything like this takes one or more champions,'' says
Johnson. ``Peter put this at the center of his work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several other transit corridors are on the drawing board now,
and there is some contention over which one will get to be second
and third. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gary Erickson, director of Hennepin County's Department
of Transit and Community Works, says he's ``very concerned that the
fight over who's No. 2 could jeopardize the one they're all
behind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But so far what Johnson calls a permanently fragile coalition is
holding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another threat to transit progress here is the odd manner of
funding it. In addition to bus fares and state and federal
contributions, the region pays for transit with local property
taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dependence on the property tax,'' says McLaughlin, ``is a
huge, huge problem.'' That system, says Johnson, ``desperately
needs to be changed'' because it's ``a guarantee of on-going
political arguments about fairness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Twin Cities' commitment to light rail, for all its fits
and starts, appears now to be well thought-out and reasonable, even
though many headaches may lie ahead in the inevitably difficult
details. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful transit systems,'' says Art Leahy, general manager
of Metro Transit, ``have used rail to improve the entire transit
system.'' Clearly that's the plan here, along with economic
redevelopment where the rail line will run. Area leaders have
decided to risk higher initial costs to achieve a long-term impact.
It's the kind of calculated bet on the future an area can make when
it has thoughtful, confident leadership with shared vision. &QL;

 c. 1997 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL _ Twin Cities officials are about a year away from
letting a contract for design and construction of a 12-plus mile
light-rail system from downtown Minneapolis to the airport to the
Mall of America and beyond _ all operated by an agency of the
regional governing body, the Metro Council, headquartered here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Construction could begin six to eight months after that, with
the line opening in the summer of 2003. Though no two regions are
exactly alike, here are some lessons other cities can learn from
the Twin Cities' experience: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating a light-rail system can be agonizingly slow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These things take a long time _ six to 10 years to get the
first piece done.'' _ Gary Erickson, director of Hennepin County's
Department of Transit and Community Works. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these solutions will be quick and painless.'' _ state
Rep. Myron Orfield, a land-use planning advocate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget light rail unless it's an integrated part of a sensibly
balanced regional transit system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't just look at kind of a hot alignment that seems to be
the thing you can get people rallying around initially because
sooner or later you're going to have the detractors to that
alignment that, if you really didn't think it through, could find
the fatal flaw that's just going to knock it out of the water.'' _
Erickson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision here is to have a whole interlocking network of
transit ways all over this region.'' It will include light rail,
commuter rail, regular bus routes and dedicated busways on
highways. _ Curt Johnson, Metro Council chairman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that (light rail) is only a piece, and if
it's wildly successful it won't serve but 10 to 15 percent of our
ridership.'' _ Stephen L. Morris, director of transit development
for Metro Transit, the Metro Council agency that operates the bus
system and that will run light rail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a unified regional system that's easy for riders to
use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a seamless system. We're going to have free transfers
from buses to rail and rail to buses. We're going to have a bus
feeder system run by Metro Transit timed to lead to trains as
they're going down Hiawatha Avenue.'' _ Peter McLaughlin, Hennepin
County commissioner and chairman of the Metropolitan Light Rail
Transit Joint Powers Board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Light rail won't solve all transportation problems but without
it the future may be limited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Transit is not going to prevent or cure congestion. There's no
illusion about that. But having a serious transit infrastructure
could eventually give (the residents of) this region choices.'' _
Johnson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to have a 24-hour city, you need transit. You
can't build the appropriate density without the commitment to
transit.'' _ John DeWitt, head of ``Transit for Livable
Communities,'' a community-based advocacy group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen to opponents. (Among those historically asking hard
questions about light rail in the Twin Cities have been the
editorial boards of the Star-Tribune in Minneapolis and the Pioneer
Press in St. Paul.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to have naysayers. They are good in the
process. They can bring out things that you might otherwise not
think about.'' _ Erickson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Focusing on light rail doesn't mean you can ignore the rest of
public transit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You establish rail as a flagship. But you should not allow
under any circumstances the bus system to become second class.'' _
Art Leahy, general manager of Metro Transit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand the fundamental characteristics of different
transit modes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Rail is powerful but fragile. Buses are very durable.'' _
Leahy, who points out that because light rail, which can haul large
numbers of people quickly, runs on fixed tracks, the whole system
can get stopped when one overhead electrical power line comes down
or another rail car stalls on those tracks. Buses, which carry
fewer people, nonetheless are flexible and can go around trouble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The devil is deeply embedded in the details. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hire management staff with real rail experience.'' _ Leahy,
who is doing that now and who notes that it takes months of
rigorous training for drivers, maintenance workers and other
employees to learn how to run light rail properly and to prepare
for every emergency from suicides on the tracks to electrical
storms that cut power to the system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaders should lead, and not wait too long to imagine the
future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Majority politics will not demand action on the transportation
front until most people find congestion unspeakable. By the time
most people do, it's too late to do anything about it. So you have
to have people running the risks up front, of saying we've got to
begin to build this infrastructure.'' _ Johnson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>

CLINTON HAD BETTER WAYS TO SPEND HIS SPARE TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I know you're tired of Bill and Monica and Ken and cigars and
all that. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And so am I, but it looks for all the world as if this story
will continue for days and weeks and months. Or at least until,
say, Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa sign a multi-year contract to be a
nude-wrestling tag team on cable TV. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But before you burn your last copy of the Starr Report, let's
ponder _ on the assumption the sex allegations it contains are true
_ the goofy priorities of the president of the United States and
how appalling it is that he chose to have sexual relations with a
White House intern on dates when there were so many other things
going on that should have kept him busy. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For instance, their first sexual encounter was Nov. 15, 1995. My
word. What was Bill Clinton thinking? Nov. 15 is the birthday of
the late and great American artist Georgia O'Keeffe. Why wasn't
Clinton celebrating that instead of having enough free time on his
hands to fool around with Monica? Or why, instead of starting down
this long and tawdry road, wasn't he on the phone to Judge Joseph
Wapner, wishing him a happy 76th birthday on that date? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, the report says, Clinton and Lewinsky had their
second sexual encounter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why, when I read that, I nearly exploded with rage and
disbelief. Instead of debasing himself in this way, Bill Clinton
should have been celebrating the 51st birthday of pitching great
Tom Seaver. Either that or giving a speech about freedom of the
press to honor famed 18th century journalist John Peter Zenger, who
was arrested Nov. 17, 1734, for libel against the colonial
government in his New York Weekly Journal. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Zenger was acquitted and, thus, helped plant the idea of press
freedom in the New World, which in turn has led to Matt Drudge. So
there you are. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next time the president and Monica got together in an
intimate sort of way was New Year's Eve of 1995. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Well, I declare. Any regular person should be busy celebrating
the end of one year and the beginning of another every Dec. 31. But
if that's not enough to keep you out of trouble, what about the
annual nationwide celebration of the opening of the first bank in
U.S. history on Dec. 31, 1781, which raises the question of what
that first bank gave new depositors as gifts _ coal toasters? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If that wasn't enough to keep Clinton out of trouble, he could
have been on the phone wishing John Denver a happy 52nd birthday
while Denver was still around to be called. How do you explain such
ridiculous choices? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And who but Bill Clinton would have devoted part of Jan. 7,
1996, to more sex with Monica when he should have been leading the
national celebration of Millard Fillmore's birthday? The more I
think about his lapse in this regard the angrier I get, especially
because of the debt Clinton owes Fillmore, who once ran for
president as a candidate of the ``Know-Nothing Party.'' Which is
exactly what was happening near the Oval Office on that January day
_ a party in which both participants later would claim to know
nothing. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The rest of the sexual encounter dates in the report are just as
disturbing for what the president was NOT doing. On Jan. 21, 1996,
for instance, why wasn't Clinton spending time commemorating the
birth on that date in 1821 of John C. Breckinridge, 14th vice
president of the United States? I certainly was, having just three
days earlier celebrated my own 51st birthday. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 4, he should have been celebrating Sri Lankan
independence day. But here's the worst one: On March 31, 1996, he
was doing his cigar thing with Monica when he should have been
observing Al Gore's 48th birthday with all the rest of us. I tell
you, a good calendar might have prevented all this. &QL;

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: Struggling with an old secret
 &HT;    (For release, Sept. 23, 1998)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   My wife claims she has videotape of it, but I do not believe
her; maybe 8mm movies, that I can believe. But they will be grainy
and, well, no one has one of those 8mm projectors any more.
</P>
<P>
   We are talking about possible documentation of something I have
tried to hide for a good while. I'm not proud of it. It is the
skeleton in my closet.
</P>
<P>
   As we are quite aware, skeletons are being pulled from closets
these days at alarming rates. In fact, with so many gays and
lesbians coming out of the closet and, now, all those racy
skeletons coming out of the closets of public officials, there at
last is considerable room in the closets for clothing.
</P>
<P>
   For more than three decades, I have lived under the shadow of
disgrace. I have admitted my sin on several occasions but warned
those to whom I admitted it that to broadcast it generally would
cause further embarrassment to our family.
</P>
<P>
   The last thing I would want is to have it on CNN; oh, the shame!
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it has become obvious that nothing can be kept
secret in this country any more. We are a nation of voyeurs, and
your turn will come just as surely as there are death and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   So I have decided to go public with it, and try to tell my side
of it before someone else presents the embarrassing details.
</P>
<P>
   The transgression: As a parent of four small children, I would
take them home from the circus at intermission, telling them that
the show had ended! My wife was a co-conspirator of sorts,
protesting what I was doing but smiling all the time.
</P>
<P>
   All four of our children grew up thinking that a circus ended in
about one-and-a-half hours. They never saw the grand finale!
</P>
<P>
   I tried to live with this lie for years but finally broke down
and admitted it, first to my oldest daughter when she told me how
exhausting it was taking her first child to the circus. The shows
are so much longer than when she was a child, she claimed.
</P>
<P>
   My lie would have to unravel.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell him at intermission that the circus is ended,'' I advised
her.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's awful, Dad,'' she responded. ``Who would do that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Me,'' I answered sheepishly, ``_ and your mother, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean...?'' her words halted as she conjured an image of
years earlier.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, dear, we lied to you when we said the circus was over. We
were worn out; there were four of you. All that cotton candy, and
the Cracker Jacks, you guys were a mess. We had to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time of this conversation, my daughter was in her late
20s. Deeply affected by the confession, she immediately told her
brothers and sister. For a while, it was a terrible thing to live
down.
</P>
<P>
   It was not much later that the tide turned. All four siblings,
now with their own children, and the circus coming to town again,
began to think differently about what we had done to them. Not such
a bad idea, they thought.
</P>
<P>
   None have come to me directly and said they left at
intermission, but I believe several have. At times, it can be seen
as a survival thing.
</P>
<P>
   What is the moral of all this? Not much, other than not to cheat
your children. Or perhaps the moral is not to admit to anything _
until and unless the videotape is produced.
</P>
<P>
   There, I'm out of the closet. Judge me as you will. But before
you do, take a look at the polls. How many other parents would like
to rush their kids out of the circus at intermission?

MOVING TO LIGHT RAIL CAN BE A CALCULATED BET ON THE FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL TAMMEUS  
 c. 1998 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ An orange and brown railroad depot, its
gingerbread architecture revealing its 1870s origin, sits on the
east side of Hiawatha Avenue here, a few minutes southeast of
downtown. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Known to Milwaukee Road station agents as ``The Princess,'' the
old station is a museum now, a symbol of Victorian days when, as
the historical sign next to it says, ``ladies in bustles and
gentlemen in high collars'' got around town by rail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If things go as planned, five years from now modern ladies and
gentlemen (a projected 24,000 a day) will ride past this spot in
sleek new light-rail cars that will run the dozen or so miles
between downtown and a little south of the Mall of America in
suburban Bloomington. Along the way this $446 million system
(estimated in 1997 dollars) will have stops for the Metrodome
sports stadium, the University of Minnesota, several residential
areas, a VA hospital, Fort Snelling and the international airport. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Twin Cities' 22 new light-rail cars will be a small but
crucial part of an improved transit system that will continue to
rely heavily on buses, including some running in dedicated
``busways'' on highways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But light rail clearly represents what Curt Johnson, once an
opponent of this mode of transit but now a supporter and a major
figure in getting it going here, calls a ``breakout strategy, some
way to raise the stakes, some way to lift transit to a different
level in the mind of the public.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   This leap of faith to light rail, says Peter McLaughlin, a
Hennepin County government official through whose district the new
cars will run, ``is about changing the image of a major public
service.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As other cities think about whether and how light rail can
become part of their transit mix, the lessons to be learned from
the Minneapolis-St. Paul experience are many. But none is clearer
than this: Committing to a new vision of public transit is
incredibly complicated and fraught with countless opportunities for
failure. It requires brave leadership that understands what it's
doing and can hold together a necessary coalition of public and
private interests. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``The politics of major infrastructure investments are
permanently fragile,'' says Johnson, who heads the Metro Council,
the powerful regional governing body that oversees an agency called
Metro Transit, which runs the area bus system and also will operate
the light-rail trains. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The area's journey to having light rail has been a frustrating
milk run, not an express trip. For decades, proponents of light
rail fought with people who argued it was too costly and
inefficient compared with just improving bus service. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We paralyzed each other for 20 years,'' says Johnson. ``We
just continued our automobile dependence and let time pass. We
carried out a nearly ritualistic argument in which rail advocates
would resurrect their best theories about what rail would do for
our transportation abilities and our culture. Skeptics, including
myself, would trot out our several arguments about efficiency,
about how little impact it would make on congestion numbers, how
much money would disappear into a black hole. . .'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And because the region enjoyed steady economic growth and no
crises, ``we could afford this exquisite little argument among
elites,'' Johnson says. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he says, ``I came to a point where I realized that
impact mattered more than efficiency.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The impact he's talking about is both getting people to think of
public transit as a reasonable alternative to cars and using light
rail as ``a tool for redevelopment'' along the Hiawatha corridor, a
stretch of mostly unattractive small businesses and light industry
along a four-lane street. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What turned Johnson around on this question was political
reality. First, he realized the state legislature and other funding
sources would never provide the large influx of cash needed to
improve the bus system radically. Second, he and Peter McLaughlin
made a political deal. Johnson would support light rail if
McLaughlin would push for additional financing for buses. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, the stars were aligned right for the Twin Cities.
Not only was Hiawatha Avenue, as part of long-planned improvements,
slated for reconstruction, but two Minnesota members of Congress _
Democrats Martin Sabo and Jim Oberstar _ were in key House
positions to help the region get federal funding for light rail if
local leaders could ever get behind one plan. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My argument,'' says McLaughlin, ``was, we're dinking around
with $3 million projects and $1 million projects and we're
squandering this incredible opportunity to raise the level of our
transit system. If we blow this now we're going to be stuck for
another generation.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many regions count on federal help for 80 percent of such
projects. But the Twin Cities is committed to paying about 50
percent. And federal funding, though not finally assured for the
$200-plus million needed, is now reasonably well lined up. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A big part of that success falls to McLaughlin for his efforts
to get the seven counties in the metro area to agree on the
Hiawatha corridor as the first priority for light rail _ or, if
money for light rail could not be found, for busways. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything like this takes one or more champions,'' says
Johnson. ``Peter put this at the center of his work.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Several other transit corridors are on the drawing board now,
and there is some contention over which one will get to be second
and third. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Gary Erickson, director of Hennepin County's Department
of Transit and Community Works, says he's ``very concerned that the
fight over who's No. 2 could jeopardize the one they're all
behind.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But so far what Johnson calls a permanently fragile coalition is
holding. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Another threat to transit progress here is the odd manner of
funding it. In addition to bus fares and state and federal
contributions, the region pays for transit with local property
taxes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Dependence on the property tax,'' says McLaughlin, ``is a
huge, huge problem.'' That system, says Johnson, ``desperately
needs to be changed'' because it's ``a guarantee of on-going
political arguments about fairness.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Twin Cities' commitment to light rail, for all its fits
and starts, appears now to be well thought-out and reasonable, even
though many headaches may lie ahead in the inevitably difficult
details. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Successful transit systems,'' says Art Leahy, general manager
of Metro Transit, ``have used rail to improve the entire transit
system.'' Clearly that's the plan here, along with economic
redevelopment where the rail line will run. Area leaders have
decided to risk higher initial costs to achieve a long-term impact.
It's the kind of calculated bet on the future an area can make when
it has thoughtful, confident leadership with shared vision. &QL;

 c. 1997 KANSAS CITY STAR 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ST. PAUL _ Twin Cities officials are about a year away from
letting a contract for design and construction of a 12-plus mile
light-rail system from downtown Minneapolis to the airport to the
Mall of America and beyond _ all operated by an agency of the
regional governing body, the Metro Council, headquartered here. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Construction could begin six to eight months after that, with
the line opening in the summer of 2003. Though no two regions are
exactly alike, here are some lessons other cities can learn from
the Twin Cities' experience: &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Creating a light-rail system can be agonizingly slow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``These things take a long time _ six to 10 years to get the
first piece done.'' _ Gary Erickson, director of Hennepin County's
Department of Transit and Community Works. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``None of these solutions will be quick and painless.'' _ state
Rep. Myron Orfield, a land-use planning advocate. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Forget light rail unless it's an integrated part of a sensibly
balanced regional transit system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't just look at kind of a hot alignment that seems to be
the thing you can get people rallying around initially because
sooner or later you're going to have the detractors to that
alignment that, if you really didn't think it through, could find
the fatal flaw that's just going to knock it out of the water.'' _
Erickson &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision here is to have a whole interlocking network of
transit ways all over this region.'' It will include light rail,
commuter rail, regular bus routes and dedicated busways on
highways. _ Curt Johnson, Metro Council chairman. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to recognize that (light rail) is only a piece, and if
it's wildly successful it won't serve but 10 to 15 percent of our
ridership.'' _ Stephen L. Morris, director of transit development
for Metro Transit, the Metro Council agency that operates the bus
system and that will run light rail. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Create a unified regional system that's easy for riders to
use. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You want a seamless system. We're going to have free transfers
from buses to rail and rail to buses. We're going to have a bus
feeder system run by Metro Transit timed to lead to trains as
they're going down Hiawatha Avenue.'' _ Peter McLaughlin, Hennepin
County commissioner and chairman of the Metropolitan Light Rail
Transit Joint Powers Board. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Light rail won't solve all transportation problems but without
it the future may be limited. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Transit is not going to prevent or cure congestion. There's no
illusion about that. But having a serious transit infrastructure
could eventually give (the residents of) this region choices.'' _
Johnson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to have a 24-hour city, you need transit. You
can't build the appropriate density without the commitment to
transit.'' _ John DeWitt, head of ``Transit for Livable
Communities,'' a community-based advocacy group. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Listen to opponents. (Among those historically asking hard
questions about light rail in the Twin Cities have been the
editorial boards of the Star-Tribune in Minneapolis and the Pioneer
Press in St. Paul.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You're always going to have naysayers. They are good in the
process. They can bring out things that you might otherwise not
think about.'' _ Erickson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Focusing on light rail doesn't mean you can ignore the rest of
public transit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``You establish rail as a flagship. But you should not allow
under any circumstances the bus system to become second class.'' _
Art Leahy, general manager of Metro Transit. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Understand the fundamental characteristics of different
transit modes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Rail is powerful but fragile. Buses are very durable.'' _
Leahy, who points out that because light rail, which can haul large
numbers of people quickly, runs on fixed tracks, the whole system
can get stopped when one overhead electrical power line comes down
or another rail car stalls on those tracks. Buses, which carry
fewer people, nonetheless are flexible and can go around trouble. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ The devil is deeply embedded in the details. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Hire management staff with real rail experience.'' _ Leahy,
who is doing that now and who notes that it takes months of
rigorous training for drivers, maintenance workers and other
employees to learn how to run light rail properly and to prepare
for every emergency from suicides on the tracks to electrical
storms that cut power to the system. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   _ Leaders should lead, and not wait too long to imagine the
future. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Majority politics will not demand action on the transportation
front until most people find congestion unspeakable. By the time
most people do, it's too late to do anything about it. So you have
to have people running the risks up front, of saying we've got to
begin to build this infrastructure.'' _ Johnson. &QL;

(1973) and ``Britannia Hospital'' (1982) is 55 now. Silver haired,
slim, just right to step into the white shoes of ``Fantasy
Island'''s Mr. Roarke. The show debuts on ABC Sept. 26.
 &HT;    Remember Roarke (Ricardo Montalban) in the l978-l984 series
welcoming guests to his tropical island with his sidekick Tattoo
(Herve Villechaize)?
 &HT;    Well they're reviving the concept but with a few differences,
starting with Roarke. When McDowell's Roarke is getting dressed,
riffling through a wardrobe full of white suits, he selects the
only black one. This is not the smiling, charming, benevolent
Montalban version anymore.
 &HT;    ``He's much darker and edgier,'' grins McDowell, ``not
saccharine, not pontificating.''
 &HT;    McDowell says his first reaction to stepping onto the new island
was one of horror and he had to be persuaded to look at a script.
``I took the part because it was dark. I liked the producer's sort
of 'Men in Black' approach to it.''
 &HT;    Travelers to this ``Fantasy Island'' will first pass through a
mysterious travel agency run by a couple of veteran actors _
``Picket Fences''' Fyvush Finkel and movie great Sylvia Sydney.
Then on to the island where their fantasies will be fulfilled
though they may not always like it.
 &HT;    The old Roarke made sure his guests had a pleasant time.
McDowell's Roarke believes firmly in the old saying: ``Be careful
what you wish for _ you may get it.''
 &HT;    He's attended by a strange concierge and a bellhop played by
Louis Lombardi (``Natural Born Killers'') and ``Frasier'''s Edward
Hibbert, both of whom keep dropping clues that they are on the
island to pay for their sins. Their female colleague Ariel played
by ``Twin Peak'''s Madchen Amick can morph into any female form to
fulfill any fantasy.
 &HT;    Is the island really the afterlife, as some think?
 &HT;    ``We're all dead, yeah,'' laughs McDowell collapsing in an easy
chair in a bungalow suite at in the Pasadena Ritz. ``But they make
the afterlife seem quite palatable, with these gorgeous babes
coming out of the water waving at the camera.''
 &HT;    But do Roarke and his crew inhabit heaven or hell? ``When I show
it to friends in Europe,'' says McDowell, ``they see Roarke as God.
When I show it to Americans they think he's the Devil. What do you
think that says about the two cultures?''
 &HT;    Married to his third wife Kelly, McDowell has two teenage
children from his marriage to Mary Steenburgen, now Mrs. Ted
Danson. He lives in homes in Los Angeles, the Ojai Valley (50 miles
north of L.A.) and in Tuscany.
 &HT;    A slightly sinister air is notably absent in person but has
served him well in his long career. He's made over 70 movies, some
of them among the greatest British movies ever made. And he's been
kept busier than most of the screen's nice guys.
 &HT;    Just by casting him as Roarke the producers are sending a
message about the kind of show this will be. ``Of course this
Roarke is malevolent,'' says McDowell, ``There are no boundaries
and so many layers to him. Somewhere there is a glimmer of
something, but God knows how deep or locked away it is. He is
all-knowing, all-seeing. He is this Machiavellian character.''
 &HT;    The original ``Fantasy Island'' was made cheaply in and around
Los Angeles, but this one is first cabin all the way. The pilot was
shot on three Hawaiian Islands. Not a bad place to go to work every
day.
 &HT;    And if McDowell ever gets to fulfill his own fantasy, the actor
has one all lined up and ready to fly:
 &HT;    ``When I was in my early teens, I lived near a race track in
England. And they had the British Grand Prix. My heroes were
drivers like Stirling Moss and Mike Hawthorne. So my fantasy would
be to be in a 1950s race car in a race with those great champions
and beat them.''

WHAT IS ACADEMIA FOR? The oldest and most widespread view of
academics is that they are really a bit odd. Mastery of the details

pizza. But if the heroic age of scholarship is past, what are the
humanities for? To teach us how to lead better lives? By Alain de

STARR REPORT VIOLATES `HARMFUL TO MINORS' LEGISLATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 (EDITOR'S NOTE: Charles Levendosky, editorial page editor of the
Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune, has a national reputation for First
Amendment commentary. His e-mail address is

 By CHARLES LEVENDOSKY   
 c. 1998 Casper (Wyo.) Star-Tribune   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Sept. 17, Republican members of the U.S. House began fiddling
around with another version of the unconstitutional Communications
Decency Act _ call it ``Son of CDA.'' The bill (HR 3783) would make
it illegal to post material that is ``harmful to minors'' on the
Internet. The legislators didn't seem to notice their
inconsistency: Only days before, these same House GOP members voted
to put Special Prosecutor Kenneth Starr's graphic sex report on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   A person who violates ``Son of CDA'' can be fined $50,000 and
spend six months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Any Web site that carries advertising or charges for access is
subject to this law. Most online newspapers carry advertising, as
do a vast number of other Web pages. Many of the Web sites that
posted the Starr report carry advertising. A few specialized sites
charge for access.
</P>
<P>
   According to HR 3783, ``The term `material that is harmful to
minors' means any communication, picture, image, graphic image
file, article, recording, writing, or other matter of any kind that
(ii) depicts, describes, or represents, in a patently offensive way
with respect to what is suitable for minors, an actual or simulated
sexual act or sexual contact, actual or simulated normal or
perverted sexual acts, or a lewd exhibition of the genitals ...''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's sex report certainly fits that definition. If ``Son of
CDA'' were already the law, members of the U.S. House who voted for
posting the report on the Internet could be brought up on charges
of trafficking in material that is harmful to minors.
</P>
<P>
   The members of the House reflect America's hypocritical notions
about sex _ my sexual behavior is right and good, yours is
perverse.
</P>
<P>
   According to the bill, it depends upon who is putting the
material on the World Wide Web and for what reason. HR 3783
contains an exception: The material isn't considered harmful if _
it has political value for minors.
</P>
<P>
   So if 10-year-old Jane clicks on the Starr report, obviously its
political value far outweighs its sleazy obsession with sex.
</P>
<P>
   Would an ordinary citizen be immune to prosecution if he were to
post snapshots and descriptions of Rep. Helen Chenoweth, R-Idaho,
in her former adulterous relationship? Or details of the affair
involving Republican Rep. Dan Burton of Indiana? Or motel photos of
Illinois Republican Rep. Henry Hyde and his ``friend'' during their
four-year liaison? Would the political value outweigh the sleaze?
</P>
<P>
   Barry Steinhardt, president of the Electronic Frontier
Foundation, is quoted in a Sept. 17 email release stating that the
Starr report ``has been blocked by most filtering programs and that
several Internet service providers have ordered their users to take
down mirror sites of the report.'' Steinhardt argues that although
the Starr report is important, the fact that it is being blocked by
filtering software programs indicates that it ``would not pass the
legislation's `harmful to minors' test.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, the Starr report with its lascivious details should
doom any sweeping legislation aimed at prohibiting sexual speech on
the Internet. Congress can't have it both ways. If Congress is
allowed to post patently offensive sexual materials, so is the
ordinary citizen.
</P>
<P>
   HR 3783 would criminalize speech that is protected by the First
Amendment. It has the same problem that the Communications Decency
Act did. Most Web sites are accessible to anyone on the Internet
without a charge and without age verification necessary.
</P>
<P>
   The technology for verifying the age of someone who wants to
access a Web site is extraordinarily expensive. If the Internet
were limited to only those sites which could afford verifying
technology, most of the best sites on the World Wide Web would
disappear.
</P>
<P>
   In Reno vs. ACLU, a unanimous U.S. Supreme Court struck CDA down
as unconstitutional because it prohibited the protected speech of
adults.
</P>
<P>
   The court said that the government cannot require speakers on
the Internet to distinguish between adults and minors.
</P>
<P>
   HR 3783 will fail for the same reasons that CDA did.
</P>
<P>
   If Congress passes this law, it will cost civil liberties
organizations more than $1 million to challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Michael Oxley, R-Ohio, and the bill's 58 other co-sponsors
should have to repay these legal costs out of their own pockets.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that would drive the Supreme Court's decision home: The
government cannot limit adult speech to that of a child's _ anymore
than Starr could have written his report on Clinton at a child's
level of language and understanding.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   My son, Howard, and daughter Annie live and move and have their
beings in that windowless, clockless pleasure dome known as Las
Vegas. I'm pleased to report that in May, in a packed room at
Binion's Horseshoe Casino in downtown Vegas, they placed sixth and
seventh in the seven-card stud competition, the only sibling pair
ever to reach the finals in the World Series of Poker in the same
game.
</P>
<P>
   Annie and Howard have also won national tournaments with exotic
names like the Diamond Jim Brady Texas Hold 'Em Shootout and the
Hall of Fame Classic Deuce-to-Seven Lowball Draw No-Limit. If you
can't already tell, I'm proud of my kids, especially because they
possess such passion for what they do.
</P>
<P>
   My children's achievements in the gaming halls inspire me to
play with a full deck of vivid words and phrases that have made the
trip from the poker table into our everyday conversation and
writing. The same color and high-risk excitement of poker that
inspired 352 players to plunk down $10,000 each in the 1998 world
championship event at Binion's have made the language of poker one
of the most pervasive metaphors in our language.
</P>
<P>
   The basic elements of poker are the cards, the chips and the
play of the hand.
</P>
<P>
   From the game of five-card stud descends the expression
 &UR; back-to-back victories &LR; , from a fortuitous ace-down-ace-up as the
first two cards. Be on guard for a cardsharp who will give you a
fast shuffle, in which case you may get lost in the shuffle. You
might call such a low-down skunk  &UR; a four-flusher &LR;  _ a poker player
who pretends to hold a flush (from the Latin  &UR; fluxus &LR; , because all
five cards flow together), but in fact holds a worthless hand of
four same-suit cards and one that doesn't match.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we've laid our cards on the table, let's see what
happens when the chips are down. We call a gilt-edged, sure-thing
stock a  &UR; blue-chip &LR;  security because blue poker chips are the most
valuable.
</P>
<P>
   When we compare the worth and power of two things, we often ask
how one  &UR; stacks up &LR;  against the other, as in ``How do the Knicks
 &UR; stack up &LR;  against the Heat?'' Here, the reference is to the
columns of chips piled up before the players around a poker table.
These stacks also account for the expressions  &UR; bottom dollar &LR;  and
 &UR; top dollar &LR; . Betting your  &UR; bottom dollar &LR;  means wagering the
entire stack, and the  &UR; top dollar &LR; , or chip, is the one that sits
atop the highest pile on the table. Indeed, the metaphor of poker
chips is so powerful that one of the euphemisms we use for death is
 &UR; cashing in one's chips &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The guts of poker is the betting. If you want to call my bluff
on that one, and insist that I put up or shut up, I'll be happy to
put my money where my mouth is.
</P>
<P>
   Say you're involved in a big business deal. You let the other
guy know that you're not a piker running a penny-ante operation.
One theory traces  &UR; piker &LR;  to westward migrants from Pike County,
Mo. These small farmers were less inclined than hardened veterans
to risk high stakes, and the county name came eponymously to
designate penny pinchers.  &UR; Ante &LR; , from the Latin for ``before,''
refers to chips placed in the middle of the poker table before the
betting begins, so a  &UR; penny-ante &LR;  game is fit only for  &UR; pikers &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   The negotiations continue, and you sweeten the pot by upping the
stakes. You don't want to blow your wad and go in the hole, but you
don't want to stand pat either. Rather than passing the buck, you
play it close to the vest without showing your hand, maintain your
poker face, keep everything aboveboard, and hope to hit the
jackpot.
</P>
<P>
   The hole in the phrase  &UR; in the hole &LR;  refers to a slot cut in the
middle of poker tables through which checks and cash are deposited
into a box, to be transferred later to the coffers of the house.
 &UR; Stand pat &LR;  refers to the strategy of keeping one's original
( &UR; pat &LR; ) hand in draw poker rather than making an exchange. Because
cardsharps are known to engage in chicanery when their hands are
under the table, or board,  &UR; aboveboard &LR;  has come to mean open
honesty, and  &UR; under the table &LR;  deception.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jackpot &LR;  originally described the reward to the big winner in a
game of progressive poker, in which you need a pair of jacks or
better to ``open the pot.'' Because the stakes grow larger until
the requisite pair is dealt,  &UR; jackpot &LR;  has expanded to include the
pots of gold in slot machines, game shows and state lotteries.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Pass the buck &LR;  is a common expression that means ``to shift
responsibility.'' But why, you may have asked yourself, should
handing someone a dollar bill indicate that responsibility is in
any way transferred? Once again the answer can be found in
high-stakes gaming halls and riverboats. The buck in  &UR; pass the
buck &LR;  was originally a poker term designating a marker that was
placed in front of the player whose turn it was to deal the next
hand.
</P>
<P>
   This movable object varied the order of betting and kept one
person from dealing all the time, thus transferring the
disadvantages of being the first to wager and cutting down on the
chances of cheating. During the heyday of poker in the 19th
century, the marker was often a hunting knife whose handle was made
of a buck's horn. The marker defined the game as Buckhorn Poker or
Buck Poker and gave us  &UR; pass the buck &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   In the Old West, silver dollars often replaced buckhorn knives
as tokens, and these coins took on the slang name  &UR; buck &LR;  for their
own. President Harry Truman adopted the still-famous motto ``The
buck stops here,'' meaning that the ultimate responsibility rested
with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The cleverest application of poker terminology that I have ever
encountered appears on the truck of a New Hampshire plumbing
company: ``A Flush Is Better Than a Full House.'' In poker that
isn't true, but any homeowner recognizes its wisdom.
</P>
<P>
   Great poker players must have a firm grounding in the statistics
of card distribution and probability but, as my son and daughter
the poker champions explain, ``To play poker at the highest level
is to read people _ their faces, their body language and their
behavior patterns.'' Language and people are inextricably
intertwined. The democratic poetry of poker that pervades our
American language is a vivid emblem of the games that we, as a
civilization, watch and play.
</P>
<P>
   It's in the cards. You can bet on it.

(DUPLICATION WARNING: also sent with `i' code) 
(bl) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ Although the world has focused its attention on the
one-sided battle between the Chinese Communist government and the
political dissidents who press for radical change, there is also a
large population here of intellectuals, many of them scholars or
former officials, who work openly to nudge the system in a more
democratic direction.
</P>
<P>
   These people, known as liberals, borrow a term from pingpong to
describe their strategy for stretching the bounds of political
debate. They speak of hitting a ``touch-ball'' _ one that just
grazes the edge of the table. A risky hit, yet one that scores.
</P>
<P>
   In this metaphor, the ping-pong table stands for the
ideologically correct thoughts of the moment. Impatient
progressives, as they write and speak, try to incorporate as much
of the day's official jargon and ideas as they believe, or can
stomach, while probing as far as they dare on issues like free
speech, rule of law and political pluralism.
</P>
<P>
   One problem is that the size of the table is constantly
changing, and such people spend enormous amounts of time monitoring
official talk and watching the experience of colleagues to figure
out just where the limits are at any moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you hit it just right, then you can get away with saying
something new or provocative,'' said a Beijing law professor. ``If
you miss the table, you lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Lose'' might mean anything from a reprimand at work to forced
retirement, with a de facto ban on publication. Or the writer could
descend into the ranks of the ``dissidents,'' who are harassed and
detained by police.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the liberal scholars and officials are not to
be confused with the beleaguered democracy dissidents, who push
more directly, persistently and actively for radical change. The
liberals hope instead that their more academic discourse will plant
the seeds of a more open system.
</P>
<P>
   Because every camp, from Communist leaders to dissidents, uses
terms like democracy and the rule of law, it can be hard to tell
who really stands for what.
</P>
<P>
   But in China, where ideas drove a revolution and words can bring
jail, people are exquisitely attuned to linguistic cues. What might
seem verbal hairsplitting in America is taken here with utmost
seriousness.
</P>
<P>
   In today's parlance, for example, the need for ``political
structural reform'' is voiced by Communist leaders, starting with
the president and Communist Party chief, Jiang Zemin. This seems to
mean things like improving government efficiency, ending corruption
and better enforcing party-dictated laws.
</P>
<P>
   Those with more Western notions of democracy often leave out the
word ``structural,'' and talk of ``political reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The party's definition of democracy seems, again, to focus on
improving ``oversight'' and ``supervision'' of bureaucrats, to make
sure they honestly carry out Beijing's edicts. (Genuine direct
elections are limited to administrative jobs in villages.)
</P>
<P>
   Thus at the Communist Party Congress last fall, Jiang could
declare, according to the official English translation, ``We should
promote democracy, improve the legal system and build a socialist
country ruled by law,'' even as he reaffirmed the Four Cardinal
Principles that the late Deng Xiaoping issued in 1979: keeping to
the socialist road, upholding the dictatorship of the proletariat,
upholding the leadership of the Communist Party and upholding
Marxism-Leninism and Mao Tse-tung Thought.
</P>
<P>
   Jiang's reference to a ``country ruled by law'' in that speech
last fall caused no end of analysis among the cognoscenti, because
of the particular Chinese characters used in the official
transcript.
</P>
<P>
   Communist leaders, and emperors before them, had long used one
term to call for what is often translated as ``rule by law'' or ``a
strengthening of the legal system.'' This term is taken to mean
improving the use of law and institutional channels to carry out
party rule _ an improvement over the highly personal rule of the
past, but hardly Western democracy.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, liberals have used another term _ which sounds
the same in spoken Mandarin but is written with a different
character; this one is often translated as ``rule of law,'' meaning
that the entire nation, including the party, is governed under the
law.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent essay, Li Shenzhi _ a former vice president of the
Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who was sacked for not
supporting the 1989 crackdown on student demonstrations _ writes
that there is a big difference: Under ``rule of law,'' he says,
``no one is above the law or exempted by it.'' Not even a party
chief.
</P>
<P>
   So heads turned when the official written Chinese version of
Jiang's speech used that second formulation. Was Jiang floating a
serious change in attitude? Or was his speechwriter merely toying
with the country's intellectuals?
</P>
<P>
   Li's essay appears in a recent book, ``Political China: Facing
the Era of Choosing a New Structure'' (China Today Publishing
House), in which Li shows himself to be an aggressive touch-ball
player. At one point, he writes that China ``should quickly adopt
the common concept of the world: `Human rights are civil rights.'''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The book, which includes articles by scholars and former
officials, exemplifies the touch-ball approach. The clear intent is
to foster discussion of serious change.
</P>
<P>
   Yet facing the title page is an artfully selected quotation from
Deng, whose vaguest utterances, now elevated to the level of
theory, are used by Jiang to legitimize his program. The quote
reads, ``If you only carry out economic system reform and not
political system reform, then economic system reform will not
work.'' It continues, ``Whether all of our reforms ultimately
succeed is dependent on political system reform.''
</P>
<P>
   The apparent homage may signal that the book is not intended to
challenge the system brazenly in the manner of an impudent
dissident like the exiled Wei Jingsheng.
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the book ever include words like ``multiparty
politics'' or ``direct election of national leaders.'' Aiming that
far off the table would have guaranteed that the book would be
banned.
</P>
<P>
   The book prudently includes a spectrum of views, including an
essay by a close adviser to President Jiang, Wang Huning. He calls
for ``political structural reform'' in order to build a ``socialist
political system with Chinese characteristics'' _ under the party's
leadership. That, of course, lands well in the middle of the
ping-pong table.
</P>
<P>
   A spray of touch-balls, in contrast, comes from Liu Junning, a
political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences who
prefers exploring ``liberal democracy'' to ``people's democracy.''
In one essay, ``The Market Economy and Limited government,'' he
writes, ``Individual property rights and a free market economy will
not automatically lead to democracy, but without property rights
and markets, it's absolutely impossible to have democracy.'' He
also writes, ``Guaranteeing property rights not only needs
democracy, it also needs constitutional government and rule of
law.''
</P>
<P>
   But many liberals find it puzzling and frightening that the
authorities recently arrested one of the two journalists who were
the book's editors. Shi Binhai, a senior editor of The China
Economic Times, was detained Sept. 5 by state security agents who
gave his family no reason. Shi's associates say they do not believe
his involvement with the book, which continues to sell in Chinese
bookstores, was the reason. Apparently it was through some other,
undisclosed, activity that Shi missed the edge of the table.

PENTAGON PLANNERS GIVE NEW MEANING TO `OVER THE TOP' 
</HEADLINE>
  (The Week in Review) 
(NOTE TO INTERNATIONAL CLIENTS: For international clients' use by

Horwitz in Paris for details and prices (Phone: 47 42 17 11; FAX:

(bl) 
 By JAMES RISEN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was a military plan of staggering dimensions,
designed by the Pentagon to be so over-the-top that it would never
gain the approval of the president of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the Reagan White House in 1985, mounting evidence of
Libya's support for anti-American terrorism had created something
akin to panic, and calls went out for dramatic action.
</P>
<P>
   So planners in the Pentagon went into overdrive to offer the
Middle Eastern equivalent of the Normandy invasion. The military
told the National Security Council it would require a ground
invasion by at least a couple of Army divisions, with support from
several of the Navy's prized carrier battle groups _ and an
alliance with the Egyptian military thrown in for good measure.
</P>
<P>
   The 1985 invasion of Libya would now be in the lesson plans of
every high school history teacher in America if it had actually
taken place. Instead, the stillborn invasion is a classic example
of Washington's propensity to gin up contingency plans for
seemingly otherworldly operations that never get the green light.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there is a permanent infrastructure in the U.S. national
security apparatus that does nothing but plan for every conceivable
crisis, often with little or no hope that the plans will be taken
seriously by senior policy-makers or the president.
</P>
<P>
   So when the CIA and the Pentagon considered a high-risk raid
into Afghanistan to capture Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
believed to be the mastermind behind the U.S. Embassy bombings in
Kenya and Tanzania on Aug. 7, their planning efforts hardly
represented a rogue operation by cowboys in the Pentagon's
basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of the problems you face are really hard, and sometimes
people stretch to figure out how to solve them,'' observed a former
director of Central Intelligence, Robert Gates.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, whether such radical plans ever get the green light
depends on the grim calculus of risk versus reward _ the possible
cost in U.S. soldiers' lives versus the opportunity to take out a
terrorist bent on killing American civilians. Above all, it depends
on the will of the president.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the scheme to abduct bin Laden, the plan never
even reached President Clinton. Instead, it was shelved by the
director of Central Intelligence, George Tenet, and other senior
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Few presidents have been willing to accept the risks of giving
the go-ahead to acts of derring-do by U.S. commandos except in
times of war or when other options have been exhausted. Indeed, the
specter of past failures, from the botched 1980 mission to rescue
the hostages in Iran to the bloody 1993 ambush of U.S. Army Rangers
on a mission to capture a local warlord in Somalia, haunt the
planners of new covert missions and the policy-makers who consider
them.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in almost every international crisis, a wide array of
contingency plans _ including the kind of aggressive military
actions that would startle the public if it were known they were
under discussion _ are roughed out by military and intelligence
planners. Sometimes, the planning is done simply to sketch out all
options for the president and his senior advisers, and to highlight
the possible consequences of aggressive action.
</P>
<P>
   Often, the plans are so out of the range of possibility that
they are not even presented to senior policy makers, let alone the
president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes people will say this is a great plan, but we're not
even going to run it up the flagpole,'' said one former senior
intelligence official.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about the inter-agency process is that it
imposes a reality test on these plans,'' added Gates. ``We used to
call it the laugh test _ can you present this at the NSC without
people giggling?'' (To be sure, some still slip past even that test
at the National Security Council; otherwise the world would never
have heard of Iran-Contra.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, the United States has developed a sizable, largely secret
infrastructure to plan and train for such contingencies, just in
case. Today, the planning often relates to the global battle
against terrorism, and involves proposed covert actions against
terrorist organizations and their leaders like bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since the Persian Gulf war, when military commanders and
CIA officials became convinced of the need for closer coordination
between their services, planning for covert missions has been
conducted jointly. Today, training and planning for such operations
often involves the Joint Special Operations Command, which includes
elite commando units like the Delta Force and the Navy's SEAL Team
Six, working closely with the Military and Special Programs
Division inside the CIA's Directorate of Operations, the agency's
clandestine espionage arm.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI and Justice Department are also intimately involved in
planning and assessing missions designed to capture individual
terrorists and bring them back to the United States to face
criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   But the U.S. military doctrine calling for the use of
overwhelming force to minimize U.S. casualties and the demands for
nearly perfect intelligence about the target heavily influence such
planning. They tend to guarantee that most proposed covert missions
never get off the drawing boards.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, for instance, the CIA and the military planned a raid
to capture the Bosnian Serb leader and indicted war criminal
Radovan Karadzic, but the plan was never approved in part because
of the fear of casualties.
</P>
<P>
   ``The military tends to present contingency plans that involve
significant U.S. forces to minimize casualties and end operations
quickly,'' Gates said. ``To civilian leaders, that would seem like
more than is needed, but very few civilian leaders are willing to
go ahead with an operation with less force than the military says
is needed. A civilian would take a very high risk if he directed
the military to undertake an operation with less.''
</P>
<P>
   Les Aspin learned that lesson when he was defense secretary,
after the costly raid in Somalia; he was criticized for having
failed to provide adequate armor support for the U.S. troops in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The extravagant planning also serves as a ``gut check'' for the
civilians, Gates argues. ``It's a test that allows the military to
ask: `Are they serious about wanting this? Or are they just playing
political games?'''

   But I'm afraid it's not for us. ``Referral,'' while an ambitious
first effort, simply does not meet the standards we like to
maintain here at Soaring Stallion Press.
</P>
<P>
   First, it needs editing. It is simply not sexy to describe the
same sex act three times, and then follow with five footnotes about
said act. We get the idea the first time.
</P>
<P>
   Actually our senior editor, Jane V.V. Voom, who specializes in
serial-killer romance mysteries, found your constant reiteration of
the same facts ``disturbing and possibly pathological.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, that's just typical Jane! But your repetitions do
destroy the natural rhythms of lust. Sex builds. It arcs. It
climaxes. It is supposed to be fun. You make it sound a bit like
homework.
</P>
<P>
   And so unpleasantly tawdry! During an initial courtship scene,
your Monica character flashes her lingerie: ``In the course of
flirting with him, she raised her jacket in the back and showed him
the straps of her thong underwear, which extended above her
pants.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, we have absolutely nothing against thong underwear. In our
recent best-seller, ``The Golddiggers of Grenada,'' Letitia
Lawrence wears a thong dotted with miniature tropical drinks. Of
course, a good heroine should wear a thong _ but not until much
later!
</P>
<P>
   We would prefer a ``meet cute'' scenario. If she must work in
his office, perhaps one could knock over a filing cabinet onto the
other? Something sudden and less obvious. Have you read our
top-selling title, ``The Empty Duplex''? In this wonderful novel,
Federica and Bartholomew meet when they discover they have the same
real estate agent. We aren't introduced to Federica's thong until
page 300. And Bartholomew finds it even later.
</P>
<P>
   Believe us, if you begin with a thong, you have nowhere to go.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the point, Ken: We want somewhere to go. We crave
emotional depths from your characters. We want to believe that
Bill, like Bartholomew, would give up a whole semiconductor empire
for the right girl. Wars come and go, the real estate market
crashes, landlords renege, but passion always triumphs.
</P>
<P>
   Think about that when you rewrite moments like this one:
``[They) briefly discussed an antique book that she had dropped
off. . . . With the book, she enclosed a letter telling the
President that she wanted to have sexual intercourse with him at
least once.''
</P>
<P>
   Ken, that's cold! Remember, always show, don't tell. Give us an
inkling of inner life. And for God's sake don't make the woman
plead for sex in a letter; it's undignified. If your characters are
going to resist complete consummation _ a choice I should tell you
does lower your chances of getting published _ at least they should
feel a few pangs of desire.
</P>
<P>
   How about this instead:
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   The leather bindings cracked beneath his fingers. A first
edition, never read, flown in from a Beverly Hills dealer. He was
no fool. He knew how much such a book would cost. And his office
hadn't even paid her a salary. Thank God she came from money. She
would never need to sell the rights to their story. She would
always buy him thoughtful gifts that neither of them would have the
time to read or fully absorb. He leafed through the yellowing
pages. There was a letter inside, sealed with wax. He looked up.
``I don't care what this letter says, Monica,'' he told her. ``I
must have you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now,'' he said firmly. ``And if not now, eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   We want a hero who doesn't need to read directions or take
polls. We want a heroine who follows her gut. But you give us a
hero who worries about what the world will think and a heroine who
worries about what the hero will think. (Meanwhile, given the close
proximity of Betty the secretary, the reader is distracted with
thoughts of what she must think.)
</P>
<P>
   We want  &UR; passionate &LR;  thoughts, cloaked in  &UR; passionate  &LR; 
language. Although we have been editing risque works of fiction for
years, your lurid yet clinical style upset everyone here
enormously. You tally and clock events as if each encounter were
not unique and timeless. You state there are ``nine incidents''
involving ``breasts.'' Why not just say: ``She held him to her
cleavage again. And again . . .''?
</P>
<P>
   I wonder too: Can't she hold him to her cleavage in a more
rapturous setting? Why set every scene in that irritating office
with all those interruptions? He is powerful. She is rich. You
would think they could get a hotel room. A dusky beach at sunset.
Or at least a bed of some kind. Lovers ought to be wrapped in
silken sheets, or in resilient animal rugs or hearth coverings. The
intern character stays on the floor too much, while the president
sits in his chair for long periods, which makes the reader worry
about his bad back.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, your characters are strange. Your hero does not seem to
know what sexual relations are. Your heroine does not seem to
accept that he is the leader of the free world. Instead of jewels
and vows, they exchange a hat pin, a letter opener embellished with
a frog, an Annie Lennox recording and, ultimately, a series of
tacky souvenirs.
</P>
<P>
   In short, they seem completely incapable of having a romantic
affair as we at Soaring Stallion Press define romantic affair. And
we have been in the business of defining it for a long time.
</P>
<P>
   I should warn you that yours is not the kind of fare that would
normally be found in a mainstream bookstore. You may want to try a
softcore porn publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Or perhaps writing is not your vocation after all. Have you
considered law school?

   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) After a long silence, Babe Ruth has emerged
for a rare interview on tonight's ``Larry King Live.''(END ITALICS
HERE)
</P>
<P>
   Larry King: Tonight, a kid so incorrigible his parents threw him
out of the family tavern. Pitcher, slugger, gorger, ladies' man.
George Herman Ruth. The Babe. A great honor to have the
difficult-to-get Babe Ruth in our studio. You've been on our wish
list for years.
</P>
<P>
   Babe Ruth: I figured I had to do this sooner or later. Now I've
got my Playstation Hooters All-Star Babe '99 CD-ROM game to
promote.
</P>
<P>
   King: So many areas to cover. Let's start with Mark McGwire. You
know him?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   King: Great guy, good friend, frequent guest.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: A 6-foot-6 inch weenie. What's he swing, a 34-ounce bat? I
showed him the stick I hit 60 with. Fifty ounces. Big wimp couldn't
lift it. Whined like Ty Cobb when he didn't get invited to my 50th
birthday party at Nathan's.
</P>
<P>
   King: Amazing. Have you talked to Sammy Sosa?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Talk to him? He's wearing my lucky cup from 1927.
</P>
<P>
   King: Babe, you played fat. Why?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: I'm an endomorph, kid. It's my body type. I couldn't help
it. Dr. Dean Ornish helped me learn not to hate myself for it.
</P>
<P>
   King: So it wasn't the hot dogs?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Ah, that was a lot of hype. Sportswriters saw me eat a
dozen dogs between innings and thought that was all I ate. Mostly I
ate baby carrots and soy burgers.
</P>
<P>
   King: Supermodel food but still a porker. Amazing. Lou Gehrig.
You hated him.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Only after his mother made me a sauerbraten with cabbage
that put me in a slump in '31. Couldn't lift a bat or a woman for a
week.
</P>
<P>
   King: Slugging and sweet talk with the one and only Babe Ruth.
We'll be back.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)(Begin video clip: William Bendix in a scene
from ``The Babe Ruth Story.'')(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   King: Lots of critics think that was the worst sports movie
ever.
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Can't disagree. But did you see ``Baseketball''? I had to
hear Bob Costas talk about how hard his nipples were. But I loved
``Happy Gilmore.'' Adam Sandler just kills me.
</P>
<P>
   King: Why has nobody portrayed Babe Ruth well on the silver
screen?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: I thought John Goodman would be great. But talk about
endomorphic! He was 70 pounds too fat playing me when I was 40
pounds overweight. And I'll tell you, I wasn't fat as a kid. But
that movie made me look like a hippo at 15.
</P>
<P>
   King: You were great as you in ``Pride of the Yankees.'' If Babe
Ruth could choose an actor to play Babe Ruth, who would it be?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Pacino. Who else?
</P>
<P>
   King: Great choice. Good friend. Frequent guest. Columbus, Ohio,
you're talking to Babe Ruth.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: Hi, Babe. What do you think is the worst trade ever?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: When that bum Steinbrenner traded Jay Buhner for Ken
Phelps. How could he trade a future superstar for a guy who was out
of baseball in two years?
</P>
<P>
   King: Walla Walla, Washington, hello.
</P>
<P>
   Caller: Babe, I hear you were depressed because nobody asked you
to manage in the majors. But you seem happy now. What's your
secret?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: St. John's Wort. And I read the ``Don't Sweat the Small
Stuff'' books.
</P>
<P>
   King: Let's go back. You grew up in Baltimore. Orphanage life
tough?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Nah, I loved it. Learned baseball there. Played the
recorder in the St. Mary's marching band.
</P>
<P>
   King: You were musically inclined?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Kid, you think all I did was hit home runs? I had a
liberal arts education, short as it was.
</P>
<P>
   King: Did you have any quibbles with the Modern Library's list
of the greatest 100 books ever?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: No Toni Morrison. No Wally Lamb. No Dick Schaap.
</P>
<P>
   King: Me, I'd have voted for Wilt Chamberlain's memoir. Babe,
what do you think _ Yankee Stadium on the West Side?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Kid, I live on the West Side and I don't want it there.
Too much traffic. And a billion dollars? Cripes, I built the first
one for $2.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   King: So you're for keeping it in the Bronx?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: I didn't build it to move it, Larry.
</P>
<P>
   King: You ever meet Rudy Giuliani?
</P>
<P>
   Ruth: Only long enough to sell him a cap with some old sweat on
it for 50 grand. He thought it was mine. It was really Wally
Pipp's.
</P>
<P>
   King: Don't ever be a stranger, buddy. The name is Babe Ruth.
What a mensch. Tomorrow night from Washington, William Bennett and
Little Richard. Good night.

   Familiar Faces Return to Moscow
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, when Mikhail Gorbachev, the last Soviet
president, was tinkering with an ossified Communist economy, he
sought the advice of a group of then-liberal economists who
advocated such notions as a `'regulated market economy.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in a return engagement that Russian headline writers were
calling ``back to the future,'' the same team of economists has
returned, advising Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov about how to put
the brakes on Russia's pell-mell transition to a free market.
</P>
<P>
   Their point man in the government, First Deputy Prime Minister
Yuri Maslyukov, is another familiar face: in 1991, he was last head
of Gosplan, the giant state planning agency that planned the Soviet
economy into the ground.

   A Flash in Time Is Buried in Alabama
</P>
<P>
   People did not throng the streets of Montgomery to see the white
hearse roll slowly by, at least not as many people as might have
been expected. Maybe, some political experts surmised, it was
because George C. Wallace had already passed into history.
</P>
<P>
   The man generations of Alabamians just called ``The Guv'na'' was
buried Wednesday in Montgomery beside his first wife, Lurleen,
after finally giving in to the paralysis and sickness that had
slowly consumed his life. He was 79, and since 1972 _ since Arthur
Bremer fired five bullets into him in a Maryland shopping center _
he had lived in pain, in his wheelchair.
</P>
<P>
   Old friends _ white ones who had always stood by him, black ones
who believed him when he said he was sorry for what he had done to
them as a segregationist, had come to see his body as he lay in
state in the Capitol. Some of them brought their grandchildren, for
one last peek at a man who had personified a hot-flash in time,
only to become what many people came to regard as a tragic figure.
</P>
<P>
   ``God forgave him,'' said John Watkins, a 68-year-old black man,
as eight State Troopers carried the casket from the Capitol.
</P>

   Watkins said he had, too.

   Familiar Names In Minnesota Too
</P>
<P>
   In a race among men with famous Minnesota names, victory in the
Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party's primary for governor went to the
state's most revered one: Hubert H. Humphrey.
</P>
<P>
   In this case, it was Hubert H. Humphrey III, the son and
namesake of the former vice president, senator and 1968
presidential nominee. Also-rans in the primary included Ted
Mondale, the son of former Vice President Walter Mondale; Mike
Freeman, son of former Gov. Orville Freeman; Mark Dayton, heir to
the Dayton Hudson store conglomerate, which owns the Target chain,
and Doug Johnson, who described himself as the only commoner in the
contest but the one with the most authentic Minnesota name.
</P>
<P>
   Humphrey, the state's attorney general, ran a campaign that
boasted of a bringing a lawsuit against tobacco companies that will
net the state $6.1 billion, and vowed to pay two years of college
tuition for Minnesotans.

   Bosnia's Serbs Reject A Leader the West Liked
</P>
<P>
   As Bosnia conducted elections under the watchful eyes of the
United States and other countries with peacekeeping forces in the
land, the West's diplomatic strategy was clear: isolate the
hard-line Serb nationalists and support those moderates who
appeared most likely to support reconciliation of Bosnia's Serbs
and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   That strategy seemed to have been dealt a heavy blow last week
when Biljana Plavsic appeared to have been voted out of office as
President of Bosnia's Serb Republic, according to international
officials monitoring preliminary results. The winner seemed to be
Nikola Poplasen, leader of the Serb Radical Party, who is
considered an extreme nationalist.
</P>
<P>
   From her own offices in Banja Luka, Ms. Plavsic had been
confronting radical Serb leaders in Pale for more than a year, and
a defeat would seem to be a clear repudiation of the West's goals.
```If Poplasen has won, it means the Bosnian Serbs are telling the
West, `We don't care about you or your money or your quaint ideas
about reconciliation with Muslims and Croats,''' a European
diplomat said.

   A Debt Wiped Out For the House Speaker
</P>
<P>
   House Speaker Newt Gingrich wiped out a debt he never incurred.
He said he did not need the $150,000 that former Sen. Bob Dole had
offered him to pay off the $300,000 fine that the House had levied
against the speaker last January.
</P>
<P>
   Friends said that Gingrich had made more money than expected on
his book, ``Lessons Learned the Hard Way,'' even though the tome
made the best-seller list for only one week.
</P>
<P>
   The fine against Gingrich _ to repay the government for the
expense of investigating whether he misled the House ethics
committee _ is now being examined as the model for part of a
possible sanction against President Clinton, who misled many
others.

   The U.N. Nominee Is Put on Hold
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous poison-pen letter has left the United States
waiting for a chief delegate at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   The letter about Richard Holbrooke, President Clinton's nominee
for the post, alleged that the veteran diplomat may have violated
federal ethics laws in his contacts with former colleagues after
leaving the State Department two years ago. It also questioned his
ties to a former ambassador to Switzerland, who gave Holbrooke
rent-free lodging at his home in Washington for more than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke, the architect of the 1995 Dayton peace agreement that
halted the fighting in Bosnia, has denied any wrongdoing and
amended his financial disclosure statements to reflect the gift of
the lodging. The investigation by the Justice and State Departments
is expected to last at least several more weeks.

   Amid the Lost Lives, Also a Loss to Art
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian official who saw the wreckage of Swissair Flight 111
after it crashed into the ocean Sept. 2, killing all 229 people
aboard, said it looked like a pane of glass that had shattered into
a million pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Among those pieces is an original Picasso painting that was
being sent to Geneva and was probably destroyed on impact. In his
later years, Picasso dashed off at least six versions of a painting
called ``The Painter,'' and Swissair has confirmed that one of them
was on Flight 111.
</P>
<P>
   The ill-fated jet also carried a treasure trove of jewelry, cash
and diamonds, including one piece that had been displayed at the
Museum of Natural History until Aug. 30.

hunters to stay away.

   Returning to Normal At Northwest Airlines
</P>
<P>
   Air service slowly began returning to isolated parts of the
upper Midwest and South last week after pilots at Northwest
Airlines ratified a new contract, ending their bitter 15-day strike
against the nation's fourth-largest airline. About one quarter of
Northwest's 1,700 daily passenger flights resumed on Wednesday; the
airline said its full schedule would not be back in the air until
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But Northwest's labor troubles are far from over.

   A New Way to Read The Law at Home
</P>
<P>
   Beginning next month, students will be able to earn a law degree
entirely online.
</P>
<P>
   Kaplan Educational Centers, a Washington Post Co. subsidiary
best known for its test-coaching services, is opening the Concord
University School of Law, in which students will take all of their
courses over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The school will not be accredited by the American Bar
Association, however, and as a result graduates will face some
limits to where they can practice law. California is one state that
will welcome them.
</P>
<P>
   The school, which began accepting applications last week
(www.concord.kaplan.edu), expects to attract people whose careers,
family obligations or geographic locations make it hard for them to
attend traditional law schools.
</P>
<P>
   The cost, $4,200 a year for a four-year law degree program, will
be far below the cost at most private universities and even less
than at many public ones.

   Welcome, Friend. Wanna Bet? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In a brilliantly cynical venture, the Palestinian Authority
unveiled last week the first large, for-profit international
investment in Yasser Arafat's territory: a casino catering to
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   The Oasis Casino outside Jericho is a $50 million,
Austrian-backed project intended to milk Israelis of their money in
order to generate millions in tax revenues for the cash-strapped
Palestinian Authority.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians are barred from entering the glitzy new building by
Arafat, who bowed to the protests of Islamic fundamentalists. Half
of its employees, though, are Palestinians, somewhat sheepishly
working in a house of sin in order to double the salaries they
could have if there were work available as laborers.
</P>

   Arafat did not attend opening ceremonies. Neither did the
promised guest of honor: the model Claudia Schiffer.

   Italian Not Spoken Here &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It looked as if in Italy, at least, Private Ryan would not be
saved. A two-month strike by dubbers delayed the release in Italy
of more than a dozen major films, including Steven Spielberg's
latest hit movie.
</P>
<P>
   Italians, far more than the French or Germans, watch television
and go the the movies expecting to hear John Wayne and Jim Carrey
speak the native language. In Italy, some of the most prolific
dubbers are major stars in their own right. Their sudden shutdown
practically paralyzed Italy: panicked network executives were
forced last week to air beloved American soap operas in English
with subtitles. Viewers deluged television stations with angry
phone calls and threats.
</P>
<P>
   That show of force had results. Friday, producers and dubbers
agreed to reopen talks on a national contract and the strikers said
they would return to their sound studios. ``They couldn't take the
strike anymore,'' said Andrea Ward, the Italian voice of Andy
Garcia and David Keith.

   WASHINGTON _ Who's afraid of Afghanistan? Iran, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   The Islamic Republic has positioned as many as 70,000
Revolutionary Guards and volunteers on its border with Afghanistan.
And perhaps 200,000 regular soldiers are on the way.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that Iran fears an air and ground assault like the one
Saddam Hussein launched from Iraq 18 years ago this week. That
action triggered an eight-year war that by some estimates left
between 600,000 and 1 million people dead and cost both sides
hundreds of billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Afghanistan's Taliban have only about 40,000 men under arms, so
the primary threat to Iran is not military. It is instead a threat
that is deeply political, and quite humiliating.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since its revolution nearly two decades ago, Iran has
proclaimed itself the model for the world's Muslims. One of the
most controversial articles of its constitution plainly states that
the Islamic Republic shall make ``every effort to realize the
political, economic and cultural unity of the world of Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the Taliban. Instead of showing Iran a little respect,
the four-year-old Sunni Muslim movement, which follows a rigid,
repressive version of Islamic law and controls most of Afghanistan,
has nothing but contempt for its neighbor to the west.
</P>
<P>
   In Taliban writings, members of the Shiite branch of Islam, to
which most Iranians belong, are ``hypocrites pretending to be
Muslims.'' And Iran is branded the ``mother of all hypocrites.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They say they have the purest Islamic regime in the world,''
said Barnett Rubin, an Afghan scholar at the Council on Foreign
Relations. ``Now they are trying to develop a strong central
government around the principle of Islamic law _ and win
recognition as the government of Afghanistan.''
</P>
<P>
   For Iran, the Taliban are just a bunch of backward peasants with
Pakistani and Saudi support who have given Muslims a bad name.
Disregarding the international shock that greeted Iran's own
repression of its people in the name of Islam, the Iranians now are
criticizing the Taliban for going too far.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, for example, women have to cover their heads and
bodies, but can drive cars, vote, hold jobs and seats in
Parliament; in Afghanistan women cannot work or go to school and
must even cover their faces.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, what is happening in Afghanistan today is a
disgrace to Islam,'' Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi said
last week.
</P>
<P>
   So Iran has opposed the Taliban ever since its fighters began
seizing chunks of territory. In loose collaboration with Russia,
Iran now supplies other factions with weapons, money and logistical
support in an effort to prevent a consolidation of power by the
Taliban, who are not recognized as Afghanistan's government by most
nations.
</P>
<P>
   The catalyst for sending troops to the border was the Taliban's
seizure of a group of Iranian diplomats several weeks ago. Most of
the diplomats have been killed, and last week their bodies were
sent home, where they were praised and mourned.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other reasons as well. Iran's leaders claim their
national security is threatened by the instability of Taliban rule.
Iran still shelters 1.5 million Afghan refugees from a variety of
factions who fought the Soviet army in the 1980s _ and Iran fears
that some among them could be criminals or, eventually,
anti-Iranian terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Iran also fears that the Taliban will launch a campaign of
ethnic cleansing against the Shiite population of Afghanistan, a
development that could drive even more refugees over the border if
it is not sealed. In addition, Iran is used by the Afghans as a
market and a transit route for much of their opium crop, which the
massive troop presence has at least temporarily disrupted.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, continuation of the civil war in Afghanistan prevents
Western oil companies from building pipelines to transport Caspian
Sea oil and gas across Afghan territory. Iranians still hope that
if they wait long enough, the United States will change its policy
and allow a pipeline to run through Iran's territory.
</P>
<P>
   For the past two years, Iran has been trying to convince the
rest of the world _ with little success _ to mount a vigorous
mediation effort to stop the Taliban. Iranian President Mohammed
Khatami is planning to use a speech to the United Nations General
Assembly on Monday _ during his first trip there, and his first to
the United States _ to call for international action in resolving
the Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   It may be hard to take entirely seriously Iran's charges that
the Taliban's seizure of Iranian diplomats was an egregious
violation of international law, considering that Iran held more
than four dozen U.S. diplomats hostage for 14 months in 1979-81 and
still has a bounty of millions of dollars on the books for anyone
who assassinates novelist Salman Rushdie for his ``heretical''
writings about Islam.
</P>
<P>
   But the massing of hundreds of thousands of troops on a border
has a way of focusing attention on an issue, and U.N. Secretary
General Kofi Annan has called for a high-level meeting on
Afghanistan this week.
</P>
<P>
   In Iran, meanwhile, the Afghan crisis has prompted an
extraordinary public debate among the top leaders about whether to
go to war. Khatami has said he hopes Iran ``will not have to resort
to non-diplomatic methods, '' and former President Ali Akbar
Hashemi Rafsanjani suggested in a recent sermon that the United
States was behind a plot to weaken Iran by pushing it into war and
that Iran had to resolve the crisis in a prudent and calculated
way.
</P>
<P>
   Where the country's supreme religious leader stands is more
uncertain. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is also commander in chief
of the armed forces, has now backed away from a previous
declaration that Iran would not get involved militarily in
Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning remark that seemed to leave the door open for
groups that might welcome a war fever _ the hard-line Revolutionary
Guards, for example _ he said last week that he was ``waiting
impatiently for our statesmen'' to decide whether to declare war or
not.

<P>
   There comes now news that the FBI kept a file on the late
Groucho Marx while in dogged pursuit of Communists during the Cold
War. This was disclosed in The Nation last week by Jon Wiener, a
University of California professor who obtained 186 pages of the
file under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Wiener says much of the FBI scrutiny came in 1953 at a time when
Marx's band leader, Jerry Fielding, was being pressured to name
Groucho as a communist in his testimony to the House Un-American
Activities Committee. Fielding did not, and was later dismissed by
Marx under pressure from his TV sponsors, a move Groucho later said
he regretted.
</P>
<P>
   The newly disclosed material does not mention Fielding. But
while repeatedly misspelling either Groucho's first or last name,
it provides details of the comedian's apparently modest involvement
in left-wing causes in Hollywood in the 1930s and '40s. And it
includes letters from angry citizens to FBI Director J. Edgar
Hoover, complaining about jokes that Groucho cracked on his TV show
``You Bet Your Life,'' which aired in the 1950s and early '60s.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, here is compelling evidence that Marx _ Groucho, never mind
Karl _ was a subversive.
</P>
<P>
   Well, he was, and proud of it. And the FBI apparently missed
some of the strongest evidence: Groucho's own writing. Excerpts
follow.

discussed Groucho's possible links to the Communist Party:(END

</P>
<P>
   Subject is a radio and TV comedian currently starring in TV show
``You Bet Your Life'' sponsored by DeSoto-Plymouth Dealers over
NBC. Rank and file member of Communist Party (CP), San Diego
County, recently remarked to confidential informant that GRAUCHO
(sic) MARX contributes heavily to CP; however, original source gave
no basis for this allegation. Los Angeles informants familiar with
CP activity in Hollywood motion picture and radio industry
throughout 1940's state MARX was never affiliated with CP and never
a contributor as far as informants are aware.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE)Nevertheless, Groucho's 1963 book ``Memoirs
of a Mangy Lover'' included a chapter conspicuously titled
``Marxist Philosophy, According to Groucho.'' Among his social
dictates: ``The nation needs a good ham sandwich.'' He doesn't stop
there: (END ITALICS HERE)

   Another national need is laundries that will send you a sheet of
pins with every shirt instead of making you pick the pins, one at a

neck. My own laundryman and I have an understanding. Every time he
sticks me with a pin I stick him with a bad check. . . .
</P>

   We need, too, a vacuum cleaner that won't scare the daylights
out of you by whining like a B-707 jet when you try to snatch a
brief four-hour afternoon nap.

positive remarks made about Groucho by a columnist for the
Communist Party newspaper, The Daily Worker:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   GRAUCHO MARX is of working class origin. His father was an East
Side tailor, and his mother sewed in sweatshops. . . . Today he is
one of the most diverting entertainers in America. He has never
forgotten his origin _ and his nonsense contains, as many have
felt, considerable satire and passionate thrusts at contemporary
society.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) Passionate thrusts indeed. As Groucho notes
in ``Memoirs of a Mangy Lover'':(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I am not prepared to say that all American husbands are untrue
to their wives. Au contraire, I think most husbands are faithful in
their fashion. Horace says . . . ``I have been faithful to thee,
Cuynara, in my fashion.'' This is a pretty qualified statement, and
Horace should be ashamed of himself.

opposed the authoritarian, anti-communist regime of Gen. Francisco
Franco in Spain:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   The People's World, Communist periodical for the West Coast, in
its issue of April 25, 1945, page 2, column 4, carried a news item
from San Francisco, California, under the caption ``Anti-Franco
Forces Open Office in SF.'' GRAUCHO MARX was indicated in the
article as active in a new committee called Friends of the Spanish
Republic, which had been formed to insure that no recognition
should be accorded to the Franco government at the United Nations
Conference.

Latin governments in his 1959 memoir ``Groucho and Me,'' recounting
a paid junket to Mexico:(END ITALICS HERE)
</P>

   The first day in Mexico City, we were all herded into a large
assembly room where a representative of the government was
explaining in endless detail where and what our activities were to

   At one point he said, ``I am deeply honored to inform you that
at 4 o'clock tomorrow afternoon you are all invited to meet the
President at the palace.'' I raised my hand. The translator noticed
me and said, ``Yes, what is it, Mr. Marx?''

17, 1960: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that the TV entertainer Groucho Marks (sic) be
investigated as being a Communist. Last night on his program both
my husband and I understood him to pronounce ``The United States''
as ``The United Snakes.''

   In his book ``Groucho and Me,'' he speaks quite affectionately
of Charlie Chaplin, who is a well-known Communist. . . .

<P>
   Please, Hoover, investigate Groucho Marks.
</P>
<P>
   Whimsical Corroborating Evidence:
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN ITALICS HERE) In ``Groucho and Me,'' Groucho did indeed
write of being buddies with Chaplin in the early days. But this
involved visiting a house of ill repute, which may not qualify as
comradeship in the strict communist sense: (END ITALICS HERE)
</P>
<P>
   He was a strange little man _ this Charlie Chaplin. The first
time I met him he was wearing what had formerly been a white collar
and a black bow tie. I can't quite explain his appearance but he
looked a little like a pale priest who had been excommunicated but
was reluctant to relinquish his vestments.
</P>
<P>
   We became real chummy in the ensuing weeks. He was terribly shy,
and I particularly remember a night when we all went to a sporting
house in Salt Lake City just for laughs. The madam took a shine to
Charlie, but he would have none of her, nor did he want any of the
younger girls. Instead he spent the entire evening lying on the
floor playing with the madam's English bulldog.

 &HT;    Dream on if you're looking for another Benben comedy jewel
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's always painful watching talented actors die slow deaths in
shameful comedies. And it certainly isn't funny watching the
normally hilarious Brian Benben straining to get laughs in his
witless sitcom (Monday, 9:30 p.m., CBS).
</P>
<P>
   On The Brian Benben Show, the former Dream On star is, well,
Brian Benben, a veteran Los Angeles TV anchor who gets demoted to
the dreaded human interest beat after the station hires Ken and
Barbie anchor dolls.
</P>
<P>
   So, like, how did the goofy Benben lose his job to Chad (Charles
Esten), a former VH1 veejay who's ``two-thirds hair?'' Well, it
didn't help that audience research showed most viewers wanted to
sleep with Chad and those pearly whites. Hey, viewers know big,
white teeth and helmet hair are more important that something like,
say, credibility.
</P>
<P>
   Now Benben is relegated to interviewing 102-yer-old ladies who
open their blouses and scream the word ``whore'' on national TV.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Benben isn't pleased with his new assignment, so he
scams to get his old job back. That means he'll pull silly high
school pranks like changing the teleprompter disc so doofus Chad
sounds like an idiot.
</P>
<P>
   But the only people who look like idiots are the writers of this
series. If The Brian Benben Show turns into a prank-of-the-week
sitcom, that'll get old fast. There's nothing wrong with broad and
silly humor (see That '70s Show or 3rd Rock from the Sun), but it
does have to be funny.
</P>
<P>
   Benben doesn't get much help from his co-stars. There's the
black sports guy (Wendell Pierce) with no groin (don't ask) and the
gay weatherman (Billy Hernandez) who can tell if Chad is straight
or gay by the donuts he eats (don't ask about that, either).
</P>
<P>
   Advice to the producers: ditch the buffoonery, take more pointed
jabs at the local TV news business (it deserves it!) and give
Benben more bite and funny lines. Only then, can that slow death be
avoided.

 WASHINGTON: the garden.'')  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lloyd Cutler, the veteran lawyer who has served in the Carter
and Clinton White Houses, has the silver-haired elan of a classic
Washington elder. But he speaks of wise men more in nostalgia than
as a promising dynamic in the current predicament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back in the days when we were more bipartisan in this city, we
used the `wise men' approach quite often, especially in foreign
affairs,'' he said. ``But impeachment is highly partisan in its
nature, and it's very difficult to organize on a bipartisan
basis.''
</P>
<P>
   In Watergate, the approach was possible only after the prospect
of removal from office became a certainty for Richard M. Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Some optimists talk of a wise-man bank shot: brokering a
bipartisan compromise of censure by rallying nonpartisan sages and
having them spark popular concern with a concerted warning that
only a strong president will be able to deal with the economic
crises sweeping the world. But one elder, wise enough to remain
anonymous, despairs of even this. ``The truth of the matter is
Clinton just goes through the motions and doesn't appreciate the
wise-men possibilities,'' this veteran summarized. ``And the
Republicans right now are mainly interested in milking their
advantage through election day.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton critics question whether a president who never courted
wise men could turn now to such figures as former Sens. Howard
Baker, R-Tenn., or Sam Nunn, D-Ga. ``George Mitchell is reported to
have turned down the president's offer to become his wise man,''
said Tony Blankley, the conservative polemicist at George magazine,
who rates the former senator from Maine as Washington's truly wise
man in declining to take up the president's folly. ``Certain events
can't be undone,'' Blankley said. ``To avoid a bad news cycle,
Clinton certainly has destroyed a presidency and perhaps truncated
it. This is no longer about the president; it's about the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   In one way, the White House agrees. Clinton, clinging to job
approval ratings of 60 percent, is counting on the public to
eventually prevail as the truly wise one in the crisis, able to
force a compromise on combative Republicans. ``Life is a state of
mind,'' as the tale of Chance the presidential wise man concluded
about Washington. &QL;

alternative to surgery or external radiation for some prostate
cancer patients. (Park, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.

   Editors: The following items from The N.Y. Times Week in Review
for Sunday, Sept. 20, moved Saturday in the `a' category and are
repeated on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-REVIEW _ The government is not necessarily paralyzed by
the Clinton scandal. It has tremendous momentum, and even in times
of war and political crisis it has a way of grinding relentlessly
on. Moreover, the very threat of drift and paralysis in this case
has provided both parties with tremendous incentive to keep pushing
a substantive agenda _ maybe even to push harder than they would
otherwise. By Richard W. Stevenson.
</P>
<P>
   POLTIICAL-SAGES-REVIEW _ Many Democrats sadly agree that the
time may have long since passed for summoning any of Washington's
fabled wise men, like Robert Strauss, W. Averell Harriman, Clark
Clifford. They were part of an informal cadre of emeritus
politicians and lawyers who occasionally dropped by the city's
floating political crap game at critical moments, in between using
their influence on behalf of paying clients, to lend it some class
and even a touch of realism. By Francis X. Clines.
</P>
<P>
   LEARN-DISABLED-REVIEW _ Over the last decade, learning
disabilities have moved squarely to the foreground of the education
world: more than 5 percent of the nation's students now have
diagnosed learning disabilities. Hundreds of thousands of students
in elementary schools, colleges and graduate schools get special
accommodations like extra time on tests, quiet rooms to work in or
note-takers. By Tamar Lewin.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-ECON-REVIEW _ The Japanese are well versed in the art of
fending off U.S. accusations, including perpetual hyperventilating
over Japan's protectionist trade policies. But nothing from the
past could have prepared the Japanese for the latest salvo by
several prominent American economists. They say that the Japanese
government has been insufficiently reckless. By running a tight
monetary policy, wringing inflation out of the economy now and for
the foreseeable future, the government has inadvertently
contributed to a downward spiral of prices and production that has
cost the Japanese nearly a decade of growth. By Michael M.
Weinstein.
</P>
<P>
   FERRARO-REVIEW _ Perhaps more than any other issue, the 14-year
gap since she had been in elective office _ or run for
vice-president, her claim to fame _ dogged Geraldine Ferraro in her
race for the democratic nomination to the U.S. Senate from New
York. She lost last week and declared her political career closed,
which makes this a good time to reflect on what went wrong. By Amy
Waldman.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-DEMOCRACY-REVIEW _ Although the world has focused its
attention on the one-sided battle between the Chinese Communist
government and the political dissidents who press for radical
change, there is also a large population of intellectuals, many of
them scholars or former officials, who work openly to nudge the
system in a more democratic direction. By Erik Eckholm.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-AFGHAN-REVIEW _ Who's afraid of Afghanistan? Iran, it
seems. The Islamic Republic has positioned as many as 70,000
Revolutionary Guards and volunteers on its border with Afghanistan.
And perhaps 200,000 regular soldiers are on the way. The Taliban of
Afghanistan have only about 40,000 men under arms, so te primary
threat to Iran is not military. It is instead a threat that is
deeply political, and quite humiliating. Instead of showing Iran a
little respect, the four-year-old Sunni Muslim movement, which
follows a rigid, repressive version of Islamic law and now controls
most of Afghanistan, has nothing but contempt for its neighbor to
the west. By Elaine Sciolino.
</P>
<P>
   MILITARY-PLANS-REVIEW _ The 1985 invasion of Libya would now be
in the lesson plans of every high school history teacher in America
if it had actually taken place. Instead, the stillborn invasion is
a classic example of Washington's propensity to gin up contingency
plans for seemingly otherworldly operations that never get the
green light. Indeed, there is a permanent infrastructure in the
United States national security apparatus that does nothing but
plan for every conceivable crisis, often with little or no hope
that the plans will be taken seriously by senior policy-makers or
the president. By James Risen.
</P>
<P>
   STARR-SPOOF-REVIEW _ A spoof on a supposed manuscript submitted
by Ken Starr for publication.
</P>
<P>
   LARRYKING-BABERUTH-REVIEW _ After a long silence, Babe Ruth has
emerged for a rare interview on ``Larry King Live.'' By Richard
Sandomir.

 &HT;    Bastrop untucked: It isn't heat they're packing underneath
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It's fitting that school officials in this small
town 30 miles east of Austin have decided to let the high school
students wear some shirts untucked to school.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning on Main Street here, about half the adults I
saw were walking around with their shirts hanging out. So by going
to school with untucked shirts, the students are conforming to the
community standard, right?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what I do: I leave mine out to cover the fat,''
said retired Navy Capt. Bill Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell didn't have on a pair of those extremely baggy britches
the kids favor these days. You know the ones I'm talking about.
They look like they're fixing to fall off. But he was wearing an
untucked T-shirt that sported a cow skull and an armadillo wearing
sunglasses.
</P>
<P>
   When I was in high school you would have been tossed out of
algebra for wearing a shirt like that.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, more than 100 students walked out of Bastrop
High during classes to protest the dress code rule that outlawed
all untucked shirts. The fear of concealed weapons was one factor
behind the rule.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, school officials have decided students can wear
untucked shirts to school, as long as the shirt is meant to be
untucked and doesn't hang down beyond the kid's fingertips.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy is good, if you believe what's good for the goose
is good for the gosling. See, in this town a lot of the older birds
don't tuck in their shirts on the street.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was reared in Austin by good, fine parents, and you never
left the house without your shirt tucked in,'' said Chester Eitze,
56. He's the executive director of the Bastrop Opera House, a live
performance theater.
</P>
<P>
   Times change, though. So on Thursday, Eitze was on Main Street
in an untucked T-shirt that had a drawing of a sloth on the front.
</P>
<P>
   ``T-shirts now are a work of art, and art should not be tucked
away,'' Eitze explained.
</P>
<P>
   Doesn't anybody around these parts wear a tie? ``Oh sure. We
have bankers,'' Eitze said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to wear mine in before I gained 20 pounds; how about a
kolache?'' asked Gail Smith, owner of the Deli Depot on Main
Street. She was wearing a T-shirt that wasn't tucked in.
</P>
<P>
   Marsheila Moore, who works for Smith, was wearing a T-shirt that
wasn't tucked in. While the two of them were working the deli
counter with their shirts hanging out, an older lady walked up to
order something to eat.
</P>
<P>
   The older lady's blouse wasn't tucked in, either.
</P>
<P>
   This is not the start of the revolution. It's not that folks
here are trying to make a dress code statement to support the high
school students. Most of the people I spoke with thought the high
school ought to have a dress code.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the dress code is because of that gang (stuff), and
I'm behind 'em, as far as that goes,'' said Jim Dudley, of
Smithville, 15 miles southeast of Bastrop. He was in Bastrop to do
a little furniture shopping with his wife. For the occasion, Dudley
had selected a Hard Rock Cafe T-shirt. Untucked, of course.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt whether any of these people were packing heat. Several
of them mentioned packing gut as a reason for not tucking in their
shirts. But you can't bust someone for a concealed stomach.
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody wanted to talk about their untucked shirts,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my gawd, I'm gonna be suspended,'' joked one good old boy,
probably 50 years old. He was wearing an untucked sport shirt,
jeans and a gimme hat. He didn't want to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you what, I'd rather not. My wife's a teacher,'' he
said. ``As it is now, before I can watch the Super Bowl, I have to
pass a geography test.''

 &HT;    It's doubtful bland 'Bloom' will blossom
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This guy, Conrad Bloom, has a problem.
</P>
<P>
   You see, there are too many women in his life. But none of 'em
are Ms. Right. And since Conrad (Caroline in the City's Mark
Feuerstein), a budding ad exec, is such a swell guy, most of 'em
are just Ms. Pains-In-The-Rear. Let's see, there's Molly (Lauren
Graham), his needy best friend; Faye, his do-it-now boss (Paula
Newsome); Shelley (Jessica Stone), his harried co-worker; Nina
(Ever Carradine), his activist sister and Florie (Linda Lavin), his
flashy, widowed mom who talks to her dead husband.
</P>
<P>
   Conrad is so nice (he even has pictures of his friends and
family on his desk!), his women call him ``The Fixer.'' Conrad
breaks dates with hot babes to console a teary Molly. He
high-tails-it to jail to bail out his sister, who gets arrested
protecting animal rights and he even goes ballroom dancing with his
mom.
</P>
<P>
   Hmmmm . . . is The Single Guy back? You can't help but think of
that mediocre show when watching Conrad Bloom, yet another ho-hum
NBC comedy (Monday, 8:30 p.m.). And, speaking of NBC, someone needs
to send those programming geniuses a nasty letter saying America
doesn't need yet another white-bread, cookie-cutter sitcom set in a
New York office.
</P>
<P>
   Don't people live in, say, Detroit? Iowa City? Don't people,
like, work in factories? Post offices? Funeral homes?
</P>
<P>
   Now, Conrad is a likable fellow and Barney Miller's Steve
Landesberg is funny as a burned-out ad man, but that's not enough
to save this bland series. But since Conrad is so eager to please,
he probably won't care when he goes from being Mr. Nice Guy to Mr.
Unemployed Guy after this show is canceled.

 &HT;    Kansas State's Michael Bishop may not be piling up the numbers,
but he has the Wildcats on a roll
 &HT;    By Suzanne Halliburton
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ There's no mystery surrounding Michael Bishop
these days. The Kansas State quarterback, who was forbidden by his
hyper-sensitive coach from talking to the media for a four-game
stretch in 1997, is now a bona fide Heisman Trophy candidate. For a
brief period each Tuesday and after games on Saturday, Bishop is
allowed to talk to any reporter who asks a question in person or by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   Problem is, his Wildcats have so overwhelmed their first two
opponents, outscoring Indiana State and Northern Illinois by a
combined 139-7, 97-7 by halftime, that his teammates have left
Bishop little playing time to pad his statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Heisman candidates need stats that fans can dissect each week.
And Bishop's are not Tim Couch-type numbers. While the Kentucky
quarterback, another top Heisman contender, has thrown for 12
touchdowns, Bishop has three. He has completed 12 of 24 passes for
279 yards and has gained 71 yards on 15 carries, playing about a
half each game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not too worried about any stats,'' Bishop said earlier
this week.
</P>
<P>
   He's probably not too worried about the University of Texas
defense he'll face today in Manhattan. The Longhorns have allowed
533.5 yards a game this season, 222 on the ground and 311.5 through
the air. UT did little to control the New Mexico State option in
the second half of its season opener and then boosted UCLA's
hard-throwing quarterback Cade McNown to near the top of the
Heisman heap in a recent game in Pasadena.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop is no McNown, who has an endless supply of towering
receivers at his disposal. But McNown, or any other quarterback
besides Syracuse's Donovan McNabb, would be jealous of Bishop's
footspeed. Toss in the facts that Bishop once threw a ball 93 yards
in practice and has lost only one game in his college career, and
you have all the reasons why this native Texan is the most
dangerous offensive player in the Big 12 Conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can beat you in so many ways,'' said UT Coach Mack Brown.
``He can beat you with his arm. He can beat you with his speed.
He's a running back, he's a quarterback. Kansas State can throw it,
they can out-power you, they can beat you with the option. As a
defense, you've got to figure out what's your best medicine.''
</P>
<P>
   Brown estimated that Bishop, on film, looks like he can run
about a 4.2-second 40-yard dash. Most scouting reports list the
6-foot-1, 205-pound senior at about 4.5.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, it's obvious he can run,'' Brown said. ``Let's just say
that every time I've seen him run, no one's catching him. He's
faster than those chasing him.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Reese, UT's defensive coordinator, said he could use one
player to spy on or ``shadow'' Bishop on every play. ``Then he
could beat that guy, one on one,'' Reese said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They definitely feature him in their offense,'' he said. ``And
they've designed it for him. I think they're about 50-50 run, pass.
They've been pretty basic in their plays. I have seen games where
they have him throw the football. I hope we can get him in
situations like that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bishop's academic situation had been different in high
school, he likely would be playing for the Longhorns today. He grew
up a Texas fan, and he attended two summer camps conducted by
former Coach John Mackovic and his staff. But Bishop did not have
enough core classes from Willis High School to qualify academically
for a Division I scholarship, which is why he ended up at Blinn
Community College in Brenham.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop led Blinn to consecutive junior college national
championships, but he transferred to Independence (Kansas)
Community College in January 1997 so he could earn an associate's
degree _ which he needed to play for a Division I school _ without
having to pass the Texas Assessment of Skills Program (TASP) test
necessary to transfer to a public college or university in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Mackovic looked at signing Bishop, but decided against it
because Bishop was unable to attend spring drills (Bishop didn't
graduate from Independence until August 1997) and UT already had
James Brown as its starting quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop ruled out Texas because he wanted to play for a school
where he could immediately start. He was interested in Baylor for a
short period.

   ``They told me I could play quarterback,'' he said. ``But then I
heard rumors they wanted to change my position.''
</P>
<P>
   Bishop has been a perfect fit for Kansas State, a traditional
safe haven for junior college players. Bishop, in rolling up 2,123
total yards last season, led the Wildcats to a program-best 11-1
record and a Fiesta Bowl victory, where he earned offensive most
valuable player honors with 317 passing yards and four touchdowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's such a talented young man,'' understated Kansas State
Coach Bill Snyder. ``He passes and runs equally well. Most people
accuse him of just being a runner. I take issue with that.''

 &HT;    Coming-home drama is the 'bay' to watch
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You probably won't read this anywhere else: Hyperion Bay
(Monday, 9 p.m.) is the WB's best _ and most intelligent _ new
drama.
</P>
<P>
   Period.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, we've heard about Felicity, the network's other
angst-ridden drama that's getting more buzz than Kenneth Starr's
lurid report. But we still say Hyperion Bay is the better show . .
. mainly because it's not solely targeted for the Clearsil set.
</P>
<P>
   The concept is hardly original. But what is in Hollywood? Dennis
Sweeny (Saved By The Bell's Mark-Paul Gosselaar) is a former high
school geek-turned-corporate big shot who returns to his sleepy
hometown to run a new software division _ and exorcise old family
demons. Things are especially tense with big bro Nick (Dawson's
Creek's Dylan Neal), who's not too happy to see his little bro.
</P>
<P>
   Little bro, you see, is no longer the punching bag misfit he
used to be. He drives a sleek, steel gray Mercedes convertible, has
a head-turning girlfriend (The Thorn Bird's va-va-va-voomy Sydney
Penny) and knows how to stare down penny-pinching city bureaucrats
with the best of 'em.
</P>
<P>
   As his Bill Gates-like boss tells Dennis, ``We didn't fit into
their America, but that's all gone. We're in charge (and) they're
scrambling to fit in with us.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperion Bay is a nuanced and thought-provoking drama. What a
treat hearing twentysomething kids actually talking like they're,
well, twentysomething kids and not worldly 40-year-old former psych
majors.
</P>
<P>
   The juicy drama is also set up beautifully with all the
wonderfully rich characters and relationships. There is the tension
between Nick and Dennis, the unhappy marriage between Nick and Amy
(Christina Moore), the unrequited love between Dennis and old high
school cutie Trudy (Cassidy Rae) and Dennis' stiff-as-a-steel plate
relationship with his dad (Raymond J. Barry).
</P>
<P>
   It all makes for an intoxicating mix _ one we won't mind tuning
in each week.

 &HT;    SHORTTAKES: Annals of leaking
 &HT;    Eds: Originally moved Friday.
 &HT;    By Arnold Rosenfeld
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   You rarely see Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., in the news these days
without it being mentioned on the authority of the writer that he
is widely respected and wise. There are some things you must take
on faith. Hyde is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee,
usually called powerful, since it seems ready to swing Bill Clinton
from the highest limb.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde is notable for his distinguished appearance and his
statesmanlike oratory, a central c asting prototype of a 1930s
congressman. His name has been plastered all over the media the
past few days since someone leaked a humiliating story to Salon,
the Internet magazine. Hyde admitted he had an affair with a
married woman 30 years ago. As a journalistic enterprise, it was
enough to make sleaze cringe.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's stately response, however, may be savored. ``The statute
of limitations,'' he said with what one assumes is characteristic
largeness of spirit, ``has long since passed on my youthful
indiscretions.'' That one's a real keeper. If you do the math, as
several reporters did, Hyde's youthful indiscretion occurred when
he was a lad of 41.
</P>
<P>
   The Hyde leak predictably inflamed Georgia Rep. Bob Barr, the
famously irritable impeachment buff, who perceived in this yet
another criminal charge against Bill Clinton. If the source was the
White House, he said, the leak would be a felony obstruction of
Congress. Nice idea. If we want to get efficient, maybe we can
charge everyone with felony obstruction of everything and not sweat
the details.

 &HT;    Aggies kicker vying for spot
 &HT;    By Randy Riggs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ They weren't long, as field goals go, but in
Russell Bynum's eyes they were big.
</P>
<P>
   Bynum is one of three candidates being scrutinized to replace
departed Kyle Bryant as place-kicker at Texas A&AMP;M, a task that
Coach R. C. Slocum had identified in the spring as the Aggies' most
pressing priority entering the fall. Two games into the season,
though, the situation remains unsettled. But Bynum's field goals of
19 and 23 yards recently in A&AMP;M's 28-7 victory over Louisiana Tech
have left him feeling better about himself.
</P>
<P>
   And, he hopes, it has the Aggies feeling better about him, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel the team wants me to prove something to them,'' said
Bynum, a third-year walk-on sophomore from La Marque. ``I feel the
coaches want me to show them something. Everyone wants me to prove
something.''
</P>
<P>
   Chip-shot field goals, even on a wet field with a water-soaked
ball, aren't enough proof for the Aggies, however. So the
competition continues between Bynum, fellow sophomore walk-on
Terence Kitchens and junior punter Shane Lechler. And the sense of
urgency to find Bryant's successor continues to build because the
Aggies know how invaluable a reliable kicker can be, and how costly
not having one can become.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still a concern,'' acknowledged special teams coach Tam
Hollingshead. ``This is a situation we aren't used to. We got
spoiled with Kyle Bryant.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, A&AMP;M, which faces a tough intersectional contest today at
Southern Mississippi, has not been accustomed to uncertainty with
its placekickers in recent years. Bryant left as the school's
record holder in field goals made (60), extra points made (145 of
152), scoring (325 points) and field goal accuracy (70.6 percent).
Before him, Terry Venetoulias held the job from 1991-'93.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, the job remains up for grabs, Bynum's two recent
field goals notwithstanding. While Lechler has the strongest leg of
the three _ a 51-yarder against Louisiana Tech hooked to the left _
nobody has asserted himself enough to be handed the position
permanently.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I'd envisioned was being settled on a kicker after the
spring _ it didn't happen,'' Slocum said. ``If I felt it was
settled, I'd have put one of those guys (Bynum or Kitchens) on
scholarship, but I won't give a de facto scholarship. I'll save it
and go recruit a kicker out of high school if I have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Bynum, whose 37 field goals at La Marque eclipsed the state high
school record of 30 set by Bryant while he was at A&AMP;M Consolidated,
said his range is up to 55 yards, depending on the conditions.
Hollingsworth said he feels comfortable with both Bynum and
Kitchens up to about 45 yards.
</P>
<P>
   Bynum said he received several scholarships from Div. II
schools, but chose A&AMP;M's offer to walk on because of the quality of
both the competition and the education.
</P>
<P>
   While Bynum says, ``I feel accepted by the team now. If they
send me in there, they must have faith in me,'' he conceded it's
not a complete faith _ yet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It'll take time, mainly, until they realize they have enough
faith in me to send me out there without thinking about it,'' he
said. ``I want them to think that when I go out there, 'He's going
to make this. It's automatic.' But I can't afford to look ahead
like that. All I'm focusing on is the next kick.''

 &HT;    Tamarin taken from zoo might be in danger
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Florida _ A small, 5-month-old, monkey-like
creature with Albert Einstein hair and a chocolate-colored tail is
missing after he and three siblings were stolen from the Palm Beach
Zoo at Dreher Park recently.
</P>
<P>
   Three of the cotton-top tamarins, endangered primates from the
rain forests of Colombia, escaped from the thief or thieves. They
were found later hiding in a bamboo tree near zoo property on
Summit Boulevard.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials said the young primate may not survive long
without a special protein-enhanced diet and the companionship of
his family.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a strong social bond with their parents,'' said
associate zoo curator Randi Meyerson-McCormick. ``A 5-month-old by
himself in a strange place and an odd diet will be very distressed.
They can get depressed.''
</P>
<P>
   An anonymous zoo volunteer has offered a $5,000 reward for the
safe return of the animal.
</P>
<P>
   The four juveniles and their parents are part of a worldwide
breeding program to repopulate their rain forest habitat.
</P>
<P>
   The cotton-top tamarins are beginning to become more popular in
the pet trade, but the thief may just have stolen them because
they're cute.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have a concrete motive,'' said West Palm Beach police
spokeswoman Dena Peterson.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials couldn't estimate what the tamarin might be worth.
</P>
<P>
   The thief cut the lock on the wire exhibit cage and took the
rectangular nest box that the six tamarins huddle in at night.
</P>
<P>
   ``We suspect whoever took the babies may be scratched and bitten
because the fathers are very protective,'' McCormick said.
</P>
<P>
   As Detective H.S. Sutton retraced the likely path of the thief,
McCormick heard the distinctive trill of the young tamarins and
found the three in the bamboo tree.
</P>
<P>
   Zoo officials speculate the thief may have put down the nest box
momentarily, allowing the primates to escape.
</P>
<P>
   With the help of the parent tamarins, the trio was coaxed from
the tree.
</P>
<P>
   The theft was the first since 1993, when two golden lion
tamarins and a kinkajou were stolen. The tamarins were recovered.
The kinkajou was beaten to death.
</P>
<P>
   The zoo erected a 10-foot fence arond the 22-acre property that
year, and guards are on the grounds 24 hours a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turns out that people are its No. 1 predator,'' said zoo
Executive Director Craig Pugh.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of the tamarins without a permit can result in a
maximum $50,000 fine, a year in jail or both. Anyone with
information should call the West Palm Beach, Florida, police at
(561) 653-3400cq or the Tip Line at (561) 653-3480.cq

 &HT;    Ex-Austinite killed on redwood protest
 &HT;    By John Henrichs
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ David Chain would spend his evenings talking
with friends and co-workers about his love of the redwood forests
of Northern California. He would spend his days working to get back
there.
</P>
<P>
   Chain's passion for ``those big, fat trees'' inspired three of
his co-workers at Trudy's North Star restaurant in Austin to follow
him to California two weeks ago to fight to save the redwoods from
loggers.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was so adamant about it. He was very driven, inspired,''
said Gabriel Deutsch, one of Chain's co-workers at the Trudy's,
8800 Burnet Road. ``People in the bar would stop (what they were
doing) and listen to him. We came up here because of his words.''
</P>
<P>
   Chain was killed recently, crushed by a falling redwood as he
and other protesters tried to dissuade loggers with Pacific Lumber
Co. from felling trees at a remote site in Northern California.
Authorities say Chain's death was an accident.
</P>
<P>
   Chain was one of four Austinites who went to California to work
with Earth First, an environmental group known for direct action
tactics such as chaining themselves to trees and driving metal
spikes into trees to impede logging.
</P>
<P>
   The 24-year-old Chain lived in Austin about a year, his friends
said. Chain's identification had an address from Coldspring, north
of Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Chain and his friends were taking part in a 12-day protest
against the logging of an ancient redwood stand along Grizzly
Creek, near the mill town of Fortuna about 300 miles north of San
Francisco. Eight protesters had been arrested Wednesday on
trespassing charges for blocking logging trucks in the area.
Thursday the group engaged in the more aggressive tactic they call
``cat and mouse,'' putting their bodies in front of trees scheduled
to be cut down. Earth First members say the tactic allows dialogue
with the tree fellers.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Garner, one of the Earth First protesters from Austin,
said Chain knew that what he was doing was dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they go up there, they all know what they getting into,''
she said. ``There's a risk of getting arrested, beaten up, falling.
The people involved are willing to give up a lot.''
</P>
<P>
   Chain's death was the first in a decade of mostly peaceful
protests by Earth First against logging, said Gary Philp, chief
deputy with the Humboldt County Sheriff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Philp said the incident appeared to be an accident but his
office is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   John Campbell, president of Pacific Lumber Co., said the logging
crew did not see anyone in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``They felled a tree and apparently heard some yelling, and then
the feller was cutting the tree into segments when the body was
found under a limb,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   Earth First members said they have a videotape of Thursday's
confrontation that will show the loggers knew they were in the path
of the trees.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists have been battling for more than a decade in
the great coastal forests of California, home to the cathedral
groves of redwood trees as old as 1,000 years and towering as tall
as a 30-story building. But the Earth Firsters believe in direct

 &HT;    Bogus bill beleaguers softball team
 &HT;    By Seth Mnookin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Vipers made it to the National Softball Association
Fast-Pitch World Series in Stuart this July, it was supposed to be
the pinnacle of their year. This was why the 10-years-and-under
Palm Beach County, Florida, girls' team had endured the months of
practice and 12-hour days on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, within two days of the tournament's opening ceremony on
July 27, two mothers had been arrested for passing a counterfeit
$20 at a concession stand.
</P>
<P>
   Teresa Zerilli, 33, and Georgina Hill, 31, both of Lake Worth,
are facing felony charges in the case, which is being investigated
by the Secret Service and Stuart police.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a terrible end to a terrific season,'' said former
Viper assistant coach Jim Skidmore, who resigned from the team
after the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the situation has only deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, Brittany Shersty, the Vipers' catcher and the
daughter of Delray Beach police officer Paul Shersty _ who had
alerted tournament officials to the counterfeit bill _ was told she
wouldn't be welcome back when the Vipers suit up next year. That
decision was partially because of Paul Shersty's role as
whistleblower, according to Vipers coach George Ortiz.
</P>
<P>
   On July 28, Zerilli asked Jennifer Shersty, Brittany's
13-year-old sister, to cash what she admits was a bogus $20, police
reports said. Zerilli, who said she received the bill from a Sears
in Boynton Beach two days earlier, had tried to cash the $20 at a
Wendy's and had been told it was counterfeit. After Zerilli learned
that the bill was fake, she did not destroy the bill or alert
authorities as required by law, reports said.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer, being the daughter of a cop, said she'd rather not
pass the bill. But Georgina Hill, the mother of another Vipers
player, took the bill and, according to the report, said, ``I can
get rid of that for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill bought a couple of sodas from a concession stand _ which
was being operated by kids from the tournament to raise money for
expenses _ and returned with $18 in change.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Hill nor Zerilli, who were arrested July 29 on charges
of uttering a forged bill, would comment.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer told her father what had happened. Paul Shersty
returned to the concession stand the next day and told them about
the funny money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had already discovered the fake bill,'' Shersty said.
``They were just totally shocked that a parent of one of the kids
would have knowingly done this. And I was enraged that some parent
asked my daughter to cash this bill. That's contributing to the
delinquency of a minor.''
</P>
<P>
   Initially, NSA officials were considering ejecting the Vipers
from the tournament, according to Shersty. Instead, Vipers coach
George Ortiz decided to get rid of 10-year-old Brittany.
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz insists it is not only Shersty's commitment to upholding
the law that got his daughter thrown off the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sure had something to do with it,'' Ortiz said. ``And
maybe that doesn't set the best example for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``But her mother was real obnoxious all year,'' he said,
referring to Debbie Shersty. ``And I just wasn't going to put up
with it anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Skidmore, who was not invited to a team meeting in August about
the situation, disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we kicked off every kid who had a parent that had been
complained about, there wouldn't be anyone left on the team,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   And the Stuart police department sent Jennifer Shersty a letter
of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's amazing to me that some of the parents think we did
something wrong,'' Shersty said. ``Brittany was up crying all night
when she got asked to leave the team. She's been playing softball
for five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least I know that my two girls have more ethics than most
of the parents on that team,'' Shersty said. It's just sad that my
daughter has become a scapegoat. She's an innocent victim in all
this.''

 &HT;    Some not getting auto tag notices
 &HT;    By Kelly Daniel
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Lester Sanders glanced at his car windshield and
had one of those moments that make a man groan out loud.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was sitting in traffic and just happened to cast a look at
my registration (sticker),'' he said. ``And I realized, my
goodness, this thing has expired.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said that for the third year in a row, he had not
received a car registration renewal notice from the Texas
Department of Transportation. This year he has plenty of company.
</P>
<P>
   The Travis County, Texas, tax assessor's office, which collects
vehicle registration fees for the state, says as many as 30,000
drivers have not received the renewal notices since 1997. The
county blames the problem on a new Texas Department of
Transportation computer network.
</P>
<P>
   The tax office says 900 to 1,300 people a month have called to
complain they didn't get the renewal notices.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints have been steady since last November, when the
county switched to the state Transportation Department's computer
system, Tax Assessor-Collector Nelda Wells Spears said. Travis
County, one of the last to switch to the new state system,
previously recorded completed registration renewals on its own
computer, which officials say was more advanced than the state's.
Registrations are updated on the new network as they expire, so it
takes a year's cycle to process everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``People need to really start to watch that windshield sticker
for the month of inspection,'' Wells Spears said.
</P>
<P>
   What's happening can be attributed to simple growing pains as
the Transportation Department tries to improve its way of recording
and updating vehicle registration data, said Bob Tanner, the
department's director of technical operations in registration and
titling. The new statewide computer network has been implemented in
steps, starting with Williamson County in 1994. Every county has
experienced what Travis County is going through, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For years, about 25 percent of Travis County's 500,000 vehicle
registrations were incorrectly listed in the Transportation
Department database, Tanner said. Many mistakes were caught before
the notices were mailed, but other notices were sent to the wrong
addresses. The department's database had information that was as
much as five months old before the new computer system was
launched. When the Transportation Department's new computer network
is finished _ next August _ there should be just a 5 percent error
rate for Travis County, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The flaws were just magnifying,'' Tanner said. ``There were
more inaccuracies this year than the year before.''
</P>
<P>
   Drivers who didn't get a renewal notice cannot use that as an
excuse if they are ticketed, however. State and county officials
say vehicle owners must remember when to renew, and they note that
the registration stickers are in plain view on car windshields.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for having an expired sticker are $85 in Travis County,
but if a driver renews his registration within 10 working days and
brings that receipt to municipal court, the fine is reduced to $10.
</P>
<P>
   Missing notices aren't creating more tickets for driving with an
expired registration. The Texas Department of Public Safety has
issued about 9,000 fewer expired registration tickets statewide
this year than last.
</P>
<P>
   Vehicle registration revenues have consistently increased, but
state officials do not know if that is because of population growth
or the improved computer network, said Darrel Hunt with the state
Transportation Department.

 &HT;    High school assault troubles Texas town
 &HT;    By Osler McCarthy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   THORNDALE, Texas _ Behind the angst is the mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Prank? Hazing? Sodomy?
</P>
<P>
   At least five people know what happened on an October morning
last year in the high school weight room when four freshmen
football players struggled with another kid. Most people do not
question that something wrong happened _ an assault that violated
privacy, at least _ yet no one but the kids involved knows whether
a plastic bottle was forced where nothing plastic belongs outside a
doctor's office.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened, allegations flew that the football-crazy town
of Thorndale, Texas, 30 miles southwest of Austin, protected the
ball players involved by covering up the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happened in this proud German-Czech farming community
of three state champion Class A football teams and one in baseball
in the last decade, residents believe the mystery ultimately
affects them all.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something happened,'' says Thorndale school board head Anita
Kasner, ``and then everyone added to it and blew it out of
proportion.''
</P>
<P>
   City Councilman Floyd Zuehlke doubts the worst. But if that's
what happened, he says, ``then these kids should be prosecuted.''
</P>
<P>
   The Milam Count, Texas, prosecutor last month filed juvenile
charges in the case.
</P>
<P>
   And the town's angst began anew.
</P>
<P>
   To understand some of Thorndale's collective anger, talk with
the new school superintendent, Wayne Calhoun. An outsider in this
close-knit community, Calhoun found himself after three months on
the job embroiled in what he calls a potentially career-busting
controversy. The school district's investigation was not his to
conduct, to be sure _ he was superintendent last year in Rising
Star, near Abilene _ but the investigation has been his to defend
since the allegations blew up again in August.
</P>
<P>
   First came Austin TV news, then aggravating that, Calhoun says,
an Austin radio station talk show highlighted the alleged cover-up
and invited callers to join with their opinions.
</P>
<P>
   One said the kids should be thrown into prison, to be raped
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody in Thorndale was characterized as something out of
'Deliverance,' ``Calhoun says.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the Milam County prosecutor, Hollis Lewis Jr., in a
hearing earlier this month, accusing the school district of a
cover-up that hindered his own investigation and led to the
10-month delay.
</P>
<P>
   Those allegations are not fair, Calhoun says. The school
district's investigation was good, he says: ``If I were studying
this in grad school, this would have been an ideal investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   Calhoun will not discuss it beyond that. But what irritates him
and others about the cover-up allegation is that everyone in town
knows that the kids involved were removed from regular school
classes and barred from all sports and extracurricular activities.
Calhoun says the district's interim superintendent briefed him on
the case once he took the job last spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just in case,'' he recalls.
</P>
<P>
   Just in case.
</P>
<P>
   Barely inside Milam County, east of the Williamson County line,
Thorndale straddles U.S. 79 and the Union Pacific tracks that
parallel it. The cotton and corn country surrounding this town of
about 1,200 sweeps level from the Balcones highlands, beginning the
great Blackland Prairie that introduces Texas to the Deep South.
</P>
<P>
   Farming built Thorndale, but these days much of the town makes a
living at the Rockdale Alcoa aluminum plant.
</P>
<P>
   Few are rich or poor in this town.
</P>
<P>
   Thorndale's German heritage can be traced in a Lutheran
population so strong it supports a hundred-year-old church school
with 120 students at the west edge of town.
</P>
<P>
   Along Main Street's block-long business district south of the
tracks, many of the sand-colored or whitewashed brick storefronts
sit empty, losers to the Wal-Marts in Taylor and Rockdale, each 13
miles away, and to the malls in Austin twice as far.
</P>
<P>
   A bank brings life to the middle of one side of the street,
together with Butts Dry Goods on one side and the century-old
weekly Thorndale Champion newspaper on the other. Compared with
many Texas towns of its size, robbed of all but convenience stores,
Thorndale appears _ as with its football legacy _ hardy and
determined.
</P>
<P>
   Even before townspeople split over what happened in the high
school weight room _ whether it was prank or worse _ many were
divided over a proposal to disband the two-person police
department.
</P>
<P>
   An Austin TV news crew rolled into town for the fight. Once
there, they found out about the weight room mystery.
</P>
<P>
   And that charges had never been brought in the case.
</P>
<P>
   The TV reports apparently prompted an Austin radio station talk
show that enticed listeners with the story of a school cover-up
protecting football players in football-mad Thorndale.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got PR that we did not deserve,'' says Kasner, the school
board chairwoman. ``There is a question of whether the worst
actually happened or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardly covering up the incident, Kasner says, the school
district investigated it, brought in the police and ended up
referring the four kids accused in the attack to a separate
classroom away from the high school for the rest of the semester
and banned them from school sports for the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``The radio station in Austin just actually tore us up,'' she
says.

 &HT;    Conflict between officials marring already-controversial trial
 &HT;    By Dylan Rivera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMERON, Texas _ When four Thorndale, Texas, youths go on trial
on charges of sexually assaulting a classmate, there will be more
than the usual adversarial tension in the courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney who is prosecuting the case and the judge
who is presiding are locked in a remarkably public and bitter
dispute.
</P>
<P>
   Far beyond the normal courthouse bickering or small-town
squabbling, the battle over the courts of Milam County, Texas, has
itself wound up in court _ three lawsuits have been filed trying to
have County and District Attorney Hollis Lewis Jr. forcibly removed
from office. Some of the ammunition in those suits came in the form
of court findings by state District Judge Charles Lance and another
judge that said Lewis had suborned perjury, lied to a judge and
committed other wrongs. Lewis denies those charges.
</P>
<P>
   Lance would not comment for this story, but had said in court
findings that Lewis committed misconduct in the courtroom. Lewis
said that Lance, the juvenile probation department and the
sheriff's department have each interfered with his investigations
and unfairly criticized his judgment.
</P>
<P>
   The battle is made all the more pointed by the fact that the two
men are old friends who trained together in the Army Reserves
before Lance, a former district attorney himself, persuaded Lewis
to move to Milam County and run for district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   But Milam County's hostility encompasses more than these two.
The juvenile probation office, where Lewis' wife worked before she
was firedlast year, is lined up against the district attorney, as
are some at the sheriff's office, where disagreements over cases
have led to muted antagonism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Normally (the hostility) would be a very big surprise because
each party has a vested interest in seeing that a case moves
along,'' said Jan A. Behr, who preceded Lewis as county attorney.
``But in Milam County things aren't necessarily normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Behr said he has reason to be wary about the politics in Milam
County. He said Lance ran him out of the county.
</P>
<P>
   In Milam County, an isolated pocket of Central Texas that is
just outside the notice of most Austinites, the 25,000 residents
usually enjoy a quiet lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
   The community's dramas are usually insulated from outsiders. But
charges of sexual assault against four high school students have
thrust the community into the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The months-old battle between Lewis and other county officials
went public in June, partly because of the Thorndale allegations.
Eight months had passed since the incident that prompted the
allegations occurred, and Lewis had not decided whether to proceed
to trial or drop the case. By then, the probation office and Lance
were saying they were dissatisfied with the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Debra M. Dillenberger, chief juvenile probation officer, wrote
Lewis that month, saying that he could drop the case or refer it
back to juvenile investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I would strongly disagree with either of these
actions, they are available to you,'' Dillenberger wrote. ``What
the statutes do not permit is interminable delay.''
</P>
<P>
   A week later, her chief assistant, Pete Ortega, filed a removal
suit against Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   The suit presents a list of alleged misconduct by Lewis,
including delays in the handling of 31 juvenile cases and ``failure
to diligently prosecute'' five other cases.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also cites the two court findings against Lewis, one by
Lance and another by District Judge Robert Stem, of neighboring
Falls County.
</P>
<P>
   Lance had found on June 8 that Lewis tried to have an aggravated
sexual assault of a child case dismissed ``based upon a reason that
he knew to be false.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Stem found that Lewis violated the defendants' rights
in an assault case by ``intentionally and deliberately suborning
perjury,'' withholding evidence that would help the defense and
withholding the criminal histories of witnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Two months after Ortega's removal suit, Lewis filed the
Thorndale charges. He said the delay in the case was caused by a
sloppy investigation by the probation office and a cover-up by
Thorndale school officials. His grand jury investigation found
allegations of an attempted sexual assault against a second
student, which was not found in the probation department's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney contends that he's understaffed and being
run out of the county on trumped-up charges. Lewis said the Ortega
suit questions his judgment but doesn't point to misconduct worthy
of removal.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at their allegations and you look at all the other
cases they're saying haven't been handled properly, many of those
have been disposed of and people are on probation,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the judges' findings, Lewis says they are either untrue or
exaggerate what most lawyers would consider small differences in
interpreting the law.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know a judge can say anything he wants, and I'm ready to
go into court in front a of a jury and let a jury of citizens with
good common sense look at the facts,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Citing specifics of what he said was interference by other
agencies, Lewis said the sheriff's department has withheld
information about investigations, including he case that led to the
charge of suborning perjury in Stem's finding. In court documents
in that case, he said the defendants were friends of top
investigators at the sheriff's department.
</P>
<P>
   In other cases, juvenile probation officers have shared
information with defense attorneys instead of prosecutors, Lewis
said.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the removal suit filed by Ortega _ the official who had
fired Lewis' wife from her seven-year job with juvenile probation _
two other removal suits were filed in June by a husband and wife
who were defendants in an assault trial that led to Stem's finding.
</P>
<P>
   State law required Milam County commissioners to appoint a
county attorney from an adjacent county to investigate the removal
cases. But the removal cases seem to be something of a hot potato:
After inquiring with county attorneys' offices from all six
neighboring counties, commissioners appointed Williamson County
Attorney Gene Taylor. With Taylor, the removal suits have
themselves run into another prosecutor's discretion.
</P>
<P>
   Busy with a removal suit against a constable in his own county,
Taylor said he is reluctant to prosecute a fellow prosecutor and
has his own caseload to worry about. Taylor said some justice seems
to move slowly in Milam County, but added, ``It's real easy for
some department to say: `We're doing our job, you're not doing
yours, go do your job.' ''
</P>
<P>
   When Toni Chew returned to her home just outside Cameron one
Sunday afternoon, she saw trash hanging out of a window. Tables
were overturned and destroyed. Only shards were left of five
stained glass windows. Water covered the floor because someone had
broken water pipes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a piano so smashed you couldn't recognize it was a
piano,'' Chew said.
</P>
<P>
   She and her husband, Fred Lundgren, had recently been divorced
and vacated the house on County Road 203 where they had lived for
10 years. Lundgren had moved to the Houston area; Chew and her
17-year-old daughter were moving to an apartment in Cameron. For a
few days after the incident, she feared for her safety and
considered having her daughter stay with relatives in Montana.
</P>
<P>
   Then investigators told her who had confessed to the crime:
three of her son's teammates from the high school football team and
a fourth boy, a basketball teammate who is related to a public
official.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was such a shock,'' Chew said. ``One of the boys had dated
my daughter; one my son had tutored. They weren't strangers by any
means.''
</P>
<P>
   The house was almost totaled _ damage was at least $67,000. And
when Lewis decided to reduce the charge to a misdemeanor, it
epitomized the conflicts over Lewis's exercise of discretion and
the ongoing power struggle in Milam County.
</P>
<P>
   There are other examples of Lewis' exercise of prosecutorial
discretion, on both sides of the tough-on-crime coin. Some of the
animosity between Lewis and the sheriff's office stems from the
time Lewis tried to have a sheriff's deputy indicted for an assault
charge, and another time when he pursued a case of an aggravated
assault with a deadly weapon that he said the sheriff's department
wanted him to ignore.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, there is the theft of as much as $20,000 in
merchandise from a local department store that led only to a
misdemeanor charge. The defendant in that case is the daughter of
Lewis' secretary. Lance, apparently convinced that the woman should
have been charged with a felony, wrote on a docket sheet that the
misdemeanor charge was ``clearly wrong.'' But the grand jury,
having heard evidence presented by Lewis, returned the lesser
charge.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis said he decided to prosecute the case despite the fact
that investigators with the store said they were satisfied that the
woman had paid restitution. He also said the grand jury made an
independent decision. The misdemeanor charge is still pending.
</P>
<P>
   In the destruction of Chew's house, Lewis agreed to a plea
bargain for a misdemeanor conviction, 200 hours of community
service and restitution.
</P>
<P>
   But before the deal was finalized, Lance told the local media he
was ``incensed'' and ordered a grand jury to investigate whether to
return felony indictment. After hearing evidence, the grand jury
indicted the crimes as misdemeanors.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis defended the plea bargain, saying, ``If I had gotten them
on a felony, they would never get into the Army'' and would have
had trouble getting into college. He also said the young men were
contrite, had no previous trouble with the law and agreed to make
restitution.
</P>
<P>
   Discretion on how to prosecute such cases is one of the
prerogatives of being a prosecutor, Lewis said. ``I can give a
break to someone who deserves a break,'' Lewis said.
</P>
<P>
   Lundgren said he did not want the teen-agers to get a felony
conviction, and said he was more or less satisfied with the
outcome: $25,000 in restitution and $42,000 from his insurance
company, which was also compensated by the boys' families.
</P>
<P>
   Chew was not satisfied. She wanted to take the case to trial and
let a judge and jury decide on the appropriate penalty. ``His
decision was arbitrary. It was capricious.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' exercise of discretion in another case was credited by
one young man with saving his career.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Foster and three other teens stole four cases of beer
from the Cameron Country Club five years ago. Because the boys, who
had just finished their junior year of high school with no criminal
history, confessed to the crime and agreed to perform community
service, Lewis dropped the charges on the condition that they serve
one year of probation and graduate from high school.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, 22, works for an oil field company in Alvin. The other
boys involved in the crime graduated and either work, serve in the
military or attend college, Foster said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a fair man _ as fair as I've ever known,'' Foster said of
Lewis. ``He doesn't (make plea bargains) just for certain people,
because my family's not anybody important in Cameron.''
</P>
<P>
   The child of an itinerant military family, Lewis met Lance in
the late 1980s when they were in the same Army reserve unit. Lewis
was practicing law in Bell County and Lance invited him to take
cases in Milam County.
</P>
<P>
   Lance had practiced law with attorney Mark Humble in Cameron,
and for about three years in the early 1980s worked as an assistant
district attorney when Humble was district attorney. Lance himself
was district attorney for four years until 1988, when he was
elected judge for the 20th Judicial District, which covers Milam
County.
</P>
<P>
   By 1990, Lance encouraged his lawyer friend to move to Milam
County and run for district attorney.
</P>
<P>
   Some say the scenario has a familiar ring.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' predecessor, Behr, said he too moved from Bell to Milam
County at the behest of Lance. And, Behr said, he and Lance
disagreed on how some cases were handled, as well as whether Behr
should keep the same secretary Lance employed in the district
attorney's office.
</P>
<P>
   And, Behr said, Lance threatened to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he wanted to keep control of the office,''
Behr said. With the recent death of his wife still fresh in his
mind and an offer to work with a friend in Fort Worth, Behr said he
was ready in 1990 to comply with what he said were the judge's
wishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``You feel forced to leave when a judge says he's going to
remove you from office,'' Behr said.

 &HT;    Teacher, student become partners in crime
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Their friendship began about 15 years
ago at Florida's John I. Leonard High School. One was a shop
teacher, the other his student. Both would go on to bigger things.
</P>
<P>
   The teacher, John George, started a construction business and
became one of the largest home builders in western Palm Beach
County, Florida.
</P>
<P>
   His pupil, David Combs, became one of the county's largest
marijuana dealers. He was recently shipped off to federal prison.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives seem strikingly divergent, but they remain
intertwined. From 1995 to 1997, George and his company, Majestic
Custom Homes, helped Combs build and sell 38 houses on vacant lots
around Loxahatchee _ some of which, prosecutors say, were used by
Combs to conceal the money he made in the drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   Combs, 33, of Loxahatchee, pleaded guilty in January to federal
charges of money laundering by using his drug profits to buy three
vacant lots near Royal Palm Beach. Those lots and a fourth, all of
which had houses built on them under George's contracting license,
have been seized by federal authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors said Combs, who also pleaded guilty to marijuana
trafficking, bought real estate to conceal $750,000 in marijuana
proceeds from 1991 to 1996. He was a link in a chain that brought
more than 8,500 pounds of pot into the county and has so far netted
10 arrests by federal and local agents.
</P>
<P>
   Over those same years, Combs bought and sold at least 70
properties in the county, most of them vacant lots in the western
areas, property records show.
</P>
<P>
   Many homeowners said they found their houses through Majestic's
realty office. Others said they didn't meet Combs until the closing
on their houses _ all of them three-bedroom, usually with white
paint and gray trim. They typically sold for about $90,000; Combs
bought the 1-acre lots at anywhere from $400 to $22,000, property
records show. subhead
</P>
<P>
   George, 47, and Combs met at John I. Leonard High School in Lake
Worth, where Combs was a student (he graduated in 1983) and George
taught shop and construction. Combs' lawyer, Jeffrey Miller, said
George took on the role of mentor for Combs.
</P>
<P>
   ``David didn't have an easy childhood,'' Miller said. ``John
George was his surrogate big brother, parent, confidant, friend.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is an anomaly. He led a double life. He worked very hard
and diligently and was a very successful builder. He did not have
to be in the drug business, and that was the shame of it.''
</P>
<P>
   George left the school district in 1984 after 10 years of
teaching. Months later, he started his development company.
</P>
<P>
   George received his first permit to build a house in the county
in 1985, building records show. Since then he applied for permits
to build more than 1,000 homes _ 878 of them since 1993, records
show.
</P>
<P>
   George has said his company plans to build about 125 houses a
year. In a deposition for a lawsuit, he said his company owns about
50 acres of land for future home construction. In a separate court
hearing, he declared his company ``the biggest builder in the
western communities.''
</P>
<P>
   While Majestic was growing, Combs was aggressively purchasing
real estate. He often bought lots at foreclosure sales or through
tax deeds, buying the tax debt on a property then suing to claim
the land. He also bought many dilapidated properties and fixed them
up for resale, Miller said.
</P>
<P>
   Combs' legal troubles didn't come to light until November 1996,
when he was arrested trying to buy 305 pounds of marijuana from his
supplier, who had turned government informant, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   Combs pleaded guilty to marijuana trafficking in April 1997 and
was sentenced to two years' probation. By then, the federal
money-laundering investigation was under way, and Combs was helping
authorities nab other local pot dealers, court records show.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't slow Combs' real estate ventures. According to
building records submitted by Combs, work on 24 of the 38 homes he
built with Majestic began after his arrest; of those, 16 were built
after he pleaded guilty. subhead
</P>
<P>
   George's lawyer, Brad Beilly, said George didn't know about
Combs' drug and money-laundering charges until he read about them
in a Palm Beach Post story two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   Beilly said George withdrew his permits for homes on Combs'
property in September 1997, after Combs' activities fell under the
spotlight _ not for drugs, but for allegations of illegal dumping
on his lots. Combs was seen on television being led away in
handcuffs when sheriff's deputies searched his land.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Mr. Combs' legal problems were reported, (George's
company) withdrew all of its permits, and Mr. Combs hired another
general contractor to complete construction,'' Beilly said. ``Since
that point in time Mr. George has had no relationship whatsoever
with Mr. Combs.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the illegal dumping charge, George sent a
letter to some of his customers saying his company was not
involved.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Majestic was not implicated in the illegal dumping
investigation, said Deputy James Pearsall, who investigated the
charges.
</P>
<P>
   Pearsall said he plans to ask the State Attorney's Office to
charge Combs with several counts of dumping debris on his sites.
</P>
<P>
   Some homeowners who bought from Combs, like Trish Siford, worry
that they have buried debris on their lots. Siford and her husband
had trouble sinking posts for a fence in their yard because of what
they thought were roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it's not roots after all; maybe it's the tree itself,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Federal prosecutors made Combs pay for underground testing on
the four lots that were seized as part of his plea agreement. Combs
also had to test a handful of lots he sold before turning the money
over to the Internal Revenue Service. subhead
</P>
<P>
   In January, Combs was charged with money laundering; he pleaded
guilty days later. Federal prosecutors seized from Combs $750,000
in cash and property, equalling what they could prove he laundered.
On June 30, Combs began a three-year sentence at a federal prison
in Kentucky.
</P>
<P>
   In the months leading up to his money-laundering charges, Combs
sold or transferred more than 20 properties from his name to his
companies or to friends, property records show. Among those
properties was a 45-acre tract on the Beeline Highway Combs
co-owned with Majestic.
</P>
<P>
   Combs and Majestic paid $100,000 in 1996 for the property, which
is zoned for industrial use. The former owner, Gene Melchiori, said
his father bought the land in the 1960s, but it was limited in its
use because it's largely wetlands.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt like we kind of gave it away. We were caught in a bad
position,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, Combs sold his interest in the land for $10,000 to a
company called Wetlands Are Our Friends. State records show the
company was created just five days earlier by his defense lawyer,
Miller.
</P>
<P>
   Corporate papers filed with the secretary of state did not
disclose the shareholders of Wetlands Are Our Friends, and Miller
would not say for whom he established the company.
</P>
<P>
   Combs also transferred the deeds for 17 rental properties to a
company called D.C. Rentals of Palm Beach County. Joseph Melchiori,
Combs' friend and the son of Gene Melchiori, was named president of
the company in February, records show.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Melchiori could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said many of his clients' real estate transactions were
legitimate, and federal investigators had free access to his real
estate holdings before deciding which properties to seize.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very few guys that are in the marijuana business go to the
lengths that David did to amass a real estate portfolio,'' said
Miller. ``He's made amends. David has given back the ill-gotten
gains.''
</P>
<P>
   Several homeowners interviewed for this story said they didn't
know about Combs' drug activities until they were told by a
reporter. Nevertheless, most of those interviewed found Combs
amiable and accessable, though some thought he used cheap material.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got no complaints about his homes,'' said Rita Wall, who
bought a house from Combs in 1996. ``I definitely would recommend
him.

 &HT;    New treatment may help those with prostate cancer
 &HT;    By Andrew Park
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Charlie Hogg's prostate cancer didn't exactly go
away in one morning, leaving him the afternoon to play golf or go
fishing, as an overeager doctor might have promised. But with just
one treatment that kept the 65-year-old Austinite in the hospital
one night, his doctors think they have destroyed the tumors in his
prostate, leaving him cancer-free, perhaps for the rest of his
life.
</P>
<P>
   The treatment, called seed implant therapy, offers a quicker,
more comfortable and less costly alternative to surgery or external
radiation for some prostate cancer patients, a major reason that
Hogg and about 80 others have chosen it since it became available
in Austin in November. It also shows future promise for treating
uterine and breast cancer in women .
</P>
<P>
   How does it work? Using as many as two dozen long needles,
doctors inject scores of radioactive seeds the size of pencil leads
into the patient's prostate. Over time, they emit enough energy to
destroy the cancerous cells. The procedure has been around since
the early 20th century, but only in the past 15 years have doctors
learned to use ultrasound to guide the seeds into place, making it
a viable treatment for some cancers.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, a Seattle doctor who helped pioneer the technique
published the results of a 10-year study that showed seed therapy
to be as effective at keeping prostate cancer at bay as surgically
removing the entire prostate _ and more effective than treating it
with radiation from an outside source.
</P>
<P>
   Those findings were partially corroborated in a larger study at
Harvard Medical School. The results, published in the Journal of
the American Medical Association last week, showed that low-risk
prostate cancer patients who opted for seed implant therapy fared
as well as those who chose surgery or external radiation. However,
the seed treatment was found to be much less effective in patients
whose cancer had progressed to more dangerous levels and showed
signs of spreading outside the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   This year, nearly 12,000 Texans will be diagnosed with prostate
cancer and another 2,500 will die of the disease. Nationwide, it is
the second-deadliest type of cancer in men, though it can be
treated effectively if detected early. In fact, treatments help 89
percent of men with prostate cancer survive for at least five
years.
</P>
<P>
   But treating prostate cancer can be a grueling, demoralizing
battle between a man and his body made confusing by the variety of
available treatments.
</P>
<P>
   Surgery is still the surest way to beat back prostate cancer.
But because the prostate plays a key role in male sexual activity
as well as urination, removing it can result in lifelong impotence
and incontinence. Patients also require several weeks to recover
from the surgery.
</P>
<P>
   Using beams of radiation from an outside source to destroy
cancer cells in the prostate is a less invasive but less effective
treatment. The radiation can injure other organs, and the rigorous
schedule of treatments _ five-times-a-week visits for six to seven
weeks _ can leave patients racked with fatigue and discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer side effects
</P>
<P>
   Because it is non-invasive and causes less damage to the
prostate and surrounding organs, seed therapy poses fewer of the
side effects of more conventional treatments. .
</P>
<P>
   Last year, two Austin radiation oncologists, Stephen Brown of
Seton's Shivers Cancer Center and Timothy Dziuk of the South Austin
Cancer Center, began thinking about bringing seed therapy to town,
knowing it would be an attractive alternative for some of their
patients.
</P>
<P>
   Brown treated his first patient in November, and since then,
about 65 others have been given seed therapy at Shivers. Dziuk has
treated about 14 patients since March.
</P>
<P>
   While it may be easier on patients, seed therapy is not easy to
perform. It requires careful planning to map where the seeds should
go as well as expertise at reading ultrasounds. Brown insists that
a urologist be present whenever he performs the operation.
</P>
<P>
   As the seeds are implanted, the doctor carefully follows the
path of the needles on an ultrasound map of the prostate. To target
the cancerous cells, some areas of the gland will receive more
seeds than others. Dropping them in the correct positions requires
the precision of an expert pool player retracting the cue before
hitting the ball, and without a steady hand, the treatment cannot
be done right, doctors say.
</P>
<P>
   Precision is also one of the advantages of this technique. When
a patient undergoes external radiation, as much as 90 percent of
that radiation can escape and damage cells surrounding the
prostate, causing serious side effects. That exposure is limited to
about 2 percent with seed therapy, because the radiation is
contained in the prostate.
</P>
<P>
   Impotence still a risk
</P>
<P>
   But seed therapy does have byproducts. Impotence occurs in about
25 percent of patients with implants _ compared with 100 percent of
conventional surgery _ and others will experience problems with
urination. About half of patients will need external radiation to
supplement the work of the seeds .
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Haakon Ragde, the Seattle doctor, found that 64 percent of
his implant patients remained cancer-free after 10 years. His
study, published in the latest issue of the journal Cancer, cited
studies showing that surgical patients had a 10-year survival rate
of between 47 and 73 percent, and patients who underwent external
radiation treatments fared worse.
</P>
<P>
   Ragde's findings have not been universally endorsed by
oncologists, but Brown and Dziuk say the results for all three
procedures are comparable. The problem for implant patients is that
the data does not yet go beyond 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, proper selection of patients is key to the
treatment, doctors say. Not every patient is a good candidate, and
it is a mistake to offer it to those who are not.
</P>
<P>
   Seed therapy works best on patients who have detected their
cancer at an early stage and whose tumors are relatively small.
Hogg was a good candidate: his prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the
test that detects prostate cancer, registered at a safe level and
he was told that he could have deferred treatment for 10 years
before noticing any outward signs of prostate cancer. He decided to
go ahead with the treatment.
</P>
<P>
   Seed therapy also may be more appropriate for older men for whom
the early evidence is comforting enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a young guy who wants to use (seed therapy), there has to
be a realization that the results are only 10 years old,'' Brown
says.
</P>
<P>
   Harry Mitchell's prostate tumor had grown to the size of a pea
and his PSA had climbed to 5.4 (anything lower than 4 is considered
healthy) when he agreed to the seed implants early this year.
Mitchell, 74, lives in Wimberley and liked the idea of a treatment
that wouldn't require repeated trips to his doctor in Austin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was supposed to be a one-shot deal,'' says Mitchell, who
spent the night at St. David's Medical Center after the implants
were put in. He ultimately returned to Austin 23 times for external
radiation treatment to fill in spots the seeds had missed.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Richard Babaian, a urology professor and prostate cancer
specialist at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, says patients
should not choose seed implant therapy over surgery or radiation
simply because it is more convenient or comfortable. Drugs such as
Viagra can help with impotence, and incontinence can also be
managed .
</P>
<P>
   ``I counsel them to think not of the short term but of the long
term,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Still, both Mitchell and Hogg have reason to be optimistic
today. Hogg's PSA has dropped to 0.5 and Mitchell's to 0.3, early
confirmation of the effectiveness of seed therapy. And their
discomfort has been minimal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took about three months to really get my full strength
back,'' says Hogg. ``But now . . . I can't tell anything's been
done to me. If it didn't work, it didn't work, but I still think
that I've made the best choice.''

 &HT;    Commentary: Cleaning closets an exercise in self-awareness
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I have been cleaning closets. It's a late-summer ritual for me,
but this time I've taken on this daunting task with a new
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   A friend of mine inspired me in my closet cleaning duties. She
told me of a technique passed on to her by a friend. You remove
every single item from your closet and then put back only those
things you truly love or that look exceptionally good on you or
that fit perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   One by one, you go through each piece of clothing: the tight,
slinky skirt you bought four years ago after losing 15 pounds that
you've worn exactly twice; the heavy wool sweater that you keep
hanging onto just in case Texas experiences sub-zero temperatures
for an extended period; the three pairs of khaki slacks you somehow
ended up with.
</P>
<P>
   Everything is analyzed. The fat clothes, the skinny clothes and
all the in-between clothes. How long are you really going to keep
that size 8 dress when you haven't seen a size 8 since your young
niece came to visit? On the other side of the zipper, do I really
have to keep that pair of size 16 slacks as a warning to myself to
never gain weight again?
</P>
<P>
   I discovered that cleaning my closet in such a disciplined way
was a lot like forcing myself to grow up. As I packed up a Goodwill
box of the clothes that symbolized my insecurities and some false
hopes, I also began doing an inventory of my mental closet.
</P>
<P>
   What am I holding onto in my memory bank that no longer serves
me well, that no longer fits me anymore? Resentments, insecurities,
anger? What seemed perfect to wear for a season now seems outdated
and childish. Am I ready to let it go, pack it up and send it on
its way?
</P>
<P>
   What about some of my beliefs and convictions? Do I believe
today as I did 20 years ago? Isn't it time to put that tie-dyed
dogma and that hip-hugging hype away? They're not my style anymore
and I need to clean the remnants of them out of my system.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the items I discarded because they just weren't
comfortable anymore. Like three-inch spike heels, they were an
image I tried to force myself into only to teeter precariously.
What am I trying to prove with that image? Do I really care about
that issue anymore? Who am I fooling?
</P>
<P>
   Other ``clothes'' I discarded because they no longer allowed me
to breathe. Any belief or ideology that constricted or limited me,
I unbuckled, unzipped and unbuttoned. I'm too old to hold my
breath. I need space in which to inhale great gasping gulps of
wisdom and knowledge, as much as I possibly can.
</P>
<P>
   Cleaning out closets is a tiresome task usually. It confronts
you with your excess and calls you to be a better steward of your
possessions. With my friend's method of closet cleaning, you must
decide what you truly love and need. That can be an amazing
exercise in self-awareness.
</P>
<P>
   There is a story Sue Bender relates in her book Everyday Sacred
about an earnest young student who seeks out a Zen monk for wisdom.
The monk asks the student to pour him a cup of tea and he will tell
the student when to stop. The student does so and the cup quickly
overflows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't you see the cup is full? It can hold no more!'' the
student exclaims.
</P>
<P>
   ``And so it is with you,'' the teacher answers. ``Your mind is
full of too many things. Only when you are empty will there be room
for more knowledge to come in.''

 &HT;    President of Palm Beach Post passed away
 &HT;    By Tim O'Meilia
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOCA RATON, Fla. _ Robert W. Sherman, the first president of The
Palm Beach Post and its sister publications after they were
acquired by Cox Enterprises, died Saturday, September 19.
</P>
<P>
   He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sherman devoted 50 years to the newspaper business, starting
as a classified ad salesman for the Dayton Daily News in 1928 at
age 18.
</P>
<P>
   He retired Jan. 1, 1979, as executive vice president and a
member of the board of directors of the Atlanta-based chain which
now owns 16 daily newspapers _ including ones in Atlanta, Dayton
and Austin _ and 11 weeklies.
</P>
<P>
   Not only was he the top executive of Palm Beach Newspapers Inc.
for six years, but Mr. Sherman helped negotiate the purchase from
John H. Perry in 1969.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob had a contact who worked for the (West Palm Beach) paper.
He and I went down and negotiated with Mr. Perry,'' said Carl
Gross, retired senior vice president of the Cox group.
</P>
<P>
   Some details of the purchase were worked out when Perry treated
the two buyers to lunch at Arby's.
</P>
<P>
   The purchase included The Post, the Evening Times, the Palm
Beach Daily News, Palm Beach Life magazine and weekly papers in
Delray Beach and Boynton Beach.
</P>
<P>
   Until the Cox purchase, the morning Post and Evening Times
operated under a single editor and a unified staff. Mr. Sherman
divided them into separate newsgathering staffs, each with its own
editor.
</P>
<P>
   The evening newspaper was discontinued in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob was a tall, Lincolnesque figure, very quiet. When he said
something, he meant it,'' said Charles Glover, who followed Mr.
Sherman through the ranks of Cox Newspapers and eventually became
president of the parent company, Cox Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   In 1975, Mr. Sherman was named chairman of the board of Palm
Beach Newspapers and resumed his duties as senior vice president
for development for the Cox group.
</P>
<P>
   He negotiated the purchase of the Austin American-Statesman and
other Texas papers in 1976, then took over supervision of the
construction of a Cox newsprint plant in South Carolina until he
retired.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in charge of development during one of the most active
periods in American newspapers. And he was very keen at it,'' said
Clarke Ash, retired editorial page editor of The Post.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sherman advanced through the ranks of the Dayton newspaper,
becoming personnel director in 1958 and business manager in 1961,
handling all the labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   He headed newsprint manufacturing for the Cox papers for several
years in the mid-1960s. When the Augusta mill was sold in 1968, Mr.
Sherman became Cox vice president for development.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Sherman also served in the U.S. Army during World War II,
spending most of his tour in France.
</P>
<P>
   He received an honorary doctorate in humanities from the
University of Dayton in 1994, said June Sherman, his wife. Mr.
Sherman started a scholarship bearing his name at the university
because he wasn't able to attend college, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``He always had an interest in helping young people,'' June
Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, June, two daughters and three
stepsons. A memorial service will be held 7 p.m. Tuesday at the
First Presbyterian Church in Boca Raton, 600 W. Camino Real. The
funeral will be held in Dayton, Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   In lieu of flowers, the family has asked that donations go to
Hospice By The Sea Care Center in Boca Raton or the Robert W.
Sherman Scholarship Fund at the University of Dayton.

 &HT;    Managed care manages to make our blood boil
 &HT;    By Emily J. Minor
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ We are driving away from the medical
laboratory over on 45th Street in West Palm Beach and I am
explaining to a 7-year-old why his mother just behaved like a
raving lunatic. Indeed, I am trying to figure it out myself.
</P>
<P>
   Why did I glare so at the woman in the little white coat and,
teeth clenched, spit out the order: Give me my paperwork now.
</P>
<P>
   I don't believe I even said please, even though it wasn't her
fault my doctor's office hadn't given her the right information to
do the blood work they'd ordered.
</P>
<P>
   So now, here we are, this kid and I, navigating our way home in
the pouring rain, and I am giving The Talk. The one about being a
good listener and doing what you know is right in your heart.
</P>
<P>
   The one about treating other people the way you want to be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Parents might as well give this talk to a tree, any one will do,
and I realize this (again) when he gives me that vacant
second-grader stare and says, ``Can we have McDonald's tonight?''
</P>
<P>
   And I nearly pull over and start bawling because, see, I'm
angry.
</P>
<P>
   I'm angry about health care. I'm angry about doctors.
</P>
<P>
   I'm angry about the busy signal I get when I call them.
</P>
<P>
   I'm mad because it takes forever to get an appointment. I'm mad
because the first question anyone asks is not what hurts but,
``What kind of insurance do you have?''
</P>
<P>
   I'm mad because the women back at the medical lab on 45th Street
just behaved as poorly as I did. Rude, tired and humorless.
</P>
<P>
   This is what Dr. Jana Rasmussen, a West Palm Beach plastic
surgeon and president of the Palm Beach County Medical Society, has
to say about all this.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody's cranky.
</P>
<P>
   She explains it like this:
</P>
<P>
   Doctors today don't feel in charge. They have to call managed
care companies for permission on stuff that used to be everyday,
run-of-the-mill. Rasmussen says getting through to those companies
is even worse than dialing a doctor's office. (Sure.)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, some studies say that if doctors spend more than
seven minutes _ seven minutes! _ with each patient, they'll lose
money, Rasmussen says.
</P>
<P>
   Now I don't know about you, but by the time I get in to see the
doctor, I've got seven minutes of complaining to do about how I
couldn't find their office before I even get to what ails me.
</P>
<P>
   Rasmussen says we're all at fault. The doctors. Their staff. The
lab folks. Everybody. Even me and you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to deal with these managed care carriers and their
rules and their denials,'' says Rasmussen. ``So our staff is angry
and upset. Then you have all the people in the labs. And then you
have the angry patients.''
</P>
<P>
   She calls it a nasty ``cycle of angryism'' and assures me it
won't get any better until we pressure our Florida legislators to
change the laws on health care. After watching what happened to
Hillary, I am not holding my breath.
</P>
<P>
   All I know is the minute I call a doctor's office and I get the
least little bit of a run-around, I turn on the attitude. I'm
nasty. I'm forceful. I'm tired and put-out. So are they. And I'm
not sure who started it first, but that is not the point.
</P>
<P>
   Point is, nobody's treating anybody the way we'd all like to be
treated.
</P>
<P>
   Time for The Talk.
</P>
<P>
   We all need to be nice. We all need to be patient. We all need
to smile and exchange names.
</P>
<P>
   And, no, we're not stopping at McDonald's for dinner.

 &HT;    Lost Tree emulated, but not first neighborhood charity
 &HT;    By John Murawski
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Lost Tree Village, like plenty of other gated communities in
South Florida, offers its residents a country club, beach house,
pro shops, even a chapel.
</P>
<P>
   But what sets it apart is its optional, residential tax
write-off _ an elite, IRS-approved philanthropy, which allows
donors to take a charitable tax deduction for up to 50 percent of
their adjusted gross income in a single year.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the money taken up each year from residents such as
golfer Jack Nicklaus or General Electric Co. CEO Jack Welch also
makes the charity all the greater an amenity for the area outside
this exclusive, oceanside golf community nestled between North Palm
Beach and Juno Beach.
</P>
<P>
   With $2.9 million in assets and $712,500 given to 53 nonprofits
in Palm Beach and Martin counties in 1997, the 16-year-old Lost
Tree Village Charitable Foundation is among the best organized and
best known among similar groups that have quietly been springing up
in wealthy enclaves all over Palm Beach County.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has developed into almost like a United Way. . . . I told
them, `I wish we could clone you all over Florida,' '' said Dot
Ridings, president of the Council on Foundations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Not everyone feels that way. The creation of each such
neighborhood charity means another contingent of South Florida's
winter residents and wealthy retirees bypasses the local community
foundations, United Ways and Jewish Federations that have
historically been the dominant means for taking up collections and
picking the charities that get the money.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, the United Way of Palm Beach County raised $9.2
million in 1997-98, up from $8.1 million in 1996-97, and the United
Way of Martin County raised $1.7 million in 1997-98, up from $1.5
million the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Gated approach: Isolationist?
</P>
<P>
   Though many admire the Lost Tree Village concept for its level
of organization and commitment, some of the established groups view
the further spread of the gated-community approach with mixed
feelings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that it may Balkanize those gated communities and keep
them from getting to know the larger community and operating in a
vacuum,'' said Shannon Sadler, president of the $80 million
Community Foundation for Palm Beach and Martin Counties. ``I just
don't want them to stay behind those gates forever.''
</P>
<P>
   But Palm Beach County United Way Executive Director Scott
Badesch said, ``Anything that brings in money to human services is
something that ought to be applauded.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, an all-time high of 151 families each gave at least
$2,500 to the Lost Tree Village Foundation. Overall, residents
pumped a record $724,000 into the charity.
</P>
<P>
   Because the Lost Tree foundation is classified as a public
charity, donors not only can write off 50 percent of their gross
annual income if they give that much, but they can deduct the full
market value of a gift of publicly traded stock.
</P>
<P>
   Those are better breaks than afforded by a private foundation,
whose donors can write off only 30 percent of their gross adjusted
income and, when it comes to stock, can write off only what they
originally paid for the stock. A foundation also must pay a 2
percent tax on its investment income, but a charity doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   Lost Tree group changed its legal status from private foundation
to public charity in 1992. While both are Internal Revenue Code
classifications, becoming a charity is tougher because it must meet
the IRS's test for broad public support while a foundation can be
an endowment created by one person.
</P>
<P>
   Giving is not uncommon
</P>
<P>
   Most Lost Tree donors are hardly philanthropic neophytes: Some
have their own foundations and substantial reputations as
philanthropists.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very thorough operation. I'm impressed with it,'' said
18-year Lost Tree Village resident Leslie Quick Jr., CEO of the
Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage firm in Palm Beach. ``You've got a lot of
sophisticated people, a lot of people high up in industry and
charity work.''
</P>
<P>
   Quick estimated he has given the Lost Tree group about $100,000
in eight years. He has his own foundation, the Leslie C. Quick Jr.
and Regina A. Quick Charitable Trust Foundation. He said his
foundation, formed in 1988 and with $6.6 million in assets in 1997,
sometimes gives to the same groups picked by Lost Tree Village.
</P>
<P>
   Lost Tree's gifts in 1997 ranged from $1,000 to the
Salisbury-Sexton/Communities in Schools Memorial Scholarship, a
high-school drop-out prevention program, to $50,000 for the Glades
Community Development Corp., to pay for after-school and family
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The grant recipients are picked by the Lost Tree's 50-person
visiting committee, which sends teams of three to five inspectors
on visits to local charities.
</P>
<P>
   Charities date to '40s
</P>
<P>
   While Lost Tree's charity is perhaps the most emulated, it was
not the first neighborhood foundation in the area.
</P>
<P>
   One of the earliest localized money-raising efforts was the Hobe
Sound Community Chest, formed in 1949. The community chest raised
$290,000 last year from residents of Hobe Sound and Jupiter Island
and gave out $226,000 to 32 organizations. The gifts ranged in size
from $50 for the Hobe Sound Nature Center to $77,000 for the Hobe
Sound Child Care Center. Along with gifts to the Hobe Sound
Volunteer Fire Department, Jupiter Island Garden Club and United
Way of Martin County, the group also gave $100 to the National
Hemlock Society and $5,000 to the Yale School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   The Eastpointe Country Club Charity Fund in Palm Beach Gardens
was formed in 1980. It raises money during one week of golf
tournaments and luncheons and distributes it to charities in Palm
Beach County. It raised $64,000 last year and $675,000 since its
formation.
</P>
<P>
   The Frenchman's Creek Charities Foundation, in Palm Beach
Gardens, was created in 1993 and holds one ``Charity Day'' event
each year, usually golf, tennis and card tournaments. In March, its
595 country club residents and some outside donors raised $76,000
and distributed it to 38 charities.
</P>
<P>
   The Abacoa Partnership for Community, in Jupiter, was created in
December and plans to make grants in Abacoa and surrounding
northern Palm Beach County. Unlike other groups, it will raise
money from businesses and commercial property owners. It has
received a $200,000 start-up grant from the John D. and Catherine
T. MacArthur Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   New groups take tips from old
</P>
<P>
   The most recently formed is the Piper's Landing Community Fund.
The Palm City group, just west of Stuart, received public charity
status from the IRS on June 19. Board member Richard Enright said
the board will seek guidance from the Lost Tree and Hobe Sound
groups.
</P>
<P>
   Enright said most residents of Piper's Landing are snowbirds
with a charitable bent but little knowledge of area nonprofits.
They need help sorting through solicitations but also want to make
their philanthropy more engaging than just writing checks to
strangers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The board of directors will be able to chat about the
activities when they're playing golf,'' he said. ``What you want to
have is the personal connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Money raising by the Lost Tree Village Charitable Foundation
also is deliberately low-key, with members often promoting their
causes on the golf course and at bridge parties, said foundation
President James Gillin. Each year, the group also mails Lost Tree's
500 households a money-raising letter and holds a party for
benefactors who gave at least $2,500 in the past year or $25,000
total.
</P>
<P>
   Last year's soiree honored the largesse of such residents as
Nicklaus; Welch, of General Electric; Lawrence Bossidy, the CEO of
aerospace engineering giant Allied Signal; Bradford Boss, CEO of
pen maker A.T. Cross Co.; Stanley Druckenmiller, top money manager
at Soros Fund Management; and Paul Evanson, president of Florida
Power &AMP; Light Co.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of the November party _ $7,697 _ was the charity's top
money-raising expense in 1997, according to its tax return. It also
spent $7,076 on printing and mailing annual reports and a
newsletter.
</P>
<P>
   That means Lost Tree spends just over 2 percent of its annual
take on raising money. A typical national charity spends around 15
percent to 20 percent of its money to raise money, according to the
National Charities Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   Lost Tree Village Charitable Foundation's executive director,
Pamela Rue, is the only paid employee, making $56,000 last year.
Hobe Sound's charity also has a paid employee, and Abacoa's will.
For all administrative expenses, including Rue's salary, the Lost
Tree charity spent about 14 percent of the money it raised last
year. But Rue said no contributions were used to pay any
administrative or money-raising expenses; thatsalaries and
money-raising costs came from investment income.
</P>
<P>
   The United Way of Palm Beach County says it spends about 13
percent on administration.

 &HT;    Economical Lumina PCC scans and copies in color
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I wouldn't expect much from a machine that claims to copy and
scan, with an automatic document feeder and optical character
recognition, all for a list price of $250.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the Lumina PCC, I was mistaken.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of this machine, Lumina Office Products, calls the
product a ``color copier.'' It would be more accurate to call it a
color scanner, since it isn't a color copier unless you've got a
color printer.
</P>
<P>
   It's a relatively small but very sturdy-seeming machine that
performs both flatbed and drum scanning. The flatbed area is only a
little larger than letter size, but the drum scanner _ used in
conjunction with the automatic document feeder _ will scan a
document 35 inches long. I don't know of anyone with a document 8.5
inches wide and 35 inches long, but if you're into scrolls, this is
the machine you need.
</P>
<P>
   The PCC connects your printer and your computer. For whatever
reason, it has no on-off button, which I find rather disconcerting.
After 90 minutes of idling, the scanner light goes out, cutting
down on power use and wear and tear. But I'd rather be able to turn
it off without unplugging it.
</P>
<P>
   Once set up, the machine automatically located my Lexmark 5700
printer.
</P>
<P>
   To make copies, you simply position the document to be copied on
the sheet feeder or on the glass of the flat scanner and press the
copy button on the machine. It's no speed demon, but you'll get
your copy out of your printer in a minute or so, and if your
printer is a decent one and in good shape, it'll be a good copy.
</P>
<P>
   It will make a color copy if you punch the color copy button.
</P>
<P>
   Copies can be scaled up or down, depending on what your printer
can handle. Up to 99 copies can be programmed.
</P>
<P>
   Scanning images, of course, is best done on the flatbed scanner
and involves the simple software that comes with the PCC. The
machine takes up to two minutes to calibrate itself before every
scan, which can be a little annoying, but for the price I could
acquire some patience.
</P>
<P>
   The software allows you to prescan the image on the bed and then
select a portion of it for copying. Once scanned, you can save it
in one of several standard graphic formats or drag-and-drop the
image into whatever image-handling software you have. Ulead iPhoto
Express comes with the machine.
</P>
<P>
   I couldn't tell any appreciable difference between scans of the
same photograph made with the PCC and with our Microtek scanner.
</P>
<P>
   For optical character recognition _ turning an image into an
editable document _ you simply select that function in the
software. The OCR conversion, done by built-in software, is made
quickly and automatically, and the results are pretty good. You'll
have to do some editing, but with a good original it should be
minimal.
</P>
<P>
   It's here the automatic sheet feeder comes in handy. If you've
got 10 or 12 (or up to 99) sheets to scan, just drop them on the
feeder and they will be done sequentially.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to scan an image or document and then fax it
somewhere, the machine has a fax mode which will make automatic use
of your fax software and fax modem. It will also set up as an
attachment for e-mailing.
</P>
<P>
   The machine is pretty simple and the documentation, while
jumbled, is quite adequate. There is a ``guided tour'' in the
software; avoid it, it's more of a sales pitch then an aid for
someone who's already bought the product.
</P>
<P>
   If you already have a good printer _ it will work with laser
printers as well as ink jets _ the Lumina PCC will do some
yeomanlike work at a very reasonable price. Lumina has a Web page
at http://www.luminapcc.com.

 &HT;    On top of ol' Smokies
 &HT;    By Angel Bedinghauszent
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA VILLAGE, N.C. _ It took a village to make our family's
summer vacation a fun one.
</P>
<P>
   The Historic Fontana Village, that is, a sprawling resort in
northwest North Carolina. The nearest town is a 22-mile, twisting,
rolling drive to the south. To the north looms the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The resort is far from the tourist crowds in Gatlinburg and
Cherokee, which is why we picked it as our springboard for three
days of exploring the Smokies this summer. But there was more to
Fontana Village _ it really was historic.
</P>
<P>
   The name Fontana derives from a 1700s French explorer, but the
village itself is tied to one of the greatest engineering feats in
this country's history _ the Fontana Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin
Roosevelt gave the go ahead for making the atomic bomb, and gave
the Tennessee Valley Authority the job of providing power for it
and other war-time projects.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, thousands of workers converged on this remote
outpost. At the height of the project, 6,000 worked around the
clock. When completed in 1945, it was the largest dam east of the
Rockies. Standing 480 feet high, and three football fields wide at
its base, it holds back the 11,685 acre Fontana Lake.
</P>
<P>
   A spinoff of the project was a village, a couple miles from the
dam, and home to the workers and their families. Complete with
cabins, schools, church, a large hospital, recreation hall,
swimming pools and a ball field, the village was the TVA's way of
keeping workers happy so they would stay with the grueling project.
</P>
<P>
   When the dam was finished, the village was left high and dry.
(The dam is operated by just six employees today.) The TVA turned
to Government Services Inc. for help. They converted it into a
vacation resort. In its heyday in the early '70s, Fontana Village
called itself one of the square dance capitals of the world,
offering 10 festivals a year. In 1985, the property was purchased
by Peppertree Resorts and it still offers several dance festivals
in the fall and spring. It now includes 150 cabins, 94 hotel rooms
and tent camping.
</P>
<P>
   After checking in, we passed by a few well-kept cabins and went
through the village common area. This is where the action is: the
tennis courts, cafe, fishing pond, bike shop and rentals, indoor
and outdoor pools, recreation and game hall, general store, ball
field and a huge central lawn.
</P>
<P>
   A road that seemed nearly vertical to my South Floridian eyes
took us to our cabin. We gambled that the weather would be pleasant
(and it was) and reserved a cheaper cabin (in season $89) without
air conditioning, though it does have heat for the cool fall
nights. The cabin also came without phone or television, which was
fine with us.
</P>
<P>
   Our cabin was a duplex, weathered on the outside but recently
remodeled on the inside. It was built into the side of hill, and we
climbed a long wooden staircase to the front porch. A living/dining
room, kitchenette, two bedrooms and bath made up our simple
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin had none of the extra touches of a hotel. No tiny
bottles of shampoo, bath soap, or even dishwashing soap. Towels are
provided, along with pots, pans, dishes and utensils. Reading the
village newsletter, we learned there was no daily maid service. But
the cabin felt clean and fresh, and though we weren't in the middle
of the woods, the cabins are spread out among shady trees.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter gave a daily schedule of guest activities, some
free. They included bingo, marshmallow roasts, crafts, guided
hikes, mountain bike clinics, softball games, a scavenger hunt, and
trips to white water rafting, the nearby Joyce Kilmer Memorial
Forest and the cabin used in the movie Nell, starring Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   With all these options, it was easy to spend an entire vacation
in and around the village. We had taken two days driving from West
Palm Beach with our three kids ages 7 and under, and it was time to
stretch. We decided to explore the area on bikes, since the
resort's stables, swim club, marina and dam were just 3 miles or so
away.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to realize a Florida mile on bikes is quite
different than a mountain mile! After huffing and puffing up hills
for about a half mile, we turned back for our car. During the next
few days, we discovered driving was the best way to explore this
hilly landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other attractions we explored, and their distance
from Fontana Village:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fontana Dam, about 3 miles from the Village: Even if looking
at a slab of concrete holding back a bunch of water sounds like a
snoozer, you will be impressed. We drove to the base of the dam,
but its massiveness is more apparent from the top. A road, closed
to vehicles, lets you walk out over the dam and look 400 feet
straight down to the spillway.
</P>
<P>
   There is a visitors center manned by a few volunteers, some who
worked for the TVA when the dam was built. From the center, for a
couple of dollars, you can take an incline tram down into the
powerhouse. The exhibits there explain how the dam generates
electricity, plus you see the control room and the dam from the
bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cherokee, about 45 miles. The Cherokee Indians have a long
history in the Smoky Mountains. The ones who live on the Cherokee
Indian Reservation now are descendants of Cherokees who hid from
the Trail of Tears _ when American Indians were forced on a journey
to government-owned land in Oklahoma about 160 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation is outside a main entrance to the Smokies. The
main road resembles in many ways a commercialized strip in any
Florida beach resort town. Instead of hocking seashells and
T-shirts, it's moccasins and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at the Oconaluftee Indian Village, which has an
hourlong guided tour of old Cherokee housing and demonstrations of
traditional crafts.
</P>
<P>
   We learned about Cherokee society, customs and history. A
peaceful nation, the Cherokee never wore warrior headdresses, and
as a farming tribe, they never used tepees, but rather more
permanent dwellings made of mud, wood, and thatch.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Museum of the Cherokee Indian and crafts at the
Qualla Co-op. Each night, there is an outdoor drama called Unto
These Hills about the Trail of Tears.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clingmans Dome, about 25 miles from Cherokee. (Closed Dec. 1-
April 1). This stop was one of the busiest during our trip. At
6,642 feet, Clingmans Dome is the highest elevation in the Smokies
and the third-highest summit east of the Mississippi. With
countless other visitors, we followed the wide, sloping walkway for
a half a mile. A steep circular ramp takes you up the final ascent
to the top of a concrete tower.
</P>
<P>
   On clear days, you can see beyond the Smokies. We picked one
when the sky was heavy with low clouds, so low (or we were so high)
that sometimes we were actually in them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wayah Bald, about 50 miles. For the final leg of our drive to
Fontana Village, we decided to take the scenic U.S. 64 to Wayah
Bald, a 5,342-foot peak with a stone observation tower. The long,
winding road led to a turnoff, and then a steeper, dirt road that
climbed another 4 miles to a parking area. After a short hike to
the tower, the kids could see where all that steep climbing landed
us. They were awestruck by their first view from atop a mountain.
Below were the towns we just traveled through and beyond to
Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   _ White-water rafting, about 35 miles. Several companies offer
guided and self-guided rafting trips down the Nantahala River in
six to eight-person rafts and inflatable kayaks. My husband and son
took a guided trip with the Nantahala Outdoor Center. The company
charges a few more dollars than others, but has a very good
reputation. For an additional fee, they also provide day care for
younger children.
</P>
<P>
   The novice father-son pair were part of a larger group of six
rafts and three guides. A bus took them 8 miles up river to launch.
From there, the current pushed them down river. Paddling was
reserved for maneuvering around rocks and rough waters. Though
there is a 60 pound weight minimum, the tour is perfect for first
time rafters and families. The dam-controlled river is predictable,
but with enough rocks and small drops to make it exciting. The
total time for the 8 mile long adventure is 3 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cades Cove and Parson Branch Road, about 60 miles. Cades Cove
is an expansive, flat meadow within the national park. Around the
turn of the century, it was home to a small but thriving farming
community. An 11-mile, one-way road circles the meadow with
pulloffs at the remaining cabins, churches, a cemetery and fields,
which are still used to grow hay. Deer are often spotted and we
were treated to a doe and fawn ambling across a mown field.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway around the road is a visitor center and old farm
house. A mill, powered by an old wooden water wheel, still makes
corn meal. Check the Smokies Guide for ranger-led programs; several
were listed during our trip.
</P>
<P>
   After stopping at the visitor center, we turned off the cove
road for a short-cut back to Fontana Village on Parson Branch Road,
a one-way dirt passage. This ``unimproved'' road took us deep into
the Smokies, a side of the mountains we wouldn't have seen unless
we did some rugged hiking. We drove slowly for 8 miles alongside a
small creek. Heavy green foliage grew on either side with sunlight
barely filtering in.
</P>
<P>
   As we bumped farther along over rocks and through divots, the
creek grew wider and faster, snaking back and forth over the road.
Remembering the rain earlier in the day, we wondered how much
deeper it would get, but at the next crossing point, a short bridge
took us over the creek.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the creek funneled through large steel tunnels into
the Little Tennessee River, and Parson Branch Road took us to the
highway that would lead us out of the Smokies and back on the road
again.
</P>
<P>
   FALL SOON TO COLOR SMOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Missing the colors of fall? Consider driving up to North
Carolina. The long, dry summer in the Southeast should create ideal
conditions for brilliant fall foliage.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves should start to change color in a couple of weeks and
last into November.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's scenic drives and historic bed-and-breakfasts
will fill with those who want to witness the most colorful season
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   By late September, cool air is expected to bring a bounty of
wildflowers, including asters and goldenrods.
</P>
<P>
   The varying elevations in the state, from the tops of the Great
Smoky Mountains to the flatlands along the coast, will mean many
peak weeks throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   A foliage hot line will begin service late this month.
Meanwhile, call (800) VISIT-NC for information about fall events,
hotels and scenic drives.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKY FACTS

   How big: Great Smoky Mountains National Park covers 517,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Where it is: The park straddles 60 miles of the North
Carolina-Tennessee state line.
</P>
<P>
   Peak facts: Sixteen peaks inside the park rise above 6,000 feet,
making them the highest mountains east of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors: Ten million people visit the park each year. Summer
and the October fall color season are the busiest times in the
park. Holidays also are busy. The best times to visit include
September, mid-November and late March through May.
</P>

 &HT;    Treasure salvors win battle, bring coins back to U.S.
 &HT;    By Bill Douthat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A fortune in silver from a 17th century shipwreck is headed to
Florida, its journey delayed for more than a year while treasure
salvors battled with Ecuador's government over the booty of coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are glad it's over, and we are happy the split was finally
honored,'' said Rob McClung of West Palm Beach, the expedition
leader who recovered nearly 6,000 coins from the shipwreck in early
1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador will keep half of the coins. The other half is being
transported to a Central Florida lab for cleaning and inventory.
</P>
<P>
   The coins are from the Spanish galleon La Capitana, which sank
off the Ecuador coast in 1654 when the pilot made a navigation
error and ran the 130-foot ship aground. Most of the 216 treasure
chests aboard were salvaged, but McClung found thousands of coins
buried beneath the ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   The coins had been stored since May 1997 in the Central Bank of
Ecuador in Quayaquil. They were kept there as the salvors fended
off claims from rivals that coins were being smuggled out of
Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   The government exonerated the salvors and granted the expedition
company its 50 percent share on Sept. 9, said German Moro of
Reston, Va.
</P>
<P>
   Moro's Sudamerica Discovery Inc. held the permit for the salvage
operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took a year-and-a-half of hardball legal maneuvering to
force the government to do the split,'' said Moro.
</P>
<P>
   The salvors stopped digging in April and filed a $25 million
lawsuit against government officials to force a division of the
treasure.
</P>
<P>
   Moro said representatives from the Ecuadorean finance, education
and defense spent five minutes examining the two piles of coins and
chose the one topped with a gold cross and a pair of chart
dividers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could very well be the instrument the pilot used when he
made his mistake,'' Moro said.
</P>
<P>
   The salvor's half, which Moro estimates has a value of more than
$1 million, will be divided among investors in Ecuador and the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   McClung's Oceanic International Corp. has a 5 percent share of
the treasure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone will get rich, but there will be enough
to make a nice return for the investors,'' Moro said.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the coins, McClung's divers brought up silver bars,
bronze cannon balls, candelabra and dinnerware from the treasure
galleon.
</P>
<P>
   ``For me, it's never been the treasure since I was not getting
the lion's share of it'' McClung said.
</P>
<P>
   He said his reward was finding the ship and the vindication of
allegations from rival treasure hunters that he plundered the
wreck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing comes easily, but not everything should be that
hard,'' he said Friday from his home in Lake Clarke Shores.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, McClung vowed never to return to Ecuador.
</P>
<P>
   Now he said he's thinking of returning because Moro's group was
issued a new permit by the government to continue digging at the
site.

 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Today let's visit a store where shoplifting is encouraged.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, there are literally thousands of stores like this.
They're all located on the Internet and each contains more software
than you could ever use. You're welcome to drop by and download as
much as your hard disk can hold.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, you'll be asked to pay a small registration fee
if you decide to keep and use the software (that's a category of
software called ``shareware'') but in other cases, you don't owe a
penny.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the same kind of variety of software on the Net that
you'd see in a real store _ everything from games, to databases, to
word processors, to Internet software, to special purpose programs
for most jobs and hobbies.
</P>
<P>
   Since all of us have different interests, your best bet is to go
to one of these download sites and use keywords _ just as you would
to search the Web _ to locate the sort of programs that interest
you.
</P>
<P>
   There are an almost endless number of sites dedicated to storing
and organizing this free stuff. Instead of giving you a long list
of Web addresses, let me tell you about a single site that contains
hotlinks to some of my favorite download services.
</P>
<P>
   It's part of the Web site maintained by MindSpring, but you
don't have to be a member to use it. You'll find the collection of
links at
http://content.mindspring.com/sections/computing/download.html.
</P>
<P>
   Visit the library
</P>
<P>
   Since that list is exhaustive enough for most of us _ you'll
find sites offering shareware for Macintosh and Windows computers;
software for older machines running pure DOS, games that'll run on
that old Atari stuck away in the attic, some good programs for the
wireheads that use Unix and OS/2, and even source code (the raw
code just as it looked when created by the programmer) _ we won't
spend much more space offering addresses for additional sites.
Instead, let's talk about a few of the sites you'll find on this
link page.
</P>
<P>
   Most of us spend at least half of our computing time on the
Internet nowadays. Tucows (http://www.tucows.com) is a specialized
library of Internet software _ newsgroup readers, Web browsers,
e-mail programs and special utilities that measure the quality and
speed of your Internet connection.
</P>
<P>
   Since Tucows has mirror sites (duplicate libraries of the
software) all across the world and nation, you should be able to
find a site near you to make it more likely the download will be
speedy.
</P>
<P>
   The next site, Shareware.com (http://www.shareware.com), does
the best job of offering software for almost any type of computer.
It's a good general purpose library with almost any kind of
software you can imagine. Macintosh users will be happy with the
good selection of Mac programs there.
</P>
<P>
   However, since Macintosh users are often shortchanged when it
comes to shareware, they'll also want to pay special attention to
Info-MAC HyperArchive (http://hyperarchive.lcs
</P>
<P>
   .mit.edu/HyperArchive.html), which offers nothing but Mac
programs.
</P>
<P>
   One program most new downloaders encounter, no matter what type
of computer they use, is a decompression program. It's needed
because most programs available for download have been
``compressed.''
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, all these sites offer programs that will decompress the
software. Since there are several programs that can be used _ and
since most are specific to the type of computer platform you use _
just search for the programs using the keyword ``compress.''

 &HT;    Take our Word for it, writing programs thrive
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite Microsoft Word's hegemony, Mac users have plenty of good
choices when it comes to writing programs. All are less expensive
than Word, which now costs a whopping $369.95, and offer most of
its features.
</P>
<P>
   This is not to say Word is a bad program. It's just right for
many people _ but not all.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, then, is a quick look at the Mac's best writing
programs. It's an effort designed to help you pick the right
program, given your needs and budget.
</P>
<P>
   Let's start with Word, which remains the most popular and
powerful program in terms of features. Word 98 may be the best
version of the program yet for the Mac. It's lightning fast
compared to its predecessors and, as always, chock-full of new
features. Word remains the only program that lets you create
interactive outlines and work collaboratively on one document.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, these strengths are offset by lots of weaknesses.
Word 98 works sluggishly on anything other than the fastest Power
Mac. Many of its features don't work well or as advertised. The
program is also buggy.
</P>
<P>
   None of Word's competitors suffer from these problems. And one
of the best writing programs may have come on your Mac.
</P>
<P>
   It's called AppleWorks, formerly ClarisWorks, and is a wonderful
program. No word processor is easier to use, whether writing a
letter or laying out a newsletter. Like Word, AppleWorks comes with
hundreds of templates for letters, resume and other documents.
</P>
<P>
   AppleWorks' weakness is a lack of advanced features. It won't,
for example, automatically correct typos or create indexes and
tables of content.
</P>
<P>
   Word has these features and so does Nisus Writer, which retails
for $99.95. Nisus is a powerful and innovative program with a
clean, simple interface that avoids the cluttering panels of
buttons favored by Word and AppleWorks.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus also lets you select and edit non-contiguous text, keep up
to 10 clipboards and undo a near endless number of steps at a time.
</P>
<P>
   Nisus' weaknesses are threefold. It can't make outlines and the
way it handles both tables and styles is clumsy. The program
doesn't come with a lot of templates.
</P>
<P>
   A less expensive alternative to Nisus is Mariner Write, which
retails for $69.95. It can't create a table of contents but lets
you easily manage styles and create tables.
</P>
<P>
   Mariner Write is lean, fast and responsive. It's a good choice
for laptops or older Macs.

 &HT;    Toys leap to life in action-movie game
 &HT;    By Yusuf Davis
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Small Wonders'' was a huge hit in the Farris household, in
Mableton.
</P>
<P>
   The PC fighting game of action toys captivated reviewer Jesse
Farris, 12, and his brothers _ Jacob, 9, and Joseph, 8 _ with its
vivid graphics and fierce fighting action. For hours on end, the
Farris boys and several neighborhood friends waged battle against
enemy forces, knocking off different body parts until the final
blow is struck.
</P>
<P>
   ``We play it a lot,'' Jesse said. ``It's a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on this summer's popular action-adventure movie ``Small
Soldiers'', the storyline of ``Small Wonders'' is similar to the
film, but different enough to give players a new experience. There
are two different plots that unfold, based on the player's choice.
To win the battle, players must uncover new insights into each
character's strengths and weaknesses. Puzzles are layered within
each mission, requiring players to use their wits and
problem-solving skills. Gamers can create an original Commando or a
Gorgonite by choosing from a variety of bodies, heads, arms and
legs, each with unique battle advantages. New action figures can be
customized from hundreds of textures, colors and decals and
equipped with special battle accessories. Built and dressed for
battle, the soldiers are trained in their new moves, then it's off
to battle in one of five interactive 3-D environments.
</P>
<P>
   Creations can also be saved to disk and imported to play on a
friend's computer.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse said he really liked the graphics, but his favorite part
is that the game offers lots of options.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like the fact that you not only play with the regular
characters, but you could create your own,'' he said. ``Another
good thing is that you can select different levels of play.''
</P>
<P>
   Recommended ages: 6 and up.
</P>
<P>
   Minimum PC system requirements: Pentium 100 MHz or higher, 16
megabytes RAM, 30 MB free hard drive space, 4X CD-ROM drive, 1 MB
SVGA card, sound card, mouse, DirectX v.5.

</P>
<P>
   on Web
</P>
<P>
   Children's software maker Humongous Entertainment recently
``flipped the start switch'' on two new features to its redesigned,
award-winning http://www.humongous.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Families visiting the site can discover an exclusive new
``Making of Blue's Birthday Adventure'' feature dedicated to the
creation of the highly anticipated ``Blue's Clues'' CD-ROMs, plus a
new online weather game starring the world's youngest superhero,
Pajama Sam. The new Web site design makes it easy for kids to find
their favorite activities, the latest downloads and new features
every time they visit.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site also provides families with fun activities kids and
parents can enjoy together, both on and off the computer, said John
Uppendahl, Humongous Entertainment's vice president of
communications and online business development. Whether playing an
online mini-game, asking questions directly to Freddi Fish in
``Frankly Freddi'' or printing out a putt-putt car to color, cut
out and assemble, there are tons of activities that will keep
families entertained for hours.
</P>
<P>
   `Making of Blue's
</P>
<P>
   Birthday Adventure'
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Clues,'' the hit TV show for preschoolers, has made the
leap to CD-ROM. Curious families everywhere want to know, ``How'd
they do it?''
</P>
<P>
   In this new Web site feature, the software giant lets everyone
in on the secret by unveiling ``Making of Blue's Birthday
Adventure.''
</P>
<P>
   This feature describes the process behind the collaboration
between Humongous Entertainment and Nickelodeon, which created the
interactive CD-ROM experience for preschoolers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Blue's Birthday Adventure'' combines the unique playability of
Humongous Entertainment's award-winning software with the rich look
and multilayered educational experience of the TV show. It will
have preschoolers going back for more.
</P>
<P>
   `Pajama Sam's Wacky
</P>
<P>
   Worldwide Weather Report'
</P>
<P>
   Kids recently discovered in ``Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and
Lightning Aren't So Frightening'' that weather across the globe is
amok and the world's youngest superhero is on a mission to fix it.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with its wacky weather online game, Humongous Entertainment
provides kids a chance to create their own newspapers based on
``Pajama Sam's Wacky Worldwide Weather Report.''
</P>
<P>
   Pajama Sam asks kids to provide him with the names of some of
their favorite things, including food, color and TV show, and then
places the answers into a weather story. Kids can check out and
print these stories as they would appear in the local newspaper.
With a variety of hand-drawn illustrations and one-of-a-kind
stories, kids will have a blast as they prepare their weather
report again and again.

   In print
</P>
<P>
   If there's one thing that's certain about PCs, it's that sooner
or later they break down. The October issue of PC World devotes its
cover story to how to figure out what's wrong and fix it. Better
yet, the issue offers tips on how to improve the performance of PCs
that are working. There are tips on such things as speeding up the
performance of your hard drive.
</P>
<P>
   The same issue of PC World also takes a look at the latest
generation of palmtop computers. Once again, 3Com's PalmPilot wins
top honors among the four handheld computers reviewed by PC World.
The magazine found it the fastest and easiest to use, although it
found plenty of room for improvement. In contrast, PC World found
the newest handheld computers using Windows CE to be sluggish and
complex.

 &HT;    Tiny organizer stands tall
 &HT;    By John Ghirardini
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of this century, bigger was better and biggest was
best, whether the topic was a new ocean liner or a record zucchini.
</P>
<P>
   But that course has been reversed in the digital age. Small now
stands tall.
</P>
<P>
   And nothing is standing taller than Franklin Electronic
Publishers' Rex Pro PC Card organizer, which the New Jersey company
bills as the world's smallest. The credit-card-size device, which
is only 1/4-inch thick, now has data entry and editing capability
for the road warrior on the go. The Pro will hold up to 6,000
records _ contacts, calendar, to-do lists and memos _ in its 512K
of RAM. It also includes both a home clock and world clock.
</P>
<P>
   The six-button organizer uses the SuperKey Light Data Entry
System to enter data directly, and TruSynch Plus software from
California-based Starfish Software for communicating with popular
personal information manager applications, such as Microsoft
Outlook 97/98, Lotus Organizer 97/97GS, Act!, Schedule+ and
Sidekick 98.
</P>
<P>
   Users can plug the 1.4-ounce Pro into a laptop's PC Card slot to
instantly access their PIM data, which is then displayed on the
LCD. A docking station connects to a desktop PC's serial port to
let the user instantly synchronize data.
</P>
<P>
   The device runs on a pair of lithium batteries good for six
months of normal use.
</P>
<P>
   The Pro retails for about $230, and includes the serial docking
station (three AAA batteries included) and a leather case.
</P>
<P>
   The butterfly effect
</P>
<P>
   Chaos.
</P>
<P>
   That's the opposite of what we expect of our digital servants,
which happily live in a world populated only by zeroes and ones and
excel at linear, either-or outlooks and solutions. To do this,
computers move electrical impulses along preordained, unvarying
circuits.
</P>
<P>
   Computers have a kinship with physics. There are very few
problems dealing with the regular movement of objects physicists
and mathematicians can't solve. These are described by what are
called ``linear equations,'' and mathematicians have been solving
such equations for hundreds of years.
</P>
<P>
   But there are other types of events physics has never been able
to handle, says mathematician Ian Malcolm _ turbulence, for
example. Water flowing out of a spigot. A leaf falling through the
air. Weather systems. Turbulent events are ``nonlinear equations.''
They're nearly impossible to solve. So physics came up with a
description about 10 years ago: ``chaos theory.''
</P>
<P>
   In a breakthrough that may not surprise those who have stared at
their computer screen in utter disbelief over a completely
unexpected result, physicists at Georgia Tech and the Institute of
Mathematical Sciences in Madras, India, have come up with a
computing technique that uses a network of chaotic elements to
``evolve'' an answer. The method was detailed in the Sept. 4 issue
of Georgia Tech Research News.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a glimpse of how we can make common dynamic systems
work for us in a way that's more like how we think the brain does
computation,'' said William L. Ditto, a physics professor at
Georgia Tech. ``It's an entirely new computing paradigm.''
</P>
<P>
   In a basic example, values of three and four would be encoded
into a system set with a critical value of one. The values would
create an imbalance that would ``avalanche'' through the chaotic
elements until it was ushered out of the system as the value of
seven. (If you don't completely follow that, don't fret. It is,
after all, chaos).
</P>
<P>
   Development of a practical system based on the paradigm is a
long way off, if it ever occurs, but stay tuned: When it comes to
something based on chaos theory, the next time a butterfly in the
Amazon rain forest flaps its wings, everything may change.
</P>
<P>
   They call it cyber-love
</P>
<P>
   Personal ads for singles have become a staple of the Internet,
and the site holding a sizable quiver of Cupid's arrows is
Dallas-based One &AMP; Only, according to Media Metrix, an online
audience measurement service.
</P>
<P>
   One &AMP; Only (http://oneandonly.com) offers singles a database of
romance profiles featuring 150,000 ads. The ad database is swept
monthly to remove bad e-mail addresses and make sure no duplicate
profiles are included.
</P>
<P>
   The service caters to singles seeking an upscale alternative to
the supermarket and bar scenes, the company says. The typical One &AMP;
Only user, according to the company, is a 35-year-old
college-educated white-collar professional. Placing an ad is free,
but to respond to romance profiles users can join the All You Can
E-Mail Club for as little as $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   The Rex Pro PC Card organizer will hold up to 6,000 records _
contacts, appointments, chores and errands _ in its 512K of RAM.

 &HT;    Some simple tweaking will make Windows 98 a bit more speedy
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   By now, many of you have a whole new set of problems.
</P>
<P>
   You have installed Windows 98.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. This isn't going to be a diatribe (well, I
will rant just a little) against Windows 98. For one thing, most PC
users have very little choice in the matter. It's unlikely that
most of you will choose to run IBM's OS/2, or an old version of
DOS, or (despite its merits) Unix. That leaves Windows. And if
you're going to run Windows anyway, you might as well use the
latest version.
</P>
<P>
   If you're like me, you spent several years tuning up Windows 95.
Things like that take a lot of time and a lot of tweaking. Now you
have _ residing like a fat and happy infant _ a brand new and
untweaked version of Windows. Truth is, many new users would be
better off living in peace with that plain vanilla version. This
tweaking stuff can be as dangerous as going to a barber nicknamed
Shakey.
</P>
<P>
   So think of these as speed tips for cowards. Simple stuff that
almost anyone can do without worry they'll end up with a computer
that doesn't compute. We won't discuss hardware tips today, since
we've already talked _ in earlier columns _ about the speed
benefits of adding more RAM or a better video card.
</P>
<P>
   First make sure you take advantage of the defragmenter utility
that comes with Windows 98. Earlier versions of Windows _ even the
last few versions of DOS _ included a defragmenter. But this one is
truly better. Like the earlier versions, it does its best to
assemble programs so that they are stored in one place on your hard
disk. That makes them run faster and more efficiently.
</P>
<P>
   But the Windows 98 version actually has some built-in
intelligence. It's smart enough to keep track of the programs you
run most frequently. And when you defragment the disk, it places
these most-often-used programs in areas of the hard disk that can
be accessed the fastest.
</P>
<P>
   The benefits of this sort of defragmenting come gradually. Over
time, as you continue to defragment the disk, programs are stored
most efficiently. Eventually the programs you use most often will
load and run the fastest. That comes at the expense, of course, of
speed for the programs you don't use as often. But it's a good
trade-off for most of us.
</P>
<P>
   The next thing to do is to take a good, hard look at your hard
disk. If it's nearly full, you can bet the lack of space is slowing
your PC. Here's why:
</P>
<P>
   Windows uses some of your free hard-disk space to temporarily
store information in a place called a swap file. This information
is swapped _ hence the name _ back and forth as it is needed. That
keeps the information handy and makes your computer run faster.
</P>
<P>
   But if the swap file is tiny, your PC is forced to limit the
amount of information it squirrels away and things get snail-slow.
Here's a general rule of thumb: Make sure the free space on your
hard disk is at least twice as big as the amount of RAM you have.
For instance, my home machine has 64 megabytes of RAM. That means
that _ at a bare minimum _ I need 128 megabytes of free hard disk
space. And up to a limit, more free space is even better.
</P>
<P>
   The next hint offers a slight sacrifice in display quality and a
giant improvement in speed for most folks. Use the Control Panel's
Display Properties box (right click on the desktop, select
Properties, then click on the tab that says Settings) to lower the
number of colors your monitor uses. Most programs won't look much
different when the 256-color setting is selected _ instead of
settings for High Color or True Color. (It's just as easy to set
the display colors back to use more colors when you need that sort
of display for working with photographs or playing some games.)

<P>
   One last display tip that you can use while that same Properties
window is open. Click on the Background tab and remove the check
mark, if it's found, from the setting called Animate windows, menus
and lists. This will also add some speed.
</P>
<P>
   That's it for today. We haven't turned Windows 98 into a hot
rod, but these tips do offer more speed at almost no risk.

   KELSO-COLUMN _ AUSTIN, Texas _ It's fitting that school
officials in this small town 30 miles east of Austin have decided

`STELLA' MAKERS APOLOGIZE TO HAITIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANCIE LATOUR  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Responding to a torrent of criticism from Haitians in the United
States and abroad, makers of the summer movie hit ``How Stella Got
Her Groove Back'' broke a no-comment silence this weekend and
apologized for an offending joke about Haitians and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   But it may be too little too late for Haitians still reeling
from a stigma they have long sought to bury and that they say their
black-American compatriots have now revived.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to a scene in the movie in which a character evokes a
long-held stereotype about Haiti as the birthplace of the HIV
virus, a spokeswoman for 20th Century Fox said in a statement that
``although the line was true to the character, we do understand the
insensitivity of her remark and apologize for any distress it has
caused.''
</P>
<P>
   The link between Haiti and AIDS reached its height in the 1980s.
The link was later medically disproven, and a US ban on Haitian
blood donations was lifted in 1990, but the misconception has lived
on in American popular culture.
</P>
<P>
   According to news reports, ``Stella'' director Kevin Sullivan
also said he will remove the scene from the movie's home-video
version.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement comes days after a Boston rally of 300 people
demonstrated outside City Hall.
</P>
<P>
   At the MTV Video Music Awards earlier this month, Haitian singer
and rapper Wyclef Jean denounced the joke before a TV audience of
millions.
</P>
<P>
   Jean, a member of the hip-hop band ``The Fugees'' and a
contributor to the movie's soundtrack, said he was ``saddened and
offended to see my country used as a brunt of an AIDS joke in the
movie.''
</P>
<P>
   The passing remark flashes by in a few quick seconds of the
feel-good summer romance, which stars Angela Bassett as a
40-something black-American stockbroker who heads for Jamaica and
finds love in a man half her age. When she returns, one of her
sisters ask her if she used a condom, ``because those people have a
history of AIDS.''
</P>
<P>
   Another sister interjects with the comment, ``No, that's Haiti,
Miss Manners.''
</P>
<P>
   After being frustrated by weeks of silence from the makers of
the film and from 20th Century Fox, some in Boston Sunday welcomed
news of the apology. But others said it was not enough to quiet the
outrage felt by Haitians nationwide, who remember the backlash of
discrimination, hate letters, and constant taunts they endured at
the height of the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   ``The news that the director is editing the movie, if it turns
out to be true, is one step toward doing justice to the issue of
AIDS and the Haitian people,'' said Pierre Imbert, who heads the
Haitian Multi-Service Center in Dorchester, Mass. ``But it is not
enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Imbert is part of a national coalition that demanded that 20th
Century Fox make a public apology, re-edit the film for video
release, and sponsor AIDS-related education programs.

COLOMBIA DIFFERS WITH THE US ON NARCO-WAR TACTICS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANA CARRIGAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Andres Pastrana, Colombia's new president, visits Capitol
Hill on Thursday, he will try to persuade congressional leaders not
to sabotage his government's courageous efforts to end 35 years of
civil war by negotiating with that country's guerrillas.
Lamentably, his chances of success are poor.
</P>
<P>
   Odds are that Pastrana's commitment to honor his overwhelming
mandate from the electorate to negotiate will again collide with
the only Colombian policy in town: US drug czar Barry McCaffrey's
counter-narcotics war. Only strong White House and State Department
leadership to rally bipartisan support for Colombia's peace
negotiations can avert a crisis now, and such support seems
unlikely.
</P>
<P>
   In the view of Congress, Pastrana's bold new policies are at
best unwelcome, at worst downright dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   Congress has only two things in mind when it focuses on
Colombia: drugs, and narco-guerrillas. Colombian coca and poppy
fields grow 80 percent of the cocaine and 60 percent of the heroin
that reaches the United States. McCaffrey, determined to cut off
drugs at the source, has declared war on the 200,000 peasants who
earn a living cultivating coca plants.
</P>
<P>
   Enter the narco-guerrilla, who shoots at the US spray planes
that carry out the crop fumigation strategy.
</P>
<P>
   McCaffrey's aerial crop eradication program in Colombia is the
most ambitious of its kind in Latin America. It has brought a war
of herbicides and helicopter gunships to the southern coca fields
and _ despite official denials to the contrary _ triggered the
rapid escalation of US involvement with the Colombian military in
the counterinsurgency war.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Congress overwhelmingly approved spending $208
million for helicopters and machine guns to help in the Colombian
anti-drug effort. And it went a step further: It said the money
would be offered only if the country's leadership does not pursue,
as part of its peace plan, the creation of a demilitarized zone in
the heart of the coca plantation region. It is that vote that
represents the gravest threat to Colombia's hopes for peace.
</P>
<P>
   Washington is confused by Pastrana. Politically and economically
conservative, a wealthy, free-market, pro-American, clean
politician, Pastrana appeared typecast for the role of ``Our man in
Bogota.'' But his refreshing independence on some of the most
sensitive issues has upset administration officials accustomed to
servile compliance with American demands. They expect of Pastrana
what they got from his weak, corrupt predecessor, Ernesto Samper,
and they are not getting it.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana's anti-narcotics chief has publicly characterized the
aerial spraying as a failure, and his environmental minister has
vetoed the environmentally hazardous herbicide Tebuthiuron from the
spraying program _ an addition that had been agreed to by Samper,
under pressure from the US ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is Washington pleased with Pastrana's six-hour meeting with
Cuban leader Fidel Castro at the recent nonaligned summit in
Durban, South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   The administration's most acute unhappiness, however, focuses on
Pastrana's commitment to demilitarize an area the size of El
Salvador in the heart of the coca plantations before initiating
talks with the guerrilla leadership in November. Even before
Congress moved to block the plan last week, according to one State
Department source, ``This peace process has frightened the heck out
of people here.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, this could be a watershed moment in Colombia's
relationship with the US. But somewhere between Bogota and
Washington, the promise, the complexity, and the enormity of what
is at stake for Colombia's 40 million people, and for US and
regional interests, was lost in translation.
</P>
<P>
   Once before, in the mid-1980s, a decade of partisan bitterness
in Congress over Central American policies was set aside in the
interest of supporting a bipartisan peace pact for the region.
Today, such leadership is again called for. Washington and Bogota
need to throw away the old model and reformulate their
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the United States is committed to heavy spending to
extend aerial crop eradication. Last year, 45,000 acres were
sprayed _ yet the acreage of coca plantations increased 18 percent
over the same period. Indeed, coca plantations have grown by 56
percent over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrana and most others realize the spraying program is a
catastrophe. Pastrana _ who believes that, under Colombia's
conditions, growing illicit crops is a social, not a criminal,
problem _ wants to institute a collaborative effort, based on
Colombian manpower and US money, to eradicate the coca plants by
hand, in collaboration with the growers. He would then offer them
long- and short-term economic development help as part of an
agrarian reform effort.
</P>
<P>
   At a first, historic meeting between Pastrana and the legendary
68-year-old guerrilla leader Manuel Marulanda, whose peasant army
has been at war with the state for 35 years, the army's leaders
repeated their desire to collaborate with the government to
eradicate illicit crops in return for development of alternative
sources of income for the peasant growers.
</P>
<P>
   In his inaugural address, Pastrana asked for international help
to finance a Marshall Plan to build schools, hospitals, and roads
and to develop microbusinesss to bring employment and economic
development to the areas where the drugs now flourish. Such a plan
is understandably attractive to the peasant army and the small
farmers they represent, who are tired of the violence and death
that come with an illegal drug trade.
</P>
<P>
   But US congressmen have not talked to Colombian coca farmers.
Instead, when they fly into the country on fact-finding missions,
they meet the Colombian police, US military advisers, and
intelligence staff who prop up the Colombian military.
</P>
<P>
   Without exposure to the population, they have made up their
minds to expand the failed US anti-drug program and to halt peace
negotiations. Washington's expanded counter-narcotics strategy will
continue to target narco-guerrillas, a composite enemy that
includes all those to whom Pastrana has given political status, and
whose identification has permitted the obliteration of the line
between counter-narcotics and counterinsurgency.

approval ratings have remained remarkably and consistently high.
The public has been saying clearly, for months, that it draws a
distinction between public policy and personal conduct, and sees
the Clinton affair to be a private matter between Bill and Hillary.

JAPANESE BANK LOSSES ARE BIGGEST COVER-UP EVER

<P>
   PARIS _ The losses suffered by Japan's banks as a result of bad
debts have now been revealed to be of a magnitude unapproached
since the Italians invented banking nearly 1,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The scope of the Japanese banking crisis is almost unimaginable
if Standard and Poor, the American agency that probes such matters,
is correct. And Standard and Poor doesn't often make mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the U.S. organization declared Japanese banks' bad
debts are probably as much as $1.1 billion _ nearly twice as great
as any Japanese official has ever acknowledged. Such a stupendous
figure would amount to nearly one-third of Japan's annual
production of goods and services. This makes losses incurred in the
American banking crisis of the 1980s look like small change.
</P>
<P>
   The implications are tremendous. First of all, the extent of the
losses means the task of rebuilding the country's finances, already
regarded as a tough job, will be herculean. Let's not forget that
it is Japan's banking troubles that are at the core of Asia's
economic turmoil, also contributing heavily to the doubts swirling
around Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that's only part of the disturbing story.
</P>
<P>
   Since the mid-1990s at the latest, government and financial
authorities in Japan must have had at least an inkling of the sizes
of the losses brought about mostly by a disastrous plunge in the
Japanese real estate market. But they systematically tried to hide
the scope of the crisis from the rest of the world and in the
cover-up were assisted by virtually every public and private
institution in the country. Only little by little were heavier
losses conceded _ when it became impossible to camouflage the
reality.
</P>
<P>
   The devastating consequence has been dangerous footdragging by
Japanese officials about how to deal with this dagger pointed at
the very heart of the world's second largest economy. Even today,
the arguments continue to rage. Government proposals to close the
weakest banks and inject public money into the others have run into
stiff opposition. Washington's pressure on Tokyo to get its act
together has had little appreciable effect.
</P>
<P>
   However, unless decisive action occurs soon, the current fears
of a global recession could be only a mild taste of what's to come.

 &HT;    
 By RICK MASHBURN 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway, a 469-mile Federal scenic highway
running between the Shenandoah National Park in Virginia and the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina, skirts the
eastern side of Asheville, N.C., for about 12 miles. But all signs
of the city's commerce and industry are obscured by hills and by
walls of rhododendron bushes.
 &HT;    Distracted drivers _ those with their eyes on autumn leaves, for
instance _ can easily pass the five Asheville exits without
realizing they have missed the largest city in western North
Carolina.
 &HT;    Asheville is particularly appealing in the fall, since it is
surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the eastern United
States, like the 6,684-foot Mount Mitchell, and is just minutes
away from protected wilderness areas and whitewater rivers. In
contrast, there is the Biltmore Estate, a 255-room mansion in the
style of a French chateau.
 &HT;    Asheville, population 67,000, is about 85 miles from the
southern end of the parkway. It makes a good stop for leaf watchers
who need replenishing, or a convenient base camp.
 &HT;    The downtown section, largely neglected for decades, is
undergoing a renaissance. The area has exceptional (and eccentric)
architecture, including Art Deco and Gothic Revival, and in the
past three years more than 20 buildings have been restored or
renovated. Once-empty storefronts house galleries with art,
antiques and the crafts of the region.
 &HT;    In the evenings, sidewalks fill with a mix of skateboarders and
window shoppers. You can hear blues on one side of the street and
bluegrass on the other.
 &HT;    More than a dozen downtown restaurants offer some form of
outdoor dining, including four side by side on Pack Square, three
of them so close that diners can pass a salt shaker from one
restaurant to the next.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The turning of the leaves begins with the red blush of dogwoods
and concludes with the russet tones of oaks. In late September
visitors will want to seek out higher elevations; those traveling
in early November should stick to valleys and lowlands. Foliage
conditions: (800) 280-0005.
 &HT;    Leaf watchers are not the only creatures flocking in. On clear
days thousands of migrating hawks have been seen following air
currents along the mountain ridges.
 &HT;    The privately owned Chimney Rock Park, 25 miles southeast of
Asheville on Highway 74A, will hold a hawk watch on Sept. 20. From
a rocky perch 1,200 feet above the valley floor, participants will
look for broad-winged, sharp-shinned and cooper's hawks.
 &HT;    An ornithologist will identify less frequent migrants: ospreys,
falcons and the occasional eagle. Admission to the park, $9.95 ($5
for children aged 6 to 16), includes an elevator ride to a gift
shop and a 75-mile view. It can be crowded at the top. Information:
(800) 277-9611.
 &HT;    A simple wooden folk toy is the center of attention at the 18th
annual Gee Haw Whimmy Diddle World Competition, Sept. 19 at the
Folk Art Center, mile 382 on the Blue Ridge Parkway (measured from
the northern end) just north of town.
 &HT;    A whimmy diddle consists of two sticks, one with a propeller
attached to one end, and the trick is to make the propeller spin by
rubbing one stick against the other.
 &HT;    Such traditional crafts as soap carving, blacksmithing and
basket weaving will be demonstrated on the grounds of the center,
which offers exhibits and a sales gallery year round. Free
admission; information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    Handicrafts both homespun and sophisticated will be sold at the
Southern Highland Craft Guild Fair, Oct. 15 to 18 at Asheville
Civic Center, 87 Haywood Street. About 150 crafts experts will
participate, all members of the guild, which was established in
1928 and also operates the Folk Art Center. Tickets are $5;
information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    ``In the City: Urban Vision 1900-1940,'' is an exhibition of 55
paintings by such artists as Edward Hopper, Reginald Marsh and John
Sloan. The pictures are on display through Oct. 31 at the Asheville
Art Museum in Pack Place, 2 Pack Square, and are on loan from the
Whitney Museum of American Art. Admission, $5; information, (828)
253-3227.
 &HT;    The work of the city's own artists can be viewed during the City
Center Arts Walk, which is held every other month, the next one on
the evening of Nov. 6. Twenty-four downtown galleries and studios
will be open for crowds who come for the art, the street performers
and the festive atmosphere. Free; information, (828) 258-0710.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway has unblemished views of valleys and
ridges and provides frequent overlooks. Between miles 363 and 369,
about 25 miles north of
 &HT;    Asheville, Craggy Gardens offers trails and picnic areas.
Another eight miles north is the entrance to Mount Mitchell State
Park, where visitors can climb a stone tower to admire a stunning
360-degree view.
 &HT;    When a new road opens on Oct. 24, parkway travelers will have
direct access to the North Carolina Arboretum at mile 393 just
south of Asheville. For now, drivers must follow signs from State
Route 191.
 &HT;    The arboretum showcases native flora in informal plantings and
distinctive theme gardens. Free; grounds open daily from 8 a.m. to
9 p.m. Information, (828) 665-2492.
 &HT;    Cold Mountain is attracting increased attention after giving its
name to Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of Civil War days.
Visible from the overlook near parkway mile 412, the peak is strong
but hardly spectacular, especially when compared with Looking Glass
Rock, the dramatic granite dome that comes into view from the
parkway a few miles farther south.
 &HT;    Asheville's best-known literary landmark, Thomas Wolfe's boyhood
home, was badly damaged in a fire on July 24 and is expected to be
closed for several years. The site's new visitors center, at 52
Market St., remains open and is well worth a trip, with its
well-designed displays, among them the contents of Wolfe's last New
York apartment. Admission is free; open Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.; Sunday 1 to 5. Information, (828) 253-8304.
 &HT;    F. Scott Fitzgerald visited the city frequently during the
1930's and always stayed in Room 441 of the Grove Park Inn. He
liked the room because it overlooked the courtyard and he preferred
observing people to mountains.
 &HT;    This year the hotel restored the room to look as it did during
his visits, outfitting it with vintage telephone and radio and
Fitzgerald memorablilia. The room can be viewed when unoccupied, or
you can stay there yourself for $185 for two, $195 on weekends.
 &HT;    A thorough tour of the Biltmore estate, (800) 543-2961, with its
chateau, winery and 75 acres of gardens, can take the better part
of a day, yet it is not easy to leave anything out.
 &HT;    The basement, which is a recreation area with two bowling alleys
and a swimming pool, is as fascinating to some as the main floors,
where spacious rooms house fine furniture, paintings, 16th-century
tapestries, and carvings in stone and wood.
 &HT;    Admission is $29.95 a person ($22.50 for children aged 10 to 15;
free for 9 and under). The estate is open daily, the house from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m., the grounds from 8:30 a.m. to dusk, and the winery
from 11 to 7. All are likely to be busy on weekends, and almost
certainly during leaf season, particularly in October.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Beds are at a premium during leaf season, especially on
weekends; reservations are essential. Prices do not include a 9
percent tax.
 &HT;    The shady and historic Montford Park neighborhood, just north of
downtown, has a dozen bed-and-breakfast inns within a six-block
area. Most are in fine old houses, and many have pleasant gardens.
 &HT;    The Lion and the Rose, 276 Montford Ave., (828) 255-7673, fax
(828) 285-9810, dates back to 1895. This neoclassical house has
four guest rooms and one suite, all furnished with antiques and
queen-size beds. A room for two ranges from $115 to $165; the
suite, $195.
 &HT;    The Radisson Hotel, 1 Thomas Wolfe Plaza, (800) 438-3960, fax
(828) 254-1374, is in the heart of downtown. Its 12 stories of
glass and steel do not add character to the city, but the 281 rooms
are comfortable, and some have a view of the mountains. A double is
$99 to $149.
 &HT;    Budget: Many of the city's less expensive hotels and motels can
be found on busy Tunnel Road. Days Inn Central, 199 Tunnel Road,
(828) 254-4311, fax (704) 258-3970, is near the Asheville Mall, the
city's biggest shopping center. The inn has 77 rooms; doubles are
$59 to $79.
 &HT;    Luxury: Richmond Hill Inn, 87 Richmond Hill Drive; (888)
742-4540, fax (828) 252-8726, started out with rooms in a mansion
built in 1889. The inn has been expanded with nine one-room
cottages built around a croquet green, and the newest addition (in
1996), the garden pavilion, with guest rooms and a restaurant for
groups. There are 36 rooms and suites in all, many with fireplaces.
Most, particularly in the main house, are furnished in Victorian
style. Rates for a double room, $135 to $375, include a full
breakfast and afternoon tea.
 &HT;    Grove Park Inn, 290 Macon Ave., (800) 438-5800, fax (828)
252-6102, has also grown considerably over the years. With two
modern wings, it now has 510 rooms and is a resort with golf, a
comprehensive sports facility, three restaurants and a nightclub.
The rooms are furnished in the Arts and Crafts style that evolved
from the turn of the century to the 1920s. Doubles: $185 to $235.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At the Market Place, 20 Wall St., (828) 252-4162, fall brings
apples, one of the chef's favorite foods. They turn up in soups,
salads, and desserts and in such entrees as trout stuffed with
apple and bacon, and salmon with a red onion and apple crust. The
decor, which is contemporary, includes stainless steel and marble
walls. Dinner for two, with a modest wine, is about $90, not
including tax and tip.
 &HT;    La Caterina Trattoria, 5 Pack Square, (828) 254-1148, has the
feel and the flavors of Italy. It's in a building that is more than
100 years old and has high ceilings plastered with posters, and
small white tiles on floor and walls. Sausages, some pastas and the
mozzarella are made on the premises. Osso buco and braciole are
among the entrees. Outdoor and indoor dining. Dinner for two with
wine is about $75.
 &HT;    The Laughing Seed Cafe, 40 Wall St., (828) 252-3445, has an
eclectic look with a fantasy Caribbean mural stretching the length
of one wall, as well as local quilts. It offers satisfying
vegetarian variations of such traditional foods as the sloppy Joe,
Reuben sandwich and New Orleans muffaletta. Dinner specialties
include Thai green curry and pesto penne primavera. Dinner for two
with beer from the microbrewery in the basement is about $30.
 &HT;    ``Colorful'' does not adequately describe Salsas, 6 Patton
Avenue, (828) 252-9805, a tiny place with Day-Glo decor and wild
Mexican and Caribbean cuisine. One salsa is made with smoked ancho
chiles, cinnamon and charred tomatillos; another has mango, carrot
and habanero pepper. Improbable combinations _ a taco with smoked
trout, eggplant and plantain _ usually manage to please. Always
jammed, but that is part of the fun. Dinner for two, with beer, is
about $25.

undergoing a renaissance. The area has exceptional (and eccentric)
architecture, including Art Deco and Gothic Revival, and in the
past three years more than 20 buildings have been restored or
renovated. Once-empty storefronts house galleries with art,
antiques and the crafts of the region.
 &HT;    In the evenings, sidewalks fill with a mix of skateboarders and
window shoppers. You can hear blues on one side of the street and
bluegrass on the other.
 &HT;    More than a dozen downtown restaurants offer some form of
outdoor dining, including four side by side on Pack Square, three
of them so close that diners can pass a salt shaker from one
restaurant to the next.
 EVENTS  
 &HT;    The turning of the leaves begins with the red blush of dogwoods
and concludes with the russet tones of oaks. In late September
visitors will want to seek out higher elevations; those traveling
in early November should stick to valleys and lowlands. Foliage
conditions: (800) 280-0005.
 &HT;    Leaf watchers are not the only creatures flocking in. On clear
days thousands of migrating hawks have been seen following air
currents along the mountain ridges.
 &HT;    The privately owned Chimney Rock Park, 25 miles southeast of
Asheville on Highway 74A, will hold a hawk watch on Sept. 20. From
a rocky perch 1,200 feet above the valley floor, participants will
look for broad-winged, sharp-shinned and cooper's hawks.
 &HT;    An ornithologist will identify less frequent migrants: ospreys,
falcons and the occasional eagle. Admission to the park, $9.95 ($5
for children aged 6 to 16), includes an elevator ride to a gift
shop and a 75-mile view. It can be crowded at the top. Information:
(800) 277-9611.
 &HT;    A simple wooden folk toy is the center of attention at the 18th
annual Gee Haw Whimmy Diddle World Competition, Sept. 19 at the
Folk Art Center, mile 382 on the Blue Ridge Parkway (measured from
the northern end) just north of town.
 &HT;    A whimmy diddle consists of two sticks, one with a propeller
attached to one end, and the trick is to make the propeller spin by
rubbing one stick against the other.
 &HT;    Such traditional crafts as soap carving, blacksmithing and
basket weaving will be demonstrated on the grounds of the center,
which offers exhibits and a sales gallery year round. Free
admission; information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    Handicrafts both homespun and sophisticated will be sold at the
Southern Highland Craft Guild Fair, Oct. 15 to 18 at Asheville
Civic Center, 87 Haywood Street. About 150 crafts experts will
participate, all members of the guild, which was established in
1928 and also operates the Folk Art Center. Tickets are $5;
information, (828) 298-7928.
 &HT;    ``In the City: Urban Vision 1900-1940,'' is an exhibition of 55
paintings by such artists as Edward Hopper, Reginald Marsh and John
Sloan. The pictures are on display through Oct. 31 at the Asheville
Art Museum in Pack Place, 2 Pack Square, and are on loan from the
Whitney Museum of American Art. Admission, $5; information, (828)
253-3227.
 &HT;    The work of the city's own artists can be viewed during the City
Center Arts Walk, which is held every other month, the next one on
the evening of Nov. 6. Twenty-four downtown galleries and studios
will be open for crowds who come for the art, the street performers
and the festive atmosphere. Free; information, (828) 258-0710.
 SIGHTSEEING  
 &HT;    The Blue Ridge Parkway has unblemished views of valleys and
ridges and provides frequent overlooks. Between miles 363 and 369,
about 25 miles north of
 &HT;    Asheville, Craggy Gardens offers trails and picnic areas.
Another eight miles north is the entrance to Mount Mitchell State
Park, where visitors can climb a stone tower to admire a stunning
360-degree view.
 &HT;    When a new road opens on Oct. 24, parkway travelers will have
direct access to the North Carolina Arboretum at mile 393 just
south of Asheville. For now, drivers must follow signs from State
Route 191.
 &HT;    The arboretum showcases native flora in informal plantings and
distinctive theme gardens. Free; grounds open daily from 8 a.m. to
9 p.m. Information, (828) 665-2492.
 &HT;    Cold Mountain is attracting increased attention after giving its
name to Charles Frazier's best-selling novel of Civil War days.
Visible from the overlook near parkway mile 412, the peak is strong
but hardly spectacular, especially when compared with Looking Glass
Rock, the dramatic granite dome that comes into view from the
parkway a few miles farther south.
 &HT;    Asheville's best-known literary landmark, Thomas Wolfe's boyhood
home, was badly damaged in a fire on July 24 and is expected to be
closed for several years. The site's new visitors center, at 52
Market St., remains open and is well worth a trip, with its
well-designed displays, among them the contents of Wolfe's last New
York apartment. Admission is free; open Monday to Saturday, 9 a.m.
to 5 p.m.; Sunday 1 to 5. Information, (828) 253-8304.
 &HT;    F. Scott Fitzgerald visited the city frequently during the
1930's and always stayed in Room 441 of the Grove Park Inn. He
liked the room because it overlooked the courtyard and he preferred
observing people to mountains.
 &HT;    This year the hotel restored the room to look as it did during
his visits, outfitting it with vintage telephone and radio and
Fitzgerald memorablilia. The room can be viewed when unoccupied, or
you can stay there yourself for $185 for two, $195 on weekends.
 &HT;    A thorough tour of the Biltmore estate, (800) 543-2961, with its
chateau, winery and 75 acres of gardens, can take the better part
of a day, yet it is not easy to leave anything out.
 &HT;    The basement, which is a recreation area with two bowling alleys
and a swimming pool, is as fascinating to some as the main floors,
where spacious rooms house fine furniture, paintings, 16th-century
tapestries, and carvings in stone and wood.
 &HT;    Admission is $29.95 a person ($22.50 for children aged 10 to 15;
free for 9 and under). The estate is open daily, the house from 9
a.m. to 6 p.m., the grounds from 8:30 a.m. to dusk, and the winery
from 11 to 7. All are likely to be busy on weekends, and almost
certainly during leaf season, particularly in October.
 WHERE TO STAY  
 &HT;    Beds are at a premium during leaf season, especially on
weekends; reservations are essential. Prices do not include a 9
percent tax.
 &HT;    The shady and historic Montford Park neighborhood, just north of
downtown, has a dozen bed-and-breakfast inns within a six-block
area. Most are in fine old houses, and many have pleasant gardens.
 &HT;    The Lion and the Rose, 276 Montford Ave., (828) 255-7673, fax
(828) 285-9810, dates back to 1895. This neoclassical house has
four guest rooms and one suite, all furnished with antiques and
queen-size beds. A room for two ranges from $115 to $165; the
suite, $195.
 &HT;    The Radisson Hotel, 1 Thomas Wolfe Plaza, (800) 438-3960, fax
(828) 254-1374, is in the heart of downtown. Its 12 stories of
glass and steel do not add character to the city, but the 281 rooms
are comfortable, and some have a view of the mountains. A double is
$99 to $149.
 &HT;    Budget: Many of the city's less expensive hotels and motels can
be found on busy Tunnel Road. Days Inn Central, 199 Tunnel Road,
(828) 254-4311, fax (704) 258-3970, is near the Asheville Mall, the
city's biggest shopping center. The inn has 77 rooms; doubles are
$59 to $79.
 &HT;    Luxury: Richmond Hill Inn, 87 Richmond Hill Drive; (888)
742-4540, fax (828) 252-8726, started out with rooms in a mansion
built in 1889. The inn has been expanded with nine one-room
cottages built around a croquet green, and the newest addition (in
1996), the garden pavilion, with guest rooms and a restaurant for
groups. There are 36 rooms and suites in all, many with fireplaces.
Most, particularly in the main house, are furnished in Victorian
style. Rates for a double room, $135 to $375, include a full
breakfast and afternoon tea.
 &HT;    Grove Park Inn, 290 Macon Ave., (800) 438-5800, fax (828)
252-6102, has also grown considerably over the years. With two
modern wings, it now has 510 rooms and is a resort with golf, a
comprehensive sports facility, three restaurants and a nightclub.
The rooms are furnished in the Arts and Crafts style that evolved
from the turn of the century to the 1920s. Doubles: $185 to $235.
 WHERE TO EAT  
 &HT;    At the Market Place, 20 Wall St., (828) 252-4162, fall brings
apples, one of the chef's favorite foods. They turn up in soups,
salads, and desserts and in such entrees as trout stuffed with
apple and bacon, and salmon with a red onion and apple crust. The
decor, which is contemporary, includes stainless steel and marble
walls. Dinner for two, with a modest wine, is about $90, not
including tax and tip.
 &HT;    La Caterina Trattoria, 5 Pack Square, (828) 254-1148, has the
feel and the flavors of Italy. It's in a building that is more than
100 years old and has high ceilings plastered with posters, and
small white tiles on floor and walls. Sausages, some pastas and the
mozzarella are made on the premises. Osso buco and braciole are
among the entrees. Outdoor and indoor dining. Dinner for two with
wine is about $75.
 &HT;    The Laughing Seed Cafe, 40 Wall St., (828) 252-3445, has an
eclectic look with a fantasy Caribbean mural stretching the length
of one wall, as well as local quilts. It offers satisfying
vegetarian variations of such traditional foods as the sloppy Joe,
Reuben sandwich and New Orleans muffaletta. Dinner specialties
include Thai green curry and pesto penne primavera. Dinner for two
with beer from the microbrewery in the basement is about $30.
 &HT;    ``Colorful'' does not adequately describe Salsas, 6 Patton
Avenue, (828) 252-9805, a tiny place with Day-Glo decor and wild
Mexican and Caribbean cuisine. One salsa is made with smoked ancho
chiles, cinnamon and charred tomatillos; another has mango, carrot
and habanero pepper. Improbable combinations _ a taco with smoked
trout, eggplant and plantain _ usually manage to please. Always
jammed, but that is part of the fun. Dinner for two, with beer, is
about $25.

 &HT;    
 By GENE AND ADELE MALOTT 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    On the second day of their cruise-tour through Alaska, Robert F.
Reiland rushed his wife who was suffering from a life-threatening
breathing problem to a hospital emergency room in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    After four days of intensive care, Mrs. Reiland had recovered
enough to return home to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla., ending the
couple's journey. At the time they wrote us, they had received no
refunds for the portion of the trip that had to be cancelled, for
hotel bills in Fairbanks and for extra airfare _ not a penny from
the tour operator, their travel agent or the airline.
 &HT;    As Reiland says, ``We paid $11,000 up front for what became only
a round-trip to Alaska and a riverboat ride ...''
 &HT;    The truth is that the Reilands hadn't bought trip insurance. In
fact, they didn't even know such a thing existed. And, apparently,
their travel agent didn't tell them, either. As a result, nobody
was required to refund the Reilands' money.
 &HT;    With more mature travelers taking longer and more expensive
vacations, trip insurance is becoming a necessity to protect a
fairly large travel investment _ and it provides peace of mind.
 &HT;    A typical policy costs only 5 percent to 6 percent of the cost
of the trip; some policies cost less. Rates seem to be lower than
they were several years ago, and coverages are better as insurance
vendors expand their claims experience.
 &HT;    On the downside, leading trip-insurance sellers are beginning to
charge rates based on age _ the older you are, the more trip
insurance costs. The higher cost is also a result of the greater
number of claims filed by mature travelers, who have more
experience travelling.
 &HT;    For example, a policy from CSA Travel Protection will insure a
$2,500 trip for a premium of $69 if you are under 55, $105 if you
are 56 to 70, and $135 if you are 70 or older. Even so, those
premiums are a bargain compared with the costs of travel that
aren't reimbursed.
 COVERING THE BIG COSTS  
 &HT;    Make sure you are covered for loses you can't afford to absorb,
and try not to pay high prices for other frills. Make sure, too,
that the policy you choose is an insurance policy and not just an
add-on to a trip offered as an afterthought.
 &HT;    Nancy Hoyt Belcher of Oakland, Calif., was on a trip to Alaska's
Denali Wilderness Retreat on a remote back corner of the national
park, a place where there are no roads, when she suffered a heart
attack. Bad weather prevented a plane from getting in, so she was
helicoptered to the nearest hospital in Fairbanks.
 &HT;    But Fairbanks had no cardiology unit, so she was airlifted to
Anchorage, where she recuperated. Belcher says the bill for that
relatively short evacuation was more than $9,000. Some evacuations
from remote corners of the world to decent hospitals can cost up to
$25,000.
 &HT;    Your insurance policy should cover the following:
 &HT;     _ TRIP CANCELLATION OR INTERRUPTION: This is the primary reason
for all trip-insurance policies. It comes into play when: the death
or serious illness of you, your traveling companion or a close
relative at home requires you to cancel your trip and to stay home;
you have an emergency at home, like a flood or an earthquake; you
miss connections and can't pick up the trip; the ship is disabled
on a cruise the week before yours; your cruise is cancelled; and
your tour operator goes broke and you are stranded overseas.
 &HT;    Insurance reimbursement should cover the cruise fare or cost of
a tour that won't be refunded, any extra meals or lodging bills and
any airfare add-ons to fly home early.
 &HT;     _ EVACUATION:  Emergency medical evacuation insurance (EME) is
also a feature of most trip-insurance policies. Claim it when you
have an illness too serious to be treated on the spot and you must
be airlifted from some remote location to a hospital where you can
get proper care, or you need additional evacuation to a hospital
near your home.
 &HT;    Although evacuation is rarely necessary, it is about the most
expensive thing that can go wrong on a trip _ up to $25,000 for a
long-distance airlift. Clearly, this is an expense most travelers
can't absorb.
 &HT;     _ MEDICAL EXPENSES:  While extra medical or dental expenses may
be covered by your existing health-insurance policies, you should
check your policy to make sure you're covered outside the United
States.
 &HT;    If you've purchased Part B coverage, Medicare will probably
cover expensive options such as medical evacuation under its
provisions for ambulance services _ but only in the United States.
 &HT;    Beware: Medicare does not cover most health-threatening
situations that happen to you outside the country. So you'll need
this supplemental medical/dental coverage when you're traveling
abroad.
 &HT;     _ EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE: Does the policy provide medical
referral to English-speaking doctors overseas (preferably using a
telephone hotline), translation by phone, medical monitoring in a
foreign hospital, prescription help, emergency cash to pay foreign
hospital bills and possible legal assistance?
 &HT;    What you don't need in a trip-insurance policy are items often
already covered by your existing policies or those whose cost you
can handle: for example, coverage for lost or delayed luggage, lost
passports or travelers checks, accidental death or dismemberment,
accident insurance on a rental car.
 &HT;    And make sure you read your policy when you receive it and
understand your coverage. You may want to shop further.
 &HT;    Here are leading companies that provide trip insurance for
mature travelers. All basic policies from these companies provide
coverage for trip cancellation, medical evacuation, extra medical
costs and emergency services:
 &HT;     _ Access America,  (800) 284-8300.
 &HT;     _ American Express,  (800) 758-2639.
 &HT;     _ Berkeley Carefree,  (800) 323-3149.
 &HT;     _ CSA,  (800)348-9505.
 &HT;     _ TravelGuard,  (800) 826-1300.
 &HT;     _ Travelers,  (800) 243-3174.
 &HT;    Of these, ``Consumer Reports Travel Letter'' rated CSA and
Access America policies as best values.
 &HT;    Buy a trip-insurance policy from your travel agent at the time
you book the trip _ most agencies can set you up with these
companies _ or directly from the insurance provider.

be airlifted from some remote location to a hospital where you can
get proper care, or you need additional evacuation to a hospital
near your home.
 &HT;    Although evacuation is rarely necessary, it is about the most
expensive thing that can go wrong on a trip _ up to $25,000 for a
long-distance airlift. Clearly, this is an expense most travelers
can't absorb.
 &HT;     _ MEDICAL EXPENSES:  While extra medical or dental expenses may
be covered by your existing health-insurance policies, you should
check your policy to make sure you're covered outside the United
States.
 &HT;    If you've purchased Part B coverage, Medicare will probably
cover expensive options such as medical evacuation under its
provisions for ambulance services _ but only in the United States.
 &HT;    Beware: Medicare does not cover most health-threatening
situations that happen to you outside the country. So you'll need
this supplemental medical/dental coverage when you're traveling
abroad.
 &HT;     _ EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE: Does the policy provide medical
referral to English-speaking doctors overseas (preferably using a
telephone hotline), translation by phone, medical monitoring in a
foreign hospital, prescription help, emergency cash to pay foreign
hospital bills and possible legal assistance?
 &HT;    What you don't need in a trip-insurance policy are items often
already covered by your existing policies or those whose cost you
can handle: for example, coverage for lost or delayed luggage, lost
passports or travelers checks, accidental death or dismemberment,
accident insurance on a rental car.
 &HT;    And make sure you read your policy when you receive it and
understand your coverage. You may want to shop further.
 &HT;    Here are leading companies that provide trip insurance for
mature travelers. All basic policies from these companies provide
coverage for trip cancellation, medical evacuation, extra medical
costs and emergency services:
 &HT;     _ Access America,  (800) 284-8300.
 &HT;     _ American Express,  (800) 758-2639.
 &HT;     _ Berkeley Carefree,  (800) 323-3149.
 &HT;     _ CSA,  (800)348-9505.
 &HT;     _ TravelGuard,  (800) 826-1300.
 &HT;     _ Travelers,  (800) 243-3174.
 &HT;    Of these, ``Consumer Reports Travel Letter'' rated CSA and
Access America policies as best values.
 &HT;    Buy a trip-insurance policy from your travel agent at the time
you book the trip _ most agencies can set you up with these
companies _ or directly from the insurance provider.

 By EVERETT POTTER 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    The British Royal Family has made its share of gaffes and has
taken its share of knocks in recent years, most memorably when
Diana, Princess of Wales, died last August. So it's refreshing to
take note of one member of the extended Royal Family who's making a
good name for himself _ and his country in the process.
 &HT;    ``I'm very fortunate to be related to certain people'' James
Ogilvy says with characteristic modesty. Ogilvy is the 34-year-old
publisher and editor of the recently launched newsletter,
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland: The Insider Guide for the
Sophisticated Traveller.''
 &HT;    He also happens to be the son of H.R.H. Princess Alexandra, the
Hon. Lady Ogilvy, herself a first cousin to H.M. Queen Elizabeth
II. That makes James Ogilvy the 30th in line for the crown. He's
hardly up there with Prince William and Prince Harry, but he's a
Royal nonetheless.
 &HT;    Unlike some of his splashier relatives, Ogilvy lives out of the
spotlight in a small Scottish village not far from St. Andrews,
with his wife Julia and their children, Julia and James. It's a
quiet life but noteworthy enough to make the cover of Town &AMP;
Country in August 1997.
 &HT;    But for fans of Britain and Ireland, what's more important is
that Ogilvy has poured his love for his homeland and his expertise
in the luxury-goods field into this newsletter.
 &HT;    ``I've always been interested in newsletters, which are almost
completely unknown in Europe but big in the United States,'' Ogilvy
says from his 18th-century house with a view of the sea. ``But I
had never come across a newsletter about Britain, which I think is
a big omission.''
 &HT;    Especially given the fact that the British Tourist Authority is
projecting that a record 3.8 million Americans will go to Britain
this year.
 &HT;    Thankfully, Ogilvy already has a track record in the publishing
business. After spending four years as an investment banker and
then four years directing a shipping company, the MBA-wielding
Royal launched ``Luxury Briefing'' in October 1996.
 &HT;    This 16-page trade publication focuses on key events in the
luxury industry throughout the United States and Britain. Now it's
``Ogilvy's Britain and Ireland,'' which is squarely aimed at
affluent Americans.
 &HT;    ``We have something to say,'' Ogilvy explains. ``There's a lot
of information that we already had. We're quite well plugged in.''
 &HT;    The 12-page newsletter, now in its second issue, is as crisp and
well-organized as a good travel magazine. Each issue highlights
three London hotel properties.
 &HT;    In the first issue, properties such as The Hyde Park, The
Athenaeum and the Covent Garden Hotel are singled out.
 &HT;    Each issue also talks about hotels outside London, such as The
Clarence in Dublin and Chewton Glen in Hampshire. There are
features on London's hottest restaurants, on restaurants outside
London and on London shopping districts such as Westbourne Village.
 &HT;    There's also a feature on golf in each issue and a piece on
``Great British Institutions.'' In the first issue, it's about tea.
In the second, it's on bespoke tailoring.
 &HT;    What's best about it, perhaps, is the added attention to detail
_ to driving directions, airport, theater and museum information,
and even VAT refunds.
 &HT;    This is not for would-be Royals heading to Buckingham Palace.
It's for Anglophiles eager for insider news about where to eat, to
shop and to lay their heads at night. The prose is breezy, bright
and friendly, fitting for a newsletter for enthusiasts about all
things British, with a discrete nod to the Irish.
 &HT;    ``I think that as long as you're honest about a place, you can
lay it out for someone else to make their judgement,'' Ogilvy says.
 &HT;    An American enthusiast, he'd just returned from a two-week
summer vacation on the island of Nantucket.
 &HT;    ``I absolutely adore America,'' he says. ``I've got a lot of
very good American friends and I think I understand what Americans
enjoy. Unlike France or Italy or Spain, which are in or out of
fashion, Britain has a peculiar ongoing relationship with the
United States. So many Americans have links back here.''
 &HT;    The newsletter, which is priced at $100 a year, is a product
that Ogilvy hopes will have ``a clublike feel. I think someone like
Andrew Harper of 'The Hideaway Report' has done a tremendous job,
and I'd be very happy if we could emulate some of his success.''
 &HT;    Throughout the newsletter are ``Best-Kept Secrets'' such as
Cliveden Town House hotel in London and the Nefyn and District Golf
Club in Wales.
 &HT;    Does being a Royal give Ogilvy's newsletter special insight?
 &HT;    ``It doesn't necessarily give a particular slant to it,'' he
says. ``But I hope that my own experience and my own exposure to a
lot of the business we're writing about comes through. It's a
personal interpretation of what I feel are some great places. I
just hope people will not be disappointed.''
 &HT;    A one-year, six-issue subscription is $100. For a free sample
issue, contact ``Ogilvy's Britain &AMP; Ireland: The Insider Guide for
the Sophisticated Traveller,'' Coates House, Upper Largo, Fife, KY8
6JF, Scotland (888-OGILVYS/www.ogilvys-britain.com).

 &HT;    TELECOM MERGERS IRK LAWMAKERS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories for
release Sunday, Sept. 27.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Has the urge to merge in the phone business cut off
the fuel to duel? That's the view of some key legislators and
government regulators who see the ghost of old Ma Bell rising anew.
</P>
<P>
   ``I fear that concentration of ownership in the
telecommunications industry is currently proceeding faster than the
growth of competition,'' said Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, the
ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee. ``We are seeing
old monopolies getting bigger and expanding their reach.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, concern over how telecom mergers will affect both
business users and consumers extends across party lines. A fresh
legislative look at the entire telecommunications law is likely
when the next Congress meets in January, with at least one chamber,
and perhaps both, still expected to be under Republican control.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consolidation was hardly an issue in 1996 when the
lawmakers approved the landmark legislation. At the time, the act's
chief purposes were said to be fostering competition, cutting
regulations and speeding the adoption of such new technologies as
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After holding four hearings on telecom developments before his
Senate antitrust subcommittee, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said this
month: ``We need to take a serious look at the Telecommunications
Act to decide how well it is working, how long we should stay with
it and what might be done to improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision in the 1980s to break up the Ma Bell monopoly left
AT&AMP;T Corp. as the nation's prime long-distance provider while
creating seven regional phone companies to offer local service. But
since passage of the 1996 act, the telecom landscape has undergone
seismic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel into SBC Corp. and Bell
Atlantic has merged with Nynex. SBC is now seeking to merge with
Ameritech while Bell Atlantic wants to hook up with GTE, the
remaining large local phone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Even as all this takes place, local competitors still serve
barely 1 percent of the Bells' 178 million residential customers.
And phone rates continue to rise in most states, propelled in part
by ``universal service'' fees mandated by Congress and federal
regulators to subsidize underserved customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, AT&AMP;T has spent more than $5 billion seeking, mostly in
vain, to enter local phone markets. In June, the company took a new
tack by moving to acquire Tele-Communications Inc. for about $32
billion. By linking to consumers through TCI's cable system, which
reaches 10.5 million homes, AT&AMP;T intends to bypass the Bells'
copper and fiber networks.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of these moves, the Federal Communications
Commission approved WorldCom's purchase of MCI, another major
long-distance provider, thereby removing the last hurdle for
completion of the $40 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard praises the merger, saying that the
combined company is committed to provide telecom services to
residential areas, ``including our nation's inner cities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennard also said that ``our applause for this combination
should be restrained'' because ``once this merger is consummated,
the industry will again be poised just a merger away from undue
concentration. I dare say that any subsequent merger _ of this or
similar magnitude _ between long-distance firms in the near future
should be judged quite differently than the merger before us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As these mergers occur, the 1996 overall master plan has yet to
jell. Under that plan, long-distance carriers, local phone
companies, cable companies and Internet service providers were
supposed to freely trample through each other's turf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some pieces are starting to fall into place, despite
legal roadblocks raised by many of the players _ impediments which
have yet to be fully tested in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ameritech, the Midwestern Bell giant, is making some headway
in the cable business, while Cox Cable, among others, now provides
local dial tones in such large cities as Phoenix and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bell Atlantic appears close to entering the long-distance
market in New York.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An explosion of telecommunications activity is taking place
via the Internet, where voice and high-speed data exchanges are
increasingly available as stand-alone services.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry figures claim that the open protocols that power
the Internet will soon make distinctions such as ``local'' and
``long distance,'' ``voice'' and ``data,'' ``telephone'' and
``computer'' obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The need to ``enable the delivery of multiple services by
multiple
</P>
<P>
   suppliers'' is the driving force behind the proposed Bell
Atlantic-GTE link, Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's president,
recently told DeWine's antitrust panel.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the deal as ``a pro-competitive response to the
</P>
<P>
   revolutionary changes overtaking the telecommunications
industry,'' Seidenberg noted that annual double-digit growth in
telecommunications equipment and services is expected to continue
through 2001. By then, he predicted, communications will be a $1
trillion industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this growth is coming from sources we could never have
</P>
<P>
   predicted a few years ago, most notably the explosive demand for
high-speed data services,'' Seidenberg said. Data traffic now
doubles every three months, as opposed to every 12 years for voice
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some lawmakers remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Have patience,' we are told,'' said Sen. Sen. Herb Kohl,
D-Wis. `` 'The act is working, but it will take some time for
competition to take root and grow.' Well, there may be some truth
to this notion, but unless we see more tangible evidence that
consumers have real choices, the pressure will continue to re-open
the act and break the stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   IN the meantime, Kohl and DeWine plan to ask the General
Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, to investigate
competitive trends in the phone industry.

<P>
   Moreover, concern over how telecom mergers will affect both
business users and consumers extends across party lines. A fresh
legislative look at the entire telecommunications law is likely
when the next Congress meets in January, with at least one chamber,
and perhaps both, still expected to be under Republican control.
</P>
<P>
   Industry consolidation was hardly an issue in 1996 when the
lawmakers approved the landmark legislation. At the time, the act's
chief purposes were said to be fostering competition, cutting
regulations and speeding the adoption of such new technologies as
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   After holding four hearings on telecom developments before his
Senate antitrust subcommittee, Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, said this
month: ``We need to take a serious look at the Telecommunications
Act to decide how well it is working, how long we should stay with
it and what might be done to improve it.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision in the 1980s to break up the Ma Bell monopoly left
AT&AMP;T Corp. as the nation's prime long-distance provider while
creating seven regional phone companies to offer local service. But
since passage of the 1996 act, the telecom landscape has undergone
seismic changes.
</P>
<P>
   Southwestern Bell has merged with PacTel into SBC Corp. and Bell
Atlantic has merged with Nynex. SBC is now seeking to merge with
Ameritech while Bell Atlantic wants to hook up with GTE, the
remaining large local phone carrier.
</P>
<P>
   Even as all this takes place, local competitors still serve
barely 1 percent of the Bells' 178 million residential customers.
And phone rates continue to rise in most states, propelled in part
by ``universal service'' fees mandated by Congress and federal
regulators to subsidize underserved customers.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, AT&AMP;T has spent more than $5 billion seeking, mostly in
vain, to enter local phone markets. In June, the company took a new
tack by moving to acquire Tele-Communications Inc. for about $32
billion. By linking to consumers through TCI's cable system, which
reaches 10.5 million homes, AT&AMP;T intends to bypass the Bells'
copper and fiber networks.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of these moves, the Federal Communications
Commission approved WorldCom's purchase of MCI, another major
long-distance provider, thereby removing the last hurdle for
completion of the $40 billion deal.
</P>
<P>
   FCC Chairman William Kennard praises the merger, saying that the
combined company is committed to provide telecom services to
residential areas, ``including our nation's inner cities.''
</P>
<P>
   But Kennard also said that ``our applause for this combination
should be restrained'' because ``once this merger is consummated,
the industry will again be poised just a merger away from undue
concentration. I dare say that any subsequent merger _ of this or
similar magnitude _ between long-distance firms in the near future
should be judged quite differently than the merger before us
today.''
</P>
<P>
   As these mergers occur, the 1996 overall master plan has yet to
jell. Under that plan, long-distance carriers, local phone
companies, cable companies and Internet service providers were
supposed to freely trample through each other's turf.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some pieces are starting to fall into place, despite
legal roadblocks raised by many of the players _ impediments which
have yet to be fully tested in the courts.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Ameritech, the Midwestern Bell giant, is making some headway
in the cable business, while Cox Cable, among others, now provides
local dial tones in such large cities as Phoenix and San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Bell Atlantic appears close to entering the long-distance
market in New York.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  An explosion of telecommunications activity is taking place
via the Internet, where voice and high-speed data exchanges are
increasingly available as stand-alone services.
</P>
<P>
   Many industry figures claim that the open protocols that power
the Internet will soon make distinctions such as ``local'' and
``long distance,'' ``voice'' and ``data,'' ``telephone'' and
``computer'' obsolete.
</P>
<P>
   The need to ``enable the delivery of multiple services by
multiple
</P>
<P>
   suppliers'' is the driving force behind the proposed Bell
Atlantic-GTE link, Ivan Seidenberg, Bell Atlantic's president,
recently told DeWine's antitrust panel.
</P>
<P>
   Describing the deal as ``a pro-competitive response to the
</P>
<P>
   revolutionary changes overtaking the telecommunications
industry,'' Seidenberg noted that annual double-digit growth in
telecommunications equipment and services is expected to continue
through 2001. By then, he predicted, communications will be a $1
trillion industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of this growth is coming from sources we could never have
</P>
<P>
   predicted a few years ago, most notably the explosive demand for
high-speed data services,'' Seidenberg said. Data traffic now
doubles every three months, as opposed to every 12 years for voice
traffic.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some lawmakers remain skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Have patience,' we are told,'' said Sen. Sen. Herb Kohl,
D-Wis. `` 'The act is working, but it will take some time for
competition to take root and grow.' Well, there may be some truth
to this notion, but unless we see more tangible evidence that
consumers have real choices, the pressure will continue to re-open
the act and break the stalemate.''
</P>
<P>
   IN the meantime, Kohl and DeWine plan to ask the General
Accounting Office, the auditing arm of Congress, to investigate
competitive trends in the phone industry.

`SWING' AMERICANS MAY PLAY KEY ROLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Mac Magruder and Rosetta Gainey are on opposite sides of the
country and the national conscience.
</P>
<P>
   Bridgid Smith of Missouri is physically, politically, and
philosophically between them: pulled one way by people like
Magruder who want President Clinton to be impeached, tugged the
other way by those like Gainey who want him left alone.
</P>
<P>
   As Congress considers Kenneth W. Starr's report on Clinton's
sexual escapades and alleged coverup, scores of public opinion
pollsters have questioned people like Magruder, Gainey, and Smith
in search of clues to guide lawmakers through the weeks ahead.
</P>
<P>
   The clear, yet potentially misleading, consensus that emerges
from polls taken since the release of the Starr report is that, for
the moment at least, a majority of Americans want Clinton to remain
in office. Most national polls have found voters roughly 2-to-1
against resignation or impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   But slice through the fog of numbers and a healthy part of that
serve-out-the-term majority is personally repulsed by the
president's behavior; a majority believes he has obstructed justice
and does not share the moral values of most Americans. A majority
also wants Congress to move forward with impeachment hearings, to
investigate Starr's charges.
</P>
<P>
   With those apparent contradictions defining the debate,
pollsters and analysts say Clinton's future may well hinge on
``swing'' or ``pivotal'' Americans like Smith: people who are
disappointed or even disgusted by Clinton personally, but pleased
enough with the job he has done to keep him in office.
</P>
<P>
   By most accounts it is an uncomfortable, unstable middle, made
up of perhaps 30 percent of the voting population. And its members
are acutely aware that by supporting the president's
accomplishments but not the man, they are standing over a growing
chasm of opinion, with one foot on each side.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say the possibility that those voters might
eventually jump one way or the other, depending on how many more
shoes are yet to drop, helps to explain why congressional
Republicans have sought the disclosure of even more potentially
damaging evidence against Clinton _ including today's scheduled
release of his taped grand jury testimony and more explicit details
of sex with Monica Lewinsky. Like adding straw to the back of a
burdened camel, the analysts say, the GOP wants to test the spine
of Clinton's popularity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's those Midwestern Democrats at the lukewarm center,'' said
Del Ali, senior vice president of Mason-Dixon Political/Media
Research in Maryland. ``They don't want him to leave, but they're
on the brink. Any more information and they could turn on him. But
they could turn either way, and that's the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Newport, editor in chief of the Gallup Poll, compared it
to a political campaign that will ultimately be determined by
undecided voters. ``Hard-core voters on the right are unlikely to
change, and the same is true for the hard core on the left. It is
those people in the middle, people who have conflicting opinions of
him at this point, who are more likely to move,'' said Newport.
</P>
<P>
   He said his most recent poll found 63 percent of Americans
approve of Clinton's job performance but only 37 percent have a
favorable opinion of him personally. Newport cautioned, however,
``These numbers might move, and move fast, depending on what comes
next.''
</P>
<P>
   While people at both extremes and in the middle can be found
throughout the country, last week's polls offer insight into what
different types of Americans are thinking, based on region, income,
race, and other features. That makes it possible to identify
individuals who most closely represent the three key streams of
popular thought, using demographic information to find common
characteristics of each, much as police sketch artists use a nose
from here and eyebrows from there to complete a portrait.
</P>
<P>
   On the basis of several prominent national polls _ including The
New York Times/CBS and The Wall Street Journal/NBC News polls,
among others _ it appears that those most intent on seeing Clinton
ousted are wealthy, white, older conservative Republicans who live
in the wide-open spaces of the West. That describes Magruder, 58, a
GOP stalwart who owns a dozen McDonald's franchises in Arizona and
Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   In clear and dramatic contrast, the president's staunchest
supporters are low-income, black, Northeastern, urban, middle-aged
to older liberal Democrats. That describes Gainey, 59, an hourly
wage cashier at a Rite Aid Pharmacy in a tough section of
Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is the conflicted middle, home to the youngest
and oldest voters, mainly from the South and Midwest,
middle-income, independent-minded Democrats or liberal Republicans
who live in the suburbs and midsized cities. That includes Smith,
24, manager of the Boone Tavern in Columbia, Mo., and a graduate
student in education at the nearby University of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm one of those people who think the economy is doing
well, I'm making money and I'm happy,'' said Smith, who said that,
like her upper-income parents, she is ``afraid of the Wall Street
impact'' of impeachment proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel he's done a decent job, and I voted for him twice,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, Smith has a nagging sense of discomfort about Clinton's
behavior, his alleged lies and, in a larger sense, his character.
``In the beginning I didn't care about his personal situation, but
now I feel he's tried to weasel out of it. It's his family that
he's ruined, and he'll always have to live with this. It's all just
so disappointing. Can you just imagine how Chelsea feels?''
</P>
<P>
   Though Smith said she is against resignation or impeachment, she
sent an encouraging signal to Clinton opponents whose strategy is
to pluck the president one feather at a time. ``I don't think it's
impeachable right now. But I could imagine, if it never ends and it
seems to be just one thing after another, being in favor of
impeachment. That is, if he didn't resign first.''

HEY, YOU IN THE GLASS HOUSE! HANDLE THOSE STONES CAREFULLY! 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROBERT JORDAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Kenneth Starr and some Republicans have been busy throwing
rocks at President Clinton, the public has discovered that a few of
those those brick-throwers live in glass houses themselves.
</P>
<P>
   How certain Republicans handle the recent exposures of their own
marital infidelities will determine just how much of a backlash
effect Starr's attempt to humiliate Clinton will have. Based on
early reports, the GOP is not coping very well.
</P>
<P>
   When US Representative Dan Burton, the Indiana Republican who
called Clinton a ``scumbag,'' was found to have fathered a child in
an adulterous affair, he and some of his GOP colleagues placed more
blame on the White House for exposing this than on himself for
having the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, Representative Henry Hyde of Illinois, acknowledged that
he, too, had an adulterous affair in the 1960s. Even though the
woman's husband has acknowledged being the source of this
revelation, Hyde and his colleagues are strongly suggesting that a
leak came from the White House. And that, they say, is worse than
the Lewinsky affair in question.
</P>
<P>
   With these arguments, the conservative GOP wing is, in essence,
arguing that it is more acceptable for Hyde, Burton, or any other
Republican to commit adultery than for President Clinton. That is a
double standard.
</P>
<P>
   The GOP may further argue that at least Hyde and Burton did not
perjure themselves by denying these affairs under oath. As they
make that claim, the independent counsel's office goes about its
apparent mission to destroy the president.
</P>
<P>
   There is now widespread suspicion that the decision to release
the entire Starr report to the media was intended not to inform the
public, but to inflict greater damage on Clinton. While the GOP
attempts to justify the action by saying that the public has ``a
right to know'' all the details, the polls say the public is
shouting back,``But we don't want to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, of course, can blame no one but himself for his
troubles. But the investigation by Starr is aimed not at truth but
at maximizing the public embarrassment heaped upon Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's efforts may backfire by galvanizing the more than 60
percent of the public that approves of the president's job
performance. And those efforts also may create problems with
parents, whose children can access his lurid, detailed report on
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, two key segments of Clinton supporters _ women and
African-Americans _ may be especially offended by the GOP's
excesses. To many, the investigator's tactics are more
objectionable than Clinton's finally-acknowledged relationship with
former White House intern Monica S. Lewinsky. Some have noted that
it is no coincidence that GOP congressmen who are in the forefront
of the investigative effort are the same ones who fight against
affirmative action.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton has more top African-Americans around him than did any
other president,'' said Atlanta-based pollster Harry L. Ross. ``If
we look at the close advisers to Bill Clinton, we see Vernon
Jordan. The person you have to see before you can go into Clinton's
office is Betty Curry. His chief of security among the Secret
Service is Larry Cockell. And during his difficult days, his
spiritual adviser has been the Rev. Jesse Jackson.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with no suggestion of a racial undercurrent to the GOP
campaign, these people help put a face on Clinton's philosophy and
policies, many of which the conservative GOP strongly opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the campaign against Clinton will backfire may be
answered in the November congressional elections. If the Democrats
gain more seats in both the House and Senate, that would be a
message to Republicans that it is time to end its assault on
Clinton _ perhaps with a censure or reprimand.
</P>
<P>
   If the GOP gains seats in both the House and Senate, that would
mean that their strategy is succeeding and impeachment hearings
will proceed.
</P>
<P>
   The key to Clinton's survival rests with the women voters who
have supported his job performance throughout his years in office.
In the coming weeks, those voters may well decide that, although
the are disappointed with Clinton, they've had enough of the GOP's
unrelenting assault on him. If Republicans continue their blind,
bitter assault, they may not see the backlash it has caused _ until
its too late.

DIGGING DEEPER AND DEEPER FOR DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The letter dishing on Henry Hyde came to me from
Florida way back in July.
</P>
<P>
   As is strict policy in the only venue over which I have a
modicum of control _ my own writing _ it was immediately put in the
bottom of a locked drawer that over the years has come to contain
about two inches worth of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Not the dark and grimy kind, but stuff passing on rumors or
making accusations about the private lives of public figures; my
collection is nearly all sex and drugs, with a few phony academic
and military service records, child-support misdeeds, business
career scams, and one side-splittingly detailed ``cheats at golf''
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Florida was unusual in three respects, not
including the abnormally ugly nature of the tale: The writer signed
his name, included a return address, and printed his phone number.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Norman Sommer really lives in Aventura, south of
Hollywood, and really is a retiree pal of the former husband of the
woman Hyde had a five-year affair with in the late 1960s. What's
more, he really was authorized by his embittered pal to try to put
the story out. The method he chose, sending his letter to several
writers, talking by phone with a few others, and nothing more, was
engagingly naive, serving to buttress his bona fides as an
untutored story manager and free agent.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have touched this story with a 10-foot pole,
believing as I do that private behavior is irrelevant to public
character, always has been and always will be. But after checking
Sommer out, I never forgot his letter the way I do most of this
stuff, because it struck me as a slow-burning fuse that was likely
to blow, given the current absence of standards of any meaning in
journalism and given the white-hot atmosphere of the effort to kick
President Clinton out of office. That the Hyde affair began on the
Internet (Salon magazine) and moved instantly into traditional
outlets was utterly unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising, however, was both the intemperate
vituperation of the right's reaction to the unveiling of Hyde's
steamy past and its almost desperate, flailing effort _ without so
much as a shred of evidence _ to accuse senior White House official
Sidney Blumenthal of being the ultimate source or a purveyor of the
story. And even more surprising was the routine willingness of the
press to print smears that had no substance (as in a specific
accusation of a specific act) and no evidence, and are known by
some of us with direct knowledge of the affair to be false.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the likes of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of
Texas, slimy ex-DDT pusher that he is, from floating Blumenthal's
name in almost the same sentence he acknowledged having no evidence
of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to this tortured wreck of a sentence he, Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey came up with in a letter to
FBI director Louis Freeh demanding an investigation of a
nonexistent crime:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether ot not that specific story originated with the White
House or its allies, clearly there is credible evidence that an
organized campaign of slander and intimidation may exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's Illinois toady, a no-account Republican congressman named
Ray LaHood, then said he had fingered Blumenthal by ``process of
elimination.'' For emphasis, he added a comment of mind-blowing
idiocy, ``I think this is Sidney Blumen-thal's MO.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from there being no evidence that Representative LaHood
ever thought anything, the fact is that this is not Blumenthal's
modus operandi. I've dealt with him all year during this mess; he
is tough as nails on the subject of Kenneth Starr, but more
interesting than a blunderbuss like James Carville because he is
substantive. The only negative information I have heard him utter
is public record stuff about past misdeeds and related court
sanctions involving senior members of Starr's prosecution team. It
may be chic around town to Blame Sidney when all else fails. But
the fact remains he plays this game square and to my direct
knowledge has not tossed so much as a molecule of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, this latest outburst of silly irresponsibility on
the right is a clue to the shaky knees of the increasingly partisan
Republican Impeachment Crusade. The Hyde story will not hurt Hyde
among the same general public than puts President Clinton's conduct
in perspective, and it certainly won't hurt among tolerant
Democrats. But it will hurt among the Cotton Mather wannabe
fruitcakes of the Crusade who actually think this kind of junk
matters.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Week Two of a supposedly solemn constitutional
exercise. You ready for another year of it?

CASE COULD HOLD IMPLICATIONS FOR THE WORKPLACE  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADAM PERTMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In mid-August, an adviser to Paula Jones declared that
feminists' reluctance to denounce President Clinton's behavior
toward her was tantamount to permission for men everywhere to
follow Clinton's lead in the workplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the death of sexual harassment,'' the adviser, Susan
Carpenter-McMillan, told television interviewers.
</P>
<P>
   As the country awaits Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony,
it would be difficult to reach that conclusion today. The blaring
headlines about Clinton's liaison and its possible consequences
could not only make would-be sexual harassers think twice, but also
might discourage office romance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a more interesting, subtle issue than people have
focused upon before,'' said Jody Newman, a Boston lawyer who
specializes in sexual harassment lawsuits. ``I think the Clinton
and Lewinsky situation will increase both employees' and employers'
awareness of the complications of a relationship in the workplace
and make them approach it more defensively.''
</P>
<P>
   Some specialists on job-related gender dynamics, as well as
legal analysts, agreed recently on two principal reasons that
special prosecutor Kenneth W. Starr's report on Clinton could alter
workplace behavior.
</P>
<P>
   First, the report focuses such an intense spotlight on the
president's actions that it forces nearly everyone to address the
issues of perceived sexual harassment and office relationships,
particularly those between bosses and their subordinates.
</P>
<P>
   In this regard, the obsession with the Starr report follows the
pattern of the televised hearings on Clarence Thomas's nomination
to become a Supreme Court justice, at which Anita Hill alleged he
had sexually harassed her. Most specialists said those hearings,
which began seven years ago this month, marked a turning point on
sexual harassment by making it a starkly public concern. The
Clinton-Lewinsky drama, at the least, has thrust the issue even
higher on people's agendas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back with Clarence Thomas, we started to see a growth in
awareness and sensitivity,'' said Monica Ballard, head of the
California-based Parallax Education firm, which helps companies
nationwide avoid liability in employment litigation. ``In the same
way, only much bigger, I think ... and hope that this is going to
be catapulting us into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr's report also may influence on-the-job behavior because
Clinton's extramarital affair has had such dire, dramatic, and very
public consequences for him: humiliation, loss of respect, and
possible ouster from a job he cares deeply about. Even if his
affair with an intern does not constitute sexual harassment, and
legal analysts generally say it does not because Lewinsky was a
consenting adult, most people instinctively want to avoid such
repercussions for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   That is why, analysts asserted, executives who might otherwise
embark on sexual relationships with fellow employees may now decide
not to, at least until the publicity dies down. And even people
thinking of dating fellow employees may reconsider for fear that,
like Lewinsky, their partners may ultimately make their lives
difficult, even if the arrangement begins consensually.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would hope that it would only chill the inappropriate
instances ... where there is the confusion of direct lines of
authority, but it could spill over into cases that are
reasonable,'' said Maureen Scully, a specialist in business ethics
and diversity at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Still, she
added, it is ``mostly a good thing'' that the Starr report will
highlight questions of appropriate conduct at work.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those interviewed cautioned that, even if the
president's predicament may yield positive effects, the
often-graphic report is itself causing some gender-related tensions
at businesses. ``Everyone's talking about the graphic details, and
that in itself can create a hostile work environment,'' said
Ballard.
</P>
<P>
   She and others said that some employees, most often male, have
been sending colleagues e-mail containing explicit sexual content
from Starr's report, and many recipients, often female, have not
been pleased to receive the messages. Along the same lines, crude
jokes based on Clinton's reported contacts with Lewinsky have been
making the rounds, sometimes with pointedly sexist punch lines or
intent.
</P>
<P>
   Freada Klein, a Cambridge, Mass. consultant who advises
corporations on how to avoid and deal with sexual harassment, said
she feared that the explicit nature of Starr's report might turn
out to be so distracting that people won't consider the larger
lessons seriously enough. Other analysts also expressed concern
that the president's behavior, even if it is punished, might become
a model for some bosses who decide they can get away with similar
actions because it took a special prosecutor and $40 million to get
evidence against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this explosive chapter in American history does have
some positive results, Klein said she expects that it will not last
long without additional education, counseling, and other programs
to fight sexual harassment. ``Eventually ... people act on their
lust,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Many employers seem sure to read the Clinton-Lewinsky story as a
cautionary tale. As a result, the analysts said, it could promote
efforts to bring more respect to the workplace. ``Even if this
Clinton thing convinces only one or two people who might take
advantage of their position to change their behavior ... then it's
done a service,'' said Charles Rodger, chairman of Work-Family
Directions, a Boston company that helps large firms improve their
on-the-job conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one more time of being whacked over the head with the
reality that behavior like this is dangerous,'' he added. ``And
because it's the president, and there are so many details, it's
going to get people's attention like nothing has before.''

WHY CAN'T A WOMAN WIN MORE LIKE A MAN? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TINA CASSIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the year women stormed political office
in Massachusetts.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, we saw a defeated Lois G. Pines standing on the stage
of a Dorchester union hall hours after the primary polls closed
Tuesday, trying to smile through her contempt and disappointment
after losing the Democratic nomination for attorney general to
Thomas Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are only six states in America in which no women serve
in Congress, in the United States Senate, or in statewide office _
Massachusetts, Mississippi, and four other pretty indistinguished
states,'' Pines said to her deflated devotees.
</P>
<P>
   Ouch.
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie Clapprood, who came in fifth (behind four men) in the
8th Congressional District primary, offered this recollection of
how some voters had responded to her candidacy. ``They said, `We
think you're great but take off those 4-inch shoes before you
speak.' I said, `Did you ask Mike Capuano to take off his
wingtips?'''
</P>
<P>
   Ugh.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, why is this so-called liberal state having such
a hard time electing women, even in a year when eight of them were
running for higher office?
</P>
<P>
   Some of the excuses proffered by those who have tried to figure
it out include: First, politics is a blood sport here, and its
ferocious nature has discouraged many women and taken many out.
Two, local heavily Democratic politics has been influenced by labor
unions, which tend to have ``macho'' traditions not open to female
candidates. Three, the Roman Catholic Church's patriarchal system,
which continues to permeate politics in this corner of the world,
has discouraged women from being important players on the political
stage.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not you buy any of those reasons, there is at least
one more explanation worth considering.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts has a high incumbency rate, making it harder for
women to crack the ranks at many levels. Those in power tend not to
give it up easily. Further, money is often on the side of the
officeholder. Compare that with California, which not only has term
limits but also has a growing population that enlarges its
congressional delegation, both of which provide more opportunities
for women and minorities.
</P>
<P>
   As for those other less-than-distinguished states mentioned by
Pines, less populous states like Massachusetts have always had a
lot in common with Southern states on gender gap issues, according
to Gilda Morales, spokeswoman for the Center for the American Woman
and Politics at Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   She cites low turnover and historical conservatism. US Senator
Strom Thurmond, the 95-year-old Republican who has represented
South Carolina for almost half his life, comes first to mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts at least has sent three women to Congress, and
you've had one lieutenant governor'' in Evelyn Murphy, Morales
said. ``There are seven states that have never sent a woman to
Congress,'' she said, listing Alaska, Delaware, Iowa, Mississippi,
New Hampshire, Vermont and Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Maine and West Virginia are the only two states that have never
elected a woman to high state office, although Maine's two US
senators are women.
</P>
<P>
   But back to Massachusetts _ and this year.
</P>
<P>
   Pines, a state senator from Newton, had experience, money, a
solid campaign organization, a base, and a message, all the things
specialists say a woman needs to compete. She lost by only 6
percentage points to Reilly, the Middlesex district attorney. If
not for her poor showing in their televised debate, perhaps she
might have won.
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Kelly Gay turned out a respectable 46 percent of the
vote against state Senator Warren Tolman of Watertown in the
Democratic race for the lieutenant governor nomination, despite
having no money and a low-visibility post at the Governor's
Council. She earned the support by attending countless coffees.
</P>
<P>
   Had the stars been aligned differently for these women, we could
be declaring 1998 another Year of the Woman. And there still are
redeeming possibilities for the year: Shannon O'Brien is running
for treasurer on the Democratic ticket, and Jane Swift will be Paul
Cellucci's lieutenant governor if the Republicans hold onto the
corner office.
</P>
<P>
   But Clapprood and Susan Tracy were demolished in the 8th
District race, trounced by Capuano, the mayor of Somerville, and
Raymond L. Flynn, former mayor of Boston, both of whom held mayoral
office for more than two terms.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Scott Harshbarger topped Patricia McGovern's
bid for the Democratic nomination for governor, leaving the former
Senate Ways and Means chairwoman _ in the private sector for a few
years now _ a distant second.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation in both those races probably has more to do with
the power of incumbency _ the value of proving oneself in a public
office in the months (or years) leading up to a campaign _ than it
does with any kind of discrimination.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are two kinds of states that don't elect many women: One
are those Southern states like Mississippi and Alabama. And the
other is a group of Northern industrial states, Pennsylvania, New
York, and Massachusetts,'' said Linda L. Fowler, a government
professor at Dartmouth College and director of the Rockefeller
Center for the Social Sciences. ``Incumbency is the single biggest
barrier to women getting into public office ... I think that was
present in this primary.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are other reasons, too.
</P>
<P>
   In that crowded field of 10 Democrats vying to succeed US
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, having a strong base was
crucial. Clapprood drew on the ``women's vote'' in her bid for
Congress (or, as she refers to it, the National Organization for
Men), but women did not provide a strong enough base to elect her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger had a base, and Pat McGovern just didn't,''
said Elizabeth Sherman, director of the Center for Women in
Politics and Public Policy at the University of Massachusetts'
McCormack Institute. ``Not only that, but building a base is
extremely hard to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Clapprood, a former state representative from Sharon, moved to
the district just a few months before Election Day; she had no time
to establish herself there. And Tracy, a former state
representative from Brighton, has a base ``the size of a postage
stamp,'' Sherman said.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy, who, under former Governor Michael S. Dukakis was the
first woman and only woman to hold statewide office in
Massachusetts, said changing politics takes decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year was a measure with all of the women running _ six
women running for statewide office and two in a congressional
race,'' Murphy said. ``But on the other side, the number of men is
huge.''

CLASS ISSUE LOOMS AS FACTOR IN GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A host of issues, from taxes to education, will
dominate the next seven weeks of public debate in the race for
governor, but one factor in the campaign will probably not be
mentioned: the issue of class and culture that is the trademark of
Massachusetts politics.
</P>
<P>
   The 1998 race may well turn on whether Attorney General Scott
Harshbarger can avoid being labeled an elitist and bridge the gulf
between the liberal/reformist wing of the Democratic Party and the
so-called Reagan Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   That explains why the Democratic nominee cannot make a campaign
speech these days without referring repeatedly to the ``working
families'' of Massachusetts and his promises to support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, the insistence on working families didn't resonate
with Harshbarger's profile,'' said Lou DiNatale, a senior fellow at
the University of Massachusetts' McCormack Institute for Public
Affairs. ``But it is becoming clear now that he understands that he
has to make the connection.''
</P>
<P>
   DiNatale said Massachusetts' Democratic leaders have been
struggling for years to keep its base intact despite class
divisions that have torn the party apart.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a real concern within the party that there has been a
disconnect at the root level,'' DiNatale said. ``The leadership is
suburbanized and the vote is urbanized.''
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts say that Harshbarger, a Pennsylvania native
and Harvard graduate who built his career as a reformer, has to
convince urban-based Democrats that he is more than a suburban
elitist and can relate to issues they care about.
</P>
<P>
   That could prove to be difficult running against Acting Governor
Paul Cellucci, whose roots are more connected to Massachusetts.
More important, he has learned his politics in Republican campaigns
that have exploited class and culture. In the 1988 presidential
campaign, Cellucci was part of George Bush's inner circle of
advisers who used the class or so-called wedge issues to alienate
candidate Michael S. Dukakis from his Democratic base.
</P>
<P>
   That theme played out at the Democratic unity breakfast in a
Dorchester union hall Wednesday. While there was talk of rallying
behind the ticket, some party leaders, including Boston Mayor
Thomas M. Menino and House Speaker Thomas M. Finneran, avoided
expressing enthusiasm for Harshbarger's nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Menino, when talking with reporters, could hardly mention
Harshbarger, saying only that he supported the entire Democratic
ticket. But Finneran, a Mattapan legislator and a conservative
Democrat who supported Edward J. King in 1982, took a wait-and-see
attitude, saying he wanted to determine if Harshbarger would be
representing the ``loony left'' wing of the party.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Payne, a Democratic media consultant, said the outcome in
November may hinge on how well Cellucci or Harshbarger defines the
issues of the campaign. And that, he said, will be played out
against the backdrop of old Democratic battles between former
governors Dukakis and King.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are both going to play for the Ed King Democrats, who
wander in and out of the Democratic Party in the gubernatorial
races,'' Payne said.
</P>
<P>
   Payne said Harshbarger is obviously working hard to soften his
reformer/liberal image. For one, he noted, the attorney general has
successfully wooed some factions of organized labor.
</P>
<P>
   But Payne said the best antidote to a Cellucci wedge campaign is
forcing other issues into the debate. ``Ed King used the same
issues as Cellucci has, death and taxes,'' Payne said. ``If you
don't have something in place to counter that, it becomes a
referendum on those issues. You have to establish your own
fronts.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cellucci's rhetoric, while not explicit, does use the
code words that touch on the class issue. Talking with reporters
last week, Cellucci touted his growing up in everyday Hudson and
painted Harshbarger as a liberal elitist.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's certainly to the left. I am much more in the
mainstream,'' Cellucci said.
</P>
<P>
   He also used one of the touchstone phrases that identifies the
liberal elite when he described Harshbarger as hailing from an ``I
know better than you'' wing of the Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger is obviously sensitive to Cellucci's reverting to a
well-tested GOP strategy to alienate Democratic candidates from
their urban base. ``Paul Cellucci would like to run against the
past, set up all the straw men he can,'' he said. ``But he has to
run against my record. This is about the future. He has to figure
what is more popular, pander to the right wing or stand for
something.''

LESSONS CAN BE LEARNED FROM MONICAGATE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Enough wailing over the Clinton mess. We're
stuck with it. As individuals. As a country. The crucial thing now
is, what are we going to do with it?
</P>
<P>
   Use it to learn something? Or continue to point fingers, play
the blame game and separate our chosen villain's actions from those
of the rest of the human race? Worse, must we keep behaving as
though some dark force outside ourselves has made the innocent,
God-fearing people of the United States the victims of a national
disaster?
</P>
<P>
   You can condemn the president, his wife, Monica Lewinsky,
Kenneth Starr or all of them until the end of time. But what has
happened _ every bit of it _ is a fair reflection of our unique and
often contradictory national ethos. We all own it.
</P>
<P>
   There are a slew of truths sticking out of the muck of
Monicagate, some that even the Christian right should love. We can
extract those truths and use them to become better, or at least
more honest people, or we can keep whining about what a shame the
whole thing is.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of whining, if I hear one more parent gripe about how
``unfair'' it is that the Clinton scandal has forced him or her to
talk to a child about ``things like oral sex,'' I may start
breaking windows. Yes, most parents want to control when and how
their children learn the details of that vast and eclectic realm we
call ``sex.'' Life in 1998 rarely cooperates.
</P>
<P>
   And you can't blame only the news media. Sexuality permeates our
culture and shows up in everything from the National Football
League to ``The Little Mermaid.'' Even Pat Robertson rarely misses
an opportunity to show videos of gay and lesbian ``sinners'' on
``The 700 Club.'' Being a '90s parent means always having to answer
questions about sex.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, why don't parents ever gripe about how unfair it is to
have to explain why thousands of human beings sleep on the streets
of the richest nation in the world? Or why one in five American
kids live in poverty? Or why so many daddies beat up so many
mommies yet mommies have so few places to run and hide? Or why
lawmakers still make it easy for the tobacco industry to hook
people on poison?
</P>
<P>
   Why is some aspect of sex always the worst thing we must explain
to a child? Anyway, here's a starter list of lessons from the
Clinton scandal. Feel free to add on.
</P>
<P>
   1. If you're thinking about doing something you know is wrong,
don't ever go ahead just because you figure you won't get caught.
Anybody can get caught. These days, most people get caught. Even
people with executive privilege and Secret Service protection.
</P>
<P>
   2. Oh, what a tangled web we weave when first we practice to
deceive.
</P>
<P>
   3. Girls and young women, if you mess with a married man, you
relinquish all right to truth, justice and dignity _ no matter what
he tells you in the throes of passion. All of us are treated as we
demand to be treated. Behave as though you are just a receptacle
for another person's stress, frustration or bodily fluids, and you
will be treated as such. (Absolute truth: If he talks on the phone
while you perform an intimate physical act upon him, you do not
have his heart.)
</P>
<P>
   4. Despite what fans of the Defense of Marriage Act may tell us,
there is no one-size-fits-all model for a solid, long-lasting
marriage. The glue that keeps people together is often mysterious
and varies as much as bridal dresses do.
</P>
<P>
   5. For all our talk about it and our attempts to legislate it,
sex still confounds many Americans. Every day, recruiting from the
left and right, it makes a whole new army of hypocrites. (Rep.
Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the straight-arrow patriarch of the House
Judiciary Committee, defends the Starr report and says its author
``belongs to the pantheon of saints.'' Then Hyde terms his own
sexual affair with a married woman, conducted when he was in his
mid-40s and also married, a ``friendship'' and a ``youthful
indiscretion.'')
</P>
<P>
   6. Men whose actions demean women in their personal lives can
paradoxically act to increase the power and status of women in
their public lives. (Bill Clinton has appointed more women to
Cabinet and top administrative posts than any other president in
history and has consistently helped protect all women's freedom to
govern their own reproductive systems.)
</P>
<P>
   7. No matter how cool their exterior, zealots sooner or later
lose control and are consumed by the fire of their mission. (See
Starr's $4.4 million, 465-page report and 18 boxes of supporting
evidence based on one sexual affair between one man and one woman.)
</P>
<P>
   8. When the world's most pervasive information-gathering medium
offers 24-hour, unobstructed views into the bedrooms of strangers,
millions of people look and look and look.
</P>
<P>
   9. As Otto von Bismark noted: ``Politics ruins the character.''
</P>
<P>
   10. Flawed people do good works. Good people have flaws. No one
is perfect. Many pretend to be.

MERCIFULLY, THE PUBLIC IS ABOVE IT ALL 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARK SOMMER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Despite the jubilation President Clinton's
hard-core detractors must be feeling following the release of
special prosecutor Kenneth Starr's X-files, the results of the
latest public opinion polls have to be downright maddening.
</P>
<P>
   After eight months of endless media coverage of the sex scandal
_ what New York Times columnist Frank Rich was the first to dub
``All Monica All The Time'' _ the President's job approval ratings
have remained remarkably and consistently high.
</P>
<P>
   The public has been saying clearly, for months, that it draws a
distinction between public policy and personal conduct, and sees
the Clinton affair, as distasteful as it is, to be a private matter
between Bill and Hillary. They concluded long ago that Starr is
anything but an ``independent'' counsel, and they want the sex
scandal to be put in its proper context _ somewhere far down the
list after issues like education, health care and Social Security.
</P>
<P>
   Despite this, the national media have insisted on shoving the
story down the public's throat. In the process, the shortening of
news cycles due to the Internet and around-the-clock TV news
outlets has led to a shameful erosion of journalistic standards.
</P>
<P>
   The president isn't alone in having been harmed by the scandal;
the national media, particularly television, have become so
corrupted in their reach for ratings that they now seem to have
more in common with Jerry Springer than Walter Cronkite.
</P>
<P>
   The initial media frenzy the week the Monica Lewinsky story
broke offered telltale signs of what was to come. ABC's Sam
Donaldson got out of the starting gate to recklessly speculate
about an imminent presidential resignation, possibly coming that
week. CNN and the 24-hour wannabes CNBC, MSNBC and Fox News rushed
to dress up the affair with doomsday titles, catchy graphics and
ominous-sounding countdowns.
</P>
<P>
   As days turned to weeks and then to months, a manufactured
hysteria has continued at a feverish pitch, with the networks and
cable news broadcasts calling on a stable of first-, second- and
even fifth- and sixth-string commentators necessary to feed the
around-the-clock programming. To ensure sparks, the most
opinionated and often extreme partisans, such as Bob Barr, the
obscure Republican congressman from Georgia who seems to have a
pathological hatred for Clinton, have become familiar faces. Many
of these commentators have made a habit of mixing fact and fiction,
or leaving facts out altogether when convenient. Talk radio meets
talk television.
</P>
<P>
   Disturbingly, the national media rejoice in their ``conventional
wisdom'' while remaining oblivious to the free fall of their
journalistic standards.
</P>
<P>
   When habitually unprepared Larry King isn't asking guests about
the scandal, he's pausing to ask them, straight-faced, if the media
are covering the story too much. CNN had the audacity to convene
journalists who have been reporting on the story and call it a
``town meeting.'' ``Meet the Press'' lent respectability to
Internet smut sleuth Matt Drudge by having him on as a guest.
</P>
<P>
   The sorry performance of television is reflected in the title of
Danny Schechter's brilliant new book on TV journalism, ``The More
You Watch, The Less You Know'' (Seven Stories Press).
</P>
<P>
   Schechter, a former producer for CNN and ABC's ``20/20,''
describes how the push for ratings by corporate-owned broadcast
media held in fewer and fewer hands has brought a descent into
info-tainment programming and its fill of gossip, soft news and
celebrities at the expense of stories with substance that are told
with context and nuance. The Clinton sex scandal, like the coverage
of O.J., or the JonBenet Ramsey or Menendez Brothers stories, is
made to order for this kind of tabloid programming.
</P>
<P>
   That's made the public's rebuke of this force-fed story _
reflected in the president's approval ratings _ all the more
astonishing.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls show almost no change in the public approval
ratings for the president that have been issued regularly since
January. An NBC/Wall Street Journal poll put the president's
approval rating at 67 percent last week. That was followed by the
Los Angeles Times, 64 percent; Gallup/CNN, 63 percent; CBS, 61
percent; and ABC and The Washington Post, 59 percent.
</P>
<P>
   So much for the dire predictions that the release of Starr's
report would finally send the president's approval ratings south
the way Watergate did for Richard Nixon or Iran-contra had for
Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, the public is very troubled by Clinton's tryst with
a White House intern and his choice to cover it up by lying. It has
sent his personal approval ratings plummeting. Three recent polls
disclosed that close to 60 percent of the public favors some form
of reprimand. But the same polls show the public overwhelmingly
wants the president to finish his term.
</P>
<P>
   That stands in contrast to the more than 70 newspapers that have
called for the president's resignation.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show around 30 percent of the public wants Clinton
impeached, but that number should be seen in some context,
according to Arkansas pollster and longtime Clinton observer Ernie
Oakleaf of Opinion Research Associates. That percentage of the
public has always shown up in the polls with an intense dislike
toward Clinton, whether in Arkansas or the nation at large.
</P>
<P>
   What's striking is after months of being pummeled by a story
that the national media won't let up on, people are thinking for
themselves. So much for the cynical view that if you tell the
public anything long enough, they'll simply go along for the ride.

LIVE FROM BELOW THE BELTWAY: THE KENNETH STARR SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ I recently wrote that every age gets the scandal
it deserves, and this is the age of Jerry Springer. I got to
thinking about that, and came up with this question: How is the
Jerry Springer show different from the Kenneth Starr show?
</P>
<P>
   1. The fights on the Springer show are fake.
</P>
<P>
   2. Springer features entertaining losers and trailer trash.
</P>
<P>
   3. The obscene language on the Springer show is bleeped.
</P>
<P>
   4. The audience enjoys the Springer show.
</P>
<P>
   5. The Springer show is simply the symbol of the decline of
America, not the downfall itself.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have never seen Springer, but understand
Washington, it works like this:
</P>
<P>
   In front of a howling audience, say Congress, a sleaze in a suit
asks prosecutorial questions of a couple of people with sordid
problems, say, a president and an intern. On the bottom of the TV
screen is a subtitle describing their problems, like ``They had
inappropriate relations.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point in the show, a new element is introduced, whether
it's a wife, a congressman with his own sordid problems, or a
videotape. Hairpulling and chair-throwing ensues.
</P>
<P>
   Two more differences between Starr and Springer:
</P>
<P>
   6. No one really gets hurt on the Springer show.
</P>
<P>
   7. It ends.
</P>
<P>
   This is never going to end. We're all in Clinton-Starr
purgatory. You can't even escape it in an airplane.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday night, Rick Rajecki of Oakland was flying home
from Burbank on Southwest Airlines. The flight attendants passed
out pieces of paper so the passengers could vote on whether
President Clinton should leave office or stay.
</P>
<P>
   One flight attendant, a Clinton fan, offered an extra bag of
peanuts to passengers who would vote in favor of the president. No
one took the bribe. Instead, there was a serious debate among the
passengers, who voted 19 to 17, with two undecided, that Clinton
should stay in office.
</P>
<P>
   The two undecideds must have changed planes at Burbank from a
UFO.
</P>
<P>
   So you think you're tired of Bill, Monica, Ken and all those
philandering members of Congress? You can always turn off the
scandal and watch Springer.
</P>
<P>
   Those of us who work at newspapers are forced to follow the
Beltway bad sex show. We have one TV tuned to Springer for relief,
but the sound is turned down and we guess the topic from across the
room by the bad hairdos and piercings.
</P>
<P>
   You don't have to guess the topic on CNN. How long can you watch
Greta Van Susteren before she becomes Van Insufferable?
</P>
<P>
   The high road has been washed out by the unending sleaze storm.
We're no longer making jokes. The incoming faxes and Internet
postings are worse than ever. The only printable one I received
last week was from a support group for women named Monica.
</P>
<P>
   How about a support group for those of us called Americans?
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of it all, a fresh bucket of cold slime was thrown
in Republicans' faces by San Francisco's own high-toned Webzine,
Salon.
</P>
<P>
   You have to give them credit for pinning a big scarlet A and H
for ``Adultery'' and ``Hypocrisy'' on House Judiciary Committee
Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill. The A and H can be pronounced ``Ah'' or
``Ha.''
</P>
<P>
   An editorial in Salon said they wouldn't have released the
details of Hyde's affair of 30 years ago if this were ``a different
and better world.''
</P>
<P>
   Boy, is it not, and never will be.
</P>
<P>
   Hyde referred to his affair as ``youthful indiscretions'' even
though he was in his jowly 40s and the thing went on for years.
Maybe he was referring to his beautician lover, who seemed youthful
in the photo in Salon. Finally, a beautician in Salon.
</P>
<P>
   The latest thing is adding up newspapers calling for Clinton's
resignations. The latest total is that far too many newspapers have
called for Clinton's resignation. Why bother? The old goat will
never resign.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to pick up women when you're on workfare.
</P>
<P>
   Last week I hit the wall. I took two days off from this column
to research and write an upbeat story that has absolutely nothing
to do with politics. A little notice said ``Rob Morse is on
assignment,'' although I wanted it to say, ``Rob Morse is sick of
the whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   That upbeat story hasn't run yet, because it comes with
photographs, and there's no room in the newspaper because of the
constantly breaking smut from Washington. There may never be room
in the paper, if politicians' sexual affairs keep being revealed.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans think they will gain from this scandal,
particularly if they keep Clinton under a steady water-torture of
leaks. Sorry, the only ones to gain from this will be glass
companies, who'll be rebuilding all the shattered glass houses.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, scandal fans. If you loved Jerry Springer's ``Too Hot for
TV'' video, there's now Bill Clinton's ``Too Hot to Talk to Ken''
video, with dirty words you've never heard on TV before.
</P>
<P>
   You read the book, now watch the video. Try not to throw any
chairs.

SAILOR'S LETTER AMONG `TRASH' CLEANED UP FROM BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A letter in an airtight container from a
Ukranian sailor seeking an American pen pal took first prize as the
most unusual thing found in the San Francisco Bay area's coastal
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   A troop of Eagle Scouts helping clean up Angel Island won $500
for finding the handwritten letter and photo, apparently tossed
from a ship docked in the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Kudienko Vladislav apologized in the letter for his poor English
and for causing pollution, but said he didn't want to die without
trying to make an acquaintance with someone with whom he might have
some common interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so cool,'' said Judi Shils of the California Coastal
Commission. ``I just thought it would be amazing if people saw this
and everybody wrote to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scout troop was part of a statewide turnout of more than
40,000 volunteers who scoured the coastline, lakefronts and
riverbanks Saturday under brilliant skies. They picked up at least
400,000 pounds of trash and recyclables.
</P>
<P>
   That's less than was picked up last year. Shils said people are
beginning to think twice before tossing discards in storm drains
and leaving garbage behind on beaches. The annual California
Coastal Cleanup Day, now in its 14th year, is also leaving the
waterways less cluttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is getting out,'' Shils said.

PROTESTERS BARE ALL AGAINST ANTI-NUDITY LAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ERIC BRAZIL  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Nudists thumbed their noses and exposed all
other body parts at Berkeley's anti-nudity ordinance Sunday in
their seventh annual romp in the raw.
</P>
<P>
   Encouraged by gawkers, warmed by the sun and unhassled by the
police, the small group paraded their bare breasts and bottoms for
2 1/2 hours to the accompaniment of drums, bells and a guitar.
</P>
<P>
   By actual count, there was one naked woman, X-Plicit Players
troupe leader Deborah Moore, two bare-breasted women and a dozen
naked men _ most of them wearing shoes and hats, some with gaudy
adornments and one with a tattoo of flames around his bottom.
</P>
<P>
   They hoisted placards reading ``Our Bodies Are Freedom of
Speech,'' ``Human Nature'' and ``Exalt the Body,'' and they drew a
crowd of about 200 to People's Park and several dozen to street
corners where they stopped to pose and rap.
</P>
<P>
   Some spectators who inadvertently caught the show were offended.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was this naked guy up in a tree, and I asked, `What are
you doing up in the tree?' and he said, `It feels right,''' said
John Hunter of Oakland, shaking his head. ``It's cool to be nude,
but they're not doing it the right way. Besides, they're real
ugly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become another form of art. We've become sacred
sculpture,'' intoned Moore as she prepared to lead the group from
People's Park to Telegraph Avenue. ``We appreciate the love that
you give.''
</P>
<P>
   The group mantra that evolved during what its organizers call
the Nude and Breast Freedom Parade was ``where else but in Berkeley
can we be free?''
</P>
<P>
   Berkeley hasn't had a lot of success in enforcing an anti-nudity
ordinance enacted in 1993, inspired by a pro-skin activist who
became famous as ``The Naked Guy.'' The ordinance made public
nudity a misdemeanor. The Berkeley City Council amended the
ordinance in July to allow prosecutors to charge violators with
either an infraction or a misdemeanor.
</P>
<P>
   Charging naked people with infractions is a means of bypassing
trial by jury and leaving findings and fines of up to $400 to a
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Moore and co-performer Marty Kent sued the city last week,
asserting that the ordinance is a denial of their civil rights.

NEW TECHNIQUE COULD REDUCE MULTIPLE BIRTHS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (With sidebar, SCI-INVITRO-SUCCESS)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON - &UR;  &LR; Though they have given hope _ and babies _ to
thousands of infertile couples, in vitro fertilization clinics have
also been creating many multiple-birth pregnancies that sometimes
end in miscarriages, deaths, or costly medical complications.
</P>
<P>
   But a new embryo transfer technique developed in the past year
may finally allow the IVF enterprise to dramatically reduce the
multiple-birth problem while maintaining, or even improving, the
often frustratingly low rate of successful pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure to curb the births of triplets and higher multiples is
being intensified by managed-care insurers, who are beginning to
demand that IVF providers meet performance benchmarks, a process
that may lead to something of a shakeout in Massachusetts and
elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   At one IVF program in Boston, an infertility scientist who has
triplets of her own is almost ecstatic about the newest technique
for reliably getting women pregnant with just one or two embryos.
The breakthrough, called ``blastocyst transfer,'' enables newly
fertilized eggs to be grown in laboratory dishes for five days
instead of three, so they're more mature and likely to ``take''
when implanted into the patient's uterus.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's funny being in the position I am now,'' says Katherine
Rakowsky, director of the IVF lab at Brigham and Women's Hospital,
where about 70 blastocyst transfers have been performed. While
Rakowsky welcomed the birth of her own triplets (now healthy and
happy at age 11) after years of infertility, she says, ``I've seen
the other side of it: A lot of these multiple pregnancies do fail,
and it's not a pretty sight.''
</P>
<P>
   While the successful birth of septuplets last year in Iowa may
have fostered a belief that medicine can create a happy ending to
all multiple births, that's far from the case.
</P>
<P>
   Even twins have a higher rate of prematurity and complications,
resulting in average birth costs of about $40,000 compared to
$10,000 for single births, says Dr. Fredric Frigoletto, an
obstetrician at Massachusetts General Hospital. Triplets send the
costs spiralling to about $100,000.
</P>
<P>
   These expenses reflect additional hospitalization, intensive
care, and other interventions, he says. The risk of fetal death is
12 times higher in triplet births than in singletons, and there are
more complications, such as brain damage, respiratory distress, and
developmental problems.
</P>
<P>
   Edward and Jeannine Shea of Braintree, Mass. have 2-year-old
triplets who were born eight weeks premature following IVF. The
doctors implanted all three of the embryos that resulted from in
vitro fertilization in Jeannine's womb: All of them ``took.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't thrilled because I knew there was a big risk until
they got here, and then a lot of work after they arrived,'' says
Edward Shea. The triplets spent 3 1/2 weeks in the hospital, and
one had respiratory problems requiring a breathing machine. ``He is
still developmentally a little slower,'' says the father.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 Massachusetts programs provide in vitro fertilization,
which is about 20 years old in the United States, along with other
infertility treatments. IVF involves harvesting a number of eggs
from a woman's ovaries after they have been stimulated with drugs,
and fertilizing them outside the body with sperm from her partner
or a donor. Sometimes donor eggs are used if the woman is incapable
of producing her own.
</P>
<P>
   The embryos are allowed to develop for two or three days in a
laboratory dish, and then the healthiest-appearing are selected to
be implanted into the woman's uterus. Because not all embryos will
implant in the uterine lining and develop normally, IVF
practitioners have traditionally transferred more than one _ often
several _ in hopes that at least one will implant.
</P>
<P>
   Here's the rub: The results can't be predicted, and in many IVF
clinics 20 or 30 percent or even more pregnancies result in twins,
and about 3 percent or so are triplets or greater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I consider that not a success, but a failure,'' says Dr. Vito
Cardone, director of the Fertility Center of New England.
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to reduce these rates by transferring fewer embryos can
lead to a lower pregnancy rate, making patients and clinic
directors alike unhappy. Conversely, struggling clinics sometimes
boost the number of embryos transferred, achieving higher pregnancy
rates but also producing more twins, triplets, or even quadruplets.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the National Center for Health Statistics reported a
``remarkable'' increase in triplet and higher-multiple births over
the last two decades, from 1,034 births in 1971 to 4,973 in 1995.
About a third of the increase is due solely to women having babies
at a later age when multiple births are more likely; the remainder
are believed to be due to fertility treatments, including IVF.
Massachusetts, the report noted, had the highest triplet birth
ratio in the country from 1992 to 1994, more than twice as high as
the national average.
</P>
<P>
   Women who develop multiple pregnancies can opt for ``selective
reduction'' _ terminating one or more fetuses _ to improve the odds
that some will survive and be healthy. But such selective abortion
is a tough decision, and many women can't accept it.
</P>
<P>
   IVF specialists are now hoping for a sharp drop in unwanted
multiple pregnancies as clinics here and elsewhere begin to adopt
the blastocyst transfer technique.
</P>
<P>
   Until recently, scientists were unable to sustain many embryos
in the laboratory to the 5-day-old blastocyst stage, but a new
culture medium developed by Dr. David Gardner, a Colorado
scientist, has sharply improved success rates. At Brigham and
Women's, about 30 percent of embryos are now grown to the
blastocyst stage, says Dr. Elizabeth Ginsburg, head of the IVF
clinic.
</P>
<P>
   And, she added, about 60 percent of patients whose embryos
become blastocysts are achieving pregnancy _ a substantially higher
rate than with 3-day-old embryos, she says.
</P>
<P>
   No births have occurred yet, but as of last week there were 28
ongoing pregnancies among 53 women who had blastocysts implanted,
she said. Since only two embryos are transferred into each woman,
there are no triplet pregnancies, though so far eight of the
pregnancies have been determined to be twins.
</P>
<P>
   One of those is Melissa Pelletier of Hingham, who, at 27, had
been trying to get pregnant for a year-and-a-half and didn't want
to risk having triplets. In March she had 25 eggs extracted from
her ovaries that, when fertilized with her husband's sperm, yielded
11 embryos. Three of those, the most viable, made it to the
blastocyst stage.
</P>
<P>
   ``They implanted two, and two took,'' says Pelletier, who says
she is thrilled with the results.
</P>
<P>
   Because IVF specialists had not been able to accurately predict
how many 3-day-old embryos would result in pregnancies, IVF success
rates and multiple-pregnancy rates have been hard to control. But
in the laboratory, only the strongest embryos appear to make it to
the more mature blastocyst stage, when the embryo has a distinct
layer of cells that help it implant into the uterine lining, says
Rakowsky.

KEEPING YOUR HEAD ABOVE THE WATERLILIES

   Emerging from the Museum of Fine Arts' marvelous Monet exhibit
you're funneled willy-nilly into the Monet shop, where
Impressionism meets capitalism, and you are overwhelmed and
underwhelmed by a multitude of Monet items, among them:
</P>
<P>
   _the Monet waterlilies wristwatch, $39.95.
</P>
<P>
   _the waterlilies Christmas ball, $36.
</P>
<P>
   _Le Petit Flowers of Monet Flower and Seed Mixture, $16.95.
</P>
<P>
   _waterlilies French provincial soap, small $12.95, large $28.50.
</P>
<P>
   There's tons more phonet Monet in the main museum shop, too. The
waterlilies apron, ``with a handy pocket,'' $28. Waterlilies
placemats, set of four, $39.50. Waterlilies pillows, large $79.50,
small $50.95. Waterlilies hostess serving trays (``... the
delightful motif is sure to spark conversation! Made of smooth,
durable melamine''), $26 and $29.95. The waterlilies pencil caddy,
$18.50. And one of my favorites, Monet bottle stoppers (``Top your
favorite bottle of wine or olive oil with the work of an
Impressionist master!'') set of two, $32.
</P>
<P>
   There's Monet memorabilia for the kiddies, too, including
``Phillipe in Monet's Garden,'' $10.95, the illustrated tale of a
frog that finds a home among those famous waterlilies. The
companion stuffed Phillipe will set you back an additional $10.95.
He's very appealing, though, and a bargain, too, which is more than
can be said for some of the other Monet-related stuff.
</P>
<P>
   The people who run the Boston museum's retail arm, MFA
Enterprises, haven't thought of everything _ I confess I was
disappointed not to find a Monet oven mitt _ but they have
succeeded in placing Monet on an amazing array of merchandise.
``Monet is so popular as an artist,'' said Elise Germano, public
relations coordinator for MFA Enterprises. ``People just love his
images and want to have something to remember him by that is
beautiful and functional.''
</P>
<P>
   It's an understandable impulse. Alas, some museum-goers are
happy to settle for things that are merely functional. Although who
am I to say that the waterlilies accordian file isn't beautiful? I
will say, though, that at $35 it seems a little overpriced. But one
woman's trash is another's treasure. Wandering alone Friday morning
in the museum shop, I came upon a display of waterlilies playing
cards ($14.95 for two decks and a score pad). ``Oh, God,'' I said
out loud, ``a Monet bridge set.''
</P>
<P>
   A woman nearby said, ``Yes, they make lovely gifts.''
</P>
<P>
   Museums increasingly depend upon retail sales for revenue, which
inevitably leads to items like Monet bridge sets. With its popular
catalog and five satellite stores in local malls, the MFA has one
of the biggest museum retail operations in the nation. According to
Germano, sales of museum merchandise were off last year. ``We
didn't have the response to our catalog we'd hoped,'' she said.
``Some years it's really great and some years it's awful.''
</P>
<P>
   This year is bound to be one of those really great years, with
the Monet exhibit packing 'em in through the end of December.
Friday morning, traffic was heavy in the museum shop, and the show
had yet to open to the general public. ``How's business?'' I asked
the woman who rang up my waterlilies salt and pepper shakers, $24,
a must in any civilized home. ``It's been wild,'' she said. ``And
it's going to get wilder.''
</P>
<P>
   At the T-shirt display two women were debating a purchase. The
T-shirts, $15.95, are tasteful, as T-shirts go, and, perversely,
made me wish I could buy a really tacky one emblazoned, ``My
Friends Went to the Monet Exhibit and All I Got Was This Lousy
T-Shirt.'' Compared with a Monet bottle stopper, that doesn't seem
all that tacky.

WHAT MAKES THE WIND BLOW? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID ROPEIK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. How is wind formed?
</P>
<P>
   A.Z., Lexington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Bob Dylan said ``You don't need a weatherman to know which
way the wind blows.'' But a forecaster is handy if you want to know
why it blows.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologist Chris Bedford of Weather Services, Inc. says you
can thank the sun for the winds that blow, from the gentlest zephyr
to the fiercest hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   As the sun heats the atmosphere, some air gets warmer than other
air. In warm air, the sun's heat speeds up the random motion of
molecules of oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide and water vapor, and
they spread apart. In colder air, the ``calmer'' molecules stay
more tightly-packed together.
</P>
<P>
   Now imagine two boxes of the same size, one around a section of
warm air, one around colder air. The box of warm air contains fewer
molecules. That air literally weighs less, so the pressure it
exerts on anything around it is lower. The box of cold air has more
molecules, weighs more, and exerts higher pressure. That's what
weather people mean when they talk about low pressure and high
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Where air at higher pressure meets air at lower pressure, (what
meteorologists call a weather front) the high pressure air
molecules move toward the area where the pressure is lower and the
resistance is less. That movement of molecules is wind.
</P>
<P>
   The greater the difference in pressure, the faster the high
pressure air moves toward the lower pressure, and the faster the
wind blows.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. How do tornadoes start?
</P>
<P>
   P.C., Dorchester, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Take one unit of cold, dry air at high pressure and high
altitude and mix it with an equal dose of warm, moist air with
significantly lower pressure closer to the ground. Get the warm air
moving up into the cold, dry air, and you've got the basic
ingredients for a thunderstorm, and possibly a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologist Howard Bluestein of Oklahoma University, a noted
authority on tornadoes, says the chances for a twister increase if
the thunderstorm then develops into a supercell, a storm that
contains something called a mesocyclone.
</P>
<P>
   That can develop when the winds outside the storm vary in speed
and direction as they vary their height, what's called wind shear.
The wind speeds can be as much as four times faster at 20,000 feet
than they are closer to the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Even though those twisting winds are outside the thunderstorm,
they sometimes start a column of air inside the storm spinning like
the axle of a car, horizontally, above the ground. That's the
beginning of the mesocyclone, which can grow to three miles long
and five miles high.
</P>
<P>
   Now, remember that warm moist air rising into the storm? The
faster it rises, and the greater the wind shear, the faster the
mesocyclone will spin.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes the rising warm air grabs that spinning column and
bends it around from horizontal to a more vertical direction. To
understand how this works, spin a pencil in your hands, level with
the ground. Now imagine warm air hitting the eraser, and pushing it
upward, dropping the point downward. Keep spinning the pencil. When
that vertical column of spinning air descends to the ground, you
have a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Thunderstorms that don't develop mesocyclones also can spawn
tornadoes, however, when very strong updrafts of warm air inside
the storm clash with falling columns of colder air and set things
spinning. These tornados tend to be weaker. Scientists aren't sure
exactly how they develop. Nor do they know why some thunderstorms
develop into supercells and some don't, or why some supercell
thunderstorms spawn tornadoes, and some don't.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has more tornadoes than any other nation _ 75
percent of the Earth's total, in fact _ because of the unique way
the Rocky Mountains and Great Plains bring warm moist air from the
Gulf of Mexico into a region of strong wind shear. The National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration says this country averages
about 800 tornadoes a year, and about 100 tornado-related deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Bluestein says the fastest tornadic wind ever measured &UR;  &LR;  was
about 280 miles an hour. Incidentally, the Fujita Scale used to
measure the strength of tornadoes rates them not by wind speed but
by the severity of the damage they do. The weakest, F-0s and F-1s,
will rip off loose shingles and take down some branches and small
trees. F-5s destroy large well-built buildings.

DIGGING DEEPER AND DEEPER FOR DIRT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The letter dishing on Henry Hyde came to me from
Florida way back in July.
</P>
<P>
   As is strict policy in the only venue over which I have a
modicum of control _ my own writing _ it was immediately put in the
bottom of a locked drawer that over the years has come to contain
about two inches worth of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Not the dark and grimy kind, but stuff passing on rumors or
making accusations about the private lives of public figures; my
collection is nearly all sex and drugs, with a few phony academic
and military service records, child-support misdeeds, business
career scams, and one side-splittingly detailed ``cheats at golf''
allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The letter from Florida was unusual in three respects, not
including the abnormally ugly nature of the tale: The writer signed
his name, included a return address, and printed his phone number.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Norman Sommer really lives in Aventura, south of
Hollywood, and really is a retiree pal of the former husband of the
woman Hyde had a five-year affair with in the late 1960s. What's
more, he really was authorized by his embittered pal to try to put
the story out. The method he chose, sending his letter to several
writers, talking by phone with a few others, and nothing more, was
engagingly naive, serving to buttress his bona fides as an
untutored story manager and free agent.
</P>
<P>
   I wouldn't have touched this story with a 10-foot pole,
believing as I do that private behavior is irrelevant to public
character, always has been and always will be. But after checking
Sommer out, I never forgot his letter the way I do most of this
stuff, because it struck me as a slow-burning fuse that was likely
to blow, given the current absence of standards of any meaning in
journalism and given the white-hot atmosphere of the effort to kick
President Clinton out of office. That the Hyde affair began on the
Internet (Salon magazine) and moved instantly into traditional
outlets was utterly unsurprising.
</P>
<P>
   What was surprising, however, was both the intemperate
vituperation of the right's reaction to the unveiling of Hyde's
steamy past and its almost desperate, flailing effort _ without so
much as a shred of evidence _ to accuse senior White House official
Sidney Blumenthal of being the ultimate source or a purveyor of the
story. And even more surprising was the routine willingness of the
press to print smears that had no substance (as in a specific
accusation of a specific act) and no evidence, and are known by
some of us with direct knowledge of the affair to be false.
</P>
<P>
   That didn't stop the likes of House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of
Texas, slimy ex-DDT pusher that he is, from floating Blumenthal's
name in almost the same sentence he acknowledged having no evidence
of any kind.
</P>
<P>
   But listen to this tortured wreck of a sentence he, Speaker Newt
Gingrich and Majority Leader Dick Armey came up with in a letter to
FBI director Louis Freeh demanding an investigation of a
nonexistent crime:
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether ot not that specific story originated with the White
House or its allies, clearly there is credible evidence that an
organized campaign of slander and intimidation may exist.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyde's Illinois toady, a no-account Republican congressman named
Ray LaHood, then said he had fingered Blumenthal by ``process of
elimination.'' For emphasis, he added a comment of mind-blowing
idiocy, ``I think this is Sidney Blumen-thal's MO.''
</P>
<P>
   Aside from there being no evidence that Representative LaHood
ever thought anything, the fact is that this is not Blumenthal's
modus operandi. I've dealt with him all year during this mess; he
is tough as nails on the subject of Kenneth Starr, but more
interesting than a blunderbuss like James Carville because he is
substantive. The only negative information I have heard him utter
is public record stuff about past misdeeds and related court
sanctions involving senior members of Starr's prosecution team. It
may be chic around town to Blame Sidney when all else fails. But
the fact remains he plays this game square and to my direct
knowledge has not tossed so much as a molecule of dirt.
</P>
<P>
   More likely, this latest outburst of silly irresponsibility on
the right is a clue to the shaky knees of the increasingly partisan
Republican Impeachment Crusade. The Hyde story will not hurt Hyde
among the same general public than puts President Clinton's conduct
in perspective, and it certainly won't hurt among tolerant
Democrats. But it will hurt among the Cotton Mather wannabe
fruitcakes of the Crusade who actually think this kind of junk
matters.
</P>
<P>
   So much for Week Two of a supposedly solemn constitutional
exercise. You ready for another year of it?

WILL AND GRACE 
Starring: Debra Messing, Eric McCormack, Sean Hayes, Megan
Mullally 
On: NBC 
Time: Monday at 9:30 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There's no shortage of hand-on-hip flirtation and morning-after
sexuality between all those chiseled men and aerobicized women in
sitcomland, that's for sure. But while former lovers tediously
torment themselves on ``Friends'' and future lovers do their
endless little dance on ``Caroline in the City,'' along comes a
smart new comedy that pays homage to pure friendship between the
sexes. Called ``Will &AMP; Grace,'' it's a TV-sized version of ``The
Object of My Affection'' and ``My Best Friend's Wedding,'' in which
the heroine's most uncomplicated and enduring love is for the gay
man who is her best friend. It's the latest entry in NBC's
strangely long line of series about unmarried people.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the post-``Ellen'' prime-time world, where a sitcom
featuring an openly gay central character doesn't need to be hugely
controversial. Nor does it seem necessary for this lead gay
character to fixate on his sexual orientation or spend every week
educating America about its hardships (sorry, Ellen). The first two
episodes of ``Will &AMP; Grace'' are character-based and wonderfully
lesson-free, with Will's gayness treated as a comfortable given, as
one facet of his personality. There are a smattering of gay jokes
and a queeny, more stereotypically gay supporting character, but
it's all part of the show's larger portrait of friendship and
intimacy in New York City. After presenting Will as a gay man, will
the show go on to neuter him? Will he be allowed to have as much of
a dating life as Grace? Let's wait and see.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is pretty simple: Can the ideal friendship between Will
and Grace survive the mundanities of living together? The initial
episodes set up the situation. Will is an easygoing lawyer whose
boyfriend recently moved out, and Grace is an insecure interior
designer in the process of leaving her boyfriend, a guy who
high-fives her after sex. By the end of next week's show, the two
are roommates, challenging the notion that good fences make good
neighbors. As Will and Grace, Eric McCormack and Debra Messing are
appealing, if not especially dynamic. They have a pleasing
chemistry: She relies on his advice (even for decorating, despite
the fact that she's a decorator), and he enjoys being relied upon
by her.
</P>
<P>
   The fireworks belong to the two strong supporting players. Sean
P. Hayes, recently appearing in movie theaters in ``Billy's
Hollywood Screen Kiss,'' is Will's show-tune-singing pal. He
arrives to stay with Will for a few weeks, carrying a hatbox and a
birdcage, and he can't understand why everyone assumes he likes
men. He tosses tart lines like ``Welcome to Cynical Island.
Population: You'' in Will's direction, and he appears to have a
charged relationship with his mother. He's a gay cliche, except
that Hayes invests Jack with a distinctively runtlike twist. Megan
Mullally plays Grace's assistant, Karen, an aristocratic woman who
wears mink in the office and doesn't quite understand the whole
work thing. Next week's episode includes an absolutely delightful
scene in which Jack and Karen meet and engage in the most curious
and original flirtation I've ever seen. Like any two unique
characters, they ... rub stomachs. You have to see it.
</P>
<P>
   If you're looking for sexual tension amid the laugh track, or
social and political point-making between the punchlines, then
``Will &AMP; Grace'' may not work for you. It's a sitcom that has the
potential to prove to prime time that attractions between adults
are not always rooted in lust. With its promising little ensemble,
the biggest problem is that it's scheduled opposite ``Ally
McBeal.''

THE HUMBLING HUMANITY, RESILIENCE OF A FARMING FAMILY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Young Nebraska farmers Juanita and Darrel Buschkoetter, the
hard-toiling parents of three girls, are more than mere survivors.
They are heroes: people-sized, credible American originals. Despite
their frailties, they are unbreakable _ but not unbendable. With
heart and ingenuity, they manage to flex when the fierce pressures
of family farming threaten to bankrupt their business and mow down
their marriage. Somehow, they never finally surrender their love,
their unflinching decency, or their dream, all the more poignant
for its modesty, to endure as small grain and cattle farmers in the
middle of America.
</P>
<P>
   When the characters in a movie or book or play lodge in your
mind and heart, stubbornly taking up residence without necessarily
being invited, you know the artist responsible for them has done
something very right.
</P>
<P>
   Such is the case with ``The Farmer's Wife,'' David Sutherland's
nonfiction film covering three years in the struggling lives of the
Buschkoetters. Shaping their daily routine into a memorable
narrative is an imaginative feat achieved by Sutherland in this
artfully textured, heart-wrenching film.
</P>
<P>
   Presented by the PBS public affairs series Frontline, the
three-part, six-and-a-half-hour documentary airs Monday-Wednesday
at 9 p.m. This is a big investment of time for any viewer, and some
of the film moves with the kind of deliberate, almost ritual,
slowness of the grinding farm work that can occupy Darrel 15 hours
a day. But this deeply American tale of loss and renewal will repay
your attention in countless ways. To see only sections of it would
diminish the accumulating emotional impact of Part 3. In it, as the
Buschkoetter farm seems miraculously about to flourish, their
marriage teeters on the verge of collapse.
</P>
<P>
   That all of this matters so much is a tribute to the vision and
tenacity of Sutherland who, of course, didn't know how his episodic
story would turn out when he began filming in 1994. But he clearly
appreciated the humanity and remarkable resourcefulness of the
extraordinary ``ordinary'' people who are his subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Though articulate, especially describing his love for Juanita _
``my everything,'' he calls her _ Darrel is notable for his
singular sense of purpose. Losing his vocation would, he says, be
like ``cutting off my leg.'' Almost every calorie he burns is
calculated to grow things and bind his family to the land. His
arsenal of skills is a measure of the harsh requirements of
independent farmers (and surely among the reasons so few can
survive today). Darrel is an able car and farm-machinery mechanic
who can operate huge combines and harvesters; something of a
self-taught veterinarian and naturalist; a fence-mending cowboy;
businessman; and dexterous handyman.
</P>
<P>
   Juanita, whose sharp-cut prettiness makes her resemble a Walker
Evans portrait of the Depression, is sweet and tough, gifted with
agile intelligence and keen insight. It's not too much to say she
saves the day: securing loans that prop up the farm, lovingly
minding her daughters, stretching the family's faltering income,
and even in the middle of marital anguish, candidly articulating
and coping with her own shortcomings as well as Darrel's.
</P>
<P>
   The arc of the long film is simple: A farm is besieged by debt
and bad weather and falling commodity prices; a relationship is
assailed by money woes, intergenerational tension, and a painful
shift in the balance of power between husband and wife. Much of it
unfolds on the Buschkoetters' flat, often muddy, leased land, in or
nearby their little yellow house where the daughters share a room
and a big bed.
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland employs the peeling house as chief location and
resonant leitmotif. Its deteriorating image, captured in every
season, often under severely beautiful skies, serves as a richly
poetic icon, distilling themes of isolation and despair,
domesticity and solidarity.
</P>
<P>
   This is a document about love, and also about sheer toil _
including Darrel's body-busting extra job as a factory laborer and
Juanita's work as a maid cleaning the toilets of more prosperous
farmers. There is little repose or escape: a rare family birthday
celebration, a festive Halloween party for the girls Juanita funds
with five scraped-together dollars. Release is found mostly in
sleep or in the joys of more thankful labor. In the planting
season, Darrel considers his nearly sleepless nights churning up
his fields aboard a huge, clattering planter better than going to a
party.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder, then, the almost mystical stillness you sense when
Darrel and Juanita face the camera during the few semiformal
interviews that interlard the spontaneous, cinema verite footage of
``The Farmer's Wife.'' Even as they argue, they are immobile: Spent
from work, they seem to economize their physical gestures,
conserving energy to invest in their cherished farm.
</P>
<P>
   It would be dishonest to say there aren't moments of tedium in
``The Farmer's Wife.'' On the other hand, it is precisely
Sutherland's patient, unsentimental attention to telling detail
that can alchemize the most ordinary-seeming moment into emotional
gold. In one scene that can only really be appreciated on screen,
Darrel, his back to the camera, lugs a heavy tire from one place to
another. Slightly angled under its weight, he is a humbling picture
of Sisyphean perseverance.
</P>
<P>
   Humbling, in fact, is an apt word for the Buschkoetters, and the
ingenuity, resilience, and sacrifice they bring to their love and
work. Their unshakable humanity is humbling, and so, too, is
filmmaker Sutherland's homage to it.

PRESCRIPTION FOR WAR: TOO MANY YOUNG MEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ART ADV.: A map is being sent to NYTNS clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchases by calling 212-556-4204 or -1927.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   What triggers most wars is not ideology or honor, says a new
theory based on evolutionary biology, but a society bottom-heavy
with young, unmarried and violence-prone males. When their numbers
become too great, this explanation holds, they form ``coalitions''
bent on seizing territory, goods or other resources they need to
marry and have offspring.
</P>
<P>
   The idea is being put foward by researchers probing the
biological roots of war, who say their analysis of population
patterns shows that this evolutionary perspective explains
conflicts from ancient times to today's hot spots.
</P>
<P>
   Stripped of its political trappings and illusions and cast in
terms more typical of descriptions of animal behavior, what the
theory says is that war is ``a form of intrasexual male competition
among groups, occasionally to obtain mates but more often to
acquire the resources necessary to attract and retain
mates,'' &UR;  &LR; according to two Canadian psychologists who advanced this
theory at a meeting in Boston recently.
</P>
<P>
   The new view challenges the classic belief that old men start
wars and send young men to die in battle. In fact, the authors
write, ``those leaders are probably as much a creation of the
coalition (of young, aggressive men) as they are the instigators''
of wars. However, it may be true at times, they say, that wars have
been a means for older leaders to deal with a surplus of young men
vying with them for a society's resources. Such wars, they add,
usually occur ``when a majority of the population reach some degree
of ideological consensus.''
</P>
<P>
   And since evolutionary theory also holds that women's best
strategy for reproducing _ and advancing their own kind _ is to
choose mates with enough resources to rear children, it's not
surprising that women have historically been the ones over whom the
wars have been fought, rather than the combatants, say the
scientists.
</P>
<P>
   The hypothesis is the work of Christian G. Mesquida, a graduate
student, and Neil I. Wiener, a professor in the psychology
department at York University in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   They described their analysis at the Boston conference and said
it could ultimately yield tools for identifying world regions ripe
for conflict before trouble breaks out. Even without further
refinement, the model hints at potential trouble in China, they
say, where a population imbalance favoring young males is fast
building. The evidence they've been gathering is so strong, they
contend, that it may prove that that an abundance of young males is
``a necessary condition for the emergence of violent conflicts.''
</P>
<P>
   Their hypothesis, presented at a session entitled ``Biology and
War,'' is one of many new approaches to explaining why human
societies are afflicted with war and violence. Mesquida said the
``young male'' explanation ``brings a new way to look at conflict _
from the bottom up instead of top-down.'' Better yet, it could
enable scientists to predict violence-prone areas, much as
geologists can identify areas where building tensions below ground
threaten to trigger earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   One caveat: the theory applies to offensive, not defensive,
wars. Thus the young US soldiers cut down during the Normandy
invasion in 1944 were not driven by the same biological imperatives
as the Nazi youth who helped carry Hitler into power.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will apply to the Iraqi army, not to the multi-national
force dispatched to contain it,'' say the authors of the study.
``It will apply to the European soldiers who conquered the
Americas'' but not the native peoples who opposed them.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe that rapid population growth shifts demographics so
that the proportion of young males (aged 15-29) rises in comparison
with older males,'' said Wiener. ``When these young males become a
large proportion of the population, violence is frequent and
severe.''
</P>
<P>
   Their study found that conflict was increasingly likely and
severe in countries where young men made up 35 percent to 55
percent of the population. In the US, the proportion is currently
less than 30 percent, they said.
</P>
<P>
   In their presentation to the meeting of the Association for
Politics and the Life Sciences, Wiener and Mesquida said they had
analyzed the conflict history of several groups of nations and
found a strong correlation between violent outbreaks and periods of
growth in the young male population.
</P>
<P>
   They also mapped the population demographics in major countries
of the world and wars and rebellions over the last decade, and
found a strong matching pattern. Most of the conflicts have
occurred in the developing world, where male youths are numerous as
populations expand, making the competition for resources such as
land, food and available mates more intense.
</P>
<P>
   This pattern has been at work in the Congo and Rwanda as well as
in Sudan, Algeria, and the former Yugoslavia, the scientists said.
Mesquida noted in an interview that young male fighters may not be
conscious that what they are doing is seeking resources in order to
compete for wives, but in evolutionary terms, that is their
fundamental motivation.
</P>
<P>
   Napoleon Chagnon, a prominent anthropologist at the University
of California in Santa Barbara, said the Canadian researchers'
theory is a new twist on what he's long believed. ``They've focused
on a very important category of individuals _ young unmarried
males, who become problems in all societies &UR; '' &LR;  and can be the
cause of instability and war.
</P>
<P>
   Chagnon said various societies _ including the Yanomamo people
of Brazil, whom he long studied _ have tried to defuse the danger
by creating backbreaking chores for young men or _ in the case of
medieval society _ by sending them off on the Crusades.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, the scientists noted, there's been no satisfactory
explanation for war, and many wars have been hard to predict,
including the revolution in Iran, the civil war in El Salvador, and
the invasion of Kuwait by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   As horrifying and destructive as war is, some evolutionary
psychologists say it can be seen as an adaptation. As a strategy
for acquiring the resources to mate and produce offspring, warring
against a neighbor furthers the evolutionary mission of preserving
and promulgating your own genetic endowment and that of your
relatives. This fits, the authors say, with the fact that ``all
violent group confrontations are perpetrated almost exclusively by
young males'' of reproductive age, most of them unmarried.
</P>
<P>
   While saying their work is not yet sufficiently developed to
make firm predictions, Mesquida said one country where conditions
may be brewing trouble is China, in part because a preference for
male children is creating a growing imbalance. Soon after the turn
of the century there is expected to be a million more young men
than young women.

INNOVATIVE HOSPITAL EFFORT REDUCES RATE OF CAESAREANS 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   When Mary Beckwith's labor pains started on August 21, the woman
headed straight for Lawrence (Mass.) General Hospital. The staff
sent her home.
</P>
<P>
   Malpractice? No, call it self-restraint _ a new and apparently
contagious attitude among some obstetricians and OB nurses that
might be characterized as ``stop me before I do another unnecessary
cesarean.''
</P>
<P>
   The practice of not admitting women to ``labor and delivery''
until their labors are progressing _ that is, until contractions
are strong, the womb is opening and its cervical neck thinning _ is
only one in a series of surprising recent changes in the policies
of dozens of US hospitals. But, obstetrical reformers say, it's one
of the most effective in reducing cesarean delivery rates, which
soared from an average of five percent in the 1970s to 25 percent
in the 1990s, and higher in some places.
</P>
<P>
   Sending women home until birth is imminent is important
symbolically too. It's a telling admission _ almost two decades
overdue, critics say _ that the American way of birth has become
mischievously over-medicalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women were made to give birth,'' says Susan Leavitt, Lawrence
General's nurse-manager of labor and delivery and a national leader
in the movement to reform obstetrics. ``We have a lot of technology
to save moms and babies with, but we don't need to apply it to
every mom who comes through the door.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a question of expectations. Admitting a woman to the
hospital starts a clock ticking.
</P>
<P>
   ``When patients come into the hospital and sit around for
extended periods with contractions, we feel we have to do
something,'' explains Dr. Roy Bors-Koefoed of St. Elizabeth's
Medical Center in Boston. ``The patient expects it, thinking `I
must be in labor.' So we do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leavitt says avoiding premature admissions has been a key factor
in her hospital's four-year reduction in cesarean rates, from 26
percent of all births to 17 percent. So far, nobody has delivered
at home or in the car, as some feared would happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past, we would rarely send patients home once they came
through our doors,'' Leavitt says. ``We were doing a lot of
cesareans on women not even in active labor yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Patients like it too, as long as they're carefully prepared for
what to expect. ``It's a useful and soothing thing to find out that
there's plenty of time and you can go back home and wait in
peace,'' says Beckwith, who was sent home at 4 p.m., returned at 7
when her contractions were getting strong. She delivered Jacob,
without the need for anesthesia, about 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Memorial is among 10 Massachusetts hospitals which
began four years ago to try to ``change the culture'' of
obstetrics, as Leavitt puts it, under a program sponsored by
Massachusetts Blue Cross/Blue Shield. Those 10 reduced their
average collective C-section rate from 25 percent in 1994 to 20
percent in 1997. The change may appear modest, but it translates
into hundreds fewer surgical births _ with no compromise in good
outcomes, participants say.
</P>
<P>
   During the same four-year period, the average hovered at 25 to
27 percent among a comparison group of 10 Bay State hospitals that
made no attempt to reduce their rates of surgical birth.
</P>
<P>
   As word has gotten around, the collective effort has gradually
expanded, to 27 hospitals by June of this year and 41 institutions
today _ all but 10 of the state's obstetrical units. Vermont, New
Hampshire, and Maine hospitals are engaged in a similar effort.
</P>
<P>
   The movement has gone national as well. So far 56 hospitals,
health plans, and health care provider networks have signed up to
take part in an intensive program to reduce cesareans run by the
Boston-based Institute for Healthcare Improvement.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, half of the 28 institutions that joined the
effort most recently have cut their cesarean rates by 25 percent or
more, reports Andrea Kabcenell, a Cornell University nurse who
directs the project. ``Every team has seen changes, but we've had
some really stellar outcomes _ more than 30 percent reductions,''
Kabcenell reports.
</P>
<P>
   Just as no individual woman's labor can be expected to follow a
textbook scenario, there is no cookbook recipe for reducing
unnecessary cesareans, she and others say. Measures that seem most
effective have emerged through trial and error. Some are simple _
for instance, abandoning the time-honored practice of giving
expectant couples a ``due date'' for the birth. Others are
technical, such as delaying epidural anesthesia or ending the
routine practice of hooking women to electronic fetal monitors
throughout labor.
</P>
<P>
   What the strategies share is a new thoughtfulness about
once-rigid expectations surrounding birth, and an overdue respect
for nature's ways.
</P>
<P>
   Take the due date, for example. It was always based on a
fallacy: the notion that an obstetrician could predict to the day
when the normal human 39-week gestation period would be up. But it
is almost always unclear when conception occurred. Even the wonders
of ultrasound _ which permits a more accurate but still uncertain
estimate of fetal weight and gestational age _ do not furnish the
precision that a due date implies.
</P>
<P>
   Setting a due date frequently leads to what Dr. Bruce Flamm, a
California obstetrician, calls ``a social induction,'' inducing
labor for social, not medical, reasons.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing medically wrong with mother or baby, but maybe
mother is tired of being pregnant, her husband is tired, her mother
has flown in from Minnesota,'' Flamm says. ``So the woman is
brought in, sometimes at her insistence, and they try to induce the
baby. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.''
</P>
<P>
   When it doesn't, the result is often an avoidable cesarean, with
risks and costs to the mother (such as surgical mishap, infection,
lengthier convalescence) and the baby (such as immature lungs).
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robert K. DeMott of Green Bay, Wis., one of the most
outspoken reformers, will only give couples a ``due month.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't dwell on a due date,'' DeMott advised Massachusetts
caregivers at a Blue Cross symposium recently. ``It just gets
everybody saying, `We're late! What are you going to do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Not everybody goes along with the idea of a ``due month.''
``Having had a pregnancy, I realize a lot of people can't swallow
that,'' Kabcenell says. ``People have lives to plan: When can I
tell the folks at work that I am not going to be working any more?
When should I tell Mom when she needs to come and help? When should
the baby's room be ready?''
</P>
<P>
   However, many obstetricians are now specifying only a two-week
interval when the birth might take place.
</P>
<P>
   Other changes involve how labor is managed once a woman is
admitted. Many obstetricians and OB nurses now respect the
importance of allow women to walk around during labor and to take
different positions _ even draped over a giant rubber ball in some
cases _ so gravity can assist the fetus's descent.
</P>
<P>
   But ambulation is impossible when the woman is continuously
tethered to electronic fetal monitors, and studies show that
intermittent monitoring is safe for the vast majority of women.
(Some, like DeMott, are even abandoning the monitors in favor of
the old-fashioned stethoscope to check on fetal heart rates.)
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, a woman can't walk around if an epidural anesthetic
has paralyzed her from the waist down. So some hospitals are
deferring epidurals until later in labor, after the cervix has
dilated at least four centimeters. In some cases, a lighter dose of
epidural anesthetic is used when necessary that allows the woman to
walk. Lawrence General has cancelled routine anesthesia
consultations because, Leavitt says, it creates ``a mind-set'' that
anesthesia will be needed.
</P>
<P>
   Later and lessened use of epidurals (which can slow labor),
along with increasing ambulation, turn out to reduce the occurrence
of the largest single justification for cesareans, called dystocia
or cephalopelvic disproportion _ meaning the baby is presumed to be
too large to fit through the mother's pelvis.
</P>
<P>
   The frequent fallacy of that belief has emerged from studies of
women who successfully delivered vaginally despite a prior cesarean
for cephalopelvic disproportion. ``Our success rate for vaginal
birth after cesarean is 80 to 90 percent,'' DeMott says, ``and
one-third of the babies weigh more than a previous child who
supposedly `got stuck.'''
</P>
<P>
   Despite hospitals' success in rolling back cesarean rates,
maintaining lower rates is a constant struggle.
</P>
<P>
   The ideal of ``natural'' or unmedicated childbirth, so much in
vogue during the 1980s, has waned, so many women now need to be
persuaded that they may not need an epidural. ``Today the culture
is, `I want my epidural the minute I get into the hospital,'''
Flamm says. ``You have to change that attitude.''
</P>
<P>
   The legal climate is a factor too. Although there is less
tendency to conclude that every case of cerebral palsy or brain
damage is a flag for a cesarean-that-should-have-been-done, a new
development has the reformers worried.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jeffrey Phelan, a California obstetrician-lawyer, is
campaigning against vaginal birth after cesarean (so-called VBACs)
as inherently unsafe, since in one case out of 100 the woman's
prior uterine scar ruptures. Phelan has persuaded some malpractice
insurers and health plans to circulate ominous informed consent
forms to doctors detailing the dangers, urging that tey get women
to sign the form before trying VBAC.
</P>
<P>
   Flamm says no studies back up Phelan's contention, and that it
is seldom disastrous when uterine scars give way.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason this is a big issue is when you look at cesarean
rates over the last 10 years, there are now 100,000 fewer cesareans
each year, and almost all of those are due to VBACs,'' Flamm says.
``If we start going back to the era of `Once a cesarean, always a
cesarean,' we may see that turning around.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 BOSTON: ... Robert Spano.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Controversies about Ozawa have tended to fall into several
categories; it is not an accident that his most important
achievements fall into those same categories.
</P>
<P>
   First and most basic is his artistic profile. Listeners with
other tastes and priorities have always found him deficient, and
probably always will. Ozawa is still good at what he has always
been good at _ the big repertory, anything flamboyant, colorful, or
theatrical; the major works of the early 20th century; and new
music. He is superb in music with a strong rhythmic profile (ballet
scores by Tchaikovsky, Prokofiev, Ravel, Stravinsky, and Bartok),
and he can be surpassingly supple and sensitive in music requiring
charm or coloristic allure. Works of strong religious or antiwar
sentiment attract him strongly. He has a strong rhythmic sense, a
feeling for melody, an outstanding ear, an understanding of
structure, and bravado.
</P>
<P>
   No one is going to give a composer a better first performance
than Ozawa. He has often been criticized for insufficient
commitment to new music, although he's led more of it than any
other celebrity-level conductor of his generation. He has conducted
35 commisioned works during his tenure at the BSO _ 12 were
commissioned for the orchestra's centennial in 1981, and more are
expected for the forthcoming centennial of Symphony Hall _ as well
as many contemporary works not commissioned by the orchestra. In
his youth, he sought out senior masters like Messiaen and
Lutoslawski, and he still does that; Henri Dutilleux and Michael
Tippett recently delivered career-crowning masterpieces to the BSO.
Throughout his career, Ozawa consistently promoted the music of his
friend Toru Takemitsu, who was only five years older. One could
wish for a more substantial commitment to new American music, but
over the years Ozawa has conducted new or recent works by Antoniou,
Cage, Carter, Chihara, Crumb, DelTredici, Druckman, Foss, Harbison,
Kirchner, Kolb, Lieberson, Martino, Perle, Rands, Rochberg,
Schuller, Sessions, Starer, Thomas, Walker, Wilson, and Zwilich.
Real advocacy may be missing _ would it have been better to
concentrate on four or five of these composers, and regularly
introduce all of their new works? _ but this list does cover a lot
of territory.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, one can say that no conductor is equally good in
everything _ Koussevitzky wasn't a born Mozartean either, and the
composers Ozawa has difficulties with are the very ones most other
conductors of today have trouble with too. Also a conductor today
has to know a lot more music than any of the legendary maestros of
early in this century: music of the baroque period, and 100 years'
worth of new pieces.
</P>
<P>
   There are things Ozawa was never particularly good at that are
still not among his strongest points _ the repertory of the
classical period in general, and Mozart in particular, although he
can be challenged by a soloist like Peter Serkin or Maria Tipo into
first-class Mozart. One of Ozawa's most remarkable qualities is his
capacity for continuing growth; some things he was not good at
before have slowly but steadily become better. No one hearing his
Mozart ``Cosi fan tutte'' at Tanglewood in 1970 could possibly have
predicted his superb ``Falstaff'' in 1992 _ Seiji Ozawa made
himself into an opera conductor. His early Mahler performances were
stylistically unsure, but now he knows exactly what he wants. He is
still fired by the ambition to keep learning music he hasn't
learned before. A while back he conducted ``The Barber of Seville''
in Japan just for the fun of it; once he casually mentioned that he
was learning Alban Berg's ``Lulu'' simply because he wanted to _
there was no prospect of a performance. At Tanglewood, he conducted
unforgettable performances of Britten's ``Peter Grimes,'' a work
generally regarded as the special preserve of British conductors,
which he is unlikely to be invited to conduct elswhere.
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Ozawa is remarkably free of personal jealousy. In
the early years, there was some conflict over repertory and
recording with principal guest conductor Colin Davis, but today
Ozawa enjoys cordial relationships with most of his podium
colleagues, and the BSO boasts the most prestigious roster of guest
conductors of any American orchestra. Ozawa no longer feels
compelled to do things that do not represent him at his best; he
does feel compelled to have those things done by people who excel
at them. Persuading Bernard Haitink to accept the position of
principal guest conductor was a major coup of the Ozawa era.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa is a loyal man, and the BSO has built a remarkable
relationship with a number of soloists and guest artists, some of
whom, like Peter Serkin, Jessye Norman, and Frederica von Stade,
have enjoyed career-long associations with Ozawa _ Yo-Yo Ma first
played with Ozawa when he was 13. With James Levine, Ozawa is
probably the best accompanist in the business today, as Eugene
Ormandy was in the generation before. Ozawa will follow a soloist
he respects anywhere he or she wants to go _ he has given great
performances of Beethoven's ``Emperor'' Concerto with pianists as
diverse as Rudolf Serkin, Russell Sherman, and Dubravka Tomsic.
Ozawa considered his collaboration with Serkin on the Beethoven
Concerto cycle one of the greatest learning experiences for himself
and the orchestra (``We grew up together,'' he said at the time).
The only problem is that the company of regulars has now grown so
large it's very hard for a newcomer to break in, although, after
her 1992 debut, violinist Pamela Frank became one of the family
almost immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Some Ozawa-era controversies were intense _ the most famous of
them was the 1982 cancellation of the performances of Stravinsky's
``Oedipus Rex,'' scheduled to be narrated by Vanessa Redgrave, on
the grounds of public-safety issues that arose because of the
actress's pro-Palestinian views. Redgrave sued and lost, but the
BSO did not occupy high moral ground during the controversy.
</P>
<P>
   Others controversies continue. Badly scarred by a personnel
battle at the San Francisco Symphony early in his career that
turned into a racial-sexual controversy, Ozawa is sometimes slow to
make decisions; he has been particularly cautious after making a
couple of wrong choices for exposed positions in the BSO. It took
nearly nearly a decade to find a successor to former BSO principal
flute Doriot Anthony Dwyer, although to be fair, two successors
were chosen who turned the job down, including the superb player
who finally changed his mind and took it, Jacques Zoon. On the
other hand, Ozawa has sometimes said ``Bingo'' on the spot, and
he's been right _ he has made some superior appointments to the
orchestra, and some of his choices, like principal bass Edwin
Barker, bid fair to become as legendary as some of the great
players Ozawa inherited (timpanist Everett Firth is now the last of
them). The moment when every section of every orchestra is at peak
form comes only rarely _ it's an organic function of youth and age,
experience and eagerness, contractual protections, individual
talent, and commitment to an ensemble ideal. Nevertheless, it's
safe to say that player for player, the current BSO is competitive
with any of its previous incarnations, and that under Ozawa the
orchestra has developed capacities for the heavier German repertory
that it formerly lacked, and without losing the coloristic finesse
that has been its principal glory since before Ozawa's birth.
</P>
<P>
   Orchestral morale is difficult to assess, even when internal
controversies become public, as they did a couple of years ago when
the concertmaster and principal cellist published a letter
virtually calling for Ozawa's resignation. It is built into their
situation that orchestra players will have ambivalent feelings
about their music director and boss; Ozawa has remained fluid,
while some attitudes toward him have become fixed. What matters is
that the BSO will deliver Ozawa whatever he asks for _ and it is
capable of delivering what any guest conductor wants too.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa has never let himself be drawn into arguments with the
press and music critics; he always speaks levelly, honestly, and
forthrightly to members of the press, no matter what they have
recently been saying about him. He once amiably slipped into a
Japanese hot tub alongside this writer, something one cannot
imagine Bernstein or Karajan doing. He hasn't gone out of his way
to court the public, although he appears in public all the time,
and not just in Symphony Hall _ he's often been sighted in Fenway
Park and Foxboro Stadium. Everett Firth has pointed out that Ozawa
conducts the national anthem as seriously as he conducts the Mahler
Ninth. He has fluctuated in temporary favor, but over the years he
also has won lasting affection and esteem, which is harder to
achieve than a standing ovation after a performance. That earned
public esteem has made it possible for Ozawa to work effectively
with his board and management to secure the BSO's future in an
unpromising environment of governmental indifference, corporate
greed, and an aging and dwindling public for any form of serious
endeavor. The Ozawa era has seen several significant increases in
the BSO's endowment, the acquisition of important real estate both
in Boston and at Tanglewood, the ongoing restoration of Symphony
Hall, and the construction of Ozawa Hall at Tanglewood. John
Williams and Keith Lockhart have reason to appreciate that Ozawa
has taken a more direct and supportive interest in the Boston Pops
than any of his predecessors as music director; Ozawa knows that it
is in his own interest for the Pops to operate on a high artistic
level. None of this would have been possible without the public
support earned by his day-to-day achievement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a long journey from his first Mahler Third in 1977 to the
ones last season, an even longer journey from that debut
performance of the Bizet Symphony at Tanglewood to the Beethoven
Ninth that opens the season this week. Ozawa's journey has been of
little steps forward, some sliding back, some great leaps forward;
at every stage of the way it has been a rewarding, fully human
journey, with music as the lodestone for the compass. Because of
that, listening to Ozawa and measuring him has been a way of
measuring ourselves.

MIDLER GOES BACK TO THE BATHHOUSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE MORSE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The song may be from 1935 or 1955 or 1998, but if Bette Midler
likes it, she's going to sing it. The song could be campy, serious,
sad, or a combination thereof, but it's not going to stop her.
Where other artists might lay claim to versatility, the Divine Miss
M simply defines it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why shouldn't I have an open mind?'' says Midler, appalled at
the idea of anything else.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel bad for people who only like one kind of music,'' adds
Midler, whose new album, ``Bathhouse Betty,'' sassily spans songs
from '30s standard ``I Sold My Heart to the Junkman'' to
contemporary tunes by pop pianist Ben Folds and singer-songwriter
Adam Cohen, son of Leonard Cohen (who is also represented, with the
``Song of Bernadette'').
</P>
<P>
   Midler, 52, doesn't hesitate to thank her audience for
encouraging her to pursue such diverse styles. ``My audience has
been great about that,'' she says from Los Angeles. ``They like
music. They don't look down their nose at people because they don't
make a certain kind of music. ... They have respect for musicians
and they have respect for arrangers.''
</P>
<P>
   It's no surprise that Midler, like many artists of her
generation, can't fathom the constricting, subset-of-a-subset
formats that constitute many of today's radio stations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think for the most part that radio stinks,'' says Midler,
whose versatility is surpassed only by her candor. ``All this
demographic stuff and all this marketing stuff where they will only
play a certain kind of music and you can't be older than 25 to get
on the station is nuts. I think it makes for a very ignorant
audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Her new album has a couple of awkward moments, including a
tentative treatment of ``Song of Bernadette,'' but for the most
part, her so-called ``cosmic fabulosity'' is on full,
mind-expanding display. She moves easily from the rib-tickling,
1955 tune ``One Monkey Don't Stop No Show'' (``He left me at 3 in
the morning, I got me a man at 4,'' she wails, backed by the Royal
Crown Revue) to the jazz-swing of ``I'm Hip'' and the dance-funk of
``I'm Beautiful,'' which even has her rapping some phrases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very little rapping. You even call that rapping?'' she asks
kiddingly.
</P>
<P>
   Well, it's not going to be confused with Puff Daddy, she's told.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, now, wait a second. I can rap as well as Puff Daddy. He
can hardly rap. Now that girl, Li'l Kim, she raps. She speed-raps.
I couldn't do that. Well, maybe I could if I had enough practice.''
</P>
<P>
   The album's diversity is most apparent in a segue from Adam
Cohen's ``Lullaby in Blue'' (a poignant tale of a parent missing a
child) to the hilarious ``Ukulele Lady.'' Perhaps only Midler could
make these two songs work back to back.
</P>
<P>
   The album title, ``Bathhouse Betty,'' refers to her days singing
in gay bathhouses in Manhattan, long before she became a
show-business icon. The title was chosen only after a crazed
incident in which an overzealous fan knocked on the door to her
house in Orange County and started shouting ``Bathhouse Betty!
Bathhouse Betty!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was scared,'' she recalls. ``He was extremely disreputable.
He looked like he had spent the night in the park. He had picked
some wildflowers, bless his heart, but I didn't let him in. ... I
called the police. I was scared, because I was all alone at the
time. The police couldn't find him, but he left me the title of my
album, so I guess I should be grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   Midler has no tour plans, because she's been preoccupied with
finishing her next film, ``Isn't She Great?'' It's the story of
pulp writer Jacqueline Susann (played by Midler) and the romance
between her and Irving Mansfield. It also stars Nathan Lane, with a
script by Paul Rudnick. ``It's very strange, but it's pretty
funny,'' Midler says of the film, due to be released next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I play Jacqueline Susann in a long brown wig, but don't tell
anybody it's a wig! They'll never know,'' says Midler, who
obviously still has a few tricks up her divine sleeve.

SEIJI OZAWA'S COMPLEX AND REWARDING JOURNEY 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In 1960, a young music student from Tokyo's Toho School
heard the Boston Symphony Orchestra for the first time. Seiji Ozawa
was 25 when he saw Charles Munch conduct the BSO in Berlioz's
``Symphonie fantastique'' on tour, and he can still recall details
of that performance today. Postwar Japan had never heard an
orchestra of comparable quality; hearing the Boston Symphony
confirmed Ozawa's ambition to become a conductor.
</P>
<P>
   Thirty-eight years later, Ozawa is celebrating his
25th-anniversary season as music director of the BSO _ his tenure
now matches that of his most celebrated predecessor, Serge
Koussevitzky, and now surpasses that of any other leading music
director in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa was 38 when he was named music director; today he is 63,
and the last quarter-century has seen major changes in the man, the
orchestra, the city, and the society. He has survived personal
crises, public controversy, and calls for his resignation; he has
taken the orchestra on historic tours to China, Japan, South
America, and the European festivals, and conducted more than 1,400
concerts, some of them unassailably great.
</P>
<P>
   At points along the way Ozawa must have grown tired of constant
comparisons with Koussevitzky; once when a critic threw the name of
Koussevitzky in the face of Sir Georg Solti in Chicago, the
conductor irritably replied, ``Get him back, then!'' Ozawa doesn't
lose his temper in public like that, but he's always known he has
to go his own way, and not someone else's. Not every personal
relationship with members of the orchestra and staff has gone
smoothly; Ozawa does not like to be crossed. But he does not shirk
from difficult decisions, and he has learned to live with their
consequences. It has been a long journey, complicated, difficult,
rewarding, and, above all, richly human.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa was born to Japanese parents in Manchuria in 1935. The
family returned to Japan when he was 5 years old. The first music
Ozawa performed in public was American spirituals and hymns from a
little collection given to him by GIs. With his brothers, he formed
the Golden Gate Gospel Quartet _ recently Ozawa surprised
filmmakers preparing a tribute for this week's opening of his
25th-anniversary season by bursting into the refrain of ``What a
Friend We Have in Jesus.'' From the age of 7 he had taken piano
lessons; a teenage soccer accident, which broke two of his fingers,
led him to concentrate on composition and conducting instead of
hoping for a keyboard career.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from the Toho School in 1959, Ozawa followed
the advice of his teacher, Hideo Saito, and went to Europe; it took
him 63 days on a freighter from Kobe, Japan, to Messina, Italy.
Ozawa passed the time by forming and rehearsing a male chorus from
the ship's crew. Subsidized by the Subaru motorbike company, Ozawa
was on his way to a conducting competition in Besancon, France _
which he won, attracting the attention of two members of the jury:
Eugene Bigot, who became his teacher, and Munch, who became his
mentor, suggesting that he come to study at the Tanglewood Music
Center.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa came to Tanglewood in the summer of 1960, traveling by
Greyhound from Logan Airport. He tasted his first pizza and lived
in the world of the Boston Symphony Orchestra; Munch coached him in
Debussy's ``La Mer,'' and urged him to be more supple. Events moved
quickly after that. Ozawa won the Karajan Competition in Germany
and became assistant to the maestro; in Berlin, he met Leonard
Bernstein, who agreed to see him because of a letter of
recommendation from the widow of former BSO music director Serge
Koussevitzky. Bernstein invited Ozawa to become his own assistant
in New York, and Karajan _ Bernstein's great rival _ urged Ozawa to
take advantage of the opportunity. Ozawa is the only protege of
both of the two most famous conductors of mid-century.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa made his debut with the New York Philharmonic in 1961;
three years later, he returned to Tanglewood to conduct the Boston
Symphony Orchestra for the first time, replacing the legendary
Pierre Monteux, who had died earlier in the summer. The next year
he became music director of the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, and in
1970 he took over the San Francisco Symphony _ the same year that
he became co-artistic director at Tanglewood. From the beginning,
Ozawa's extraordinary talents were obvious. Even his sharpest
critics admit that his musical memory is unique, and the musicians
among them openly envy it. No less remarkable is his physical gift
for conducting, his technical ability to make complex rhythms clear
and to communicate musical detail and emotional nuance in
unambiguous, graceful, and expressive gesture.
</P>
<P>
   In his first years with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, there
were doubts about Ozawa's musical maturity _ he was, after all,
still in his 30s. He didn't give much thought to image, but his
long hair, tunics, and love beads created a trendy one for him that
didn't exactly fit; he had a reputation for flashiness, but he was
always profoundly serious. His acquiescence to record company
agendas that promoted him primarily in showpieces was also probably
a mistake; later Ozawa regretted those first recordings of Ravel
and Respighi because they delayed public acceptance of his work in
more substantial repertory. As always when surfaces are so
dazzling, Ozawa was criticized for offering surface without
substance. In Japan, Ozawa was sometimes treated as a prophet
without honor; in America and Europe, he, like other musicians from
the Pacific Rim, encountered prejudice from those who did not
believe an Asian could understand or master the subtleties of
Western music. That he should be asked in later years to conduct
the Vienna Philharmonic in Mahler, to record Wagner with the Berlin
Philharmonic, came as a vindication.
</P>
<P>
   Also, in the BSO Ozawa had inherited a great institution from
his predecessors Munch, Erich Leinsdorf, and William Steinberg, and
an immensely authoritative concertmaster, Joseph Silverstein. Ozawa
felt a great deference to the senior musicians and to the
orchestra; it was only later, when he himself was older and the
orchestra was filled with players he had chosen himself, that he
felt he could exert his full authority _ today all but 22 members
of the orchestra, a full 80 percent, are his appointees.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the '70s, the honeymoon for Ozawa and the
orchestra had ended. Ozawa had survived, barely, some trials by
fire (the Salzburg Festival is not the place to try conducting a
Mozart opera for the first time) and was under managerial pressure
to keep building his career, although he already stood at the top
of his profession. He was also driven by his own curiosity and
ambition; his work had primarily been in the concert hall, and he
wanted to know the operatic world. Bernard Haitink was praised for
comparable curiosity, but Ozawa ran into a lot of flak _ he was
attacked for being a dilettante in opera and for neglecting detail
in his symphonic work.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ozawa had grown concerned that his children Seira and
Yukiyoshi were turning into Americans, unable to communicate with
their own grandmother in her own language, so he made the decision
to send his family back to Tokyo _ a decision that was made at
considerable psychological cost, because Ozawa is a deeply
committed family man, and at physical cost too, because of all the
extra in-flight time this added to his life. Because Ozawa was
overcommitted in every dimension of his life, his relationship with
the BSO suffered; some programming became questionable, and the
musical level of his performances became erratic.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-'80s, however, things began slowly to change. The
children grew up, went to school, became independent. Ozawa
suffered a ski accident that was career-threatening; he could
barely lift his arms above his shoulders. Meanwhile, beloved
friends and members of his family had died; so did his mentors
Karajan and Bernstein.
</P>
<P>
   As his 60th birthday loomed and passed, a new concentration and
emotional depth appeared in his conducting _ although some of his
perpetual critics failed to hear it. Ozawa also began to be
increasingly concerned with what his own legacy might be, and with
how he could possibly repay the debts he owed to his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   He began in Japan in 1984, by creating the Saito Kinen Orchestra
in memory of his first teacher, and in 1992 by establishing the
Saito Kinen Festival, which is modeled, in part, on Tanglewood.
This was widely applauded; more controversial were the steps he
took to repay the debt to his BSO predecessors by taking decisive
action two years ago to redirect the Tanglewood Music Center _ his
purpose, widely misunderstood, was not to damage the celebrated
chamber music activity and devalue those who were running it, but
to restore other dimensions of the traditional program that had
either faltered or disappeared. In Boston, he began mentoring a
whole sequence of talented assistant conductors, the way Bernstein
and Karajan had mentored him, and he formed a special bond with the
most gifted of them, Robert Spano.

SEIJI OZAWA'S OTHER LIFE IN JAPAN 
</HEADLINE>
 TAKES-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By INDIRA A.R. LAKSHMANAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MATSUMOTO, Japan _ Yuji Takei remembers the exact date in 1964
when he was first awed by a 28-year-old Seiji Ozawa, and that
impression has only deepened over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa, the first Japanese to win international conducting prizes
and lead major Western orchestras, was arguably already too famous
and busy to direct a small-town ensemble. But Ozawa ``is not
someone who could turn down the request of (his) teacher,'' Takei
said, so the young conductor flew from North America to lead an
amateur orchestra in the Japanese town of Suwa.
</P>
<P>
   Takei, who was a violinist there, says he was bowled over. ``I
was struck by Ozawa not only as a musician, but as a human being.
He has the energy of a steam locomotive and the ability to pull
everyone in his direction. He can make friends with anyone, and he
never pulls back or lowers his standards, regardless of the level
of people he is dealing with.''
</P>
<P>
   It is hard to imagine any place where the exuberant,
shaggy-haired maestro could be a more famous and familiar face than
in his adopted hometown, where he celebrates 25 years as music
director of the Boston Symphony Orchestra this season. But if such
a place exists, it is Japan _ a place he left long ago, but never
really abandoned.
</P>
<P>
   This is a nation whose top orchestra sent a young Ozawa packing
35 years ago, rejecting him as brash and immature. Ozawa left
humiliated and brokenhearted, thinking he would never return to
make music here. But his career rocketed abroad and the acclaim for
his skills grew so dramatically that even his erstwhile critics
here eventually recognized him as one of the world's great
conductors.
</P>
<P>
   Today, it is hard to overestimate Ozawa's star appeal in Japan.
He is widely known as a ``national treasure,'' counting among his
fans the emperor and empress of Japan, Nobel laureates, and
chairmen of major corporations. He is hailed as a pioneer among
postwar Japanese trying to achieve global recognition in a
Western-dominated field. He is recognized on streets and subways.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most striking, in a country famous for setting high
standards for itself, Ozawa's lifestyle _ his reputed long hours,
constant striving for excellence, dedication to community, and
generosity to family, friends, and fans _ has become a role model
for his public. Ozawa's persona in Japan has gone beyond
``maestro'' to ``sensei'' _ the Japanese term for a teacher or
great man.
</P>
<P>
   In the way that Michael Jordan is a uniquely American icon, the
63-year-old Ozawa represents everything that many Japanese want to
be. He works tremendously hard, but without sacrificing fun or his
personal life. He's internationally recognized, but seems to have
remained humble and determined to give back to society.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here come to his concerts who don't know much
about music _ academics, politicians, company presidents,'' said
Takei, a retired Epson executive who now coordinates the annual
Saito Kinen music festival, named for Ozawa's teacher, Hideo Saito.
Ozawa founded the festival in 1992 to bring world-class
performances and teaching to his homeland.
</P>
<P>
   Especially in the most recent decade of Ozawa's life, his
profile has risen in Japan as his activities here have multiplied _
teaching at his alma mater Toho School of Music in Tokyo, guest
conducting at the New Japan Philharmonic, leading ``caravans'' that
bring free, live music to remote areas, and conducting programs
with amateurs and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a rock star here,'' said an incredulous Everett
``Vic'' Firth, BSO timpanist, and one of the few artists not of
Japanese descent who is part of the Saito Kinen Orchestra. On the
street here, children chase Ozawa for autographs or stop him to
offer an apple or other small token.
</P>
<P>
   ``After World War II, he was the first Japanese who went abroad
and made it. We always tried to chase European or American culture,
to imitate it, but Maestro Ozawa was the first to make it,'' said
Chiyoshige Matsubara, managing director of the New Japan
Philharmonic. ``After him, it's much easier to come out and make it
abroad. For the pioneer, it's always the most difficult.'' For
Ozawa, that was oddly more true at home than abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After touring Japan as assistant conductor to Bernstein's New
York Philharmonic, Ozawa was contracted in 1963 for six months as
music director of the NHK Symphony, Japan's most prestigious
classical ensemble. It was a startling appointment for a
27-year-old, and one that ended miserably.
</P>
<P>
   Critics at the time said Ozawa was too green for the job. He was
accused of being late for rehearsals, and of not knowing the music.
He reputedly once asked the concertmaster to signal him when the
orchestra was to come in during a concerto, because he hadn't
memorized the cadenza. At NHK, resentment against the young
conductor simmered until players boycotted a performance, leaving
Ozawa standing alone onstage, angry and humiliated.
</P>
<P>
   Defenders say the real problem was the Japanese attitude towards
noncomformists, and a generational clash between old and new
values.
</P>
<P>
   Yoshihisa Sasaki, a music critic who has followed Ozawa's
career, said the young conductor's rise in the '60s coincided with
the beginning of Japan's economic miracle and the end of its
postwar humiliation. With his dark glasses, tight pants, and
Beatles haircut, Ozawa ``was hip and cool, not dark and brooding,''
Sasaki said. ``He was the incarnation of the hopes of young
Japanese. But Japanese organizations have a tendency to be mean to
young people, and Ozawa fought back.''

   TAKE-BOS  
 MATSUMOTO, Japan: ... fought back.''  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is a Japanese saying that ``the nail that sticks out gets
hammered down,'' and people often quote it when speaking of Ozawa's
early reception here. His conducting style was loose and powerful,
a far cry from the restrained style to which NHK was accustomed. He
used informal and direct language when speaking. He didn't follow
seniority within NHK's ranks and was criticized for bringing
friends and his first wife, pianist Kyoko Edo, to rehearsals. He
was resented for having leapfrogged over other conductors, and some
players hazed him by missing notes and complaining if he didn't
notice.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the small-mindedness of Japanese _ they couldn't
recognize someone who was very, very good, but came from nowhere.
He was much a hippie type, with long hair, and NHK was not used to
a conductor like that,'' recalled Tadashi Hori, 63, a violinist at
Saito Kinen and a friend of Ozawa's since they were in music school
together as teenagers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The style of his performance was very unusual, perhaps
unprecedented in Japan,'' said Moto Hirasa, Ozawa's manager here
since 1976. ``In Japanese organizations, there's always a hierarchy
and elders have to be respected. When this young man came in and
said, `I don't care who's older or younger, but who has ability,'
there was a lot of confusion.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I was too young. They thought I was too American _ but I
didn't even speak English then,'' Ozawa said with a laugh, while
driving himself to a concert recently at Saito Kinen.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was sad, but I also made many friends,'' he said of the
Japanese artistic giants who at the time signed a letter defending
him. ``I learned quickly how difficult the world is, how hard it is
to come back to your country. If they had made me NHK director, it
would have been comfortable: good money, a house. But in Japan, I
don't think I would've grown as a conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   So Ozawa went West, and earned posts and increasing fame in
Chicago, Toronto, San Francisco, and, finally, Boston.
</P>
<P>
   It was his talent and personality, but also his early
difficulties here, that have drawn other Japanese innovators to
him. His close friends include clothing designer Hanae Mori, the
only Japanese woman to enter haute couture ranks in Paris;
Nobel-winning author Kenzaburo Oe; late composer Toru Takemitsu;
late writer Yukio Mishima; and Sony chairman Norio Ohga.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a time when some Japanese audiences ... did not
appreciate, even notice, the talent of Japanese artists, only
admiring foreign artists just because they were foreign,'' Ohga
said. ``Seiji complelely changed that. The fact that US and
European audiences appreciated his talent led the way for his
followers to be recognized. The incident with NHK was a good
awakening for him. Without it, he may have remained only an
ordinary Japanese conductor.''
</P>
<P>
   Hirasa agreed. ``Japanese Nobel winners, actors, baseball, and
soccer players have all gone overseas. When we hear a Japanese has
gone abroad and reaped approval, it's as if every Japanese shares
in that success.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Ozawa has called Boston home for a quarter-century, but
Japanese still claim him as their own. For his part, Ozawa seems to
have struggled little with identity, choosing instead to embrace
both communities.
</P>
<P>
   He never took American citizenship, but says ``we'' when he
speaks of Americans. He spends 12 to 15 weeks a year working or
vacationing in Japan, and for the last 20 years has kept a home and
centered his personal life here, after he and his wife decided she
would move back so their son and daughter could be educated and
rooted in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, in the same way that some Japanese have criticized
Sony Corp. for being too American, too much a cultural hybrid, some
feel Ozawa has become too Westernized, too direct in his style and
language _ supposedly addressing even the empress informally. But
many, especially young Japanese, say that hybrid quality is an
asset, a sign of casting aside outdated values that have hemmed in
this society.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa says when he lands at Logan International Airport, he
feels like he is home, and not just because he is an avid Red Sox
and Patriots fan. ``My house is there, my study, my life's work. I
understand that Boston people feel I am their partner, and I also
feel at home there. BSO and I are like family now. They're so
accustomed to me; I'm like Papa. I love them. But I never lost my
contact with Japan, because I am really Japanese _ and not just
because I like Japanese food or drink,'' he chuckled.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps because Saito Kinen reunites him with Toho classmates,
the festival is a window onto the Japanese side of Ozawa. It is
also the place where the qualities for which he is revered in Japan
_ professional perfectionism and personal warmth _ coexist most
harmoniously. ``
</P>
<P>
   Ikuko Mizuno, a violinist with the BSO and Saito Kinen and Toho
classmate, said, ``Everyone thinks I'm crazy to use my vacation to
work with the same conductor. But here he is testing us to see what
we want. He's experimenting. That's why this is heaven for him _ he
can work to perfection.''
</P>
<P>
   Connecting with children has become a large part of Ozawa's work
here. Having passed 60 and surpassed the tenure of any current
orchestra leader in America, he seems to have decided the most
important contribution he can make is to develop classical music
teaching and culture, especially in Japan. ``It would be a big
mistake if I didn't teach, because Mr. Saito was so important to
me. I can't be like Saito, but we should do something, leave
something after we die, like lime in the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of that has been the caravans he initiated with Russian
cellist Mstislav Rostropovich. The two have taken music students
and driven through the Japanese countryside, stopping in three
towns a day to play free music on street corners or in temples,
taking meals with the locals.
</P>
<P>
   Music critic Sasaki said Ozawa's appeal may also lie beyond
himself, in a desire by Japanese to find something exemplary in
their culture amid recent financial and political turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan has based its postwar reputation on its economic sucess,
but that success is now in decline,'' Sasaki said. ``So when you
wonder what does modern Japan have left, Seiji Ozawa is the epitome
of what Japan has to be proud of.''

INSURERS TIGHTEN STANDARDS FOR INFERTILITY CLINICS

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON - With their eye on the bottom line, medical directors of
managed-care organizations have begun taking a sharp look at
performance of infertility clinics in Massachusetts. Their aim,
they say, is to ensure that patients get the most effective
treatment without high rates of costly multiple pregnancies.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Tufts Health Plan, New England's second-largest managed
care company, has put three programs on notice that if they want to
win contracts, they'll have to improve.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Robin Richman, medical director for fertility services at
Tufts, said that as the plan began looking for potential IVF
providers, ``I noticed that success rates have been very different,
and so has the philosophy on counseling patients, how quickly they
move to different techniques, and, frankly, how honest they've been
with their patients. It's very variable.'' She would not identify
the plans that have been warned.
</P>
<P>
   One frequently quoted statistic, on the odds that a woman will
end up with a live birth, varied from 8 to 21 percent among clinics
according to 1995 data, Richman said.
</P>
<P>
   The Tufts plan has devised a set of benchmarks for IVF programs.
They combine a number of figures, including the clinic's success
rate; the number of IVF cycles, or attempts, carried out annually;
the rate of multiple pregnancies; the number of doctors in the
program as well as those who are board-certified; and the
laboratory director's credentials.
</P>
<P>
   Richman said three Massachusetts programs are currently below
the standard but have until Jan. 1 to reach it. Dr. Machelle Seibel
at Faulkner Hospital acknowledged that his program is one of the
three.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's causing problems for me, and I'm working on solutions,''
he said. ``They have a broad range of requirements that don't
necessarily relate to patient care. I'm simply confused by where
these criteria come from.''
</P>
<P>
   Donald Desmarais, vice president of a physicians' management
company affiliated with Reproductive Science Center of Waltham,
said he welcomes standards. Managed-care companies ``are becoming
enlightened,'' he said.

<P>
   Five years ago, while visiting his native Korea, physicist
Zang-Hee Cho took a tumble down a hiking trail.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were in the mountains for a picnic, and my shoes were not
quite correct,'' recalls the 62-year-old professor from the
University of California at Irvine. ``I was thinking, as usual, and
I fell down. It was like a flight, like a big jump down the
mountain. The next day I returned to California and tried to stand
up after 12 hours on the plane. I couldn't stand up. I said,
'Uh-oh, big trouble.'''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't long before Cho began to look for some relief from the
pain in his back. Relatives suggested he try acupuncture. Though he
initially scoffed at the idea _ as an educated person, he says, he
didn't believe in acupuncture _ he tried it. And much to his
surprise, it worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``After about 10 minutes I felt the pain melting away.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho's unexpected relief prodded his professional curiosity. As a
physicist working in radiology, Cho develops ways to image the
complex inner workings of the body. One of his inventions was a
prototype PET scanner around 1975.
</P>
<P>
   How, he wondered, could inserting needles into seemingly random
points on the body possibly affect human health?
</P>
<P>
   He decided to take a closer look, and what he found astounded
him. While sticking needles into a few student volunteers, he took
pictures of their brains and discovered that by stimulating an
acupuncture point said to be associated with vision _ but that is
nowhere near anything known to be connected to the eyes _ he could
indeed trigger activity in the very part of the brain that controls
vision.
</P>
<P>
   There just might be something to this acupuncture thing, he
figured.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture and other forms of traditional Chinese medicine have
been around for more than 4,000 years. Yet the explanation for how
acupuncture _ and Chinese medicine as a whole _ works has long been
a mystery, if not an object of mockery, for most Western doctors.
</P>
<P>
   The basic theory is outlined in a text from 200 B.C., attributed
to the Yellow Emperor (a mythical ruler). In brief, it recognizes
in people and in nature a vital energy or life force known as qi
(pronounced CHEE).
</P>
<P>
   Qi is the source of movements ranging from voluntary muscle
action to blood flow; it protects the body from external
influences, and it generates warmth.
</P>
<P>
   Qi flows through the body and to the organs by way of an
extensive system of channels known as meridians. If the flow of the
force is disturbed, the theory goes, the resulting deficiency,
excess or stagnation of qi causes bodily malfunction and thus
illness.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture, in which needles are inserted into specific points
along the meridians and manipulated, is said to restore the proper
flow of qi and thereby return the body to health.
</P>
<P>
   Practitioners recognize some 1,500 acupoints, most of which have
no obvious relationship to their intended targets. For example, a
point on the second toe is used to treat headaches and toothaches,
while a point near the elbow enhances the immune system.
</P>
<P>
   Another integral concept is the tension between two
ever-present, complementary forces of nature, yin and yang. When
their balance is disturbed, the theory goes, people get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Yin conditions reflect a lack of qi: pale face, cold
extremities, slow pulse, depression. Yang conditions result from an
excess of qi: red face, fever, fast pulse, agitation.
</P>
<P>
   What those researchers have been able to measure is a flow of
acupuncture induced endorphins. According to neuroscientist Bruce
Pomeranz, of the University of Toronto, numerous studies over the
past 20 years have shown that inserting needles into acupoints
stimulates nerves in the underlying muscles.
</P>
<P>
   That stimulation, researchers believe, sends impulses up the
spinal cord to a relatively primitive part of the brain known as
the limbic system, as well as to the midbrain and the pituitary
gland.
</P>
<P>
   Somehow that signaling leads to the release of endorphins and
monoamines, chemicals that block pain signals in the spinal cord
and the brain. The result: A well-documented generalized
``acupuncture analgesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The endorphin story is really nailed down,'' Pomeranz says.
``It looks like it's nerves to the brain. The acupoints that have
been mapped over thousands of years are likely the spots where
nerves are concentrated.''
</P>
<P>
   But the endorphin story ``doesn't explain many of the other
claims of acupuncture,'' he continues. ``There have been a number
of clinical trials showing that acupuncture is extremely useful for
the nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy and early pregnancy.
That's not the endorphin system. Nobody knows how that works.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor does the endorphin story explain what Cho found when
exploring acupoints that are traditionally used to treat vision
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Designated by Cho as VA1, VA2, VA3 and VA8, they are not found
near the eyes but on the outside of the foot, running from the
little toe to the ankle. The ``VA'' in Cho's designation is for
``vision-related acupoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncturists say that these points are on the urinary bladder
meridian and refer to them as BL67, BL66, BL65 and BL60,
respectively. And they hold that stimulation of these points with
needles will affect the eyes via the system of meridians rather
than through the central nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   To test that premise, Cho strapped student volunteers into an
fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) machine.
</P>
<P>
   While standard MRI provides static cross-sectional pictures of
structures in the body, functional MRI goes further to reveal how
those structures are working. It measures minute changes in the
amount of oxygen carried in the blood, which is presumably a rough
measure of glucose uptake by various tissues and thus a good
indicator of which tissues are active. The results can be viewed as
colorful fMRI brain activation maps.
</P>
<P>
   Cho first stimulated the eyes of the volunteers by flashing a
light in front of them. The resulting images, as expected, showed a
concentration of color _ an increase in activity _ in the visual
cortex, the portion of the brain that is known to be involved in
eye function.
</P>
<P>
   Then Cho had an acupuncturist stimulate the acupoint VA1. In one
person after another, the very same region of the brain _ the
visual cortex _ lit up on the fMRI image.
</P>
<P>
   Cho noticed something else. When the activation data were
graphed to show the intensity of the response over time, he saw
that there were two distinct reactions among the dozen volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   During the acupuncture phase, some showed an increase in
activity, while others showed a decrease. In other words, in some
people, oxygen consumption in that brain region increased, while in
others, it decreased.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the acupuncturists mentioned, 'Oh, yes, it's yin and
yang,''' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   Cho asked him which subjects were yin and which were yang, and
without seeing the data, the practitioner correctly pointed out who
had shown an increase in activity (yang) and who had had a decrease
(yin) in 11 of 12 cases.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how to explain it,'' Cho says.
</P>
<P>
   -----
</P>
<P>
   Like many preliminary scientific reports, Cho's small study
raises more questions than it answers. Still, he has demonstrated
new functional effects of acupuncture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classically, acupuncture was the ultimate in experimentation;
people collected data for thousands of years,'' says Joie Jones,
professor of radiological sciences at the University of California
at Irvine and coauthor of the study. ``They noticed that when you
applied a needle in one position, it would have an effect in
another part of the body. But the connection through the brain was
never made. With these studies, we've demonstrated that for at
least some acupuncture points it goes through the brain.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet even if it does go through the brain, how does stimulating a
specific point on the foot trigger activity in the part of the
brain that controls vision?
</P>
<P>
   There is no explanation for that either, Cho says, although he
suspects that the path is along the nervous system.
</P>
<P>
   If that proves to be true, it's probably not the same pathway by
which acupuncture causes the release of endorphins, Pomeranz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That endorphins are released by stimulating certain types of
nerves in fibers anywhere in the body, that's understood. But that
there is a specific connection between your toe and your visual
system is really bizarre. That's really mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho hopes to push the scientific frontier a little further by
using fMRI and other imaging systems to explore connections between
acupoints and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to study how acupuncture might be used to increase
blood flow to the visual cortex in people who have suffered vision
impairment after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of studies by other researchers have, in fact, already
found that acupuncture treatments can help stroke patients improve
their range of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture imaging studies, Cho says, are ``opening a new door
for neuroscience.''

which acupuncture causes the release of endorphins, Pomeranz says.
</P>
<P>
   ``That endorphins are released by stimulating certain types of
nerves in fibers anywhere in the body, that's understood. But that
there is a specific connection between your toe and your visual
system is really bizarre. That's really mind-boggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Cho hopes to push the scientific frontier a little further by
using fMRI and other imaging systems to explore connections between
acupoints and the brain.
</P>
<P>
   He also plans to study how acupuncture might be used to increase
blood flow to the visual cortex in people who have suffered vision
impairment after a stroke.
</P>
<P>
   A handful of studies by other researchers have, in fact, already
found that acupuncture treatments can help stroke patients improve
their range of movement.
</P>
<P>
   Acupuncture imaging studies, Cho says, are ``opening a new door
for neuroscience.''

<P>
   For about two years the space probe Galileo has been gathering
ever more evidence that a large ocean lies hidden beneath the
frozen, fractured surface of Jupiter's moon Europa.
</P>
<P>
   Now the spacecraft has found the most convincing signs yet for a
Europan sea, in the form of salt deposits on the moon's icy
surface. The salts very likely come from a briny ocean many miles
below the ice.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence also suggests that Europa's ocean is highly
carbonated. Pressure from that seltzerlike sea may be responsible
for ejecting what appear to be sprays of debris visible on the
moon's face.
</P>
<P>
   The telltale signature of the salts was picked up by an
instrument on board Galileo called the Near Infrared Mapping
Spectrometer, which measures the absorption and reflection of
various wavelengths of sunlight by Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   Each material absorbs and reflects different, characteristic
wavelengths of light. The wavelengths measured by Galileo's
spectrometer _ from deep red in the visible spectrum out to longer
infrared wavelengths _ can thus reveal the chemical makeup of
Europa's surface.
</P>
<P>
   When the spectrometer focused on the areas of Europa that
appeared in photographs to consist of pure ice, it indeed measured
the characteristic spectrum of water ice _ no surprise there.
</P>
<P>
   But when the instrument examined features like the many dark
lines that crisscross the moon's surface, it obtained several
distorted spectra that each looked similar to ice.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas McCord, a geophysicist at the University of Hawaii who is
studying the Galileo data, recognized that the spectra were
produced by light reflecting off water-impregnated salty minerals,
including natron and Epsom salts. Such salts, McCord says, form
only in the presence of liquid water.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence that Europa's ocean is briny,''
McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   The circulating currents of a salty sea would explain the
unusual magnetic readings that other Galileo instruments have
recorded. Those currents may create a magnetic field for the moon.
</P>
<P>
   Galileo found that the salts have the same composition at
different sites scattered about the moon, evidence that the sea is
extensive and well mixed.
</P>
<P>
   The composition of the salts, McCord says, gives some hints
about the chemistry of Europa's ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The presence of sodium carbonates means that carbon dioxide is
probably dissolved in the water.
</P>
<P>
   On Earth, volcanoes and submarine hydrothermal vents release
carbon dioxide, ``so it is reasonable to think that carbon dioxide
gas would be coming out of Europa's mantle and into the ocean,''
McCord says. ``The ice cap would seal the ocean most of the time,
so the carbon dioxide would build up and become like seltzer
water.''
</P>
<P>
   Raise the pressure of that carbon dioxide high enough and it
could erupt through the ice to the surface. (This could explain the
origin of volcano-like features on Europa.)
</P>
<P>
   Once exposed to the near vacuum that exists at the moon's
surface, the briny water would quickly evaporate, leaving the salts
behind.
</P>
<P>
   As yet, there is no evidence that Europa has hydrothermal vents
on its ocean floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if there is an ocean, there has to be heat coming out of
the mantle,'' McCord says, ``so there almost have to be
hydrothermal vents.''
</P>
<P>
   There is certainly no reason that hydrothermal vents couldn't
exist in oceans on worlds other than our own. In fact, the Mars
Global Surveyor mission recently found signs of a large deposit of
hematite _ a mineral often formed by hydrothermal activity _ near
Mars' equator.
</P>
<P>
   If the hematite deposit does indeed mark the site of a large
ancient body of hot water, it would be an ideal place to search for
past life on Mars.
</P>
<P>
   A briny Europan sea might also contain evidence of past life.
But unlike Mars, Europa may still harbor some kind of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is felt that carbon dioxide in the ocean created a fertile
environment for the formation of life on Earth,'' McCord says.
</P>
<P>
   Carbonates create a less acidic environment, one more favorable
for life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we have, perhaps, a carbon dioxide-rich ocean. It's one
more thing that suggests that the ocean could be a habitat for
life.''

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New England Patriots have established the team as
one of the most tenacious gridiron players in cyberspace, and they
are positioning themselves to profit from you clicking on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating what observers say was the first Web
site for a professional sports team in 1995 _ patriots.com _ the
Patriots were the first to launch their own cybercast last year.
Now, in combination with two local firms, the team is building a
market for selling collectibles online; pictures, team symbols and
other products that avid fans will be able to pull down from the
Web and keep in their computer memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy was originally drawn from the fact that we wanted
to give our fans more information than they could get from the
mainstream media,'' said Patriots vice president Jonathan Kraft.
``But as we go on, we realize that there is more and more of a
marketing opportunity for the team here, and we have already built
up a substantial user base for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Patriots first produced the cybercast, Patriots
Live! This year, produced in conjunction with InterVU, a San Diego
company, the program is appearing four times, immediately after
each of the team's prime-time television broadcasts. The team also
now has a daily cybercast at 8 p.m., which is repeated through the
day, as well as Coach Pete Carroll's daily 10 a.m. news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the original Web site has grown dramatically, according
to the team. Last year, it had about 900,000 users. This year,
there were 2.4 million users by the month of August, said Fred
Kirsch, who handles the technology for the team.
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots are offering a new site that is only about two
weeks old. Developed with Tripod, a Lycos company, and Parable, a
Newton firm, patriots.tripod.com allows fans the opportunity to
pull down pictures and team marks. Fans can build their own home
pages and publish online to a community of other Patriots'
followers with only rudimentary knowledge of the online experience.
Hundreds of fans visited the site in its first week of operation,
Patriots and company officials say. The Patriots will eventually
offer the collectibles for sale from the site, broadening a market
that in the noncyber world is already worth hundreds of millions of
dollars annually in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   While many professional sports franchises, including the Red
Sox, offer a retail service for ordering the delivery of
collectibles on line, the Patriots site would ultimately provide
for virtual collectibles that fans can store in their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although NFL licensing officials impose tough restrictions on
the use of any of its symbols and marks, Parable's new ``Things''
technology makes the collectibles portable while securing the
licensing rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it portable, but at the same time protects it from
being modified,'' said Steve Barlow, cofounder of Parable. ``Their
content can be distributed online, but at the same time it's safe
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are encouraging people just to use it, just to
click on and get used to the technology,'' Kirsch said. ``The
technology will be there soon so we can limit the quantity of the
thing we want to distribute _ like linking a certain collectible to
a player's performance, for example. You know, it's really just
like card collecting, but it's on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   With sponsors like the New England Ford dealers and BayBank
running advertisements on the sites, insiders say the Patriots are
already realizing a revenue stream from their initiatives in
cyberspace that is well into six figures. Tripod and Parable share
in the advertising revenue while taking advantage of the
opportunity to market their wares.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Patriots move towards selling collectibles on the
web, they are bound to realize more revenue. Forecasters expect
sales over the Internet to grow markedly. The Yankee Group, a
Boston consulting firm, says the current world market is at about
$100 billion and could reach $630 billion in just five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will create a market that is two to three percent of gross
domestic product in a couple of years and I think it may be as high
as five percent by 2003,'' said Jim Cash, a professor of business
administration at the Harvard's Graduate School of Business
Administration. ``So, smart companies certainly need to be aware of
it. ``But I would caution that I haven't seen anything that
suggests to me that there is a great deal of overlap between the
avid sports fans and people who spend a lot of time on the Web,
although that may be increasing among younger fans,'' Cash said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft is more than happy with the team's performance online,
and he thinks it rebuts any skepticism.

PATRIOTS EXPAND PRESENCE IN CYBERSPACE

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The New England Patriots have established the team as
one of the most tenacious gridiron players in cyberspace, and they
are positioning themselves to profit from you clicking on.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to creating what observers say was the first Web
site for a professional sports team in 1995 _ patriots.com _ the
Patriots were the first to launch their own cybercast last year.
Now, in combination with two local firms, the team is building a
market for selling collectibles online; pictures, team symbols and
other products that avid fans will be able to pull down from the
Web and keep in their computer memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our strategy was originally drawn from the fact that we wanted
to give our fans more information than they could get from the
mainstream media,'' said Patriots vice president Jonathan Kraft.
``But as we go on, we realize that there is more and more of a
marketing opportunity for the team here, and we have already built
up a substantial user base for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Last season, the Patriots first produced the cybercast, Patriots
Live! This year, produced in conjunction with InterVU, a San Diego
company, the program is appearing four times, immediately after
each of the team's prime-time television broadcasts. The team also
now has a daily cybercast at 8 p.m., which is repeated through the
day, as well as Coach Pete Carroll's daily 10 a.m. news conference.
</P>
<P>
   Use of the original Web site has grown dramatically, according
to the team. Last year, it had about 900,000 users. This year,
there were 2.4 million users by the month of August, said Fred
Kirsch, who handles the technology for the team.
</P>
<P>
   And the Patriots are offering a new site that is only about two
weeks old. Developed with Tripod, a Lycos company, and Parable, a
Newton firm, patriots.tripod.com allows fans the opportunity to
pull down pictures and team marks. Fans can build their own home
pages and publish online to a community of other Patriots'
followers with only rudimentary knowledge of the online experience.
Hundreds of fans visited the site in its first week of operation,
Patriots and company officials say. The Patriots will eventually
offer the collectibles for sale from the site, broadening a market
that in the noncyber world is already worth hundreds of millions of
dollars annually in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   While many professional sports franchises, including the Red
Sox, offer a retail service for ordering the delivery of
collectibles on line, the Patriots site would ultimately provide
for virtual collectibles that fans can store in their computers.
</P>
<P>
   Although NFL licensing officials impose tough restrictions on
the use of any of its symbols and marks, Parable's new ``Things''
technology makes the collectibles portable while securing the
licensing rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes it portable, but at the same time protects it from
being modified,'' said Steve Barlow, cofounder of Parable. ``Their
content can be distributed online, but at the same time it's safe
for them.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we are encouraging people just to use it, just to
click on and get used to the technology,'' Kirsch said. ``The
technology will be there soon so we can limit the quantity of the
thing we want to distribute _ like linking a certain collectible to
a player's performance, for example. You know, it's really just
like card collecting, but it's on the Web.''
</P>
<P>
   With sponsors like the New England Ford dealers and BayBank
running advertisements on the sites, insiders say the Patriots are
already realizing a revenue stream from their initiatives in
cyberspace that is well into six figures. Tripod and Parable share
in the advertising revenue while taking advantage of the
opportunity to market their wares.
</P>
<P>
   And as the Patriots move towards selling collectibles on the
web, they are bound to realize more revenue. Forecasters expect
sales over the Internet to grow markedly. The Yankee Group, a
Boston consulting firm, says the current world market is at about
$100 billion and could reach $630 billion in just five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will create a market that is two to three percent of gross
domestic product in a couple of years and I think it may be as high
as five percent by 2003,'' said Jim Cash, a professor of business
administration at the Harvard's Graduate School of Business
Administration. ``So, smart companies certainly need to be aware of
it. ``But I would caution that I haven't seen anything that
suggests to me that there is a great deal of overlap between the
avid sports fans and people who spend a lot of time on the Web,
although that may be increasing among younger fans,'' Cash said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kraft is more than happy with the team's performance online,
and he thinks it rebuts any skepticism.

IS KEEPING RENTAL HOUSE A WISE FINANCIAL MOVE? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH HOOKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are on opposite sides of the fence on an
issue. One of us believes we should sell a rental house that is
next door to our residence. Since we're not stock-market savvy,
we'd find a good mutual fund and leave the money there. The other
believes the house isn't a bad investment, since we can control who
our neighbors are, and if we sold the house, we would have to put
our excess furniture, which is now stored in the attic of the
rental property, in a rental locker at an expense of about $50 a
month (leaving it there until we build our dream house). The house
would sell for just under $100,000. It provides $1,000 a month
income, with the tenants paying all utilities. The house is fully
paid for, and the annual cost of taxes and insurance is $2,000. Is
holding this house worth it, or should we sell it and put the money
in a good mutual fund?
</P>
<P>
   S.S., West Lafayette, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. This one would be a lot easier to answer if that hint of
building the ``dream house'' hadn't been tossed in. Let's start
with the easy part _ treating ownership of the house strictly as an
investment. Let's suppose the house is worth $99,000.
</P>
<P>
   Since it gives you an annual income stream of $10,000, after
deducting the expenses, ownership of the property is providing you
a return of just over 10 percent. That's just about what you might
expect as a long-term return from a stock mutual fund investment _
and I think it looks very good in terms of my near-term
expectations from the securities markets.
</P>
<P>
   Now let's consider where you might stand after a sale. If you
sold at $99,000, you would probably pay a real estate agent's fee,
which would reduce your net to $93,060. You would probably have
other closing costs, but we'll ignore them for the purposes of this
exercise.
</P>
<P>
   To get the same value from that $93,060 that you're getting from
owning the house _ including the $600 annual value of storing your
excess furniture in it _ you would have to find an investment that
would give you an 11.4 percent return. That's pretty unlikely, and
also bear in mind that this exercise doesn't include any possible
tax cost of selling the property.
</P>
<P>
   So if you combine that math with my low expectations for market
returns in the near term, it sounds to me as if the argument's all
in favor of hanging on to the house. The only argument for selling:
If you believe the local real estate market is now as strong as
it's likely to be during the next couple of years, and if you
expect to be selling it anyway within the next few years, using the
proceeds for building your dream house, you'd probably be better
off selling into a strong real estate market now, rather than
waiting for an uncertain future.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Q. My husband and I are 50 and 48, respectively, and we have
jobs that are not high paying. We have accumulated $10,000 that we
would like to invest for our retirement. We have been keeping it in
a CD paying 5 percent or so. I would like to know how a person can
become educated about investments. Do you begin with your bank's
resident broker and listen to his advice? Could you take a course
at a local college on the subject? Like most people in our income
level, I am very protective of this seemingly small amount of money
we have saved. I don't feel I could just jump into the market and
trust anyone. What do you think of Disney stock?
</P>
<P>
   D.M., Mount Bethel, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. I think a college course would be an excellent idea, for two
reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The obvious one is the knowledge and understanding of the
markets that you should be able to gain from it.
</P>
<P>
   And the second is that if you resolve to leave your money in a
CD or similar investment until you complete the course, you may
escape one of the most dangerous securities markets of many years.
Whatever else it is, this is no market for the learn-as-you-go
investor.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether it wouldn't be better, and easier, to simply stop
in at your bank, I'm against it.
</P>
<P>
   Banks sell mutual funds to make money. Although they may offer
funds with a variety of fee structures, almost inevitably there
will be a fee in there somewhere. If you were to take that
investment course, it would prepare you to make informed selections
among the many no-load funds that are available, thus saving you
sales charges that might be 3 percent to 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   I find that many people who have made inappropriate investments
or investments they do not understand have bought the funds through
a bank. I'm sure many banks have sophisticated and well-educated
officers serving their mutual fund sales; I am equally sure that at
other institutions, the mutual fund department is simply a drawer
in the desk of a harried young officer who has many other duties
and little investment training.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're going to pay a sales charge, pay it to an
investment professional who works with investments all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Since you're interested in investing, I'm sure that you've been
following the market headlines for the last couple of weeks, and
may be feeling even more hesitant than when you started. I don't
blame you if you are.
</P>
<P>
   I suggest that once you believe you're ready to begin
investments, you leave that $10,000 in CDs and embark on an
investment program only with additional savings _ putting aside a
little bit every week or month or quarter. This will serve to make
the course of your investment very gradual, and will mitigate the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   As for Disney stock, most investors, and especially beginning
investors, are likely to be better served with mutual funds than
one stock, or even a handful of them. As for Disney itself, while
it certainly deserves the right to retain the designation blue
chip, the years when it could do nothing wrong seem to be behind
it.
</P>
<P>
   Entering last week, the stock sold at 26 times earnings, and
near its 52-week low. Its dividend represented a meager 0.8 percent
yield. I'd wait for lower multiple and better dividend.

PROPONENTS SAY BARTER SYSTEM IS GOOD FOR LOCAL COMMERCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SELNA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BERKELEY, Calif. _ Instead of spending U.S. dollars, a growing
number of consumers here are using BREAD to buy goods and services.
</P>
<P>
   BREAD, the Berkeley Regional Exchange and Development, is an
alternative currency and barter system developed a little more than
a year ago by an ecologist who wanted a way to support local
merchants, increase human interaction and cut down on the waste
associated with the commercial economy.
</P>
<P>
   Since May 1997, the number of BREAD users has gone from 30 to
more than 300 and the alternative cash _ $10,000 of which is now in
circulation _ is increasingly being accepted by local businesses
and restaurants as part of a trend that appears to be on the rise
across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to build up the local economy instead of seeing
money going to multinational corporations who may be clear-cutting
forests or using sweatshop labor,'' said Miyoko Sakashita, 25, the
founder of BREAD. ``It allows us to see the special talents that
exist in our neighborhoods; people can participate in their hobbies
while they're paid to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   There are some 60 barter systems across the United States. While
each exchange program differs, all are based on the idea of
strengthening communities by reinvesting in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
   The BREAD system includes its own currency and a directory
listing goods and services of those who will accept BREAD currency.
The currency can be used to purchase goods, or it can add value to
a trade of services or merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   Each BREAD dollar is valued at one hour of $12-per-hour labor.
Individuals bartering for goods and services decide independently
how much they will pay and receive for their labor. Sakashita said
she valued the BREAD bills at $12 per hour in an effort to raise
the minimum wage to represent today's cost of living.
</P>
<P>
   Those using BREAD in the last year attest to its social and
economic benefits.
</P>
<P>
   BREAD user and Oakland resident Allysyn Kiplinger makes hemp oil
soap and runs her own medical-form printing business. Recently her
mother suffered a stroke and needed massage therapy as part of her
recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger looked in her BREAD directory and found a licensed
masseuse who accepted BREAD for half of the cost of his services.
Kiplinger used the BREAD she had earned selling soap at the
Berkeley Farmer's Market to dramatically lower the cost of her
mother's therapy.
</P>
<P>
   Kiplinger said the BREAD system is not only cheaper, it often
results in better quality work.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the network is powered by relationships, you want to
do your job and do it well; it motivates you,'' Kiplinger said.
</P>
<P>
   One shortcoming of the barter system, users say, is that it
takes a great deal of personal initiative.
</P>
<P>
   Sakashita said there had been no reports of shoddy work or
poor-quality products. But if there are repeated complaints about a
member's work, that person would be removed from the directory.
</P>
<P>
   The barter concept appears to be growing around the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1991, it looked like a movement was forming and now we know
of approximately 60 (local currencies) in the U.S.,'' said Susan
Whitt at the Schumacher Society in Massachusetts. The Society
publishes the Local Currency News and keeps track of such programs.
</P>
<P>
   Whitt said the most prolific local currency system are in
Ithaca, N.Y., where $65,000 ``Ithaca Dollars'' circulate.
</P>
<P>
   Local currencies are not a new idea, Whitt said, and became
popular with the widespread bank closures during the Depression.

JAY MCINERNEY CHARACTERS NEVER SEEM TO FIND THEIR DREAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GAIL CALDWELL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As almost any Jay McInerney protagonist will tell you, celebrity
is a cheap, fast-acting little poison. It can have you writhing on
the floor of your West Village co-op within weeks of exposure,
regretting the adrenaline thrills of the night before and the
superficial impulses that emerged. It can take what may have been a
mere overblown ego and turn it into cynical self-absorption. Worst
of all is what happens to the talent that elicited the attention.
Tainted by too many high-life Manhattan cliches _ too much White
Horse Tavern, provincial cool, and what Connor McKnight calls
``colonoscopic intricacy'' _ even the purest aesthetic promise can
turn to muck.
</P>
<P>
   A rich-and-famous profiler for the slick pages of CiaoBella!
magazine, McKnight has learned most of this at arm's length, but
his inventor might heed the same instruction. Like the vanity fare
produced monthly by McKnight's employer, McInerney's ``Model
Behavior'' (a short novel and seven stories) suffers from glossy
cleverness; the au courant indifference that seeps from its pages
feels more hollow than sad. All this is at the expense of
McInerney's genuine literary gifts, which have too often been
obscured by his hipster fiction rather than illuminated. An astute
social observer of the cruelties of modern New York, he is also
capable of great tenderness; his finest fiction (the ending of
``Bright Lights, Big City,'' say, or the novel ``Brightness
Falls'') possesses a melancholy depth that justifies and tethers
the witty self-regard. There are signs of these qualities within
``Model Behavior,'' but they're so surrounded by fast-lane
posturing that one's admiration quickly gives way to irritation.
``Model Behavior'' is a male version of ``Bridget Jones's Diary'':
sometimes funny and occasionally sad, and a whole lot less than the
reach of its creator.
</P>
<P>
   The title novel of the collection concerns the fading
relationship between McKnight and his supermodel girlfriend, a
tearful Viking named Philomena, who dresses in white T-shirts and
Versace blazers and seems to have flown the coop. Sick with regret
and desire, McKnight alternates between chasing down Philomena
(she's supposedly off on a shoot) and the latest target of his
interviewing skills (a boy-wonder film star who won't take his
calls). More engaging as a character is McKnight's brilliant,
screwed-up sister, Brooke, who's on extended leave from a
postdoctoral physics program because she's too depressed to leave
her apartment. As is so often the case in a McInerney plot, a few
family-of-origin beasts lurk behind much of the novel's surface
neurosis; here, they're personified by a set of perky,
alcohol-sated parents who turn a Thanksgiving dinner at the St.
Regis into a scene that would make even a turkey blanch.
</P>
<P>
   Roaming among McKnight's first-person and McInerney's third- and
(now infamous) second-person voices, ``Model Behavior'' does manage
to be swift and amusing; the tone of it is just right, capturing
the fey, privately intelligent voice of a freelance journalist who
fears he's slumming but fears worse the notion that he isn't.
Stunned with the usual mix of pathos and obsession that accompanies
a broken heart, Connor takes solace in a great deal of vodka, New
York's ubiquitous social distractions, and his best friend, Jeremy,
an exquisitely literary fiction writer who must endure the barbs of
cruel reviewers. With its self-consciously second-person guidance
(``You have suffered a chronic and massive failure of awareness''),
its parodies of literary culture (a critic disparagingly invokes
McInerney's name in a review of Jeremy's work), ``Model Behavior''
is what you might call meta-McInerney _ a long story whose chief
point of reference is itself.
</P>
<P>
   Spanning the decade-plus arc of McInerney's career, the seven
stories that follow mostly hover around the theme of purists
manque: the dehumanized, successful screenwriter of ``The
Business,'' the junior publishing exec of ``Smoke,'' the coked-out
actor of ``Getting in Touch with Lonnie,'' the would-be songwriter
who winds up on the streets in ``The Queen and I.'' These guys tend
to be English Lit majors who always meant to become somebody, then
looked up from the bottom of Hollywood or a nasty Dilaudid habit
and realized life was a bitch. The two exceptions are ``Con
Doctor'' and ``Reunion''; the first, about a physician who treats
maximum-security prisoners, feels like a young story, but it has an
Old Testament clarity I actually found bracing. Visiting at his
in-laws' home on the North Shore, the man in ``Reunion'' has a
fleeting chance to see the amalgam of character that makes us who
we are. But then maybe I was simply refreshed by these two day
trips beyond Houston Street or the Upper West Side _ or, more
fairly, beyond the inch-deep truisms of those places if you use
CiaoBella! as a Michelin Guide to life, even ironically. The
problem with ``Model Behavior'' isn't that it's set in
post-decadent New York, or that Connor and Philomena are the kind
of people you'd live in Queens to avoid. It's that Jay McInerney
here seems infatuated with his own stock weariness, and has
substituted mere artfulness for the tougher job of depth.

   NEW RELEASES:  &UR; ``Lady and the Tramp'' &LR;  _ The Hepburn-Tracy of
the animated canine world return in one of Disney's finest films.
The perfect fit of form and function (a cartoon romance) also
features Peggy Lee as the voice of a sultry canine. Who can resist
the most famous eating scene this side of ``Tom Jones''? One of the
few films that deserves to be called a masterpiece.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``City of Angels'' &LR;  _ The remake of Wim Wenders's edgy fantasy,
``Wings of Desire,'' doesn't fly. It's bigger and splashier than
its source material, and stars Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan, but it
remains earthbound. Cage's angelic observations fall flat.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; ``Suicide Kings''  &LR; _ Christopher Walken as a crime boss
kidnapped by preppies spends most of the mystery thriller bound to
a chair. And he gives one of his great performances with both hands
tied. Henry Thomas, whose post-``E.T.'' career is taking off, is
terrific as one of the preppy kidnappers, and Denis Leary, as
another hitman, gives an over-the-top _ in face, Walkenesque _
performance.

CHARLES A. LINDBERGH: THE ALL-AMERICAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID M. SHRIBMAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
LINDBERGH 
By A. Scott Berg. Putnam. 628 pp. Illustrated. $30. 
 
 
UNDER A WING 
By Reeve Lindbergh. Simon &AMP; Schuster. 223 pp. Illustrated. $23. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There never was a hero like Charles A. Lindbergh. So perfectly
cast as an adventurer, so handsomely formed as an icon, he was a
flier, an explorer, a crusader, a researcher, even a crank
political philosopher. But most of all he was a symbol _ of
American possibility, of American practicality, of American
celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   And so it is no coincidence that the great achievement of
Charles Lindbergh occurred on the horizon, where the American dream
has always been richest and most flamboyant. Lindbergh, of course,
in 1927 was the first man to fly from New York to Paris, a test of
human courage and mechanical endurance, a successful struggle
against fear and fatigue and even fog, that consumed 33 1/2 hours
but defined his life and, in a curious way, defined the American
century.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Lindbergh's is the ultimate American life, and A. Scott
Berg's new biography is the ultimate, and understated, exploration
of that life. Lindbergh may have heard more cheers than any other
American ever, more than Joe DiMaggio, even more, perhaps, than
Franklin Roosevelt, and he heard more jeers, too, suffering years
of ostracism for isolationist views that, it is often forgotten
today, were shared by more than a few in the country's upper
echelons in the 1930s and '40s.
</P>
<P>
   But through all those cheers and jeers, Berg is a competent,
comforting guide, never speaking above a whisper, and as a result,
in an astonishing biography of a man who personified the future
tense, no sentence is overwritten, no passage overwrought.
</P>
<P>
   It is impossible now, when the felicitous phrase ``frequent
flier'' is on every traveler's lips, to imagine the sheer
improbability of what Lindbergh did. But it is equally impossible
now, when aviation is no longer an adventure but a commonplace, to
escape the influence of Lindbergh, who was present at the creation
of the modern world and who played a central role in three of the
central events of the first half of the century _ his own flight to
Le Bourget, the kidnapping death of his son and the trial of Bruno
Hauptmann, and the debate leading to the nation's entry into World
War II.
</P>
<P>
   Berg's story is familiar, of course, but different, deeper, than
the story of myth and folklore. For years Berg mined the 2,000
boxes of the personal papers of Lindbergh and his wife, Anne Morrow
Lindbergh, and interviewed the five Lindbergh children. The result
is a volume that captures not only the heroism but the anguish of
Lindbergh _ the haunting loneliness of being what Berg called ``the
most celebrated living person ever to walk the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh's achievement was one of human courage, but it was the
meeting of man and technology that created Lindbergh's celebrity.
He experienced the freedom of the airplane, the imprisonment of the
still and motion-picture camera. ``No man before me had commanded
such freedom of movement over earth,'' he wrote once. The freedom
he had over land did not extend to freedom on land. Like Diana,
princess of Wales, he was hunted throughout his adult life.
</P>
<P>
   And while Lindbergh came to symbolize the restlessness of the
human spirit, he also suffered from that restlessness. He was
known, to be sure, for his feats of travel, but through a long life
what Lindbergh did mostly was travel. He was, not coincidentally,
always in flight, often traveling overseas as a good will
ambassador, often mapping out air routes, often indulging in his
far-flung interests, including medicine and conservation, but
always fleeing something _ the hordes who came to adore him and the
family that never quite did.
</P>
<P>
   So it is poignant that the Berg biography is being published in
the very same season as a very different book, ``Under a Wing,'' an
almost affectionate memoir by Reeve Lindbergh, the youngest of
Charles's children.
</P>
<P>
   Where Berg's volume is thick and imposing, Lindbergh's is slight
and inviting. Perhaps they should be read in tandem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not a typical 1950s suburban family,'' Reeve Lindbergh
writes, and it is probably the understatement of the year. Her
memoir speaks of family journeys to see natural phenomena (the
stars, a skunk near the woodpile) and of Saturday flights with
Lindbergh himself. In these pages are quiet glimpses of the hero at
home: ``He had both the easy confidence and the electrically
charged manner of a person who has often lived with emergency: on
the farm, in the air, and in time of war. He was calmest in
practical crisis, and grew more restless during quiet periods.''
</P>
<P>
   And while the presence of Lindbergh helped define the life of
the United States, his absences helped define the life of his
family. (He missed one son's high school graduation, another's
wedding. When his wife was bedridden for several weeks after knee
surgery, he was nowhere to be seen.) ``When our father left us to
travel around the world, and even when he left the world entirely,
at his death in 1974, there was an element of relief in his
absence, some quietness that we had never known in our lives
before. But he left behind a vast hole in our universe, as great as
the death of a star.''
</P>
<P>
   But Lindbergh was a star _ the first superstar of the century of
superstars. F. Scott Fitzgerald recognized that: ``A young
Minnesotan who seemed to have had nothing to do with his generation
did a heroic thing, and for a moment people set down their glasses
in country clubs and speakeasies and thought of their own best
dreams.''
</P>
<P>
   That was what Lindbergh was about: his dreams, other peoples'
dreams. More than 2,000 people sent poems to The New York Times in
the wake of his flight. George M. Cohan wrote a song, Kurt Weill
and Bertolt Brecht wrote a cantata. He earned a parade that was 22
miles long. He went on a victory tour that included 147 speeches
and 1,285 miles of parades. ``He served,'' Berg writes, ``as a
blank screen onto which each person projected his own best images
of man.''
</P>
<P>
   That was fine for a while. But the reverie didn't last, couldn't
last, forever. First he retreated, in part to preserve his sanity.
Then the ``Lindbergh kidnapping'' _ the shorthand phrase endures to
this day _ followed by an investigation and trial, both of which
Berg portrays masterfully. And finally the great debate about
America's role in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh picked the wrong side of that debate, and accepting
the Service Cross of the German Eagle didn't help matters at all.
He was altogether too soft on Hitler, altogether too skeptical of
the ability of the British and the Americans to take on the Europe
of the dictators, altogether too careless in his language. He made
himself vulnerable to charges that he was a Nazi sympathizer, or an
anti-Semite, or a defeatist, inviting commentators such as Ralph
Ingersoll, the publisher of PM, to describe him as ``the spokesman
of the fascist fifth column in America.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, Lindbergh never recovered from his romance with
isolationism. Indeed, it stalked him all his days, and unlike Alice
Roosevelt Longworth, Eddie Rickenbacker, and Kingman Brewster _ all
prominent in America First _ Lindbergh was permanently stained by
his views.
</P>
<P>
   Berg points out that Lindbergh ``was never associated with any
pro-Nazi or anti-Semitic organization; he never attended any Bund
meetings; and since more than four months before the outbreak of
war in Europe, he had neither conspired nor consulted with anyone
known to have any connections with the Third Reich.'' No matter.
The stain remained. Combat flights in the South Pacific wouldn't
completely wipe them away.
</P>
<P>
   Today Lindbergh is firmly a figure of the past; what is
astonishing now, at century's end, is that he has been a figure of
the past for four decades. His flight, after all, was seven decades
ago. The 1957 film ``The Spirit of St. Louis'' was a bomb, the
``most disastrous failure,'' Jack Warner said, that his studio ever
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``Much of the problem seemed to be that the phenomenon of
Lindbergh had subsided,'' Berg explains. ``Beside the many who had
grown indifferent or hostile toward him, baby boomers were more
interested in rocket ships and outer space than in some antique
plane.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But Berg knows that the Spirit of St. Louis will never
be just an antique plane, that Lindbergh will never be just a
celebrity with crackpot political views, that his achievement will
never be relegated to the dustbin of history. In his time,
Lindbergh's flight helped America see the future. In ours, it
explains America's past. That is legacy enough for one man and one
machine.

ORCHESTRATING FAMILY LIFE IN JAPAN

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MATSUMOTO, Japan _ Seiji Ozawa has long called Boston home, but
he admits his heart has been divided, sharing time across the
Pacific with his wife and their two children, who moved back to
Tokyo two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   His only regret about the last 25 years with the Boston Symphony
Orchestra, he says, is that he could not be with his children every
day to watch them grow. During an interview at the recent Saito
Kinen festival here, he says he and his wife, Vera, decided Seira
and Yukiyoshi should be raised in Japan ``so they could learn about
their roots, and after that, do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa describes the decision as grueling, one that was debated
over the kitchen table for half a year. He believes it was best for
his children, though it meant being separated from Vera and missing
many moments with his family.
</P>
<P>
   In Japan, such arrangements are not unusual; wives of men who
are posted overseas or outside Tokyo often remain behind to raise
the children. But for Ozawa, who grew up in a tightknit family, the
separation was very difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Today, his daughter, Seira, 26, a graduate of Tokyo's Sophia
University, is assisting stage director Colin Graham on the
upcoming world-premiere production of Andre Previn's opera ``A
Streetcar Named Desire'' in San Francisco. His son, Yukiyoshi, 24,
just graduated from Seijo University in Tokyo. An aspiring actor
and filmmaker, he recently appeared in a Japanese miniseries about
samurai.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the separation, by all accounts, the family is extremely
close. Ozawa calls daily, a habit that began when the family was
first separated and persists even though the children are adults.
Still, Ozawa regrets not having been there to share the children's
day-to-day experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's younger brother, Mikio, recalls a phone call years ago
when maestro Herbert von Karajan fell ill before a performance and
Ozawa was tapped suddenly to take his place. ``All the press was
calling me, so when Seiji called, I thought it was about that. But
he didn't even mention it,'' says Mikio Ozawa, 60, a radio
personality and music writer in Tokyo. Seira was going to be in an
elementary school recital, and Ozawa was distressed at missing it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He begged me to take a video recorder to his daughter's
school, because he wanted to see her so badly,'' Mikio remembers.
``She was just one kid in a huge class; I had to chase them all
around with the recorder to find her. But it meant so much to
Seiji.''
</P>
<P>
   Seiji Ozawa remembers the time when their home in Tokyo was
robbed while the family was out and he was in Boston. He told his
son to take care of his mother and sister, admonishing him: ``You
are the only man in that house.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My daughter said, `That's not fair. He's only 10 and robbers
are big men.' So we had a very heavy discussion about me not being
there for them. They understood that I had to stay with the BSO _ I
explained what I do. So they said, `OK, we have the solution: You
move back to Japan and bring the BSO with you.' Well, I laughed so
hard,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever I came back to Japan, almost every day I went to
their school. Some students thought I was a teacher,'' he says with
a laugh.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is pained to have missed special times, like school
field days or birthdays. Ozawa recounts being shocked when his
then-adolescent son casually mentioned that the family always
celebrated Seira's birthday together, because it falls during
winter break, but rarely his own, in early June.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked. I didn't think he cared about me being at his
birthday. But ever since then, I told my management not to schedule
me for June 6, and I've been with him for almost every one. The
funny thing is that now we give him a dinner and he comes for 10
minutes and then goes off with his friends,'' Ozawa says with a
chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Vera Ilyan Ozawa, a children's clothing designer, does not give
interviews, but her husband describes her as ``very Russian, very
strong.'' She was born of a Japanese mother and a Russian father,
and was a successful model when she met Ozawa. ``When she married
me, she really had enough of six hours' sleep, running around,
quick lunch. She didn't appear at events or even in photographs for
a long time. She just wanted to be a wife and mother.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's emotion about family is not surprising, given his
upbringing. He was born in 1935 in Manchuria, but his family was
forced to leave as World War II began. They had no TV or radio
growing up, so Ozawa and his three brothers _ Katsumi, Toshio, and
Mikio _ entertained the family by singing hymns.
</P>
<P>
   His mother, Sakura Ozawa, recalls that by age 7, it was clear
that Seiji had such an ear for music that Katsumi persuaded the
junior high school to let them use the piano a few times a week.
Soon, Katsumi so believed in Seiji's talent that he convinced their
parents that Seiji needed his own piano.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was right after the war; nobody had pianos in Tokyo,''
Mikio Ozawa recalls. ``But we had this distant relative in Yokohama
with an old piano who said, `Yes, we'll sell it to you for 50,000
yen,' ($385 at current exchange rates), which at that time was an
enormous amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   The family didn't have enough money to hire a truck to transport
the instrument, so the teenaged Katsumi and Toshio rigged up a hand
cart and hauled the piano 50 kilometers from Yokohama themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were really poor and had to pull together and cooperate or
we couldn't have survived,'' Mikio says. Those sacrifices built a
deep sense of loyalty and closeness among the brothers. (Katsumi
died in 1984). Today, Ozawa the conductor may be the busiest member
of the clan, but he calls frequently and is the one who organizes
family reunions.
</P>
<P>
   In February, even while he was frantically preparing music for
the Nagano Winter Olympics, Mikio says, ``Seiji called every
distant relative and got everyone together for our mother's 90th
birthday. He's the catalyst for family events, the glue holding us
together.''

DISCOGRAPHY REVEALS OZAWA'S HISTORY AND OURS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD DYER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seiji Ozawa made his first recording in 1962, when he led a disc
of African-American spirituals with the Tokyo Philharmonic Chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, Ozawa has recorded more than 286 works by 86
composers, ranging from little pieces by Ravel to massive
masterpieces by Messiaen, Mahler, and Schoenberg. Ozawa has led at
least 15 orchestras on recordings, including the four he has served
as music director (Toronto, San Francisco, and Saito Kinen, in
addition to Boston).
</P>
<P>
   Pride of place in Ozawa's discography goes to nearly 150 works
he has recorded over the span of a quarter-century with the Boston
Symphony Orchestra _ a few of them more than once. Ozawa's
recording debut with the BSO came in 1969, before he was appointed
music director. That RCA recording of Orff's ``Carmina Burana'' is
still available (the next recording, made a week later, of
Stravinsky's ``Petrouchka,'' is no longer around, though it has
accrued historical interest _ the pianist in the young Ozawa's
performance was the even younger Michael Tilson Thomas). The most
recent Ozawa/BSO recording, and the orchestra's first ``CD
single,'' was made ``live'' last season: Henri Dutilleux's ``The
shadows of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's discography reflects his history, interests, and
repertory _ and, like most discographies, it distorts his
accomplishment because it reflects the prejudices and priorities of
the recording industry as well as his own. In his entire career,
Ozwaa has recorded only two symphonies by Mozart, only three by
Beethoven, two by Dvorak, and none by Mendelssohn, Schumann,
Sibelius, or Shostakovich. On the other hand, if it's major cycles
you want, he's recorded the Mahler symphonies with the BSO, the
Prokofiev symphonies with the Berlin Philharmonic, the Brahms
symphonies with the Saito Kinen Orchestra. With the BSO he has
recorded many of the significant works of Bartok, Berlioz, Ravel,
Stravinsky, and Richard Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   Recordings of the works Ozawa premiered will prove to have the
most historic value in his discography. Of these, the most
important was Messiaen's opera ``St. Francois d'Assise,'' which he
recorded at the Paris Opera. Over the years he recorded 13 works by
his friend Toru Takemitsu, a few of them with the BSO. His BSO
recordings of new music include the violin concertos of Earl Kim
and Robert Starer, the First Symphony of John Harbison, Roger
Sessions's Pulitzer Prize-winning Concerto for Orchestra,
Panufnik's ``Sinfonia votiva,'' Olly Wilson's ``Sinfonia,'' Peter
Lieberson's Piano Concerto (with Peter Serkin), and the Dutilleux
work.
</P>
<P>
   The record industry's fondness for the vocal and instrumental
stars it has helped create has kept Ozawa and the BSO competitive
in the recording marketplace; many leading soloists request Ozawa
for their recordings. There are notable documentations of his
partnerships with Rudolf Serkin (the Beethoven Concerto cycle with
the BSO); Peter Serkin; Frederica von Stade (her 1979 Ravel
``Sheherazade'' was the BSO's first digital recording); Jessye
Norman; Itzhak Perlman (concerti by Berg, Stravinsky, Barber, and
others); Anne-Sophie Mutter; Gidon Kremer; Leon Fleisher; Yo-Yo Ma
(Strauss's ``Don Quixote''); and Krystian Zimerman (the major Liszt
works for piano and orchestra and the Rachmaninoff cycle that is
still in progress).
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa and the BSO have made a few disposable and forgettable
rec-ords, and some for purely commercial reasons (Ozawa has never
programmed Offenbach's ``Gaite parisienne'' or the ballet music
from Gounod's ``Faust'' for Symphony Hall, but he has recorded
them). He has not recorded all of his greatest achievements _ his
enchanting performance of Ravel's ``L'Enfant et les sortileges''
was scheduled for recording two years ago, but the sessions were
canceled for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   A number of the available CDs hold up against the competition,
chief among them Bartok's complete ballet ``The Miraculous
Mandarin'' (it was Ozawa's performance of this piece that cinched
the BSO music directorship for him). The Mahler box would probably
not be any listener's first choice for the complete cycle, but no
recorded cycle by any other conductor is wholly successful because
no conductor has been equally at home in all of the works. Ozawa is
at his best in the Second, the Third, the Eighth, and the Ninth,
and his versions of those works deserve an honorable position in
the catalog. Ozawa has always excelled in large-scale pieces, and
his recording of the Berlioz Requiem documents this aspect of his
work compellingly; one of his best recordings is of Schoenberg's
``Gurrelieder. '' At an opposite extreme, his subtle recording of
the Faure ``Requiem'' is very beautiful and in-drawing. The 1978
recording of Tchaikovsky's complete ``Swan Lake'' features
captivating solos by most of the legendary principals he inherited;
the 1990 recording of ``Nutcracker'' reveals the comparable
qualities of the orchestra he has created.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's career began in the LP era and has spanned both the CD
boom and the subsequent bust of the classical music recording
business. Some BSO players like to complain about the reduction in
recording activity and to blame it on Ozawa rather than on the fees
mandated by their own union. In fact, none of the other major
American orchestras has recorded a great deal more than the BSO in
the last 25 years, and Ozawa continues to record actively in Europe
and Japan, where it is less expensive.
</P>
<P>
   One result of the crisis in the record industry is that about
half the Ozawa/BSO discography has slipped out of print in this
country, which seems to be about par for the course (most of James
Levine's records with the Chicago Symphony, for example, which were
recorded at the same time as the early Ozawa/BSO discs, are also
long gone). Some of the deletions include ambitious and important
recordings, like Strauss's ``Elektra,'' and Berlioz's ``Romeo et
Juliette,'' which won a Grand Prix du Disque in 1977, and some are
surprising, like the comparatively recent 1993 recording of
Rachmaninoff's Third Piano Concerto with superstar Evgeny Kissin.
Even some of Ozawa's signature interpretations with the BSO are
currently unavailable _ Berlioz's ``Symphonie Fantastique,''
Ravel's complete ``Daphnis and Chloe'' (although the Second Suite
remains), and the major Stravinsky ballet scores (``Firebird,''
``Petrouchka,'' ``The Rite of Spring''), among others _ although
his Toronto recording of the Berlioz remains in print, and so does
his Chicago performance of ``The Rite of Spring.''
</P>
<P>
   Some other interesting and significant records are also gone,
like the 1992 disc of orchestral transcriptions of music by Bach;
one of this writer's favorites among Ozawa's recordings is a
deleted 1988 Faure disc that marked the recording debut of
mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt. Mstislav Rostropovich believes the
deleted 1985 version of the Dvorak Concerto he recorded with Ozawa
and the BSO for Erato is the best of his many recordings of that
work.
</P>
<P>
   The American market is not the world market, however, so it's
relatively easy to find imports of many ``unavailable'' Ozawa/BSO
recordings in the larger record stores. Ozawa's first recording as
music director, Berlioz's ``The Damnation of Faust,'' had a short
shelf life back in 1974, but you can find it in the bins today,
even though it's not listed in the catalog. Only five of the Mahler
symphonies are officially available, but copies of the imported box
of the complete cycle are around (selling for the fairly hefty
import price of about $250). Some early Ozawa/BSO recordings have
been reissued as bargain historical documents, like most of the
Ravel cycle he recorded in the mid-'70s, which now appears in a
twofer.
</P>
<P>
   WBGH producer Byron Bell has created a meticulous log of all the
BSO's recording sessions, and it includes some Ozawa/BSO recordings
that were never released _ Berlioz's ``Roman Carnival'' Overture;
Brahms's Second Symphony; Rossini's ``Semiramide'' Overture;
Vaughan Williams's ``The Lark Ascending''; Paganini's ``Moto
Perpetuo'' (a popular tour encore for the BSO strings); Chopin's
First Piano Concerto with Alexis Weissenberg; Poulenc's Harpsichord
Concerto with Trevor Pinnock; Messiaen's ``Oiseaux exotiques'' with
Mitsuko Uchida; and an important Jessye Norman record (Britten's
``Phaedra,'' Haydn's ``Scena di Berenice,'' and Berlioz's ``La Mort
de Cleopatre''). The diva has not approved this for release because
she is not happy with some of her own singing in one of the
selections. A rec-ord of music for children by Prokofiev,
Saint-Saens, and Britten was issued only in Japan, and Ozawa
delivered the narration of ``Peter and the Wolf'' himself.
</P>
<P>
   Ozawa's family physician, the late Dr. Shin-Ichiro Ebihara,
maintained a complete discography, which lists some vanished
recordings one would love to hear _ Beethoven's ``Emperor''
Concerto with the great German pianist Wilhelm Kempff and the
Toronto Symphony; Bartok's First and Third Piano Concertos with
Peter Serkin and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra _ along with some
that sound merely peculiar, like a Gershwin album he recorded with
pianist Alexis Weissenberg. Gershwin could hardly have imagined the
day when the Berlin Philharmonic would record ``An American in
Paris'' or ``Rhapsody in Blue'' with a Bulgarian-French pianist
under a Japanese conductor, but this is characteristic of our
modern musical world.
</P>
<P>
   The Ebihara discography is important for its listing of Ozawa's
early recordings in Japan (which include some advanced contemporary
music by Ligeti and Xenakis) and as a reminder of some of the most
important non-BSO discs, such as operatic recordings (Bizet's
``Carmen'' and Strauss's ``Salome,'' both with Jessye Norman),
Offenbach's ``The Tales of Hoffmann'' (with Placido Domingo and
Edita Gruberova), Stravinsky's ``Oedipus Rex'' and ``The Rake's
Progress'' with the Saito Kinen Festival, in addition to the
performances of ``Elektra'' and Tchaikovsky's ``Pique-Dame'' he
recorded with the BSO.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Ebihara's work also lists Ozawa's videotape/laserdisc
activity. Only a few BSO performances have been commercially
available in the visual media (Brahms's First Symphony and
Strauss's ``Also sprach Zarathustra'' on a laserdisc and a program
of Dvorak's greatest hits taped in Prague with Frederica von Stade,
Itzhak Perlman, and Yo-Yo Ma). With other ensembles Ozawa has
recorded videotapes or laserdisc performances of Honegger's
``Jeanne d'Arc au bucher'' and Stravinsky's ``Oedipus Rex'' (Saito
Kinen), Puccini's ``Tosca'' (with Kiri Te Kanawa at the Paris
Opera), Orff's ``Carmina Burana'' with the Berlin Philharmonic, as
well as orchestral works with Saito Kinen, the Berlin Philharmonic,
and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra.

<P>
   &UR; By CHERYL HECKLER-FELTZ &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Ross-Lee grew up in the projects of Detroit, put herself
through medical school and became the first black woman to head a
medical school in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Her story could serve as a blueprint for any woman trying to
balance family and career, or for anyone facing overwhelming
obstacles like poverty and isolation.
</P>
<P>
   But she is still strongly identified with her supremely
recognizable sister, pop diva Diana Ross.
</P>
<P>
   Ross-Lee, dean of the Ohio University College of Osteopathic
Medicine, has been featured in People Magazine and USA Today. Many
will tell you she is to the world of medicine today what her
younger sister was to the world of music 30 years ago -- a bona
fide shooting star.
</P>
<P>
   And if, after her years as physician, professor and dean, the
opening line is often, ``So YOU'RE Diana Ross's sister,'' as
children the opposite was true.
</P>
<P>
   Diana would start a new year at school and hear teachers croon,
``So YOU'RE Barbara's little sister!''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara was always seen as the brains of the family and Diana
the brawn.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1950s, when teenager Diana was an aspiring singer,
the family's Detroit apartment pounded with the music of future.
Motown stars Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson crowded
around the kitchen table experimenting with the R&AMP;B sound that was
to become a part of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Barbara knew them as friends but showed little
interest in their music, ``Books were my passion,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While Diana's singing career skyrocketed, and she claimed a
place in the history of American music, Barbara pioneered in other
ways. The first in her family to attend college, Barbara constantly
forged new paths, and today -- by her very position at Ohio
University -- claims an important place in African-America womens'
history.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 1, 1942, Barbara was the oldest of six children born
to Fred Ross, a factory worker and union steward, and his wife,
Ernestine, a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to both hard work and creative financial problem
solving, Barbara held many different jobs while growing up -- from
ticket sales clerk at the Old Graystone Ballroom in Detroit and
dance instructor to microbiologist at Sealtest Dairy (which
included literally gallons of free ice cream each week for her
relatives) and mistress of ceremonies for Diana's performances with
her pre-Supremes group the Primettes.
</P>
<P>
   She always was a standout science student with a strong interest
in medical school, but didn't pursue it right after graduating from
Wayne State University in Michigan in 1965. Instead, she earned a
masters in education and began teaching junior high science.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 a friend suggested that Barbara -- by then a divorcee
with two young children -- apply to Michigan State University
College of Osteopathic Medicine, a new medical school in Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, I am of an age in which women,
especially minority women, found it very difficult to be accepted
in medical schools,'' Ross-Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   She was accepted and began a grueling, highly structured,
never-a-moment-to-spare, three-year campaign to become a doctor of
osteopathic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   (Osteopathy emphasizes a hands-on approach in the belief that
the muscles and bones of the body play a significant role in many
diseases. In addition to conventional tests and drugs, the
osteopathic physician's manipulative therapy may be used to correct
a wide range of physical ailments, from migraines to back strains
to Parkinson's disease.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduation and residency, Ross-Lee returned to Detroit and
for 10 years maintained a family practice in a section of the inner
city marked by poverty and a high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have many problems with violence, but there
were some tense circumstances,'' she said. ``My patients were as
protective of my clinic as I was, and they helped look out for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One great frustration, however, were the number of people who
sought her out as a physician because of her famous sibling, a
concept she finds appalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never go to a doctor because she was Barbra
Streisand's sister,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Diana appeared in concert in the Detroit area,
patients, friends and even strangers would jam the phone lines to
Barbara's medical office trying to get tickets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most painful episodes for Barbara happened in a
hospital elevator when her mother was undergoing treatment for the
breast cancer that claimed her life in 1984. Diana was sobbing in
her sister's arms over the impending death of their mother when the
elevator operator touched her on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, aren't you Diana Ross? Could I have an autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Barbara began teaching family medicine at MSU-COM,
eventually becoming chairwoman of the Department of Family Medicine
and associate dean for health care policy.
</P>
<P>
   She has also completed a fellowship in nuclear medicine, is a
commissioned captain in the U.S. Naval Reserves and -- for good
measure -- was the first osteopathic physician to participate in
the prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellowship, where
she worked as a legislative assistant to former U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   As his legislative assistant for health policy, she was the lead
person representing him in the areas of women's issues, women and
children, immunizations, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse,
senior citizens and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   From her office in the rolling hills of Athens, Ohio, Ross-Lee
promotes an agenda to maintain excellence in education at her
school, to improve healthcare for isolated populations in her
region of the state and -- most ambitiously -- to strengthen
osteopathic medicine's role in the national conversation regarding
primary care physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that we could
easily serve as the model for primary-care education for the rest
of the country,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically called ``America's other doctors,'' osteopathic
physicians make up only about 5 percent of U.S. physicians (about
35,000 compared to more than 600,000 allopathic (conventional)
medical doctors).
</P>
<P>
   These doctors are considered the more hands-on cousins of M.D.s,
providing badly needed primary care family practices and
demonstrating dedication to preventive healthcare and service to
poorer populations.
</P>
<P>
   What they DON'T have is the clout, wealth and political power of
the American Medical Association. Ross-Lee -- with her own
history-making achievements and her sister's
internationally-recognized name -- may be uniquely positioned to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being dean of a medical school is of no consequence unless I
can make the way better for those who will follow ... those who
must follow me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was not always a medical school dean. Before this, I was
a medical educator. Before that, I was a family physician
practicing in the inner-city of Detroit. Before that, I was a
grade-school teacher in the inner-city of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``And before that, I was poor and living in the housing projects
of Detroit.''

   In the late 1950s, when teenager Diana was an aspiring singer,
the family's Detroit apartment pounded with the music of future.
Motown stars Stevie Wonder, Marvin Gaye and Smokey Robinson crowded
around the kitchen table experimenting with the R&AMP;B sound that was
to become a part of American culture.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Barbara knew them as friends but showed little
interest in their music, ``Books were my passion,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   While Diana's singing career skyrocketed, and she claimed a
place in the history of American music, Barbara pioneered in other
ways. The first in her family to attend college, Barbara constantly
forged new paths, and today -- by her very position at Ohio
University -- claims an important place in African-America womens'
history.
</P>
<P>
   Born June 1, 1942, Barbara was the oldest of six children born
to Fred Ross, a factory worker and union steward, and his wife,
Ernestine, a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   Accustomed to both hard work and creative financial problem
solving, Barbara held many different jobs while growing up -- from
ticket sales clerk at the Old Graystone Ballroom in Detroit and
dance instructor to microbiologist at Sealtest Dairy (which
included literally gallons of free ice cream each week for her
relatives) and mistress of ceremonies for Diana's performances with
her pre-Supremes group the Primettes.
</P>
<P>
   She always was a standout science student with a strong interest
in medical school, but didn't pursue it right after graduating from
Wayne State University in Michigan in 1965. Instead, she earned a
masters in education and began teaching junior high science.
</P>
<P>
   In 1970 a friend suggested that Barbara -- by then a divorcee
with two young children -- apply to Michigan State University
College of Osteopathic Medicine, a new medical school in Pontiac.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to understand, I am of an age in which women,
especially minority women, found it very difficult to be accepted
in medical schools,'' Ross-Lee said.
</P>
<P>
   She was accepted and began a grueling, highly structured,
never-a-moment-to-spare, three-year campaign to become a doctor of
osteopathic medicine.
</P>
<P>
   (Osteopathy emphasizes a hands-on approach in the belief that
the muscles and bones of the body play a significant role in many
diseases. In addition to conventional tests and drugs, the
osteopathic physician's manipulative therapy may be used to correct
a wide range of physical ailments, from migraines to back strains
to Parkinson's disease.)
</P>
<P>
   After graduation and residency, Ross-Lee returned to Detroit and
for 10 years maintained a family practice in a section of the inner
city marked by poverty and a high crime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really didn't have many problems with violence, but there
were some tense circumstances,'' she said. ``My patients were as
protective of my clinic as I was, and they helped look out for
it.''
</P>
<P>
   One great frustration, however, were the number of people who
sought her out as a physician because of her famous sibling, a
concept she finds appalling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never go to a doctor because she was Barbra
Streisand's sister,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Whenever Diana appeared in concert in the Detroit area,
patients, friends and even strangers would jam the phone lines to
Barbara's medical office trying to get tickets.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most painful episodes for Barbara happened in a
hospital elevator when her mother was undergoing treatment for the
breast cancer that claimed her life in 1984. Diana was sobbing in
her sister's arms over the impending death of their mother when the
elevator operator touched her on the shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me, aren't you Diana Ross? Could I have an autograph?''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 Barbara began teaching family medicine at MSU-COM,
eventually becoming chairwoman of the Department of Family Medicine
and associate dean for health care policy.
</P>
<P>
   She has also completed a fellowship in nuclear medicine, is a
commissioned captain in the U.S. Naval Reserves and -- for good
measure -- was the first osteopathic physician to participate in
the prestigious Robert Wood Johnson Health Policy Fellowship, where
she worked as a legislative assistant to former U.S. Sen. Bill
Bradley for 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   As his legislative assistant for health policy, she was the lead
person representing him in the areas of women's issues, women and
children, immunizations, tobacco, alcohol and substance abuse,
senior citizens and infant mortality.
</P>
<P>
   From her office in the rolling hills of Athens, Ohio, Ross-Lee
promotes an agenda to maintain excellence in education at her
school, to improve healthcare for isolated populations in her
region of the state and -- most ambitiously -- to strengthen
osteopathic medicine's role in the national conversation regarding
primary care physicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that we could
easily serve as the model for primary-care education for the rest
of the country,'' she says.
</P>
<P>
   Typically called ``America's other doctors,'' osteopathic
physicians make up only about 5 percent of U.S. physicians (about
35,000 compared to more than 600,000 allopathic (conventional)
medical doctors).
</P>
<P>
   These doctors are considered the more hands-on cousins of M.D.s,
providing badly needed primary care family practices and
demonstrating dedication to preventive healthcare and service to
poorer populations.
</P>
<P>
   What they DON'T have is the clout, wealth and political power of
the American Medical Association. Ross-Lee -- with her own
history-making achievements and her sister's
internationally-recognized name -- may be uniquely positioned to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being dean of a medical school is of no consequence unless I
can make the way better for those who will follow ... those who
must follow me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I was not always a medical school dean. Before this, I was
a medical educator. Before that, I was a family physician
practicing in the inner-city of Detroit. Before that, I was a
grade-school teacher in the inner-city of Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``And before that, I was poor and living in the housing projects
of Detroit.''

   CLINTON-VIDEOTAPE (Washington) _ President Clinton's videotapes
testimony to the grand jury provided ammunition to both sides of
the debate over whether he should be impeached. Clinton stubbornly
jousted with his interrogators, quibbling over definitions of
``sexual relations,'' attacking independent counsel Kennth Starr's

Feb. 28, 1997, encounter with Clinton because she gained weight.

 &HT;    On top of ol' Smokies
 &HT;    By Angel Bedinghauszent
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   FONTANA VILLAGE, N.C. _ It took a village to make our family's
summer vacation a fun one.
</P>
<P>
   The Historic Fontana Village, that is, a sprawling resort in
northwest North Carolina. The nearest town is a 22-mile, twisting,
rolling drive to the south. To the north looms the Great Smoky
Mountains National Park.
</P>
<P>
   The resort is far from the tourist crowds in Gatlinburg and
Cherokee, which is why we picked it as our springboard for three
days of exploring the Smokies this summer. But there was more to
Fontana Village _ it really was historic.
</P>
<P>
   The name Fontana derives from a 1700s French explorer, but the
village itself is tied to one of the greatest engineering feats in
this country's history _ the Fontana Dam.
</P>
<P>
   Within days of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin
Roosevelt gave the go ahead for making the atomic bomb, and gave
the Tennessee Valley Authority the job of providing power for it
and other war-time projects.
</P>
<P>
   For three years, thousands of workers converged on this remote
outpost. At the height of the project, 6,000 worked around the
clock. When completed in 1945, it was the largest dam east of the
Rockies. Standing 480 feet high, and three football fields wide at
its base, it holds back the 11,685 acre Fontana Lake.
</P>
<P>
   A spinoff of the project was a village, a couple miles from the
dam, and home to the workers and their families. Complete with
cabins, schools, church, a large hospital, recreation hall,
swimming pools and a ball field, the village was the TVA's way of
keeping workers happy so they would stay with the grueling project.
</P>
<P>
   When the dam was finished, the village was left high and dry.
(The dam is operated by just six employees today.) The TVA turned
to Government Services Inc. for help. They converted it into a
vacation resort. In its heyday in the early '70s, Fontana Village
called itself one of the square dance capitals of the world,
offering 10 festivals a year. In 1985, the property was purchased
by Peppertree Resorts and it still offers several dance festivals
in the fall and spring. It now includes 150 cabins, 94 hotel rooms
and tent camping.
</P>
<P>
   After checking in, we passed by a few well-kept cabins and went
through the village common area. This is where the action is: the
tennis courts, cafe, fishing pond, bike shop and rentals, indoor
and outdoor pools, recreation and game hall, general store, ball
field and a huge central lawn.
</P>
<P>
   A road that seemed nearly vertical to my South Floridian eyes
took us to our cabin. We gambled that the weather would be pleasant
(and it was) and reserved a cheaper cabin (in season $89) without
air conditioning, though it does have heat for the cool fall
nights. The cabin also came without phone or television, which was
fine with us.
</P>
<P>
   Our cabin was a duplex, weathered on the outside but recently
remodeled on the inside. It was built into the side of hill, and we
climbed a long wooden staircase to the front porch. A living/dining
room, kitchenette, two bedrooms and bath made up our simple
quarters.
</P>
<P>
   The cabin had none of the extra touches of a hotel. No tiny
bottles of shampoo, bath soap, or even dishwashing soap. Towels are
provided, along with pots, pans, dishes and utensils. Reading the
village newsletter, we learned there was no daily maid service. But
the cabin felt clean and fresh, and though we weren't in the middle
of the woods, the cabins are spread out among shady trees.
</P>
<P>
   The newsletter gave a daily schedule of guest activities, some
free. They included bingo, marshmallow roasts, crafts, guided
hikes, mountain bike clinics, softball games, a scavenger hunt, and
trips to white water rafting, the nearby Joyce Kilmer Memorial
Forest and the cabin used in the movie Nell, starring Jodie Foster.
</P>
<P>
   With all these options, it was easy to spend an entire vacation
in and around the village. We had taken two days driving from West
Palm Beach with our three kids ages 7 and under, and it was time to
stretch. We decided to explore the area on bikes, since the
resort's stables, swim club, marina and dam were just 3 miles or so
away.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long to realize a Florida mile on bikes is quite
different than a mountain mile! After huffing and puffing up hills
for about a half mile, we turned back for our car. During the next
few days, we discovered driving was the best way to explore this
hilly landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some other attractions we explored, and their distance
from Fontana Village:
</P>
<P>
   _ Fontana Dam, about 3 miles from the Village: Even if looking
at a slab of concrete holding back a bunch of water sounds like a
snoozer, you will be impressed. We drove to the base of the dam,
but its massiveness is more apparent from the top. A road, closed
to vehicles, lets you walk out over the dam and look 400 feet
straight down to the spillway.
</P>
<P>
   There is a visitors center manned by a few volunteers, some who
worked for the TVA when the dam was built. From the center, for a
couple of dollars, you can take an incline tram down into the
powerhouse. The exhibits there explain how the dam generates
electricity, plus you see the control room and the dam from the
bottom up.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cherokee, about 45 miles. The Cherokee Indians have a long
history in the Smoky Mountains. The ones who live on the Cherokee
Indian Reservation now are descendants of Cherokees who hid from
the Trail of Tears _ when American Indians were forced on a journey
to government-owned land in Oklahoma about 160 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The reservation is outside a main entrance to the Smokies. The
main road resembles in many ways a commercialized strip in any
Florida beach resort town. Instead of hocking seashells and
T-shirts, it's moccasins and T-shirts.
</P>
<P>
   We stopped at the Oconaluftee Indian Village, which has an
hourlong guided tour of old Cherokee housing and demonstrations of
traditional crafts.
</P>
<P>
   We learned about Cherokee society, customs and history. A
peaceful nation, the Cherokee never wore warrior headdresses, and
as a farming tribe, they never used tepees, but rather more
permanent dwellings made of mud, wood, and thatch.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a Museum of the Cherokee Indian and crafts at the
Qualla Co-op. Each night, there is an outdoor drama called Unto
These Hills about the Trail of Tears.
</P>
<P>
   _ Clingmans Dome, about 25 miles from Cherokee. (Closed Dec. 1-
April 1). This stop was one of the busiest during our trip. At
6,642 feet, Clingmans Dome is the highest elevation in the Smokies
and the third-highest summit east of the Mississippi. With
countless other visitors, we followed the wide, sloping walkway for
a half a mile. A steep circular ramp takes you up the final ascent
to the top of a concrete tower.
</P>
<P>
   On clear days, you can see beyond the Smokies. We picked one
when the sky was heavy with low clouds, so low (or we were so high)
that sometimes we were actually in them.
</P>
<P>
   _ Wayah Bald, about 50 miles. For the final leg of our drive to
Fontana Village, we decided to take the scenic U.S. 64 to Wayah
Bald, a 5,342-foot peak with a stone observation tower. The long,
winding road led to a turnoff, and then a steeper, dirt road that
climbed another 4 miles to a parking area. After a short hike to
the tower, the kids could see where all that steep climbing landed
us. They were awestruck by their first view from atop a mountain.
Below were the towns we just traveled through and beyond to
Tennessee, Georgia and South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   _ White-water rafting, about 35 miles. Several companies offer
guided and self-guided rafting trips down the Nantahala River in
six to eight-person rafts and inflatable kayaks. My husband and son
took a guided trip with the Nantahala Outdoor Center. The company
charges a few more dollars than others, but has a very good
reputation. For an additional fee, they also provide day care for
younger children.
</P>
<P>
   The novice father-son pair were part of a larger group of six
rafts and three guides. A bus took them 8 miles up river to launch.
From there, the current pushed them down river. Paddling was
reserved for maneuvering around rocks and rough waters. Though
there is a 60 pound weight minimum, the tour is perfect for first
time rafters and families. The dam-controlled river is predictable,
but with enough rocks and small drops to make it exciting. The
total time for the 8 mile long adventure is 3 1/2 hours.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cades Cove and Parson Branch Road, about 60 miles. Cades Cove
is an expansive, flat meadow within the national park. Around the
turn of the century, it was home to a small but thriving farming
community. An 11-mile, one-way road circles the meadow with
pulloffs at the remaining cabins, churches, a cemetery and fields,
which are still used to grow hay. Deer are often spotted and we
were treated to a doe and fawn ambling across a mown field.
</P>
<P>
   About halfway around the road is a visitor center and old farm
house. A mill, powered by an old wooden water wheel, still makes
corn meal. Check the Smokies Guide for ranger-led programs; several
were listed during our trip.
</P>
<P>
   After stopping at the visitor center, we turned off the cove
road for a short-cut back to Fontana Village on Parson Branch Road,
a one-way dirt passage. This ``unimproved'' road took us deep into
the Smokies, a side of the mountains we wouldn't have seen unless
we did some rugged hiking. We drove slowly for 8 miles alongside a
small creek. Heavy green foliage grew on either side with sunlight
barely filtering in.
</P>
<P>
   As we bumped farther along over rocks and through divots, the
creek grew wider and faster, snaking back and forth over the road.
Remembering the rain earlier in the day, we wondered how much
deeper it would get, but at the next crossing point, a short bridge
took us over the creek.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, the creek funneled through large steel tunnels into
the Little Tennessee River, and Parson Branch Road took us to the
highway that would lead us out of the Smokies and back on the road
again.
</P>
<P>
   FALL SOON TO COLOR SMOKIES
</P>
<P>
   Missing the colors of fall? Consider driving up to North
Carolina. The long, dry summer in the Southeast should create ideal
conditions for brilliant fall foliage.
</P>
<P>
   The leaves should start to change color in a couple of weeks and
last into November.
</P>
<P>
   North Carolina's scenic drives and historic bed-and-breakfasts
will fill with those who want to witness the most colorful season
of the year.
</P>
<P>
   By late September, cool air is expected to bring a bounty of
wildflowers, including asters and goldenrods.
</P>
<P>
   The varying elevations in the state, from the tops of the Great
Smoky Mountains to the flatlands along the coast, will mean many
peak weeks throughout the season.
</P>
<P>
   A foliage hot line will begin service late this month.
Meanwhile, call (800) VISIT-NC for information about fall events,
hotels and scenic drives.
</P>
<P>
   SMOKY FACTS
</P>
<P>
   How big: Great Smoky Mountains National Park covers 517,000
acres.
</P>
<P>
   Where it is: The park straddles 60 miles of the North
Carolina-Tennessee state line.
</P>
<P>
   Peak facts: Sixteen peaks inside the park rise above 6,000 feet,
making them the highest mountains east of the Rockies.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors: Ten million people visit the park each year. Summer
and the October fall color season are the busiest times in the
park. Holidays also are busy. The best times to visit include
September, mid-November and late March through May.
</P>
<P>
   Rainfall: The mountains receive about 80 inches of rain each
year _ almost as much as a tropical rain forest. This helps make it
one of the most biologically diverse regions in North America. The
forest contains more than 1,400 species of flowering plants.

   God bless the United States of America, and God bless
television.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:30 a.m. CST on one of the saddest and strangest
mornings in this country's history, I had a presidential
picture-in-picture thing happening on my TV. Not since O.J.'s white
Bronco chase and the NBA Finals in the summer of 1994 have we seen
such a bizarre juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   The main image Monday, courtesy of about a dozen different
channels: Bill Clinton on videotape, perspiring to a nervous sheen
and swigging from a can of Diet Coke, while answering questions
about Monica Lewinsky losing her temper upon learning the president
was alone in the Oval Office with Eleanor Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   The inset image, carried solely on C-SPAN2, the network of the
nerds: Clinton live at the United Nations, talking about the threat
of international terrorism, telling the assembled leaders, ``Each
time an innocent man or woman or child is killed, it makes the
future more hazardous for the rest of us ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the videotaped testimony took place very recently _
on Aug. 17 of this year _ Live Billy looked about three years older
than Videotaped Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's been a rough month for the president _ and for
the country.
</P>
<P>
   It would be stretching it to say the whole country was watching
Clinton's videotaped testimony Monday, but most of us did have
access to the one-camera spectacle, either through our TVs or via
surreptitious Internet webcasts on our computers at work.
</P>
<P>
   With the camera never swiveling to show us anything other than
the president as he played with his reading glasses, quaffed
copious amounts of soda and water, and used sweeping hand gestures
to make his points, it was almost like watching one of those
websites devoted to chronicling one person's life. Call it
www.prezcam.com or some such thing.
</P>
<P>
   What we saw was alternately riveting and revolting _ that is,
when it wasn't boring beyond belief.
</P>
<P>
   The questions about neckties and dresses and boxes of cherry
chocolates, the graphic discussions about the definition of sexual
contact, the sometimes testy exchanges between Clinton and various
henchmen for Starr _ these discussions were already bizarre and
chilling and ridiculous and unnecessary when we read about them.
</P>
<P>
   Watching the dialogue play out on TV didn't do much to enlighten
or inform _ nor was it even all that titillating, considering that
during various segments of the testimony, all you had to do was
click around the dial and you'd find, among other not-for-children
offerings:
</P>
<P>
   _ Sally Jesse Raphael doing a show called ``Gorgeous Women Who
Love Fat Men,'' featuring overweight gentlemen in bikini briefs
pawing at their relatively tiny significant others.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jenny Jones chipping in with, ``You Think You're So Hot, But a
Model You're Not,'' a show with bosomy, scantily clad, tattooed
women parading around while the audience rated their looks.
</P>
<P>
   _ And the great Jerry Springer weighing in with ``I Confess, I
Cheated!''
</P>
<P>
   You wonder how Tom Brokaw could keep a straight face while
telling viewers much of Clinton's testimony ``will be inappropriate
for younger children. You may want to decide whether or not they
should be in the room.''
</P>
<P>
   Or even in this country.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Clinton did look like a character in a ``Saturday
Night Live'' skit as he put on his reading glasses to deliver that
prepared statement about his ``inappropriate behavior'' with Ms.
Lewinsky. Perhaps a few unsupervised children across the country
found him on TV and thought, ``Oh goody, it's Story Hour with the
president!''
</P>
<P>
   Dirty talk notwithstanding, I'm not sure how many adults, let
alone children, stayed with the broadcast for the duration. Like
most courtroom testimony, Clinton's appearance was stultifying for
long stretches, as he rambled on and parsed away, often providing
much more information than was required by a specific question. I
would think millions of viewers gave up at some point, figuring
they could see all the highlights on the inevitable orgy of network
specials and expanded newscasts.
</P>
<P>
   For the record: There were no questions about Whitewater, no
questions about fundraising, no questions about the White House
travel office. It was all sex and gossip, all the time.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the day _ as the talking heads like to say _ did
this videotape change anyone's mind about whether Clinton should
resign or be impeached, or if we should move as quickly as possible
to close the door on this sordid and shameful witch-hunt?
</P>
<P>
   I doubt it. My hunch is that those who think Clinton is a lying
criminal who should get on the helicopter to Arkansas pronto will
still believe that, while those of us who believe Kenneth Starr's
investigation of Whitewater has mutated into an insane and ugly
monster will continue to wonder when the madness will end.

   God bless the United States of America, and God bless
television.
</P>
<P>
   At about 10:30 a.m. CST on one of the saddest and strangest
mornings in this country's history, I had a presidential
picture-in-picture thing happening on my TV. Not since O.J.'s white
Bronco chase and the NBA Finals in the summer of 1994 have we seen
such a bizarre juxtaposition.
</P>
<P>
   The main image Monday, courtesy of about a dozen different
channels: Bill Clinton on videotape, perspiring to a nervous sheen
and swigging from a can of Diet Coke, while answering questions
about Monica Lewinsky losing her temper upon learning the president
was alone in the Oval Office with Eleanor Mondale.
</P>
<P>
   The inset image, carried solely on C-SPAN2, the network of the
nerds: Clinton live at the United Nations, talking about the threat
of international terrorism, telling the assembled leaders, ``Each
time an innocent man or woman or child is killed, it makes the
future more hazardous for the rest of us ...''
</P>
<P>
   Even though the videotaped testimony took place very recently _
on Aug. 17 of this year _ Live Billy looked about three years older
than Videotaped Billy.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's been a rough month for the president _ and for
the country.
</P>
<P>
   It would be stretching it to say the whole country was watching
Clinton's videotaped testimony Monday, but most of us did have
access to the one-camera spectacle, either through our TVs or via

</P>

Congress react to Monday's release of evidence. (Carr, Cox News
Service).

federal workers and others sought a unique peek at a president at
bay. (Moscoso and Monroe, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-E-MAIL _ WASHINGTON _ The Starr evidence released Monday
made clear that e-mail, like the telephone, is not a medium for
those who wish their words to remain private. What ordinary people
should know about e-mail. (Regan, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   CLINTON-TV _ Analysis of TV coverage of Clinton video, including
whether CBS went with the full 4-hour version and comparisons

<P>
   NATIONAL
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-DROPOUTS _ In 1996-97 in Georgia, the Hispanic dropout
rate was 7.2 percent for students in grades 7-12, according to the
Council for School Performance, while the overall dropout rate in
Georgia was 5.2 percent. The Hispanic dropout rate was greater than
that of other ethnic groups in seven of the 10 school systems with
the most Hispanic students. A look at the problem and how the state
might try to address it with the Hispanic population expected to
double by 2025. (Kurylo, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)
</P>
<P>
   PROTESTOR-KILLED _ AUSTIN, Texas _ David Chain would spend his

working to get back there. Chain was killed recently, crushed by a
falling redwood as he and other protesters tried to dissuade

MOVED.

George, started a construction business in western Palm Beach
County, Fla. His pupil, David Combs, became one of the county's
largest marijuana dealers. He was recently shipped off to federal
prison. From 1995 to 1997, George and his company, Majestic Custom
Homes, helped Combs build and sell 38 houses on vacant lots around
Loxahatchee _ some of which, prosecutors say, were used by Combs to
conceal the money he made in the drug trade. (Hiaasen, Palm Beach
Post) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-SODOMY _ THORNDALE, Texas _ Prank? Hazing? Sodomy? At
least five people know what happened on an October morning last
year in the high school weight room when four freshmen football
players struggled with another kid. Whatever happened, allegations
flew that the football-crazy town of Thorndale, 30 miles southwest
of Austin, protected the ballplayers involved by covering up the
incident. The Milam County, Texas, prosecutor last month filed
juvenile charges in the case. And the town's angst began anew.
(McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman) MOVED.
</P>
<P>
   WITH
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS-TRIAL_ CAMERON, Texas _ Following the trial of four
Thorndale High School students accused of sexual assault against

   GEORGES _ Hurricane Georges barreled into the northeastern

and utility lines and forcing thousands to evacuate their homes.
More than 1,600 people sought shelter in schools and public
buildings in the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico, where the
full force of the storm was expected to strike later today.
(Emling, Atlanta Journal-Constitution) WITH GRAPHIC showing route
of Georges and Ivan.
</P>
<P>
   IMMIGRANT-PREDATORS _ RIVIERA BEACH, Fla. _ A Border Patrol
agent in Riviera Beach who came across Florida's sexual predator
list on the Internet last December prompted an offensive by the
agency to deport non-citizens convicted of sexual assault on
children. So far, 160 non-citizens have been kicked out of Florida,
including 58 from Palm Beach County. (Douthat, Palm Beach Post)
</P>
<P>
   TEX-ATTYGEN-ADS _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Democrat Jim Mattox hits the
airwaves with his first ad of his campaign for attorney general.
Will Mattox, known as the Junkyard Dog of Texas politics, use
disparing remarks in Republican John Cornyn's ad last week to go
negative, or will he take the high road? Democrat John Sharp also
unveils a new ad Monday. (McCarthy, Austin American-Statesman)
</P>
<P>
   DNA-CRIME _ AUSTIN, Texas _ Genetic analysis of DNA that put
Robert Alan Woods behind bars for a murder police say he committed
14 years ago and freed Ben Salazar from a 30-year-prison sentence
for a rape he did not do is too powerful a tool to go unquestioned,
critics say. Defense attorneys like Jeff Senter believe the people
who run crime labs are too certain of their methods and and provide
a look only at the probability, not the certainty, that a suspect's
DNA matches samples at a crime scene. Most scientists, however, say
the testing is a solid, proven and accurate way of linking suspects
to a crime. (Banta, Austin American-Statesman)

Habitat, a defunct housewares chain, and Next, a trendy clothing
store. Others made a splash initially but later struggled mightily,
most notably Laura Ashley and the Body Shop. The reasons are many,

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Fay Wilborn says she wasn't shocked or disgusted
with President Clinton when he admitted having an extramarital
affair with a former White House intern. She was disappointed at
him for being ``foolish.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was too smart to fall for all this,'' the retired
bookkeeper said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilborn, 92, reserves harsher words for others involved in the
nation's great political soap opera: independent counsel Kenneth
Starr (``a horrible man''), the Republicans (``they couldn't beat
him in an election, so they did the next best thing'') and Monica
Lewinsky (``I used to work in offices, and there's one just like
her in every office.'')
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton is going to battle House Republicans to serve out his
term, he's likely to need the support of people like Wilborn.
</P>
<P>
   Wilborn is among the Americans who have given anywhere from $1
to $10,000 this year to Clinton's legal defense fund.
</P>
<P>
   The fund has raised $2.2 million to help pay personal legal
bills for the president and first lady.
</P>
<P>
   The list of contributors was headed by Clinton's Hollywood
friends _ Steven Spielberg and his wife Kate Capshaw, Barbra
Streisand, Tom Hanks, David Geffen, Ron Howard and Jeffrey
Katzenberg, each of whom gave $10,000, the maximum allowable under
the fund's rules. But almost 10,000 other contributors gave smaller
amounts _ such as Wilborn, who gave $10.
</P>
<P>
   These and other contributors are Clinton loyalists who supported
him early in the 1992 campaign after the Gennifer Flowers affair
hit the news. They supported him after Paula Jones sued for sexual
harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the faithful opened their wallets again and gave to the
defense fund after the Lewinsky story broke and Clinton made his
finger-wagging denial of the affair. But their faith has been
tested in recent weeks, as Clinton admitted lying to the public,
and Starr revealed tawdry details of the affair and laid out
grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the beginning I tended to believe him,'' said Helen Howard,
a retired social worker in Mill Valley who gave $50 to the fund
after receiving a letter asking for contributions. But as the
evidence piled up, she began to have her doubts.
</P>
<P>
   ``As more and more stuff came out, especially when the Starr
report was published, it was clear he had acted inappropriately,''
Howard said. ``I'm disappointed. I think the man has been reckless.
He should have controlled himself a lot more.''
</P>
<P>
   But Howard, a lifelong Democrat, still believes the affair has
had little effect on the president's policies, which she supports.
And she sees a hidden agenda by Republicans pushing for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what they want is to get 30 more right-wing
representatives in the House,'' Howard said. ``I think that's what
this is all about.''
</P>
<P>
   The fund, called the Clinton Legal Expense Trust, was set up
when an earlier legal defense fund folded in January after raising
just $1.5 million in 3 years.
</P>
<P>
   Since February, the trust has sent out solicitation letters to
people who contributed to the Clinton-Gore presidential campaign
and to the Democratic National Committee. In an April letter,
former U.S. Sen. David Pryor of Arkansas urged supporters to ``join
other friends of the Clintons in contributing to the trust.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who have backed the president in his legal battles
are longtime Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are giving because they were Democrats when they were
born and probably will have a Democrat plaque on their caskets,''
said Bob Mulholland, a Democratic Party campaign strategist in
California.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But even Clinton's strongest admirers suggested his behavior
showed deeper flaws. Some said that the president seemed to suffer
from sexual addiction.
</P>
<P>
   June Lamb, a licensed family therapist from San Mateo who gave
$50 to the fund, said Clinton's sexual affair reflected unresolved
issues from his difficult childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very sympathetic to the hole he's dug himself into,'' Lamb
said. ``I feel he's really got a problem. It's kind of like a stage
of arrested development. From what little I know about his
background, it's very plausible that he hasn't had time to resolve
these issues. It's very sad that it's become rather serious at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   Lamb said Starr's report showed the prosecutor was ``in a state
of totally repressed sexuality ... this has just been an orgy for
him to get out some of his repression.''
</P>
<P>
   She suggested both might need counseling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need (Clinton's) leadership right now,'' Lamb said. ``He
needs to finish his term and then get therapy.''
</P>
<P>
   With his legal bills continuing to grow, Clinton is likely to
need his base of supporters. Anthony Essaye, executive director of
the trust in Washington, said the Clintons' legal bills had grown
from $4 million in February to more than $6.5 million as of August.
</P>
<P>
   Contributions have remained steady since the Starr report was
made public on Sept. 11, Essaye said, though it is too early to
tell whether the report would drive contributions up or down.

   SCI-SUPERSTRING (Undated) _ Special report. The theory of
superstrings, physics' leading candidate for the proverbial Theory
of Everything, has been described as a piece of 21st century
physics that fell into the 20th century and will take 22nd-century
mathematics to solve. This summer the quest took a giant step
forward with a breakthrough by an Argentine/Harvard theorist, Juan
Maldacena, that excited physicists to the point of dancing a
version of the Macarena (they called it the Maldacena). A special
report, by George Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SAFINA-SHARKS (Off Montauk Point, N.Y.) _ The sea here once
boiled with sharks. The fury provided a semi-factual basis for
``Jaws'' and a whole mythology about seamen and swimmers threatened
by fierce predators with razor-sharp teeth. But today, the sharks
are fewer in number and catching one of the killers can frustrate
even professionals like Dr. Carl Safina, a marine conservationist
who was prowling off Montauk Point here recently to tag the fish
that have become his obsession. To a striking degree, Safina, 43,
has succeeded at turning his ideas into action, at times global
action. Articulate and energetic, knowledgeable and willing to take
a stand, he is something of an eco-warrior ready to fight public
indifference and lax regulators. His role has won him many friends
and foes. By William J. Broad.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-ANCIENT-AMERICANS (Undated) _ About 12,000 years ago, people
living in what is now southern Peru camped on the Pacific shore and
feasted on fish, seabirds and shellfish. The remains of stone
tools, hearths and butchered bird bones found at two Peruvian sites
are the earliest known evidence of maritime-based cultures in the
New World, scientists reported last week. By John Noble Wilford.

</P>
<P>
   SCI-PREDICTIONS (Undated) _ Scientific sages depend not on tea
leaves or the positions of planets but on tools like mathematical
modeling, statistical analysis, complexity theory, celestial
mechanics, geology, economics and epidemiology. Needless to say,
scientists discount the naive paradigms of fortune tellers, ancient
and modern. Alas, rational approaches to prediction also fail all
too often, and it may be that there are some phenomena for which
predictions will remain forever out of reach. An essay by Malcolm
Browne. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ When shopping for a computer
system, the last features that buyers typically consider, if they
consider them at all, are the audio speakers. Most multimedia
computers are equipped with a pathetic pair of plastic-encased
speakers of a fidelity about equal to a clock radio, but now on the
market are systems that rival some of the best in home stereo
equipment. By Rob Fixmer. (1100 words)

<P>
   CAESAREAN-HEALTH (Undated) _ Although hard figures are hard to
come by, some doctors say that more women are asking for elective
C-sections, even when they are not necessary. And doctors are
sharply divided on how to respond. Driving this turnaround are
several recent reports that question the safety of vaginal
deliveries in certain circumstances. By Susan Gilbert. (1400 words)
</P>
<P>
   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Growing numbers of Americans are
stepping daily into a potential minefield of substances loosely
referred to as dietary supplements, many of which have little or
nothing to do with the components of foods people normally consume.
And increasingly these pill poppers are getting into trouble,
suffering toxic reactions to deliberate or accidental components of
these products or sacrificing the chance to be helped by
conventional medicine. By Jane E. Brody. (``l'' code)

<P>
   STROKE-POTASSIUM-HEALTH (Undated) _ A study that tracked nearly
44,000 men over eight years has found that those whose diets
included large amounts of potassium had one-third fewer strokes
than those who did not. The benefits appeared to be greatest for
men with high blood pressure. By John O'Neil. (400 words)

END OF COLD WAR MEANS BOOM FOR NATIONAL GUARD UNIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BOB GARDINIER  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLENVILLE, N.Y. _ The decision last week to base an elite new
anti-terrorist unit at the Stratton Air National Guard Base here is
only the latest example of how this once-sleepy airfield is now a
key part of the New York Guard's strategy to rebuild the
organization from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were on the slippery slope to extinction,'' said Brig. Gen.
William Martin, deputy adjutant general of the state Guard,
describing budget and personnel cuts in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But efforts in recent years to reform the Guard have started to
pay off. And Stratton is riding on the back of the organization's
efforts to turn itself around. Last week, officials announced that
one of 10 new anti-terrorist units, designed to respond to domestic
crises, will be based here.
</P>
<P>
   The anti-terrorist unit, which will add at least 22 full-time
military personnel to the post, is known as Rapid Assessment and
Initial Detection, Martin said. He added that Stratton was one of
10 bases nationwide designated by the Defense Department to receive
the units, which will respond to incidents of biological, chemical
or nuclear terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The location of the base made it a candidate for the unit, but
we also lobbied hard to get it,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Guard officials say New York's selection as one of the sites is
recognition that the New York Guard is no longer considered a
second-rate organization.
</P>
<P>
   Officials declined to identify the building where the
anti-terrorist unit will be located. The unit will be operational
by 2000, said Maj. Robert Bullock, base public information officer.
</P>
<P>
   But the base has seen other expansions in recent years. Massive
new steel hangars are rising and hundreds of jobs are flowing in.
The key to much of the growth is the ability of the Guard to
reshape itself in the post-Cold War era.
</P>
<P>
   For example, in recent years 140 soldiers were assigned to a
counter-drug operation based at Stratton. With a budget of about $6
million a year, the unit uses UH-60 Blackhawk helicopters and
fixed-wing aircraft equipped with night-vision and thermal-imaging
equipment to find marijuana fields. The unit also lends its
high-tech help to police agencies to detect the locations of people
in buildings during larger scale drug raids.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard, like other military forces, has been casting around
in the post-Cold War world for a new mission. And like active-duty
forces, the state Guard has seized on the role of combating drugs
and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   The Guard, which reports to the governor, is more suited to some
of these missions. Active-duty soldiers and Marines, for example,
cannot be easily deployed within U.S. borders. The Guard, on the
other hand, can be deployed by the governor and often is during
natural disasters.
</P>
<P>
   And Guard officials say their troops are more accustomed to
working with civilian organizations, such as police and fire
departments, than active-duty forces.
</P>
<P>
   Despite these trendy new missions, the mainstay of Stratton
continues to be Operation Deep Freeze, an operation to fly supplies
and people from around the world to science outposts in Antarctica.
The mission is expanding and will add 220 additional service
personnel this year, bringing the total to 1,262 active-duty and
part-time troops.
</P>
<P>
   The 109th Tactical Airlift Wing's payroll went from $19.6
million in 1994 to $32.3 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   The 109th started in the Cold War era by flying supplies to
Greenland, where radar units were set up to give the United States
warning of any Soviet bombers or missiles that may have been
launched.
</P>
<P>
   But the unit made a smooth shift after the end of the Cold War.
Now the 109th works for the National Science Foundation, which
oversees scientific missions to Greenland and Antarctica.
</P>
<P>
   The National Science Foundation, which funds these scientific
missions, is funneling millions of dollars into Stratton in support
of Operation Deep Freeze.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department also is spending money to rebuild
infrastructure. On a recent day the sparks fell from construction
crews welding together the skeleton for a new fuel supply hangar
while nearby crews worked on a four-engine LC-130 ski-equipped
cargo plane parked on the gleaming gray floor of another new
hangar.
</P>
<P>
   Besides the addition of troops, $32 million is earmarked for
hangar, communications center and dining hall improvements, as well
as remodeling and enlarging an operations facility that houses
offices and training facilities for flight crews.
</P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
   The New York Guard had declined steadily in the late 1980s and
early 1990s. The size of the Army National Guard had fallen to
11,625 troops in 1996 from its high in 1985 of 21,965.
</P>
<P>
   ``We realized no one knew or cared about the Guard, and our
self-image suffered because we were like a football team that
practiced but never played,'' Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1993 a state inspector issued a report saying the Guard was
run from 1983 to 1990 in a ``pervasively corrupt atmosphere.'' Two
Guard officials pleaded guilty to billing the federal government
for thousands of dollars in tuition costs.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators found some guard members secured unearned college
degrees in order to win promotions, and that cronyism and
favoritism had damaged careers. Soldiers were also used by the
brass for personal errands and home improvements and military
aircraft were used for non-military reasons, in one case to
transport Maine lobsters for a high-ranking official.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to sit and wait to be called. Now we act,'' Martin
said.
</P>
<P>
   And now top brass seek out new missions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more permanent nature of the Guard has been very good for
attracting these outside missions,'' said Brig. Gen. Archie
Berberian, chief of staff and assistant adjutant general of the
state Air National Guard. Officials said the Guard has also been
able to expand its missions because it can afford to be more
selective, choosing only quality recruits.

<P>
   A tiny, pilotless spy plane that can be fired from a cannon is
under development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. The
minuscule aircraft is designed to emerge from the case of an
artillery shell and fly over enemy territory, sending back both
video pictures of the target and its coordinates.
</P>
<P>
   Trials this summer showed that the plane, called the Wide Area
Surveillance Projectile, or WASP, is airworthy and could survive
being blasted out of a cannon, says John Deyst, professor of
aeronautics and astronautics at MIT and principal investigator on
the research project. So the team is continuing to work on it.
</P>
<P>
   The WASP is the latest twist in the development of expendable
drones that can fly over enemy territory. Some are already in use,
but they have to be launched from a runway some distance behind the
front line, taking up to an hour to reach their target. What's
unique about the WASP, Deyst says, is that it will _ hopefully _ be
cheap, have a fast response time and be controlled by a local
commander.
</P>
<P>
   The aircraft is meant to be packed into an artillery shell case
that has a diameter of 12.7 centimeters. Its wings, stabilization
fins and propeller fold back into its fuselage.
</P>
<P>
   The shell could be fired from an artillery piece or a naval gun.
When it is over its target _ which could be as far as 20 kilometers
away _ a parachute will emerge, yanking the craft out of the shell.
The spring-loaded wings then extend to a span of about a meter, at
which point a diesel engine switches on. The plane will hold enough
fuel for about half an hour's flying. It will send back video
images of the target, along with its coordinates, obtained from
Global Positioning System satellites.
</P>
<P>
   Deyst's team faced two major technical challenges: one was to
design a plane that could fold into a shell and still operate after
surviving the huge acceleration of being fired from a gun. The
other was to make the plane airworthy.
</P>
<P>
   The team tackled the two problems separately. An unpowered model
has now survived simulated firings. And a slightly larger model has
been tested for airworthiness. Deyst says the next challenge is to
build a single model that survives both tests. The main emphasis
now is on developing electronic components that are robust enough
to survive the firing forces, he says.
</P>
<P>
   Work on the WASP project has been carried out over the past two
years with funding from MIT and the Charles Stark Draper Laboratory
in Cambridge, Mass. Now, Deyst says, he is looking for more funding
from the U.S. Army, Navy or the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency to continue developing the drone.
</P>
<P>
   The MIT team is not alone thinking along these lines: Science
Applications International of San Diego, is working on a similar
project with the aim of carrying a bomb or other payload. Since the
aircraft are designed to be expendable, one key factor is keeping
the cost down to about $20,000, says Mark Roth, one of the
researchers. &QL;

   Two music copyright bodies have begun a pilot scheme to
determine how record companies can use the Internet for selling
music on line.
</P>
<P>
   Funded by the European Union, Britain's Mechanical Copyright
Protection Society and Performing Rights Society have created a Web
site containing copyrighted music to test the reactions of surfers.
At http://www.musictrial.com, tracks can be downloaded and copied
for free.
</P>
<P>
   The two bodies, jointly known as the Music Alliance, have chosen
the free audio-streaming package Liquid Audio for downloading and
playback. The company which developed the software, Liquid Audio of
Redwood City, Calif., claims that it incorporates secure
authorization and payment algorithms.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Numan's ``Cars'' is the first track available on the Web
site. The record companies will monitor feedback from visitors to
the site, says Mark Isherwood of the Music Alliance. &QL;

   A novel bedding material can starve dust mites, tiny creatures
that cause asthma, to death. Developed by the British textile
company Courtaulds, the new fabric contains substances that are
harmless to humans but lethal to the house dust mite,
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, which lives in bedding and whose
feces can trigger asthma.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the new material so unusual is that it attacks the
fungi on which the mites depend, not the mites themselves. The
usual way of controlling mites is to kill them with powerful
pesticides or to seal mattresses in plastic covers.
</P>
<P>
   Now David Service and his colleagues at Courtaulds have
discovered a new way to kill the mites, which they have developed
in conjunction with John Maunder and David Thompson of the
University of Cambridge and Trevor Cartlidge of Nottingham Trent
University.
</P>
<P>
   In their experiments on a simulated bed, strewn with fragments
of human skin and infested with the mites, the investigators
discovered that the creatures cannot survive without the help of a
fungus which they carry around on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, Aspergillus repens, predigests the flakes of human
skin into a form which the mites can eat. Without this
pretreatment, the skin is indigestible to the mites, the Cambridge
team discovered. ``It's like us trying to eat wood,'' says Service,
the head of the project and the research manager at Courtaulds.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reasoned that the mites would die out if the
fungus could be destroyed. So they spiked cotton and other bedding
fabrics with a fungicide lethal to A. repens. ``It's similar to the
one used in athlete's foot treatments,'' Service says.
</P>
<P>
   The fungicide is incorporated into the cores of bedding fibers
as they are spun, from where it migrates slowly to the fiber
surface. ``It's a slow-release mechanism, and can't be washed
out,'' Service says.
</P>
<P>
   The bedding materials, which include sheets, duvets, pillows,
mattresses and covers, are also impregnated with triclosan, a
compound that kills the bacteria which make underclothes and socks
smell. Courtaulds last year launched sports socks and underwear
incorporating the same anti-bacterial substance. Marketed by the
sportswear firms Reebok and Berghaus, the items are said to have
sold well.
</P>
<P>
   Courtaulds has already launched the bedding materials to combat
dust mites. It is selling them in Britain through the Textile World
chain and hopes to sign up other major retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The company is keeping the identity of the fungicide a secret,
and has waited for patent applications to be granted before
disclosing this new approach.
</P>
<P>
   Service says that the substances added to the sheets are
unlikely to trigger allergies. ``You can eat them,'' he says.
``You're more likely to develop an allergy to cotton.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's National Asthma Campaign, which estimates that 3.4
million Britons suffer from the disease, said it looked forward to
evaluating the new findings, but warned against overoptimism.
``It's good news if it works,'' says a spokeswoman, though she
warns that for maximum effect, curtains, toys and carpets would
need to be treated too. &QL;

   A novel bedding material can starve dust mites, tiny creatures
that cause asthma, to death. Developed by the British textile
company Courtaulds, the new fabric contains substances that are
harmless to humans but lethal to the house dust mite,
Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, which lives in bedding and whose
feces can trigger asthma.
</P>
<P>
   What makes the new material so unusual is that it attacks the
fungi on which the mites depend, not the mites themselves. The
usual way of controlling mites is to kill them with powerful
pesticides or to seal mattresses in plastic covers.
</P>
<P>
   Now David Service and his colleagues at Courtaulds have
discovered a new way to kill the mites, which they have developed
in conjunction with John Maunder and David Thompson of the
University of Cambridge and Trevor Cartlidge of Nottingham Trent
University.
</P>
<P>
   In their experiments on a simulated bed, strewn with fragments
of human skin and infested with the mites, the investigators
discovered that the creatures cannot survive without the help of a
fungus which they carry around on their bodies.
</P>
<P>
   The fungus, Aspergillus repens, predigests the flakes of human
skin into a form which the mites can eat. Without this
pretreatment, the skin is indigestible to the mites, the Cambridge
team discovered. ``It's like us trying to eat wood,'' says Service,
the head of the project and the research manager at Courtaulds.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers reasoned that the mites would die out if the
fungus could be destroyed. So they spiked cotton and other bedding
fabrics with a fungicide lethal to A. repens. ``It's similar to the
one used in athlete's foot treatments,'' Service says.
</P>
<P>
   The fungicide is incorporated into the cores of bedding fibers
as they are spun, from where it migrates slowly to the fiber
surface. ``It's a slow-release mechanism, and can't be washed
out,'' Service says.
</P>
<P>
   The bedding materials, which include sheets, duvets, pillows,
mattresses and covers, are also impregnated with triclosan, a
compound that kills the bacteria which make underclothes and socks
smell. Courtaulds last year launched sports socks and underwear
incorporating the same anti-bacterial substance. Marketed by the
sportswear firms Reebok and Berghaus, the items are said to have
sold well.
</P>
<P>
   Courtaulds has already launched the bedding materials to combat
dust mites. It is selling them in Britain through the Textile World
chain and hopes to sign up other major retailers.
</P>
<P>
   The company is keeping the identity of the fungicide a secret,
and has waited for patent applications to be granted before
disclosing this new approach.
</P>
<P>
   Service says that the substances added to the sheets are
unlikely to trigger allergies. ``You can eat them,'' he says.
``You're more likely to develop an allergy to cotton.''
</P>
<P>
   Britain's National Asthma Campaign, which estimates that 3.4
million Britons suffer from the disease, said it looked forward to
evaluating the new findings, but warned against overoptimism.
``It's good news if it works,'' says a spokeswoman, though she
warns that for maximum effect, curtains, toys and carpets would
need to be treated too. &QL;

PENTAGON UPDATES TRAINING MANUAL TO INCLUDE URANIUM DANGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KATHLEEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ARLINGTON, Va. _ In a move applauded by Gulf War veterans, the
Defense Department has announced plans to add information about the
hazards of depleted uranium explosions to the manual issued to all
soldiers during basic training.
</P>
<P>
   The book, formally known as the Common Tasks Training or CTT
manual, lists about 40 duties soldiers must master _ how to dig a
foxhole, read a compass, administer first aid, and survive in hot
and cold weather.
</P>
<P>
   When the revised manual is issued later this year, it also will
tell soldiers how to protect themselves from the hazards linked to
depleted uranium ammunition, which is made of a heavy metal that is
radioactive, said Lt. Col. Charles Kelsey, who serves on the
faculty of the Pentagon's medical school in Bethesda, Md.
</P>
<P>
   During an interview Saturday at the third annual Gulf War
Veterans' Illnesses Conference, Kelsey said the new manual will
address the hazards of depleted uranium and other radioactive
substances.
</P>
<P>
   Kelsey said the hazards posed by depleted uranium were ``pretty
minor'' compared with other battlefield dangers.
</P>
<P>
   The depleted-uranium ammunition, which was fired by U.S. tanks
and aircraft, was used for the first time in combat in the Gulf. It
ignites on impact and blasts holes through tanks. Many nations have
since added it to their arsenals.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Sullivan, executive director of the national Gulf War
Resource Center, which sponsored the conference, hailed the
Pentagon's move to update the manual.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the group, a coalition of veterans-rights
organizations across the country has been pressuring the Pentagon
to train soldiers about the hazards of depleted uranium exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Gulf War Resource Center also advocates medical care and
compensation for Gulf War veterans and their families.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon has admitted that soldiers sent to the Gulf were
not told that inhaling, ingesting or absorbing the hazardous
residue created by a depleted uranium explosion could cause cancer,
or respiratory, kidney and skin disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to learn from the mistakes of the past,'' Sullivan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, many veterans are fighting for medical care and
compensation for ailments they believe are linked to depleted
uranium exposure.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon said in January that thousands of soldiers may have
been exposed to depleted uranium. Veterans groups have said they
believe as many as 400,000 soldiers may have been exposed.
</P>
<P>
   The explosions, the Pentagon said, created an estimated 630,000
pounds of depleted uranium dust and debris. Anthony Hardie, a
30-year-old Gulf War veteran attending the conference, said
depleted uranium was one of many toxic substances soldiers were
exposed to in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to us should never again happen,'' he said.
``It's important that we protect our current force in the Gulf and
in the service.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardie, who served in the Gulf and in Somalia, is president of
the Gulf War Veterans of Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   Hardie said he became an advocate for Gulf War veterans out of
necessity when he could not get medical care at a Veterans
Administration Hospital for illnesses he said are linked to his
tour of duty in the Gulf.

<TEXT>
<P>
   If you caught your husband in bed with another woman or learned
about a one-night stand, you wouldn't be the first to find your
mate was a cheat.
</P>
<P>
   Or the first who chose to forgive him.
</P>
<P>
   Laura R. Meers, a psychologist in Columbus, Ohio, has observed
during 20 years of practice a change in attitude. ``I used to see
when an affair lead to an immediate divorce,'' she said. ``Now men
and women have become more tolerant. In some ways that is not all
bad.''
</P>
<P>
   Meers does not advocate infidelity. However, she thinks the
discovery of infidelity leads directly to issues that drew the
couple apart, and if resolved can lead them back together again.
</P>
<P>
   Of course not every wife is willing to forgive and move on,
especially if the lies and cover-up are too damaging, Dory
Hollander, author of ``101 Lies Men Tell Women'' (Harper Perennial,
1997) said in a telephone interview from St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Meers says half the women in her practice who have been
confronted with an unfaithful spouse choose to separate. Bonnie
Eaker Weil, author of ``Adultery, The Forgivable Sin'' (Hastings
House, 1994) estimates that about one-third of the couples touched
by infidelity manage to work it out.
</P>
<P>
   Encounters that are strictly sexual are the least hurtful to
wives and less damaging to a marriage. ``If it is only a sexual
affair, a woman can convince herself that her husband is not
rejecting her as a life partner and still values their
partnership,'' Elayne Savage, author of ``Don't Take It Personally
(New Harbinger, 1997), said in a telephone interview from Berkeley,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   How well the indiscretion is kept under wraps may determine a
woman's ultimate decision. ``The public humiliation of an affair is
generally what most people find intolerable,'' said William
Friedman, a family-law attorney in Columbus. ``I don't see many
people who could appear in public like Hillary Clinton.''
</P>
<P>
   Weil said it is old-fashioned love that keeps women like Clinton
and Kathie Lee Gifford in their marriages despite the public
exposure of their spouses' affairs. ``Love is a bond or psychic
connection,'' Weil said. ``It is a journey through good territory
and bad in which two people are able to connect, disconnect and
more importantly reconnect.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert W. Birch, a psychologist in Columbus, has found that
optimism about a marriage is justified so long he sees evidence of
at least one of four key ingredients: love, trust, mutual respect
and passion.
</P>
<P>
   For Meers, the crucial factor is the self-esteem that women
manage to retain in the face of infidelity. She said the women who
keep their marriages intact generally perceive themselves as having
some power over decision making. Despite their initial reaction to
want to scream or punch their spouse, once they distance themselves
from the pain and regroup they can look at the situation more
objectively.
</P>
<P>
   Another factor is willingness to take some responsibility for
past failures in the marriage, experts agree. ``The woman who is
able to admit, 'Maybe I wasn't fulfilling enough of his needs,' is
more likely to reconcile than the grudge-holder who reacts out of
pain and anger,'' Weil said.
</P>
<P>
   But if a husband persists in blaming his wife for his
philandering, if he refuses to voice repentance and if he fails to
admit responsibility for a making a bad choice, it is less likely
that a woman will be able to take the last essential step of
forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
   The wife who continues to stand by her man lovingly is a woman
who can forgive him, Meers says. Forgiveness _ the willingness to
let go of any discussion or acknowledgment that the actual affair
took place _ is a tall but necessary order to rebuild the trust
that is essential to continuing in a relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forgive? Absolutely,'' Meers advised.
</P>
<P>
   Forget? Absolutely not.

<P>
   Anyone who has grown hybrid tea roses will know that the
beautiful blooms take a lot of work.
</P>
<P>
   Abundant sun, rich soil with good drainage, regular fertilizing,
careful pruning all through the growing season, and spraying for
pests and diseases may all required to keep the plant in fine
shape.
</P>
<P>
   Rose lovers jumped for joy when a new breed of roses,
collectively called landscape roses, appeared early in the 1990s.
These roses combined durability, bushy growth, and fragrance of
old-fashioned roses with the repeat bloom of modern hybrids. They
were touted as being beautiful without bother.
</P>
<P>
   Two groups of landscape roses have spread across the the United
States. The most widely publicized are English Roses produced by
David Austin, an English breeder. They are romantic, full flowers
available in rich reds and purples or a range of yellows, pinks and
pastels.
</P>
<P>
   More down-to-earth, super hardy roses in the Explorer and
Parkland series have come from Agriculture Canada breeding
programs. Durable parents such as rugosa roses and the native
prairie rose (Rosa arkansana) give the hybrids attractive, bushy
forms and easy-care qualities.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Hawke, Chicago Botanic Garden coordinator of plant
evaluation programs, found Agriculture Canada roses to have their
own unique look quite different from Austin English Roses.
</P>
<P>
   Glowing claims surrounding landscape roses have lifted a few
eyebrows. Are Austin roses truly be hardy enough to handle northern
winters? While the Agriculture Canada roses were unquestionably
hardy, were they actually disease resistant?
</P>
<P>
   The Chicago Botanic Garden knucked down to find some answers,
testing an assortment of roses under primitive conditions _ similar
to what they might experience in low-maintenace home landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The results of the seven-year study were released in January in
Chicago Botanic Garden's Plant Evaluation Notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We planted in soil that was adequate, but not great as none of
our soil here is outstanding. Then we didn't do anything to the
plants except pruning out dead wood at the end of winter and
picking up fallen diseased leaves,'' explained Hawke.
</P>
<P>
   ``We found a few roses that you could put out in the landscape
and let go, like a rugosa rose,'' Hawke said. ``But most would be
much better suited if given some winter protection, renewal
pruning, fertilization, and protection from black spot disease.
With that kind of care, there are many good possiblilties here.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Austin Rose Results: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Of over 90 Austin varieties now available, the Botanic Garden
has tested 31, which were planted in 1990. Hawke was delighted in
the flower quality, reporting, ``The colors and forms of these
blossoms were exquisite gems during the summer months.''
</P>
<P>
   But without regular pruning and shaping, cultivars such as
`Belle Story', `Cymbeline', `Fair Bianca', `Francine Austin',
`Gertrude Jekyll', `Othello', `Perdita', `The Countryman',
`Troilus', `Wise Portia', and `Yellow Button' grew either stubby or
gangly in shape.
</P>
<P>
   Those displaying naturally full, robust, and attractive forms
included `Constance Spry', `Graham Thomas', `Heritage', `Lucetta',
`Mary Rose', and `The Reeve'.
</P>
<P>
   Without a fungicide spray program, all the Austin roses suffered
from black spot to some degree. There was some resistance shown by
`Cymbeline', `Lucetta', and `The Reeve'.
</P>
<P>
   There were no total losses from winter kill during the time of
the trial, proving English roses are indeed hardy. During severe
winters, the plants died back to the ground but reemerged from
roots in spring similar to a hybrid tea rose.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, three English roses rated a hearty recommendation:
`Constance Spry', with large, soft-pink, double flowers; `Lucetta',
with large, blush-pink, semidouble flowers; and `The Reeve', with
dark pink, moderately large, double flowers.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Agriculture Canada Results: &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nineteen varieties of Agriculture Canada roses were planted in
1992. They differed from the English roses in producing hips,
bright orange or red fruit that looked attractive deep into winter.
Hybrids derived from rugosa roses such as `David Thompson', `Henry
Hudson', `Jens Munk', and `Martin Frobisher' were highly resistant
to black spot.
</P>
<P>
   With long and lovely stems full of flower, climbing roses such
as `Henry Kelsey', with medium sized red flowers, `John Davis',
with moderately large, pink flowers, and `William Baffin', with
medium sized, dark pink flowers, were among the best roses in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
   Other top contenders included `Assiniboine', with moderately
large, purple-red flowers, `Champlain', with moderately large, dark
red flowers, and `Jens Munk' with medium sized pink flowers.

WHAT KIND OF A GRANDPARENT ARE YOU?
</HEADLINE>
  By RUTH K. WESTHEIMER AND STEVEN KAPLAN 
 c.1998 Ruth K. Westheimer and Steven Kaplan 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Of all the roles in the nuclear and extended family, none is as
loosely defined as that of the grandparent.
</P>
<P>
   No single dominant model exists of what a grandparent is
supposed to do and how a grandparent is supposed to act. Many
grandparents, especially first-timers, are often left unsure of
what is expected of them and how best to fill their role.
</P>
<P>
   In choosing a grandparenting style, it is probably most
important to ask yourself some key questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ What kinds of things do I enjoy doing?
</P>
<P>
   _ What special skills do I have? How much time do I have
available and how much do I want to spend grandparenting?
</P>
<P>
   _ What are my children's and grandchildren's needs?
</P>
<P>
   _ What religious and ethnic traditions do I want to pass on to
my grandchildren?
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Some Basic Styles &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, scholars have made numerous attempts to classify
the different types of grandparents. There is no widespread
agreement on the best way to make the division. One attempt that
I've found very interesting was proposed by Berniece Neugarten and
Karol Weinstein in their now-classic 1964 article, ``The Changing
American Grandparent.'' Based on interviews with grandparents, they
were able to identify five basic styles:
</P>
<P>
   _Fun-seeking
</P>
<P>
   _ Formal
</P>
<P>
   _ Distant
</P>
<P>
   _ Reservoirs of family wisdom
</P>
<P>
   _ Surrogate parents
</P>
<P>
   Many grandparents combine elements of each of these types, and
some more recent studies have tried to reflect this complexity. You
may find that your grandparenting style changes over time as your
circumstances change and your grandchildren grow. So take the
models that follow as general guides, not as goals to be achieved.
</P>
<P>
   The fun-seeking (or what some have called companionate)
grandparent's relationship to his grandchildren is marked
especially by informality and playfulness. He joins the child in
specific activities with the express purpose of having fun, almost
as if he were a playmate. The emphasis here is on mutual
satisfaction rather than on providing treats for the grandchild.
</P>
<P>
   Neugarten and Weinstein found this to be the most common
grandparenting style among those under 65. Although they believe
this changes as the grandparents themselves grow older, others
suggest that the changes in style reflect changes in the age of the
grandchildren. It's just a lot harder to have this kind of
relationship with a teen-ager than it is with a baby or small
child.
</P>
<P>
   Fun-seeking grandparents are most interested in their
grandchildren's friendships, how they get along with other
children, and whether they are considerate of others.
</P>
<P>
   One of the things that makes this style particularly interesting
is that we find little evidence that it existed as a grandparenting
style until comparatively recently. Very few grandparents
interviewed in the 1960s and 1970s remembered their own
grandparents as playful. Nor does this fun-seeking grandparent
appear prominently in many traditional cultures. In short, it seems
to be a modern invention.
</P>
<P>
   Formal grandparents are those who follow what they regard as the
proper and traditionally prescribed role for grandparents. Although
they like to provide special treats and indulgences for their
grandchildren and may occasionally provide minor assistance to the
parents such as baby-sitting, they make sure there is a clear
difference between parenting and grandparenting.
</P>
<P>
   They leave parenting strictly to the parents. They are very
interested in the grandchild, but are careful not to offer advice
on childrearing. Neugarten and Weinstein found this to be the most
common style among grandparents over age 65. It seems to be a style
more appropriate to older grandchildren than the fun-seeking style.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that formal grandparents have the same
expectations of ``proper'' behavior from their grandchildren as
they have for themselves. They put an emphasis on good manners,
neatness and cleanliness and self-control.
</P>
<P>
   The distant grandparent emerges from the shadows on holidays and
on special occasions such as graduations and birthdays. Unlike the
formal grandparent, the distant grandparent's contact with his
grandchild is fleeting and infrequent. This grandparent is
benevolent in stance but essentially distant and remote.
</P>
<P>
   Although distant grandparents are often those who live at a
great distance, researchers agree: geography is not destiny! It is,
to be sure, much easier to maintain a close relationship if you
live nearby, but there are lots of ways to keep in touch and
up-to-date even if you live far away. There are plenty of
grandparents who live within a few miles of their grandchildren but
have adopted a distant style.
</P>
<P>
   The reservoir of family wisdom represents a distantly
authoritarian relationship in which the grandparent -- almost
always the grandfather -- is the dispenser of special skills or
resources. Lines of authority are distinct, and the young parents
maintain and emphasize their subordinate position -- sometimes
without resentment. These grandparents put an emphasis on such
virtues as honesty, common sense and responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   A number of years ago, I spent a Fourth of July weekend with a
family whose grandfather exemplified this role. During the course
of the weekend, his wife, acting as a sort of appointments
secretary, made sure that each of his three daughters, their
husbands, and all of his more than a dozen grandchildren had time
to talk with him alone. He updated himself on everyone's activities
and usually concluded each conversation with a statement of
approval or disapproval, a recommendation regarding the future and,
when relevant, the name of a friend or acquaintance who might be of
some help.
</P>
<P>
   Some grandparents find themselves in the role of surrogate
parents. This style of grandparenting appears almost exclusively
among women. It usually occurs in situations when the young mother
works and the grandmother assumes the actual caretaking
responsibility for the child.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Department of Commerce, 62 percent of
preschoolers in poor families are cared for by relatives while
their mothers work. In 1996, more than 1.9 million children were
living with their mothers in the homes of their grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   It is not surprising that this type of grandparent holds
expectations that are very similar to those of many parents: try
hard, obey your elders, be a good student. As the name indicates,
the line between parenting and grandparenting is blurred in these
cases, with little or no formal separation of responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   In a world of runaway change, grandparents have a vital role to
play in providing security and consistency. This doesn't mean that
you can't continue to grow and change. It does mean, however, that
whatever changes take place in your life, your grandchildren always
know they can depend on you.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Your Own Role &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The roles discussed in this chapter are only a sampling of the
special positions you may have in the lives of your grandchildren.
Each of your grandchildren is different and their needs may vary.
However much you may have enjoyed being the confidant of one, do
not let that get in the way of teaching another valuable lessons or
giving another a sense of the richness of her family's history.
</P>
<P>
   Remember that it is always you who defines the role you play,
based on the circumstances and the type of relationship you have
with each grandchild and his parents. Don't let yourself get
typecast into one particular position. Be ready to grow, change,
and explore.

HOW TO BABY YOUR NEWBORN'S SKIN
</HEADLINE>
  By LEAH INGRAM 
 c.1998 Child magazine 
 World rights 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Many parents expect their newborn to enter the world looking
like the children on baby food jars. I know I did, and boy, was I
surprised the first time I saw my eldest daughter.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't look like peaches and cream. She looked like a prune.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely your baby's skin will be far from perfect during
infancy. From itchy rashes to flaking skin, a number of conditions
can affect your child in the first year of life. The good news is
that most of them can be diagnosed easily by your baby's doctor and
treated at home.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your baby is lucky enough to escape the spots, flakes
and bumps of infancy, you'll still need to remember a few things to
help his skin stay healthy. Until your newborn's circumcised penis
and/or umbilical cord have healed, give him a sponge bath every
other day. Once they have healed, he can start enjoying regular
baths in an infant tub.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bathing should be done on an as-needed basis,'' says Dr. Julie
Anne Winfield, a pediatric dermatologist at the University of
Minnesota College of Medicine in Minneapolis. ``If your baby has
been inside all day and isn't very dirty, then he might not need a
bath that night.'' However, babies who play outside every day _ or
who find bathing a soothing part of their nighttime ritual _ should
definitely have a daily bath.
</P>
<P>
   While creams aren't necessary after a bath (unless your baby
tends to have dry skin), they're good for other purposes, such as
massage, says Winfield. If you use a moisturizing cream or lotion,
choose one that's formulated for a baby's sensitive skin.
</P>
<P>
   Though most infant skin problems are perfectly harmless, some
can look a bit scary. Always check with your child's doctor if you
notice a new bump or rash to determine the best treatment. What
follows is a guide to identifying and treating the most common
conditions.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; The Facts on Flakes &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Both of my children were born looking as if they were shedding
an outer layer. They were each born past their due date, and, like
most postmature babies, they had peeling and flaking skin.
According to Dr. April Douglass-Bright, a pediatrician at the
Children's Regional Hospital at Cooper Hospital/University Medical
Center in Camden, N.J., peeling skin is an aftereffect of prolonged
exposure to amniotic fluid inside the womb.
</P>
<P>
   Early and on-time babies may look like they're molting, too, but
for a different reason: vernix caseosa, ``a whitish, cheesy coating
derived from secretions of the sebaceous glands and the normal
breakdown of a baby's epidermis,'' says Winfield. Doctors believe
it protects the skin in utero and lubricates the baby for the
journey down the birth canal.
</P>
<P>
   Peeling skin from vernix caseosa or exposure to amniotic fluid
should clear up within four weeks without treatment. But in the
meantime, it's important to prevent your baby's flaky skin from
cracking, which could lead to infection. ``After each diaper change
or bath, apply a moisturizing lotion that's made for babies,''
suggests Douglass-Bright.
</P>
<P>
   Another fairly common source of flakes is cradle cap, a
pinkish-orange scalp rash that's most prevalent in infants up to 3
months old. ``It looks like a baby's scalp has layers of scales or
really bad dandruff,'' explains Douglas-Bright. Cheryl Bogner of
Fairfield, Conn., recalls that during her daughter Ariella's bout
with cradle cap, ``if you touched her head, flakes of skin would
waft off.''
</P>
<P>
   Cradle cap almost always disappears by a child's first birthday.
In the meantime, gently rubbing some mineral oil or cooking oil
into your baby's scalp before shampooing can loosen the scales and
help minimize the flaking, says Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Spot Check &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as some kids are born with flaky skin, others are born with
spots. One you may very well notice on your newborn is a cluster of
extra blood vessels known as a salmon patch or stork bite. These
flat, light pink patches that look like splotches of paint can show
up on the eyelids or forehead or between the eyes, as well as on
the neck. Most stork bites fade completely within the first year,
says Winfield, except for those on the nape of the neck, which can
persist into adulthood.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Intent on Itching &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Eczema is one of the most common skin disorders in infants, says
Dr. Amy Paller, head of dermatology at Children's Memorial Hospital
in Chicago. In the beginning, it looks simply like an area of red,
chafed skin, or it can appear scaly, like cradle cap that has
traveled down from the scalp.
</P>
<P>
   In the first few weeks of life, a baby with eczema will not be
able to get her hands to the affected areas to scratch, so she
might try to rub them on your shirt or on the sheet in her crib.
But once babies master the art of using their hands, between 3 and
4 months of age, they will go after eczema-affected skin with a
vengeance.
</P>
<P>
   While there is no quick cure for eczema, many children outgrow
the condition within a few years. In the meantime, treatments can
help reduce the discomfort. For a bad case of eczema, your child's
doctor may prescribe a topical steroid cream or an
over-the-counter, oral antihistamine to decrease itching.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Rating the Rashes &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Nearly every parent must do battle with diaper rash, which
starts off looking like red, sunburned skin covered with tiny bumps
and may develop into a crusting rash if infected. ``Diaper rash is
the result of prolonged wetness and exposure to irritants in the
baby's urine and stool,'' says Winfield.
</P>
<P>
   The best way to prevent it, she adds, is to change your baby's
diaper frequently, especially right after a bowel movement. Use a
prepackaged wipe or warm water and mild soap to clean the area.
Follow up with an application of diaper rash cream.
</P>
<P>
   Winfield suggests choosing one with zinc oxide because it acts
as a barrier against moisture and causes the wetness from urine and
feces to bead right off the skin.
</P>
<P>
   If your baby gets diaper rash fairly often, it might be that she
has particularly sensitive skin. According to Paller, this is
probably the case if she always has diaper rash, if a rash usually
develops on her face after she eats, and/or if she get rashes that
seem to come out of nowhere.
</P>
<P>
   My youngest daughter does, so on my pediatrician's advice, I
switched to a dye- and fragrance-free detergent and stopped using
softener sheets. I tried a lot of different cleansing products to
see which ones were least irritating to her skin (Johnson &AMP;
Johnson's Ultra Sensitive line was the winner for us).
</P>
<P>
   I'm happy to report that a little patience and a lot of tender,
loving care helped clear up my daughters' bouts with peeling skin
and kept their diaper rashes and sensitive-skin problems in check.
Now my two little girls have the cherubic complexion that I always
dreamed they would.

   SCI-SUPERSTRING (Undated) _ Special report. The theory of
superstrings, physics' leading candidate for the proverbial Theory
of Everything, has been described as a piece of 21st century
physics that fell into the 20th century and will take 22nd-century
mathematics to solve. This summer the quest took a giant step
forward with a breakthrough by an Argentine/Harvard theorist, Juan
Maldacena, that excited physicists to the point of dancing a
version of the Macarena (they called it the Maldacena). A special
report, by George Johnson.

<P>
   With photo and two graphics.

<P>
   SCI-SAFINA-SHARKS (Off Montauk Point, N.Y.) _ The sea here once
boiled with sharks. The fury provided a semi-factual basis for
``Jaws'' and a whole mythology about seamen and swimmers threatened
by fierce predators with razor-sharp teeth. But today, the sharks
are fewer in number and catching one of the killers can frustrate
even professionals like Dr. Carl Safina, a marine conservationist
who was prowling off Montauk Point here recently to tag the fish
that have become his obsession. To a striking degree, Safina, 43,
has succeeded at turning his ideas into action, at times global
action. Articulate and energetic, knowledgeable and willing to take
a stand, he is something of an eco-warrior ready to fight public
indifference and lax regulators. His role has won him many friends
and foes. By William J. Broad.

<P>
   SCI-ANCIENT-AMERICANS (Undated) _ About 12,000 years ago, people
living in what is now southern Peru camped on the Pacific shore and
feasted on fish, seabirds and shellfish. The remains of stone
tools, hearths and butchered bird bones found at two Peruvian sites
are the earliest known evidence of maritime-based cultures in the
New World, scientists reported last week. By John Noble Wilford.

<P>
   SCI-PREDICTIONS (Undated) _ Scientific sages depend not on tea
leaves or the positions of planets but on tools like mathematical
modeling, statistical analysis, complexity theory, celestial
mechanics, geology, economics and epidemiology. Needless to say,
scientists discount the naive paradigms of fortune tellers, ancient
and modern. Alas, rational approaches to prediction also fail all
too often, and it may be that there are some phenomena for which
predictions will remain forever out of reach. An essay by Malcolm
Browne. (1500 words)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; STANDARD FEATURES &LR;
</P>
<P>
   SCI-COMPUTER-COLUMN (Undated) _ When shopping for a computer
system, the last features that buyers typically consider, if they
consider them at all, are the audio speakers. Most multimedia
computers are equipped with a pathetic pair of plastic-encased
speakers of a fidelity about equal to a clock radio, but now on the

equipment. By Rob Fixmer. (1100 words)

   CAESAREAN-HEALTH (Undated) _ Although hard figures are hard to

C-sections, even when they are not necessary. And doctors are
sharply divided on how to respond. Driving this turnaround are
several recent reports that question the safety of vaginal
deliveries in certain circumstances. By Susan Gilbert. (1400 words)

   BRODY-HEALTH (Undated) _ Growing numbers of Americans are
stepping daily into a potential minefield of substances loosely
referred to as dietary supplements, many of which have little or
nothing to do with the components of foods people normally consume.
And increasingly these pill poppers are getting into trouble,
suffering toxic reactions to deliberate or accidental components of
these products or sacrificing the chance to be helped by
conventional medicine. By Jane E. Brody. (``l'' code)

   STROKE-POTASSIUM-HEALTH (Undated) _ A study that tracked nearly
44,000 men over eight years has found that those whose diets

men with high blood pressure. By John O'Neil. (400 words)

SAILOR'S LETTER AMONG `TRASH' CLEANED UP FROM BAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS 3rdgraf, Kudienko Vladislav, to add letter was
undated)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ULYSSES TORASSA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A letter in an airtight container from a
Ukranian sailor seeking an American pen pal took first prize as the
most unusual thing found in the San Francisco Bay area's coastal
cleanup.
</P>
<P>
   A troop of Eagle Scouts helping clean up Angel Island won $500
for finding the handwritten letter and photo, apparently tossed
from a ship docked in the Bay.
</P>
<P>
   Kudienko Vladislav apologized in the letter for his poor English
and for causing pollution, but said he didn't want to die without
trying to make an acquaintance with someone with whom he might have
some common interests. The undated letter noted he would return
home in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so cool,'' said Judi Shils of the California Coastal
Commission. ``I just thought it would be amazing if people saw this
and everybody wrote to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Scout troop was part of a statewide turnout of more than
40,000 volunteers who scoured the coastline, lakefronts and
riverbanks Saturday under brilliant skies. They picked up at least
400,000 pounds of trash and recyclables.
</P>
<P>
   That's less than was picked up last year. Shils said people are
beginning to think twice before tossing discards in storm drains
and leaving garbage behind on beaches. The annual California
Coastal Cleanup Day, now in its 14th year, is also leaving the
waterways less cluttered.
</P>
<P>
   ``The message is getting out,'' Shils said.

   The Digital Versatile Disc format is meant to replace videotape
for home recording. But there's a problem: There is not enough
space on one side of a standard DVD to record an entire movie, so
you have to flip it over halfway through. This lack of space is one
of the reasons why no one has yet made consumer DVD
player-recorders.
</P>
<P>
   Now Matsushita of Japan says it has beaten the problem with a
novel ``sandwich'' technology that puts two layers of an erasable
recording material on one side of a 12-centimeter DVD. This creates
8.5 gigabytes of storage space, enough to record six hours of
continuous video.
</P>
<P>
   Each recording layer is made up of an alloy of germanium,
antimony and tellurium. When heated with a recording laser, the
material switches between crystalline and amorphous phases, which
are optically different and can be read by a playback laser.
</P>
<P>
   The top layer works like a two-way mirror. Only 7 nanometers
thick, it passes half the light to the lower layer, which is
separated from it by 40 micrometers of transparent resin. The laser
can quickly switch its focus from one layer to the other to create
a seamless recording. As with video or audio tape, old recordings
are erased as new ones are made. Matsushita expects viewers to
welcome a recorder that allows instant replay without rewinding,
but the movie industry is likely to object. &QL;

   ``The Farmer's Wife'' (8-10 p.m. CDT Monday and Tuesday; 8-10:30
p.m. CDT Wednesday) _ ``Frontline'' offers this splendid
independent film focusing on the intimate, real-life saga of
Juanita and Darrel Buschkoetter, a young Nebraska couple trying to
save their farm and marriage. It was shot over a three-year period
and assembled from more than 200 hours of footage. Touching and
effective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Family Name'' (9 p.m. CDT Oct. 3) _ Chronicles what happens to
a young man looking for both sides of his family _ descendants of
the white family of slave owners and the black family of slaves.
Engaging, funny, a sad truth about secrets and lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Africans in America'' (9 p.m. CDT Oct. 19-22) _ Produced by
Orlando Bagwell (''Malcolm X: Making It Plain'') this six-part,
richly detailed series examines the history of slavery in America.
The 90-minute episodes start with the evolution of slavery,
beginning in 1619 in Virginia, following through its growth and
constitutional demise at the end of the Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cats'' (Nov. 2) _ ``Great Performances'' restages this hit
musical with Elaine Paige, who created the role of glamorous
pussycat Grizabella, returning to sing ``Memory.'' The production
was recorded with the aid of a specially assembled 76-piece
orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``America 1900'' (Nov. 18) _ ``The American Experience'' offers
up this three-hour special featuring the voice of David McCullough
and produced by David Grubin (''FDR,'' ``LBJ''). It takes the first
year of what would be called ``the American century,'' a year when
war was building in the Philippines, William McKinley was
president, and that hurricane was devastating Galveston.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frank Lloyd Wright'' (Nov. 10-11) _ Ken Burns takes a crack at
the famed architect in two 90-minute segments, looking at both the
man and American architecture. He features audio recordings,
interviews and commentary from architects such as Philip Johnson
and Maya Lin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ice Mummies'' (Nov. 24) _ From ``Nova,'' this three-hour
program digs into the frozen tundra of the Andes, Siberia and the
Alps.
</P>
<P>
   ``India: Land of the Tiger'' (Nov. 15-17) _ This three-part
``Nature'' series takes viewers on a tour that brings to light the
connection between wildlife and Indian life. In the opening
segment, religion and lions of the Gir Forest are intertwined with
a look at animal life of the Ganges and the Brahmaputra _ two
sacred rivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nerds 2.0.1: A Brief History of the Internet'' (Nov. 25 ) _
Three hours chronicling the growth of the Internet, with PBS Online
columnist Robert X. Cringely (''Triumph of the Nerds''). The
question is whether Net geeks will turn away from their computers
long enough to watch.

BENNY-ACTOR (Los Angeles) _ It's uncanny, even a little spooky. One

Then something happens to the arch of his eyebrows. And before you

ago. ``Good evening, this is Jack Benny,'' says the newly morphed

. 
HUGHLEYS-TV (Los Angeles) _ Ever since ``Frasier'' moved there in
1994, television on Tuesday nights has meant a glut of sitcoms.
This season, ``Frasier'' has moved to Thursdays, but that doesn't
mean the emphasis has shifted to drama on Tuesday. Four new
sitcoms, ``The Hughleys,'' ``Sports Night,'' ``Encore! Encore!''
and ``Costello'' have been added to an evening that is already top
heavy with comedies. By Keith Marder.

SITTING AMID HISTORY: I THINK I NEED A BATH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JAY ROOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Few would dispute the notion that the Clinton
sex scandal is the biggest political story of the decade. Nor would
any reasonable person deny that we are in the midst of the gravest
constitutional crisis since the original ``-gate'' back in 1974.
</P>
<P>
   But I keep going back to those salacious details.
</P>
<P>
   Let's face it: This does not feel like Watergate. I know I'm
supposed to take it all seriously, particularly being in the news
business. And yet ...
</P>
<P>
   You'll have vO &LR; a Use me if I find it more hilarious than serious
when breathless television reporters scroll down computer screens
to read aloud what sounds like a cross between my seventh-grade sex
education class and an exceptionally low-budget porn movie.
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead and call me morally loose if I can't seem to get
lathered up about the president's sexual proclivities, or whom he
was talking to on the phone during one of those ``inappropriate''
moments he now regrets.
</P>
<P>
   OK, OK. We've got ``obstruction of justice,'' and ``perjury,''
and other ominous phrases being bandied about, reminding us of a
story that once inspired thousands of young college students to go
take journalism classes.
</P>
<P>
   Now we all just want to go take a bath.
</P>
<P>
   Forget for a moment whether there are any crimes here that merit
impeachment. The fact is, we have somehow gone from Arkansas
cronyism and corruption to a political Theater of the Absurd.
</P>
<P>
   I submit to you that this could only come from the country that
gave the world Elvis, TV talk shows and fat-free potato chips. The
story we're all ignoring is our deep, collective dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   This is O.J. in the Beltway. The United States of Jerry
Springer. Political kitsch at best. If ever there were a match made
in hell, it's the union of Bill Clinton and Ken Starr (although I
admit Lewinsky-Tripp comes close).
</P>
<P>
   Now, I'm not saying I'm a grizzled old news hound who's seen it
all. Heck, I was just a dumb kid from rural Texas in 1974 when my
dad thrust me in front of the television set and told me to watch
history being made, albeit dubiously.
</P>
<P>
   Nor am I suggesting that we just blow off this story and its
fallout for Texas and American politics. Unfortunately, it's too
late for that.
</P>
<P>
   But I frankly felt more fulfilled after covering the Branch
Davidian standoff near Waco. And, oddly, I have poignantly fond
memories of the devastating 1992 sewer system explosion that I
covered in Guadalajara, Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   I also wrote about the federal government shutdown of 1995, and
even though I now know I missed the real story (i.e., Monica's
first tryst with Bill), I didn't feel cheated.
</P>
<P>
   With all its import and gravity, I'm sure that Monicagate
probably fits the stereotype of the big story that every reporter
yearns to get in on. But if this is journalism's finest hour, I'll
gladly declare myself missing in action.

   CLINTON-VIDEOTAPE (Washington) _ President Clinton's videotaped
testimony to the grand jury provided ammunition to both sides of
the debate over whether he should be impeached. Clinton stubbornly
jousted with his interrogators, quibbling over definitions of
``sexual relations,'' attacking independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
motives and evading some questions with claims of lapsed memory. He
also exuded empathy for subordinates including Monica Lewinsky and
secretary Betty Currie, and appealed that his personal privacy be

   LEWINKSY-TESTIMONY (Washington) _ Monica Lewinsky told the grand
jury that President Clinton was her ``sexual soulmate.'' She denies
keeping her semen-stained navy blue dress as a ``souvenir,''
explaining that she didn't wear the dress for some time after her
Feb. 28, 1997, encounter with Clinton because she gained weight.
Later, she saw the stain ``and thought to myself `oh no...''' Her
confidant, Linda Tripp, discouraged her from wearing it again. By
DAN FREEDMAN.
</P>
<P>
   CONGRESS-VIDEOTAPE (Washington) _ While some Democrats in

unimaginable if Standard and Poor, the American agency that probes

TUESDAY'S SIRCOM SQUEEZE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEITH MARDER 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Ever since ``Frasier'' moved there in 1994,
television on Tuesday nights has meant a glut of sitcoms.
</P>
<P>
   This season, ``Frasier'' has moved to Thursdays, but that
doesn't mean the emphasis has shifted to drama on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Four new sitcoms, ``The Hughleys,'' ``Sports Night,'' ``Encore!
Encore!'' and ``Costello'' (which already premiered) have been
added to an evening that features ``Home Improvement,'' ``Spin
City,'' ``Mad About You,'' ``Just Shoot Me,'' ``Working'' and
``King of the Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Only one of the three new shows premiering tonight should last
the year. &QL; 
THE HUGHLEYS &QC;
</P>
<P>
   D.L. Hughley is a stand-up comedian with something to say. His
comedy is based on real-life experiences _ and so is his sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life Hughleys moved from the inner-city to West Hills _
and so do their television alter-egos.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl, as he is called in the sitcom, does not want to make any
new friends. He is offended when an elderly neighbor asks him to
help her take out the trash and is torn between his new cushy life
and the world he left behind.
</P>
<P>
   His link to the past is Milsap (John Henton), the head of sales
in Hughley's company, who visits often from the 'hood and accuses
Hughley of losing his ``blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   The show is straightforward in its approach, and the struggles
seem real. Hughley is upset and embarrassed that his daughter
selects a white doll over a black one. As it turns out, the choice
was made because the white doll came with more outfits.
</P>
<P>
   The actor Hughley does a fine job for a television newcomer and
shows timing and charisma. The stories remain solid throughout each
script, and ``The Hughleys'' teaches, not preaches.
</P>
<P>
   Nestled between an admittedly aging ``Home Improvement'' and
rising sitcom ``Spin City,'' we probably will get to know a lot
about the Hughleys during the next few seasons.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``The Hughleys.''
</P>
<P>
   What: An African-American family moves into a white suburb.
</P>
<P>
   The stars: D.L. Hughley, Elise Neal, Eric Allan Kramer, John
Henton, Marietta DePrima.
</P>
<P>
   Where: KABC (Channel 7).
</P>
<P>
   When: 8:30 p.m. Tuesdays.
</P>
<P>
   Our rating: 3{ Stars.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS NIGHT &QC;
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night,'' the show about the making of a nightly
television sports report, runs the danger of alienating both the
sports fan with its lack of attention to detail and the nonsports
fan with all the jargon thrown into the dialogue.
</P>
<P>
   There are constant references to sports stadiums and teams, but
in the pilot you'll find the baseball, football and basketball
seasons are going on at the same time. According to the calendar,
that is an impossibility.
</P>
<P>
   The show tries to be ``Larry Sanders'' meets ``SportsCenter.''
The problem here is that ESPN's ``SportsCenter'' is more
entertaining than this fictionalized version. Even the commercials
for ``SportsCenter'' pack more laughs than a half-hour of ``Sports
Night.''
</P>
<P>
   That brings us to another problem. The show tries to combine
drama with comedy, which works on hour-long shows but misses in a
half-hour format.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Sports Night.''

sports show.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Our rating: 2 Stars. &QL; 
ENCORE! ENCORE! &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Farcical physical humor, annoying characters and a woman who
goes to strangers' funerals for the food and companionship.
</P>
<P>
   This is what the creators of five-time Emmy winning ``Frasier,''
have come up with?
</P>
<P>
   Two celebrated actors _ Tony Award winners Nathan Lane and Joan
Plowright _ can't even make much of this mess. Lane plays Joseph
Pinoni, an abrasive opera star who returns to the home of his
dysfunctional family when his voice becomes strained (we should
only be so lucky). The setup is reminiscent of last year's
short-lived ``Over the Top,'' starring equally obnoxious Tim Curry.
Plowright plays the lead character's mother, Marie, who finds
friendship at funerals.
</P>
<P>
   The story lines are totally implausible. Joseph, an insulting
snob who jabbers away, is somehow able to go with his teen-age
nephew into San Francisco and pick up two beautiful women who can't
get enough of him.
</P>
<P>
   Where ``Frasier'' is the smartest comedy on network television,
``Encore!'' falls victim to formula writing: setup, bad joke;
setup, lame joke.
</P>
<P>
   A heralded show on the development slate, ``Encore'' was totally
revamped at one point before it hit the air; it's still a major
disappointment. A little bit of Lane goes a long way, a lot of him
goes nowhere. With an overdose, this could be an early casualty of
the television season.
</P>
<P>
   The show: ``Encore! Encore!''
</P>
<P>
   What: Nathan Lane, in what must be his biggest acting stretch
ever, plays a pompous womanizer. He is an opera singer with a
failing voice who goes back to his family's Napa Valley winery.
</P>
<P>
   The stars: Nathan Lane, Joan Plowright, Glenne Headly, Ernie
Sabella, James Patrick Stuart, Trevor Fehrman.

BUYING A PIANO IS LIKE BUYING A CAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WAYNE LEE GAY 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shopping, buying and caring for a piano is amazingly similar to
shopping, buying and caring for a car.
</P>
<P>
   First of all, you need a place to put it.
</P>
<P>
   Not, however, in the garage or the driveway. Pianos are
sensitive to temperature changes. That means no direct sun, and
keeping it far away from the fireplace. Don't put the piano against
an outside wall that changes temperature, and try to keep it out of
a direct draft from air-conditioning vents.
</P>
<P>
   Be prepared to spend $50-$100 twice a year for tuning and
maintenance _ just like getting the oil changed in your car.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, a good piano, well-maintained, will last a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   Buying new is the best choice. Unlike a good violin, which can
get better with age, a piano, like a car, tends to deteriorate even
in the best of circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   As for used pianos, there are some nice, well-maintained,
refurbished instruments out there; check the Yellow Pages under
piano dealers and take a peek at the classifieds. If you find a
used instrument you like, pay an independent technician $50-$100 to
take a look at it before you fall in love with it.
</P>
<P>
   You can spend as little as $3,000 and get something serviceable
to take a kid through a few years of lessons. For $5,000-$20,000
(less than you paid for the car that will wear out in five years),
you can have an instrument that, properly maintained, will last a
lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   If you're not prepared to make the total investment right away,
most dealers offer rental-purchase plans.
</P>
<P>
   Just as when you buy a car, don't pay the sticker price. The
sales staff will probably offer you a discount the minute you show
an inkling of interest, and if you let them know you're serious,
you'll get an even better deal before you leave the store. By all
means, go home and sleep on it. The good deal you're offered on
Saturday will still be good on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And by all means let the salesperson know you're looking at
other comparable instruments at other stores.
</P>
<P>
   To get a good sense of what's available in your price range,
shop first for the big four brands _ Yamaha, Steinway, Baldwin and
Kawai.
</P>
<P>
   In general, a brilliant tone and easy touch are appealing in the
showroom, but a warmer tone and slightly more resistant touch will
be more rewarding through the years.
</P>
<P>
   A good grand piano is the first choice if you have the space and
money. However, some uprights, particularly the top-line uprights
of the big four, are better than many of the high-gloss,
low-quality baby grands out of Asia.
</P>
<P>
   If you're just looking for something to put a vase and some
family portraits on, the cheap shiny grand will work nicely. Most
dealers offer plenty of both.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, the piano business in America was simple. You
bought a Steinway, a Baldwin, a Chickering, a Mason &AMP; Hamlin or a
Knabe.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the arrival of Yamaha and Kawai, followed by corporate
buyouts at Steinway and a proliferation of small Asian brands.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Yamaha and Kawai make durable instruments that compete
reasonably with the two surviving American mass-market brands,
Baldwin and Steinway.
</P>
<P>
   (Mason &AMP; Hamlin continues to produce a high-quality instrument
but doesn't market aggressively, and the Knabe and Chickering names
have been sold.)
</P>
<P>
   The new kid on the block, Young Chang, has won kudos as a good
consumer bargain.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   STEINWAY
</P>
<P>
   Uprights are $14,000-$18,000. Grands range from a 5-foot-9-inch
piano at $30,000 to a 9-foot concert grand for $80,000 _ $20,000
less than comparable pianos from Yamaha and Kawai.
</P>
<P>
   Steinway's second-tier line, Boston, manufactured in Japan,
includes uprights from $5,500 to $10,000 and grands up to a 7-foot
model for $14,000-$18,000.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YAMAHA
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-based Yamaha _ the same company that makes the
motorcycles _ entered the American market in the early 1960s with
cheap pianos, gradually upgrading to become serious competitors for
Steinway. By the 1980s, the increasingly well-made instruments were
common in college studios and even appeared occasionally on the
concert stage.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha now makes a serious bid for the top end, claiming to
match the full, rich tone that was formerly the property of
Steinway.
</P>
<P>
   The Yamaha line ranges from consoles _ short upright pianos _
for $3,595 up to a concert grand for $99,999.
</P>
<P>
   Yamaha's best bargains are at midrange, with uprights at
$5,295-$12,695 and a small grand for $13,295.

   SCI-SUPERSTRING (Undated) _ Special report. The theory of
superstrings, physics' leading candidate for the proverbial Theory
of Everything, has been described as a piece of 21st century
physics that fell into the 20th century and will take 22nd-century
mathematics to solve. This summer the quest took a giant step
forward with a breakthrough by an Argentine/Harvard theorist, Juan
Maldacena, that excited physicists to the point of dancing a
version of the Macarena (they called it the Maldacena). A special

   SCI-SAFINA-SHARKS (Off Montauk Point, N.Y.) _ The sea here once
boiled with sharks. The fury provided a semi-factual basis for
``Jaws'' and a whole mythology about seamen and swimmers threatened
by fierce predators with razor-sharp teeth. But today, the sharks
are fewer in number and catching one of the killers can frustrate
even professionals like Dr. Carl Safina, a marine conservationist
who was prowling off Montauk Point here recently to tag the fish
that have become his obsession. To a striking degree, Safina, 43,
has succeeded at turning his ideas into action, at times global
action. Articulate and energetic, knowledgeable and willing to take
a stand, he is something of an eco-warrior ready to fight public
indifference and lax regulators. His role has won him many friends
and foes. By William J. Broad.

living in what is now southern Peru camped on the Pacific shore and
feasted on fish, seabirds and shellfish. The remains of stone

are the earliest known evidence of maritime-based cultures in the
New World, scientists reported last week. By John Noble Wilford.

leaves or the positions of planets but on tools like mathematical
modeling, statistical analysis, complexity theory, celestial
mechanics, geology, economics and epidemiology. Needless to say,
scientists discount the naive paradigms of fortune tellers, ancient
and modern. Alas, rational approaches to prediction also fail all
too often, and it may be that there are some phenomena for which
predictions will remain forever out of reach. An essay by Malcolm

   KAWAI
</P>
<P>
   The Kawai line ranges from a console for $3,500 to a concert

   Uprights range from about $4,940 to $10,910. Grands range from

At these prices, Baldwin is the best bargain on the upper end among
traditional name-brand pianos.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   YOUNG CHANG
</P>
<P>
   With Yamaha and Kawai moving up, a Korean company, Young Chang,
is attacking the bargain-hunters' end of the market, beginning at
$4,000 for a console. If you want a big piano and don't care about
traditional name brands, Young Chang sells a line of grands ranging
from a baby grand for less than $10,000 to a 9-foot concert grand
for $40,000. Though you won't see one on the concert stage anytime
soon, you will find this brand recommended by Consumers Digest.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   FAZIOLI
</P>
<P>
   If you want the world's biggest, most expensive piano, you can
buy an Italian-made Fazioli by calling International Piano
Galleries, an import specialist in North Little Rock, Ark. A
10-foot-2-inch concert grand, meticulously handcrafted, will cost
you $163,400. A less overwhelming 5-foot-2-inch Fazioli grand sells
for a mere $69,200.

</P>
<P>
   THE SILENT PIANO
</P>
<P>
   So you live in an apartment and the urge to practice hits at 1
a.m. What can you do without disturbing the neighbors? Now, you can
silence your piano.
</P>
<P>
   Steinway and Young Chang dealers offer a ``Quiet Time'' option
that can be added to acoustic pianos for $2,000-$2,500, allowing
you to turn off the acoustic sound and turn on electronic sound
that you hear through headphones, but your neighbors don't.
</P>
<P>
   One Yamaha dealer recommends a Midi connection, allowing silence
and a plethora of other electronic and digital options.
</P>
<P>
   And, although electronic pianos will never replace real pianos
completely, Kawai offers an impressive line of electronic keyboards
that very nearly duplicate a real piano touch and offer a huge
range of options at the flick of a switch. Not a bad option for an
apartment-dweller for $1,700-$8,000.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin offers the similar Italian-made Pianovelle digital piano
at $2,390-$10,734.

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
HYPERION BAY  
Starring: Mark-Paul Gosselaar, Dylan Neal, Sydney Penny, Christina
Moore, Cassidy Rae, Bart Johnson, Raymond J. Barry, Cindy Pickett 
On: WB 
Time: Monday at 9 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Please don't say this is the future of the ``Dallas''-styled
nighttime soap. ``Hyperion Bay'' wants to be a newfangled family
saga, a ``Knots Landing'' skewed young to reach the WB's beloved
young-adult audience. And it's got all the standard soap opera
setups: two brooding and battling brothers, a rigid father, a
thriving but mysterious high-tech business, and a trio of women
circling the brothers.
</P>
<P>
   But the show is fairly dripping with fashionable angst and
bleakness, as well as some forced efforts to make it contemporary _
lines about how the office is ``very anti-Dilbert'' and how the
town of Hyperion Bay is ``three days ride from the nearest
Starbucks.'' It's not awful, but the scripts and the acting aren't
good enough to bring any life or distinction to the very familiar
situations.
</P>
<P>
   Mark-Paul Gosselaar plays the central character, Dennis Sweeney,
who returns to his small, struggling hometown to start up a branch
of a company that will bring riches to the local economy. He left
years earlier a bullied nerd, but now he's returning as a powerful
figure with just a little bit of revenge on his mind. ``We didn't
fit into their America,'' his boss says to Dennis about the
small-minded locals. ``But that's all gone. We're in charge. Now
they're scrambling to fit it with us.''
</P>
<P>
   And so Dennis's brother resents him, and the girl Dennis had a
crush on in high school is chasing after him _ much to the dismay
of her husband, who happens to be the guy who beat Dennis up in the
old days. Even one of Dennis's former high school principals learns
a small lesson in The New Dennis by the end of the premiere
episode. None of the actors look like they're having much fun amid
all these dark doings _ and it's easy to sympathize with them.

CONRAD BLOOM 
Starring: Mark Feuerstein, Linda Lavin, Ever Carradine, Jessica
Stone, Lauren Graham, Paula Newsome 
On: NBC 
Time: Monday at 8:30 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Conrad Bloom'' flips one of the most overdone TV formulas of
the 1990s. Instead of yet another sitcom about an unmarried woman
in the city surrounded by a whack pack of mostly male supporting
players, this show offers us a single man, the city, and an
ensemble of needy and nutty women.
</P>
<P>
   It just might work. ``Conrad Bloom'' has the potential to become
a small charmer, if it can distinguish itself from the shows that
surround it (``Suddenly Susan'' and the inferior ``Caroline in the
City'') and if it can avoid pushing characters who are quirky for
quirky's sake. It has a breezy appeal, an affable actor _ Mark
Feuerstein _ at its center, and some sharp edges from Linda Lavin,
who brings freshness to the familiar role of guilt-tripping mother.
</P>
<P>
   Feuerstein's Conrad is an ambitious ad copywriter with a good
heart. He'd love to find romance, but he's a caretaker by nature
and can't stop giving his free time over to the women in his life.
There's his tree-hugging sister; his Lilith Fair-loving
ex-girlfriend and current best friend; his no-nonsense boss; his
ditzy, breast-feeding co-worker; and, of course, Mom, who is
simultaneously manipulative and helpless. The only male in the
ensemble beside Conrad is a legendary Clio-winning ad man, played
by ``Barney Miller'' alum Steve Landesberg, who's still partying
like it's 1969. Along with Conrad's mother, he requires an awful
lot of parenting.

<P>
   With their forced segues, fickle teleprompters, and Barbie and
Ken anchors flashing squintingly bright smiles, local news channels
are a ripe subject for ridicule. ``The Brian Benben Show'' is an
energetic go at those daily newscasts, which seem to get more
sensational and less sensible with each passing
weather-crisis-of-the-moment. It borrows freely from TV series like
``Murphy Brown'' and ``NewsRadio'' as it upends the inner workings
of an LA media outlet, but it takes a distinctively bold approach
to its satire. Despite a few juvenile moments, ``The Brian Benben
Show'' has a high-strung charm.
</P>
<P>
   Benben is familiar to fans of HBO's ``Dream On,'' as the book
editor whose romantic exploits were never easy, and whose thoughts
took the form of vintage TV and movie clips. On the new show he
plays a KYLA news anchor whose work life is never easy,
particularly when he's fired and replaced by Tabitha Berkeley and a
slimy fellow named Chad Rockwell, a former VH1 video jockey who
``tested off the charts.'' One of the jokes is that Benben is no
pillar of morality, but next to the demographically correct Chad,
he looks like the good guy. The despairing Benben is rehired by
KYLA, but he's demoted to lifestyles anchor when the previous
anchor is eaten by an ape. ``Now I'm the guy who interviews bearded
ladies,'' he cries, before concocting a plan to undermine Chad with
the help of some bad jokes and a little teleprompter tampering.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Benben is a likable physical comedian who knows how to play
harried and beleaguered, and many of the laughs in ``The Brian
Benben Show'' depend of his facial reactions to the insanity around
him. As long as the writers are willing to goof on him as
frequently as they heap scorn on Barbie and Ken, ``The Brian Benben
Show'' stands a chance to be a wacky winner.

`DOCTORS' GIVES MODERN AILMENT CLICHE TREATMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
L.A. DOCTORS 
Starring: Ken Olin, Rick Roberts, Sheryl Lee, Matt Craven 
On: CBS 
Time: Monday at 10 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meet Evan Newman, father, doctor, saint. ``I want to treat
patients instead of diseases,'' he gushes with pitch-perfect
sincerity, after paying an impromptu visit to the home of a dying
man and interrupting his tight afternoon schedule to help an
elderly diabetic in a car crash. (And after taking his son to a
basketball game.)
</P>
<P>
   But don't open your phone books and start thumbing through the
``N'' pages just yet. Young and idealistic, Dr. Evan Newman is one
of those prime-time illusions, the sort of fantasy figure that the
more simplistic and manipulative TV shows use to hook viewers
(remember Marcus Welby?). With his freckles and tireless humanity,
Evan is nothing more than one of the four characters on ``L.A.
Doctors,'' an unsophisticated medical drama series. In an era of
HMOs, he's meant to be Dr. Feelgood.
</P>
<P>
   And that's the big button ``L.A. Doctors'' hopes to push. As we
face an age of depersonalized medicine, ``L.A. Doctors'' gives us
the daily conflicts of physicians who have left managed care to
start their own private practice. How will their business concerns
conflict with the business of saving lives? Can the doctors bring
in patients without selling out to the publicity machine? Don't
look to ``L.A. Doctors'' for fleshed-out answers to these
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Rick Roberts's Evan, Ken Olin from
``thirtysomething'' and ``EZ Streets'' is a prominent figure on the
show. He's supposed to be the crass rainmaker of the practice, the
Jaguar owner who commissions avant-garde art for the waiting room.
But by the end of the premiere, he, too, is making house calls and
getting touchy-feely (about not having children). One minute he's
the definitive shark, manipulating Evan into a publicist's hands.
The next he's hanging out at a pier to give some paternal advice to
a pregnant teen. Olin is a very good actor, but even he can't quite
seem to put his finger on his character's true nature. He deserves
better.
</P>
<P>
   Sheryl Lee, best recalled as Laura Palmer from ``Twin Peaks,''
joins the practice tonight, as a married workaholic who may well be
attracted to Evan. It's not clear where the writers plan to take
her.
</P>
<P>
   While ``ER'' manages to throw its doctors some unusual medical
cases, ``L.A. Doctors'' pulls out all the cliches. With the subplot
about the pregnant teen, the show borrows unimaginatively from
yesterday's news. As one of the doctors points out, we don't want
the girl's newborn to end up in a garbage can.
</P>
<P>
   In order for ``L.A. Doctors'' to survive, its writers _ and not
just the doctors themselves _ will need to avoid mistreating their
caseload.

WORKING-CLASS `KING' NEEDS MORE IMAGINATION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
THE KING OF QUEENS 
Starring: Jerry Stiller, Kevin James, Leah Remini, Lisa Rieffel 
On: CBS 
Time: Monday at 8:30 p.m. 
Rated: TVPG 
 
  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Try, try, try again. Last season, ABC blended ``Roseanne'' with
``All in the Family'' for a crummy domestic sitcom called ``That's
Life.'' The working-class couple lived in Queens, the husband was
crude and anti-intellectual, the humor was grade-school level and
close to unbearable. Fortunately, it lasted only a few weeks. This
season, CBS gives the same beef-jerky formula another go round with
slight but certainly less painful results. ``The King of Queens''
is a run-of-the-mill family comedy that wants to be the show that
follows it, ``Everybody Loves Raymond,'' but ends up more like a
wan wannabe.
</P>
<P>
   The star of the series is stand-up comedian Kevin James, who has
had a recurrent role on ``Everybody Loves Raymond'' as one of Ray's
pals. A chunky man, James's Doug Heffernan works for a UPS-like
delivery service and adores only his wife, Carrie, more than his
new 70-inch television. He's a low-level guy's guy, hanging with
his posse of loser sports lovers but snuggling up to his wife
enough to keep her happy. Leah Remini, of ``Fired Up,'' plays
Carrie as a sweet but long-suffering woman who isn't above a little
finagling to get what she wants. She's wifey, 1990s style.
</P>
<P>
   It's all fairly bland, except that Carrie's father and her
sister have just moved into her Queens home, and her father is
played by Jerry Stiller. Originally, the pilot was shot with Jack
Carter as the crusty old guy, but the creators of ``The King of
Queens'' must have recognized the need for the addition of
something distinctive like Stiller's zany, stylized craziness, not
to mention his ``Seinfeld'' cache (he played George's father). Now
``The King of Queens'' is more like ``The Jerry Stiller Show,'' and
Stiller is meant to be the equivalent of Ray Romano's nutty mother.
When he's in the action, the show does perk up.
</P>
<P>
   ``The King of Queens'' will need to intensify its characters,
and not rely solely on Stiller for color, if it wants to achieve
true slice-of-life status. The writers also will need to be more
imaginative and less socially retro. In typical fall-season
fashion, tonight's episode sets up the series' situation, as
Stiller accidentally burns his house down and moves in with his
daughter and son-in-law. But by next week the show is already
struggling for material, as Doug panics when he learns that his
late mother-in-law was a heavy woman, and that Carrie may have a
tendency to gain as she ages. It's stock stuff, and written so
lazily it doesn't even turn the tables to take the King of Queens
to task for his own Henry VIII waistline.

`SEX' LARGELY STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SENSIBLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN KOCH  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
SEX WITH CINDY CRAWFORD 
Produced by: Gay Rosenthal 
On: ABC 
Date: Tuesday 10 p.m. 
Rated: TV14, D (frank dialogue)  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An ABC press release pitching the ``Sex With Cindy Crawford''
hourlong special Tuesday tonight at 10 p.m.) is a comic keeper.
``Sex ... with Cindy Crawford?'' it begins with
quasi-self-deprecation. Then: ``Who better with whom to talk about
sex than a woman with one of the world's recognizable faces.'' Say
what?
</P>
<P>
   Forget the jackknifed syntax and goofy non sequitur: The dopey
point, I'm fairly sure, is that a supermodel sex symbol and
skin-market profiteer is the ideal facilitator for a serious TV
show on human sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Then factor in, if you will, the October Playboy, not mentioned
in ``Sex'' but featuring Crawford on the cover and promising 14
pages of new Crawford ``nudes.'' World-class, extravagantly paid
tease as earnest national sex educator. Hello?
</P>
<P>
   The first several minutes of the special, which humorlessly
observe how ``we're bombarded by sexual images,'' do nothing to
relieve doubt about the dreary silliness and shameless cynicism of
``Sex.'' Jerry Springer appears as an expert witness on sex and the
media. Among other things, we learn that ``virtual intercourse,''
which is somehow connected to the popularity of Internet sex, is
just a few years off.
</P>
<P>
   So imagine my considerable surprise when the too-coyly titled
``Sex With Cindy Crawford'' finally settled down, relatively
speaking, and talked sense, occasionally with something approaching
sensitivity.
</P>
<P>
   The segments are too short and, often, stylishly fragmented a la
MTV to capture the attention of young adults (which is also of
course the rationale for using Crawford as centerpiece). But the
on-camera teenagers speak honestly about the pressures and
anxieties surrounding sex, and have sensible advice for their
peers. The conversations about sex among straight and gay adults at
a Midwestern barbecue convened for the TV show are candid without
being clinical and, if predictable, often reassuringly humane.
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate message is that love, candor, and fidelity are
terrific sexual aids. Relationships count, and so does the careful
practice of safe sex, we are gently admonished by a lot of nice
ordinary people and by Cindy, too.
</P>
<P>
   The show also includes the unremarkable results of a nationwide
sex survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation.

BIOTECH LEADER PLOWS AHEAD UNDER NEW LEADERSHIP 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WENDY TANAKA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Genentech Inc., a trailblazer in the American
biotechnology industry, is finally reaping the benefits of a
reorganization that began three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the South San Francisco-based biotechnology company
received approval to market Rituxan, which cures a certain type of
lymphoma and took seven years to develop. So far, it has grossed
$78 million in sales.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is awaiting the green light for its vaunted breast
cancer drug, Herceptin. The Food and Drug Administration is
expected to approve the sale of the bioengineered formulation by
December.
</P>
<P>
   And Genentech has a string of other products in late-stage
clinical trials, including drugs that cure allergies and asthma,
and treat nerve damage caused by diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an amazing turnaround story,'' said Meirav Chovav, an
analyst at Salomon Smith Barney in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, Genentech had been mired by controversial
marketing tactics and a questionable financial arrangement pursued
by then-chief executive G. Kirk Raab. Both situations detracted
from Genentech's ability to roll-out new drugs, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Financially, however, Genentech has been humming along thanks to
a $2.1 billion investment from Swiss drug giant Roche Holding Ltd.
in 1990. The investment _ which included about $500 million in cash
earmarked for research to maintain the company's long-term product
pipeline _ resulted in Roche acquiring 66 percent of Genentech.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Genentech's revenues are robust, analysts said. Last
year, the company passed the $1 billion sales mark. And net income
was $129 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In a recent interview at Genentech's sprawling, maze-like campus
at One DNA Way, the chief financial officer, Louis J. Lavigne said
that in the next millennium he expects his company's sales to grow
20 percent to 30 percent a year. Profits, he added, should rise to
at least 25 percent of sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the most exciting times in the company, and the
reason for that is seeing the pipeline moving forward and
recognizing the potential that it has for meeting the various unmet
needs of patients,'' Lavigne said.
</P>
<P>
   Once a Genentech scientist makes a discovery in the lab,
pre-clinical tests are conducted to determine whether the discovery
is suitable for humans. If it is, the product goes into the first
of three clinical trials. After the drug passes the last trial, the
company takes its results to the FDA, which must approve it.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech spokeswoman Laura Leber said the time it takes new
drugs to go from the research stage to market is about 10 to 12
years on average for the industry.
</P>
<P>
   The cost of developing a new drug, she said, can run into the
hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech was founded in 1976 by venture capitalist Robert
Swanson and molecular biologist Herbert Boyer to commercialize
genetically engineered products.
</P>
<P>
   Boyer held a patent on techniques for splicing genes into
micro-organisms that could be used as ``microfactories'' to produce
large amounts of therapeutic substances.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bob Swanson took the entrepreneurial lessons he learned from
Silicon Valley and applied them to biology companies,'' said
Cynthia Robbins-Roth, a former Genentech researcher and now editor
of BioVenture View, a trade newsletter base in San Mateo.
</P>
<P>
   ``That model (Genentech) has successfully created an industry
with 300-plus companies,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Industry watchers said Genentech's latest upward trend began
with the ouster of Raab in 1995 and the promotion of Dr. Arthur
Levinson to chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Raab, who had been appointed chief executive in 1990, was fired
by the Genentech board after trying to secure a $2 million personal
loan guarantee from Roche.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time he was negotiating a personal loan, Raab was in
the midst of hashing out a new financial arrangement with the Swiss
drug maker _ one that gives Roche the option to buy the rest of
Genentech by July 1999 if Genentech's stock falls below $60 per
share at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Raab said he ``never took that loan. But I did something very
foolish. It was inappropriate.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said the discussed loan from Roche may have been the
last straw for Raab, who had previously spearheaded a controversial
marketing campaign for Genentech's human growth hormone drug,
Protropin, that combats dwarfism.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, Genentech was accused of pushing the drug to
parents of children considered small for their age but still normal
size.
</P>
<P>
   The company was later sued for allegedly paying $1 million to a
Minneapolis doctor for pushing the use of Protropin.
</P>
<P>
   Raab defended his decisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what Genentech did was wonderful in terms of the
marketing,'' he said. ``I've seen all sorts of children who've
gotten it, and instead of being 4-feet-10-inches, they are
five-feet-four.''
</P>
<P>
   Raab is now on the boards of four biotechnology companies:
Shaman Pharmaceuticals Inc., LXR Biotechnology Corp. and Connetics
Corp., all in California; and Oxford Glycosciences Ltd. in Oxford,
England.
</P>
<P>
   Levinson, who had been head of research and development at
Genentech, immediately replaced Raab and is credited with creating
the company's current product pipeline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since 1995 we've been in a period that I would call a
reinvigoration of the company,'' Lavigne said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chovav of Salomon Smith Barney put it more bluntly: ``Art
Levinson is probably the best thing that happened to Genentech,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   To accomplish its production goals, Genentech has been forging
strategic alliances with other biotech and pharmaceutical outfits.
That way, development costs are shared and products get to market
faster because two companies are involved.
</P>
<P>
   Genentech also hasn't cut back on research and development. In
1995, Genentech spent $363 million, or 40 percent of sales, on
research and development. The following two years, the company
spent $471 million, or about 50 percent of revenues.

   TREE-VILLAGE _ Lost Tree Village, like plenty of other gated
communities in South Florida, offers its residents a country club,
beach house, pro shops, even a chapel. But what sets it apart is
its optional, residential tax write-off _ an elite, IRS-approved
philanthropy, which allows donors to take a charitable tax
deduction for up to 50 percent of their adjusted gross income in a
single year. (Murawski, Palm Beach Post) MOVED.

   TECH-TOOLS _ I wouldn't expect much from a machine that claims
to copy and scan, with an automatic document feeder and optical
character recognition, all for a list price of $250. In the case of
the Lumina PCC, I was mistaken. (Warner, Atlanta

<P>
   TECH-MEDIA _ If there's one thing that's certain about PCs, it's
that sooner or later they break down. The October issue of PC World
devotes its cover story to how to figure out what's wrong and fix
it. Better yet, the issue offers tips on how to improve the
performance of PCs that are working. (Haddad, Atlanta

   TECH-REPORT _ For most of this century, bigger was better and
biggest was best, whether the topic was a new ocean liner or a

   TECH-KIDS _ Small Wonders'' was a huge hit in the Farris
household, in Mableton. The PC fighting game of action toys
captivated reviewer Jesse Farris, 12, and his brothers _ Jacob, 9,

   TECHNOBUDDY _ By now, many of you have a whole new set of

isn't going to be a diatribe (well, I will rant just a little)
against Windows 98. But if you're like me, you spent several years
tuning up Windows 95. Things like that take a lot of time and a lot

<TEXT>
<P>
   About 12,000 years ago, people living in what is now southern
Peru camped on the Pacific shore and feasted on fish, seabirds and
shellfish. The remains of stone tools, hearths and butchered bird
bones found at two Peruvian sites are the earliest known evidence
of maritime-based cultures in the New World, scientists reported
last week.
</P>
<P>
   The new findings, described in the current issue of the journal
Science, also provide further proof that people were in America
earlier than once thought. Of possibly even more importance, they
support an emerging view of how the first Americans lived and how
they migrated through the length of North and South America.
</P>
<P>
   This rethinking of the peopling of the New World is becoming one
of the liveliest areas of research and controversy in American
archeology.
</P>
<P>
   In the new view, it appears that the earliest Americans were not
all hunters spearing big game like mammoths and bison, as they have
long been portrayed in prehistoric studies. The Peruvian
discoveries, along with other recent research, show that many of
the people who first inhabited the Americas relied on diverse
resources for survival: big game and small, plants and fruits,
marine life and just about anything at hand.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Daniel H. Sandweiss of the University of Maine at Orono, who
directed research at one of the sites, said in a telephone
interview: ``This finally makes it abundantly clear that these
people had a very diverse subsistence system and were prepared to
exploit all different kinds of food sources almost as soon as they
arrived in America. We had thought this before, but we can prove it
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Research by Dr. Anna C. Roosevelt, an archeologist at the Field
Museum and the University of Illinois in Chicago, had already found
that people living 11,000 years ago in the Amazon basin had
opportunistic subsistence economies that seldom included big game.
Likewise, the oldest confirmed settlement site in the Americas, at
Monte Verde in southern Chile, was occupied 12,500 years ago by
people who ate mastodon meat when available but more usually dined
on potatoes, mushrooms, grasses, nuts, berries and freshwater
shellfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now there's recognition that early Americans did not live by
mammoth alone,'' said Dr. David J. Meltzer, an archeologist at
Southern Methodist University in Dallas, commenting on the Peruvian
findings.
</P>
<P>
   Until last year, when archeologists finally accepted the
antiquity of the Monte Verde site, the earliest confirmed traces of
human activity in the Americas had been 11,200-year-old stone spear
points discovered in the 1930s near Clovis, N.M.
</P>
<P>
   The distinctive points were later found scattered throughout
much of the two continents, creating the impression of the first
Americans as almost exclusively big-game hunters. This led to the
prevailing hypothesis that the New World was first populated in the
last ice age by hunters crossing the frozen Bering Strait in
pursuit of game, then moved south through an ice-free corridor
between glaciers in the continental interior and eventually made it
by foot all the way to the tip of South America.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. David K. Keefer of the United States Geological Survey in
Menlo Park, Calif., a geologist and leader of the team that
explored the second Peruvian site, said the new evidence of such
early maritime-oriented cultures bolstered the case for an
alternative migration theory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our site,'' he said in a telephone interview, ``is about the
best kind of evidence you're going to find for the idea of coastal
migration _ not conclusively probably, but very strong evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Knut Fladmark, an archeologist at Simon Fraser University in
Vancouver, B.C., proposed the coastal migration hypothesis in the
1970s, but the idea gained few adherents until recently. Geologic
and paleoenvironmental studies have begun showing that there
probably was not a clear passage between the glaciers early enough
to enable people to migrate through the North American interior in
time to reach places as far south as Peru, Brazil and Chile when
new archeological evidence establishes that they were there.
</P>
<P>
   New estimates, Fladmark said last week, indicate that the
corridor between the glaciers, on the eastern flank of the Rocky
Mountains, did not open until 11,500 years ago. If the newcomers to
America could not move south through the interior, they might have
migrated along the western coast, on foot along the shore and by
skin-covered boats for stretches.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sandweiss is reserving judgment as to whether the Peruvian sites
support the coastal-migration hypothesis. At the site he studied,
the people appeared to have occupied it seasonally and spent the
rest of the year in the nearby highlands, possibly engaged mostly
in hunting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coastal migration is possible, but neither site provides
clear evidence for it at this time,'' Sandweiss said. ``We need a
good number more sites up and down the coast to establish anything
about migrations.''
</P>
<P>
   An advocate of the coastal-migration hypothesis, Dr. Carole A.S.
Mandryk of Harvard University, said the Peruvian findings ``make me
really happy'' because they show a culture oriented to the sea and
its resources that was living as far south as Peru early enough
that their ancestors presumably could not have found a way through
the interior glaciers of the ice age. Instead, she said, they would
probably have taken the coastal route.
</P>
<P>
   Finding evidence of early coastal settlements and migrations was
once thought to be hopeless. At the end of the ice age, melting
glaciers raised sea levels and inundated what had been the ancient
shorelines. But off Peru, the sea floor drops off so steeply that
when the sea levels rose, not much land was submerged. Buried
remains of settlements close to the ice-age coast might still be
recoverable.
</P>
<P>
   Both discovery sites are in the arid south of Peru, near
Arequipa. The site Keefer's group excavated, called Quebrada
Tacahuay, was about a half-mile from the present shore. As a
geologist, Keefer was originally looking for buried evidence of the
effects of ancient El Ninos on early cultures.
</P>
<P>
   Layers of sediments revealed deposits of mud and rock from
floods brought about by El Nino, a Pacific Ocean warm-water current
that every few years generates storms and heavy rain along the
western coasts of the Americas and droughts in Australia and Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Deep among the flood deposits, the geologists and archeologists
found the charcoal and stones of a cooking hearth, radiocarbon
dated at 10,700 years, or about 12,700 calendar years old. Further
exploration turned up an abundance of seabird bones, particularly
cormorants and boobies. Butcher marks suggest that the people were
removing the meaty breast parts. The second most abundant remains
were anchovy bones. Only a few bones of terrestrial animals were
found.
</P>
<P>
   ``The remains of such small, schooling fish at the site suggest
the use of specialized fish-netting technology,'' the scientists
reported in the Science article.
</P>
<P>
   The second site, called Quebrada Jaguay and worked by Sandweiss'
group, was a few miles inland by the bed of seasonal stream flowing
out of the highlands to the coastal desert. People occupied the
site for a time 13,000 to 11,000 years ago, gathering clams and
small fish of the drum family. Archeologists found some stone
tools, petrified wood and small pieces of obsidian as cutting
tools.
</P>
<P>
   In their Science report, Sandweiss and his colleagues said the
bones and stones at Quebrada Jaguay suggest that the people there
were foragers who spend part of their time in the highlands and
part on the coast exploiting marine resources. While at the shore,
they relied almost exclusively on the sea for food.
</P>
<P>
   ``This conclusion supports other recent studies showing early
diversification of subsistence beyond an economy based on the
hunting of large game,'' the scientists wrote.

BILLY CLYDE'S BACK, STILL UNCOUTH AND HILARIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Some books are written to inspire high-toned intellectual
debate. ``Rude Behavior'' is not one of these.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, this third installment of the fictional adventures of
Billy Clyde Puckett and friends is Dan Jenkins setting out to
offend as many delicate sensibilities as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Behavior'' is less a structured novel than a series of
politically incorrect one-liners. If you're touchy on the subject
of race, sex, gender (as opposed to sex), politics, football,
economics, low-fat diets, proper grammar and/or religion, do not
read this book; your indignation glands will kick in should you
peruse even a single paragraph at random.
</P>
<P>
   But if you share Jenkins' obvious frustrations with our
homogenized modern society, on every other page or so you'll
probably bust a gut laughing. Tarrant County natives will be
especially entertained by homeboy Jenkins' descriptions of Fort
Worth as it was and as it has become, especially concerning bars
and restaurants. (Billy Clyde, Jenkins' fictional alter ego,
proposes a new north side restaurant called ``Kill 'Em and Eat
'Em.'')
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Behavior'' does include an implausible story line for
those who insist on plot. Billy Clyde and his father-in-law,
wealthy Fort Worth oilman Big Ed Bookman, are in the running for
one of two new teams in an expanded National Football League. Their
competitors are based in London, Honolulu and Mexico City. Big Ed
wants to locate his franchise in the middle of barren West Texas
``between Amarillo and Lubbuck,'' then build a new condo community
around the stadium. Eventually, all four applicants are welcomed
into the NFL, and the West Texas Tornadoes embark on an unlikely
first season that ends with the fledgling franchise in the Super
Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   All the other ``Semi-Tough'' characters you've loved or loathed
are along for the ride: Barbara Jane, Billy Clyde's soulmate and
wife who's trying to make the transition from starlet to director;
Shake Tiller, wide receiver-turned-novelist; familiar Billy Clyde
drinking buddies Jim Tom Pinch and Tommy Earl Bruner; plus a new
member of Team Whacko, bartender Kelly Sue Woodley, a Barbara Jean
clone who ends up taming the sexually irrepressible Shake.
</P>
<P>
   Best of all, Jenkins resurrects T.J. Lambert, the flagrantly
flatulant TCU football coach who follows up a national collegiate
championship run with the Horned Frogs (now there's sensationalist
fiction!) by leading the Tornadoes into the Super Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   All this matters less, however, than scenes Jenkins crafts
sentence by sentence, paragraph by paragraph into hilarious screeds
against social pomposity. Even the most experienced male sexist
pigs will learn new terms for ``cleavage.''
</P>
<P>
   The best scenes are set in the tiny West Texas town of Gully
Creek, where newly appointed Tornadoes general manager Billy Clyde
sets up shop in a trailer and oversees construction of a new
mega-football stadium. The citizens of Gully Creek (pop. 6,700)
already think they have big-time football, thank you very much. As
Jenkins notes, the Gully Creek Fightin' Roosters can even play
their games at night ``if everybody turned on the headlights in the
cars and trucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Clyde takes his meals at a cafe called Them Two Women, and
Sunday worship is conducted at one of two churches _ the little
one, ``for Catholics,'' and the big one, ``for Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rude Behavior'' is not going to be among the Pulitzer
finalists. But the open-minded among us will laugh a lot more while
reading it than we did plowing through ``Lonesome Dove.''

IMPROVING HOME COMPUTER AUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
   (The Science Times)  
(jt) 
 By ROB FIXMER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When shopping for a computer system, the last features that
buyers typically consider, if they consider them at all, are the
audio speakers. Most multimedia computers are equipped with a
pathetic pair of plastic-encased speakers of a fidelity about equal
to a clock radio.
</P>
<P>
   These acoustic toys are adequate because many computers sold
today are for offices, where any sound above two decibels is likely
to be too loud and anything that smacks of entertainment is frowned
upon.
</P>
<P>
   But the audio capabilities of today's Macintosh or Pentium-class
computers can match and in some ways exceed good high-fidelity home
stereo equipment. And for many home users, game enthusiasts or
people who use multimedia technologies for sales or other
presentations, a set of true high-fidelity speakers is desirable if
not essential.
</P>
<P>
   For that reason, a sizable market has grown up around high-end
speaker systems for computers, with some of the most respected
brands in audio, including Altec-Lansing and Bose, offering
high-fidelity speakers that can transform a standard desktop
computer into a first-rate stereo sound system.
</P>
<P>
   The best of these speaker systems are highly directional in
order to take full advantage of the state of the art in so-called
dynamic or interactive 3-D audio _ technologies that trick the ear
into hearing sounds all around the head though they are coming from
speakers in front of the listener. In contrast, static 3-D audio,
or surround sound, achieves the three-dimensional illusion by
assigning stereophonic sounds to front and rear speakers, a
technology that is often worth the expense and effort in a home
theater environment but impractical for multimedia computer setups.
</P>
<P>
   With dynamic and interactive 3-D audio, spatial and directional
illusions are achieved by manipulating audio signals based on
knowledge of how our heads and outer ears interact with and modify
sounds arriving from different directions. By selectively delaying,
echoing or intensifying certain sounds and creating acoustical
collisions in which sounds cancel each other out to varying degrees
when reaching the ear, these technologies can achieve remarkable
acoustical illusions.
</P>
<P>
   These highly complex manipulations of sound are crucial to
gaming and other virtual reality environments in which every move
of a joystick can result in a different three-dimensional movement
within an infinite sphere of virtual directions. Any latency in the
audio response to such movements will greatly diminish the
illusion.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the challenges of reproducing sound faithfully
across the audible spectrum, 3-D technologies require that speakers
be highly directional because real acoustical ambience _ that is,
the reflections and absorption of sound in our environment _
competes with the 3-D illusion at the outer portion of the ear, or
pinna, and muddies the cues interpreted as spatial perception.
</P>
<P>
   It is necessary to eliminate as many environmental variables as
possible, and directional speakers go a long way toward preventing
reflections of sound bouncing off desktops, monitors and walls.
</P>
<P>
   The most advanced design to satisfy all these demands on
computer speakers was introduced by the Sonigistix Corp. of
Vancouver, British Columbia. Its $229 system, known as Monsoon, is
designed to maximize the acoustic illusions of 3-D audio by
employing two highly-directional, flat-panel speakers that are
placed on either side of the user's monitor, plus a subwoofer unit
placed under the desk.
</P>
<P>
   The subwoofer combines bass sounds below 200 hertz from both
stereo channels. This does not impair the spatial illusion because
deep bass sounds are the least directional of all audio cues, which
is why it is much harder to determine the direction of a thunder
clap, for example, than the direction of a siren. For this reason,
almost all subwoofers produce bass in mono, although most make the
cut at 90 to 150 hertz.
</P>
<P>
   While the Monsoon's bass response is respectable, it is the
system's 4-inch by 8-inch flat-panel satellite speakers that are
truly impressive. The flat design _ only a half-inch thick _
projects sounds to the rear as well as forward and prevents most
sound reflections from objects on either side of the speaker. They
are also angled 30 degrees upward to eliminate reflections from the
surface of the desktop.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with all computer speaker systems, the Monsoons
provide their own built-in amplifier. But it is impossible to know
how much power you are getting for your money, because Sonigistix
does not rate the output in RMS, or root mean squared, watts per
channel, which is the only honest measurement of power and the only
figure you can use in comparison shopping.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever their actual output, in three days of throwing every
audio source imaginable at them, the speakers, consistently
produced sound that rivaled the performance of high-end component
system speakers.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of fidelity, they were impressive within a broad
dynamic range, handling with equal agility the explosive climaxes
of Hayden's Concerto for Trumpet and Orchestra, subtle nuances of a
Yo-Yo Ma performance of Bach's Suite No. 3 for Cello and the
gut-pounding rhythm section of the bassist Ernest Ranglin's reggae
instrumentals.
</P>
<P>
   But where the Monsoons truly differentiated themselves was in
their articulation of 3-D audio. A demo of ``Grim Fandango,'' a
soon-to-be-released game from LucasArts, immersed the player in a
vivid cacophony of urban sounds triggered by the position and
movement of the on-screen character relative to sound sources and
reflective surfaces like buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, while the environmental illusions were remarkably
realistic, they were also limited to a relatively small listening
area. Audio fidelity was good anywhere within the room, but to
experience the full effect of 3-D audio, the listeners had to keep
their heads within the speakers' ``sweet spot'' _ the area where
the sounds meet in front of the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The owner's manual offers very precise instructions for speaker
placement, because it is so crucial to the Monsoon's performance.
Yet, every listening environment will be different, so it is
necessary to experiment with the placement of the speakers, trying
several arrangements until the maximum spatial illusion is created
where your head is generally held while working at the computer.
</P>
<P>
   It is best to keep in mind that ultimately this is a matter of
preference. There is really no such thing as spatial fidelity,
because 3-D audio, like many other audio technologies, is as much
psychology as physics.
</P>
<P>
   Micron Electronics recently announced that it was shipping
Monsoons as standard equipment with its top-of-the-line Millennia
desktop systems and as optional equipment with its other computer
lines. Technical specifications and more information on the
speakers are available on line at http://www.monsoonpower.com.

</P>
<P>
   Q. How do birds have sexual intercourse?
</P>
<P>
   A. Parents have supposedly explained human reproduction to
children in terms of the birds and the bees; if birds were really
used to make this explanation, it would be widely believed that
fertilization occurs after the briefest period of proximity of the
waste elimination organs.
</P>
<P>
   Most birds do not have external sex organs, according to
``Ornithology,'' a manual by Frank B. Gill (W.H. Freeman &AMP; Co.).
The transfer of sperm from male to female usually takes place while
the male bird is standing or treading on the female's back. The
male twists his tail under that of the female so that the opening
of the male bird's cloaca, or waste storage chamber, is close to
that of the female's.
</P>
<P>
   Sperm transfer takes place when both cloacae open outward. Tiny
projections called papillae protrude from the back walls of the
male's sperm sacs into his cloaca. These are brought into contact
with the opening of the female's oviduct, or egg tube (most female
birds have only one that works), and the sperm is released to
fertilize the eggs.
</P>
<P>
   The contact is usually described by ornithologists as a
``cloacal kiss.'' It usually lasts one or two seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Readers are invited to submit questions about science to

   On a recent visit to Manhattan from New Jersey, I took my
9-year-old son, Brendan, on the subway. I noticed he looked a bit
nervous walking through the station at Port Authority, as his
subway experience was very limited. As the doors shut on the car, I
could see the uneasiness on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The train started moving, and as we came to a bend in the
tracks, the conductor loudly announced something that was
unintelligible because of the defective speaker system. I noticed
Brendan listening intently, trying to understand the instructions.
The train was screeching around a sharp right turn, and he was
leaning over sideways in his seat, almost as though he were trying
to help steer the train with his body.

yelled, ``Did he say `lean right'?''

<P>
   For at least a year, Debra Nussbaum Cohen had been after her
husband, Marc Cohen, to have his hearing checked. Though it had
never been a problem in their eight years together, she now needed
to repeat everything she said, sometimes twice, and it was, in her
words, ``driving me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of increasingly annoyed nudging, her husband made
an appointment. Before the tests began, the audiologist asked why
he had come, and Cohen explained the reason. The doctor nodded
sagely. The tests were conducted and the diagnosis was that Cohen's
hearing was perfect. The audiologist's advice to Cohen was this:
``Start listening to your wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said that every day he saw at least one man propelled
into his office by a frustrated wife, only to be told that his
hearing was perfect. It seems that inattentive husbands of
long-suffering wives are part of the bread-and-butter of the
audiologist business.
</P>
<P>
   This story took place around 1965 at the Municipal Cafeteria on
Canal Street, between Centre and Lafayette streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those cafeterias (a few of them are still around)
where you passed through a turnstile, and in the process picked up
a ticket. As you removed the ticket from the machine, a loud
``bong'' sounded. The tickets were punched by the servers behind
the counters as you selected your meal. There were numeric
increments imprinted starting with 5 cents and progressing to a
dollar, $2, $3, $4, $5 and maybe $10.
</P>
<P>
   One day I was at the coffee and dessert counter, which was
served by an orange-haired, gum-chewing waitress. She was pouring
coffee, pushing Danish across the counter, punching tickets and
shouting, ``Next.'' The four-step progression had a musicality
about it. We crowded around this minor deity, who was elevated by a
behind-the-counter platform, raised our tickets and gave our
orders.
</P>
<P>
   A small man in our midst elbowed his way into visibility and
tried to get her attention. ``Lady, I want a cup of coffee,'' he
called out. Without a word, she continued what she was doing.
``Lady, I want a cup of coffee,'' he said again. She continued to
ignore him. Still louder, there was another ``Lady, I want a cup of
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point she leaned forward and and in a voice of great
condescension responded, ``Tell me, mister, what are you going to
do with three cups of coffee?'' The rest of us were almost as
delighted with the riposte as she was.

   &UR; Doctors' Qualms About CPR &LR;
</P>
<P>
   More than half of the doctors at a New York hospital said they
would not give mouth-to-mouth resuscitation to a cardiac arrest
patient, even in the face of low risk of infection and high
likelihood of success.
</P>
<P>
   The CPR survey anonymously questioned 227 residents and 96
faculty members at a 655-bed teaching hospital in Brooklyn. The
results were presented at a recent meeting of the Society for
Academic Emergency Medicine and appeared in Resuscitation, a
monthly journal.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, 55 percent of respondents said they would not perform
cardiopulmonary resuscitation in a cardiac emergency without a
protective bag-valve mask, and results varied with the hypothetical
circumstances. Twenty percent to 30 percent were unwilling to
ventilate a newborn or a child, 50 percent to 60 percent an unknown
man and 70 percent to 80 percent a trauma victim or a man they
suspected was gay.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unwillingness to help other people reflects where we are
as a society,'' said Dr. Barry Brenner, the lead author of the
study and vice chairman of the department of emergency medicine at
Brooklyn Hospital Center. He declined to say whether the study was
conducted at his hospital. ``This dirty little secret bears poorly
on our profession,'' Brenner said.

   &UR; By BILL TAMMEUS &LR;  &QC;   &UR; Bill Tammeus, The Kansas City Star
 &LR;  Release of Mr. Clinton's videotaped testimony raises the question
of whether there's a market for pay-perjure-view TV.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'THE TONIGHT SHOW WITH JAY LENO' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``How many have read the Ken Starr report? It said in the report
that Monica Lewinsky once brought President Clinton a pizza, and
then gave him oral sex. You know, I used to think it was great just
getting extra cheese!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This has gotta be a strange time to own a newsstand. 'Hey kid!
Quit looking at that Time magazine! Put that Newsweek down! Filthy
kids, looking at that Wall Street Journal.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's probably the first time in history men aren't grabbing
the sports section first. 'Honey, will you give me the oral
section? I wanna see how Clinton did over the weekend.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good to see America reading again, isn't it? If Bill
Clinton is remembered for anything, he helped make the country more
literate. Everybody's reading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It is really unbelievable. You can't even joke. But I did
learn some stuff from reading it. Did you know this? Anybody know
what the ``D.C.'' stands for in Washington D.C.? 'Disappearing
Cigars.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``That House Judiciary committee met to decide whether to
release President Clinton's videotape testimony before the Grand
Jury to the public. Today, the Democrats said yes, they will go
along with the tape being released, as long as the hair gel scene
is edited out so they can get a PG rating.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people are comparing what's happening with Clinton to
what happened with Nixon. Think it's the same thing? I don't think
there's any comparison. I doubt there's any 22-year-old in the
world who would have sex with Nixon and then be willing to talk
about it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you know the Miss America contestants can now use fanny
glue? They use it to keep their bathing suits in place. They
actually glue the back of the bathing suits to their rear ends to
keep the suits up. What a great gift this would make for your
plumber or repairman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what I love about the Emmys? You ever notice when the
winner's coming down the aisle towards the podium, the announcer
always gives you those statistics. 'This is his second Emmy in
eight nominations' or 'This is her third try after having never won
before.' You know, give the statistics people want. 'She's on her
fourth boob job.' 'Although he's a romantic lead, he's really
gay.'''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; QUOTABLES FROM NBC'S 'LATE NIGHT WITH CONAN O'BRIEN' &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday at a luncheon, the Democratic National Chairman
introduced President Clinton and praised him for his 'moral
leadership.' Then the two of them high-fived and spent the rest of
the day at Hooters.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been reported that President Clinton is going to meet
with a minister once a week to help him avoid temptation. The only
problem is she's a really hot minister.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday in New York, President Clinton attended the Broadway
musical 'The Lion King.' To make sure the President wasn't
embarrassed by the play, the producers removed the scene with
Simba, Nala and the cigar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The House Judiciary Committee is considering releasing the
videotaped testimony where President Clinton talks about his
relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Apparently the tape is called
'Too Hot for Jerry Springer.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Monica Lewinsky's rabbi lashed out at President
Clinton for shaming the country and called him a boy in a man's
job. The rabbi also said he's encouraging Lewinsky to find a nice
Jewish president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A public relations expert says if Monica Lewinsky wants to put
her life back together, she should get married. Monica says she
hasn't received any wedding proposals yet, but she has been invited
to several bachelor parties.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday Czech President Vaclav Havel and President Clinton
had a joint press conference and nine out of 10 questions were
about the sex scandal. Today, Havel and Clinton announced they are
going to be the new hosts of MTV's 'LoveLine.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yesterday, Newt Gingrich told a group of Republicans that
President Clinton is a woman-hater. In response, the President
said, 'Apparently. he has not been paying attention.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are talking about releasing the videotape of President
Clinton's Grand Jury testimony that shows that he got very agitated
during the four hours of questioning. Mostly because that's the
longest he's ever gone without oral sex.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Republicans say they decided not to release 120 sections of
Kenneth Starr's report because they were too sexually explicit.
Plus they're saving those parts for a pay-per-view special.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Kenneth Starr's daughter will be a freshman at Stanford
University this fall where Chelsea Clinton is already a sophomore.
Chelsea says it's great to be back at school and she can hardly
wait for freshman hazing to begin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day somebody slipped a lit firecracker through the
mail slot of Monica Lewinsky's home in California. Monica said she
was shaken up, but not half as much as the time someone played a
trick on her with an exploding cigar.''

</P>
<P>
   On a recent visit to Manhattan from New Jersey, I took my
9-year-old son, Brendan, on the subway. I noticed he looked a bit
nervous walking through the station at Port Authority, as his
subway experience was very limited. As the doors shut on the car, I
could see the uneasiness on his face.
</P>
<P>
   The train started moving, and as we came to a bend in the
tracks, the conductor loudly announced something that was
unintelligible because of the defective speaker system. I noticed
Brendan listening intently, trying to understand the instructions.
The train was screeching around a sharp right turn, and he was
leaning over sideways in his seat, almost as though he were trying
to help steer the train with his body.
</P>
<P>
   When I asked him if he was OK, he looked at me frantically and
yelled, ``Did he say `lean right'?''

</P>
<P>
   For at least a year, Debra Nussbaum Cohen had been after her
husband, Marc Cohen, to have his hearing checked. Though it had
never been a problem in their eight years together, she now needed
to repeat everything she said, sometimes twice, and it was, in her
words, ``driving me nuts.''
</P>
<P>
   After months of increasingly annoyed nudging, her husband made
an appointment. Before the tests began, the audiologist asked why
he had come, and Cohen explained the reason. The doctor nodded
sagely. The tests were conducted and the diagnosis was that Cohen's
hearing was perfect. The audiologist's advice to Cohen was this:
``Start listening to your wife.''
</P>
<P>
   The doctor said that every day he saw at least one man propelled
into his office by a frustrated wife, only to be told that his
hearing was perfect. It seems that inattentive husbands of
long-suffering wives are part of the bread-and-butter of the
audiologist business.
</P>
<P>
   This story took place around 1965 at the Municipal Cafeteria on
Canal Street, between Centre and Lafayette streets.
</P>
<P>
   It was one of those cafeterias (a few of them are still around)
where you passed through a turnstile, and in the process picked up
a ticket. As you removed the ticket from the machine, a loud
``bong'' sounded. The tickets were punched by the servers behind
the counters as you selected your meal. There were numeric
increments imprinted starting with 5 cents and progressing to a
dollar, $2, $3, $4, $5 and maybe $10.
</P>
<P>
   One day I was at the coffee and dessert counter, which was
served by an orange-haired, gum-chewing waitress. She was pouring
coffee, pushing Danish across the counter, punching tickets and
shouting, ``Next.'' The four-step progression had a musicality
about it. We crowded around this minor deity, who was elevated by a
behind-the-counter platform, raised our tickets and gave our
orders.
</P>
<P>
   A small man in our midst elbowed his way into visibility and
tried to get her attention. ``Lady, I want a cup of coffee,'' he
called out. Without a word, she continued what she was doing.
``Lady, I want a cup of coffee,'' he said again. She continued to
ignore him. Still louder, there was another ``Lady, I want a cup of
coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   At that point she leaned forward and and in a voice of great
condescension responded, ``Tell me, mister, what are you going to
do with three cups of coffee?'' The rest of us were almost as
delighted with the riposte as she was.

   &UR; Finding a Fort: the Basics &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Archeologists seeking the elusive remains of Fort Clatsop, the
winter quarters of the Lewis and Clark expedition in 1805-06, are
getting down to basics: They are looking for the camp's privies.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the National Park Service, the Museum of the
Rockies and the University of Washington are analyzing levels of
mercury in the soil at the site, near Astoria on the Oregon coast.
Mercury was a common Army treatment for syphilis; Meriwether Lewis
dispensed it in large doses to the men of the Corps of Discovery,
who contracted the disease from Indian women.
</P>
<P>
   High levels of the metal in specific soil samples would indicate
the site of a privy. ``With 33 men there for 106 days, we should be
able to find some high concentrations of mercury,'' said Cindy
Orlando, superintendent of the Fort Clatsop National Memorial.
</P>
<P>
   Because Army regulations at the time stipulated that privies be
located certain distances from encampments, finding signs of one
would make it easier to locate the 50-foot-by-50-foot fort. Only a
few artifacts, including a lead ball and a brass bead, have been
uncovered at the site.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Lead Levels in Ancient Ages &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Lead, not mercury, is of interest to scientists from four
European universities who have studied levels of the metal in an
ancient peat bog in Switzerland's Jura Mountains. Their results,
reported in Science magazine, show that the increase in atmospheric
lead levels because of human activity is not just a modern
phenomenon; it began 6,000 years ago, probably when early Europeans
began to clear land for agriculture, raising lead-laden dust from
the soil.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists analyzed lead levels in the layers of peat over
14,000 years. (The surface of a peat bog is isolated from ground
water; anything that settles on it as it grows is assumed to come
from the atmosphere.)
</P>
<P>
   The first 8,000 years provided a base level of natural lead
emissions with which to compare rising levels because of human
activity. In addition to the increases that began 6,000 years ago,
the researchers recorded fluctuations that coincided with events
like the flourishing of the Roman Empire and the beginnings of the
Industrial Revolution. They also found that lead levels appear to
be decreasing now, probably because of the removal of lead from
gasoline and other steps to reduce pollution.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Raising Dust on Mars Moon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   On the Martian moon Phobos, dust has been kicked up for
millions, not thousands, of years. In fact, researchers with NASA's
Mars Global Surveyor project say that the surface of the tiny moon
is covered in a hip-deep layer of the stuff, formed by long-term
bombardment by meteorites.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists have studied new close-up photos and temperature
measurements that show the surface rapidly loses heat as it goes
from day to night. Because Phobos does not have an atmosphere, such
a rapid heat loss can be explained if the surface is covered with a
three-foot layer of dust.
</P>
<P>
   The meteorites, the scientists suggest, have acted like a kind
of celestial Cuisinart, grinding the crust of the potato-shaped
moon into a fine powder.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Getting the Foe's Picture &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from Rockefeller University and the National
Institute of Child Health and Human Development have determined the
three-dimensional structure of an enzyme that makes some bacteria
resistant to a certain family of antibiotics. The enzyme catalyzes
the transfer of a molecular fragment, called an acetyl group, from
a donor molecule to the antibiotic, rendering it ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   Using X-ray crystallography, the researchers found that the
enzyme resembles a cupped hand wrapped around a cylinder. The
antibiotic binds to the cavity created by the ``hand,'' the donor
molecule binds elsewhere on the enzyme, and the transfer is made.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists can now try to design a drug that would, like the
winner in a game of musical chairs, bind in the cavity in place of
the antibiotic, thwarting the enzyme.

 By SUSAN GILBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Manhattan woman was in the first trimester of
pregnancy with her first child when she decided how she wanted the
baby delivered. She had read about childbirth in pregnancy books,
heard war stories from friends and relatives and feared that she
could not endure whatever labor pain she might have before the
epidural kicked in.
</P>
<P>
   She told her doctor that when her pregnancy was full term, she
wanted a Caesarean section.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spent a long time counseling her,'' said Dr. Andrei
Rebarber, her obstetrician at New York University Medical Center.
He told her that she had a greater chance for complications,
including hemorrhage, infection and death, from a Caesarean section
than from vaginal delivery. ``I told her I won't do a Caesarean
section without a medical indication. I feel that it's unethical.''
</P>
<P>
   But the woman, 46, a credit manager who spoke on the condition
that her name not be published, saw the situation differently. ``I
was surprised it wasn't my choice,'' she said. ``It's my body.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that she was willing to pay the extra cost of a
surgical delivery if her insurance company did not cover it. Now
five months pregnant, the woman has been trying to decide once and
for all whether to stay with Rebarber, whom she respects, or switch
to a doctor who will honor her choice.
</P>
<P>
   Needless to say, this woman's request is unusual. For years,
pregnant women's choice has been synonymous with the most natural
childbirth possible. And it has been a consensus in the medical
community that many Caesareans are unnecessary, with the rate at
about 21 percent of all births in this country, down slightly from
a record high of nearly 25 percent in 1988 and far higher than the
5 percent of 1965.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals and medical groups pressure doctors to avoid doing
Caesareans unless there is medical justification, like failure of
labor to progress or signs of distress to the fetus. The Department
of Health and Human Services has the goal of lowering the rate to
15 percent by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But the pendulum is beginning to swing, slightly, in the other
direction. Though no figures exist for elective Caesareans, some
doctors say that more women are asking for C-sections, even when
they are not necessary. And doctors are sharply divided on how to
respond.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent reports that question the safety of vaginal
deliveries in certain circumstances are driving this turnaround.
For example, in May, the Food and Drug Administration issued a
public health advisory on vacuum-assisted delivery devices, tools
that are sometimes used for difficult vaginal births.
</P>
<P>
   Each year for the last four years in the United States,
according to the advisory, five newborns have died or been
seriously injured after delivery with these devices.
</P>
<P>
   Another report concerned the safety of vaginal delivery for
women who previously had a Caesarean. Though doctors have
encouraged such women to try to deliver vaginally, a large Canadian
study published two years ago found that the chance of major
complications to the mother were greater than previously shown:
nearly twice as great as from a Caesarean section that was
scheduled before labor. Major complications included ruptured
uterus, which can be fatal.
</P>
<P>
   In general, childbirth is considered extremely safe for both
mother and child. Still, the findings on vaginal deliveries have
left some doctors questioning whether the Caesarean section rate
really is too high and left some women wondering whether it is
worth the pain and uncertainty of going through labor when
scheduled surgery is so convenient.
</P>
<P>
   ``The assumption that our C-section rate is too high is based on
zero data,'' said Dr. Charles Lockwood, an obstetrician at New York
University Medical Center and a member of the committee of
obstetrical practice of the American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists. Lowering the C-section rate to 15 percent, he said,
``may be dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   In England, there has been a marked increase in the number of
women asking for Caesareans when they are not medically necessary,
according to two commentaries published in the British Medical
Journal last month.
</P>
<P>
   The authors offered several reasons: medical advances like local
anesthesia that have made Caesarean sections safer, and evidence
that long, difficult vaginal deliveries can cause ``substantial
morbidity,'' like stress incontinence and other pelvic damage to
the mother, and cerebral palsy or even death to the baby.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are at a turning point in obstetric thinking,'' said Dr.

 NEW YORK: in Manchester.

<P>
   In the last year at Diana Princess of Wales Hospital in Grimsby,
``we've had 10 requests for Caesarean sections at our hospital,
half for no medical reason,'' said Dr. Ibrahim I. Bolaji, an author
of the other commentary and an obstetrician and gynecologist at the
hospital. ``For one woman, convenience was the reason. Her husband
works with the service and she wanted to schedule her delivery
before he had to leave the country. Two other patients didn't want
to go through labor pain, and one wanted a C-section because one of
her relations had a problem with normal labor.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolaji said that each request was granted. He said that some
doctors were willing to do elective Caesarean sections to avoid
malpractice lawsuits in the event that something goes wrong in a
vaginal birth, long a concern among obstetricians. ``Doctors have
little to gain and a lot to lose by not doing a Caesarean,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But fear of litigation is not the only factor. The commentaries
cited a survey published last year in which 31 percent of female
obstetricians in London said that they would choose a Caesarean for
themselves in an uncomplicated pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The main reason given was fear of damage to the pelvic organs
that could result from a vaginal delivery. Doctors say that a small
percentage of women who give birth vaginally suffer long-term
pelvic damage, like urinary incontinence and loss of muscle tone in
the vagina that can interfere with sexual satisfaction. Such
complications are most common after several vaginal deliveries.
</P>
<P>
   A number of American doctors criticized the British commentaries
for playing down the risks of Caesarean sections. ``I'm astonished
that any woman would want to have a Caesarean unless there's a
problem with the pregnancy or the labor,'' said Dr. Vicki L.
Seltzer, past president of the American College of Obstetricians
and Gynecologists and chairwoman of obstetrics and gynecology at
Long Island Jewish Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   It is unclear whether Caesarean section is safer for the baby in
an uncomplicated pregnancy and whether it is safer than using a
vacuum extraction for some difficult deliveries, Lockwood said.
``That's a hot area of debate,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians like Dr. Michael Brodman, vice chairman of obstetrics
and gynecology at Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York, have
received more requests for C-sections in the last few years but not
in the numbers reported in Britain. ``My sense in the community
that you're a better mother if you deliver vaginally isn't holding
water anymore,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Jennie A. Freiman, a gynecologist on the Upper East Side,
was so convinced that her two children would be better off with a
Caesarean delivery that she scheduled one for each of them. ``The
minute I found out I was pregnant, I told my obstetrician I wanted
a Caesarean section,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors are divided in how they handle a request for an
unnecessary Caesarean. Lockwood and Rebarber will not perform one
on a woman with an uncomplicated first pregnancy but will consider
doing it if she had a prior vaginal delivery that was harmful or
extremely difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Others, like Dr. William Ledger, chairman of obstetrics and
gynecology at New York Presbyterian Hospital, Cornell campus, will
perform Caesareans on first-time mothers with no medical need, but
only after trying to change their minds. All doctors emphasized the
need to tell patients the risks involved.
</P>
<P>
   As for the pregnant credit manager, her husband and her friends
have been trying to talk her out of having an elective Caesarean
section, arguing that it is not worth switching doctors and risking
medical complications. She has resolved to conquer her fear of
labor, for now. But she says that her desire for a Caesarean is so
strong that she expects to change her mind many times in the next
four months.

POTASSIUM-RICH DIET LOWERS STROKE RISK IN STUDY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JOHN O'NEIL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A study that tracked nearly 44,000 men over eight years has
found that those whose diets included large amounts of potassium
had one-third fewer strokes than those whose diets did not. The
benefits appeared to be greatest for men with high blood pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The study, published Tuesday in Circulation, the journal of the
American Heart Association, also found that the rate of strokes was
lower for men who consumed higher levels of magnesium and cereal
fiber.
</P>
<P>
   Potassium-rich foods include bananas, tomatoes, spinach and
other fruits and vegetables, explained the study's leader, Dr.
Alberto Ascherio of the Harvard School of Public Health, who
conceded that its recommendations may sound familiar.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some ways this could seem just the old story _ eat your
fruits and vegetables,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``But
stroke is such a horrible disease that we hope these figures
provide extra incentive for people to change their diets,
especially those with high blood pressure.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers have long known that potassium can reduce blood
pressure, and some small studies had suggested that increasing its
consumption could help prevent strokes. The current study tapped
into research begun in 1986, the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study, to see if the preventive effect could be demonstrated in a
large group over time.
</P>
<P>
   The major finding was that men in the top 20 percent for
potassium consumption _ eating an average of nine potassium-rich
servings a day _ had 38 percent fewer strokes than those in the
bottom 20 percent, who consumed less than four.
</P>
<P>
   Men without high blood pressure who had high intakes of
magnesium _ a mineral found in almost all foods, but in greater
amounts in fruits, vegetables and fish _ had a 30 percent lower
risk of stroke. Those who consumed high amounts of cereal fiber had
a 40 percent lower risk than those who did not.
</P>
<P>
   The differences were even more striking for men with high blood
pressure, a risk factor for stroke. Those taking potassium
supplements of one gram a day had a 60 percent lower risk of stroke
than men with high blood pressure who were not taking the
supplements.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ascherio cautioned against the general use of potassium
supplements, which are often prescribed to patients whose potassium
levels are lowered by hypertension medication. Too much potassium
can be harmful, especially to those with kidney problems. ``Two
tomatoes and one serving of spinach provide about 1 gram of
potassium,'' he said. ``You can't overdo with fruit.''

SCIENCE SQUINTS AT A FUTURE FOGGED BY CHAOTIC UNCERTAINTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.H., Calif., Mo., N.J.)   (af)  
 By MALCOLM W. BROWNE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Back during China's Shang dynasty, around 3,500 years ago, sages
foretold the future by casting oracle bones _ the clairvoyant
equivalent of crap shooting.
</P>
<P>
   Things have changed somewhat since then, even though predictions
are as much in demand as ever, and even though we still send plenty
of business to astrologers, tarot-card readers, numerologists,
phrenologists, necromancers and psychics of all stripes.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from the traditional soothsayers, we sometimes also heed
forecasts based on observations, scientific synthesis and
reasoning.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific sages depend not on tea leaves or the positions of
planets but on tools like mathematical modeling, statistical
analysis, complexity theory, celestial mechanics, geology,
economics and epidemiology. Needless to say, scientists discount
the naive paradigms of fortune tellers, ancient and modern.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, rational approaches to prediction also fail all too often,
and it may be that there are some phenomena for which predictions
will remain forever out of reach.
</P>
<P>
   As the stock market lurches between the tugs of bulls and bears,
financial analysts armed with statistics and the latest marketing
theories throw up their hands in despair when asked to guess what
will happen from one day to the next.
</P>
<P>
   Picnic planners know better than to rely on short-term weather
forecasts, and meteorologists offer little hope that truly accurate
weather predictions for specific places and times will ever be
possible.
</P>
<P>
   Relief agencies get little useful help from experts as they try
to brace for disasters that might, with equal likelihood, occur
tomorrow or a thousand years from now. Understanding the mechanisms
of events like earthquakes and volcanoes offers little help in
predicting precisely when they will occur.
</P>
<P>
   Geologists have a pretty good idea that earthquakes are caused
by the movement of tectonic plates, yet the art of earthquake
forecasting remains notoriously imprecise.
</P>
<P>
   The largest earthquake in four years _ an 8.2-magnitude tremor
centered under the ocean between Australia and Antarctica _ caught
seismologists completely off guard when it shook the sea floor last
March 25, and geologists are still puzzled by the quake; it did not
occur at the junction of tectonic plates where most quakes occur,
but struck within a single plate.
</P>
<P>
   Future seismic surprises, including those causing catastrophic
loss of life, seem inevitable.
</P>
<P>
   The tsunami that roared over Papua New Guinea on July 17,
killing more than 2,000 people, caught everyone by surprise.
Experts excused their failure to warn the population on the ground
that a giant tsunami wave materializes only when a scarcely
noticeable wave spawned by an earthquake or some other event far
out at sea reaches shallow coastal water. By then it is almost on
top of some hapless coast line, leaving no time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   There have been recent reminders that even in principle, some
things are impossible to predict.
</P>
<P>
   Among the puzzles that have perplexed mathematicians and
physicists at least since the time of Isaac Newton in the 17th
century is the ``N-body problem'' (sometimes called the ``Many-body
problem'').
</P>
<P>
   One of Newton's monumental discoveries was that any two objects
attract each other with a force proportional to their masses and
inversely proportional to the square of their distance apart. But
when three or more objects _ the Sun, the Earth and the Moon, for
example _ are interacting gravitationally, exact solutions of the
equations describing their motions generally remain beyond reach.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, since Newton's day, some very good approximate
solutions of N-body equations have been devised, and such solutions
have allowed space scientists to send vehicles to the distant
reaches of the solar system with astounding precision.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Dr. Gregory R. Buck of Saint Anselm College, in
Manchester, N.H., disclosed a new class of approximate N-body
solutions based on the analogy of a closed loop of beads, in which
the beads, evenly spaced, chase each other around the curves and
tangles of the loop.
</P>
<P>
   The system may help to work out the interactions of particles
within a plasma, Buck suggested.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the approximations now known exactly solve Newton's
equations, and this means that the motions of asteroids and comets
can be predicted only up to a certain point in the distant future.
Beyond that, forecasting an impact by one of these objects on the
earth may be intrinsically impossible.
</P>
<P>
   A hit or miss may depend so sensitively on the minuscule
``initial conditions'' of all the objects involved that precise
calculation becomes impossible. This is a property of a large class
of systems scientists describe as chaotic.
</P>
<P>
   Long-term foreknowledge of the hit or miss _ a question of life
or death for millions _ is ruled out by the chaos inherent in the
N-body system.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists have yet to come to terms with chaos in all its
manifestations. Dr. Steven Weinberg, winner of a Nobel prize in
physics, once said he considered an understanding of chaotic
turbulence in fluids as the single most intractable problem in
physics. Until scientists reach a deeper understanding of
turbulence, many physicists believe, the dynamics of climate
change, the behavior of galaxies and many other phenomena can never
be fully penetrated.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Chaos can also prevent reliable predictions of group decisions,
including those that investors make. Group decisions by investors
can cause chaotic price fluctuations of commodities that are
intrinsically unpredictable, it seems.
</P>
<P>
   In a report published Aug. 24 in the journal Physical Review
Letters, Dr. David A. Meyer of the University of California at San
Diego and Dr. Thad A. Brown of the University of Missouri presented
formal proof that collective decisions can be chaotic, even when
the views of all participants are known and a standard voting rule
is strictly applied.
</P>
<P>
   When a group of decision-makers must choose between three or
more options by comparing two of them at a time, the collective
outcome often depends on the order in which the choices are
presented. The outcome can cycle chaotically, the mathematicians
found. Even nonhuman decision-makers _ the computers that buy and
sell commodities according to programmed rules, for example _ are
subject to chaotic uncertainty, a situation in which prediction
becomes impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Frustrated by the complex and chaotic behavior of the real
world, some theorists have invented forecasting techniques based on
little more than pure mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, Rene Thom, a French mathematician, developed an
approach called Catastrophe Theory, which, for a time, enjoyed a
considerable vogue among physicists, biologists and even
sociologists. The theory is an application of topology, a field of
mathematics that deals with the shapes of surfaces.
</P>
<P>
   Thom's theory holds that many sequences of events can be
represented as smooth trajectories along a saddle-shaped surface,
at one point of which an abrupt discontinuity, or ``catastrophe
cusp,'' shunts them off to one side of the saddle or the other.
</P>
<P>
   Thom and his followers proposed that mathematical models based
on catastrophe cusps could be used to predict the reproduction of
bacteria, the behavior of the stock market, heart attacks,
biological evolution and the outbreak of war, among many other
things.
</P>
<P>
   To some, Thom's theory seemed to offer an explanation of almost
everything, but many others condemned it as useless. Today,
Catastrophe Theory is all but forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   Predicting life spans in the absence of detailed knowledge has
long interested scientists as well as insurance statisticians. A
forecast of life expectancy based on the average age at death of a
person's four grandparents is a simple example of statistical
forecasting. But a much more daring approach was devised a few
years ago by Dr. J.Richard Gott III, a professor of astrophysics at
Princeton University.
</P>
<P>
   Gott's scheme is based on the ``Copernican principle,'' which
assumes that the odds are overwhelmingly against any particular
place or time being ``special.'' From this, Gott reasoned that the
mere knowledge of how long something (or someone) has been around
is sufficient to estimate how much longer it could last.
</P>
<P>
   Based on this system, and the assumption that Homo sapiens
appeared on earth about 200,000 years ago, Gott calculated that
intelligent human beings are 95-percent certain to survive a
minimum of 5,128 years more, and a maximum of 7.8 million years
more.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who contend that predictions like these are so
vague that they are scarcely more useful than the prophecies of the
Delphic oracle in ancient Greece, which was consulted by Socrates,
Oedipus and other luminaries of the day. The oracle (operated by a
concealed priest or priestess) was so ambiguous it could nearly
never be proved wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Scientists will never be able to answer all our questions about
future events or to satisfy a deep-seated human yearning to foresee
what's coming at us. Some scientific efforts at prediction will
always be defeated by the nature of Nature.
</P>
<P>
   Mystic oracles have never shed light on future events either,
but even 1,398 years after Socrates' suicide, legions of people
continue to visit palmists, astrologists and psychics. It's human
to prefer something to nothing at all.

PERSONAL HEALTH: THE DANGERS OF DIETARY SUPPLEMENTS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By JANE E. BRODY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Growing numbers of Americans are stepping daily into a potential
minefield of substances loosely referred to as dietary supplements,
many of which have little or nothing to do with the components of
foods people normally consume. And increasingly these pill poppers
are getting into trouble, suffering toxic reactions to deliberate
or accidental components of these products or sacrificing the
chance to be helped by conventional medicine.
</P>
<P>
   Last week in six reports published in The New England Journal of
Medicine, physicians described such reactions as lead poisoning,
impotence, blood clots, abnormal heart rhythms, nausea, vomiting,
diarrhea and disorientation from exposure to powerful drugs or
toxic contaminants in products deemed to be ``all natural''
alternatives to established therapies. The reports are a reminder
that consumers who wander recklessly into the world of herbs and
other dietary supplements must proceed at their own risk because no
regulatory agency currently has the authority to assess the safety,
purity or effectiveness of these products before they can be sold
to the public.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the public may be, in effect, serving as guinea pigs
in experiments that don't always have happy endings. While the
majority of supplement manufacturers are scrupulous and use
production techniques that approach pharmaceutical standards,
others are less than careful and some are downright cheats, filling
capsules with impure substances and sometimes with little or none
of the ingredients listed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, dietary supplements of all kinds were treated
as food additives under the direct jurisdiction of the Food and
Drug Administration. Producers had to prove they were safe before
they could be sold, a requirement that doubtless kept hundreds of
products off the shelves. Producers also could not claim any health
benefits that were not scientifically established to the
satisfaction of the FDA.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, under a deluge of consumer pressure instigated by
the supplement industry, Congress changed the rules. Dietary
supplements _ broadly defined to include herbs, amino acids,
botanical extracts, quasi-vitamins as well as real vitamins and
minerals _ could be sold without any prior approval of the agency,
which had been established decades earlier to safeguard the health
of Americans against the onslaught of unethical or careless food
and drug producers.
</P>
<P>
   Now, under the new law entitled the Dietary Supplement Health
and Education Act, it is up to the FDA to take products off the
market only after they have proved dangerous to people taking them.
Only when a new ingredient is introduced is the company obliged to
provide the drug agency with documentation of its presumed safety.
Furthermore, while companies cannot make claims of a product's
ability to treat or prevent disease, they can make general
function, wellness and nutritional support statements on package
labels that imply health benefits, even though such benefits may
not be well established by properly designed scientific
experiments.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, an herb called saw palmetto can be said to promote
prostate health and ginkgo to enhance memory. And while people have
long used the herb feverfew to help with migraine headaches,
producers can only say it helps with brain function. But not every
consumer organization supported the new law. For example, the
Washington-based Center for Science in the Public Interest, a
nonprofit consumer advocacy group, called the bill a ``ticking time
bomb'' that would force consumers to ``play Russian roulette when
they take a supplement.''
</P>
<P>
   The center pointed out that royal jelly, a dietary supplement
derived from honey bees, had already been linked to the death of an
11-year-old girl with asthma and had caused serious asthmatic
attacks in nine other people. In the newly published reports,
researchers described PC-SPES, an unregulated mixture of herbs with
potent estrogen-like activity, that caused serious side effects in
patients with prostate cancer. In another report, two previously
healthy young women were said to have suffered irregular heart
rhythms, lethargy, persistent nausea and severe vomiting after
taking a botanical dietary supplement that was contaminated with
digitalis, a drug that could provoke fatal heart rhythms when
inappropriately used.
</P>
<P>
   Another report told of two children with cancer whose parents
rejected established chemotherapy for dietary supplements _ a
botanical said to boost immunity in one case and shark cartilage (a
supplement popularized by the 1992 book ``Sharks Don't Get
Cancer'') in the other. One child died in a few months, the other
developed a more advanced cancer requiring more potent therapy. In
still another report, an analysis of 260 Asian patent medicines
sold in California revealed that 32 percent contained a drug not
listed on the label or contaminants like lead, arsenic and mercury.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lori Love and colleagues at the FDA pointed out in the
journal that ``there are currently no federal regulations that
establish specific criteria for purity, identification and
manufacturing procedures of dietary supplements.'' In other words,
producers can put in just about anything they want, including no
active ingredient at all, and there is no guarantee that what it
says on the label is what is in the bottle. An analysis of ginseng
products, for example, revealed up to a 10-fold difference in the
amount of the active ingredient, even though all were labeled as
containing the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   Nor is the producer required to maintain pharmaceutical
standards in making the product, which could end up _ and some have
ended up _ with all manner of contaminants. In 1990, 36 people died
and at least 1,500 became seriously ill after taking a popular
supplement, L-tryptophan, which was subsequently found to contain
63 contaminants and pulled from the market.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, the drug agency researchers noted, ``there are no
requirements for mandatory reporting to the FDA of adverse events
by the manufacturer or distributor of these products,'' which means
it is up to the agency and physicians to pick them up. This brings
up a third problem: Many, perhaps most, people who take
over-the-counter dietary supplements and other alternative remedies
never report that fact to their physicians. Even when patients
suffer untoward effects, they may be too embarrassed to tell their
doctors what they had been taking. As a result, doctors sometimes
mistakenly attribute supplement-caused symptoms to the illness or
the treatment they prescribed, which can result in unwarranted and
hazardous changes in the patient's medical care.
</P>
<P>
   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Marcia Angell and Dr. Jerome
Kassirer pointed out that consumers mistakenly assume that dietary
supplements are safer than drugs even though their producers often
assert that they are as or more powerful than conventional
medicines. But there is no free lunch. If a substance contains
biologically active ingredients, it is bound to have other effects
that may be undesirable, even dangerous. The editors called for
rigorous testing of all products, stating, ``It is time for the
scientific community to stop giving alternative medicine a free
ride.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Dangerous Herbs &LR;
</P>
<P>
   The September issue of the magazine New Choices: Living Even
Better After 50 cautions against taking five herbal remedies that
the editors listed as among those that ``can trigger serious side
effects or toxic reactions.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the herbs:
</P>
<P>
   CHAPARRAL _ Also called creosote bush, it may cause acute
nonviral hepatitis (rapidly developing liver damage) that is
sometimes irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   COMFREY _ Has been linked to obstruction of blood flow from the
liver, possibly causing irreversible scarring of the liver.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANDER _ Is mixed with other herbs to treat obesity. In
France it has been linked to at least 27 cases of acute nonviral
hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   LOBELIA _ In low doses, can result in respiratory depression,
rapid heart rate and coma.
</P>
<P>
   YOHIMBE _ Is found in body-building products, which the Food and
Drug Administration has associated with kidney failure, seizures
and death.

EXPERTS SAY COPYRIGHT LAWSUIT COULD SET HARMFUL PRECEDENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SETH ROSENFELD  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a lawsuit that experts say threatens the
free-wheeling nature of the World Wide Web, a photographer claims
JC Penney Co. Inc. should be held liable because its Web site was
one of three ``links'' that ultimately led to an unauthorized
display of his photo of movie star Elizabeth Taylor.
</P>
<P>
   Celebrity photographer Gary Bernstein's complaint contends the
department store, which advertises Taylor's ``Passion'' perfume on
its Web site, violated his copyright even though its own site did
not show his photograph.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit appears to be the first to claim a copyright
violation resulted from multiple linking, the main way of moving
about the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit reflects the convergence of technology, law and
public policy on the Web. It pits an artist's rights to prohibit
unauthorized use of his work against the Web's ability to link
sites virtually anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to define what the (copyright) protection will be
on the new medium,'' said Patrick Grannan, Bernstein's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Several experts said the lawsuit, if successful, could threaten
the essence of the Web, which relies on links to connect millions
of pages stored in separate computers around the world. Viewers
click on links, the underlined or colored words or icons on Web
pages, to move from one site to another, giving the Web its great
informational power.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the suit were upheld, it would be very bad for content on
the Web,'' said Hal Varian, dean of the School of Information
Management at the University of California at Berkeley. ``It would
have a chilling effect on links. The valuable thing about links is,
you point to contradictory material, or supporting material ... You
can build on what's been done before.''
</P>
<P>
   Shari Steele, a lawyer for the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a
San Francisco-based nonprofit group that defends civil liberties on
the Internet, agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole concept of surfing the Web is that you can go to one
site and click and go to another,'' she said. If Web operators are
liable for the content of sites they don't control, she said,
``they would be loath to link to it in the first place, and that
would completely destroy the way the Web works.''
</P>
<P>
   Copyright law prohibits copying or distributing someone else's
photographs, words or other creative works without permission.
People who infringe on copyrighted material may be ordered to stop
and to pay damages.
</P>
<P>
   According to the lawsuit, JC Penney and Elizabeth Arden Co., the
maker of Passion, in November 1997 promoted the perfume with an
on-line chat on America Online with Taylor, the perfume's
spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   The chat site was linked to an Elizabeth Taylor-Passion perfume
page at a separate Web site run by JC Penney. On this page, viewers
could click on a biography link that took them to another Web site
run by Internet Movie Database Ltd., which featured information on
the movie star.
</P>
<P>
   Once there, they could click on another link that took them to a
Web site run by the Swedish University Network, which included two
photos of Taylor that had been taken by Bernstein. One _ the ``Pink
Lady'' _ showed Taylor in a pink outfit. Another _ ``the lavender
image'' _ showed her in a floral print dress.
</P>
<P>
   Bernstein filed the lawsuit in April, claiming that he licensed
the Pink Lady to Elizabeth Arden Co. to promote the perfume for a
limited period that expired several years ago. The lavender image
appeared on the cover of a photography magazine in 1986 and also
was copyrighted, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit said JC Penney, Arden and Internet Movie Database
all violated Bernstein's copyright because _ through the links _
they reproduced or distributed the images on the Internet without
his permission.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, anyone in the United States who found the photos
through JC Penney's Web site and downloaded them also infringed on
the copyright, the lawsuit said.
</P>
<P>
   In response, Arden moved to dismiss the case, saying Arden had
no control over JC Penney's Web site and, even if it did, was not
responsible for photos shown on a site three links away in Sweden.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plaintiff's untenable theory of infringement would bring
traffic on the Information Highway to a stand-still,'' a lawyer for
Arden said in a court brief.

`CIVIL WAR' OVERCOMES OBSTACLES 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVERETT EVANS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ ``The Civil War'' is composer Frank Wildhorn's big
gamble _ and, to a large extent, it pays off in the world premiere
unveiled at the Alley Theater in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   After scoring popular successes with ``Jekyll &AMP; Hyde'' and ``The
Scarlet Pimpernel'' (despite scant critical approval), Wildhorn
turns to a subject that is inherently more substantial and
prestigious. ``The Civil War'' would seem ready-made, an
exploration of that vast scar at the heart of America's history.
Not a traditional musical but a theatrical concert, it consists of
songs (and a few spoken interludes) based on letters, diaries and
other documents, assembled to express the emotional landscape of
the time.
</P>
<P>
   The risks are built-in, too.
</P>
<P>
   Wildhorn likes to keep a contemporary pop dimension in his
theater scores, but when that style asserts itself here, it
inevitably feels at odds with the somber passion of his subject.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Wildhorn, lyricist Jack Murphy and
co-author/production supervisor Gregory Boyd have set themselves a
difficult challenge in their chosen format. As a bookless show,
essentially a revue of individual vignettes, ``The Civil War,''
which runs through Oct. 11, cannot summon the cumulative impact of
a traditional musical. Songs that come out of nowhere, however
strong their emotion, do not wield the same dramatic clout as those
that grow out of sustained character and narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Those challenges notwithstanding, ``The Civil War'' offers so
much that is first-rate and undeniably heart-tugging that it
warrants a salute.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important in a show that is virtually all sung, the
voices are all terrific. This company could hold its own against
just about any current Broadway cast _ and Wildhorn provides a lot
of strong material that showcases them effectively.
</P>
<P>
   The show gets rolling with ``By the Sword/Sons of Dixie,'' a
lusty double chorale for Union and Confederate soldiers heeding the
call to arms in high spirit _ displaying the strong choral
arranging that is one of the show's assets.
</P>
<P>
   Matt Bogart shines in ``Tell My Father,'' a deftly understated
soliloquy of a dying soldier. Michael Lanning is forceful
throughout as a Union captain, especially in his homesick lament
``Northbound Train.'' Gene Miller, as a Confederate captain, sings
an elegy to the pre-war South in ``Virginia,'' its sturdy lyrics
and appealing melody enhanced by Miller's supple, powerful
rendition.
</P>
<P>
   As abolitionist Frederick Douglass, Keith Byron Kirk leads the
yearning ``Freedom's Child'' _ more potent in its quiet opening
than in the later revved-up passages.
</P>
<P>
   Michel Bell does a marvelous job with the aching ``Father, How
Long?'', Wildhorn's melody taking full advantage of Bell's
thundering low notes. Bell and Cheryl Freeman create one of the
show's emotional highlights in ``If Prayin' Were Horses,'' the song
of husband and wife slaves being parted on the auction block.
Lawrence Clayton proves a vocal powerhouse leading a dynamic
ensemble performance of the gospel-tinged ``River Jordan,'' the
first act finale.
</P>
<P>
   David Lutkin brings a plaintive simplicity to the folklike
``I'll Never Pass This Way Again,'' a Confederate soldier's musing
on the evanescence of life. Beth Leavel's dignity and controlled
pathos are ideal for ``Five Boys,'' in which a mother contemplates
the news that all five of her sons have died in battle.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Sarah,'' the score's most traditional romantic ballad,
Gilles Chiasson gives a tender rendition of a lovesick soldier's
letter to his wife. Irene Molloy answers in superb voice with the
moving ``The Honor of Your Name,'' expressing her resolve to carry
on after learning of her husband's death.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Eder's beautiful voice enhances the distinction of ``I
Never Knew His Name,'' perhaps the score's most original melody,
the song of a nurse caring for a dying soldier. Eder doubles as a
sort of angel of the battlefield, leading fallen soldiers away with
a gentle lullabylike theme. Another highlight in this vein is
``Candle in the Window,'' beautifully sung by Capathia Jenkins as a
citizen reflecting on the burdens of President Lincoln; a slightly
more oblique, less on-the-nose number, this one proves a welcome
respite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Civil War'' allows Wildhorn to show more range than he has
previously. Much of the music is appealing, especially the ballads
in a kind of timeless, folklike vein. It is when Wildhorn shifts
gears to an up-tempo pop vein that the songs fall short of the
gravity and grandeur the theme demands.
</P>
<P>
   Several ensembles for groups of soldiers or slaves (``Judgment
Day'', ``How Many Devils'') start promisingly with brooding, a
capella passages, but then rev up to a pop beat that seems
inappropriate. There also are a few misjudged numbers, like
``Greenback,'' in which snaky Jesse Lenat appears as a scalawag,
camp-following pimp flanked by his two harlots. Sure, the show
needs comic relief, but the number's tone is wrong, the comic point
not sharp enough for the needed payoff.
</P>
<P>
   Murphy's vernacular lyrics usually are neat, craftsmanly and to
the point. Fortunately, there are no outright clinkers or bad taste
howlers. But there are some passages in which the words and music
are merely ordinary.
</P>
<P>
   An (almost) all-sung show on such an important theme demands
eloquence and inspiration throughout. As the show stands, about
half of it comes close to that level. The challenge is to bring the
rest up to snuff.
</P>
<P>
   The collaborators have attempted to group the songs in
sequences, sometimes creating an interaction between numbers, as
when the doomed soldier's ``Sarah'' is answered by his widow's solo
about losing him. The team should build on this element. The more
they can suggest connections between the songs and the more they
can use recurring figures in the action, then the more their show
gains in dramatic impact.
</P>
<P>
   While ``The Civil War'' is essentially a song cycle or theater
concert, the Alley has mounted it as a full production. The
direction supplies about the right amount of movement to keep the
show from growing static. The musical staging is by George Faison,
the staging by Nick Corley and the production is supervised by
Boyd, so it's a bit difficult to determine just who did what.
</P>
<P>
   The groupings and tableaux are often effective, especially as
enhanced by Wendall K. Harrington's projections of period
photographs: a collage of portraits of soldiers; the text of
Lincoln's letter to Mrs. Bixby (the mother who lost all five sons);
a misty dawn on the battlefield at Gettysburg. Douglas Schmidt's
setting of stately columns and platforms creates a handsome and
functional playing space.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Wendland's costumes resourcefully incorporate suggestions
of the period without actually re-creating it. And Howell Binkley's
lighting is a powerful cue for the shifting moods of the
production.
</P>
<P>
   Karl Richardson's sound design makes certain everyone in the
house hears every note. But the singing is too heavily and
unnecessarily amplified _ so that the loud passages bludgeon the
listener. Especially in the relatively small (by musical theater
standards) Alley venue, these strong voices could do the job
without mechanical assistance, and it would be a pleasure to hear
them pure.
</P>
<P>
   Even as it stands in this first public viewing, ``The Civil
War'' is an ambitious piece whose strengths outweigh its
weaknesses. If theaters are going to create bookless shows,
something along these lines is far more interesting than a ``Smokey
Joe's Cafe'' or ``Forever Plaid'' assemblage of oldies. Given the
loose format, you can bet Wildhorn and company will make plenty of
improvements and substitutions before ``The Civil War'' makes its
Broadway bow next spring. &QL;

A BIG THUMBS UP TO THOSE WHO HELP 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The flight from Houston to Atlanta had landed right on schedule.
But because our arrival gate was occupied _ an all-too-familiar
predicament _ we were idling on the tarmac between terminals,
waiting until space cleared.
</P>
<P>
   My immediate reaction was irritation. How is it that mankind is
brilliant enough to build machines that fly so high and so fast,
yet we can't supply sufficient parking on the ground?
</P>
<P>
   And because of this absurdity, how many of us would miss our
tight flight connections?
</P>
<P>
   Then my gaze focused on the beehive of activity below, on scores
of carts and trucks scooting across the pavement and carrying
literally thousands of pieces of luggage.
</P>
<P>
   For a scant moment, my dismay intensified. My bags probably
wouldn't make the connection, either, I convinced myself. And by
the way: Are these the same guys who knocked a wheel off my new
suitcase the last time I traveled through Hartsfield International?
</P>
<P>
   But as time passed, I ceased bemoaning our temporary fate and
instead began marveling at the men and women driving these baggage
vehicles, working frantically to ensure that the possessions of
tens of thousands of passengers each day reach their appointed
destinations.
</P>
<P>
   The wonder isn't that an occasional bag is misdirected or
damaged; it's that these occurrences are so infrequent, especially
given the pace and scope of modern-day travel.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SILENT HELPERS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Amid all the hassles, it's easy to become frustrated. To
complain. And to overlook countless individuals whose efforts _
often in anonymity _ help make our trips less stressful. Safer.
More enjoyable.
</P>
<P>
   Consider the plight of security personnel at airports and other
public places. They go to work every day in a pressure-packed
environment. A dangerous environment, too, as we were reminded by
two tragic deaths at the U.S. Capitol this summer.
</P>
<P>
   With security measures tightened at airports in the aftermath of
recent terrorist bombings and subsequent threats, all travelers are
subject to inconveniences and delays. But these men and women are
there for our protection. And when a security guard takes five
minutes to inspect my computer or camera equipment, I'm not
aggravated; I'm comforted by his or her diligence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
KUDOS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's a tip of the cap, too, to other unsung heroes of travel:
</P>
<P>
   Park rangers and volunteers dedicated to preserving _ and
showing off _ our natural and historical wonders.
</P>
<P>
   Volunteers at tourist information centers and information booths
who relish introducing us to their hometown treasures _ out of a
sense of pride, not a desire for compensation.
</P>
<P>
   Tour-bus drivers. We deservedly reward tour guides. But the
driver who gets us safely to each destination too often goes
unthanked.
</P>
<P>
   Busboys on cruise ships and in restaurants. At sea, the busboy
gets half the gratuity traditionally offered a waiter and often
works twice as hard. At least we usually know his name; in
restaurants on land we're rarely introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Housekeepers in hotels. We trust them with our valued
possessions as we go sightseeing or attend business meetings, and
almost without exception they never let us down. But how often do
we ask their name? Or leave a thank-you tip?
</P>
<P>
   Individuals in airports and at other public venues who transport
travelers with disabilities and elderly or injured travelers on
carts and in wheelchairs. Some are airport or airline personnel;
others are volunteers. All provide an important service.
</P>
<P>
   Ticket and gate agents at airports and bus and train stations.
It's not their fault our flight or bus is delayed or canceled or
overbooked. But they sure are convenient targets for venting our
emotions, aren't they?
</P>
<P>
   I could go on and on: the gardener in a public park, the
naturalist at a zoo or aquarium, the museum guide, the theater
usher, the flight attendant.
</P>
<P>
   I made my connection in Atlanta. So did my luggage. I don't know
whom to thank. But he or she is appreciated. &QL;

HOLLY GETS SWEETER BY THE DAY AFTER SUGAR MAKER BUYS FOOD SERVICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NELSON ANTOSH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Imperial Holly announced Monday its second acquisition
within a week, agreeing to pay $120 million for a food service
company that will further diversify the sugar company into
high-margin business lines.
</P>
<P>
   The Sugar Land, Texas, company will pay $80 million in cash and
$40 million in common stock, plus assume $33.9 million in debt for
Diamond Crystal Specialty Foods, based in Wilmington, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   The company supplies nutritional mixes, drink mixes, sauces,
seasonings and desserts to businesses in the food service industry,
which includes hotels, restaurants, hospitals and schools.
</P>
<P>
   Should Imperial Holly decide to pay all cash, the purchase price
will be reduced to $115 million.
</P>
<P>
   President and Chief Executive James C. Kempner described the
acquisition as another step in Imperial Holly's strategy of
increasing its participation in the higher-margin, higher-growth
sectors of the sweetener market.
</P>
<P>
   The company is using its marketing and distribution prowess to
move into food segments allied with sweeteners, Kempner said.
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, Imperial Holly said it was acquiring Wholesome
Foods, a supplier of organic sugar based in Daytona Beach, Fla.
Wholesome's organic sweeteners are produced without herbicides or
insecticides and are sold through health food chains.
</P>
<P>
   The latest acquisition target, Diamond Crystal Specialty Foods,
produced sales of $125.9 million and earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization of $13.5 million, during the
fiscal year that ended March 31.
</P>
<P>
   Once the deal is completed, Diamond Crystal's operations will be
combined with those of Imperial Holly's Dixie Crystals food service
division, based in Savannah, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies are leaders in their segments of the food service
industry with complementary product lines, said Kempner. There are
substantial opportunities for revenue enhancement and cost
reduction in the combination, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Wilmington, Diamond Crystal has manufacturing
facilities in Moore, Okla.; Indianapolis; Boudurant, Iowa; and
Mitchellville, Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction remains subject to Imperial Holly getting
approval from regulators and certain waivers from its senior debt
holders.
</P>
<P>
   If Imperial Holly decides to pay with the cash-stock
combination, Diamond Crystal has the option of canceling if the
stock price averages below $8 per share during 10 days just prior
to the closing. The stock closed last Tuesday at 7 7/8, up 1/4 in
trading on the American Stock Exchange. &QL;

TAX CUT FOLLIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The first test of how far congressional Republicans
can take the legislative edge they gain from President Clinton's
diminished political stature will come this week when the House
takes up a GOP-sponsored tax cut that the president threatens to
veto.
</P>
<P>
   And the president may actually win this tussle.
</P>
<P>
   That outcome would be due to public understanding of the
dangerous and irresponsible nature of the Republican desire to eat
into the projected federal budget surplus for an unneeded
$80-billion tax cut. It does not send a signal that the president's
sagging fortunes can be rejuvenated.
</P>
<P>
   The president is right to oppose the tax cut on the grounds that
the surplus ought to be used to shore up the Social Security
system, which could run out of money after the massive baby boomer
generation has retired in about 30 years. And Congress would be
right to reject the tax cut.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly two-thirds of those surveyed by a recent Wall Street
Journal-NBC News poll said any budget surplus should be used to
protect Social Security's long-term solvency or reduce the
accumulated national debt, while just one-fourth say the surplus
should be used to lower taxes.
</P>
<P>
   The House Ways and Means Committee, in approving the tax-cut
package, argued that the tax breaks would erode only about 10
percent of the anticipated surplus and leave the rest for Social
Security. The president and the Democrats counter that Social
Security will need all the reserves it can get.
</P>
<P>
   They also see it as a fairness issue, because 98 percent of the
projected surplus is generated by Social Security payroll taxes in
the first place.
</P>
<P>
   The problem here is that the Republicans want to fritter away
part of a surplus that is not an automatic given; it could vanish
in some subsequent recessionary period. And they want to squander
it on a tax cut that is not essential either to bolster the economy
or correct a major tax inequity.
</P>
<P>
   The Congressional Budget Office estimates there will be a
$1.6-trillion surplus over the next 10 years, based upon an
optimistic economic assumption that the country will continue its
current prosperous growth. But even the CBO warns that if the shaky
world economy produces an American slowdown that becomes a
recession like that of 1990, the total projected surpluses would be
quickly wiped out and big deficits reappear.
</P>
<P>
   Although the CBO is obviously doing a lot of guessing here, its
next adjusted economic assessment is not due until January, after
the November election.
</P>
<P>
   Ways and Means Chairman Bill Archer, R-Texas, contends that the
tax cut is needed to correct an imbalance between income taxes
levied against single individuals and married couples, help
self-employed people pay for health insurance, slash the estate tax
and exclude up to $400 in dividend and interest income per tax
return.
</P>
<P>
   Archer also calls it a middle-class tax cut because it would
increase the standard deduction for married couples of all incomes
and ease some taxes on senior citizens, small business owners,
farmers and college students.
</P>
<P>
   But it really would help upper-income individuals _ a basic GOP
constituency but the very folks who need it the least. They are
more apt to have investment income that will now be taxed at a
lower rate.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed cut in estate taxes would immediately raise the
amount that passes to heirs tax-free from the present $600,000 to
$1 million. That will affect only the richest 2 percent of the
population and represent one-fourth of the entire cost of the tax
bill.
</P>
<P>
   The House is likely to approve this abominable giveaway because
it is difficult for Democrats as well as Republicans to vote
against tax cuts. But President Clinton reiterated his promise to
veto the bill twice last week, stiffening the spines of Democrats
worried that Clinton might cut some deal and leave them holding the
bag if they stand firm against it. And Democrats are confident they
have enough votes to prevent a later override.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the Senate is not going to rush to judgment on this
issue. This will not become law any time soon. Many Senate
Republicans as well as Democrats are nervous about dipping into a
surplus that could be essential to the future of Social Security
and may prove to be ephemeral anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional Republicans feel the president is so weakened they
have a good opportunity to push their agenda this fall. But the
public preoccupation with the president's sexual encounters
interferes with voters' attention to serious subjects like taxes
just as it drowns out his own efforts to change the subject.
</P>
<P>
   That's too bad, actually. The GOP is trying to pull a fast one
here, and ought to be held accountable by all future retirees who
will be dependent upon Social Security.

STARR REPORT LEAVES EDITORS WALKING ON A WIRE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By PAUL K. HARRAL 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I'm involved in a lengthy discussion with a frequent critic
about how much and what kind of information needs to be in the
newspaper from the Office of Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The reader argues _ correctly, I believe _ that this has the
potential to become a serious constitutional crisis and that
details, no matter how distasteful, are important.
</P>
<P>
   Balance that against discussions last week with readers angered
by the level of detail even in the highly edited version of the
Starr report that the Fort Worth Star-Telegram printed in its news
columns the day after its release.
</P>
<P>
   Some were supporters of President Clinton who didn't think the
report should have been printed. Others were deeply disturbed about
the detail and language in even that sanitized version.
</P>
<P>
   In this child-centric society, it's easy to use children as an
excuse to do or not do things, and you should be a little skeptical
when people toss around that ``good of the children'' phrase too
easily.
</P>
<P>
   But we at the Star-Telegram do take seriously the concept that
we are a newspaper for the whole family.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes we falter, of course, and push the limits of good
taste because we weren't thinking or didn't see the double entendre
or, in some cases, because we were being a little naughty and
trying to see how far we would push it.
</P>
<P>
   Readers are pretty good about calling our hand when that
happens, and we do listen. We don't always agree, but we pay
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Sex is an especially touchy issue. The local record for
sensitivity is held by a reader who thought a pile of potatoes
depicted in a grocery ad was pornographic. But there also are
periodic calls about department store ads.
</P>
<P>
   ``I been reading this paper for 40 years,'' one caller said last
week. ``The last few years, every time I turn to Page 2 you have a
woman there in her underwear. And you're trying to sit there and
read the paper with a half-page of a woman in her underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know you need to sell lots of ads, but put that on Page
Something Else,'' the reader said, ``because every time I turn to
Page 2, my wife says, `What are you looking at?' I say, `Well, I'm
looking at the paper. I can't help it if she's there in her
underwear.' We don't appreciate you putting them women in their
underwear (there).''
</P>
<P>
   Such complaints are relatively common, so you can imagine the
consternation that rippled through the editing ranks when Ken
Starr's report to the House of Representatives became available.
</P>
<P>
   People had been meeting throughout the day about what to do.
There were several factors involved. One was whether we could find
the press time to print the special section that would be required
for the Saturday or Sunday newspaper. Another was the cost. The
third _ and the most important _ was the issue of taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the most agonizing decision I've had to make,'' said
Kathy Vetter, one of the managing editors. ``Do we violate all of
our decency standards and publish the entire report, graphic detail
and all? Or do we edit the worst parts, an action that at best
could be condescending to our readers and at worst could leave them
without all the necessary information?''
</P>
<P>
   ``As journalists,'' said Vice President and Executive Editor Jim
Witt, ``our first inclination was to run the entire report and put
it inside every edition of the Star-Telegram as a public service _
the theory being that it was a historical document alleging crimes
by the president, and the people deserved to read the evidence for
themselves exactly as it was written.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the report came in, though, the language and descriptions
in it gave us pause. It wasn't language that we thought our readers
would be comfortable with in their newspaper, especially with the
knowledge that children might be exposed to it,'' said Witt, who
interrupted his vacation to consult with the newsroom by telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once ... it became apparent that we were in a no-win
situation,'' Vetter said, ``I showed excerpts to our publisher, Wes
Turner, who told the newsroom to do what we needed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   We've come to expect that kind of decision from Turner. He's the
boss, but in situations like this, the person on the ground gets to
make the call.
</P>
<P>
   Printing it all would have been the easy decision. It's
important. It'll be in the history books. We could always defend it
by saying we were simply doing our duty as we understood it in
light of the constitutional privilege we enjoy as a newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   But our editors did not take the easy route. They decided to
edit an already edited transcript, risking criticism from those who
would cry censorship. They even inserted editor's notes telling you
what they had taken out. And they decided to print the full text of
the report for free distribution at each of our main offices (and
by mail for a handling charge).
</P>
<P>
   ``Our goal was to make the descriptions a little less offensive
while leaving as much information as possible for the reader. We
knew that our readers could access the full text if they wished,''
Vetter said.
</P>
<P>
   And something unusual happened: In addition to creating traffic
jams in Arlington and at our printing plant, a number of people
called to thank us for the way we handled the report. We don't
really ever expect to hear from people we have pleased _ that's not
human nature _ so those thank-yous were especially nice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you people done an excellent job on that,'' said one
Arlington reader. ``You made it just difficult enough but not very
difficult at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the first press run was gone by the end of Monday, the
day we made the full report available, and we printed more. By
Wednesday evening, we had handed out 17,650, with another 225 going
in the mail. Requests are still arriving.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Vetter speaks for all of us, and certainly for the
journalists who have to make these kinds of decisions, when she
says:
</P>
<P>
   ``... Boy, do I hope I never have to read anything like that
again, let alone decide what to include in 240,000 copies of the
newspaper.''
</P>

HOUSTON CRUISE INDUSTRY GETS BOOST WITH NORWEGIAN SEA 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By HARRY SHATTUCK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The entertainment is more lavish. The pool deck more
spacious. The public rooms more inviting. The dining options more
diverse.
</P>
<P>
   And the air conditioning works like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   Bottom line: Houston's fledgling cruise industry should receive
a major boost in December when Norwegian Cruise Line replaces its
much-maligned Norwegian Star with a newer, bigger and _ by most
standards _ better ship on weekly Texaribbean sailings.
</P>
<P>
   The 1,534-passenger Norwegian Sea, currently based in San Juan,
will arrive at the Port of Houston for an inaugural Dec. 13
departure to Cancun and Cozumel on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula and
Roatan in Honduras' Bay Islands.
</P>
<P>
   The 42,000-ton ship will depart from the Barbours Cut terminal
each Sunday afternoon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   While the 10-year-old Sea lacks the classic styling and large
staterooms of the 800-passenger Star _ designed in 1973 as a plush
long-distance ocean liner _ its onboard amenities and practicality
are clearly superior.
</P>
<P>
   So is its image.
</P>
<P>
   By filling 90 percent of its beds during a 16-month presence as
Houston's first home-based cruise ship, the Norwegian Star has
provided NCL sufficient encouragement to almost double its weekly
capacity here.
</P>
<P>
   But the Star endured national ridicule last fall and winter when
faulty air conditioning _ attributed to problems with a generator _
resulted in passengers sleeping on open decks during sold-out
Thanksgiving and Christmas sailings. Another fully booked departure
during the New Year's holiday was canceled while the problems were
corrected.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the rest of 1998, the Star has sailed trouble-free.
It averaged 99 percent of passenger capacity in the just-completed
third quarter, according to an NCL spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 4, the Star will commence its final Texaribbean
itinerary. The ship will return Nov. 1 to start a 16-day
repositioning cruise through the Panama Canal to San Diego. Then it
will proceed to Australia for year-round itineraries in the South
Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   While its replacement here may not represent a ship of the
future _ if, that is, the future is measured by vessels of Goliath
proportions offered by Carnival, Princess and Royal Caribbean, the
Big Three of worldwide cruise lines _ the Norwegian Sea seems
ideally suited to Houston's current needs and for continued growth
within the industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``We remain bullish on Houston as a cruise port,'' says NCL
Executive Vice President Art Sbarsky. ``The major factor in the
city's favor is convenience. It's a good drive-in and fly-in
market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see three main audiences for the Norwegian Sea: those who
have enjoyed the Texaribbean itinerary and want to return on
another, bigger ship; those who like the Sea and want to sail on it
again with a new itinerary; and potential first-time cruisers.''
</P>
<P>
   One overriding factor in comparing the Sea and Star is that
Houston's newest ship, known as the Seaward until last year, was
built by NCL specifically for Caribbean cruising. The Star was
initially designed for luxury-oriented around-the-world
intineraries, but through ownership changes _ from Royal Viking to
Royal to NCL _ had evolved, for practical effect, into a vessel
with a mishmash of clashing personalities.
</P>
<P>
   ``That ship was built for a different market,'' says Sbarsky,
``and whether you like it or not depends on what you want from a
cruise. It has some wonderful features, but we would not design a
ship like the Norwegian Star to fit the purposes of NCL. With the
Sea, structure fits the strategy; with the Star, at times strategy
had to be adjusted to fit the structure.''
</P>
<P>
   The Star arrived here, too, with a history of mechanical
problems; the Sea carries a solid reputation for reliability. New
air conditioning has been installed this year in all its staterooms
and public rooms. And the Sea's chief engineer Jarle Fjordholm
says, ``We have so many backup systems on this ship that it would
take an extraordinary situation to shut anything down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ship reviewers' biggest complaints about the Sea have centered
on its small staterooms and on extensive use of painted metal
instead of teak, especially on a Promenade Deck that wraps around
the ship.
</P>
<P>
   Passengers also will notice higher brochure tariffs than for the
Star. Listed double-occupancy prices (excluding port taxes) for a
one-week sailing in January start at $1,249 per person for an
inside stateroom; $1,549 for an outside cabin; and $2,299 for a
suite. Those prices increase by $200 each for sailings beginning
Feb. 7. Holiday fares are higher.
</P>
<P>
   Don't settle for brochure fares, though. Most travel agents can
secure bookings at considerably lower prices. Be sure to ask about
bargains during the Sea's inaugural season.
</P>
<P>
   Here are other comparisons formed by sailings aboard both ships:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAVORING THE SUN &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sea's vast open deck areas represent a huge improvement and
should prove significant to the enjoyment of an itinerary that
includes three full days on the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The Star's one small pool is hidden behind the main showroom; by
contrast, the Sea features two pools _ one 42 feet by 14 feet _
separated by twin hot tubs and surrounded by hundreds of lounge
chairs. Additional seating on a sun deck overlooks the pools.
</P>
<P>
   Buffets are set up in the Big Apple Cafe _ a name NCL officials
would be wise to change for Texaribbean sailings _ at the rear of
the pool deck; though ample indoor seating exists, many passengers
carry trays outside and dine al fresco. Tables are abundant, and
glass sidings offer protection from wind.
</P>
<P>
   Poolside activities are plentiful. Other open-air areas are
reserved for a basketball half-court, golf driving net and table
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ENTERTAINMENT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Also an obvious upgrade are entertainment venues that will allow
presentation of full-scale revues featuring up to 15 singers and
dancers while maintaining popular Texaribbean acts such as singer
Jane Powell and comedian/magician Doug Anderson.
</P>
<P>
   The Star's lone showroom accommodates only 474; because most
seats are at stage-level, passengers' views frequently are blocked.
The stage is too small for large productions.
</P>
<P>
   Aboard the Sea, one lounge accommodates 770 in theater-style
seating; on each sailing it hosts NCL's signature
mini-Broadway-style production of ``Grease,'' two other extravagant
song-and-dance revues and individual acts.
</P>
<P>
   Another lounge, situated at the opposite end of the same deck,
holds 520 and is used primarily for pre- and post-dinner dancing
and late-night comedy and song.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The only real difference in formal dining procedures is that the
larger Sea features two main restaurants, the Star only one. The
menus and service routine are identical, and NCL plans to continue
its special Texaribbean dinners _ and 70 varieties of hot sauces _
aboard the newer ship.
</P>
<P>
   What gives the Norwegian Sea a decided edge is its additional
dining options.
</P>
<P>
   In the aforementioned Big Apple Cafe, self-service buffets are
available at breakfast, lunch and dinner. Swimsuit attire is
allowed. On our cruise, a majority of passengers chose this
alternative for midday meals that include an all-you-can-eat
selection of hot entrees, vegetables, salads, cold cuts, breads and
desserts. Especially popular, too, on days in port are
late-afternoon megasnacks: pizzas, quiche, baked potatoes and chili
on a rotating basis. Light selections are available into the wee
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Even more impressive is Le Bistro, an alternative restaurant
(with the only charge a recommended gratuity) open for dinner on
the highest deck. Except for daily specials, the menu remains
standard throughout a cruise, but it's tempting to dine here
several times given the stellar Continental cuisine, flexible
dining hours and unrushed service, and an ambience of casual
elegance.
</P>
<P>
   The Norwegian Star also features Le Bistro. But on that ship, it
was carved from a corner of the main restaurant as an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Late-night buffets are scheduled on the pool deck or in dining
rooms. Unlike the Star, the Sea does not currently have a pizzeria;
that feature may be added.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
OTHER PUBLIC ROOMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Sea's medium-range size (by current ship standards) is put
to good use.
</P>
<P>
   Among enhancements:
</P>
<P>
   Two small but well-designed rooms _ Gatsby's Wine Bar and
Oscar's Pub _ are reserved for evening piano music. Gatsby's,
situated atop the ship near Le Bistro, also offers sweeping views.
Though touted as the one public room for cigar smokers, ventilation
is good enough that most nonsmokers won't be bothered. Those who
are can relax in an adjacent Observatory Lounge and still hear the
music.
</P>
<P>
   Boomers, a 132-seat disco, draws a lively crowd well into the
early morning. This, too, is a marked improvement; the Star's
sports bar doubled as a disco.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea's casino is bigger (178 slot machines and 11 tables,
seven for blackjack), brighter and more centrally located than its
counterpart on the Star.
</P>
<P>
   The health club, though smaller than on some newer ships, is air
conditioned _ unlike on the Star, where passengers worked up a
sweat even before working out.
</P>
<P>
   A shopping area is better arranged, more conveniently located
and more than twice the size of the boutiques aboard the Star.
</P>
<P>
   Chairs and tables placed beside windows near elevators on
lodging decks are a nice touch, especially for passengers who
relish reading or needlework.
</P>
<P>
   Fans of the Star's sports bar may be disappointed; no area
aboard the Sea is dedicated specifically to sports memorabilia and
telecasts. But live transmission of events is so limited on the
Star that this loss will barely be noticed. And NCL's new
partnership with Sports Illustrated likely will lead to additional
sports theme cruises.
</P>
<P>
   Of more concern _ especially given the three sea days _ is the
absence of a full library aboard the Sea.
</P>
<P>
   Ongoing refurbishments include new carpeting and upholstery and
new, brighter furnishings in some rooms.
</P>
<P>
   As on the Star, NCL's youth programs will operate year-round
(with an increased counseling staff in the peak summer family
season). Separate programs are conducted for teens and preteens.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
STATEROOMS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here's the tradeoff for all those nice common areas.
</P>
<P>
   During the era of the Norwegian Star's construction _ before
Caribbean cruising gained popularity _ staterooms were spacious and
featured enough storage room for sailings of several months. Today,
the trend again is toward large cabins _ and with balconies _ as
the industry competes with land resorts for business.
</P>
<P>
   But the Norwegian Sea was built during an intermediate period
when the main objective was to get passengers out of their cabins _
by giving those staterooms a compact and uniform design _ and into
casinos, bars and shops where they might be inclined to invest some
money.
</P>
<P>
   The Sea's accommodations include only seven suites. Almost all
other staterooms fall into two categories with dimensions of 122
and 140 square feet _ considerably smaller than many cabins aboard
the Star. About 200 staterooms have no ocean views; several others
have restricted views. Bathrooms are minuscule, with showers (and
no tubs) in all but 25 rooms or suites. Closet space is adequate.
</P>
<P>
   Rooms are well-appointed, and twin beds can be arranged as a
double. (A bit of trivia: Duvets are used for covering on the Sea;
the Star uses standard bedsheets). Beds become makeshift sofas
during the day.
</P>
<P>
   Four staterooms are designed for passengers in wheelchairs or
with hearing impairments. (Accessibility throughout the ship is
good; elevators serve all decks and room entrances are easily
negotiated.)
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ITINERARY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only one change will occur in the established Texaribbean
routine, with Cancun substituted for Calica in Mexico. That's an
improvement for two reasons: (1) Cancun offers more enticements;
(2) docking conditions in Calica were so erratic that the Star
missed too many calls. &QL;

<P>
   Religious leaders often talk about a teachable moment -- a time
when events focus public attention on a moral question in an
unprecedented way.
</P>
<P>
   For example, during the months leading up to the Gulf War,
Americans conducted an extensive discussion about the nature of a
just war.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton/Lewinsky scandal has been a painful time for all
Americans. But it has also been a teachable moment -- a time when
the public's attention has been focused on core moral and ethical
issues, including the nature of sin, forgiveness, and trust;
professional ethics, and the connection between private and public
morality.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, this moment has been squandered. The tone of
moral debate has been set by the tabloids -- a category that now
includes just about all of the media.
</P>
<P>
   We can hope that there may be some improvement now that the
Starr Report and the grand jury videotape are out. The president
himself has said he has sinned and commmitted to working out his
personal problems with an accountability circle of three ministers.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, the only religious leaders who have spoken
out are those who disapprove of President Clinton no matter what he
does and those who love him no matter what he does. Most religious
leaders are extremely reluctant to talk about public controversy
involving sex or partisan politics, and this controversy involves
both.
</P>
<P>
   But the failure to speak out in a situation that demands cool
heads, nuance and moral perspective is a dereliction of duty on the
part of America's religious leaders.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be surprising at a time when the professions of
politics, law and media have generally disgraced themselves. But we
expect more from religious leaders, if only because they tell us we
should.
</P>
<P>
   Here, then, are some of the things that religious leaders, and
anyone concerned about morality and ethics, should be saying:
</P>
<P>
   --It is always wrong to spread false or malicious stories.
</P>
<P>
   --Everyone sins. The American Heritage Dictionary defines sin as
``a transgression of a religious or moral law, especially when
deliberate.'' Someone once called original sin -- the belief that
every human being sins at some time or other -- the most
empirically verifiable religious belief. Jesus came to the defense
of an adulteress woman by telling a crowd, ``Let he who is without
sin cast the first stone.'' Lots of people who mistakenly believe
they are without sin are throwing a lot of stones today. No one
alive could go through $40 million of federal investigation and not
have a sin or two turn up.
</P>
<P>
   --All sins are not equal. Sins differ in both their nature and
their context. Stealing a pizza is wrong and so is murder, but the
offenses are far from equal. And stealing a pizza for fun, stealing
it to trade for drugs, and stealing it to feed a starving family
are also very different offenses.
</P>
<P>
   --When someone asks for forgiveness, he or she must also do
penance and take steps to show that he or she will not repeat the
offense. Most of those at the recent White House Prayer Breakfast
believed the president is sincere in his efforts to repent and
change his ways. It is far less clear what the president would have
to do to repent in his public life, partly because the public
continues to believe he's doing a good job.
</P>
<P>
   --The test of your commitment to ethical standards is your
willingness to stick to them when it's not convenient. If grand
jury testimony is supposed to be secret, it's supposed to be secret
even when leaking it would give you an advantage. If reporters are
supposed to verify stories before they report them, they have to
verify them even when skipping that stage would give them a scoop.
If we throw out ethical standards to seek a temporary advantage,
then our commitment to those standards is a sham.
</P>
<P>
   --We must evaluate people by the sum of their actions. About 20
years ago I mused to a wizened editor that good people sometimes do
bad things and bad people sometimes do good things. He replied,
``And there are very few good people or bad people.'' We should
practice humility when we attempt to judge people.
</P>
<P>
   --What we think of someone today can change dramatically
depending on what they do tomorrow, or what new facts emerge
tomorrow. We evaluate people in different ways in different
circumstances; we may stop considering someone a friend, but still
admire his or her talents. When George Wallace died recently, he
was remembered as a symbol of racism in the 1960s and early 70s,
but also as a symbol of racial reconciliation since then.
</P>
<P>
   Americans have always lived with ambiguous attitudes toward
their presidents. Did John F. Kennedy risk his presidency with his
reckless private life? Did Lyndon Johnson do more good with the
Great Society than he did harm with the Vietnam War? Even many
liberals who detested Richard Nixon when he was in office look back
on many of his domestic policies as surprisingly liberal by today's
standards. Many people who stand by Clinton today believe, for
example, that some of the tough provisions in the 1996 welfare law
he signed were immoral, but still support him for other reasons.
</P>
<P>
   --We should evaluate public officials primarily on the basis of
their public responsibilities to advance the common good. Private
action is not irrelevant, but it must be seen in perspective.
Several clerics at the White House breakfast argued that Clinton's
personal failings, which they described as adultery, sexual sin and
broken marriage vows, must be seen in the context of his record as
president.
</P>
<P>
   Morality is often a matter of proportionality. The just-war
theory argues that to be morally justified, the good that a war
achieves must outweigh the evil that it causes.
</P>
<P>
   That's a daunting standard -- one that should apply to every
major public undertaking.

 &HT;    GEORGES POUNDS PUERTO RICO; DOMINICAN REPUBLIC, HAITI BRACE FOR
DISASTER
 &HT;    EDs: Story may need to be updated after 6 p.m. EDT.
 &HT;    By SHELLEY EMLING 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ As if doing battle, Hurricane Georges charged across
Puerto Rico late Monday, packing winds of 110 mph that churned
20-foot seas, knocked out electrical service, and forced families
to huddle in basements and walk-in closets.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 people sought shelter in schools and public
buildings in both Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the
U.S. territories declared states of emergency while activating
National Guard troops.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello banned liquor sales, ordered a
price freeze on items such as water, candles and matches, and had
officials prepare more than 300 shelters on this island of 3.8
million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really nervous because we remember the damage done
by Hugo,'' said Mary McClintock, a resident of San Juan, Puerto
Rico who planned to take refuge in her cement home's walk-in
closet. ``People have stocked up on food and water, and I'd say
they are scared.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Hugo killed more than two dozen people when it ripped
through the Caribbean in 1989, and caused billions of dollars in
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Georges began pounding a string of Caribbean islands overnight
on Sunday, starting with the French territory of Guadeloupe, where
the ferocious storm uprooted trees as if they were houseplants.
</P>
<P>
   Georges also ripped off roofs, tore down phone lines, and
knocked out electrical service on the islands of Antigua, St.
Croix, and St. Kitts and Nevis, but no injuries or deaths were
immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Some cruise ships veered south to get out of Georges' path,
while others changed their schedules and headed to storm-free
Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   In general, residents on many islands struck by Georges breathed
a big sigh of relief that the damage wasn't more extensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was some damage, but it wasn't as bad as expected
because we took precautions,'' said Nevis' deputy premier Malcolm
Guishard. ``The electricity is out but phones are working and the
streets really aren't flooded.''
</P>
<P>
   Georges was expected late Monday to hit Puerto Rico's capital of
San Juan, where nearly half the island's population lives. Anxious
residents stripped supermarket shelves of essentials, and hunkered
down in their homes, while government officials closed the San Juan
airport and ordered people off beaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's quiet outside, no one is working, there is little traffic
on the streets,'' said Alex Maldonado, a columnist for the San Juan
Star newspaper. ``But people here are used to the threat of
hurricanes and they know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Georges' strength had dwindled considerably since early Sunday,
when the hurricane sustained winds of 150 mph, but the U.S.
National Hurricane Center warned that Georges -- a strong Category
2 hurricane -- was still ``extremely dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Florida residents grew increasingly apprehensive on Monday even
though forecasters said it was too early to tell how serious a
threat Georges will pose to the southeastern United States.
</P>
<P>
   A hurricane warning was issued Monday for the Dominican
Republic, which braced for disaster. Hurricane watches went into
effect for northern Haiti, the southeastern Bahamas, the Turks and
Caicos Islands and eastern Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   This weekend, first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton was scheduled to
make her first visit to Haiti and the Dominican Republic, where she
was expected to meet with leaders of non-government organizations
to talk about judicial reform, maternal health, and other matters.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, more than a dozen members of Clinton's White House
advance team, including Secret Service personnel, left the
Dominican Republic ahead of the hurricane for fear of being stuck
there.
</P>
<P>
   It was not clear Monday whether the first lady would still make
the trip.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Dominican Republic dispatched its civil defense,
national emergency committee, the Red Cross, and police to assist
in preparations for Georges' arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``The supermarkets are a little busier than usual, but I think
most people are waiting to see what happens in Puerto Rico before
they take any real action,'' said an official at the U.S. Embassy
in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Puerto Rico, Haiti is woefully unprepared for Georges,
which could send tin and wood shacks toppling down hillsides when,
and if it hits.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the less-powerful Tropical Storm Gordon killed
approximately 2,000 residents in floods and mudslides in this
impoverished country.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Now we may never be certain whether we've ever had sex
 &HT;    By Michael Skube
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   I think I've had about as much sex as I can take. Why don't we
talk about something else _ capital gains taxes, maybe, or Bobby
Cox's pitching rotation in the playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   You'd think that if anything should arouse interest, it would be
sex. Don't you remember how completely absorbing it used to be?
There was nothing like it.
</P>
<P>
   At a certain point in our lives, it's an awakening to another
dimension, a little bit frightening but immensely fascinating.
</P>
<P>
   But we ruin it like we ruin everything else. We wear it out
(although I sure didn't think I did) and finally it bores us.
</P>
<P>
   Playboy magazine tried to celebrate sexuality and ended up
making it tiresome and predictable. Kenneth Starr's Grand
Inquisitors don't go around in their pajamas like Hugh Hefner, but
they're making it just as boring.
</P>
<P>
   Define, please, ``sexual relations.'' If those were not the
exact words used by prosecutor Robert Bittman, they were close.
Does it mean, as Monica Lewinsky apparently wrote in one of her
letters to the president, ``the lying down kind,'' or does it
include what used to be called foreplay and petting?
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers don't think like lovers. They think like people who
write instruction manuals, identifying the individual parts,
enumerating the steps whereby part A is attached to part B and both
are inserted into part C and all them are bolted onto Part D and
Part E is somehow or other hooked on to it and the whole thing
eventually takes shape as a tricycle. They take the fun out of it.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, trying to answer a prosecutor's question,
President Clinton said: ``If Jane and Harry had a sexual
relationship, most people would interpret that as sexual
intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   This was the president of the United States, speaking in the
very room where President Roosevelt and General Eisenhower planned
the invasion of Normandy, and he's having to talk about somebody
named Jane and Harry having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Who are Jane and Harry anyway? Are they going to be deposed,
too? We need to get to the bottom of this.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton was giving his deposition, the Dow Jones and
Nasdaq averages flashed intermittently in the lower right hand
corner of the screen, like (as Lance Morrow of Time magazine put
it) an electrocardiogram. How are our vital signs while Kenneth
Starr's prosecutors probe deeper for Truth?
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the century, there was a branch of philosophy called
logical positivism, which held truth to be a matter of defining
terms. A statement was true or untrue depending on what was meant
by the terms that constituted it. Some statements _ five plus five
is 10 _ were true by definition. Those were the easy ones. Others
presented more difficulty. If we said, ``Democracy is the best form
of government,'' we had to be clear about what we meant by
``democracy'' and by ``best.''
</P>
<P>
   Watching Clinton's deposition, with the prosecutor's pedantic
voice in the background, I thought about logicians defining sex.
``Sexual relations'' means this, this and this, but not that.
</P>
<P>
   In high school, we knew very well what was meant by ``going all
the way.'' No amount of logic chopping clouded the picture. There
were the preliminaries, and the vernacular described them with more
than adequate precision. No one puzzled over meanings.
</P>
<P>
   Sex still excited, still aroused, still engendered mystery.
</P>
<P>
   But the mystery's gone. Sex is banal and oversaturated. We've
all made it so, of course. Kenneth Starr's gang can't take all the
credit. It's ubiquitous and obligatory. Nothing can be interesting
without it _ not a novel, not a movie, not even, apparently, an
impeachment inquiry. The inevitable happens: Sex becomes boring,
too.
</P>
<P>
   But it has to be said that Kenneth Starr's prosecution of the
president has done for sex what not even Playboy could do. The
centerfolds always were sterile and without the imperfections of
the body that make sex enjoyable. Now come these guys, talking
about it like garage full of Mr. Goodwrenches, and you're not even
sure you knew what it was. Maybe that wasn't actually sex we had,
but only sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   Which one's better?

 &HT;    Hughley sitcom humor about life, not race or gender
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When stand-up comic D.L. Hughley was growing up in the Watts
section of Los Angeles, he says he never saw white people until he
was 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched 'Price is Right' and they would say, 'I live here in
L.A.,' and I'd go, 'I've never seen you around here', '' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But stand-up paid off for Hughley (pronounced HYOO-glee), and he
moved to an upper-middle-class neighborhood with mostly white
neighbors. And that, in turn, paid off, with a sitcom loosely based
on his own life, ``The Hughleys'' (8:30 EDT tonight on ABC), one of
the better comedies in a rather parched field this seasonal
kick-off week.
</P>
<P>
   It's the second, and better, of the two new sitcoms about black
families moving into all-white neighborhoods, after Fox's ``Living
in Captivity.'' Darryl Hughley, rich off a booming vending machine
business, moves with his wife and two cute but not icky-cute kids,
and then spends most of his time missing the old neighborhood,
vigilantly looking out for racism and worrying that he and/or his
family are losing their African-American identity. And they given
him plenty of cause for concern, from his son, who'd rather listen
to Hanson than Marvin Gaye, to his daughter, who prefers a white
doll to a black one.
</P>
<P>
   One of several things ``The Hughleys'' manages well is to talk
about race in America today without being too in-your-face
provocative (it's a sitcom, not a treatise) or too
can't-we-all-just-get-along. It also doesn't confine itself to
race, being as much about the division between genders. The latter
is much more of a sitcom tradition that we're comfortable with,
just like Darryl's wife Yvonne (Elise Neal), who's the practical
household anchor to his borderline hysteria.
</P>
<P>
   And some of the humor isn't as much about race or gender as it
is about just plain life. In an upcoming episode, Darryl gets stuck
driving the kids' carpool to school in the family minivan (the bane
of suburban would-be studs everywhere). That may sound like the 2%
milk of humor, and it's not exactly cutting edge, but Hughley makes
it work, with ample assistance from John Henson (``Living
Single''), who plays his buddy Milsap.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' isn't blazing any new comedy trails, but it
moves well on the trails it inhabits, and that's saying something
this season.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   SEEN AND HEARD
</P>
<P>
   Are we still mad about ``Mad About You''?
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when Paul Reiser's ``Mad About You'' was one of
the better sitcoms on TV. That was about three Emmys, one Oscar and
a Golden Globe ago (all won for this show and ``As Good As It
Gets'' by series co-star Helen Hunt).
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's ``Mad'' season premiere (8 p.m. on NBC (8377)) proves
the show's just coasting now _ its stars apparently resting on
their $1 million-an-episode laurels. He takes a Viagra pill; she
gets caught out on the streets of New York wearing only a towel.
</P>
<P>
   It's every joke you've already heard about the new male wonder
drug. And even a surprise cameo by NBC's once-biggest sitcom star
can't keep this show from going, well, limp.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: C
</P>

<P>
   No ``Encore'' from this corner
</P>
<P>
   What's wrong with network television can be summed up in one
word (spoken, or in this case, exclaimed twice): ``Encore!
Encore!'' (8:30 EDT tonight on NBC).
</P>
<P>
   It's the age-old network ploy of hiring a talented name star
(like Nathan Lane), pairing that celeb with talented name co-stars
(like Glenne Headly and Joan Plowright) and then trying to figure
out the funny parts.
</P>
<P>
   This show smells like it has one writer and about 30 network
suits working on the script. Lane plays American opera singer Joey
Pinoni (in effect, a tenor diva) whose voice is injured. It's then
back to mama (Plowright) and sibling rival Francesca (Headly) in
the family winery in Napa Valley for rest, rehabilitation and
ridiculous hilarity.
</P>
<P>
   Pratfalls, too. In this show, one of Lane's first antics is flop
out of a hospital bed. Loud canned laughter ensues.
</P>
<P>
   This is the kind of joke you get on this show. Francesca's hot
and bothered because a bored Joey's taken her high school bookworm
son Michael (Trevor Fehrman) out with call girls. She's beating
Joey up. ``Shut up,'' she says. ``This isn't Italy and I'm not some
earthy woman with hairy armpits who doesn't care if her kid grows
up with the morals of an alleycat.''
</P>
<P>
   Joey's zinger: ``Actually, that would be France.''
</P>

 &HT;    Newsweek reveals that Bill Clinton ignored his lawyers' advice
not to testify before the grand jury.
 &HT;    By Don O'Briant
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Published before the president's grand jury videotape was aired
Monday, the newsweeklies were forced to focus on what will happen
next. Time ($2.95) reports that Clinton advisers and top Democrats
have been working behind the scenes to devise an exit strategy
short of impeachment or resignation. Newsweek ($2.95), quoting
sources who had seen the videotape, described Clinton as being
enraged at times and evasive at others. But, as the magazine's Evan
Thomas and Michael Isikoff explain, the president would not have
been viewed twisting in the wind by millions if he had followed the
advice of his attorneys. David Kendall and Robert Bennett opposed
his testifying; Hillary Rodham Clinton urged him to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the first lady, U.S. News &AMP; World Report ($2.95)
profiles Mrs. Clinton and speculates about her chances of saving
her husband. Included is a new poll that shows Americans admire her
but are cynical about her marriage. Forty-eight percent of those
surveyed believe the marriage is basically a political alliance.
</P>
<P>
   In a more literary approach to the scandal, The New Yorker ($3)
offers two original takes on the Starr report. Rebecca Mead
contends that the only sexual abuse that took place was at the
hands of the independent counsel. After pressuring Lewinsky with
threats, Mead writes, Starr then ``compels her, in her grand-jury
testimony, to speak with a specificity somewhere between the
pornographic and the gynecological. ... Starr wanted to see the
President laid low, and Lewinsky got laid low in the process.''
</P>
<P>
   And what about the Starr report as literature? Adam Gopnik
critiques it as a novel, comparing it to such morality tales as
``The Scarlet Letter.''
</P>
<P>
   THE LAST HEROES: More than three decades ago, John Glenn and his
fellow astronauts were hailed as heroes with ``the right stuff.''
In its October issue, Life ($3.99) returns to that age of innocence
with a cover story on the eve of John Glenn's space voyage and
revisits the survivors of the Mercury Seven program. Refreshingly,
each of the men rejects the term ``hero'' for himself. Says L.
Gordon Cooper: ``I guess my idea of a real hero is some guy,
knowing he could be killed in a combat situation, still putting
himself down to save his buddies.''
</P>
<P>
   THE NAKED TRUTH: Pamela Anderson bares her soul _ and nearly
everything else _ in a Details ($2.50) cover story that shows her
re-creating the famous Farrah Fawcett swimsuit poster of 1977. On
the eve of her new series, ``V.I.P.,'' Anderson insists she is not
a bimbo, although she has played one on TV.
</P>
<P>
   TAKING CARE OF BUSINESS: Atlantans Jermaine Dupri of So So Def
Recordings and Jeff Arnold, founder of Endeavor Technologies, are
two of the top 50 young entrepreneurs, according to the October
issue of P.O.V. ($2.95). Not surprisingly, most of the 50 are in
high-tech fields. Also of note: a fun first-person account of
writer Nicole Beland's experiences at a Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders
audition. Why, she wonders, would 250 modern young women spend
three days trying out for a job that involves kicking and screaming
and pays $50 a week? Good question.
</P>
<P>
   BIG AUDIENCE: When Camryn Manheim of TV's ``The Practice''
proudly held up her Emmy and proclaimed, ``This is for all the fat
girls!'' she was echoing the motto of Radiance ($6), a magazine
devoted to plus-size women. Manheim is on the cover of the fall
edition. Published for 14 years, Radiance features interviews with
calorically overwhelmed celebrities along with articles on health
and fashion. Now, says publisher Alice Ansfield, ``We're expanding
our focus to include children of all ages. We want to help them
feel seen, loved, and valued for who they are, whatever their size
or shape.''

 &HT;    `Shoot Me's' comic aim swings closer to the mark
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   There was a time, not too long ago, when a producer could have
gone to NBC pitching a miniseries about a 21st-century Hispanic
time traveler who discovers the lost continent of Atlantis, and it
would have wound up on the air as a sitcom about an attractive
young white woman with a messy love life who works at a magazine.
</P>
<P>
   So when ``Just Shoot Me'' debuted last year, it was easy to
dismiss as another product of NBC's comedy committee. A ``Suddenly
Susan'' wannabe is like a kid who wants to dress up as Donald Trump
for Halloween.
</P>
<P>
   But after a rickety launch, ``Shoot Me'' started shooting off in
wonderfully unpredictable ways. It developed a voice, an attitude,
an ensemble and, fairly quickly, an audience. At one point last
season, NBC had it following ``Seinfeld'' on Thursday nights and it
was actually getting better ratings than ``Seinfeld,'' which led to
talk it might be the heir apparent for 9 p.m. ET Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   That honor, of course, went to quintuple Emmy winner
``Frasier,'' but ``Shoot Me'' got NBC's Miss Congeniality prize _
``Frasier's'' old home, 9 p.m. ET Tuesdays, where it comes back
tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Laura San Giacomo is still top-billed as Maya Gallo, the
reluctant writer for Cosmoesque Blush magazine, but ``Shoot'' soars
on its near-perfectly pitched ensemble, much as ``Cheers'' did.
George Segal is Jack Gallo, Maya's blustery mogul dad and Blush's
publisher; Wendie Malick is Nina, the neurotic ex-model who dabbles
at being fashion editor between her nightlife and assignations;
Elliott (Enrico Colatoni) is the photographer who's still a bit
unclear _ is he insecure or not?
</P>
<P>
   And then there's Dennis Finch, the role of a lifetime for David
Spade. The former ``Saturday Night Live'' player was looking down
the barrel of a career as second banana to Chris Farley in
two-thumbs-down movies when ``Shoot'' beckoned. As Jack Gallo's
assistant, Finch is the ultimate office weasel, a snotty, whiny,
backstabbing, smarmy boy who's so self-absorbed he's like a human
roll of Bounty paper towels. And this in an office where full-blown
narcissism barely gets you into the morning editorial meeting.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the smartest thing about ``Shoot'': When the producers
saw the Finch character taking off, they refused to do a Fonzie and
rebuild the show around him.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's season premiere is just dandy, with Finch betraying
Jack, Nina in the clutches of a cult, Elliott abandoning Maya at a
time of need and Maya extracting a very funny revenge.
</P>
<P>
   The throwaway lines crackle, that funky little bass line loops
through the segues, and ``Just Shoot Me'' hits its marks.
</P>
<P>
   On next year's Emmy Awards, look for it to be at least a
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just Shoot Me''
</P>
<P>
   Grade: A-
</P>
<P>
   9 EDT, tonight on NBC
</P>
<P>
   The verdict: Just watch it.

 &HT;    ``Sports Night'' a good show, but its not of championship
caliber
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Can a sitcom about a nightly sports highlights show be better
than those ESPN commericials?
</P>
<P>
   No. It can't. But it can try. ABC's ``Sports Night,'' a
fictionalized take on ESPN's ``SportsCenter,'' does a better job
than it has any right to at fashioning a sometimes heart-tugging
comedy around the on-air and behind-the-scenes antics of a nightly
sports highlights show.
</P>
<P>
   This is TV sports as the e.r., and a show about TV sports as
``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   They're saving sports fans' lives in that control booth:
</P>
<P>
   ``I need 15 points of sound on Kansas City!''
</P>
<P>
   ``... Give me Green Bay.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Stand by audio. Stand by VTR.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're live here in 60 seconds!''
</P>
<P>
   A camera drunk on adrenaline roams the ``Sports Night'' booth to
caputre the drama in a bank of monitors, people wearing headsets,
people pushing buttons. Then, just when you think this might be
brain surgery, somebody asks the big question: Is Helsinki the
capital of Sweden or Finland? Fans need to know.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night,'' airing on a network owned by the same
conglomerate that owns ESPN (Disney), manages to be more than a
bald stab at corporate synergy.
</P>
<P>
   It centers on the lives and personalities of Dan (Josh Charles)
and Casey (Peter Krause), this nightly sports show's young,
likeable anchors. They speak a kind of sport's fan's Esperanto:
that peculiar male mix of sports-as-intimacy and
intimacy-as-sports. When Dan and Casey confront each other about
Casey's impending divorce, and how it's detracting from the show,
they exchange pointed verbal punches _ then slip right into talk
about rugby.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's something I don't understand about rugby,'' Casey says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wait a minute,'' Dan interrupts, ``you understand something
about rugby?''
</P>
<P>
   Translation: I love you, man.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight's pilot does a swift, sure-handed job of mixing the
personal with the professional. It's a sitcom with heart _ there
are moments near the end of tonight's pilot and next week's second
episode that aim to make the male ape cry.
</P>
<P>
   But what ``Sports Night'' is really about is the '90s concept of
office as family. Included in the brood here is tough-love producer
Dana (Felicity Huffman), who serves for viewers as a kind of
traffic cop for men who love sports and the women who love them;
executive producer Isaac (Robert Guillaume), the bridge between the
talent's heart and corporate suits' heartlessness; and new-hire
researcher Jeremy (Joshua Malina), a bridge between jocks and
nerds.
</P>
<P>
   It all works well tonight, but heads too greedily toward the
joke pile by next week. This is a tricky concept to pull off: a
sitcom with a dramatic itch; a show about sports that's not about
sports.
</P>
<P>
   It might be the new season's best sitcom. Root for it. Just
don't bet on it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' Grade: B+
</P>

   9:30 ET tonight on ABC

ROBIN WILLIAMS TACKLES THE FIGHT OF HIS AFTERLIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (This ``separate buy'' article is from this week's StarBeat
entertainment package.) 
 (To publish this article, it must be purchased _ the rate is not
prohibitive _ from New York Times Syndicate sales representative
CONNIE WHITE in Kansas City at 1-800-444-0267 or 816-822-8448, or
by fax at 816-822-1444.) 
 (She also has information on how to subscribe to StarBeat, a weekly
package of five intriguing features with color art.) 
 Includes a color slide of Robin Williams in a scene from ``What
Dreams May Come.'' 
 By CINDY PEARLMAN  
 World rights except Chicago 
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Naturally, Robin Williams has his own idea of hell.
 &HT;    Think of it as a game show, a celestial version of ``Let's Make
a Deal.''
 &HT;    ``Behind door No. 1 there is a videotape,'' Williams says.
``It's heaven. It's very calm. People are floating around, dressed
in white. I'd say, `It's very nice, but I'd like to see door No.
2.'''
 &HT;    Inside that door waits another video.
 &HT;    ``It's a wild disco! Girls are naked! The Champagne is flowing!
There's kissing! There's fornication! It's wild!''' Williams raves.
 &HT;    Casting everything to the winds, the actor/comedian says, he'd
probably pick that second door.
 &HT;    ``I get in the elevator and go down, down, down. The doors open
_ it's burning hell! The devil says, `You're mine!' I'm going,
`Wait a minute, what about the tape?'
 &HT;    ``The devil says, `Oh, obviously you just saw the pilot.'''
 &HT;    Williams throws back his head and laughs loudly.
 &HT;    ``Oh, this is going to be a good day,'' he says, looking around
his suite at Los Angeles' Four Seasons Hotel. ``We're starting out
right.''
 &HT;    Heaven and hell are on his mind because on Oct. 2 he'll open at
theaters everywhere in the much-awaited fall drama ``What Dreams
May Come,'' about a man who dies and, in an effort to rejoin his
anguished wife (Annabella Sciorra), finds himself forced to
traverse both ends of the afterlife experience.
 &HT;    Don't expect it to look like a game show.
 &HT;    ``The fact that you have to deal with emotional issues of loss
and redemption meant a lot of soul searching,'' the actor admits,
sobering. ``I lost my father a few years ago, and this dredged a
lot of it back up again. It was a hard-core experience.''
 &HT;    One scene, for example, required Williams to walk across a
barren hellscape with human heads sticking up out of the ground,
tormented souls wailing in pain.
 &HT;    ``It was awful,'' he recalls, ``but not for the reasons you
think. These were real people whose heads were popping out of the
ground. And it's strange, because these extras would yell out,
`Hey, Robin, step on me! Do it, man!' I cracked one guy's glasses,
and he started yelling, `Do it again!'''
 &HT;    Nor was life in heaven any picnic.
 &HT;    ``Flying like an angel was torture,'' Williams says, who'd
already done his share of levitation in ``Hook'' (1991). ``You want
real hell? Hell is when you have a rig attached to your lower
regions. This rig would turn any man into a human Ken doll.''
 &HT;    Which isn't to say that the actor/comedian doesn't believe in
heaven or hell.
 &HT;    ``Oh, yes. I do,'' he says readily. ``I think you get coming
attractions of heaven in your dreams. I call them visions. I also
think there are places on earth where, if it's not heaven, it's a
real nice start ... There are days when I look at my kids playing
and I think, `This is heaven.' It's not just a contentment, but a
power surge in your heart.
 &HT;    ``I'm not the fire-and-brimstone type,'' he adds, ``but I know
hell exists. In fact, there is hell on earth. To me that hell is
those videotapes of Kuwait after the wells were on fire and the sky
was so dark. That's the closest thing to hell I've ever seen.''
 &HT;    On a more personal level, he sees a different kind of hell.
 &HT;    ``I think hell is madness or any psychosis,'' he muses. ``People
who are manic depressives have described that condition as being in
hell. Hell is when everything is crashing in on you.''
 &HT;    The core of the film is the idea that everyone has a soul mate _
an idea Williams won't argue with.
 &HT;    ``I found my soul mate in my wife, Marsha,'' he says. ``All I
have to do is look at her and know that we belong together. Our
life together is extraordinary, which just confirms it.''
 &HT;    Williams' life has been extraordinary all around, actually. Last
March, he won an Oscar for his role as a kindly psychologist in
``Good Will Hunting'' (1997).
 &HT;    ``It was a welcome relief after all those years of going,
`Daniel Day-Lewis, I am so happy for you,''' Williams says, blowing
fake smoke into the air.
 &HT;    More seriously, the actor denies being nervous beforehand.
 &HT;    ``The other times I was nominated, I was sure I would lose,'' he
says. ``I was the wild card _ I didn't expect much. This time I
really thought I had a 50-50 shot, which just relaxed me.''
 &HT;    Even so, when his name was announced as Best Supporting Actor,
Williams recalls, ``Marsha had to literally give me a shove. I just
sat there. I was stunned. Finally, Marsha whispered into my ear,
`I'm so proud of you. Now get up there!'''
 &HT;    It was a culmination of sorts for the rich but insecure kid who
grew up in Detroit as the son of a successful auto-industry
executive.
 &HT;    ``I was much shorter than the other kids, so it was about
survival for me back then,'' he recalls. ``I was always this hairy
little guy with white, pasty skin. The other kids would call me
`The Leprechaun.'''
 &HT;    It's hard to picture, but Williams insists he was an introvert.
 &HT;    ``Oh, I was a very shy boy who was slow and awkward,'' he says.
``I walked around afraid of what people would say about me.''
 &HT;    At home, the real Williams would emerge.
 &HT;    ``I would go into my mom's bedroom and do all these skits,'' he
recalls. ``All I wanted to do was make her laugh.''
 &HT;    When the family moved to San Francisco, however, a teen-age
Williams found stand-up comedy, and his place in life.
 &HT;    ``San Francisco in the late '60s was a real wild time _ a lot of
severe medication,'' Williams says. ``To tell you the truth,
everything seemed really funny. Our high-school cheer was `Reality!
Reality! Wow!'''
 &HT;    Club comedy led to guest appearances on television shows,
including a ``Happy Days'' role that led to his hit series, ``Mork
and Mindy.'' From there Williams sought the big screen, forging a
double-headed career as a zany comedian _ in ``Popeye'' (1980),
``Good Morning Vietnam'' (1987) and ``Flubber'' (1997) _ and as a
``real'' actor in such serious dramas as ``Dead Poet's Society''
(1989), ``Awakenings'' (1990) and ``The Fisher King'' (1991).
 &HT;    The serious side seems to be predominant these days. Immediately
after filming ``What Dreams,'' the actor headed off to Poland to
film ``Jacob the Liar,'' set in a Polish ghetto in 1944.
 &HT;    ``The Germans would jam people into these ghettos before sending
them to the camps,'' Williams says. ``And, in the ghettos, people
would carry on this illusion of a normal life. People worked. There
were theater performances. People were still trying to maintain
their human dignity, but this idea of extermination just hung over
them.''
 &HT;    Not that Williams the comedian is done for, of course. He does
have the Christmas comedy ``Patch Adams,'' directed by Tom ``Ace
Ventura'' Shadyac, in the can. And he's pondering a sequel to his
hit 1996 gay comedy, ``The Birdcage.''
 &HT;    ``If Nathan Lane, Mike Nichols and Gene Hackman want to do it,
I'm in,'' he says.
 &HT;    For now, though, this busiest of actors is stepping offstage.
 &HT;    ``I'm taking until February off to just be with my wife and
children,'' says Williams, who lives in San Francisco with his wife
and three kids: 14-year-old Zack, 8-year-old Zelda and 4-year-old
Cody.
 &HT;    ``My heaven is just sneaking around the house late at night and
checking on everyone,'' he says. ``Just knowing that they're fine
and happy makes my heart pound.''

 Includes a color slide of Whoopi Goldberg in a scene from
``Hollywood Squares.'' 
 By JEAN OPPENHEIMER  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    Growing up in New York's Chelsea housing project, Caryn Johnson
harbored very specific dreams.
 &HT;    She wanted to be a professional actress _ and win an Academy
Award, of course. She wanted to get to know the magnetically
handsome stage and screen star Frank Langella. And she wanted to
meet the president of the United States.
 &HT;    Thirty years later Johnson, now known as Whoopi Goldberg, has
achieved all three _ and then some. A star of both stage and
screen, winner of a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for 1990's
``Ghost,'' she hobnobs with the Clintons and has been romantically
involved with Langella for two years.
 &HT;    Speaking by telephone from her home in New York, the actress
reports that she still has ambitions galore _ but, she admits,
``it's nice to be able to check things off the list.''
 &HT;    Appearing on a television game show may or may not have been one
of those childhood ambitions, but if so, she can cross that one
off. Goldberg is currently starring in _ and executive producing _
the latest revival of ``Hollywood Squares,'' the popular show which
ran from 1966 to 1980 and again from 1986 to 1989.
 &HT;    ``Hollywood Squares'' is basically a giant tic-tac-toe game.
Celebrity guests appear in the board's nine squares, while two
contestants earn their Xs and Os by declaring whether a celebrity
has correctly answered a given question.
 &HT;    Goldberg will be the show's only regular, appearing in the
center square and following in the footsteps of Paul Lynde, during
the show's initial run, and Joan Rivers, during the syndicated
version in the late 1980s.
 &HT;    The actress, who recently graced Broadway in ``A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the Forum'' and has appeared in more than 30
feature films, insists she's not out of place in a televised game
show.
 &HT;    ``When `Hollywood Squares' first went on the air,'' she says,
``there was a very clear delineation between performers who did
television and those who did movies. You didn't see movie stars
doing a lot of TV back then, and when stars did do TV it was
assumed there was something wrong in their careers.
 &HT;    ``But today,'' she says, ``with me, Helen Hunt, Glenn Close and
others going back and forth quite easily between film and
television, that line has been erased.''
 &HT;    The show's guest list would seem to bear that out: Robin
Williams, Billy Crystal and Sharon Stone are all scheduled to
appear. Political spinmeister James Carville is also on tap, and
Rosie O'Donnell occupied one of the first week's squares.
 &HT;    The 42-year-old Goldberg reached the center square by a
roundabout route. Though she came to public attention as a
comedian, her first love was acting, which she pursued in New York,
Berkeley, Calif., and San Diego. She was 27 when producer/director
Mike Nichols caught her one-woman show in San Francisco, and
brought it to Broadway in 1984.
 &HT;    There Steven Spielberg saw her, and cast her in ``The Color
Purple'' (1985). That kicked off a film career which has included
``Ghost,'' ``Sister Act'' (1992), ``Corrina, Corrina'' (1994),
``Bogus'' (1995) and the recent ``How Stella Got Her Groove Back.''
She also appeared on the television series ``Star Trek: The Next
Generation'' and the short-lived ``Bagdad Cafe.''
 &HT;    She's had more than her share of box-office flops among the
hits, but Goldberg insists that she has few regrets.
 &HT;    ``I don't think I've made too many errors,'' she snaps.
 &HT;    If Goldberg seems testy, perhaps it's the early hour _ 9 a.m. _
or perhaps it's her problematic history with the press.
 &HT;    ``You want to keep a private life,'' she says. ``People say,
`This is what you bought into,' but that's not true. I bought into
being a person on a screen who chooses what information they want
to put out. Today you no longer have that choice. And if someone
wants to ruin you, all they have to do is make an innuendo.''
 &HT;    The actress is particularly upset about a 1997 article in New
York magazine, which claimed that Goldberg had admitted fabricating
stories about her past.
 &HT;    ``There is no reason to lie about yourself, particularly if you
have been upfront all the way through,'' she says. ``I had simply
told the reporter that I didn't want to talk about it because I had
talked about it endlessly ... I just didn't want to rehash it. She
didn't like my answer and, instead of saying the boring thing, she
intimated that I was trying to alter my past.''
 &HT;    So no, Goldberg says, she never denied having used heroin as a
teen-ager, dropped out of high school or been on welfare for a
while.
 &HT;    ``They are probably not the best things I could have done, but I
did them,'' she says. ``That doesn't mean other people should do
them. I survived where a lot of other people didn't.''
 &HT;    As a veteran of the tabloid wars _ her 1993-94 relationship with
Ted Danson, for example, provided frequent headlines _ Goldberg
sympathizes with the current ordeal of her friend, President
Clinton.
 &HT;    ``I think the media and some of the folks in office have lost
their minds,'' she says. ``It's not like he's the Dalai Lama and
was born into the job _ he's a regular guy with flaws. I live in a
glass house, and it's very hard for me to understand how it is
immoral to have a sexual relationship with another willing person _
and that is the operative word, `willing.'
 &HT;    ``We hold them up to moral standards that we ourselves couldn't
stand up to,'' Goldberg continues. ``We have to figure out what it
is we want: Do we want a god or a president?
 &HT;    ``I don't think there is a Republican in the world who could
stand up under this kind of microscope,'' she concludes. ``The last
saint was Mother Teresa, and they are few and far between.''
 &HT;    If calls for humane tolerance sound odd coming from a comedian
who has been known for her acerbic commentary, Goldberg says that
it may be because she's mellowing.
 &HT;    ``I think I am becoming more compassionate,'' she admits. ``I
understand a lot more, the older I get. I see that things aren't
black or white. It isn't always easy to accept, and it isn't easy
to say to someone, `Look, I was wrong about that and I'm really
sorry.'
 &HT;    ``It makes life so much easier if you can cop to the mistakes
and say, `Well, this is how I looked at it, but maybe this isn't
the way I need to deliver it to you. Maybe I could talk to you
about it in a way that doesn't require anyone becoming combative in
their response.'''
 &HT;    She may be settling down emotionally, but physically Goldberg is
as up in the air as ever. Or, rather, down to earth, since she's
afraid of flying and goes everywhere by bus. This is particularly
hard on her relationship with Langella, since he remains tied to
the New York stage while she has to tape ``Hollywood Squares'' in
Los Angeles.
 &HT;    She tapes on Saturday and Sunday, the actress reports, then
leaves California Sunday night. She arrives in New York 48 hours
later, and two days later she is back on the bus, heading west.
 &HT;    It's still worth it, she says of the relationship which began in
1996 when the two appeared together in the basketball movie,
``Eddie.''
 &HT;    ``It is good and fun, and we are still together,'' she says
simply. ``And I am very happy.''
 &HT;    Actually, the grandmother of two says, she's pretty happy about
everything in her life.
 &HT;    ``I'm lucky,'' she says. ``I was raised to believe I could do
anything if I was willing to accept the fact that not everyone was
going to like it or be accepting of it. And to believe that that
was OK.''

 Includes a color slide of Jenna Elfman in a scene from ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg.'' 
 By DAVID KRONKE  
 c.1998 Canadian TV Guide  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Last year ABC's prime-time lineup took more casualties than Tom
Hanks' unit did in ``Saving Private Ryan.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, once the critics, the viewers and _ most ominously _
the Nielsens had had their say, the only two people left standing
were Jenna Elfman and Thomas Gibson, the stars of ``Dharma &AMP;
Greg,'' the hit saga of free-spirited sprite Dharma Finklestein and
her husband, buttoned-down attorney Greg.
</P>
<P>
   As lighthearted as her television character may be, Elfman
proves to be just as much so. She refuses all opportunities to act
like a star. Why, she won't even hire a bodyguard or whine about
the paparazzi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's the thing: I am responsible for my own condition,'' she
says. ``You don't blame your dad or your second-grade teacher. If
things were done to you, you made it OK for them to do those
things. I'm the one who's playing the game. The more you try to
protect, the more people get to you. If they see you with a
bodyguard, they think there must be something wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Stardom is still new to Elfman, whose previous career high was
``Townies,'' a 1996 sitcom that flopped ignominiously.
Nevertheless, she caught the eye of network execs, and before long
industry observers were predicting ``Dharma &AMP; Greg'' would be a
smash _ months before it ever hit the air.
</P>
<P>
   ``My take was, `Oh, well, good, if it'll help people watch,'''
she says. ``It was flattering. With `Townies,' I was not ready to
be a star. It was good to be noticed. The self-esteem thing, I can
pull off. I'm willing to fail _ it's going to get you eventually.''
</P>
<P>
   Elfman says her audition for the part helped shape some of the
mannerisms and traits that have subsequently turned up in Dharma.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see things showing up in scripts that I had done that had
worked,'' she says. ``It has evolved through rehearsal, evolved
through the scripts. I really don't need to have much input _
they're so good, I don't need to have something to say. Everyone
lets everyone wear their hat.''
</P>
<P>
   By all accounts, the search for an actor who could hold his own
against Elfman's flights of fancy was a difficult one for
co-creators Chuck Lorre and Dotty Dartland until Gibson took off
his ``Chicago Hope'' scrubs and entered the picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the other guys had one thing,'' Elfman recalls. ``One guy
was so hysterical, but there was no chemistry, he could have been
my brother. Others were so handsome, but had no sense of humor _
not good.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thomas has so much charm,'' she says. ``Chuck and Dotty said,
`If we're OK watching him kiss you, then he's the one.' The
chemistry was there.''
</P>
<P>
   Both performers understand how well they complement one another.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, Dharma's the wacky one, so he has to be straight,''
she says. ``Thomas realizes that's his role, but he's had some
episodes where he got to be goofy and I got to be the straight man.
We both know our roles in the show _ I'm not funny without a
straight man, and he's not charming without the wacko.''
</P>
<P>
   Elfman is delighted by the positive message ``Dharma &AMP; Greg''
sends its viewers, simply in portraying a happy marriage _ rare in
sitcomland.
</P>
<P>
   ``You should set an example if you're on TV,'' she says. ``In
every living room, you should be trying to lift people's spirits.''
</P>
<P>
   Her current exuberance notwithstanding, there were plenty of
times along the way when Elfman's spirits needed lifting. Her
initially promising career as a dancer was ultimately ruined by a
chronic ankle injury she had suffered at the age of 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more I iced it, the less I danced,'' she recalls. ``I
wanted to do my career, not sit on the sidelines. It was like being
in a playpen in the window, watching your brother and sister play
outside. There's nothing worse for me. When I'm all dressed up and
someone cancels on me, I'm never more crazy.''
</P>
<P>
   A mere eight years ago, Elfman says, she was the polar opposite
of her current sunshiny self.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a dancer who didn't want to dance,'' she says. ``It
wasn't going to happen. I wasn't sure of myself as an actress, with
guys, as a person. If I had friends who were successful, I'd feel
even less successful than I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Can't picture it? Wait for Ron Howard's upcoming film,
``Ed-TV,'' in which Elfman plays just such a character.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't her first film. She appeared in bit parts in ``Grosse
Pointe Blank'' (1997) and ``Can't Hardly Wait'' (1998), contributed
the voice of the Owl in the summer smash ``Dr. Dolittle'' and
carried on cheerfully through the spring dud ``Krippendorf's
Tribe'' _ ``a huge growing experience, and I was proud to be part
of it,'' she says chirpily.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Ed-TV'' will mark her first effort as a serious film
actress.
</P>
<P>
   ``With `Ed-TV' I finally got to put on the tool belt as an
actress, and put everything I learned into it,'' she says proudly.
</P>
<P>
   In the film, to be released next year, Elfman plays Shari, an
insecure young woman who finds herself dating Ed (Matthew
McConaughey), the star of his own round-the-clock television show.
Think ``The Truman Show,'' only with Truman liking all the
attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the voice of sanity, disagreeing with this phenomenon,
while everyone else is in full agreement,'' Elfman explains. ``This
movie shows how people glob into agreement _ if others are
agreeing, then it must be so. That's insanity. Shari is the only
one disagreeing.''
</P>
<P>
   Shari's lack of self-confidence rang a bell with Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had more of that side to me a while ago,'' she says. ``It
was fun to be able to play that, since I understand it now, I can
live it fully and it's better for the movie. The happier I get or
more certain, the easier it is to play the other side, because I'm
not in it as much, where you can't see the forest for the trees.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson likewise did some moonlighting over the summer, taking a
part in Stanley Kubrick's marathon production, ``Eyes Wide Shut.''
The highest number of takes for a single scene demanded by the
legendarily obsessive, perfectionist director? A mere 50-something,
Elfman reports, considerably fewer than the 80 or more that stars
Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman often found themselves grinding out.
</P>
<P>
   Her husband, Bodhi Elfman, also hit the big screen over the
summer, with a small part in ``Armageddon.'' Bodhi was also cast
for, then fired from, Fox's troubled series ``Hollyweird.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's why a sense of humor is good, so you don't crumble at
the sight of TV executives,'' Elfman says sunnily.
</P>
<P>
   This year on ``Dharma &AMP; Greg,'' the couple will adopt a child.
Though Elfman in the past has enthused about the idea of having her
own children, she's currently a bit more circumspect.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never the right time,'' she says with a sigh. ``When it
does come, it will be the most beautiful thing, it will change our
life hugely for the good. It all sounds good to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to not be there _ though, if I'm at work but my
mind is on the kids, I don't want that,'' Elfman says. ``I have a
film career to consider, too. I don't want to be a parent and an
actress half-assed.''

STANLEY TUCCI TAKES A FLING AT FARCE

 Includes a color slide of Stanley Tucci and Oliver Platt in a scene
from ``The Impostors.'' 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    His career may be catching fire, but Stanley Tucci isn't
catching anything.
 &HT;    ``I went fishing with my dad this morning and, as usual, we
caught nothing,'' Tucci says, his laughter reverberating over the
telephone from his home in Westchester County, N.Y. ``I said,
`Thank God we didn't try to do this for a living, because we'd have
starved to death years ago.'''
 &HT;    Fortunately for Tucci, he got through the last 15 years as a
familiar character actor on television and in films. And, of late,
he's had far bigger fish to fry as the
writer/director/producer/star of his own movies.
 &HT;    Tucci earned acclaim and scored a modest box-office hit in 1996
as the co-writer/co-producer/co-director/co-star of the
food-loose-and-fancy-free comedy/drama ``Big Night,'' and on Oct. 2
he returns to the big screen with ``The Impostors.''
 &HT;    Set in the 1930s, during the Great Depression, ``The Impostors''
stars Tucci and Oliver Platt as unemployed actors whose drunken
mockery of a famous thespian (Alfred Molina) launches them on the
adventure of their lives.
 &HT;    They wind up on a cruise ship, enmeshed in a cheerfully insane
plot. A variety of independent-film stalwarts _ Steve Buscemi,
Billy Connolly, Lili Taylor, Campbell Scott, Dana Ivey, Hope Davis
and Tony Shalhoub _ turn up along the way.
 &HT;    ``I'd always wanted to put a farce on film, and one of the
reasons I wanted to try that was that people said, `You can't do
that. It doesn't work,''' Tucci says. ``When I tried to get the
money for the movie, everybody said that.
 &HT;    ``I also wanted to work with this group of actors,'' he adds.
``and wanted to write roles for them that they'd never played
before, to show people different sides of them that I know.
 &HT;    ``They're all so versatile, and they're the nicest people you'd
ever want to meet,'' Tucci says with real affection. ``They took
the gamble with me on `Big Night,' and I asked them to take another
gamble here.''
 &HT;    ``The Impostors'' will likely face greater expectations than
``Big Night,'' which caught audiences by surprise. More eyes are on
Tucci this time around, and he knows it.
 &HT;    ``While making the movie I wasn't nervous, but I started to get
a little nervous in the editing room, during test screenings,'' he
admits. ``It took a little while to make use of the test screenings
and to let go of the fact that `Impostors' was my sophomore effort
and that people would scrutinize it more.
 &HT;    ``It took awhile to say, `I've made the movie I wanted to make,
without compromise,''' he says. ``That's all there is to it, but
that's a very difficult thing to do.
 &HT;    ``You can't second-guess yourself, and you can't pander or cater
to an audience.''
 &HT;    When ``Big Night'' achieved sleeper status, people wondered
``Who the heck is Stanley Tucci?'' and ``Where'd he come from?''
Nowadays, more people are likely to know the answers.
 &HT;    ``Before `Big Night' I'd done about 25 movies and more than 100
episodes of television series,'' says Tucci, who was born and
reared in Katonah, N.Y., and attended college at SUNY/Purchase. ``I
did an extended arc (as a charming killer) on `Murder One' that got
a lot of attention. That and `Big Night' put me up on another
level.
 &HT;    ``The visibility was so high on both projects, and they were
very different roles and projects,'' he says. ``Millions of people
saw `Murder One,' and `Big Night' crossed over and became a very
talked-about film.
 &HT;    ``The combination of `Big Night' and `Murder One' changed
everything for me.''
 &HT;    ``Big Night' enabled Tucci to give free rein to his inner
control freak.
 &HT;    ``It wasn't until I started writing `Big Night' that it hit me
that all I was looking for, really, was control of my life, and I
didn't have that as an actor,'' he says. ``I was at the mercy of
God knows who.
 &HT;    ``Also, as an actor, I always felt like I languished between
films,'' he says. ``I did everything I could to stay alive
creatively _ I painted and drew and read, whatever _ and I still
wasn't satisfied.
 &HT;    ``Writing and directing, while difficult, are enormously
satisfying.''
 &HT;    Of course, many an actor aspires to write and direct, but few
succeed. Tucci doesn't take anything for granted, but he feels that
he's earned his success.
 &HT;    ``I certainly feel lucky, but I have to say it came out of hard
work,'' he says. ```Big Night' did not just happen. We all worked
very hard to make that film, and it took a long, long time.
 &HT;    ``We didn't compromise our vision,'' he adds, ``and I can't
begin to tell you how glad I am that our vision was so liked by so
many.''
 &HT;    While Tucci waits to see if ``Impostors'' meets a similar
reception, he's put his actor hat back on. He'll appear as a con
artist in a whodunit entitled ``The Alarmist,'' which features Kate
Capshaw and David Arquette and will open in limited release
throughout October and November, and star as the late
journalist/radio commentator Walter Winchell in ``Winchell,'' a
made-for-cable movie airing in late November on HBO.
 &HT;    In what definitely will represent a change of pace, the actor is
also to be seen as Puck in director Michael Hoffman's big-screen
version of Shakespeare's ``A Midsummer Night's Dream.'' His
co-stars include Kevin Kline, Michelle Pfeiffer and Calista
Flockheart.
 &HT;    Tucci's previous films run the gamut from high-profile Hollywood
productions such as ``The Pelican Brief'' (1993), ``It Could Happen
to You'' (1994) and ``Kiss of Death'' (1995) to indie fare such as
``In the Soup'' (1992), ``Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle''
(1994) and ``The Daytrippers'' (1996).
 &HT;    Unlike many laborers in the indie vineyards, Tucci has nothing
bad to say about mainstream films or the people who make them.
 &HT;    ``Some big movies I really love,'' Tucci says. ``I love the
scope of things like the James Bond movies.
 &HT;    ``As an actor, bigger films are fun,'' he adds. ``You get paid.
You often get to work with great people, and sometimes you get to
do a role that's really interesting.
 &HT;    ``It's nice to be able to taste both worlds,'' Tucci says.
``Listen, people give indie actors a lot of s--t about doing a big
movie, and it's really unfortunate.''
 &HT;    Actors, Tucci argues, need roofs over their heads as much as
anyone else does.
 &HT;    ``If you worked for scale all the time on independent films, you
couldn't make a living,'' he says forcefully. ``If you want to have
a family and send a kid to college, forget about it. If you make
scale on four independent features, people may say, `Hey, you're
working all the time,' but you're probably broke.
 &HT;    ``People think actors in movies are getting rich somehow,'' he
concludes. ``Sometimes it's true, but sometimes it's not.''
 &HT;    Tucci recently finished the script for his next directing
effort, ``Joe Gould's Secret,'' based on magazine articles written
by Joseph Mitchell for The New Yorker. Casting will begin soon, and
Tucci expects to shoot the picture as early as January.
 &HT;    ``I'm panicking because I have some time off between now and
then,'' says Tucci, who's 38 and married. ``Steve Buscemi said to
me, earlier today, `Just enjoy it.' But it's weird.
 &HT;    ``I've been working, working, working for two straight years,
and all I wanted was a break,'' the actor/director says, laughing.
``Now I've got a break, and I don't know what to do with myself.
 &HT;    ``I feel so ... unemployed.''
 &HT;    Fishing, anyone?

DEMOCRATS SLAM TAPE'S RELEASE WHILE REPUBLICANS TALK IMPEACHMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ While some congressional Democrats criticized
Monday's release of the videotape of President Clinton's grand jury
testimony as partisan warfare, Republicans said it showed the
president lying under oath and could provide grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Four hours of unedited videotape of Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony
detailing his relationship with Monica Lewinsky was broadcast
nationally Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Minority Leader Thomas A. Daschle, D-S.D., the House
Judiciary Committee's decision to release the tape as ``very
partisan.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we would show more nonpartisanship that was
pledged,'' Daschle said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Conyers Jr., ranking Democrat on the Judiciary
Committee, denounced the release of ``irrelevant, unnecessary
disclosure of salacious and lurid details'' meant to embarrass the
president.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said it would have been more
appropriate to release the tape after the Judiciary Committee had
finished its inquiry into allegations that the president committed
perjury, abused his power and sought to obstruct justice in
covering up the Lewinsky affair.
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi called the release of the videotape ``a blatant political
move on the part of the Republican leadership in the House to
further humiliate the president over an affair that he has already
admitted.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What President Clinton did was wrong,'' Pelosi added. ``It is
grounds for embarrassment, not for impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Judiciary Committee voted Friday to release the tape and
2,800 pages of documents despite strong opposition from Democrats
on the committee. The vote came a week after the House released
independent counsel Kenneth Starr's report detailing the
allegations that Clinton committed impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Michael McCurry blamed the release on
``rank partisanship,'' and said most of the material being made
public was irrelevant.
</P>
<P>
   ``That the president's conduct does not rise to the level of an
impeachable offense should now be clear to everyone,'' McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Republican members of the Judiciary Committee, which will
recommend to the House whether Clinton should be impeached, gave a
harsher review of the videotape and its possible repercussions.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, said the videotape ``showed the
president doing what he does best, being a very smooth talker.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith said some parts of the tape ``do not put the president in
a good light'' because ``they do show him avoiding answering
questions and show him giving answers that are long and
irrelevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton read a statement describing his relationship with
Lewinsky as involving ``sexual banter'' and ``inappropriate
intimate contact,'' but refused to go into further detail. At one
point, when asked directly if he had had oral sex with Lewinsky,
Clinton declined to answer.
</P>
<P>
   Smith said the tape also shows the president suspected it might
be made public because most of his responses sound like ``he was
giving a political speech, rather than answering questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith defended the committee's decision to make public Clinton's
testimony, saying ``I assume it's always better to give people the
most complete picture possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Another Republican on the panel, Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla.,
said if it is determined Clinton lied under oath, he should be
removed from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe if the president lied under oath, that is an
impeachable offense,'' Canady said. ``If he commits perjury before
a grand jury he has violated his oath and he has breached his duty
under the Constitution, and I believe that justifies impeachment.''
</P>
<P>
   The president ``understands the obligation to tell the truth and
the whole truth,'' Canady said. ``And we'll have to make a judgment
about whether he has done that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James E. Rogan, R-Calif., a former judge who is also a
member of the judiciary panel, was more reserved.
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said he was ``disturbed'' by the videotape, but said the
panel has an obligation to ``still give him (Clinton) the benefit
of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a former U.S. attorney
who has repeatedly called for the impeachment of the president,
said the videotape showed Clinton committing a felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``After viewing this videotape, no reasonable person could
conclude that the president did not knowingly lie to the grand jury
to the court in the underlying lawsuit,'' said Barr, another member
of the Judiciary panel. ``This is a classic case of perjury.''

<P>
   When many science fans last tuned in, physicists in search of
the universe's deepest secrets were pinning their hopes on a
dazzlingly beautiful and bewildering invention called superstring
theory. The ultimate explanation of nature would finally come
together, it was promised, if one thought of the hundreds of
subatomic particles as musical notes produced by incredibly tiny
strings vibrating in a realm made of 10 dimensions. Never mind that
the universe seems to be made of only four dimensions (counting
time). The other six were said to be conveniently curled up into
vanishingly tiny balls, out of sight and mind.
</P>
<P>
   Since its quiet beginnings in the 1960s, the idea has flared and
faded through a first ``superstring revolution'' in the mid-1980s
and a second revolution a decade later. In recent months, a new
wave of discoveries is fomenting what some physicists are excitedly
hailing as a third revolution, leading toward a day when all the
laws of creation may fit into a single, elegant frame.
</P>
<P>
   But the subject of the latest enthusiasm is not called
superstring theory anymore. Along the way, the name has changed to
M theory, with the M standing for ``magic,'' ``mystery,''
``mother'' (as in mother of all theories) or, more prosaically,
``meta,'' ``matrix'' or ``membrane.'' For the wiggling
superstrings, which were at least vaguely possible to visualize,
have been joined (and possibly supplanted) by even more abstract
entities: membranes, or ``branes,'' which come in as many as nine
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   All of creation, according to some recent speculation, may be
concocted from these barely imaginable objects: God's Tinkertoys.
If this realization is correct, then physics may be closer than
ever to writing down the elusive theory of quantum gravity, a feat
that would unify quantum mechanics and general relativity _ the two
hitherto irreconcilable pillars of modern physics _and explain all
the forces of nature in the same terms.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are going to look back on this as one of the most
important periods in 20th-century physics, as significant as the
development of quantum mechanics and relativity,'' predicted John
Schwarz, a physicist at the California Institute of Technology and
an early pioneer of string theory.
</P>
<P>
   Enthusiastic pronouncements from the string theorists themselves
are nothing new. But the excitement is also leaking into other
domains, like cosmology.
</P>
<P>
   Andrew Strominger, a Harvard University physicist who recently
used M theory to leap across disciplines and solve a problem
involving black holes, said: ``We were once considered
semi-crackpots working on some bizarre idea. While that may still
be true, at least we're no longer perceived that way.''
</P>
<P>
   One evening this past summer at the annual superstring fiesta,
Strings '98, in Santa Barbara, Calif., some 200 physicists heralded
the latest developments by dancing the Macarena, or, rather, a new
version called the Maldacena, named after a young Argentine
theorist, Juan Maldacena of Harvard University whose new theory is
the source of the latest excitement:
</P>
<P>
   You start with the brane
</P>
<P>
   and the brane is BPS.
</P>
<P>
   Then you go near the brane
</P>
<P>
   and the space is ADS.
</P>
<P>
   Who knows what it means
</P>
<P>
   I don't, I confess
</P>
<P>
   Ehhhh! Maldacena!
</P>
<P>
   As Jeffrey Harvey, a University of Chicago theorist, rapped out
the lyrics, one esoteric verse piling on top of another, the
physicists worked their way through the 14 steps of the dance.
</P>
<P>
   What the message came down to was this: Physicists have a very
successful framework called quantum field theory that describes
three of the four forces. The strong force holds the atomic nucleus
together; the weak force governs radioactive processes, and good
old electromagnetism combines electrical and magnetic effects. All
three can be portrayed as fields transmitted by particles called
quanta. For electromagnetism the carriers are photons, for the
strong force gluons, and for the weak force W and Z particles. But
no one has been able to fit gravity into the picture. It is assumed
that the force must be carried by particles called gravitons, but
getting these to obey the laws of quantum field theory has proved
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Gravity can be described, however, by superstring theory, or M
theory, using the completely different vocabulary of strings and
branes. Maldacena's conjecture, elaborated in an explosion of more
than a hundred recent papers by superstring theorists, suggests the
possibility of a deep, hidden connection between quantum field
theory and string theory, these two seemingly immiscible
worldviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very dramatic claim,'' said Nathan Seiberg, a
theorist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. In
addition to bringing gravity and the other forces closer together,
the tentative links Maldacena has found may provide a powerful new
calculational tool for solving difficult problems in particle
physics.

</P>
<P>
   THE ORIGIN: NEW VISION FOR A QUANDARY
</P>
<P>
   String theory first arose in the late 1960s and early '70s as an
ill-fated attempt to understand the strong force. Parsing the world
in terms of particles and fields had already led to a spectacularly
successful theory of electromagnetism, and the weak nuclear force
was on the verge of succumbing to a similar explanation.
</P>
<P>
   But the strong force seemed, at the time, stubbornly resistant.
Some physicists were taking this as a sign that field theory needed
to be scrapped and replaced with a whole new vision. What emerged
was the possibility that particles were really different notes
produced by vibrating strings.
</P>
<P>
   The potential payoffs seemed immense. One big problem of dealing
with the infinitesimally small particles of quantum field theory
was that they caused mathematical absurdities to pop up in the
equations, like trying to divide a number by zero. The result was
infinite terms that rendered the calculations nonsensical. The
problem, which had been solved for electromagnetism, crippled
attempts to explain the strong force. If sizeless particles were
replaced by little strings, the mavericks proposed, maybe the
cancerous infinities would go away.
</P>
<P>
   But there were many problems to overcome. If one could believe
the equations, the strings would have to be vibrating in a space of
25 dimensions (with a 26th representing time). Where were the extra
22? The equations also kept coughing up a weird massless particle
whose spin (a quantum mechanical analogue of rotation) was 2. The
only such particle anyone knew about was the purely hypothetical
graviton. If physicists ever succeeded in devising a quantum field
theory of gravity, the graviton would be the carrier. But what was
it doing in a theory of the strong force?
</P>
<P>
   In any event, physicists soon succeeded in explaining the strong
force with a field theory called quantum chromodynamics, and most
theorists turned their backs on strings. According to quantum
chromodynamics, or QCD, elemental building blocks called quarks
come in three ``colors'' (somewhat analogous to electrical charge).
The quarks are bound together by gluons, the carriers of the strong
force, to form protons, neutrons, and their subatomic kin. By the
end of the '70s, QCD had been incorporated into the Standard Model,
an amalgam of quantum field theories describing the strong force,
the weak force and electromagnetism. The most daring theorists were
trying for a ``grand unified theory'' in which all three forces
were shown to manifestations of a single superforce. But gravity
remained far out of the game.
</P>
<P>
   THE REVOLUTION: TYING IN GRAVITY WITH SUPERSTRINGS
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone gave up on strings. In the mid-1970s, two
physicists, Schwarz and Joel Scherk, tried to turn one of string
theory's flaws into a virtue: Maybe the persistent appearance of
the graviton in the equations was no accident. Maybe what they were
looking at was not a model of the strong force, but a model of
gravity _ a new way to formulate Einstein's general theory of
relativity. And if gravity could be described by string theory,
then maybe the other forces could also be reformulated this way.
All would then be unified into the same package.
</P>
<P>
   Around this time, string theorists found they could pare the 26
space-time dimensions required by the original theory to a mere 10.
Along the way, the theory came to be called superstrings when it
was endowed with a hypothetical quality called supersymmetry, in
which the force-carrying particles like gluons and the
matter-making particles like quarks are closely knit together.
</P>
<P>
   Ten dimensions were still a lot to swallow. And, in an
embarrassment of riches, it appeared that one could potentially
construct an infinite number of different 10-dimensional string
theories. How would one ever know which one described this
universe? A breakthrough came in the mid-1980s when, in the first
revolution, it was shown that of all possible string theories, only
five were mathematically sturdy; the rest would come crashing down
because of various inconsistencies. But this was still four
theories too many. Even worse, there were still tens of thousands
of different ways to roll up the six extraneous dimensions to get
the theories to describe a four-dimensional world.
</P>
<P>
   A small band of die-hards remained excited. Edward Witten, a
rising young star of string theory, romantically described it as
``a piece of 21st-century physics that fell by chance into the 20th
century.''
</P>
<P>
   String theorists quietly toiling away until the second
revolution of the mid-'90s. The many ways to hide the extra
dimensions were found to be related. And the five 10-dimensional
theories turned out to be just different views of a single
underlying 11-dimensional theory. All could be connected by
``dualities,'' mathematical lenses through which the seemingly
different turn out to be the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds me of the story of the blind people examining the
elephant,'' said Seiberg, the theorist at Princeton. ``We used to
look at different pieces and did not see the big picture.''

   In funneling the plenitude of theories into one, physicists
realized that their equations spoke of a world made not just from
strings but also from membranous things called p-branes, with the p
standing for the number of dimensions. What is normally thought of
as a membrane is a two-dimensional surface, like a bedsheet,
stretching across a three-dimensional space. This is now called a
2-brane. A point is a 0-brane, and a line is a 1-brane. Extending
the idea in the other direction, one can have 3-branes, 4-branes,
5-branes, all the way up to 9-branes: nine-dimensional surfaces
flapping inside a 10-dimensional world.
</P>
<P>
   Especially important to M theory is a special type called a
D-brane, named for the 19th-century mathematician Peter Dirichlet.
In 1995 Joseph Polchinsky of the University of California at Santa
Barbara showed that D-branes, which also come in as many as nine
dimensions, described surfaces on which strings can end. But these
surfaces are more than mere boundaries: D-branes are now seen as
entities at least as fundamental as strings. According to a
controversial version of M theory called Matrix theory, D-branes
may be the fundamental objects from which strings and everything
else is made.
</P>
<P>
   Before long physicists like Strominger, the Harvard physicist,
were finding that some of the puzzles about black holes could be
better understood if they were thought of as being made from
D-branes. In fact, D-branes themselves could be conceived of as
extremely tiny black holes. A string came to an end because the
rest of it was sucked down one of these infinitesimal wells. A
closed string, shaped like a loop, became an open, two-ended string
when a chunk of it was bitten off by a D-brane.
</P>
<P>
   And D-branes are an essential part of the choreography of the
mathematical dance called the Maldacena, in which string theory and
field theory pirouette on the same floor. Maldacena, the
Argentine-born physicist at Harvard, used D-branes to construct a
quantum field theory similar to QCD, in the ordinary four
dimensions. Meanwhile he also used D-branes to build a
10-dimensional string theory (with five of the dimensions curled up
and hidden away). By their nature string theories include gravity.
Thus the excitement when Maldacena showed that the two theories
were intimately related. The unification of all four forces may now
be a step closer to realization.
</P>
<P>
   THE UNIVERSE: LINKING INNER SPACE TO OUTER SPACE
</P>
<P>
   But the finding is still just a conjecture, lingering in the
netherworld between hunches and fully developed theories. To get
his model to work, Maldacena had to pull some clever theoretical
tricks. In QCD, quarks come in three ``colors.'' Drawing on an idea
from the Dutch physicist Gerard 't Hooft, he simplified the
calculations by using a toy theory with many more colors.
</P>
<P>
   And so far, the connection Maldacena found only works in
something called anti-de Sitter space (after the Dutch astronomer
Willem de Sitter). An anti-de Sitter universe would be ``curved''
in such a manner that the expansion from the big bang would
gradually decelerate and collapse into a big crunch. Recent
evidence hints that in our own universe the expansion may be
eternally accelerating. But that is far from certain.
</P>
<P>
   Taking into account these qualifications, the bottom line of the
Maldacena conjecture is this: The curvature of the space-time
described by the string theory is equivalent to the number of
colors in the field theory; more colors mean less curvature. An
unexpected bridge may have been found between two different
theoretical worlds.
</P>
<P>
   Physicists are now trying to extend the work so it applies to
space-times with positive curvature and to a field theory more like
the actual QCD. Strominger of Harvard, for one, is betting that the
relationship will be found to hold across the board, showing that
``string theory and quantum field theory are just two sides of the
same coin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not at the bottom of it yet,'' he said. ``We're all in a
good mood because we think there is a lot more to be learned.''
</P>
<P>
   Maldacena's work also supports a hot new theory that the
universe is holographic. In laser holography, a three-dimensional
object is projected onto a two-dimensional plane, retaining the
richness of the original image. In the Maldacena model, the
four-dimensional field theory can be thought of as a holographic
projection of the five-dimensional string theory (remember that the
other five dimensions are rolled up and tucked away). In a
holographic universe, the information about everything in a volume
of space would be displayed somehow on its surface. The bizarre
implications of this notion are only beginning to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   THE MEANING: JUST FANCY MATH, OR REAL SCIENCE?
</P>
<P>
   Maldacena concedes that his conjecture is burdened with the
criticism that applies to all of M theory: that it cannot yet be
tested by experiment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, all that has been done is mostly from the
conceptual point of view,'' he said. ``There are no experimental
predictions so far, but hopefully there will be in the future. We
don't know whether that will happen soon or not. How far you can
extend a new method is a question that is always hard to answer.''
</P>
<P>
   Some physicists still maintain that for all the conceptual
revolutions in string theory, there is little to show but a lot of
beautiful mathematics.
</P>
<P>
   ``No observable physical phenomena have been explained,'' said
't Hooft, the Dutch physicist. ``So it is tempting to be sarcastic
about these developments.''
</P>
<P>
   And even M theory's enthusiasts are baffled by what it all
really means.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the second superstring revolution, life was simple,''
said Steven Giddings, a theorist at the University of California at
Santa Barbara. ``We believed that everything in the universe,
quarks, photons, gravitons, electrons, and the rest, were all made
out of strings. The recent upheaval has shattered that view, and
we've yet to find a convincing logical structure to replace it.''
</P>
<P>
   Giddings continued: ``We no longer know what the fundamental
constituents of the theory are. Strings and D-branes appear equally
fundamental, and it's not clear whether either one of them is made
out of the other. Perhaps they're all made from something even more
fundamental. It's like climbing a mountain to reach the top and
discovering that it's just a foothill to a more distant range.
We've made an enormous amount of progress in the past few years,
but now realize the greater depth of our ignorance.''
</P>
<P>
   He was leaving that day, for a peak in the Sierras, to do
something he considered easy: climbing a thousand-foot wall of
vertical ice.

`SIR VIDIA'S SHADOW': SOME POISON ARROWS MARKED `RETURN TO
SENDER'  
(PUBLICATION NOTES AT END) 
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MICHIKO KAKUTANI    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The writers V.S. Naipaul and Paul Theroux had a long, mutually
sustaining friendship that began in 1966 in Uganda and ended three
decades later in London, when Naipaul (apparently angered by an
exchange between his new wife and Theroux) reportedly snubbed
Theroux in the street, coldly telling him to ``take it on the chin
and move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Theroux's reaction to the end of a 31-year friendship was
peculiar to say the least: within minutes he began thinking about
writing a book about his former mentor and friend. He had long
wanted to write such a book, he recalls, but ``it was impossible''
because ``friendship had its rules.'' Naipaul's snub, he argues,
changed all that: ``I was dazed, because I was liberated at last,''
he writes. ``I saw how the end of a friendship was the start of an
understanding. He had made me his by choosing me; his rejection of
me meant I was on my own, out of his shadow. He had freed me, he
had opened my eyes, he had given me a subject.''
</P>
<P>
   The resulting book, ``Sir Vidia's Shadow,'' which has already
provoked considerable controversy in the literary world, is part
memoir, part biographical sketch, part effort to settle scores _ a
book, in essence, that tries to do to Naipaul what Hemingway's
mean-spirited ``Moveable Feast'' did to F. Scott Fitzgerald.
</P>
<P>
   Although ``Shadow'' begins evenhandedly enough, it finishes by
creating an acidic portrait of Naipaul as a bitter, selfish man _
occasionally generous and entertaining but more often cruel,
dismissive, bigoted, misogynistic, snobbish, arrogant and cheap. At
the same time, it is a book that unwittingly leaves the reader with
a picture of Theroux as a vindictive younger writer who evolved
from worshipful apprentice to resentful colleague, a writer who
came to see Naipaul patronizingly as ``weaker and needier'' than
himself.
</P>
<P>
   When the two met in 1966, Theroux was a 25-year-old American
teaching in Uganda; Naipaul was a 34-year-old author who had
already achieved a modicum of renown. Theroux, who desperately
hoped to become a writer himself, wanted Naipaul for a friend, and
he soon became the novelist's interpreter and guide. Naipaul, in
turn, encouraged Theroux's efforts to write, and over the years, as
the two men continued their respective peregrinations around the
world, he gave Theroux what amounted to ``a correspondence course
in creative writing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It mattered to me that he took me seriously, that he treated
me like a fellow writer,'' Theroux writes. ``No one else did, but
that did not matter, because I had him.''
</P>
<P>
   These early pages in ``Shadow,'' chronicling Theroux's
apprenticeship as a writer and his experiences in Africa, exhibit
the fierce gifts of observation that animate his finest travel
books, and they also possess an energy and density of description
missing in his more recent novels like ``O-Zone'' and ``Chicago
Loop.'' The mood, sound and feel of Africa in the 1960s are
palpably evoked, and the people Theroux meets there are conjured up
with a lively combination of journalistic detail and Dickensian
ardor.
</P>
<P>
   As for Naipaul, he emerges in these earlier portions of
``Shadow'' as both an immensely difficult man _ demanding,
impatient and petty _ and an immensely talented writer, dedicated
to his craft and ``passionate in his convictions.'' He strides
through Kampala with ``an inspector's gait,'' Theroux recalls,
pronouncing, ``We've done the market,'' ``We've done the park,''
``We've done the museum.'' He dismisses most of the whites he meets
there as ``infies'' _ that is, common, inferior sorts _ and he
grandly predicts that as soon as these outsiders leave, the country
``will go back to bush.'' He belittles the work of Orwell and
Camus, mocks the literary efforts of local African writers and
announces his dislike of children.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly many of these qualities will be familiar to people who
have met Naipaul or read articles about him. As this reviewer (who
interviewed Naipaul in 1980) discovered, the novelist not only
cheerfully admits to being a snob but also freely dispenses blunt,
even startling opinions about everything from the future of the
third world to the state of literature today _ partly out of
willful self-assurance, partly out of intolerance and partly out of
a desire to provoke.
</P>
<P>
   In this volume, however, Theroux fails to situate such
pronouncements in context with Naipaul's personal history. Theroux
repeatedly observes that his former friend felt a sense of exile,
growing up an Indian in Trinidad and spending the rest of his life
in England or on the road. But he gives only cursory attention to
how Naipaul's early acquaintance with the margins of society left
him with a profound sense of alienation and a defensive fear of
``the bush,'' and he shrugs off any effort to understand how those
emotions would shape his writing and adult life.
</P>
<P>
   Worse, ``Shadow'' gradually devolves into an angry rant that
drops all pretense of trying to create a fair or nuanced portrait
of Naipaul. As the book progresses and Theroux becomes an
established author, less accepting of his own self-appointed role
as Naipaul's ``spear carrier, flunky, gofer,'' the narrative
undergoes a change. The descriptive richness of the earlier
chapters falls away, replaced by an increasingly monotonous litany
of Naipaul's supposed sins, from failing to pick up lunch and
dinner checks to being a blatant hypocrite (i.e., denouncing
England as second rate, then accepting a knighthood) to becoming a
tedious writer.
</P>
<P>
   While Theroux demonstrates almost as few scruples as Linda Tripp
in regaling the reader with voyeuristic tidbits about Naipaul's
life _ speculating about the author's alleged fondness for
prostitutes, his reportedly sexless relationship with his first
wife and a longtime adulterous affair _ he tells the reader
precious little about his own life, alluding only in passing to the
breakup of his own marriage.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Theroux tries to reproach Naipaul for ugly
depictions of sex in his novels, arguing that ``if it is fair to
regard the passions and fantasies of a writer's characters as those
of the writer himself _ and why not? _ then I found Vidia's
observations unsettling.'' It is a remark that expresses a
shockingly naive view of fiction writing, and a remark that could
easily be used to reproach Theroux himself: after all, his 1991
novel ``Chicago Loop'' featured a hero who murders women, dresses
up in their clothes and wanders the city in search of sexual
humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   There is more. Theroux also gives the reader a recitation of
unflattering anecdotes about Naipaul that he has heard from others,
including ones he ``did not bother to verify because they had the
ring of truth.'' He cavalierly dismisses Naipaul's later work,
including such estimable books as ``The Enigma of Arrival,'' which
he describes as ``a ponderous agglomeration of the dullest rural
incidents.'' He employs broad ethnic stereotypes in an attempt to
anatomize Naipaul's flaws, describing him as ``Indian to his core _
caste conscious, race conscious, a food fanatic.'' And he suggests
that Naipaul's physical appearance _ a ``nose thickened with
anger'' and ``the blinkless gaze of a raptor'' _ has become a
mirror of an ugly personality.
</P>
<P>
   During the early days of their friendship, Theroux regarded
Naipaul as a mentor, a teacher, a role model. Perhaps Theroux
learned his lessons too well: in depicting his onetime friend as
cold, mercenary and unforgiving, he has written a cold, mercenary
and unforgiving book.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir Vidia's Shadow'' may start off as a memoir, but it ends up
as an angry, prosecutorial indictment.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Aboard first light off Montauk Point in Long Island, N.Y., Dr.
Carl Safina was edgy, drumming his fingers, glaring at the sea
through dark glasses. His boat rolled in the low waves. Sea water
sloshed and gurgled through a chum bucket, forming a trail of
chopped-up fish and an oily slick behind the boat.
</P>
<P>
   Safina scanned the horizon and glanced at his fishing rods.
Their lines trailed off into the slick. Somewhere below were 3-inch
steel hooks, which he had set with chunks of bloody fish many hours
earlier.
</P>
<P>
   The sea here once boiled with sharks. The fury provided a
semifactual basis for ``Jaws'' and a mythology about sailors and
swimmers threatened by fierce predators with razor-sharp teeth.
</P>
<P>
   But today the sharks are fewer, and catching one of the killers
can frustrate even professionals like Safina, a marine
conservationist who clearly loves the hunt but is haunted by a
vision of fishery collapse. The danger was driven home to him long
ago when he overhead a conversation in which a fisherman vowed to
catch every last tuna because no one had left him any buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
   Alarmed, Safina determined to do something about it, and in the
process became one of the world's leading exponents of fishery
restraint, a potentially lofty stance tempered by his deep
enjoyment of the catch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some days it's unbelievable,'' he said wistfully. ``You run
into fish wherever you go. Other days, it's like this, dead.''
</P>
<P>
   A dorsal fin appeared and moved back and forth slowly. Another
came closer and disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   Safina, moving quickly and silently in old sneakers, picked up a
rod and began to reel it in.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the rod bent down and the reel whined.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got one!'' he cried.
</P>
<P>
   Eleven minutes later, after a frenzy of tugging and splashing, a
blue shark more than 7 feet long darted away from the boat, freed
purposefully. The newly liberated fish bore a small metal tag
stamped with an identifying number: 234474.
</P>
<P>
   Safina is a seafood lover. His widely praised book, ``Song for
the Blue Ocean'' (Henry Holt, 1997), a survey of global fishery
problems, based on his travels, is dotted with descriptions of
restaurants and sushi bars, and of business done over plates of
grouper and giant prawns.
</P>
<P>
   He also admits to liking the taste of shark, including a big
mako he once fought for more than two hours before landing the
exhausted, 232-pound creature. (``It was incredibly good,'' he
recalled.)
</P>
<P>
   But times are changing, he said. Many varieties of sea life have
been dangerously thinned by overfishing, the monumental bad habit
of a global, multibillion-dollar industry ranging from mom-and-pop
boats to factory trawlers. Sharks are caught in the upheaval, he
said. They mature late and bear relatively few young, and
scientists fear that whole populations are under fire and might not
recover for decades, if ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love the hunt and know the thrill of the kill,'' he said,
still elated from his catch. ``But I'm not sure we should be doing
it. They need a break.''
</P>
<P>
   Tagging is another matter. Safina said the process, which is fun
for sportsmen and easy on the sharks, helps a federal program that
tracks the big predators, which turn out to migrate surprisingly
far, sometimes thousands of miles.
</P>
<P>
   To a striking degree, Safina, 43, has succeeded in turning his
ideas into action _ not only in tagging sharks off Montauk on a
summer day, but in pioneering global fishery conservation measures.
Articulate and energetic, knowledgeable and willing to take a
stand, he is something of an eco-warrior ready to fight public
indifference and lax regulators. His role has already won him many
friends and foes.
</P>
<P>
   Enemies include commercial fishermen who set long lines that can
stretch as far as 60 miles, as well as those who hunt bluefin tuna,
a giant so coveted as seafood that its breeding stocks in some
areas are seriously depleted. A single bluefin once sold for
$83,500.
</P>
<P>
   An ecologist, Safina has worked since 1979 for the National
Audubon Society. In 1990 he founded its Living Oceans marine
conservation program, which he runs. He has also taught at Yale,
written for Scientific American, testified before Congress, and
served on government fishery panels as well as international
bodies.
</P>
<P>
   From 1991 to 1994 he served on the Mid-Atlantic Fisheries
Management Council of the Department of Commerce, appointed by the
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   His wins are impressive. After he formally raised the issue of
declining shark populations with the world group that monitors
trade in endangered species, it agreed in 1994 to collect data on
sharks _ the first time it did so for a big-money fishery.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 he was a force behind the U.N. agreement to adopt a new
global standard by which fishermen on the high seas must err on the
side of caution when it comes to questions about how far fish
populations have fallen. In 1996 Congress adopted some of his ideas
in the sustainable fisheries act, which bans practices in U.S.
waters that quickly deplete stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Early this year, he worked with several environmental groups to
get swordfish off the menus at top restaurants, including ones in
Boston, New York and Washington. Commercial fishermen call such
acts extreme, saying catches have already been reduced enough to
aid the fish's recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Of late, Safina has focused on sharks. In July, a report by his
Audubon team said that, in the past two decades, populations of
large coastal sharks in the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico had dropped
as much as 85 percent and were in danger of declining further
unless states in these regions began to enact and enforce
protective regulations. In its wake, a number of states said they
would review and possibly tighten rules.
</P>
<P>
   A hallmark of Safina's activism is depth and breadth. In
researching his book, he traveled to 10 countries on four
continents. In Hong Kong he found streets lined with shops selling
shark fins, which are prized for promoting health and vigor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fractional remains of hundreds of thousands of sharks must
be moving through these markets,'' he mused in his book.
Conversations with shopkeepers suggested to him that many of the
sharks came from the Montauk area, off the eastern tip of Long
Island.
</P>
<P>
   In late July he returned to these waters, to an area he had
known intimately over the years and had worried about as catches of
all kinds of fish had declined.
</P>
<P>
   His dark hair, longish and streaked with gray, curled out from
beneath a cap. He was deeply tanned and wore no watch.
</P>
<P>
   Safina skewered a squid through a big hook and cast the bait
into the gently rolling water.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was seeing things in a way I wanted to communicate,'' he
said of his reasons for writing a book. ``I wanted lots of people
to care, so that things had a chance to change.''

SHASTA LAKE OFFERS SOME INCOMPARABLE FISHING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TOM STIENSTRA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BRIDGE BAY, Calif. _ An osprey zoomed overhead, locked its
wings, then angled and dive-bombed the lake, like an F-14 on
maneuvers. The bird came hurtling down and hit the water with a
tremendous splash _ and a second later, it lifted off, a rainbow
trout in its talons.
</P>
<P>
   I only hoped our fishing luck could be scarcely as good.
</P>
<P>
   It was a warm evening at Shasta Lake, the water emerald green
and still, broken only by occasional pools from schooling shad
minnows. This is the magic that fishermen and ospreys alike yearn
for all year: Those schooling minnows can activate trout and other
fish into feeding frenzies.
</P>
<P>
   Already, it had started, as the osprey had demonstrated. The
result has been some of the best catches of the year at any lake in
California, not only for osprey, but for fishermen as well.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Miralles, tackle inventor and guide, had four straight
trips last week where he took 11 people, who caught (and mostly
released) a total of 173 trout, with consecutive days of 32, 38, 45
and 58. That averages out to nearly 16 per person, with the trout
averaging 16 inches, the biggest going 20 inches (caught by my
partner, Stephani Cruickshank), along with a monster fish that was
battled for 20 minutes, but turned out to be an 11-pound squawfish.
And then there was the huge one I had.
</P>
<P>
   You see, when the shad minnows start schooling, everything
starts to bite. At Shasta, that adds up to mind-boggling numbers of
fish, with 22 species here, highlighted by rainbow trout and
spotted bass, but sprinkled with some huge brown trout, including
one we've named Mo. There are even salmon, catfish and sturgeon,
though Mr. Sturgy is often only hooked by accident.
</P>
<P>
   Not so with the trout. They love nothing more than shad. That is
why Miralles has invented the Humdinger lure, which is designed to
simulate shad. That is also why the blue-silver and black-silver
patterns work so well in September and October, when shad are
schooling and the trout will approach from below, then attack with
short bursts at high speed.
</P>
<P>
   At Bridge Bay, we launched the boat with Miralles, and then
cruised toward the dam, stopping to troll on the outside the mouths
of small bays.
</P>
<P>
   The shad have been schooling 20 to 35 feet deep, occasionally
making for the surface, so we set up our Scotty downriggers to put
the lures at 40, 60 and 80 feet deep, so they would ``swim'' just
under the schools of baitfish. Note that as cooler nights and even
the first light rains of fall arrive, there is always a period
where all the shad _ and the trout chasing them _ will come right
to the surface, providing the wildest fishing of the year.
</P>
<P>
   That is still to come.
</P>
<P>
   We had fished only 15 minutes when Stephani had that 20-inch
rainbow trout that did everything but get off; zig, zag, dive, jump
and finally, it rushed right into the net. In the next 20 minutes,
Jeremy, 10, got a beauty, and then it was Kris, 7, with another.
The fish just kept biting. They can't help it. The shad are too
much to resist.
</P>
<P>
   It was just before sunset when I finally hooked a big one. It
wasn't Mo, but maybe it was Son of Mo. The big ones often swirl
right on top after being hooked, maybe even give you a tail splash,
then burrow deep on a power dive, and there's nothing you can do
but hold on and pray that the hook holds. And so it was, complete
with prayers, with my rod pulled down like a croquet hoop.
</P>
<P>
   After 10 minutes, the fish came back up to the surface, maybe 45
feet off to the side of the boat, where you could see a small
V-wake from his head and tail, and estimate its length; yeah, at
least a 20, 21-incher, likely bigger, maybe 24.
</P>
<P>
   It was so big that everybody aboard got quiet. The fish was
swimming lateral to the boat now, about 30 feet off, maybe had a
power dive or two left, but then, I figured, it would be in the
net, mine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look,'' Miralles said, pointing skyward. ``Here comes an
osprey.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure enough, another sharp-eyed predator was coming in like an
F-14, then angled to get a better look at my fish. Hey, I thought,
you've got to be kidding, this fish is way too big for any bird.
</P>
<P>
   But out of the corner of the fish's eye, the trout must have got
a glimpse of that osprey. Because right when that bird was
overhead, the big trout vaulted backwards over his tail, a complete
back flip _ never seen anything like it _ and then burrowed
straight down deep into water. Somewhere amid this circus act, the
hook came out. And yep, that big fish kept right on going.
</P>
<P>
   The osprey just flew on, still looking for dinner, and I stood
there on the boat, my rod now featherlight with the fish gone, with
this empty feeling that only comes when the big one gets away.
</P>

 UNDATED: to change.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He paused. The engine and radio were off. The only sounds were
the gurgle of the chum bucket and the lapping of low waves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Partly,'' he added about his book, ``I wanted people to feel a
sense of outrage, to know that the people being paid to guard the
hen house are foxes.''
</P>
<P>
   Referring to fishery regulators, who set quotas and are often
seen as cozy with big business, he said: ``They mostly got better
than they deserved. There was much worse that could have been
said.''
</P>
<P>
   Carl Safina was born on May 23, 1955, to a middle-class family
in New York City. When he was 10, his family moved to suburban Long
Island, and his father took him often to its pebbly north shore for
striped bass.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that my father and I, with our secret fishing spot,
were very, very lucky,'' he recalled in his book. ``The arrival of
the bulldozers on our shoreline was an unfathomable catastrophe. In
a youngster's world view, the country map is small. Loss of my
beach amounted to expatriation. And no one is so long-remembering
as a refugee.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, he watched as ripples of development spread.
Eventually they moved through the distant fishing grounds he had
come to love off Long Island. In growing alarm, he studied ecology
throughout the 1980s, earning a doctorate from Rutgers in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   A turning point came in 1989 while he was fishing about 50 miles
south of Fire Island, off Long Island. The bluefin tuna were thick,
and armadas of fishermen were doing everything in their power to
catch the shimmering gold.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were getting ridiculous amounts,'' he recalled.
``Somebody got on the radio and said, `Guys, maybe we should leave
some for tomorrow.' Another guy came on and said, `Hey, they didn't
leave any buffalo for me.'''
</P>
<P>
   That image came to haunt Safina.
</P>
<P>
   In his work and writings, he began to refer to global
overfishing as ``the last buffalo hunt,'' a phrase that eventually
joined the lexicon of marine conservation.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1990s he dedicated himself to reversing the trend, mainly
by using his scientific and persuasive skills in the field of
fishery regulation and management. While often succeeding, Safina
had his share of frustrations and setbacks.
</P>
<P>
   In summer 1993, he set aside his routine by leaving Islip, where
he lived and worked, and renting a room at the Montauk marina where
he kept his boat. There he meditated. Day and night he pored over
notes and ideas, occasionally taking a breather by going out to
sea. Eventually he hit on a book plan that excited him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to preach outside the choir,'' he recalled.
</P>
<P>
   A labor of love, the book recounts his travels to 18 shorelines
around the globe and profiles ongoing battles between fish and
people. The sites, which double as chapter titles, include Ogunquit
in Maine, Yachats in Oregon, Malakal in Palau and Sulu in the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
   In Sulu, he stumbled into armed battles between local warlords
fighting for political dominance, and at times feared for his life
as he investigated how communities of poor fisherman are trying to
kick the deadly habit of poisoning coral reefs. When squirted into
reefs, sodium cyanide _ the same stuff used to kill prisoners _
stuns fish and allows easy catches, mainly for the aquarium trade.
But corals subsequently die.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacific is widely scarred by such poisoning. But in Sulu, a
tropical archipelago that forms the southern flank of the
Philippines, some local fishermen are trying to unlearn
self-defeating chemical tricks and instead make a living with nets
and traps. Safina dived with the men on a reef scarred by cyanide
poisoning and dynamite blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``One trainee works for 10 minutes to entrap a single emperor
angelfish,'' he wrote. ``He finally succeeds, carefully removing
the struggling blue booty from the net and slipping it into his
mesh-topped bucket. This little emperor is worth about $12 to him.
Someone in the U.S. will pay about $150 to acquire it.''
</P>
<P>
   The book is often melancholy.
</P>
<P>
   Safina said its title, ``Song for the Blue Ocean,'' reflects not
only the sea's color but also its not-so-obvious state of decline.
Despite the blues, he added, his own song for the ocean contains
hints of optimism. One of his refrains is that the sea has huge
regenerative powers.
</P>
<P>
   He checked off recent successes in fisheries restraint,
crediting the increasingly large and feisty alliance of
environmental groups and sports fishermen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've accomplished some real long shots that we had every
reason to be pessimistic about,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, after an extended lull, a large school of skipjacks
broke the surface, offering a tantalizing opportunity for Safina,
the sport fisherman, raw and undisguised. He had no tags for small
game.
</P>
<P>
   He grabbed his tuna rod and cast hard, the bright lure falling
into the agitated water that marked the school's leading edge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fish on,'' he said with a grin as the rod bent over.
</P>
<P>
   He reeled in a glistening, 20-inch skipjack, its sides a rainbow
of colors, its back electric blue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very pretty,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While still in the water beside the boat, the handsome fish
slipped off the hook and sped away.
</P>
<P>
   Safina looked on contentedly. Earlier, he had used a file to
remove the hook's barb as part of his inconspicuous war on the
mentality of excess.

   NEW YORK _ Did you grow up hearing you should never wear white
after Labor Day? Well, forget it. Chanel and Prada featured white
shoes, boots and bags for fall, reminding the fashion world of the
white go-go boots Courreges showed with his space age clothes in
the 1960s. And with the millennium approaching, white looks
ultramodern again.
</P>
<P>
   Chanel's white ankle boots ($765), Prada's white wedgies ($360)
and Miu Miu's white Mary Janes ($250) can all be found at Neiman
Marcus, along with Manolo Blahnik's high-heeled mules with
Swiss-cheese holes ($455).
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York has sporty white leather gloves in its private
label collection ($110 to $185), Prada's knee-high boots ($670),
Michel Perry's ankle boots ($455), Jil Sander's loafers ($425), two
Prada handbags with short shoulder straps ($680 and $740), Drea
Kadilak's felt cloche hat ($195), and white-framed sunglasses by
Calvin Klein ($195), Isaac Mizrahi ($165) and Jean LaFont ($210).

`ENCORE! ENCORE!' AND `THE HUGHLEYS': REGAL AIRS ON NBC, UPWARD
MOBILITY ON ABC 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Most sitcoms about families pretend to be connected to real
life, though the link is tenuous. Two brash new comedies competing
head to head Tuesday night position themselves on either side of
that big, banal middle ground where most series live.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' with Nathan Lane as an opera star who
returns home to his California family, is played as farce, a
larger-than-life romp. ``The Hughleys,'' about a successful black
businessman who moves his family to a white-bread suburb, focuses
its wit on the realistic issue of upward mobility, a subject rarely
seen on screen. They are among a handful of shows that deserve to
break out of this season's mediocre pack, and choosing between the
two of them comes down to personal taste, not quality.
</P>
<P>
   The first episode of ``Encore! Encore!'' was recast and reshot,
leading to word that the series was on its deathbed. That is just
where the hero seems to be in the opening scene. Lane, as an opera
star named Joe Pinoni, lies in an Italian hospital wearing his
clown costume from ``Pagliacci.'' His vocal cords have been damaged
by emergency treatment he received after eating a bad clam. ``He
was going to be the Fourth Tenor; now he may never sing again,''
says the doctor (in Italian with English subtitles). He instantly
establishes the series' knowing, self-dramatizing tone, which is
like no other on television and which suits the Pinoni family
perfectly.
</P>
<P>
   When Joe returns to the winery his family owns, he arrives
dropping names like Placido and Luciano, and expecting his sister
to pay the limo driver. Yet he seems endearingly needy. ``Encore!
Encore!'' takes full advantage of Lane's talent for creating
flamboyant, theatrical characters (in films like ``The Birdcage''
and onstage in ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'').
He and his co-stars, Joan Plowright and Glenne Headly, form the
most accomplished, high-powered cast on television.
</P>
<P>
   We soon see where Joe's over-the-top personality came from. As
his mother, Ms. Plowright sweeps in and out of rooms with
deliciously regal flair, though her logic is sometimes addled. She
has a common-sensical side that she has passed on to her daughter,
Francesca (Ms. Headly), who runs the winery. The high-culture
allusions and the whiff of an ``Upstairs, Downstairs'' split
between Joe and his modest sister are reminders that this series
was created by the producers of ``Frasier,'' another series that
happily flaunts its lovable snobs.
</P>
<P>
   Some running jokes are overplayed, like Mrs. Pinoni's hobby of
attending strangers' funerals. Then there is the ongoing joke about
Joe's womanizing. When he asks his mother if her neighbors have any
voluptuous daughters, she responds with a pointed line (too good to
step on here), which hints that this theme may not be played
entirely straight.
</P>
<P>
   Though the first show is surprisingly funny, ``Encore! Encore!''
is clearly in flux. Next week's episode is already too predictable,
as Joe and Francesca get reacquainted, leading to many eruptions of
sibling rivalry. But the cast members are such fun to watch, they
can carry the series while it finds its footing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' arrives firmly tethered to reality, its humor
in place, with barbed remarks that make gentle fun of both black
culture and the foreign territory in which the family has landed.
Stand-up comedian D.L. Hughley plays the fictional Darryl Hughley,
who owns a vending machine company and has moved with his wife and
two children a few miles and a lifetime of experience away from the
all-black Los Angeles neighborhood in which he grew up.
</P>
<P>
   On his first morning in the new house, Darryl goes outside to
get the mail and is accosted by the little old lady next door, who
asks him to take out her trash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lady, who do I look like, Benson?'' Darryl asks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you very much, Benson,'' she says, and disappears.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the show, Darryl's petulance and tendency to see
everything in racial terms is tempered by his wife, Yvonne (Elise
Neal), who makes a smoother transition to their new neighborhood.
``She tells everyone to fetch her trash; she's 88,'' Yvonne says of
the neighbor.
</P>
<P>
   But Darryl fears that his childhood friend Milsap (John Henton)
is right when he warns, ``You on the slippery slope to losing your
blackness.'' Milsap sees Darryl paying his bills on time and
wonders, ``Who are you?''; Yvonne quickly reassures Darryl that
they have always paid their bills on time. ``The Hughleys'' is at
its best when it toys with stereotypes this way, acknowledging and
shattering them with shrewd humor.
</P>
<P>
   Hughley brings just enough of an edge to Darryl, who sometimes
acts like a baby yet is ultimately a reasonable guy. The danger is
that ``The Hughleys'' might lose that edge and give in to typical
sitcom solutions. At the end of Tuesday night's episode, Darryl
overcomes his suspicion that his neighbor Dave is a bigot. Dave
says he thinks of Darryl as ``the n-word: neighbor,'' which seems
too pat. Like its hero, ``The Hughleys'' may be at risk of
surrendering its soul to the comfy land of ``Home Improvement''
(the show it follows on ABC).
</P>
<P>
   Yet there are more hopeful signs than danger signals in this
engaging series. Chris Rock, one of its executive producers, has
stated his affection for ``The Jeffersons,'' the original sitcom
about an upwardly mobile black family that kept its roots alive.
When Milsap enters the Hughley home and sings, ``Movin' on up,''
from the Jeffersons' theme, he might as well be declaring that
``The Hughleys'' plans a long, successful stay.

   NEW YORK _ Christian Slater is coming to Broadway, to assume the
demanding role of Clifford in Warren Leight's acclaimed memory
play, ``Side Man,'' for at least three months when it reopens on
Oct. 20 at the Golden Theater. Slater has appeared in films like
``Broken Arrow'' and ``Hard Rain'' and on and off-Broadway in works
like the 1978 production of ``Music Man.''
</P>
<P>
   He will replace Robert Sella, who created the role of Clifford,
whose reunion with his jazzman father triggers memories of a
chaotic childhood. Sella has moved to ``Cabaret'' to play the MC.
</P>
<P>
   Stolen Goods
</P>
<P>
   Two hooded gunmen made off on Monday with two impressionist
paintings after invading the home of Jean Fournis, the curator of
the Fine Arts Museum of Nice, France, and forcing him to take them
into the museum, where they overpowered guards. The paintings,
``The Cliffs of Dieppe,'' by Claude Monet, and ``The Alley of the
Poplars,'' by Alfred Sisley, were on loan from the government. The
culture minister, Catherine Trautmann, said both paintings were so
widely known that they would be impossible to sell.
</P>
<P>
   Aftermath
</P>
<P>
   Five years after his death, Rudolf Nureyev has been restored to
the political good graces of Russia. Deputy Prosecutor General
Alexander Zviyaguintsev announced Monday that the ballet dancer,
who was sentenced to seven years in prison in his native Soviet
Union when he defected to France in 1961, had been posthumously
rehabilitated.
</P>
<P>
   Under a law regarding victims of political reprisals, Nureyev
was deemed not guilty of the crimes for which he was convicted. He
was a star of the Kirov Ballet in St. Petersburg, then known as
Leningrad, when he sought asylum on his first trip abroad. He did
not return home for 25 years. He died in Paris at age 54.
</P>
<P>
   Again, No
</P>
<P>
   Autumn in Paris is going to be like summer in New York: no
``Peony Pavilion.'' The Paris Autumn Festival announced Monday that
the Chinese authorities had forbidden the Shanghai Kunqu Opera
Company's production of the 19-hour, 55-scene 16th-century work to
leave for performances in France in November and December.
</P>
<P>
   The festival announced, ``Despite the many endeavors made by the
Paris Autumn Festival and French authorities at the very highest
level, the Shanghai Municipal Culture Bureau, which triggered the
last-minute cancellation of the first performances scheduled in
July of this year at the Lincoln Center Festival in New York, has
maintained its opposition to the production and made it impossible
for the 53 members of the Shanghai Kunqu Company to come to
France.'' Cultural officials in Shanghai deemed the production
``ideologically unsuitable and pornographic.''

GERMAN TV DELETES GRAPHIC DETAILS FROM CLINTON TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By EDMUND L. ANDREWS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Two of Germany's national television
networks said Monday that they would not broadcast the most sordid
sections of President Clinton's videotaped testimony, while
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said the release of the tapes ``makes me
vomit.''
</P>
<P>
   NTV, a commercial television news network, announced that it
would replay most of the testimony but would delete the most
``intimate'' and most sexually explicit details.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix, a public channel that carries speeches and other public
proceedings, interrupted its transmission of the testimony for live
coverage of Clinton's speech at the United Nations. Network
officials said that they would carry only testimony that did not
``violate ethical and journalistic standards.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Germans who wanted to watch the full testimony had
to listen in English to broadcasts on either CNN and BBC World.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will carry four hours of testimony tonight,'' Bernd
Schwintowski, a spokesman for the NTV network in Berlin, said
Monday, ``but when the testimony goes into the private sphere or
the most intimate details of private life, we will not transmit
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwintowski said the network's decision had not been the result
of pressure from Kohl or other German politicians, virtually all of
whom said they were revolted by the release of the tapes.
</P>
<P>
   But the pressure was nevertheless intense, and several political
leaders openly assailed broadcasters who planned to carry the
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes me vomit,'' said Kohl in Bonn on Monday morning. In
an interview on Sunday with the newspaper Die Welt, Kohl expressed
deep sadness and sympathy for Clinton. ``I think the whole thing is
a catastrophe,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gunda Roestel, a top official in the Green Party who is on the
advisory board of the publicly owned ZDF television network, openly
tried to prevent the Phoenix channel from carrying the testimony.
Phoenix is jointly owned by ZDF and ARD, Germany's other main
public television network.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Roestel, asserting that the Phoenix channel would become ``a
voyeur to a political smear campaign,'' appealed to ZDF executives
to block the Phoenix transmission. It was unclear if the pressure
caused Phoenix to change its plans, but the network did break away
from the live transmission shortly after it began.
</P>
<P>
   Oskar Lafontaine, chairman of the opposition Social Democratic
Party, found himself in rare harmony with Kohl. Lafontaine said
that release of the tapes was ``disgusting and revolting.'' He said
that he hoped the American spectacle would ignite a new discussion
about the need for public officials to retain a sphere of privacy.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Cooler and less humid air will enter the Northeast and Middle
Atlantic States Tuesday as a strong cold front pushes toward the
Atlantic Seaboard. Showers will precede the front in eastern New
England in the morning while interior sections will experience
gusty breezes from the north. A secondary disturbance in the wake
of the front will cause a few sprinkles over the mountains of
northern New England.
</P>
<P>
   Chilly air will also cover the upper Midwest and Northern Plains
as the ridge of high pressure representing the center of the
Canadian air mass builds toward Lake Michigan. The flow of
unseasonably cool air over the relatively warm waters of the Great
Lakes will instigate a few showers over northern Michigan while
much of Minnesota and North Dakota are graced by ample sunshine.
</P>
<P>
   The boundary between the cool air mass to the north and tropical
air to the south will be the focus for showers and thunderstorms
from Virginia to Oklahoma. Over the interior Deep South, hazy
sunshine and high humidity will be punctuated by only isolated
thundershowers. Downpours associated with a weak trough will douse
much of Florida and the central Gulf Coast.
</P>
<P>
   Winds ascending the sloping terrain in the foothills of the
central Rockies will result in some showers over Wyoming and
Colorado. Elsewhere, much of the West will be seasonable with ample
sunshine. The exception will be the immediate California coast
where low clouds will prevail.
</P>
<P>
   Hurricane Georges, with winds up to 110 miles an hour will skirt
the northern coast of Hispaniola.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: The Wall
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Hurricane Georges weakened as it approached the
invisible wall near longitude 60 degrees that frequently guards the
Caribbean Sea. It is here that westward moving tropical storms and
hurricanes can lose substantial strength as clashing high-altitude
winds interfere with the storm's delicate structure. The wall is a
zone of wind shear created by winds blowing from the east around
the high pressure system in the Atlantic and westerly winds
produced by a high pressure system that develops over hot northern
South America. Upon hitting the wall, a hurricane can literally be
pulled apart. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scene at the Supper Club on West 47th Street
seemed to evoke the glory days of jazz _ an ebullient swing band
playing classic Ellington tunes as dancers in period costumes
rocketed around the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than a throwback to the past, the filming for a PBS
special was a snapshot of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra as one
of the great cultural success stories in New York. In just a decade
Jazz at Lincoln Center has become the flagship jazz organization in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Wynton Marsalis, the most celebrated jazz musician of his
time, it is scheduled to move to the kind of coveted location that
comes along only once every few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has highlighted the growth of Jazz at Lincoln Center, a
constituent of the center for only two years, as much as the
announcement in July that the redevelopment plans for Columbus
Circle will include an 1,100-seat concert hall and complex of
offices and rehearsal rooms for the program. The concert hall is
billed as the first to be acoustically designed for jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth of Jazz at Lincoln Center, whose new season is in
full swing, is also a reminder of the program's ambitious agenda
and its contentious place in the jazz world.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz at Lincoln Center is not just about making music. It is
also, very consciously, about making choices, about defining the
canon of an art form that is less than a century old. That goal has
almost inevitably brought controversy and with it a question at the
heart of the program's mission: Does it exist mostly to celebrate
jazz's past or should it be helping to shape its future as well?
</P>
<P>
   By almost any conventional measure, Jazz at Lincoln Center has
been an astounding success. The program's budget has grown in three
years from $3 million to $9 million, and this year it will present
nearly 400 concerts, lectures, classes and workshops in New York
and around the world. Most concerts play to sold-out houses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Marsalis became the first jazz artist to win a
Pulitzer Prize for music. On Friday he played and spoke in a
program at the White House. Officials are confident they will be
able to raise the $65 million it will take to build their new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a marvelous job, and incorporating jazz on an
equal basis at Lincoln Center is very important,'' said Dan
Morgenstern, director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers
University. ``Jazz has never had a space like the one at Columbus
Circle. It's quite wonderful what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the jazz world, which often is as factionalized as a lost
Trotskyist tribe, the reviews are more mixed.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of many criticisms is the sense that Jazz at
Lincoln Center is using its bully pulpit to foster a cautious,
unadventurous view of what jazz is. Given Marsalis' celebrity and
commercial success, its programming is having an effect beyond
Lincoln Center to help determine what kind of jazz and jazz
musicians are recorded and promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics and musicians say that the program's commissions
have too often gone to Marsalis, that he has used his influence to
polarize the jazz world and that the program has slighted white
artists at the expense of a pointedly Afrocentric view of jazz's
history and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Most pervasive is the criticism that Lincoln Center is purveying
a cautious, static and dated approach to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a lot to take the essence of jazz and distort it;
they've put a damper on the main ingredient of jazz, which is
innovation,'' said George Russell, a much-admired jazz composer and
pianist who has been an important figure in jazz since working with
Dizzy Gillespie in the 1940s. ``I think whatever happens at Lincoln
Center, history will have to correct it, because it does need
correcting terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just a window onto Jazz at Lincoln Center, the
disputes are highlighting two vexing issues in jazz overall.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the generational flip-flop in which most of the
innovators are in their 40s, 50s and 60s, while the most
conspicuous younger musicians, modeled after Marsalis, are viewed
as polished, cautious traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the ill-defined cultural status of jazz, with some
skeptics questioning whether it belongs at Lincoln Center and
others questioning whether it will inevitably be watered down
because it is there.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis said the criticisms, which have played out in the jazz
press almost since the program began, are old issues recycled too
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellington faced this; Coltrane had to defend himself in
writing,'' he said. ``There's always some side story that becomes
the issue instead of the music. And my whole thing is: What about
the music?''
</P>
<P>
   The writer Stanley Crouch says the criticisms reflect envy more
than substance. Crouch has helped define the program's approach,
along with Marsalis, the author Albert Murray, and Rob Gibson, who
is executive producer and director of Jazz at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a classic Rolls driving by on a hot day and a
guy standing in the sun waiting for a bus, that guy is going to
have one of two reactions,'' Crouch said. ``Either the Rolls is no
good or he should be driving it. Most of the criticisms come down
to either `I'm not being hired there,' or `My ideas are not being
adopted.'''

<P>
   After Just 11 Years, an Equal Partner
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a three-concert jazz program in 1987, Jazz at
Lincoln Center became a department, dependent on Lincoln Center for
money in 1991, and in 1996 became the 12th independent constituent
on an equal footing _ if not with equal resources _ with powers
like the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had astounding growth, and it's the result of the
incredible power of this music,'' said Gordon Davis, the program's
chairman, a former city parks commissioner and now a powerful
real-estate attorney. ``We're all riding a mission here because
we're involved in something we believe is profoundly important,
which is this music, in this country at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission translates to acclaimed education programs,
particularly those taught by Marsalis. And the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra has the most extensive touring schedule at Lincoln
Center, with 90 cities on five continents this year.
</P>
<P>
   The program's mission also consciously extends to trying to
define what jazz is. Marsalis and Gibson argue that just as
European music has an established canon of essential music, jazz
too needs to establish its own canon, with Louis Armstrong, Duke
Ellington, Charlie Parker and others as its version of Bach, Mozart
and Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   Many jazz fans, particularly those in the large group more
likely to hear jazz at a concert hall than a downtown club, find it
hard to fathom what could be wrong with a vibrant jazz presence at
the leading American performing arts complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone doing as much as they're doing to promote the
appreciation and respect and love of the music is doing the right
thing,'' said Richard Cohen, a creative director at a Manhattan
advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   But in the jazz world the picture is far more mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do there sounds so old,'' said Sonny Fortune, a
saxophonist who has played with Miles Davis and many others. ``I
want to get excited by music, but a lot of what they do there, you
can go to sleep on it. I don't know if I'd say absolutely that what
they do is bad for jazz, but surely, absolutely I wouldn't see it
as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many musicians scoff at the notion that it is the
role of Lincoln Center to establish a canon for jazz, saying such a
canon evolves naturally and that Lincoln Center's version is pallid
and limited.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Lincoln Center's institutional heft and commercial
muscle has distorted the economics of the jazz business.
</P>
<P>
   Other Musicians Find Less Work
</P>
<P>
   Marty Khan, whose company, Outward Visions, has represented jazz
artists and promoted jazz concerts and events for more then two
decades, said that when he started, colleges and arts groups used
to program four to 12 jazz events a year, paying $4,500 to $7,500.
Now many just do a few dates, usually including one by Marsalis or
the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra at several times that cost.
</P>
<P>
   This results in less work for other artists and audiences weaned
on classical, mainstream jazz rather than more adventurous fare.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Osby, a saxophonist who has moved between mainstream jazz
and more progressive jazz, said the passions about Lincoln Center's
direction have cooled since they were the talk of jazz a few years
back, partly because not many musicians outside what he described
as ``a select few people who pander to a certain taste and
ideology'' now expect to play there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of resentment, but everyone has come to the
conclusion that no matter who gripes, it's not going to change
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that most artists realized that Lincoln Center did not
represent all of jazz, just one facet of it, and that venues more
partial to experimentation could flourish at the same time. Still,
he said, given its visibility and resources, many musicians wish
Jazz at Lincoln Center had a broader vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz is a living art form that feeds on contemporary trends,
steps across fences, borrows from alien sources and brings them
back in a new way,'' he said. ``You have people doing incredible
things today, but they never get a chance to play at Lincoln Center
because they seem to think jazz stopped in 1967.''

 &HT;    Internet access to Clinton testimony a crash course in
programsBy Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Internet users who tried to access President Clinton's grand
jury testimony Monday might have felt as though they'd been through
a grueling four-hour ordeal themselves _ even if they were only
online for a few minutes.
</P>
<P>
   That's because unlike the Starr Report which was simply text,
the President's videotaped testimony required a great deal of
bandwidth _ a measure of how fast data can be delivered on the Web.
By comparison, the entire 445-page Starr report fit on a single
floppy disk, while about one minute of video would fill a single
floppy disk.
</P>
<P>
   So, users logging on to the Net yesterday encountered words like
plug-in, NetShow, RealVideo buffer, streaming and ``connection
lost'' as they got a crash course in the advantages and drawbacks
of online video and how far the Web still has to go before
streaming video becomes as common as e-mail or on-demand stock
quotes.
</P>
<P>
   At 9 a.m., it was fairly easy to log onto the Web sites of the
major news organizations streaming (the Web version of
broadcasting) the video. All Web sites had printed notices
indicating the testimony contained graphic sexual content that
might not be appropriate for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   When users choose to see the video, if they've downloaded the
proper plug in a pop-up screen supplied by RealVideo or Microsoft's
NetShow will download and then display the video and accompanying
audio.
</P>
<P>
   AccessAtlanta (http://www.accessatlanta.com) offered the
complete text of the speech as well as highlights of the testimony.
MSNBC.com embedded the video-plug in within its homepage, making it
hard for users to tell if the video was loading or not.
</P>
<P>
   But there were a range of problems accompanying the live,
streaming video, ranging from choppy pictures to video streams
abruptly closing down with an error message appearing on the screen
saying the ``connection to the server'' had been lost. To return to
the video, users had to reload the program, which required a small
amount of wait time.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have to understand in the offline, analog world, we
interact seamlessly between video, graphics and text,'' says
Jupiter Communications analyst Ross Rubin. ``but when you make
those things digital you have very different requirements.''
</P>
<P>
   Rubin says the video testimony served as a sharp contrast to
last week's release of the Starr Report over the Web. ``It goes a
long way toward showing the strengths and weaknesses of the Web as
a distribution medium,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a text-based info such as the Starr Report the web can
meet that need. However, when you talk about rich media text-based
medium, such as video, the Web as it exists today is ill-equipped
to handle it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What works best on the video side is talking heads,'' says CNN
Interactive spokesman Kerrin Roberts. CNN.com is using InterVU,
Broadcast.com and Real Broadcast Network to help serve the live and
on-demand versions of the video. ``InterVU has confirmed that
between 9 a.m. and 11:30 a.m. that the video has been accessed more
than 200,000 times.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts also said that at 11 a.m. Monday nearly 9,500 users were
simultaneously accessing the testimony. CNN also provided an
audio-only version which had about 2,600 users at any given time.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin, who heads Jupiter's Web technologies group says the
combination of user demand and the Web being unequipped to serve
real time video on demand was the cause of most users' problems.
``Even in the best of traffic conditions on a dial-up connection,
the experience is going to be far inferior to television,'' he
says, adding that the audio portions of the testimony were
excellent quality because both RealAudio and Microsoft have been
making steady advances in Web audio technology.
</P>
<P>
   He says a small black and white Sony Watchman is probably a
better viewing experience, since the frame speed stays fairly even.
``There's only so much you can do with limited bandwidth,'' says
Rubin of the video troubles. ''Most of the Web video usage we are
seeing today is from people who don't have any other way of
accessing the information.''
</P>
<P>
   By mid-day MSNBC, CNN and others had compiled a ``highlights''
page of video and text, which featured audio in smaller snippets
and complete text in a variety of formats. While not as
cutting-edge as the real-time streaming testimony which was
simultaneously available, these presentations were easier to access
and view. MSNBC.com reported heavy but not record breaking
activity.
</P>
<P>
   For those with neither the time, the inclination nor the
appropriate equipment to view the testimony, CNN's sister Web site
All Politics (http://www.allpolitics.com) was offering an ongoing,
minute by minute summary of the main points of Clinton's testimony.
All that was needed to access that site was a Web browser. National
Public Radio also made an audio version available later in the day
on its Web site.
</P>
<P>
   America Online offered live video streaming and a chat room for
users to discuss the testimony. By mid-afternoon Monday, more than
10,000 AOL users had posted comments about the live testimony,
which concluded around 2 p.m.

 NEW YORK: in 1967.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a Black Forte, Race Is an Issue
</P>
<P>
   And in a field where racial issues, including questions about
whether whites can play jazz, have been tossed around for decades,
it's not surprising that some white musicians and critics say
Lincoln Center in its programming, tributes and commissions has
regularly slighted the contributions of white musicians. Of 16
musicians commissioned to create original music cited by Gibson,
four were white, one was Latino and the rest were black.
</P>
<P>
   The commissions range from $2,500 to $15,000. Marsalis, whose
composing gets more mixed notices than his playing, has been
commissioned to do a work every year but one since they began as
part of his contract. Gibson declined to say how much Marsalis is
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis and Gibson dismiss any notion of a racial slant, and
others say that almost any fair reading of the giants of jazz would
have a preponderance of blacks. And Gibson said many criticisms
reflected the misimpression that Marsalis' work is synonymous with
Jazz at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lots of the people who criticize us have never looked
at what we do,'' Gibson said. ``You can't look at the musicians
we've featured and say this is a predictable, narrow approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson cited musicians as diverse as Benny Carter, Ray Santos,
the Japanese conductor and arranger Katsuhiko Tanaka and Joe Lovano
as evidence of the range of works presented at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a broad range of concerts, programming this year
includes a yearlong celebration of the centennial of Duke
Ellington's birth and collaborations with the New York Philharmonic
and New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis said he makes no apologies for making esthetic
judgments of what musicians to feature, decisions that have largely
tuned out both avant-gardists on one side and purveyors of pop jazz
or electric funk on the other.
</P>
<P>
   He said the focus on a jazz canon is not a static approach to
jazz but a way of establishing a bedrock of excellence that all
great players need to master before they can develop fully on their
own.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're a writer, it's assumed that you should know
Shakespeare or Melville or Dickens,'' Marsalis said. ``But in our
field, for some reason, you had people saying to be great in jazz
you're not supposed to know anything. That's the view that was
prevalent when I was coming up, and that's what's helped to deplete
our field of musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians say the real problem is not what Lincoln Center
does or doesn't do, but that so few others are trying to do the
same thing. There are plenty of jazz orchestras, including Jon
Faddis' Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, but no major arts institution has
made the commitment that Lincoln Center has to a continuing
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wynton has to be himself; if Ornette Coleman was heading Jazz
at Lincoln Center, it would be very different,'' said Joe Lovano, a
white saxophonist, who received a Lincoln Center commission for a
work. ``What Wynton is doing is great. The trouble is you can't
expect them to do everything. What you'd like to see is for this to
springboard across the country, so that every city that has a major
symphony orchestra has a jazz orchestra as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the critics say Lincoln Center's role in many ways
mirrors the commercial currents of jazz in general and the
constraints of trying to run a nonprofit organization at high-cost
venues like Alice Tully Hall. Thus Lester Bowie, a trumpeter and
vocal critic of Marsalis, said he did not expect to play at Lincoln
Center because his work is more popular in Europe than in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said much of the backbiting had reflected the inevitable
growing pains of a program starting with the most essential music
and slowly making its way through the rich panoply of the jazz
world.
</P>
<P>
   New Solutions in a New Home
</P>
<P>
   He said the new hall would allow Jazz at Lincoln Center to
present five to 10 times as much jazz in New York as the
organization has been able to do in the past, some of it in smaller
or less expensive spaces that will be more conducive to
commercially marginal fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more musicians and a lot more of the jazz
community we want to put on our stage,'' he said. ``I mean we're
just getting to Hank Jones. This is one of the most important jazz
musicians of our time. He's 80 years old, and we've never had him
on our stage. We're not trying to be politically correct. It just
takes time to get to everyone we'd like to have. People forget that
we're a very young organization in a very young art form. We're at
the mezzanine level of a 20-story building.''

   CLINTON _ WASHINGTON _ As President Clinton basked in thunderous
applause at the United Nations on Monday, wary Americans watched
unedited videotape of a pained, embarrassed and combative Clinton
testifying before independent counsel Kenneth Starr's grand jury
about his sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. The unprecedented programming produced a mix of
amusement, ridicule and condemnation and hardened the lines drawn
on Capitol Hill over whether the president should be impeached.

   CLINTON-TAPE _ WASHINGTON _ Americans saw President Clinton
portray himself Monday as a victim of his political foes as he fell
back on tortured legalisms to dodge perjury charges in his
videotaped grand jury testimony. But Clinton's historic, unscripted
four-hour ordeal before a tag team of federal prosecutors left
viewers with no ``smoking gun'' that would clearly lead Congress to
remove him from office. (Glass, Cox News Service).

   CLINTON-MONICA _ WASHINGTON _ When a friend e-mailed that she'd
lost weight, Monica Lewinsky was properly enthusiastic. ``Okay. I
hate you ...You little-size-6-bitch,'' Lewinsky replied. ``I don't
know if I can be friends with you anymore!!!!! That's nice. I'm a
10-12 so that makes me double your size.'' The portrait of Monica
Lewinsky that evolves in more than 3,000 pages of grand jury
testimony, e-mails, handwritten notes and other documentation
complied by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr is that of a young
woman who is sometimes funny, sad, naive, saavy, manipulative,

   CLINTON-CAPITAL _ WASHINGTON _ The President's testimony
reverberated through congressional offices Monday morning, but the

department stores, few D.C. residents were glued to the tube
anxiously watching their commander in chief under fire. ``I'm fed
up with it,'' said William Ransford, who is a D.C. native and has
worked at the famous Mayflower Hotel for 20 years as a housekeeper.

critics say. Defense attorneys like Jeff Senter believe the people
who run crime labs are too certain of their methods and and provide

DNA matches samples at a crime scene. Most scientists, however, say
the testing is a solid, proven and accurate way of linking suspects
to a crime. (Banta, Austin American-Statesman)

CLINTON WALKS INTO STARR'S `PERJURY TRAP,' ATTORNEYS SAY 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By STEVE LASH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton may have sealed his fate last
summer when he took the ill-advised step of agreeing not only to
testify before a federal grand jury but to have that testimony
videotaped, according to leading defense attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton walked right into independent counsel Kenneth Starr's
``perjury trap,'' said William Moffitt, president-elect of the
National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. ``No matter what
he did or no matter what he said, Mr. Starr was going to accuse him
of perjury,'' the Washington attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   It is just the nature of the system.
</P>
<P>
   Grand juries belong to the prosecutor. Normally, no defense
attorneys are permitted to be present, although in Clinton's unique
case his personal attorney, David Kendall, was allowed to attend as
Starr and his staff asked intimate questions about the president's
extramarital affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   The four-hour videotape of Clinton's testimony _ aired worldwide
Monday _ shows Clinton testy at times over repeated questions about
specifics details of his relationship with Lewinsky, a former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The president also appeared to be distinctly uncomfortable as he
sought to explain how his responses in a January deposition denying
a sexual relationship with Lewinsky were legally accurate. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Moffitt said that Clinton, himself a licensed attorney and
one-time law professor, should have abided by the lesson any
first-year law student knows: The last place the target of a
criminal investigation wants to be is before a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you're in there, you're at the mercy of a prosecutor,''
Moffitt said. ``There's no one there to protect you.''
</P>
<P>
   Add to that the idea of being videotaped _ every bead of sweat
and nervous tic recorded for posterity _ and it is enough to make a
defense attorney's ``skin crawl,'' Moffitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Those warnings of legal doom usually work with the average
criminal defendant, but the president of the United States is
unlike any other client. He is concerned not only with staying out
of legal jeopardy but preserving his place in history, and that can
be a dangerous mix for the client and his attorney, said Larry
Pozner, president of the lawyers' group.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, fearing it would seem unpresidential to be seen walking
into a federal courthouse, agreed to testify via a closed-circuit
television link from the White House to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't envy his lawyers as they try to protect a citizen
under investigation while simultaneously serving the president of
the United States whose constituency is everyone in the country,''
said Pozner, a Denver defense attorney. ``I don't want that problem
on my desk.''
</P>
<P>
   Houston attorney Kent Schaffer, president of the Texas Criminal
Defense Lawyers Association, said Clinton's appearance before the
grand jury could have been avoided. The American people would have
understood had Clinton refused to testify or asserted his
constitutional right against self incrimination, Schaffer said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have an adversary like Kenneth Starr who's made a
goal out of ruining your life ... the smart thing to do is use the
constitutional protection that has been given to you,'' Schaffer
said. ``Who among us would not squirm at the type of questions that
were asked?''
</P>
<P>
   But, Schaffer noted, Clinton is unlike any client the veteran
defense attorney has ever had.
</P>
<P>
   ``The law doesn't apply,'' Schaffer said. ``Only the law of
politics (applies) in this case.''

 &HT;    LESINSKY'S LIVELY PERONALITY EMERGES IN TESTIMONY, E-MAIL
 &HT;    600&AMP;add.
 &HT;    Eds: Material throughout may offend some readers.
 &HT;    By BOB DART
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a friend lost weight, Monica Lewinsky was
properly enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay. I hate you ... You little-size-6-bitch,'' Lewinsky wrote
by e-mail. ``I don't know if I can be friends with you anymore!!!!!
That's nice. I'm a 10-12 so that makes me double your size.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky portrayed in 3,183 pages of grand jury testimony,
e-mails, love notes and other evidence complied by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr is a young woman by turns funny and sad,
naive and savvy, manipulative and manipulated, likeable and
loathsome, and profane and promiscuous _ but always profoundly
human.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly built a rapport with the grand jury hearing her
testimony about her White House affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica, none of us in this room are perfect,'' one juror
reassures her. ``We all fall and we fall several times a day. The
only difference between my age and when I was your age is now I get
up faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The star witness had asked the jurors to call her ``Monica''
rather than ``Miss Lewinsky,'' explaining, ``I'm just 25.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll always be Miss Lewinsky, whether you're 25 or 28 or
...,'' a juror pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if I get married,'' she popped back hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail correspondence with Catherine Davis, a longtime
friend who was living in Japan, Lewinsky emerges as a realist as
well as a romantic _ and clearly a member of a younger generation
than the Baby Boomer president entering his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   She jokes that Clinton can't comprehend that her telephone
caller ID displays ``POTUS'' (president of the United States) when
he calls, and seems proud of himself when he finds a White House
phone that fools the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeez, I hate being called 'dear','' she complains to ``Cat.''
``The creep calls me that sometimes. It's an old person's
saying!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   In pressuring the president for help in finding a job in New
York, she said a news position at MTV would be nice or ``anything
at George magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't as lovestruck as she appeared to be Starr's summary
to Congress. While she professed to love the president, Lewinsky
hardly pined away in her Watergate apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I tell you I had sex with Thomas last week,'' she said in
a 1997 e-mail. ``I know. I am so naughty ... I went over there with
some ice cream and pretty much seduced him in a way that made him
put the moves on me ... cool or what???''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good time at the spa (I did it with the nutrition
guy)!!!!'' she writes another time. ``I kinda don't want to get
into the juicies on e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   She anticipates going to a black tie gala where ``hopefully
we'll meet some interesting people. A cute boy would be VERY
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Weight came up nearly as often as sex in Lewinsky's world.
Indeed, she said her extra pounds are the reason she never cleaned
the infamous semen-stained dress that provided genetic proof of her
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained weight so I couldn't wear the dress and it didn't
fit. And I'm not a very organized person. I don't clean my clothes
until I'm going to wear them again,'' she told the grand jury. When
she dropped a few pounds, she remembered the dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't keep the dress as a souvenir. I was going to wear it
on Thanksgiving and my cousins, who I always try to look skinny for
because they are all skinny,'' she said. But Linda Tripp _ who
brought the affair to Starr's attention and gave him tapes of phone
calls in which Lewinsky discussed it _ discouraged her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought me one of her jackets from her thinner closet,''
Lewinsky recalled cattily.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors questioned Lewinsky diligently, but over the
weeks of her testimony they seemed to grow more personable and
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you still love the president?'' one juror asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Monday, I would have said yes,'' Lewinsky, referring to
Aug. 17, when Clinton addressed the nation after being interrogated
by Starr. `` It was very painful for me to watch his speech on
Monday night. It's hard for me to feel that he has characterized
this relationship as a service contract. ...That all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship was.
And it was a lot more than that to me ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you and the president ever engage in sexual relations
using cigars?'' one juror asked gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay. I'd like to change the subject now,'' said the juror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' said Lewinsky. ``Just once. Just once.''
</P>
<P>
   One juror chided her that Clinton ``was a married man and it
wasn't no secret of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right to have an affair with a married man,''
Lewinsky admitted. ``I never expected to fall in love with the
president. I was surprised that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Lewinsky had clearly established a rapport with the
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you won't have to come back her any more,'' the
foreperson told her. ``But we wanted to offer you a bouquet of good
wishes that include luck, success, happiness and blessings.''

CRITIC'S NOTEBOOK: IS IT ARTISTRY OR WISHFUL THINKING? 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In pretty much the same way that Shoeless Joe Jackson
and Roger Maris have fans who are passionately devoted to getting
their heroes into the Baseball Hall of Fame, Amy Beach has
advocates who are lobbying to place her in the pantheon of great
composers.
</P>
<P>
   Respected musicians have rallied to her cause: A few seasons
ago, Ransom Wilson conducted her chamber opera, ``Cabildo,'' at
Lincoln Center, and Dennis Russell Davies led the Brooklyn
Philharmonic in her titanic ``Gaelic'' Symphony. There have been
several recent recordings of her Grand Mass. And Joanne Polk, who
is currently recording all of Beach's piano music, offered
highlights at Merkin Concert Hall on Wednesday and Saturday
evenings.
</P>
<P>
   There are reasons to cheer along this Beach revival. One is a
desire to extend American musical history from the Copland
generation backward into the 19th century. Beach fits that bill.
She lived from 1867 to 1944, established herself as a pianist and
composer before she was 18, composed prolifically _ her catalog
includes more than 300 works, most published under the name Mrs.
H.H.A. Beach _ and had works performed by major orchestras in her
lifetime. She is equally useful, of course, to anyone trying to
construct a repertory of female composers.
</P>
<P>
   But those reasons, however well-intentioned, are historical and
political, not musical, and if room is to be found in the standard
repertory for Beach's music, only musical reasons will matter. Her
time may come. But the recent spate of Beach performances,
including Ms. Polk's, suggest that it hasn't come yet.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say that Beach's music is without its charms. One
thing that was immediately clear in Ms. Polk's polished, assured
performances was the fluidity and facility with which Beach wrote
for the keyboard. Works like the ``Fantasia'' Fugata (Op. 87) and
the ``Tyrolean'' Valse-Fantasie (Op. 116) demand speed, agility and
the ability to project a grand, rich-textured sound.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Fantasia'' Fugata also showed several of Beach's more
endearing qualities. One is her sense of humor. Updating
Scarlatti's claim to have based one of his sonatas on the sound his
cat made while walking across his harpsichord, Beach said that she
created her fugue theme by placing her cat on the piano. Whether
she actually did is beside the point; the scampering dissonances in
the theme evoked a picture of a cat on the keyboard.
</P>
<P>
   That was another of Beach's salient qualities: Here, and in the
Three Pieces (Op. 128) _ musical descriptions of a chipmunk, a
group of young birches and a hummingbird _ she proved to be an
estimable painter in sound.
</P>
<P>
   Several works made their appeal through simple, direct lyricism.
The Piano Quintet (Op. 67), in which Ms. Polk was supported
beautifully by the Lark Quartet, was rich and dark, with soaring
lines and inventive chord progressions. The same qualities
enlivened the Largo con Dolore movement of the Violin Sonata (Op.
34), in which Ms. Polk's able collaborator was Curtis Macomber.
</P>
<P>
   So, why not join the growing Beach appreciation society? There
were moments during Ms. Polk's concerts when the prospect was
tempting, but as those moments came and went, doubts about Beach
remained. It was impossible, for example, to sweep aside the sense
that the influences on her music too often overshadowed her own
voice.
</P>
<P>
   In work after work, one heard gestures borrowed from
Mendelssohn, Schumann, Chopin, Brahms and Strauss. There is also a
grandiose quality to Beach's music that rings false to
late-20th-century ears. Huge chordal flourishes, bombastic themes,
chordal figures running up and down the keyboard and other
varieties of sheer romantic steaminess were meant to make the music
majestic, yet beneath all the clatter, much of it was a not
particularly durable variety of salon music.
</P>
<P>
   If Beach's works cannot satisfy listeners' purely musical needs,
her historical use will be limited as well. Such are the
disappointments of musical excavation.
</P>
<P>
   In terms of the turn-of-the-century American repertory, it may
be that the era did not produce much for today's listener; Beach's
music is no less interesting than that of, say, John Knowles Paine
or Horatio Parker.
</P>
<P>
   In the field of female composers, greater discoveries are being
made across the ocean. Hildegard von Bingen is now regarded as a
giant of her time, and Barbara Strozzi, an extraordinarily
inventive early baroque composer, awaits a fuller exploration that
is likely to yield far richer dividends than the current interest
in Beach.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Q. I supervise a female salesperson who has hair
that extends to the middle of her back. She is excellent at her job
and is always professionally dressed. However, she wears her hair
loose, and when she leans over to do anything, it covers her face.
Then she throws it over her shoulder in a very distracting manner.
She constantly plays with it when talking, and I have noticed that
strangers are distracted by this. I praise her when her hair is
braided, but this is not often. How should I approach her? M.J.
</P>
<P>
   A. Unless you are actively seeking a hair-raising experience,
your best approach is not to approach her on this one. When you
meet with employees to discuss their personal habits or affections,
the most likely outcomes are defensiveness, resistance and
distress.
</P>
<P>
   By approaching her on this matter, you are in essence acting
like a parent and treating her like a child. As a manager, it makes
far more sense to act as an adult and treat your employees as
adults too. This means accepting their uniqueness and diversity,
and staying away from personal habits unless they are clearly
causing problems in terms of safety, health or performance.
</P>
<P>
   You have an excellent employee, and you are currently taking a
professional and adult approach by giving her positive feedback
when you feel that her hair is appropriate. This type of feedback
can have a strong motivational impact, and it may ultimately lead
to a close encounter with a hairstylist. In the meantime, do not
let her hair prevent you from seeing the many strengths that she
brings to the job.
</P>
<P>
   Q. A week ago, I was called into a meeting with my direct
supervisor and her manager. I was shocked when her manager spent
the entire session criticizing me. Her comments were trivial and
had nothing to do with my main responsibilities. My supervisor sat
there and said nothing during the meeting or even afterward.
There's no one I can go to about this, so what should I do? A.P.
</P>
<P>
   A. It sounds like you are in an organization that is not
organized at all. Part of your direct supervisor's job is to
provide you with regular performance-based feedback so that
problems can be corrected when they occur, leading to no shocking
endings. Her lack of support during the meeting and afterward
raises even more questions.
</P>
<P>
   Feedback should not come from someone who is marginally familiar
with you and your work. And feedback should be premised on clear,
specific and measurable performance factors, and not on trivial
generalizations.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you should meet with your direct supervisor and
express your concern over what happened. Indicate that you do not
want a repeat performance, and then suggest that you meet with her
on a regular basis to review your work. Tell her that you would
like such reviews to be documented and included in your file, along
with any written accolades that you may receive.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the big picture, you were unjustly berated by a
senior manager, and your direct supervisor went into hiding. This
does not exactly qualify for one of America's most desirable
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Q. Our department was recently reorganized and a well-liked
employee was laid off very suddenly. She received no notice or
severance pay. That leaves the rest of us, approximately 70
employees, nervous about our ``here today, gone tomorrow'' jobs. Do
you have any advice for us? P.W.
</P>
<P>
   A. The real advice is for you to consider giving some advice to
your employer. It is important for your employer to understand
that, as a result of this isolated layoff, there has been a major
decline in trust, loyalty and commitment, combined with a major
increase in insecurity, anxiety and dissatisfaction. This can
further lead to increases in absenteeism and turnover, and
decreases in creativity and productivity.
</P>
<P>
   It is not the actual layoff that caused these problems, as many
companies implement layoffs for any number of legitimate business
reasons. The problem has been caused by the lack of communication
and support associated with the layoff, and the current lack of
information as to future employment objectives.
</P>
<P>
   At this point, you and some of your associates should consider
meeting with management to let them know that although you
understand the rationale behind layoffs, the lack of information
regarding the company's plans in this area is creating widespread
problems, many of which could be solved through increased two-way
communication.
</P>
<P>
   Layoffs are not pleasant for the employees who are let go, and
it is important for management to understand that they are not
automatically pleasant for the employees who remain.

BRITISH PRIME MINISTER CALLS FOR UPDATED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By AGIS SALPUKAS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain on Monday urged
a revamping of the way the world's financial institutions deal with
global economic turmoil, and said the procedures of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank had to be updated.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that the IMF and the World Bank, set up 54 years ago at
a conference in Bretton Woods, N.H., ``were constructed for a world
of fixed exchange rates and capital controls, when capital flows
were much smaller.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The current crisis illustrated the weakness of the existing
international financial system,'' Blair said. ``It needs to be
modernized to meet the challenges of a new century.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reform there has got to be,'' he said, departing from his text
and glancing up at the group of 24 top executives and other
officials in the ornate boardroom of the New York Stock Exchange.
Many were sunk deep in leather chairs around a huge table, the
walls adorned with portraits of past Exchange chairmen.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should not be afraid to think radically and
fundamentally,'' Blair told the group, which listened silently,
then rose to applaud him at the end and followed him to a luncheon.
He cut short his speech since he was running late after speaking at
the United Nations, where he urged greater world cooperation
against terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister, who is the current chairman of the Group of
Seven leading industrial nations, said he was considering calling a
meeting of the group's government leaders to push for the reforms.
</P>
<P>
   Blair outlined a series of changes that he believed were needed
to deal with the current and future global economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   He said there was a need for greater openness and transparency,
which would include the setting up of international accounting
standards. He welcomed an attempt by the IMF to come up with a code
on more fiscal openness.
</P>
<P>
   He also called for improving financial supervision and
regulation and said that the IMF and the World Bank needed to give
this a much higher priority.
</P>
<P>
   The world, he continued, had to develop better ways to respond
to a short-term crisis of liquidity when a country has trouble
converting its money into other currencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IMF does not and cannot play this role _ the finance it
provides is strictly limited and is usually provided in return for
specific demands negotiated over a period of time,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF, which has lent about $25 billion in the past year, has
run into sharp criticism in nations like Thailand, Indonesia and
South Korea, where its aid has been coupled with requirements for
tough changes such as closing down weak financial institutions.
Interest rates have also been pushed up sharply in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, governments have been forced to cut spending, which
led to the killing of social programs and public works programs.
</P>
<P>
   Blair noted that the vast flows of capital in the current
economic crisis posed some new challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is vital that global investors assess more carefully the
risks associated with their lending decisions and price their loans
accordingly,'' he said. ``We need a new mechanism to insure close
and regular contact between governments and the private sector that
can provide early warning of problems.''
</P>
<P>
   He also called for greater openness and accountability by
international financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to see improved openness in procedures and more
systematic external evaluations of IMF policies,'' he said. ``It is
important, too, that programs should take full account of their
impact on the poorest sections of society.''
</P>
<P>
   He said that to put through the current reforms ``we will have
to reach out to a wider community _ both the developing nations and
outside experts _ including financiers, economists and
businessmen.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair said the resources of the IMF needed to be strengthened.
Last week some members of Congress blocked a move by President
Clinton to increase the funding of the IMF.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When a friend lost weight, Monica Lewinsky was
properly enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay. I hate you ... You little-size-6-bitch,'' Lewinsky wrote
by e-mail. ``I don't know if I can be friends with you anymore!!!!!
That's nice. I'm a 10-12 so that makes me double your size.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky portrayed in 3,183 pages of grand jury testimony,
e-mails, love notes and other evidence complied by Independent
Counsel Kenneth Starr is a young woman by turns funny and sad,
naive and savvy, manipulative and manipulated, likeable and
loathsome, and profane and promiscuous _ but always profoundly
human.
</P>
<P>
   She quickly built a rapport with the grand jury hearing her
testimony about her White House affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica, none of us in this room are perfect,'' one juror
reassures her. ``We all fall and we fall several times a day. The
only difference between my age and when I was your age is now I get
up faster.''
</P>
<P>
   The star witness had asked the jurors to call her ``Monica''
rather than ``Miss Lewinsky,'' explaining, ``I'm just 25.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll always be Miss Lewinsky, whether you're 25 or 28 or
...,'' a juror pointed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not if I get married,'' she popped back hopefully.
</P>
<P>
   In the e-mail correspondence with Catherine Davis, a longtime
friend who was living in Japan, Lewinsky emerges as a realist as
well as a romantic _ and clearly a member of a younger generation
than the Baby Boomer president entering his 50s.
</P>
<P>
   She jokes that Clinton can't comprehend that her telephone
caller ID displays ``POTUS'' (president of the United States) when
he calls, and seems proud of himself when he finds a White House
phone that fools the system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jeez, I hate being called 'dear','' she complains to ``Cat.''
``The creep calls me that sometimes. It's an old person's
saying!!!!''
</P>
<P>
   In pressuring the president for help in finding a job in New
York, she said a news position at MTV would be nice or ``anything
at George magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   She wasn't as lovestruck as she appeared to be Starr's summary
to Congress. While she professed to love the president, Lewinsky
hardly pined away in her Watergate apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did I tell you I had sex with Thomas last week,'' she said in
a 1997 e-mail. ``I know. I am so naughty ... I went over there with
some ice cream and pretty much seduced him in a way that made him
put the moves on me ... cool or what???''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a good time at the spa (I did it with the nutrition
guy)!!!!'' she writes another time. ``I kinda don't want to get
into the juicies on e-mail.''
</P>
<P>
   She anticipates going to a black tie gala where ``hopefully
we'll meet some interesting people. A cute boy would be VERY
nice.''
</P>
<P>
   Weight came up nearly as often as sex in Lewinsky's world.
Indeed, she said her extra pounds are the reason she never cleaned
the infamous semen-stained dress that provided genetic proof of her
relationship with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I gained weight so I couldn't wear the dress and it didn't
fit. And I'm not a very organized person. I don't clean my clothes
until I'm going to wear them again,'' she told the grand jury. When
she dropped a few pounds, she remembered the dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't keep the dress as a souvenir. I was going to wear it
on Thanksgiving and my cousins, who I always try to look skinny for
because they are all skinny,'' she said. But Linda Tripp _ who
brought the affair to Starr's attention and gave him tapes of phone
calls in which Lewinsky discussed it _ discouraged her.
</P>
<P>
   ``She brought me one of her jackets from her thinner closet,''
Lewinsky recalled cattily.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors questioned Lewinsky diligently, but over the
weeks of her testimony they seemed to grow more personable and
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Do you still love the president?'' one juror asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Monday, I would have said yes,'' Lewinsky, referring to
Aug. 17, when Clinton addressed the nation after being interrogated
by Starr. `` It was very painful for me to watch his speech on
Monday night. It's hard for me to feel that he has characterized
this relationship as a service contract. ...That all I did was
perform oral sex on him and that that's all this relationship was.
And it was a lot more than that to me ...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you and the president ever engage in sexual relations
using cigars?'' one juror asked gingerly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay. I'd like to change the subject now,'' said the juror.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank you,'' said Lewinsky. ``Just once. Just once.''
</P>
<P>
   One juror chided her that Clinton ``was a married man and it
wasn't no secret of that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not right to have an affair with a married man,''
Lewinsky admitted. ``I never expected to fall in love with the
president. I was surprised that I did.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end, Lewinsky had clearly established a rapport with the
jurors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope you won't have to come back her any more,'' the
foreperson told her. ``But we wanted to offer you a bouquet of good
wishes that include luck, success, happiness and blessings.''

 &HT;    E-MAIL MESSAGES NOT SAFE FROM INVESTIGATORS' EYES, LEWINSKY
FOUND
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Released Monday as part of 2,800 pages of
Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr's supporting evidence, Monica
Lewinsky's e-mail messages read like a transcript of private
late-night chats with trusted friends.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, a distraught Lewinsky dashes off a message to a
friend in Japan: ``So it's over. I don't know what I will do now
but I can't wait anymore and I can't go through all this crap
anymore. In some ways, I hope I don't hear from him (Clinton)
again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Lewinsky composed e-mail messages so personal
and candid it's unlikely she ever envisioned that anyone but her
friends would read them. But unlike telephone conversations, which
must be recorded to be preserved, e-mail messages automatically
live on in computer hard drives _ even if people who send them
don't realize it. For that reason, investigators are turning more
frequently to retrieved e-mail as evidence in court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using e-mail as a substitute for telephone calls,''
said James X. Dempsey, senior staff counsel at the Washington-based
Center for Democracy and Technology. ``But they are also creating
records that are being used in civil and criminal proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt e-mail usage is skyrocketing. According to a
1998 Forrester Research Inc. report, for example, 15 percent of the
U.S. adult population, or about 30 million people, use e-mail. And
that figure is expected to surge to 135 million people by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, e-mail messages have the same protection as
first-class letters or phone calls. They cannot be intercepted in
transmission without a court order unless there is evidence of
wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
   The catch occurs when e-mail messages are stored _ and they
become documents. They're stored either on the hard drive of the
sender or recipient, or on the hard drive of an inhouse server or
an Internet service providers (ISP), such as America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all messages obtained by the government are from stored
e-mail, not transmitted e-mail,'' Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to delete e-mail messages from a hard drive, but
they don't usually disappear until they're over-written.
</P>
<P>
   At the onset of the Iran-Contra debacle, for example, National
Security Adviser John Poindexter went into his office one weekend
to delete 5,012 of his 5,062 stored messages. Oliver North erased
750 of his 758 messages. Still, these messages were recovered and
included as evidence because a low-level White House employee
decided not to overwrite backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civil servant decided somebody might come looking for those
messages, `` said Tom Blanton, director of the non-profit National
Security Archive at George Washington University and author of
``White House e-mail: The Top Secret Computer Messages The
Reagan-Bush White House Tried to Destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial ISPs, such as AOL, also must turn over messages if
ordered to do so by courts. Tricia Primrose, AOL's spokeswoman,
said the company has a policy of giving customers 10 days' notice
in civil proceedings. It turns over records immediately in criminal
investigations. AOL keeps e-mail messages on its servers for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing about e-mail is that it's got the immediacy of
a conversation but the permanence of a letter,'' says Blanton.
``Generally you don't want to write anything you wouldn't want to
see on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Lewinsky never got that advice.

VOTING RECORDS EASY TARGET IN CALIFORNIA RACES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT SALLADAY  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO, Calif. _ Attorney General Dan Lungren and Sen.
Barbara Boxer stand on different ideological continents, but both
candidates have the same problem: They have records that can be
exploited.
</P>
<P>
   With just seven weeks before the Nov. 3 election, a parallel
dynamic has emerged in the race for California governor and U.S.
Senate, and it's an underground theme that will run through
Election Day.
</P>
<P>
   Voters can expect Lungren _ the Republican nominee for governor
_ and Boxer _ a Democrat seeking her second term in the Senate _ to
share a common campaign strategy by painting their opponents as
talkers, not doers, as politicians who have never made tough
decisions.
</P>
<P>
   Lungren and Boxer also can expect to get hit repeatedly for
their extensive records in Congress, where almost every vote is
posted on the Internet and special partisan committees in
Washington scour official records for political ammunition.
</P>
<P>
   Those same records, sometimes distorted, helped savage the
candidacy of Rep. Jane Harman during the Democratic gubernatorial
primary against millionaire Al Checchi, who did most of the
distorting, and Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, who handily beat them both.
</P>
<P>
   It's a theme likely to be played out again Wednesday, when
Lungren and Davis meet in Sacramento for their third televised
debate. Mark Petracca, chairman of the political science department
at the University of California at Irvine, said Lungren's only
counterattack is to ``turn the record into a badge of honor by
saying, `You may not like all of the decisions I've made, but I've
been in a position for years to make the tough calls.'''
</P>
<P>
   Lungren and Boxer already have been using that strategy.
</P>
<P>
   Davis repeatedly has attacked Lungren's record during the decade
he spent in Congress and his eight years as attorney general. And
Lungren has been hitting Davis for doing little while holding
administrative positions like state controller and lieutenant
governor, after serving a scant three years in the state Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the fact of the matter is, you keep talking and you never
act,'' Lungren pointedly told Davis during their second televised
debate on Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   During the first debate, Lungren slammed Davis for missing a
meeting in Mexico of the California World Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't show up, you didn't send anybody there,'' Lungren
said. ``So, I mean, the question is: Do you just talk or are you
going to do something?''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Lungren ridiculed Davis for having ``17 employees and
nothing else to do.'' In fact, Lungren, who controls about 5,000
employees at the state Department of Justice, mentioned three times
that Davis employs only 17 people as lieutenant governor.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise when Boxer met her opponent, state Treasurer Matt Fong,
for the first time in a debate, she carried the same theme, vaguely
deriding his public service when compared to her career in
Congress. A private attorney, Fong joined the Board of Equalization
in 1990, his first political post, and was elected state treasurer
in 1994. In the past 22 years, Boxer has been a Marin County
supervisor, member of the House of Representatives and senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Fong has been a treasurer,'' she said, ``and he's been on
the Board of Equalization, so he hasn't really voted on a lot of
the issues that will come before the Senate. So we've had to read
his speeches and listen to his statements.''
</P>
<P>
   The Lungren campaign has seized upon Davis' public record as a
way to sharpen the differences between two similar candidates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters were told as soon as the primary election concluded
that these two are very much alike in a lot of ways,'' said Dave
Puglia, Lungren's campaign manager. ``Well, it's not true. ... Gray
Davis in his public career has managed to do little and avoid
controversy. Dan Lungren has taken controversy head-on.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Davis, Michael Bustamante, admitted that
Lungren's record in Congress is a ``target-rich environment.''
Lungren cast 4,800 votes while in Congress. During their second
debate together, for example, Davis could quickly cite 14 votes
Lungren made while in Congress on one very specific topic: denying
abortions even in the case of rape or incest.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Davis and Fong campaigns say their candidates have long
public service records from which voters can make informed
decisions. And Bustamante said Lungren doesn't mention Davis'
accomplishments because there is nothing the average Californian
would find objectionable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact of the matter is the guy (Lungren) is embarrassed
about his record and he's trying to run away from it,'' Bustamante
said. ``Gray's record over the past two decades has been very
clear.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' campaign slogan during the June primary was ``Experience
money can't buy,'' when he faced two wealthy candidates. He has now
changed it to ``Experience that will move us forward.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Fong spokesman Steve Schmidt said Fong was ``the chief financial
officer of the world's seventh largest economy'' and even though he
may not have a long voting record, voters can count on him to keep
his word. ``Voters can expect Matt Fong to follow through,''
Schmidt said.
</P>
<P>
   The Fong campaign, with the help of the National Republican
Senatorial Committee, has amassed a databank on Boxer's voting
career. When Boxer said during the first debate that she supported
a tough sentencing law called ``10-20-life,'' the Fong campaign
immediately produced a roll-call vote from Nov. 9, 1993, on an
amendment to the federal crime bill. Boxer had voted ``no.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A voting record is only a liability if it's a bad voting
record,'' Schmidt said. ``Barbara Boxer has been in Congress for a
long time; she's cast lots of votes. ... We're looking at it very
closely. We're looking for a pattern of flip-flopping and
unprincipled stands.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy Behr, a Boxer campaign strategist and spokesman, said the
campaign must rely on Fong's public statements, and they indeed
take him at his word, as when Fong said he thought Roe vs. Wade,
the landmark abortion-right decision, was wrongly decided.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters understand that sometimes campaigns can twist a voting
record,'' Behr said, ``so they don't necessarily give more credence
to a vote than a statement.''

 &HT;    Fellow Democrats: Just between us, it's time to let Clinton go
 &HT;    By Jay Bookman
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   The tapes were a bust.
</P>
<P>
   The video testimony of President Clinton proved that he
committed perjury and probably suborned perjury from his secretary,
Bettie Currie. It also proved that independent counsel Kenneth
Starr has an unhealthy interest in the sex lives of other people.
But we already knew all that.
</P>
<P>
   So let's take this discussion in another direction. Let's see if
we can elevate the debate a bit by focusing on two questions:
</P>
<P>
   _ What is the purpose of politics?
</P>
<P>
   _ What role should principle play in politics?
</P>
<P>
   Before we begin, I'd like to ask all of those folks who have
disliked Clinton from the beginning to find something else to read.
Nothing personal, but I want this to be a little heart-to-heart
among those of us who have voted for Clinton and support his
policies. The rest of us will wait while you guys turn the page. .
. . Thanks.
</P>
<P>
   Have they left yet? Good. I bet they're off sticking more pins
in their Bill Clinton voodoo dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Now that we're alone _ remember the joy of Election Night, 1992?
After eight years of Ronald Reagan and four of George Bush, Clinton
seemed like an oasis of sanity. And once the Republican takeover of
1994 elevated Newt Gingrich to the House speaker's job, things got
downright scary. Clinton's presidency became even more important.
</P>
<P>
   Ever since, on issues such as the environment, women's rights,
racial justice and maintaining some sense of balance in the
nation's tax code, Clinton is all we've had to cling to. And wily
politician that he is, he's been enough. Time and again he has
beaten the conservatives, usually because they underestimated how
much support his policies really have among the American people.
</P>
<P>
   And the more successful Clinton became, the more the
conservatives hated him. The more they hated him and attacked him,
the more protective the rest of us became. Because at times, it
seemed that Bill Clinton was the only thing standing between us and
the Christian Theocracy of America.
</P>
<P>
   That history makes it all the more difficult now to argue for
Clinton's resignation and perhaps impeachment. Many times, when
discussing this issue with friends, I've heard the same bottom
line: ``But how can we let the Republicans ruin him?''
</P>
<P>
   I understand and respect that. The claim by House Republicans
that the Clinton tapes would be ``devastating'' only proves how
blinded by hatred they have become. Their judgment is gone.
</P>
<P>
   But I too have a question:
</P>
<P>
   If this were a Republican president, what would we be doing?
</P>
<P>
   We'd all be screaming for his head, that's what.
</P>
<P>
   We'd be pointing out that here was a man in power who had used a
young intern like a soulless receptacle, who had reduced his
secretary to little more than a procuress, who had clearly
pressured that secretary to lie under oath and who had weakened the
presidency to conceal a lie.
</P>
<P>
   To support Clinton despite all that requires us to repudiate
what we once claimed to believe about the way men and women should
treat each other in the workplace. At the very least we have to
pretend that such misbehavior isn't really a big deal, that it's
all right to use a woman as long as the woman wants to be used.
</P>
<P>
   So let's talk now about those two lofty questions.
</P>
<P>
   If politics is just a struggle for power between our gang and
their gang, and if principle is simply a convenient hammer to pound
on the other guy's head, then we ought to defend Clinton with every
means available. After all, he's our guy and they're attacking him,
in ways that are clearly unfair.
</P>
<P>
   But what if politics is something more than that? What if
politics is a means of producing a better society, a more decent
society? What if principles are more than just weapons to use
against bad guys?
</P>
<P>
   By continuing to support Clinton, we place ourselves in the
hypocritical position of demanding a higher standard of behavior
from our enemies than we do from our friends. Someday, believe it
or not, this is all going to end. And I'm afraid that on that
glorious day, we'll look back and realize that the price we paid to
save Clinton just wasn't worth it.
</P>
<P>
   (Oh, and for you conservatives who are still hanging around
reading this, shame, shame, shame. Really folks, read the polls.
You gotta stop sticking your nose in other people's private
business.)

CLINTON, AT U.N., SEEKS GREATER COOPERATION IN FIGHTING TERRORISM  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton told world leaders Monday
that the fight against terrorism was ``at the top of the U.S.
agenda,'' and proposed steps for better international cooperation
to prevent and punish attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly that was generally flat
and listless, an unsmiling Clinton nevertheless struck a theme _
the need for a global effort to combat terrorism. Similar
sentiments found voice Monday as a number of world leaders gathered
here to address the Assembly. The session was surrounded by
unusually high security in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton said, ``We must show people they have
everything to gain by embracing cooperation and renouncing
violence. This is not simply an American or a Western
responsibility; it is the world's responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be asking Congress for more money to strengthen
protection for American embassies abroad and for programs to help
countries under terrorist threat improve the lives of their own
people and thus lower the pool for terrorist recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   His audience knew that if he looked preoccupied, which he did,
it was because he was in the awkward position of addressing the
United Nations at the same time that a videotape of his testimony
to a grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter was
playing on television screens and computer monitors around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Some television banks here were playing his speech and the
videotape at once.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a warm, standing ovation with rhythmic clapping
as he entered the General Assembly hall this morning, a sign of the
sympathy many foreign delegates felt for him. Many diplomats
reflected the views of commentators around the world who have
expressed shock in recent days that the United States was putting
itself, and the president, through this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, really sad,'' an envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Berger, the national security adviser, told reporters in
a briefing Monday that the warm reception the president received
was a surprise. ``None of us expected that kind of response. We had
not seen that before.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton paused at the start of his speech to thank the General
Assembly for ``your very kind and generous welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of his address, the applause was more polite and
less enthusiastic. Clinton did not advance American policy against
terrorism in any new directions, nor did he deal with rising
criticisms from a number of countries regarding the American
missile attack on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on Aug. 20,
which the United States linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born
supporter of Islamic militancy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's speech followed by half an hour an opening
address by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who obliquely criticized
the American use of force, which the administration said was a
retaliation for terrorist bombings of American embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism is a global menace, which clearly calls for global
action,'' Annan said. ``Individual actions by member states,
whether aimed at state or non-state actors, cannot in themselves
provide a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his remarks about a global response, suggested
improvements in a number of areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and should
be at the top of the world agenda, what then are the concrete steps
we can take together to protect our common destiny?'' the president
said. ``What are our common obligations? At least, I believe, they
are these:
</P>
<P>
   ``To give terrorists no support, no sanctuary, no financial
assistance,'' he said. ``To bring pressure on states that do. To
act together to step up extradition and prosecution. To sign the
global anti-terror convention. To strengthen the biological weapons
and chemical conventions. To enforce the chemical weapons
convention. To promote stronger domestic laws and control the
manufacture and export of explosives. To raise international
standards for airport security. To combat the conditions that
spread violence and despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for strengthening of biological and chemical
weapons conventions will be welcomed by arms control groups, which
say that the Administration is allowing the Pentagon to weaken the
chemical treaty. International efforts to bolster the biological
pact have lagged without strong American action.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Clinton's remarks on international cooperation
against terrorist organizations found an echo in a speech Monday by
Chandrika Kumaratunga, the president of Sri Lanka, a country where
more than a decade of ethnic warfare has hobbled what was once the
most rapidly developing of South Asian nations and cost tens of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga warned global leaders to be ``eternally vigilant to
insure that terrorists do not find loopholes in our laws or use
procedural delays to circumvent the emerging international
consensus against terrorism.'' She mentioned front organizations
set up with ostensibly humanitarian goals that officials say funnel
money to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka, which
is fighting to carve out a piece of the island's northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, also sounded the theme of
monitoring attempts by terrorists to find new ways to finance their
activities from abroad. Calling terrorism a ``uniquely barbaric and
cowardly crime,'' he invited world leaders to London to discuss
ways to thwart terrorist fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective new measures on an agreed international basis could
make a real difference,'' said Blair, who is working to maintain a
peace agreement in Northern Ireland, which has suffered years of
bombings and other sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his speech, reiterated his Administration's
insistence that the fight against terrorism was not part of a clash
of civilization between the United States and the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this view is terribly wrong,'' Clinton said. ``False
prophets may use and abuse any religion to justify whatever
political objectives they have, even cold-blooded murder. Some may
have the world believe that almighty God himself, the merciful,
grants a license to kill. But that is not our understanding of
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A quarter of the world's population is Muslim, from Africa to
the Middle East, to Asia and to the United States, where Islam is
one of our fastest growing faiths,'' he said. ``There are over 1200
mosques and Islamic centers in the United States, and the number is
rapidly increasing. The six million Americans who worship there
will tell you there is no inherent clash between Islam and America.
Americans respect and honor Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not talk about paying debts to the organization,
disappointing members of Congress who were prepared to challenge
his repeated efforts to blame them for the failure to pay. The
United States is the biggest debtor, with outstanding payments of
more than $1.5 billion to the United Nations, and faces the loss of
voting rights in the General Assembly at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, the president met with the secretary-general
to discuss the American arrears, which remain entangled with
abortion legislation in Congress, said Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, in his speech, was forthright about the issue. He said
that the organization was in a ``financial straightjacket'' that
hindered reforms demanded by Congress and from other quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial stringency is a feature of today's world,'' Annan
said. ``It has helped concentrate our minds on giving you better
value for your money. But without money there can be no value.
Stringency is one thing, and a starvation diet quite another.''

ANALYSIS: SMOKING GUN OR POPGUN? VIEWERS SAW WHAT THEY WANTED TO
SEE  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By R.W. APPLE Jr.    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's belatedly televised grand jury
testimony _ breathlessly advertised as explosive in its content,
but much less so in reality _ is unlikely to change many minds.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, people are likely to find reinforcement in it for their
previously formed viewpoints. Members of Congress began doing
precisely that as soon as the testimony, which was taped on Aug.
17, had been broadcast; some who watched swore they had seen a
smoking gun, while others saw only a popgun.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have felt that Starr was unfairly hounding the
president, or that the whole case was built upon an unfair
intrusion into his private life, will doubtless find ample support
in the dogged pursuit of the president by questioners seemingly
determined to find inconsistencies in his account, and by their
concentration on Clinton's sexual relationships to the exclusion of
other matters the grand jury has investigated, including
Whitewater.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, those especially condemnatory of Clinton's
sexual behavior, those who see him as a man who habitually resorts
to weasel words when cornered or those who believe he has committed
perjury, will find evidence to buttress their cases. Some things he
said appeared to conflict directly with the testimony of other
witnesses questioned by the grand jury, including not only Ms.
Lewinsky but White House aides and security officers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, one thing is beyond debate, and that could produce
political benefits for the president: Despite expectations to the
contrary, in large part raised by the news media, the testimony
contained few explicit sexual terms, and none that had not already
been used in the Starr report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The four hours of testimony constituted a performance radically
different from the four-minute speech to the nation Clinton made
later that same day.
</P>
<P>
   In the speech, Clinton's apologies sounded forced, he spent much
of his energy attacking the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and
he all but ignored Monica Lewinsky, the young woman with whom he
acknowledged an ``inappropriate'' relationship. But in the
testimony, recorded earlier, he gave fuller and more convincing
voice to his regrets, spoke fondly of Ms. Lewinsky and largely
refrained from attacking the costly Starr investigation.
</P>
<P>
   So great is the discrepancy that it raises the question: Why did
Clinton choose not to make a speech that echoed the far more
winning tone of his testimony? Had he done so, he might well have
put the whole matter to rest, as even his political foes said in
the days leading up to the speech.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, almost everyone, including members of his own staff,
bitterly criticized the speech, and its failure added impetus to
calls for Clinton's resignation or impeachment, which were still
scattered at that time.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was occasionally belligerent in refusing to answer
questions, and his anger was betrayed at times by a stabbing
finger, a scowl or a raised eyebrow. But he kept his emotions under
tight rein and he neither uttered profanity nor threatened to walk
out of the session with Starr's team, as some had whispered he had
done.
</P>
<P>
   The president at times sounded as if he was speaking not only to
the grand jury but to the nation at large _ as, indeed, it turned
out he would be. He seemed determined to look dignified and
reasonable, and he came close to stating explicitly that he
expected the videotape to be made public eventually.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the least ``presidential'' aspect of the testimony was
Clinton's rigorously legalistic answers _ his relentless, at times
almost ludicrous, insistence upon defining everyday words in the
narrowest possible way, to his own advantage. He applied that
technique to words like ``sex,'' of course, but also to ``is'' and
``alone.'' That could hurt on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the best news for the president was Ms. Lewinsky's
statement, in supporting documents issued by Starr's office Monday,
that no one had told her to lie or offered her a job as an
incentive to keep quiet.
</P>
<P>
   That could help on Capitol Hill. But the votes there are still
likely to turn most decisively on the question of whether Clinton
committed perjury in testifying to the grand jury. In his
testimony, Clinton said that touching Ms. Lewinsky's breasts or
genital area directly would constitute ``sexual relations'' of the
kind he denies having had with her. Her testimony, however,
includes graphic accounts of several such incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canaday, R-Fla., who sits on the Judiciary
Committee (and who, like Clinton, graduated from the Yale
University Law School), said that he remained convinced that
perjury in grand jury testimony remained cause for impeachment, and
most of his Republican colleagues have said the same. Unless some
change their minds, a vote to authorize a full-blown impeachment
inquiry seems likely before Congress adjourns, probably early next
month, for the November elections.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whatever happens after that, the Lewinsky matter has lengthened
a trail of shattered political illusions and frayed political bonds
that began, one might say, 35 years ago this fall when John F.
Kennedy was assassinated. Since then, almost every major American
political institution has lost the confidence of a large segment of
the public, making governing ever more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Further assassinations and assassination attempts, the Vietnam
War, the Watergate scandal, the Iran-contra affair and innumerable
other events have destroyed the largely trusting relationship that
once existed between Washington and the rest of the country. Voter
participation has dropped and is still dropping. Only Ronald Reagan
among the last seven presidents, and he only to a limited extent,
managed to reverse these trends.
</P>
<P>
   Journalism has lost much of its credibility for concentrating
too much, in the view of the rank-and-file, on the negative and the
scandalous, notably in the Lewinsky, Whitewater and other Clinton
controversies. Congress has been pilloried for putting partisanship
before patriotism. The independent counsel statute, passed to
insure impartiality in the application of the law to people in high
places, has come to be seen as a tool of inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   And the occupants of the presidency have frittered away the
reputation for truth-telling and square-shooting that constituted
one of the precious legacies of George Washington and Abraham
Lincoln. The public may still approve of Bill Clinton's performance
as president, it may think he should finish his term, but
relatively few people any longer admire him or his values. That
will inevitably lower expectations about his successors, at a
moment when the nation's expectations of government probity are
dangerously low already.

BOSTON POPS FEATURED IN AMERICAN AIRLINES ADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS REIDY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ In return for free publicity, the Boston Pops and
conductor Keith Lockhart are appearing in American Airlines TV ads
that began running Monday and will continue for six weeks.
</P>
<P>
   While the Boston institution has often lent its name to worthy
causes, this will mark the first time in its 113-year history that
the Pops have been involved in advertising for a commercial product
or service, said Mark Volpe, managing director of the Boston
Symphony Orchestra, parent of the Pops.
</P>
<P>
   In return for travel considerations, the Pops have had a
promotional relationship with American for about a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is taking that relationship to the next level,'' Volpe
said of the first appearance by the Pops in a TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of the classical music scene with stops in Baltimore,
Minneapolis, and Detroit, Volpe said he was unaware of an orchestra
ever playing so prominent a role in a TV ad.
</P>
<P>
   Some airlines run the same ads in every city that the airline
serves. But American devotes part of its marketing budget to ads
that highlight individual cities, such as New York and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The ads using the Pops are the first time that American has
created an ad specifically for Boston, said James K. Carter,
American's regional sales director for New England.
</P>
<P>
   A TV ad opens with scenes of Beacon Hill, a rower sculling on
the Charles River, and Pops musicians moving through an airport.
</P>
<P>
   On an airplane, a Pops musician sits next to her cello as a
flight attendant gets a pillow for the instrument. The cellist
later plays the airlines' theme, ``Something Special in the Air.''
</P>
<P>
   Most travelers think of American as an airline that serves the
South and Midwest, but American has recently ramped up its flights
from Logan International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   By including scenes from Paris and San Francisco, the Pops ad
conveys the message that American is a good choice for Boston
travelers who may want to fly to the West Coast or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The ad was created by Temerlin McClain, a Texas ad agency that
said one reason for using the Pops is to connect American with a
``Boston icon that means quality and dependability.''
</P>
<P>
   The campaign includes radio ads as well as print ads that use
such landmarks as the Old North Church and the USS Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to be specific, American said it will spend ``several
hundred thousand dollars'' on the Boston campaign.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Lockhart outdoes Liberace, who once reduced a
Tchaikovsky piano concerto into a four-minute performance. Lockhart
has condensed a Rossini overture into a mere 60 seconds for the
American ad.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Pops musicians were paid union-scale wages to appear in
the American Airlines ad, Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why the Pops agreed to appear in an ad, he said:
``Candidly, this gets the Pops out there in front of the public,
and there's no such thing as overexposure.''

CLINTON, AT U.N., SEEKS GREATER COOPERATION IN FIGHTING TERRORISM

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ President Clinton told world leaders Monday
that the fight against terrorism was ``at the top of the U.S.
agenda,'' and proposed steps for better international cooperation
to prevent and punish attacks.
</P>
<P>
   In a speech to the U.N. General Assembly that was generally flat
and listless, an unsmiling Clinton nevertheless struck a theme _
the need for a global effort to combat terrorism. Similar
sentiments found voice Monday as a number of world leaders gathered
here to address the Assembly. The session was surrounded by
unusually high security in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   In his address, Clinton said, ``We must show people they have
everything to gain by embracing cooperation and renouncing
violence. This is not simply an American or a Western
responsibility; it is the world's responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he would be asking Congress for more money to strengthen
protection for American embassies abroad and for programs to help
countries under terrorist threat improve the lives of their own
people and thus lower the pool for terrorist recruitment.
</P>
<P>
   His audience knew that if he looked preoccupied, which he did,
it was because he was in the awkward position of addressing the
United Nations at the same time that a videotape of his testimony
to a grand jury investigating the Monica Lewinsky matter was
playing on television screens and computer monitors around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Some television banks here were playing his speech and the
videotape at once.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton received a warm, standing ovation with rhythmic clapping
as he entered the General Assembly hall this morning, a sign of the
sympathy many foreign delegates felt for him. Many diplomats
reflected the views of commentators around the world who have
expressed shock in recent days that the United States was putting
itself, and the president, through this ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is sad, really sad,'' an envoy said.
</P>
<P>
   Samuel Berger, the national security adviser, told reporters in
a briefing Monday that the warm reception the president received
was a surprise. ``None of us expected that kind of response. We had
not seen that before.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton paused at the start of his speech to thank the General
Assembly for ``your very kind and generous welcome.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of his address, the applause was more polite and
less enthusiastic. Clinton did not advance American policy against
terrorism in any new directions, nor did he deal with rising
criticisms from a number of countries regarding the American
missile attack on targets in Sudan and Afghanistan on Aug. 20,
which the United States linked to Osama bin Laden, a Saudi-born
supporter of Islamic militancy.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Clinton's speech followed by half an hour an opening
address by Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who obliquely criticized
the American use of force, which the administration said was a
retaliation for terrorist bombings of American embassies in
Nairobi, Kenya and Dar Es Salaam, Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terrorism is a global menace, which clearly calls for global
action,'' Annan said. ``Individual actions by member states,
whether aimed at state or non-state actors, cannot in themselves
provide a solution.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his remarks about a global response, suggested
improvements in a number of areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``If terrorism is at the top of the American agenda and should
be at the top of the world agenda, what then are the concrete steps
we can take together to protect our common destiny?'' the president
said. ``What are our common obligations? At least, I believe, they
are these:
</P>
<P>
   ``To give terrorists no support, no sanctuary, no financial
assistance,'' he said. ``To bring pressure on states that do. To
act together to step up extradition and prosecution. To sign the
global anti-terror convention. To strengthen the biological weapons
and chemical conventions. To enforce the chemical weapons
convention. To promote stronger domestic laws and control the
manufacture and export of explosives. To raise international
standards for airport security. To combat the conditions that
spread violence and despair.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's call for strengthening of biological and chemical
weapons conventions will be welcomed by arms control groups, which
say that the Administration is allowing the Pentagon to weaken the
chemical treaty. International efforts to bolster the biological
pact have lagged without strong American action.
</P>
<P>
   The tone of Clinton's remarks on international cooperation
against terrorist organizations found an echo in a speech Monday by
Chandrika Kumaratunga, the president of Sri Lanka, a country where
more than a decade of ethnic warfare has hobbled what was once the
most rapidly developing of South Asian nations and cost tens of
thousands of lives.
</P>
<P>
   Kumaratunga warned global leaders to be ``eternally vigilant to
insure that terrorists do not find loopholes in our laws or use
procedural delays to circumvent the emerging international
consensus against terrorism.'' She mentioned front organizations
set up with ostensibly humanitarian goals that officials say funnel
money to the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in Sri Lanka, which
is fighting to carve out a piece of the island's northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's prime minister, Tony Blair, also sounded the theme of
monitoring attempts by terrorists to find new ways to finance their
activities from abroad. Calling terrorism a ``uniquely barbaric and
cowardly crime,'' he invited world leaders to London to discuss
ways to thwart terrorist fund-raising.
</P>
<P>
   ``Effective new measures on an agreed international basis could
make a real difference,'' said Blair, who is working to maintain a
peace agreement in Northern Ireland, which has suffered years of
bombings and other sectarian violence.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his speech, reiterated his Administration's
insistence that the fight against terrorism was not part of a clash
of civilization between the United States and the Islamic world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe this view is terribly wrong,'' Clinton said. ``False
prophets may use and abuse any religion to justify whatever
political objectives they have, even cold-blooded murder. Some may
have the world believe that almighty God himself, the merciful,
grants a license to kill. But that is not our understanding of
Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A quarter of the world's population is Muslim, from Africa to
the Middle East, to Asia and to the United States, where Islam is
one of our fastest growing faiths,'' he said. ``There are over 1200
mosques and Islamic centers in the United States, and the number is
rapidly increasing. The six million Americans who worship there
will tell you there is no inherent clash between Islam and America.
Americans respect and honor Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not talk about paying debts to the organization,
disappointing members of Congress who were prepared to challenge
his repeated efforts to blame them for the failure to pay. The
United States is the biggest debtor, with outstanding payments of
more than $1.5 billion to the United Nations, and faces the loss of
voting rights in the General Assembly at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Before his speech, the president met with the secretary-general
to discuss the American arrears, which remain entangled with
abortion legislation in Congress, said Berger.
</P>
<P>
   Annan, in his speech, was forthright about the issue. He said
that the organization was in a ``financial straightjacket'' that
hindered reforms demanded by Congress and from other quarters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Financial stringency is a feature of today's world,'' Annan
said. ``It has helped concentrate our minds on giving you better
value for your money. But without money there can be no value.
Stringency is one thing, and a starvation diet quite another.''

3 BAY STATE HMOS GET TOP NATIONAL RANKING BY MAGAZINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX PHAM  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Three health maintenance organizations based in
Massachusetts grabbed the top three spots on Newsweek magazine's
third annual list of the 100 best managed care plans in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, Tufts Health Plan and HMO Blue of
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Massachusetts were ranked numbers one
to three, respectively, on the list published in the Sept. 28 issue
of Newsweek.
</P>
<P>
   The news came as a welcome respite to the state's HMOs, who like
their peers nationwide, are under heavy attack by angry consumers
and regulation-minded &UR;  &LR; politicians.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a lot of negative press about HMOs and subsequent
public distrust,'' said Patti Embry-Tautenhan, spokeswoman for
Harvard Pilgrim. ``So, I hope this article and survey reassures
people that, at least in Massachusetts, health care decisions are
being made based on what constitutes quality care.''
</P>
<P>
   New England is home to some of America's premier hospitals and
doctors, so it's no wonder that the state's HMOs also get high
marks, said Susan Connolly, principal at William M. Mercer, a
benefits consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Quality can come at a cost, however. Connolly notes that health
care costs in Massachusetts are higher than in the rest of the
nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're among the most expensive states in the country based on
per capita health care costs,'' said Connolly, who noted that
health plans in Massachusetts have very broad networks of hospitals
and doctors. While that gives patients better access to care, it
tends to deprive health plans of some leverage in bargaining for
volume discounts with health care providers.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly premiums in the Boston area are nearly $100 higher for
each family than the national average, according to Modern
Healthcare magazine, a trade publication.
</P>
<P>
   Among top-rated New England plans, Healthsource Massachusetts in
Worcester ranked number eight, United Health Care of New England in
Providence came in at number six and Fallon Community Health Plan
in Worcester number sixteen.
</P>
<P>
   The Newsweek rankings looked at how well health plans kept
members healthy, treat acute illness, and manage chronic illnesses
for adults and children. More than 200 health plans participated in
the survey, although some prominent HMOs declined to participate,
including Aetna U.S. Healthcare, Cigna HealthCare, and Prudential.

NASA ASKS FOR $660 MILLION TO BAIL OUT RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worried that trouble in Moscow is threatening its own dreams,
NASA wants to spend up to $660 million over five years to bail out
its Russian partner in building a planned international space
station, agency officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Key members of Congress immediately faulted the proposal as too
expensive, clouding the fate of the biggest science project of all
time. But NASA officials argued that the American and Russian
programs are now linked so intimately that the Russian effort must
be preserved lest the American space program suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In just two months, orbital construction is to start on the
sprawling outpost for astronauts, which is expected to cost more
than $40 billion. But even if the new bailout goes through and
keeps the Russians afloat, the station project is facing another
round of construction delays next year because of Russia's problems
in building a key part. The lag in that work will also have costly
repercussions for the nation's fleet of space shuttles, which are
to carry station elements into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Already, past delays have cut the flight rate of the winged
spaceships to unusually low levels, and NASA officials are
scrambling to find new shuttle payloads to compensate for looming
gaps in outpost construction.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rothenberg, associate administrator for space flight at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in an
interview that the new bid to save the Russians and the beleaguered
outpost is likely to cost about $1.2 billion, including the new
money for the Russians as well as about $540 million in new
American work such as modifying the shuttles so they can do more
station lifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a plan,'' he said of the Russia aid. ``No commitment
from anybody has been made'' to provide new funds.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said the space agency had already squeezed its own
$13.6 billion budget as far as possible to find emergency funds for
the outpost's rescue, and that it was eager for new money.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Rothenberg said, NASA wants to pay the Russians $60
million this fiscal year for new goods and services and then up to
$150 million a year over the next four years as an aid to station
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.2 billion in emergency money, Rothenberg said, was much
cheaper than losing Moscow's help altogether. ``Any alternative you
look at without the Russians would hit the program hard,''
Rothenberg said. Their absence, he said, would delay the outpost's
construction by years and add up to $2 billion in costs.
</P>
<P>
   But top members of Congress are questioning the new bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given NASA's track record, we are justifiably concerned and
skeptical,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, which oversees NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics go further, saying NASA officials should put the
whole station project on indefinite hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to stick with a failed strategy,'' James Oberg,
an American expert on the Russian space program, said in an
interview. He said the station's delays threaten to add billions of
dollars in hidden costs to NASA's shuttle operations. ``Next year's
shuttle schedule is entirely up in the air,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At worst, Oberg said, NASA could end up with a half-built
station with the Russians entirely out of the picture if their
downward spiral continues. He said it would be much better to pause
now and rethink the station venture from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for station cooperation arose in 1993 after the Cold
War. The Clinton administration saw Moscow's participation as an
important symbol of new cooperation between East and West.
Supporting the Russian program was also viewed as a way to keep
Russian space scientists employed in peaceful pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of close collaboration, ties between the
Russian and American space station efforts are now so extensive
that repercussions of Russia's financial turmoil have increasingly
roiled American plans, budgets and gear. Last month, for example,
Russia's main spaceport temporarily lost power because of unpaid
bills, postponing a number of rocket launchings and sending shock
waves through Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The situation ``is deteriorating,'' NASA told the White House in
a confidential briefing in late July that was made public by NASA
watch, an internet publisher.
</P>
<P>
   In the briefing, NASA said the Russian Space Agency needs $340
million this year to build parts for its share of the international
outpost, but so far had received only $20 million from its
government. The outlook for improvement ``is bleak,'' the
assessment said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Manber, managing director of Energia Ltd., the American
arm of a top Russian contractor making station parts, strongly
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophical question,'' he said in an interview, ``is
whether you maintain the illusion that the government of Russia can
keep its objectives or do you deal with Russian industry for goods
and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Washington has paid Moscow $742 million for
station-related work, Congressional experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the White House has taken to rejecting NASA requests
for new bailout funds to aid the Russians, so the agency has raided
its own budget. But criticism in Congress, among scientists and in
the aerospace community is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA needs to stop draining other vital programs to feed the
space station's voracious hunger for more money,'' Space News, an
industry publication, said in an editorial last month.

<P>
   The developing crisis in the International Space Station has
been overshadowed in the past year or so by the travails of its
wobbly predecessor, the Russian Mir outpost, which has suffered a
fire, navigation breakdowns and a collision with a supply ship.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, orbital construction of the follow-on station was to
begin in November 1997. But the threadbare Russians kept missing
deadlines. So the starting date slipped to June of this year and
then to November, a year later than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The outpost's first element, 43 feet long, paid for by the
United States and built by Russia, is now scheduled to ride into
space atop a Russian rocket roughly two months from now. Then, over
five or six years, scores of Russian rocket and American shuttle
launchings are to loft 500 tons of parts and supplies. When it is
finished, the outpost of laboratories and living areas nearly the
size of two football fields will orbit hundreds of miles above
earth, powered by huge arrays of solar-energy cells,
</P>
<P>
   Today, the main hurdle is not the station's first element, which
the Russians have ready to go for launching in November, nor the
second, which the Americans have ready to go for launching in
December. Rather, it is the third _ the first element to be
fabricated by Russia on its own. This so-called service module
would provide early living quarters and, more important, would
provide propellant tanks and thrusters to keep the craft in
position. It is officially set for launching in April but is still
unfinished and its fate is increasingly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   American experts say Russia needs up to $210 million to finish,
test and launch the key unit. It might be ready to fly in July
1999, at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, though, American officials are loath to send up the
first modules without confidence that the vital third one will show
up relatively soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   To aid the Russians, the space agency is now seeking to buy two
lifeboats for the station from Russian at a cost of roughly $100
million, Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will prime the pump,'' he said. Rothenberg insisted that
taking $100 million from other NASA programs was prudent and that
the money would eventually be paid back. The current goal, he
added, is to rush Moscow $60 million by the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, NASA is working on its own partial backup to the
Russian service module, a skeleton unit that would periodically
lift the outpost into a safer orbit. The agency is also preparing
to have the shuttles modified so their engines can aid the lifting
job.
</P>
<P>
   Things will be clearer after agency officials meet with the
Russians late this month, after which schedules will be recast, yet
again.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, most shuttle flights that NASA had planned for this
year for station construction. But delays cut this year's flights
from four to one. As a result, by the time Sen. John Glenn rockets
into space in October, there will have been no shuttle launchings
for five months, a silence on the launching pad that NASA officials
say is dangerous. They say the rocket specialists at the Florida
spaceport must loft shuttles regularly or loose their edge.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are struggling to keep launch teams in Florida sharp
with computer simulations, while they search for alternate
payloads. One developing plan is to have the shuttles send up
logistics materials and supplies ahead of schedule. Another is to
add a science mission unconnected to the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   In the more distant future, Rothenberg noted, demands on the
shuttles will actually soar since Russia has informed NASA it
cannot afford to launch unpiloted resupply ships to the outpost at
the rate it expected.
</P>
<P>
   While 33 Russian supply ships were originally promised to haul
up cargo and propellant, the number has now dwindled to 15 or 17,
and the shuttles will have to take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's put a change into the program,'' Rothenberg said.

<P>
   DENVER _ At the headquarters of the Colorado Republican Party on
Monday, the television set was not working, so some staffers
listened to President Clinton's grand jury deposition on the radio.
Others got a different kind of earful over the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just about all the complaints were `I can't believe you
Republicans are doing this,''' said Michael Fortinberry, the
party's political director, who moved to another downtown office in
midmorning to watch the video. ``If that is the perception, it
hurts the party.''
</P>
<P>
   While several callers wanted Congress to impeach the president,
others blamed party politics for the airing of the video. ``There
seemed to be a very specific belief that the Republicans were doing
this today,'' Fortinberry said.
</P>
<P>
   At the downtown office, Donald Bain, a former state party
chairman, agreed, predicting that any backlash ``would be over the
release, not over the content.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think you are going to see a backlash from the
testimony itself,'' Bain continued, after rolling his eyes over one
prosecutor's question about oral sex. Looking to the November
elections, he cautioned: ``The big risk for Republicans is that
they assume that all the votes are in the bank and that they can
rest on the status quo. That's a very dangerous attitude for
Republicans to take.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the Denver area Monday morning, Republican candidates and
campaign managers said they were either avoiding the broadcast or
keeping one eye on the television while working the telephones.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been trying to avoid it,'' said Bob Greenlee, a
Republican who is running for Congress in the 2nd District, a
centrist suburban area that includes Boulder. On Friday, Greenlee
urged local television networks to refuse to air the video, saying
``Airing the tape is a voyeuristic exercise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is real potential for some kind of a backlash,''
Greenlee said of the broadcast. Although he charged that Clinton
``lied to all of us,'' he added, ``My sense is that the public is
damn sick of this whole thing and would like it to end.''

FOURTH DAY OF PRICE GAINS FOR BONDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT HURTADO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Treasury yields declined Monday for the fourth
consecutive session, with no significant economic reports to move
the market.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the scarcity of economic data, many investors
were observing Rosh Hashana, the Jewish New Year, and trading
volume was down about 11 percent from normal, according to Govpx, a
bond-pricing service.
</P>
<P>
   By late in the day the 30-year bond was up 12/32 to a price of
105 27/32. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction,
slipped to 5.12 percent, from 5.14 percent on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Widening concern among investors that Japan's recession will
worsen and cut into corporate profits, and questions about whether
Japan will be able to overhaul its battered banking system anytime
soon, once again increased the attractiveness of Treasuries as an
alternative investment to stocks, lowering long-bond yields to
levels not seen for 30 years.
</P>
<P>
   The telecast of President Clinton's grand jury testimony in the
Monica Lewinsky matter appeared to have little impact on the
market.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Gamba, vice president and manager of taxable fixed-income
securities for SG Cowen Private Client Group, said the market had
been anticipating the videotape since last week and had already
priced in all the negatives, so when the tapes were released,
``There was a relief rally in stocks, and that helped take some of
the flight to safety out of bonds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have the second-quarter GDP report this week, which is
considered important, and a two-year-note auction on Wednesday,''
Gamba said. ``Given the current condition of the global economies
and financial markets elsewhere in the world, I think the two-year
will have no problem getting done.''
</P>
<P>
   In when-issued trading, dealers were offering the new two-year
issue at a price to yield 4.61 percent.

 &HT;    VIDEOTAPE OFFERS VIEWERS RARE GLIMPSE AT UNSCRIPTED CLINTON
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Millions of Americans on Monday saw President
Clinton portray himself as a victim of his right-wing political
foes as he fell back on legalisms to dodge perjury charges in his
videotaped grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's historic and unscripted ordeal before an invisible
tag team of federal prosecutors left viewers with no apparent
``smoking gun'' ensuring that his scandalous affair with Monica
Lewinsky would lead Congress to remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   During four hours and three minutes of mostly polite but often
blunt questioning, recorded by a single camera, the TV audience
witnessed a Clinton they had rarely seen before: by turns
combative, garrulous, philosophical and contrite.
</P>
<P>
   As the Aug. 17 encounter progressed, Clinton proved unwilling to
answer many specific questions about his sexual encounters with the
former young White House aide. He repeatedly refused to go beyond a
prepared single-page, thrice-folded statement that he pulled from
his jacket pocket seven minutes into the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   At the end, Clinton posed one wry question to the prosecutors
which they left hanging: Whether the need to accommodate an absent
grand juror was ``the only reason ... you have to videotape?''
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the scene in the White House Map Room was a far cry
from the familiar highly scripted, professionally lit circumstances
in which modern presidents normally offer televised ``sound bites''
to huge viewing audiences.
</P>
<P>
   The sole props that relieved the stark backdrop were a small
bowl of flowers over Clinton's right shoulder. Clinton paused on
occasion to sip from a glass of ice water or to drink from cans of
ginger ale or Diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   At one juncture, offering the grand jurors a Rashomon-like
aside, Clinton suggested that persons involved in a sexual
relationship can see the same set of facts from entirely different
vantage points.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the president went on, sexuality may be the ``most
mysterious area of human life,'' citing as an example Anita Hill's
sexual harassment charges against Clarence Thomas during the
Supreme Court nominee's 1991 hearings before the Senate Judiciary
Committee.
</P>
<P>
   But far more often, in responding to a barrage of questions that
focused largely on whether he might have committed perjury when he
described the affair under oath in the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit, Clinton exhibited a steely edge punctuated by
flashes of irritation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have testified about this three times. Now, I will do it the
fourth time. I am not going to answer your trick questions,'' the
president snapped at one point to Sol Wisenberg, a deputy
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes after he began, Clinton wagged his index finger
in a move that evoked his unequivocal Jan. 26 denial that he ever
had ``sexual relations with that woman, Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, however, Clinton went on the attack, charging that
Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel, was in league with the
conservative forces who the Jones suit against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious and I think by your questions you have betrayed
that the Jones lawyers' strategy in this case had nothing to do
with uncovering or proving sexual harassment,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no secret to anybody that I hoped that this relationship
(with Lewinsky) would never become public,'' Clinton later added.
</P>
<P>
   He suggested that while he had prepared well for the Jones case,
he had not expected that Linda Tripp, a Lewinsky confidante, would
provide extensive details of the affair to his interrogators the
evening before his deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most dramatic moment of the videotaped afternoon
session came when Robert Bittman, another Starr aide, asked a
series of questions, each tied to the same basic theme, that began,
``If Monica Lewinsky says that while you were in the Oval Office
area you touched her breast, would she be lying?
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not my recollection,'' Clinton replied, after being
denied a chance to say ``something general about this.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My recollection,'' Clinton added, ``is that I did not have
sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky, and I am staying on my former
(written) statement about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared startled when Bittman asked: ``If Monica
Lewinsky says that you used a cigar as a sexual aid with her in the
Oval Office area, would she be lying? Yes, no, or won't answer?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I will revert to my former statement,'' the president said
again, this time with a clenched jaw.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappy prosecutors complained about Clinton's long, often
convoluted answers and pleaded with him in vain to extend the
session beyond the agreed four hours. At one point, the president
said he would think about an extension; another time, he said he
would give Starr's team an extra 30 seconds if they in turn would
allow him make a statement.

KEY RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT POSITIONS REMAIN VACANT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By MICHAEL WINES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Russia's leaders offered more assurances Monday that
the country's fiscal crisis could be tamed without provoking high
inflation or social unrest. But with key positions in the
government still unfilled, few people seemed to accord the promises
much weight.
</P>
<P>
   Neither President Boris Yeltsin nor his prime minister, Yevgeny
Primakov, have settled on a choice for finance minister, perhaps
the most important post in the new government next to Primakov's.
The finance minister will carry out many of the government's crisis
measures.
</P>
<P>
   The man who currently holds the post, Mikhail Zadornov, pledged
Monday that foreign investors would receive equal treatment with
Russians in negotiations to reschedule the payment of $40 million
in government bonds that was frozen when the crisis broke last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov also said the government would pay at least 40 billion
rubles in back wages to government workers by the end of the year
without having to print additional money that might spur a new
round of inflation.
</P>
<P>
   But both statements more or less contradict policies already
announced by the central bank and one of the new deputy prime
ministers, Aleksandr Shokhin.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin has supported printing money to quickly pay off wage
arrears, and the central bank has already said that it will
purchase government bonds held by Russian banks as a means of
bailing them out of their financial difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Zadornov is one of the few market advocates remaining from the
government that Yeltsin dismissed last month. He refused to say
Monday whether his own job was in jeopardy, but Yeltsin is known to
be looking at other candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Shokhin said Monday that the government might issue a schedule
on Thursday to pay wage arrears and improve tax collection. He also
suggested that the government would soon unveil new financial
instruments aimed at attracting investors with hard currency and
perhaps guaranteed by a consortium of Western banks rather than the
Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   What little remains of Russia's financial markets took no solace
from Zadornov's or Shokhin's remarks. Trading in the ruble was
suspended at midafternoon Monday as the exchange rate reached as
much as 19 rubles to the dollar, three times the level of barely a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   In St. Petersburg, about 1,000 pro-Communist demonstrators, some
carrying portraits of Stalin, marched through the center of the
city to protest price increases. And in France, the leader of
Russia's Communist Party, Gennadi Zyuganov, said Primakov's
government might represent Russia's last chance to avert a military
dictatorship or civil war.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``It is important for us to support Primakov's government,'' he
said. ``The Yeltsin era is finished. It is very important for us
not to end up with a civil war.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the men seen as most responsible for Primakov's ascension
to prime minister, the reformist politician Grigory Yavlinsky, was
in a Moscow hospital Monday being treated for what doctors
described as heart failure.
</P>
<P>
   Yavlinsky, 46, leads the Yabloko political bloc, which controls
10 percent of the lower house of Parliament. Although a critic of
the Communists and conservatives with whom Primakov is most closely
associated, he urged legislators to support Primakov's appointment
as prime minister as a means of unifying the country behind a
single leader.
</P>
<P>
   The precise nature of Yavlinsky's ailment was not clear. Doctors
were quoted as saying he was already able to work and might be
released by Tuesday or Wednesday. Yavlinsky entered the hospital
over the weekend, they said.

 &HT;    With CLINTON-0922.
 &HT;    By BOB DEANS 
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton journeyed to the high church of
global diplomacy on Monday, imploring world leaders at the United
Nations to help combat a new generation of terrorist threats, even
as millions of Americans watched a videotape of the nation's
embattled leader staggering through torturous testimony about his
ill-fated affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic moment that seemed to crystallize the conflicting
forces tugging at his presidency, and the incongruent roles he's
become obliged to assume, Clinton drew a standing ovation as he
entered the U.N.'s cavernous General Assembly Hall to take on the
sobering scourges of car bombs and skyjackings, against the
strikingly discordant background music of his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president did not watch the
testimony, which was televised by several national networks,
because he was busy honing and delivering his speech to the General
Assembly and conducting one-on-one diplomacy with a handful of his
counterparts behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials made no secret, however, of their
aggravation over the timing of the aired testimony, which largely
occluded coverage of Clinton's annual address to the U.N. General
Assembly and his request, announced later, for $1.8 billion to
buttress U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House couldn't feel anything but awful about the day
that we have gone through as a nation,'' said Clinton spokesman
Michael McCurry. ``There is a great deal of salacious material; a
great deal of material that is designed, it seems, to do nothing
but . . . exasperate the president and those around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in solemn, almost reverent tones in the expansive U.N.
setting for two generations of debate over issues centered on war
and peace, Clinton told more than 1,100 diplomats and heads of
state that ``Terror has become the world's problem.'' He exhorted
delegates from the 184 other U.N. member-nations to join the United
States in what has been one of the most difficult foreign policy
tasks of his presidency: winning the support of the international
community in trying to isolate, counter and punish terrorist groups
and the regimes that support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a grave misconception to see terrorism as only, or even
mostly, an American problem,'' said Clinton. ``It is a clear and
present danger to tolerant and open societies, and innocent people
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the urgency of the issue, Clinton plans to ask
Congress later this week to approve $1.8 billion in emergency
spending. The money would be used to help rebuild the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that were destroyed last month by
deadly terrorist bombings that killed 12 Americans, shore up
protections for other U.S. diplomatic missions around the world,
and beef up U.S. intelligence and law enforcement capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is overwhelmingly in the national interest,'' said
National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, who said he's
had extensive discussions on the issue with the Republican
leadership in both houses of Congress. ``That's not to say there's
agreement on all aspects of this,'' Berger said, conceding that the
White House still must win congressional approval for the funding.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever long-term impact Clinton's initiatives have on the
global terrorist threat, the drama of Monday's U.N. appearance
centered on his personal troubles over the Lewinsky scandal that
threatens his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton was heartened by the spontaneous, and rare,
ovation he received when he stepped onto the historic sea-green
stage to address the grand global forum, and felt the immensity of
the delegates' response.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton strode onto the platform to take his seat in the
formal high-backed ivory-colored chair to the right of the grey
marble podium, an uncharacteristic murmur swept the chamber. Then,
a wave of applause broke the tension and grew until, to Clinton's
left, a small group of delegates rose, quickly followed by more.
Within a few moments, delegates from Angola to Zimbabwe were on
their feet, as Clinton, still seated, acknowledged the
much-welcomed show of support with a nod and a quick wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen that before,'' Berger said of the ovation
Clinton received. ``I think it was an expression by the
international community of the stature and regard in which he is
held, their affection for him personally and their very strong
sense that American leadership, strong American leadership,
continues to be essential.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 21-minute speech, Clinton focused almost exclusively on
terrorism, taking pains to stress that the United States was not
trying to drive a wedge between the Western and Islamic world,
where much of the support for terrorism has been concentrated, and
that he did not see the war on terrorism as a crusade against the
world's 1.1 billion Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans respect and honor Islam,'' said Clinton. ``We will
remain on a course of friendship and respect for the Muslim
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he stressed, the United States rejects the use of any
religion as a justification for terrorism -- ``False prophets may
use and abuse any religion to justify whatever political objectives
they have, even cold-blooded murder,'' he said -- and does not
accept indiscriminate killing as a way of addressing economic and
political ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depravation cannot justify destruction, nor can inequity ever
atone for murder,'' Clinton said. ``The killing of innocents is not
a social program.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Sticking carefully to his scripted remarks, Clinton did not
reply to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's unusually frank
critique of the international community's failure to end months of
bloodshed in the Serb province of Kosovo. There, minority Serbs
have killed hundreds of ethnic Albanians and run thousands more
from their homes through a bloody campaign of terror hauntingly
reminiscent of the violence that killed some 200,000 non-Serbs in
Bosnia before a U.S.-led NATO mission ended the conflict three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo, the international community seems to be watching
impotently,'' Annan said in remarks to open this year's three-month
General Assembly session, shortly before Clinton's address. Annan
compared the situation to years of international failings in
Bosnia, ``something we swore must never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan also took a shot at the refusal by the U.S. Congress to
fund Clinton's request for money to pay some $1 billion in arrears
the United States owes the United Nations, saying the organization
is operating in ``a financial straitjacket,'' with its ability to
function, and even to reform itself along lines favored by Congress
and the White House, sharply impeded by its cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stringency is one thing, and a starvation diet is quite
another,'' Annan said, without mentioning the United States by
name. ''There can be no substitute for full and timely payment of
what is due.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Story can end here. Optional add begins.)
</P>
<P>
   In another stirring moment, South Africa's aging anti-apartheid
crusader and outgoing president Nelson Mandela delivered an
impassioned farewell to the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Mandela called on the body to undertake an aggressive campaign
to eliminate nuclear weapons and summed up in disarmingly simple
eloquence an activist career that sustained him through 27 years as
a political prisoner and led him to guide his nation out from the
shadow of its racist past to its first full and free national
elections four years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have reached the point in the long walk where the
opportunity is granted, as it should be to all men and women, to
return to some rest and tranquility in the village of my birth,''
said Mandela, who goes to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to receive a
gold medal from Clinton for his life-long fight against oppression.
``It was right that we dreamed and that we toiled to give life to a
workable dream.''

ASLEEP IN THE COCKPIT? AUTOMATION'S NIGHTMARE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MATTHEW L. WALD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ New passenger jets are so automated that two pilots
do the work that used to be performed by three, yet they have
lighter workloads. The newer planes also make longer trips, across
more time zones. While technology has increased airline safety in
many ways, it can also make for sleepy pilots. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``Although today's automated flight systems prevent the sleeping
pilot from losing control, the less extreme effects of fatigue can
seriously jeopardize flight safety,'' according to a paper
presented at a Flight Safety Foundation workshop in Paris last year
by two sleep specialists at NASA, David F. Dinges and R. Curtis
Graeber. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The National Transportation Safety Board lists just one aircraft
accident involving a large plane as having been caused primarily by
a sleepy crew, the crash of a McDonnell Douglas DC-8 freighter
belonging to American International Airways at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba, on Aug. 18, 1993. The plane came in on a clear day, on the
proper path, but its speed fell too low to keep it aloft and it
struck a quarter-mile short of the runway, seriously injuring all
three crew members. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The captain had slept 15 hours out of the previous 65, and just
5 hours in the last 28{, though the report does not say why. On the
final approach, he could not spot the strobe light marking the
runway even when it was pointed out four times by the first officer
and the flight engineer, according to the transcript of the cockpit
voice recorder.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two minutes of the flight, the flight engineer said
seven times that the plane was flying too slowly, but the captain
did not pay attention. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this incident, a joint experiment by NASA and the Federal
Aviation Administration published in 1994 found lapses by sleepy
pilots on accident-free flights. The study was published by the
NASA Ames Fatigue Countermeasures Program, which calls itself the Z
team, with Drs. Graeber and Dinges among the authors.
</P>
<P>
   Two NASA researchers accompanied seven three-person Boeing 747
crews on trans-Pacific flights. Four of the crews were allowed to
take ``controlled naps,'' each member taking a turn at a 40-minute
rest period, followed by a 20-minute recovery period. Three crews
were not given scheduled rest. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On average, pilots or flight engineers fell asleep in less than
six minutes, which is generally a sign of ``moderately
sleep-deprived individuals,'' the report said. Of the nine members
of the three crews who were not given permission to sleep, four
fell asleep anyway during the test, one of them twice. They slept
for periods of several minutes to more than 10 minutes, the
researchers said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One way to read this result, said Dr. David Neri, head of the Z
team, is that on some challenging routes, naps will either be
scheduled and controlled or unscheduled and uncontrolled. They will
occur in either case.
</P>
<P>
   But those who were allowed to nap, performed better. In the
test, the NASA researchers counted delayed reactions to stimuli.
The 21 who had been allowed to nap had a total of 124 such lapses,
but those who had not had scheduled naps had twice as many. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The authors pointed out that they had not addressed how a study
in a three-person cockpit would translate to a two-person cockpit,
which is the norm today in airliners. Even the newest Boeing 747s
have two-person cockpits, even though with a range of 8,380
nautical miles, pilots can easily spend the maximum allowable daily
time at the controls _ eight hours _ on a single flight. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Since publication of the study, the FAA has tried to draft new
rules on how many hours a pilot can work and how many he or she can
fly. Pilots are now limited to 16 hours of scheduled work in a day
and airlines can schedule a shift to start nine hours after one
ends. A loophole also allows pilots to fly empty planes without the
hours counting against the limits of 30 hours a week or 100 a
month.
</P>
<P>
   The FAA has proposed a 14-hour daily work limit for pilots, 10
hours between shifts and the end of the empty-plane loophole. But
the agency has made little progress, because pilots' unions do not
want rules that will cut their members' incomes, and airlines do
not want rules that will require them to hire more crews.
</P>
<P>
   On some long flights, they already use relief crews _ pilots who
take passenger seats and sleep through the first half of a flight,
then assume control for the second half. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sleep researchers say that federal limits on how many hours a
day or month a pilot can work are important, but that part of the
problem is simple jet lag _ pilots' not being able to fall asleep
during an assigned rest period, and having trouble staying awake
when they are supposed to. The FAA does not allow napping, even
though regulators have no doubt it occurs. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign airlines allow naps in two-worker cockpits. At
Swissair, Erwin Schaerer, a spokesman, said napping had been
routine for years, but had to be planned before the flight, and had
to conclude 30 minutes before the plane began its descent. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   And Boeing has a safety feature in newer planes: an alarm that
puts warning words on a computer screen, then finally beeps loudly,
if no one in the cockpit touches any button for a specified
interval. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ President Clinton journeyed to the high church of
global diplomacy on Monday, imploring world leaders at the United
Nations to help combat a new generation of terrorist threats, even
as millions of Americans watched a videotape of the nation's
embattled leader staggering through torturous testimony about his
ill-fated affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In a dramatic moment that seemed to crystallize the conflicting
forces tugging at his presidency, and the incongruent roles he's
become obliged to assume, Clinton drew a standing ovation as he
entered the U.N.'s cavernous General Assembly Hall to take on the
sobering scourges of car bombs and skyjackings, against the
strikingly discordant background music of his grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said the president did not watch the
testimony, which was televised by several national networks,
because he was busy honing and delivering his speech to the General
Assembly and conducting one-on-one diplomacy with a handful of his
counterparts behind the scenes.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials made no secret, however, of their
aggravation over the timing of the aired testimony, which largely
occluded coverage of Clinton's annual address to the U.N. General
Assembly and his request, announced later, for $1.8 billion to
buttress U.S. counter-terrorism efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ''The White House couldn't feel anything but awful about the day
that we have gone through as a nation,'' said Clinton spokesman
Michael McCurry. ``There is a great deal of salacious material; a
great deal of material that is designed, it seems, to do nothing
but . . . exasperate the president and those around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking in solemn, almost reverent tones in the expansive U.N.
setting for two generations of debate over issues centered on war
and peace, Clinton told more than 1,100 diplomats and heads of
state that ``Terror has become the world's problem.'' He exhorted
delegates from the 184 other U.N. member-nations to join the United
States in what has been one of the most difficult foreign policy
tasks of his presidency: winning the support of the international
community in trying to isolate, counter and punish terrorist groups
and the regimes that support them.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a grave misconception to see terrorism as only, or even
mostly, an American problem,'' said Clinton. ``It is a clear and
present danger to tolerant and open societies, and innocent people
everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Underscoring the urgency of the issue, Clinton plans to ask
Congress later this week to approve $1.8 billion in emergency
spending. The money would be used to help rebuild the American
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania that were destroyed last month by
deadly terrorist bombings that killed 12 Americans, shore up
protections for other U.S. diplomatic missions around the world,
and beef up U.S. intelligence and law enforcement capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   ''This is overwhelmingly in the national interest,'' said
National Security Adviser Samuel ``Sandy'' Berger, who said he's
had extensive discussions on the issue with the Republican
leadership in both houses of Congress. ``That's not to say there's
agreement on all aspects of this,'' Berger said, conceding that the
White House still must win congressional approval for the funding.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever long-term impact Clinton's initiatives have on the
global terrorist threat, the drama of Monday's U.N. appearance
centered on his personal troubles over the Lewinsky scandal that
threatens his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Aides said Clinton was heartened by the spontaneous, and rare,
ovation he received when he stepped onto the historic sea-green
stage to address the grand global forum, and felt the immensity of
the delegates' response.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Optional trim begins.)
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton strode onto the platform to take his seat in the
formal high-backed ivory-colored chair to the right of the grey
marble podium, an uncharacteristic murmur swept the chamber. Then,
a wave of applause broke the tension and grew until, to Clinton's
left, a small group of delegates rose, quickly followed by more.
Within a few moments, delegates from Angola to Zimbabwe were on
their feet, as Clinton, still seated, acknowledged the
much-welcomed show of support with a nod and a quick wave.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've not seen that before,'' Berger said of the ovation
Clinton received. ``I think it was an expression by the
international community of the stature and regard in which he is
held, their affection for him personally and their very strong
sense that American leadership, strong American leadership,
continues to be essential.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 21-minute speech, Clinton focused almost exclusively on
terrorism, taking pains to stress that the United States was not
trying to drive a wedge between the Western and Islamic world,
where much of the support for terrorism has been concentrated, and
that he did not see the war on terrorism as a crusade against the
world's 1.1 billion Muslims.
</P>
<P>
   ``Americans respect and honor Islam,'' said Clinton. ``We will
remain on a course of friendship and respect for the Muslim
world.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he stressed, the United States rejects the use of any
religion as a justification for terrorism -- ``False prophets may
use and abuse any religion to justify whatever political objectives
they have, even cold-blooded murder,'' he said -- and does not
accept indiscriminate killing as a way of addressing economic and
political ills.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depravation cannot justify destruction, nor can inequity ever
atone for murder,'' Clinton said. ``The killing of innocents is not
a social program.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Sticking carefully to his scripted remarks, Clinton did not
reply to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan's unusually frank
critique of the international community's failure to end months of
bloodshed in the Serb province of Kosovo. There, minority Serbs
have killed hundreds of ethnic Albanians and run thousands more
from their homes through a bloody campaign of terror hauntingly
reminiscent of the violence that killed some 200,000 non-Serbs in
Bosnia before a U.S.-led NATO mission ended the conflict three
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Kosovo, the international community seems to be watching
impotently,'' Annan said in remarks to open this year's three-month
General Assembly session, shortly before Clinton's address. Annan
compared the situation to years of international failings in
Bosnia, ``something we swore must never happen again.''
</P>
<P>
   Annan also took a shot at the refusal by the U.S. Congress to
fund Clinton's request for money to pay some $1 billion in arrears
the United States owes the United Nations, saying the organization
is operating in ``a financial straitjacket,'' with its ability to

and the White House, sharply impeded by its cash crunch.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stringency is one thing, and a starvation diet is quite
another,'' Annan said, without mentioning the United States by

what is due.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In another stirring moment, South Africa's aging anti-apartheid
crusader and outgoing president Nelson Mandela delivered an
impassioned farewell to the General Assembly.

opportunity is granted, as it should be to all men and women, to
return to some rest and tranquility in the village of my birth,''
said Mandela, who goes to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to receive a
gold medal from Clinton for his life-long fight against oppression.
``It was right that we dreamed and that we toiled to give life to a
workable dream.''

   URBANA, ILL. _ Like most beginnings, it was not predictable.
Herman C. Krannert, a wealthy cardboard box maker, suddenly agreed
to endow a performing arts center at the University of Illinois,
far from either bright lights or big city.
</P>
<P>
   Architect Max Abramovitz, who worked on Avery Fisher Hall at
Lincoln Center, was asked to do the design. The eventual cost of
what he called his ``acropolis on the prairie'' was $21 million.
</P>
<P>
   As it approached completion, a young Michigan woman who once
wanted to sing for Motown stopped by for a jazz competition, fell
in love with a student musician and decided to stay. It was 1969.
The building and the singer were elegant and young.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, the Krannert Center for the Performing Arts,
which has since flourished as a performance hall and as a showcase
for young artists and new works, will celebrate the opening of its
30th season with fireworks and choruses. The jazz singer, Dee Dee
Bridgewater, still elegant and something more, will be onstage for
a sold-out performance. (This year she won a Grammy for her album
``Dear Ella,'' a tribute to Ella Fitzgerald.)
</P>
<P>
   In a telephone interview from France, where she lives outside
Paris, Ms. Bridgewater said her professional career had begun
shortly after the first time she saw Cecil Bridgewater, then a
student at the University of Illinois.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told my mother, `Do you see that man with that big Afro and
that trumpet getting out of that Volkswagen? I'm going to marry
him.' Six months later, we got married.''
</P>
<P>
   At the time, she was Denise Eileen Garrett, born in Memphis in
1950 and raised in Flint, Mich., listening to jazz and Top 40
songs, hoping to record for Motown. When the two other young women
in her group, the Iridescents, ``became more interested in boys,''
she turned to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was easier, working with trios my dad would put together,
to do standards,'' she said. ``I sang on weekends, with my father
as my chaperone. I was under age, so I had to sit in the kitchen
between my sets.'' Later, as a student at Michigan State, she
earned money singing with a jazz quintet.
</P>
<P>
   After the competition in Illinois, John Garvey, director of the
University of Illinois Jazz Band, asked the young singer if she
wanted to switch universities and go to the Soviet Union on tour
with his band. With Bridgewater in mind, she said yes.
</P>
<P>
   She sang again at Krannert, but for the most part she performed
with a jazz group, the Bridgewater Brothers, at a Chinese
restaurant near campus and at local clubs. ``It became easier than
going to school, so I dropped out,'' she recalled. In 1970 she and
her husband moved to New York, where their daughter, Tulani, was
born and where Ms. Bridgewater sang at the Village Vanguard with
the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything I know about music today, I learned in that band,''
she said. ``It taught me how important it is to sing the melody.
Without knowing the melody, you can never be a good improviser, and
you show a disrespect to the author and composer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I also learned how to breathe and project my voice over 15
horns and a rhythm section,'' she said. Jones taught her the
importance of arrangements. ``Otherwise, it leaves things to
chance,'' she said. ``When you don't have a beginning or an ending,
too often you have a cliche ending.'' Ms. Bridgewater's career took
off, but her marriage foundered. In 1974 she quit jazz and took a
role as Glinda the Good Witch in ``The Wiz,'' which opened
off-Broadway. At the time, she was romantically involved with the
show's director, Gilbert Moses. He was dismissed before the show
opened on Broadway, and her role was cut in half.
</P>
<P>
   ``My revenge _ my reward _ is that I got the Tony,'' she said.
But even that experience turned sour. When the show's teen-age star
was not nominated, Ms. Bridgewater said, ``there were all these
rumors that I slept around to get the nomination.'' It was the
beginning of an education in the school of hard knocks that
continued after she moved to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   In 1983, after marriage to Moses and her second child, China
Moses, Ms. Bridgewater left California for a national tour with
``Sophisticated Ladies.'' Two magical things happened. She met Ella
Fitzgerald in Tokyo and talked with her backstage. Then the show
went to France, where Ms. Bridgewater was shocked to find she was a
star. She moved to Paris in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the best decision I've made,'' she said. ``I feel like
France has been my lucky charm.''
</P>
<P>
   She was married for a third time, to Jean-Marie Durand, who was
working as a bartender at a jazz club in Paris when she met him.
``I saw him coming down the stairs while I was rehearsing,'' she
said. ``I stopped singing and caught my breath. He had on tight
jeans and a ponytail. Three days later, I got up the nerve to talk
to him. He was younger than me, I could tell. He took me home Oct.
14, 1986, and we have literally been together since that night.
Recently, we celebrated our seventh anniversary.'' Their son,
Gabriel, was born in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``I feel more secure,'' she said. ``I've seen people
who were starting out with me who have gone on to become
multimillionaires, and I don't have any remorse and jealousy. I'm
happy with my life. I grew up here. I became a woman here. I lost
my fear of performing and being criticized.''
</P>
<P>
   For ``Dear Ella,'' Ms. Bridgewater asked her former husband,
Cecil Bridgewater, to write arrangements for three Fitzgerald
signature pieces, including ``How High the Moon.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to devise a way of doing it that would be fresh,'' he
said, ``that would be a challenge to her and would make musical
sense.''
</P>
<P>
   In her performance on Wednesday at Krannert, she will bring that
musical sense back to the place where she began. ``I love a
stage,'' she said. ``Give me a stage. Give me a spotlight. I turn
on.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The stage in question has weathered the years well. The Krannert
Center is host to more than 300 performances a year. Audiences from
four theaters mingle in a single lobby the size of nine tennis
courts. The vast parquet floor, which consumed the entire U.S.
import allotment of teak in 1968, has withstood millions of high
heels. And the acoustics in the center's Foellinger Great Hall,
once a favorite recording site for the Chicago Symphony, are by all
accounts exquisite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing that made Krannert Center so compelling in the first
place was not just the monumentality of the facility,'' said its
director, Michael Ross, who came in 1997 from the Kathryn Bache
Miller Theater at Columbia University. ``It was the notion that
great art could be combined with great education.''
</P>
<P>
   Some big successes, like Ms. Bridgewater, don't graduate, and
some graduates don't succeed. But there is always hope. ``This is
not just a home for road shows,'' said Kathleen F. Conlin, who
oversees Ross and the Krannert staff as dean of the College of Fine
and Applied Arts at the university. ``This is our life.''

<P>
   ATLANTA _ It might have been from emotion or it might have been
the color control on the itty-bitty television, but President
Clinton's face shone a bright pink through much of his videotaped
grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The six Emory University students who gathered around the
13-inch screen Monday morning in Brian Oubre's campus apartment
said the president looked angry, defensive and dishonest, and if he
was not ashamed of himself, he should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a colossal ego, to drag your country through
this,'' said Oubre, a 21-year-old senior from Baton Rouge, La., as
Clinton either evaded questions about specifically what sex acts he
engaged in with Monica Lewinsky, or answered with what he and
others in the country now know are untruths.
</P>
<P>
   The students, friends and classmates, had already made up their
minds about Clinton before the airing of the videotape, and saw it
as just more embarrassment heaped on the man, his office, and the
nation he leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not worth what we're paying for this fiasco,'' said
Oubre, a history and economics major.
</P>
<P>
   The six students, a mix of Democrats and Republicans and one
Independent _ Oubre _ passed around a box of Kix breakfast cereal
and alternately hissed, laughed or rolled their at the eyes at
Clinton's definitions of what is, or is not, sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he's lying, or he's an idiot,'' said Chuck Divine, a
21-year-old biology and political science major who is also
president of Emory's Student Government Association. He is a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But though the students were dismayed at Clinton's answers, some
of them were also dismayed at the questions _ questions that seemed
to go far beyond simple fact-finding, that seemed to solicit more
detail than was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about JFK and FDR?'' said Suzann Arnold, a 21-year-old
sociology major from Marion, N.C. ``We didn't ask them these
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the only one of the six who, when asked if they thought
Clinton should resign, was not certain that he should. She is a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   After about two hours of seeing Clinton answer or not answer
questions they thought they already knew the answers to, the
students started to slip away, to class, to naps, or just to get
away from the television.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seemed to be that it was boring, but a little
painful.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, said Miss Stephens, other generations will be so
disgusted by what happened to this president, by both the scandal
and the salacious way his political adversaries insisted it be
presented to the American people, that they will be spared a
repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' she said.

<P>
   Much like television viewers, network executives were unsure
what to expect when the video cassettes of President Clinton's
grand jury appearance were popped into tape machines in Washington
Monday morning, and equally unsure how much of the sometimes
salacious testimony they wanted the country to see.
</P>
<P>
   But very quickly the three major broadcast networks changed
plans and decided to join the all-news cable networks in televising
all four hours of testimony. NBC News briefly cut away from it
twice, because of the explicit discussion of sexual activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just so highly unusual,'' Andrew Heyward, the president
of CBS News, said Monday. ``We're in unexplored territory for
everybody, but soon after it started we made the decision to stick
with it. We wanted to get some sense of flavor of material, if it
was substantive as opposed just legalistic, and how graphic it was.
Pretty early on it appeared there would be substance there.''
</P>
<P>
   David Westin, president of ABC News, said the network's original
plan had been to broadcast the first videotape, of 11 minutes,
which included the president's opening statement, and then use
excerpts as the content warranted.
</P>
<P>
   ``But as we got into it we found it very compelling, and we
found it very substantive,'' he said. ``My concern was that it
might be repetitious or a lot of lawyers talking. But there was
certainly news there.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC, CBS, NBC and the four cable networks _ CNN, C-Span, Fox
News Channel and MSNBC _ all repeatedly put labels across the
bottom of the screen warning of sexual content or strong language.
Their anchors made such warnings orally, as well, during brief
breaks in the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   While the videotape played on screen, reporters and producers
were reading through the typed transcript of it as fast as they
could, trying to spot testimony that might be offensive so that it
could be excised.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got about half an hour ahead'' of the videotape, Bill
Wheatley, vice president of NBC News, said. ``So on the first
excision, we had time to talk it through calmly. The second we made
kind of on the fly.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC first cut away at 11:45 a.m., when testimony turned to
details of the president's sexual interactions with Monica
Lewinsky. Tom Brokaw spent the next seven minutes interviewing some
of the network's expert consultants.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believed that despite the warnings we'd been carrying about
content, some viewers might still be offended about the most
graphic testimony,'' Wheatley said. ``And there was some concern
there might be unsupervised children watching, so at some points we
drew the line.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC also cut away at 12:04 p.m. for about two and a half
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're in uncharted territory, and there is no such
thing as a right call or a wrong call,'' Heyward said.
</P>
<P>
   Heyward said he made CBS's decisions in consultation with
colleagues including the anchor, Dan Rather. ``At one point I went
out on the set to talk with Dan about some of the seamier sections
coming up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Initially, only ABC delayed the tape's roll (by five seconds)
for possible editing, but by mid-morning the other two networks
were also using tape-delay, but of slightly different duration. For
viewers, this led to the weird sensation of being able to click
from NBC to ABC to CBS and hearing Clinton say the same words three
times in a row.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   All the networks also put the testimony on their Web sites, and
at breaks in the testimony, the television anchormen directed
viewers to their respective web sites for more information. The
entire speech can be downloaded from some sites.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet was also widely used by people at work, who have
computers but not television sets in their offices.
</P>
<P>
   At some points, it was difficult to get onto certain sites, or
get the video, because of high traffic. Some Web sites, like CNN,
engaged high-tech ``backbone enhancing'' companies like Real
Networks and Broadcast.com to make sure they could handle the
traffic.

 &HT;    IN NATION'S CAPITAL AND ACROSS AMERICA, CLINTON'S TESTIMONY WAS
HARDLY RIVETING
 &HT;    By EUNICE MOSCOSO and NICHOLE MONROE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's video testimony reverberated
through congressional offices Monday morning, but the rest of the
nation's capital was hardly moved by the historic event.
</P>
<P>
   And even on Capitol Hill, few congressional aides were riveted
to television sets that aired Clinton's grilling by attorneys for
independent counsel Kenneth Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key word here is working,'' said Dave Schnittger (CQ),
spokesman for Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, chairman of the House
Republican Conference. ``It's pretty much business as usual.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind almost every open door in House and Senate office
buildings, a small television played the testimony. But staffers
continued to stuff envelopes, answer phones and prepare for this
week's legislative debates.
</P>
<P>
   That business-as-usual attitude seemed pervasive elsewhere in
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   In the student union at the University of Texas in Austin, about
25 curious students watched silently as the president dissected the
nature of his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``The tape shouldn't have been released. It's part of a
political with hunt,'' said Jeff Young, a biology senior. ``What he
did wasn't right, but he doesn't deserve public humiliation like
this.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Dayton Mall in Ohio, TV saleswoman Cathy Hockwalt has
seen large crowds drawn to televisions like moths to light, as when
the O.J. Simpson verdict was read or during coverage of Princess
Diana's death. But Clinton's video testimony didn't attract the
same level of interest, said Hockwalt, who added that several
shoppers said they were tired of watching it.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few dozen students quietly watched the testimony in the
lobby of nearby Wright State University's Allyn Hall.
</P>
<P>
   At the Roberd's appliance store in the Dayton suburb of West
Carrollton, where about 100 TVs were playing, only a handful of
shoppers paused to catch Clinton's testimony, said salesman Mark
Florkey. ``They mostly just watched, not saying much of anything.''
</P>
<P>
   At Poppa Rollo's Pizza in Waco, Texas, co-owner Mary Duty
worried that the televised testimony would be bad for business.
``This is not like the O.J. Simpson trial,'' said Duty, who once
worked for a congressman on Capitol Hill. ``This is embarrassing
stuff. It's not really what you want to watch in mixed company.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly before noon, people began crowding into Duty's
restaurant and Clinton jokes began flowing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a lot of fun,'' a relieved Duty said later. ``We asked
people if they wanted to sit in the non-smoking, G-rated section or
the smoking, R-rated section. And we got parental consent before we
let children sit up front.''
</P>
<P>
   In the TV room at McLennan Community College in Waco, Sarah
Perkins and Brandie Meyer chatted furiously Monday morning,
ignoring Clinton's testimony. ``They ask the same questions, over
and over,'' complained Perkins, 21, a general studies student. ``I
don't care anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Meyer said Clinton's testimony shouldn't have been aired on all
three networks. ``Definitely not,'' she said. ``We're missing 'The
Young and the Restless.'''
</P>
<P>
   At breakfast buffets, barber shops, college campuses and
department stores back in the nation's capital, few residents were
glued to the tube.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fed up with it,'' said William Ransford, a Washington
native who has worked for 20 years as a housekeeper at the downtown
Renaissance Mayflower Hotel. ``How many times is a man going to
apologize? I don't want to see it. This makes him look weak. This
makes our country look disunited.''
</P>
<P>
   It was business as usual Monday morning at the historic hotel,
where world leaders sometimes stay. People sipped coffee, ate fancy
breakfasts and discussed politics and world events in a
flower-filled, lavishly-draped dining area. But there wasn't a
television in sight.
</P>
<P>
   At nearby George Washington University, more than 50 students
gathered in a dining hall. But few paid close attention to the
large television screen. Freshman Margaret Scruggs showed only mild
interest in the president's testimony as she ate breakfast.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think its just some big soap opera,'' said Scruggs, 17.
``It's amusing in a way, but sad for the country. I think he's
finally telling the truth about what happened. He should stay in
office.''
</P>
<P>
   A handful of students, like Stephen Rosenlund, watched more
carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it is of momentous importance to the country and Mr.
Clinton's presidency,'' said Rosenlund, 18. ``I am skeptical about
why they released all this to the country, though. They claim it
belongs to the people . . . However, I think there could be
stronger political motives.''
</P>
<P>
   At Dean's Beauty Salon near the Howard University campus, the
video of Clinton's testimony served mostly as background noise.
Barber William Phifer said he is still a Clinton supporter and that
the president's relationship with Lewinsky only reveals that he has
human weaknesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``The testimony is really irrelevant,'' Phifer said
</P>
<P>
   The video also failed to change the mind of Jackie Eagan, 70,
who co-owns and operates Mr. Eagan's, a restaurant and bar which is
often a hangout for politicos and downtown lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doesn't he have a hell of a nerve telling people what's
appropriate,'' she said, responding to one of Clinton's answers.
``This is no big surprise, though. We already knew he was a liar,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   But few others at Mr. Eagan's looked away from their lunch
baskets.
</P>
<P>
   Just around the corner from the White House, Michael Black
served breakfast at the Old Ebbitt Grill, one of Washington's most
popular political hangouts. The restaurant decided not to air the
president's testimony out of fear the eatery might appear partisan
and because language in the testimony might be offensive. Black
said it was a good decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a waiter. I work for the public so I know I'll be offended
today,'' he said. ``I don't need any more of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Contributing to this story was Cox Washington bureau
correspondent Shannon Joyce as well as Angela Shah of the Austin
American-Statesman, Mark England of the Waco Tribune-Herald and a
team of reporters for the Dayton Daily News).

   ATLANTA _ It might have been from emotion or it might have been
the color control on the itty-bitty television, but President
Clinton's face shone a bright pink through much of his videotaped
grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The six Emory University students who gathered around the
13-inch screen Monday morning in Brian Oubre's campus apartment
said the president looked angry, defensive and dishonest, and if he
was not ashamed of himself, he should have been.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have a colossal ego, to drag your country through
this,'' said Oubre, a 21-year-old senior from Baton Rouge, La., as
Clinton either evaded questions about specifically what sex acts he
engaged in with Monica Lewinsky, or answered with what he and
others in the country now know are untruths.
</P>
<P>
   The students, friends and classmates, had already made up their
minds about Clinton before the airing of the videotape, and saw it
as just more embarrassment heaped on the man, his office, and the
nation he leads.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not worth what we're paying for this fiasco,'' said
Oubre, a history and economics major.
</P>
<P>
   The six students, a mix of Democrats and Republicans and one
Independent _ Oubre _ passed around a box of Kix breakfast cereal
and alternately hissed, laughed or rolled their at the eyes at
Clinton's definitions of what is, or is not, sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Either he's lying, or he's an idiot,'' said Chuck Divine, a
21-year-old biology and political science major who is also
president of Emory's Student Government Association. He is a
Republican.
</P>
<P>
   But though the students were dismayed at Clinton's answers, some
of them were also dismayed at the questions _ questions that seemed
to go far beyond simple fact-finding, that seemed to solicit more
detail than was appropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about JFK and FDR?'' said Suzann Arnold, a 21-year-old
sociology major from Marion, N.C. ``We didn't ask them these
questions.''
</P>
<P>
   She was the only one of the six who, when asked if they thought
Clinton should resign, was not certain that he should. She is a
Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   After about two hours of seeing Clinton answer or not answer
questions they thought they already knew the answers to, the
students started to slip away, to class, to naps, or just to get
away from the television.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus seemed to be that it was boring, but a little
painful.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, said Miss Stephens, other generations will be so
disgusted by what happened to this president, by both the scandal
and the salacious way his political adversaries insisted it be
presented to the American people, that they will be spared a
repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully,'' she said.

 &HT;    E-MAIL MESSAGES NOT SAFE FROM INVESTIGATORS' EYES, LEWINSKY
FOUND
 &HT;    By MARY BETH REGAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In late 1997, when a distraught Monica Lewinsky was
dashing off e-mail messages to a friend in Japan, she probably
never imagined those correspondences would be read by millions of
people.
</P>
<P>
   But when the nearly 3,200 pages of Independent Counsel Kenneth
W. Starr's supporting evidence became public Monday, the records
included many of Lewinsky's personal e-mail. In one she confided to
a friend: ``So it's over. I don't know what I will do now but I
can't wait anymore and I can't go through all this crap anymore. In
some ways, I hope I don't hear from him (Clinton) again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many people, Lewinsky assumed her e-mail messages were not
permanent, especially if they were deleted. But unlike telephone
conversations, which must be recorded to be preserved, e-mail
messages automatically live on in computer hard drives _ even if
people who send them don't realize it. For that reason,
investigators are turning more frequently to retrieved e-mail as
evidence in court proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are using e-mail as a substitute for telephone calls,''
said James X. Dempsey, senior staff counsel at the Washington-based
Center for Democracy and Technology. ``But they are also creating
records that are being used in civil and criminal proceedings.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no doubt e-mail usage is skyrocketing. According to a
1998 Forrester Research Inc. report, for example, 15 percent of the
U.S. adult population, or about 30 million people, use e-mail. And
that figure is expected to surge to 135 million people by 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Under federal law, e-mail messages have the same protection as
first-class letters or phone calls. They cannot be intercepted in
transmission without a court order unless there is evidence of
wrong-doing.
</P>
<P>
   The catch occurs when e-mail messages are stored _ and they
become documents. They're stored either on the hard drive of the
sender or recipient, or on the hard drive of an inhouse server or
an Internet service providers (ISP), such as America Online Inc.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all messages obtained by the government are from stored
e-mail, not transmitted e-mail,'' Dempsey said.
</P>
<P>
   It's possible to delete e-mail messages from a hard drive, but
they don't usually disappear until they're over-written.
</P>
<P>
   At the onset of the Iran-Contra debacle, for example, National
Security Adviser John Poindexter went into his office one weekend
to delete 5,012 of his 5,062 stored messages. Oliver North erased
750 of his 758 messages. Still, these messages were recovered and
included as evidence because a low-level White House employee
decided not to overwrite backup tapes.
</P>
<P>
   ``A civil servant decided somebody might come looking for those
messages, `` said Tom Blanton, director of the non-profit National
Security Archive at George Washington University and author of
``White House e-mail: The Top Secret Computer Messages The
Reagan-Bush White House Tried to Destroy.''
</P>
<P>
   Commercial ISPs, such as AOL, also must turn over messages if
ordered to do so by courts. Tricia Primrose, AOL's spokeswoman,
said the company has a policy of giving customers 10 days' notice
in civil proceedings. It turns over records immediately in criminal
investigations. AOL keeps e-mail messages on its servers for
several weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The scary thing about e-mail is that it's got the immediacy of
a conversation but the permanence of a letter,'' says Blanton.
``Generally you don't want to write anything you wouldn't want to
see on the front page.''
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Lewinsky never got that advice.
</P>

discrimination case brought by security officer Jesse Jones. But it

   SEATTLE _ Seventy-eight-year-old Margaret Watkins does not like
Bill Clinton, never voted for him and is angry that the leader of
the free world ``basically let his libido get the best of him.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet, as she sat transfixed before the television Monday
morning, Mrs. Watkins found herself doing something she had never
done before in her life: she was cheering Bill Clinton on.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe the way they keep boring in on the man with
all these crazy questions,'' she said after Clinton, for roughly
the eighth time, parried a question from prosecutors about whether
he had received oral sex from Monica Lewinsky. ``I don't know how
he's standing up under all this pressure, but he does it. He must
have nerves of steel. It's amazing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you know,'' Mrs. Watkins said with a rueful chuckle, ``you
do need someone as president who can withstand the pressure. I
don't like him, but I'll say this for him: he doesn't crack. We do
need that in our president.''
</P>
<P>
   As residents of the Ida Culver House, a retirement home in
Seattle's Ravenna neighborhood, gathered around a big-screen
television in the home's main living room Monday morning and
watched the president's videotaped grand jury testimony, a grudging
respect for him was one of the themes that emerged.
</P>
<P>
   Another, even as many residents admitted they found the
testimony to be riveting, was a clear sense of sadness that the
country was being put through the spectacle.
</P>
<P>
   ``We live in a different world these days, I guess,'' said Nancy
Cadley, 77, a retired nurse who served in a medical unit in World
War II and the Korean War. ``Could you ever imagine President
Roosevelt being persecuted like that, getting asked questions about
his sex life? I can't imagine that. It's unimaginable.''
</P>
<P>
   On the sun-dappled morning, Ms. Cadley spent most of the morning
just outside the room, picking flowers for table centerpieces and
restocking bird seed in the courtyard, but even she could not
resist peeking in a time or two to watch the president.
</P>
<P>
   There were certainly a few residents who disliked Clinton so
much they were glad to see him on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reap what you sow,'' said one woman who spoke on condition
that only her first name, Elizabeth, be revealed and who stormed
out of the room after watching for a few moments. ``I think he's a
_ well, I can't say it. He's a dirty rat. He lies, he lies, he
lies.''
</P>
<P>
   But among those who stayed, a much more common sentiment was
anger at the prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``This whole thing is a ploy,'' said Robert Kleitsch, 84, a
retired government lawyer. ``It's a fraud. These people are using
our judicial system to try to get rid of a political opponent, in
my opinion, and that's a very very bad thing for our country, for
our whole system. A very troubling thing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Howard Laurine, 85, a retired metallurgist for Boeing who was
visibly angry, said afterward that he believed prosecutors were
crucifying the president and he was infuriated that they were using
his tax money to do so.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he sinned and everything, but this has nothing to do
with his job,'' Laurine said. ``This is just wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   Douglas C.L. Stockdale, a retired vice president for American
Airlines, said : ``Would you listen to these questions? They're
going into an awful lot of silly details. I think it's a
disgraceful display of bad taste. This man is the president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Claire Freiheit, 82, a registered nurse who worked in Cleveland
and St. Augustine, Fla., before retiring here after her husband's
death, is a proud Republican who never voted for Clinton. As she
watched Monday morning, though, she forgot all about politics and
simply wondered about the man.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being a nurse, I feel for him,'' Mrs. Freiheit said. ``I think
he has a problem and he needs something, but I don't know exactly
what. He needs a lot of love, but I don't know where he will get
it.''

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Florida Marlins
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   When: Tonight and Wednesday at 7:05 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   Where: Pro Player Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   TV: TBS will televise tonight. Fox Sports South will televise
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Probable starting pitchers: Tonight, RHP Kevin Millwood (16-8,
4.16; 0-1, 8.59 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. RHP Rafael Medina (2-4,
6.43; first appearance vs. Braves). Wednesday, RHP John Smoltz
(16-3, 2.99; 7-2, 3.32 lifetime vs. Marlins) vs. LHP Kirt Ojala
(2-6, 3.93; 1-1, 4.50 lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   Series history: Atlanta leads the all-time series 40-32 but is
4-12 at Florida since the last three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Past meetings: The clubs are 5-5 this season. Florida has
compiled a 2-4 record at Turner Field; the Braves dropped three of
four in a July series at Pro Player. In their last meeting, when
the Braves took two of three on Sept. 11-13 in Atlanta, the Marlins
were outscored 17-10. The only Florida victory game in the final
game, when the Marlins riddled rookie left-hander Odalis Perez and
Adam Butler for six runs in the last three innings.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins leaders: Avg.: Mike Redmond (.324); HRs _ Cliff Floyd
(22); RBIs _ Floyd (90); SBs _ Edgar Renteria (41). Wins _ Livan
Hernandez and Brian Meadows (10); ERA _ Matt Mantei (3.08). Saves _
Mantei (9). Strikeouts _ Hernandez (160).
</P>
<P>
   Quickly: A season that has been historic for all the wrong
reasons is nearly over for Florida. For the first time in history,
a reigning World Series champion has lost 100 games. Many are to
blame, but few of them ever tasted the champagne. The Marlins have
used 27 rookies this season, 17 on the pitching staff, which the
Elias Sports Bureau says is a record since 1961, which it terms the
Expansion Era. The previous high for rookie participation had been
the 1969 San Diego Padres with 25. . . . Despite the 51-105 record,
worst in the majors, the Marlins just completed a competitive
series in New York. The Mets, in the middle of the wild-card race,
lost the first game 7-6 and struggled out of a bases-loaded jam in
the ninth to win 4-3 Saturday. The Mets won 5-0 on Sunday. The
Marlins, who completed a long 3-10 road trip on Sept. 7, are 4-14
this month and have won consecutive games just once dating back to
Aug. 13. . . . Medina, a rookie who like Bruce Chen is from Panama,
has been somewhat effective since he was restored to the rotation
in late August. He is 2-3 in six starts dating back to Aug. 20,
during which time he has yielded more than four runs only once. The
Marlins scored just one run behind him in three of those losses.
But control is a problem. In his last 16 1/3 innings, Medina has
walked 32 men. . . . CF Cliff Floyd, the club's top run-producer,
hopes to be available tonight after being carted off the field in
New York on Sunday, after a collision with SS Alex Gonzalez while
chasing a fly ball. He was to have an MRI on his right leg Monday.
. . . On the DL: 2B Craig Counsell (compound fractured jaw), RHP
Alex Fernandez (rotator cuff surgery), RHP Joe Fontenot (sore right
shoulder), INF Kevin Millar (broken left wrist).
</P>
<P>
   Who's hot: Floyd is hitting .381 this month with four homers and
four doubles. RF Mark Kotsay has 25 hits in his last 72 at-bats
(.347) with 12 RBI.
</P>
<P>
   Who's not: Catcher Greg Zaun's average is down to .199, 60
points below his career average. Nine of the 22 pitchers Florida
has used this year have ERAs in excess of 6.00. Sixteen of them
have more hits allowed than innings pitched.

 &HT;    CLINTON, PROSECUTORS SKIRMISH OVER PRECISE MEANINGS OF WORDS
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ From an opening skirmish over the meaning of the
``whole truth'' in the oath he had just taken, President Clinton
spent much of his grand jury appearance last Aug. 17 sparring with
prosecutors over definitions of terms.
</P>
<P>
   When does sex become ``sexual relations,'' what it means to be
``alone'' and even the meaning of ``is'' became major points of
contention in the videotaped testimony broadcast to the nation
Monday, as the president tried to head off charges that he perjured
himself in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors pressed Clinton for a concession that he had sat by
silently while his lawyer in a deposition last January read an
incorrect statement that ``there is absolutely no sex of any kind
in any manner, shape or form'' between Clinton and Lewinsky, a
former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what the meaning of the world 'is' is,'' Clinton
told the grand jury. He insisted that the statement was ``correct''
because when he gave the January deposition in the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit, what he termed his ``improper intimate
contact'' with Lewinsky had already ended.
</P>
<P>
   And was this improper contact a sexual relationship?
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said it was not. ``These encounters did not consist of
sexual intercourse,'' which he said was essential in the definition
given in the Jones deposition last January, when he denied having a
sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Jones, apparently concerned that the president would
use semantic arguments to dodge questions, had given Clinton an
explicit definition of sexual relations as ``contact'' with
specific parts of another person's body ``to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire.''
</P>
<P>
   Challenged by prosecutors before the grand jury, Clinton
acknowledged that touching a breast with intent to arouse, kissing
the breast or touching the genitalia would fit the Jones' lawyers'
definition. But not oral sex, ``if performed on the deponent,'' he
said, using the legal term to refer to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Questioned further, he said that oral sex does not fit the
lawyers' definition of ``sexual relationship'' if he were only the
recipient and not the performer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, Paula Jones' lawyers pulled out that definition, not
me,'' Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
   When prosecutors working with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr
tried to corner Clinton on whether he had lied in saying earlier
that he had no recollection of being alone with Lewinsky, the
president took refuge in a definition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, again, it depends on how you define alone,'' he said.
Admitting that he had been alone with Lewinsky in the Oval Office
suite, he pointed to the many aides and stewards that work around
him. ``So, there were a lot of times when we were alone, but I
never really thought we were,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton complained that deputy independent counsel Sol Wisenberg
had sharply questioned him at the outset on whether he knew was
telling the ``whole truth'' was.
</P>
<P>
   Returning to that topic later, the president said, ``You tried
to get me to give a broader interpretation to my oath than just my
obligation to tell the truth.''

 &HT;    Even with recent slide, Galarraga on brink of new Braves record
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI -- The certainties of mid-summer have faded upon Andres
Galarraga, who for several months rode hard with Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa but now wonders who moved the fences. He already has
churned out the most productive season by any Braves first baseman,
but while the heavy artillery still rumbles somewhere over the
horizon, Galarraga has cooled in the final weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Still ranking among the National League's top five home-run
hitters with 43, Galarraga enters the season's last week in his
longest power slide of the year -- 14 games spanning 45 at-bats.
Before his last homer on Sept. 6 off New York's Jeff Tam, Galarraga
had been letting one fly once every 11.5 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   As the Braves conclude their last road trip with a two-game
series with Florida tonight, it nearly has been forgotten he was in
line to break the franchise home-run record. Will this Summer of
the Thumper end with Galarraga muted?
</P>
<P>
   ``How many does he need to get the record?'' Chipper Jones
asked.
</P>
<P>
   Three to tie, he's told.
</P>
<P>
   ``He could do that before we get home,'' Jones said.
</P>
<P>
   It's no idle talk. Fighting through the 3-for-21 slump,
Galarraga found his stroke in the final three games in Arizona,
notching six straight hits in one sequence that included two
doubles and a triple to deepest center at Bank One Ballpark that
probably would have cleared the fence at Turner Field.
</P>
<P>
   He takes his streak to Pro Player Stadium, one of his fondest
venues where has a .310 career average and has hit nine home runs,
more than any visiting player. So it could happen. With five games
to play and his swing coming around, Galarraga can still catch
Eddie Mathews, who set the record in Milwaukee in 1953, and Hank
Aaron, who tied it in 1971.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not having any thoughts to break a record like that,''
said Galarraga, who already has more homers than any
right-handed-hitting Braves player in 11 years. ``I know I've been
struggling a little bit the last two weeks. But (the record) is in
my head. I think about it a little bit. But you can't think about
breaking a record.''
</P>
<P>
   History suggests Galarraga has a chance. He has gone through two
droughts this season that reached double-digit games, and when he
broke out, it was noisy. After going 11 games in late-June without
a homer, he hit back-to-back homers in the 12th game in his first
two at-bats on June 30. It was one of his eight two-homer games
this season. After a second slowdown from July 25 to Aug. 5,
Galarraga homered three times in his next 12 at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's that type of guy,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``He's hot
right now and when he gets hot, he can carry you for weeks. He's
already had a solid season.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga surpassed the franchise record for homers by a Braves
first baseman -- Joe Adcock with 38 in 1956 -- after 119 games. His
next RBI, 119, will break a franchise record for first baseman that
has lasted 109 years. Dan Brouthers set the record of 118 in 1889
with the Boston Beaneaters. Galarraga already has more homers than
any Atlanta right-handed hitter since Dale Murphy's 44-homer season
in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   But the franchise homer record carries its own cachet. Mathews
set the record in 154 games in the club's first season in
Milwaukee, when he finished second to Brooklyn's Roy Campanella in
the MVP voting. Aaron tied it in the same year he reached 600
homers, although he played only 139 games, because of injury.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless, it's a prominent neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``The odds are pretty good,'' Jones said. ``If he sees his
pitches, he's going to hit 'em. But I think he was, like everybody
there for a while, struggling for a period. Just a little out of
sync. He seems to be getting it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga had just come off his three-day suspension on Sept. 6,
when he homered to lead off the ninth inning at Shea Stadium
against the Mets during Atlanta's worst road trip of the year.
Plenty has happened since then. The Braves clinched their seventh
division title; McGwire and Sosa left for the home-run
stratosphere, and Cal Ripken's streak ended.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to put any more pressure than I feel right now,''
Galarraga said. ``I've got to get in a groove.''
</P>
<P>
   He appears to be already there.

 &HT;    Infidelity is Holyfield's toughest foe
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ As he closes in on becoming boxing's undisputed
heavyweight champion, Evander Holyfield has come to realize his
personal life is in far more need of repair than his professional
one.
</P>
<P>
   That the enlightenment has arrived belatedly at age 35 is not
without cost.
</P>
<P>
   One week after his second wife, Janice, gave birth to the
couple's first child, Holyfield confirmed in an interview that he
has fathered two children out of wedlock in the past year with
previous girlfriends. He now has nine children _ the newborn Elijah
Jedidiah; three with his first wife, Paulette, from whom he has
been divorced since 1991; and five others born out of wedlock to
four women.
</P>
<P>
   In the interview on his Fairburn, Ga. estate, Holyfield
described Janice as ``my best friend'' but admitted regretting the
couple's union almost immediately after they were wed in October
1996, one month before his first victory over Mike Tyson. The two
have been in and out of counseling since then.
</P>
<P>
   He declined to address the future of his marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield has won all four of his bouts since remarrying, and he
owns two of the three major heavyweight titles.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta Journal-Constitution became aware of some elements
in Holyfield's personal life about a week ago, but he declined to
discuss them until after his latest victory, Saturday night over
Vaughn Bean at the Georgia Dome.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield, who professes to be a devout Christian and maintains
a positive image worldwide, understands he is subjecting himself to
criticism from family and religious concerns. But he said, ``I know
everything comes out of the dark and into the light sooner or
later. It might as well be now. If you don't want nothing (known
about your actions), then do nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I'm not perfect. But I have overcome other things in
my life, and I will overcome this.''
</P>
<P>
   Two boys, Eleazar and Elijah Elias, were born 11 and 10 months
ago. When the women became pregnant, Holyfield said he was ``sad''
and ``angry'' about the state of his marriage and admitted, ``I
started going back to my old habits.''
</P>
<P>
   He told Janice of his infidelity and the impending births and
suggested they get divorced ``quietly'' to spare her any
humiliation. But she declined, and the two continued to attend
counseling. Nine months ago, Janice got pregnant.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield himself was one of nine children born out of we Edsall
is left preparing for both quarterbacks. ``I see them as both kind
of similar,'' Edsall said. ``They're both athletes and can run.
Curry can make something out of nothing.''

 &HT;    Russian hits paydirt in U.S. soil rich with female athletes
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ He is a Marxian nightmare: proletariat turned
entrepreneur. A political system crumbles in one country, women's
athletics booms in another, and Boris Lelchitski spins himself into
something utterly foreign to his former comrades.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Inc.
</P>
<P>
   He is a coach. He is a talent scout. He is a player agent and a
tour director and an expert in the import-export business _ whether
it be flying a team here or shipping a player there. He says he
isn't swimming in wealth, but he does drive a Lexus and has a
working knowledge of tax deductions.
</P>
<P>
   Goodbye, mother Russia; hello, mother lode.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard for even me to believe this,'' Lelchitski said.
``When I go back to Russia, it is hard for me to explain to people
what I do. Being in the service industry, it is hard to explain
that I'm not selling cucumbers on the corner.''
</P>
<P>
   It is only explained by the growth of women's basketball in the
U.S., which has spawned a cottage industry.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1990, Lelchitski was speaking only his native Russian,
living in historic St. Petersburg and coaching women's basketball.
He was doing what he had always wanted, living a good life with his
wife and two young sons. But the fragmenting of the Soviet Union,
the dissolution of Communist rule and the collapse of the
government-backed sports support system changed the political and
economic landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The Turning, as Germans refer to the post-Berlin Wall era, hit
women's athletics particularly hard. ``Women have a very tough time
now because everything is a wild capitalism,'' Lelchitski said.
``If you don't have a sponsor, that's it. There is no Title IX or
anything like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Lelchitski did not think he would lose his job, but he and his
wife felt it best to explore other options. That led them far from
St. Petersburg. Natalie Lelchitski went to work at the University
of South Carolina and moved to Columbia with one son. Boris and the
other son came eight months later.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told them I was taking a leave of absence,'' he said. ``But
when I came here, I stayed.''
</P>
<P>
   What little English Lelchitski spoke resulted from private
lessons in Russia. And when he arrived here, Southern accents made
it especially difficult to understand his new language. ``I went to
a gas station,'' he recalled, ``and when that (employee) opened her
mouth, I thought, 'Gosh, I must be taking the wrong language.' ``
</P>
<P>
   But he got a job coaching girls basketball. He organized an AAU
program, the Carolina Shooting Stars, which has grown to 100 kids
and six teams, four of them girls.
</P>
<P>
   Lelchitski had intended to pursue a college assistant job.
``Then I realized being 40 years old and a male coach in women's
basketball is a tough sell,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't a tough sale was Lelchitski's startup business in
1996: the European Basketball Report. His brief involvement with
AAU tournaments and camps, along with the influx of foreigners into
the college game, suggested a need for a scouting service so
coaches could learn about such players seeking scholarships. In the
first year, 35 college coaches paid $425 a year for a quarterly
newsletter detailing 35 to 50 athletes. The rate is up to $475.
</P>
<P>
   Among the players with ties to Lelchitski is Georgia freshman
forward Elena Vishniakova, a St. Petersburg native he coached at
Heathwood Hall in Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   One business led to another. When he traveled overseas to scout
players, Lelchitski would notice U.S. coaches doing the same. He
had taken his Heathwood Hall team to St. Petersburg in 1994 for
exhibitions and the Goodwill Games, and now he wondered: If I can
organize one tour for kids, why not organize another for coaches _
and for profit?
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he sold 35 coaches on the idea of attending a
tournament in Hungary. Lelchitski figures he pocketed 15 to 20
percent of every $1,490 fee. In July, he took 45 coaches to Moscow
for the World Youth Games and Turkey for the women's world
championships. Cost: $2,490 each.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty tough to go to places like Turkey if you don't
know where to go or speak the language,'' Lelchitski said.
``Coaches will get to see 350 of the best kids from all over the
world. So for anybody interesting in international recruiting, it's
definitely worth it.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Lelchitski played tour guide for the Virginia women's
team, arranging for sightseeing and a few exhibition games in
France and Italy for a week. Twenty-three passengers paid $2,800
each. Approximate profit: $11,000. Georgia, Connecticut, Notre
Dame, Duke and North Carolina have signed up for a tour next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   European women's national teams approached him to set up
exhibition games in the U.S., paying him $1,500 to $3,000 per game.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and Lelchitski is a partner in Global Sports Management in
Hartford, Conn., serving as the agent for about 20 pro players,
male and female.
</P>
<P>
   Lelchitski's company, Sports International Group, is less than
two years old. It consists of Boris and his assistant _ Natasha.
Lelchitski does not operate a monopoly. Other people in his adopted
country have started scouting services or tours. But few, if any,
are as diversified as he is.
</P>
<P>
   None of it would have been possible without the growth of
women's athletics, something inconceivable in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even now, when I go back and I talk to people, they don't
believe me,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To quote Connecticut coach Geno Auriemma, who subscribes to
Lelchitski's services: ``That's the American way.''

FLOJO PUT A FLUORESCENT LIGHT ON HER WORLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN POWERS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It wasn't so much the gold medals, which she won in triplicate.
It wasn't so much the times, which some people found literally
unbelievable. It was the style -- racy and edgy and undeniably
glam.
</P>
<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner, who died of heart failure Monday at
38, was a race car done up in Day-Glo, a sprinter who stopped the
show merely by spreading her polished six-inch nails on the
starting line.
</P>
<P>
   FloJo was fluorescent. She turned up for the world championships
in a clingy bodysuit that might have been borrowed from the Cat
Woman's closet. She designed and wore one-legged numbers in pink
and turquoise. She painted her nails a patriotic red-white-and-blue
-- and, of course, gold.
</P>
<P>
   Then Griffith Joyner came blasting out of the blocks as if she
were drag-racing down Sunset Boulevard, her brown mane streaming
behind her like jet contrails. (itals)You go, girl!(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   For three high-octane months in 1988, the Queen of Seoul was a
supernova. She appeared suddenly in the hazy summer sky above
Indianapolis, went blinding-bright across an early Korean autumn
then ... vaporized. When the Olympics were done, she took her three
golds and a silver, waved goodbye and dashed no more.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner was already 28, well past prime for sprinters,
and when eyebrows were raised about her astounding times -- 10.49
in the 100 and 21.34 in the 200 that stand as world marks even now
-- that was the reason. How did a woman get that fast that old?
</P>
<P>
   She had been unnotable Flo Griffith four years earlier, when she
won a lone silver medal against a boycott-riddled field in Los
Angeles and called it quits. She was working as a bank secretary
when Bobby Kersee, her old UCLA track coach and Jackie
Joyner-Kersee's husband, talked her into coming back.
</P>
<P>
   So Griffith Joyner went on a diet, hit the weights, worked out
three times a day and dreamed up a competitive wardrobe that came
off a fashion runway somewhere between Milan and Mars.
</P>
<P>
   Nobody had ever dressed the way FloJo did or run as fast. Who
else had the audacity to show up for a track meet dressed for Soul
Train -- and turn her rivals into spectators?
</P>
<P>
   When Griffith Joyner shattered the 100 mark during a routine
heat at the 1988 Olympic trials, European sports editors phoned
their correspondents to make sure the digits hadn't been
transposed. Wasn't it a 10.94?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the wind gauge wasn't working. Or maybe Griffith Joyner
was dipping into a pharmaceutical jar. Skeptics compared
before-and-after photos from 1984 and 1988, wondering where the
Popeye muscles had come from. Nonsense, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the rumors are about me and they are not true,''
Griffith Joyner insisted. ``I have never used drugs, I will never
use drugs and I don't need to use drugs.''
</P>
<P>
   Though US sprinter Darrell Robinson later claimed he had sold
Griffith Joyner banned human growth hormones, the doping labs
pronounced her body clean and her marks valid. Yet as impressive as
they were, her times weren't as stunning as her margins, the raw
shock of seeing a leap and a bound between Griffith Joyner and her
panting pursuers.
</P>
<P>
   The photos from Seoul all look the same -- FloJo solo, hair
flying, nails flashing, quads and hamstrings and Achilles and hip
flexors pumping. Griffith Joyner simply destroyed her events.
</P>
<P>
   She beat Evelyn Ashford, the defending champion, by so much in
the 100 that Ashford appeared to be running in the next race. She
broke the world record in the 200 twice in two hours. Then, minutes
after she won a gold medal in the sprint relay, Griffith Joyner
came out and nearly won another in the mile relay, running against
a fresh Soviet anchorwoman.

<P>
   No woman had ever done that at Olympus, certainly not with that
much flash. ``Amazing sprints and spectacular outfits,'' Primo
Nebiolo, chief of the international track-and-field federation,
mused Monday.
</P>
<P>
   There would have been little upside to sprinting down the global
runway for another quadrennium and Griffith Joyner knew that. So
she retired a few months later to design clothes (she created a
``mean'' and ``aggressive'' navy blue road uniform for the Indiana
Pacers), write children's books, model and act.
</P>
<P>
   She made an abortive comeback as a distance runner in 1992
(SloJo, one observer dubbed her). She sent in an entry form for the
1996 Olympic trials, but never showed. Supernovas only make one
appearance.

 &HT;    A record for the ages from a guy just doing his job
 &HT;    By Terence Moore
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Well, Dad isn't impressed. Just before he left his official home
in Milwaukee for his unofficial one along any fairway, he said
Monday over the phone about Cal Ripken Jr., ending his streak of
consecutive games played at 2,632, ``Out of all the records out
there, this one really doesn't mean as much. You're supposed to go
to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Then again, Dad can say such a thing. While Ripken took his
first day off Sunday in nearly 16 years, Dad once worked 31
consecutive years without missing a millisecond at AT&AMP;T.
</P>
<P>
   ``And,'' said Dad, 66, chuckling, ``It would have been 38 1/2
consecutive years if I didn't have to take a few weeks off to have
surgery on my knees in the early 1980s. All you have to do is stay
healthy. That's what I did, and that's what Ripken did during his
streak.''
</P>
<P>
   Uh, sort of. Since I never argue with Dad -- who likes to say
that he only retired because work was getting in the way of his
golf game -- I'll change the subject for a moment.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you've heard that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have soared
by Babe Ruth and Roger Maris in the category of home runs for a
season. They've done so with only open skies ahead. Still, somebody
will rise higher than the universe reached by McGwire or Sosa.
</P>
<P>
   As for Henry Aaron's No. 755, even Hammering Hank says Ken
Griffey Jr. is capable of surviving and prospering during the next
decade to own more homers than anybody in history.
</P>
<P>
   On and on, we could go, debating the chances of somebody ever
rivaling everything from Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak to
the number of times Harry Caray sang ``Take Me Out to the Ball
Game.'' But all the debating ends when we're referring to the
events of Sunday, Sept. 20, 1998, in Baltimore's Camden Yards.
There, Ripken told his bosses that he wished not to have his name
on a lineup card for the Baltimore Orioles for the first time since
early during his rookie season.
</P>
<P>
   When Ripken's world realized what was happening, it responded
with many of the hugs and kisses that the slugging infielder
received three years ago, when he became better than Lou Gehrig's
2,130.
</P>
<P>
   This time, instead of Ripken taking a victory lap to slap hands
with hometown fans, he tipped his cap to the New York Yankees
applauding in the other dugout in the first inning. Then he
accepted a hearty standing ovation before quickly becoming just
another guy on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really takes a special set of circumstances to get to this
point,'' Ripken said later, always in his soft tones. ``You have to
have a great determination to be in the lineup. There must be a
love of the game. You also have to have a degree of stubbornness.
Everything has to go your way. If I can do it, somebody else can do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth is, baseball can take Ripken's ``2,632'' and chisel it
into the record books forever. All you need to know is that Albert
Belle is the game's new iron man by entering his 328th consecutive
game Monday night. Belle must work 15 more seasons in a row before
having the chance to pass Ripken around Belle's 47th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   To catch Dad, Belle must work every day just shy of an eternity,
and then Belle needs a 6 handicap in the aftermath.

 &HT;    New hire completes Delta's top brass
 &HT;    By Scott Thurston
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The new executive lineup at Delta Air Lines is
complete.
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta-based Delta on Monday said it hired Robert L. Colman as
executive vice president-human resources, filling the last top
echelon spot opened by Chief Executive Leo Mullin's management
reshuffling.
</P>
<P>
   Colman, 53, comes from a similar position at General Electric
Engines in Cincinnati. He starts work at Delta next month.
</P>
<P>
   He'll oversee personnel issues and labor relations. Key tasks
include continuing efforts to repair morale, keeping peace with the
airline's powerful pilots union and staving off other organizing
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``He will shape our human resource programs and policies to
ensure that Delta attracts and retains the best possible work
force,'' Mullin said.
</P>
<P>
   Colman is the third executive vice president hired by Mullin
since he arrived at Delta a year ago. The others are finance chief
Warren Jenson and marketing chief Fred Reid.
</P>
<P>
   All three came from outside Delta, which until the early '90s
promoted most of its top executives from within. Of Delta's top
five officers, the only two who still fit that description are
Chief Operating Officer Maurice Worth and operations chief Harry
Alger.
</P>
<P>
   Colman replaces Robert G. Adams, who joined Delta from Pan Am in
1991 and left the airline in May at age 60.
</P>
<P>
   Colman began his career at Ford Motor Co. and had been with
General Electric since 1980. Jenson, the new finance chief, also
came from a GE unit, NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Colman brings an impressive academic resume. He has a political
science degree from prestigious Bates College in Maine, a law
degree from Vanderbilt University, and an MBA in industrial
relations from the Wharton School of Business at the University of
Pennsylvania.

 &HT;    Georges pounds Puerto Rico; Dominican Republic, Haiti brace for
disaster
 &HT;    By Shelley Emling
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   MIAMI _ Hurricane Georges charged across Puerto Rico late
Monday, packing winds of 110 mph and churning 20-foot seas.
</P>
<P>
   More than 10,000 people sought shelter in schools and public
buildings in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the U.S.
territories declared states of emergency while activating National
Guard troops. The storm knocked out electrical service and forced
many families to huddle in basements and walk-in closets.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Rico Gov. Pedro Rossello banned liquor sales, ordered a
price freeze on items such as water, candles and matches, and had
officials prepare more than 300 shelters on the island of 3.8
million people.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are really nervous because we remember the damage done
by Hugo,'' said Mary McClintock, a resident of San Juan, Puerto
Rico, who planned to take refuge in her cement home's walk-in
closet. Hurricane Hugo killed more than two dozen people when it
ripped through the Caribbean in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   Georges began pounding Caribbean islands overnight Sunday,
starting with the French territory of Guadeloupe, where the storm
uprooted trees as if they were houseplants.
</P>
<P>
   Georges also ripped off roofs, tore down phone lines, and
knocked out electrical service on Antigua, St. Croix, and St. Kitts
and Nevis, but no injuries or deaths were immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Georges was expected late Monday to hit Puerto Rico's capital of
San Juan, where nearly half the island's population lives.
</P>
<P>
   The storm's strength had dwindled since early Sunday, when the
hurricane sustained winds of 150 mph, but the U.S. National
Hurricane Center warned that Georges _ a strong Category 2
hurricane _ was still ``extremely dangerous.''

 &HT;    Southern buying plant to aid Texas presence
 &HT;    By Matthew C. Quinn
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Southern Co., gaining a foothold in Texas, is
purchasing a small electric power plant near Fort Worth to back up
its wholesale energy trading business.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlanta-based utility holding company announced Monday an
agreement to purchase an 80-megawatt natural gas-fueled plant from
Wichita Falls Energy Co. Ltd. of Fort Worth. The plant is in
Wichita Falls, 130 miles northwest of Fort Worth, and it supplies
steam to the Vetrotex CertainTeed Corp. fiberglass plant there.
</P>
<P>
   The deal marks Southern's first electricity-generating purchase
in Texas. It also puts the company on the home ground of
Houston-based Enron Corp., which is increasingly Southern's rival
in energy markets around the country.
</P>
<P>
   Southern has targeted four regions for the purchase or
construction of power plants to boost its growing wholesale trading
business. The four regions are the Northeast, California and the
desert Southwest states, Texas and the Upper Midwest.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a highly competitive generator and will give us a
presence in the extremely important Texas energy market,'' said
Thomas Boren, president of Southern Energy Inc. That is the
subsidiary making the purchase, and it will also market power from
the plant.
</P>
<P>
   The plant consists of three gas turbines and one steam turbine,
fueled by natural gas transported by the Lonestar pipeline.
Southern takes ownership in October 1999.

 &HT;    Overcoming barriers: Hispanics look within to curtail dropout
rate
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Kurylo
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When Guillermo Rodriguez looks at 11-year-old Domingo
Vargas, a bright but shy native of Mexico struggling to adapt to a
new culture, he remembers his own adolescence, when he moved from
Colombia at 14.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt a little awkward and out of place. I had to learn
English and become accustomed to the U.S. culture. There were
difficult times,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   With support from his parents, he graduated high school and
college, and got a master's degree from Georgia Tech. Today, at 24,
Rodriguez is an industrial engineer at Lucent Technologies in
Norcross, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to make sure he does well in school. I want him to know
there are opportunities for him,'' said Rodriguez, who has been a
mentor to Domingo since January.
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Rodriguez wants to be sure Domingo doesn't
join the ranks of so many other Hispanic children in metro Atlanta
and throughout the state who have dropped out of school because of
language barriers, the lure of a paycheck or lack of support at
home.
</P>
<P>
   While Georgia's Hispanic population is expected to double by
2025 to 346,000, according to the Census Bureau, no state program
exists to prevent Hispanic dropouts. And in metro Atlanta, which
had 17,742 Hispanic students during the 1996-97 school year, only a
handful of such programs exist, organized by individual schools or
the Latin American Association.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996-97 in Georgia, the Hispanic dropout rate was 7.2 percent
for students in grades 7-12, according to the Council for School
Performance, a state-funded agency that monitors public schools but
is not under the Education Department. The overall dropout rate in
Georgia was 5.2 percent. The Hispanic dropout rate was greater than
that of other ethnic groups in seven of the 10 school systems with
the most Hispanic students. Most of those schools are in metro
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Nationwide, the Hispanic dropout rate is about 20 percent,
according to the U.S. Department of Education.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has become a problem here,'' said Maritza Keen, executive
director of the Latin American Association. ``In cities like
Atlanta, where the Latino community is growing, we will quickly
reflect what's happening nationally. If we don't stop it when the
percentages are small, it will become a bigger problem later.''
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hamann, who studied Hispanic students in Georgia public
schools for his doctoral dissertation, said state educators are
still trying to figure out how to cope with the influx of Hispanic
students.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thought process statewde is still at a pretty beginner
stage,'' he said. ``The bulk of the state seems to be only just
beginning to explore what it means to have Hispanics here. In some
cases, educating the parents is critical. In other cases, you have
second and third generation Hispanics with different needs. It is
complicated.''
</P>
<P>
   In a few metro Atlanta schools with high Hispanic enrollment,
educators are scrambling to find ways to keep students in school.
</P>
<P>
   At Marietta High School, where 10 percent of the student body is
Hispanic, guidance counselor Dulce Gonzalez helped to organize a
program so that in the past two years, 20 Hispanic students with
good grades and attendance could study U.S. government, act as
mentors and tutors to younger Hispanic children and raise money to
spend a week in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Students who made the trip gained confidence and became more
involved in school because they felt as if they were really part of
the student body, she said. But she doesn't know whether she can
raise enough money to continue the program this year, she said,
because the trip costs each student $1,200.
</P>
<P>
   At Cross Keys High School in DeKalb County, 31 percent of the
student body is Hispanic. ``Our Latino population is growing at a
rapid rate, but it's still kind of new for us,'' said Principal Tim
Freeman, who described several programs designed to help Hispanic
students. Still, he said, ``it's difficult to reach every student
who needs help.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of our Latino kids have so many things going on, as far
as having to work to support the family. Some of them work 30 to 40
hours a week and still go to school. Many have significant
responsibilities at home, taking care of brothers and sisters,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Hispanics drop out for many other reasons, including language
and cultural barriers, lack of role models, and low expectations
from teachers and parents.
</P>
<P>
   As is the case with any child, regardless of ethnic background,
parents are key to the success of children. Marietta's Gonzalez, a
native of Puerto Rico, said she is trying to get more Hispanic
parents involved in school so they understand what is expected of
their children. ``You meet these parents and your heart goes out to
them,'' she said. ``They work two jobs and come home exhausted. Who
has time to ask, `Did you do your homework?'''
</P>
<P>
   Some, she said, do not expect their children to graduate,
because they may not be high school graduates themselves. ``Even
parents when they register say, `All I want is for my child to
learn English.' There is not a long-term goal of a better life that
will impact them in the future,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The Latin American Association's Keen thinks mentoring programs
may encourage more Hispanics to stay in school. The association
hopes to reach 100 students, ages 8 to 21, through internship and
mentoring programs in several Georgia counties this year, she said.
The goal is to match successful Hispanic business people with
Hispanic students who need role models.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez said mentoring is a social responsibility. ``I always
wanted to help children because they are the future of our
community,'' said Rodriguez, who meets weekly with Domingo and his
8-year-old sister, Edith.
</P>
<P>
   The internships also help. ``We get kids saying to us, `If I
wasn't doing this internship, I'm not sure I would still be in
school,''' said Keen. ``There are a lot of youth programs out
there, but not for Latinos. They are the forgotten, the invisible
group.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, a national commission appointed by Education
Secretary Richard Riley finished a three-year study of the issue.
The Hispanic dropout rate is ``shockingly and unacceptably high,''
the panel concluded. ``Dropouts diminish our democracy, our society
and their own opportunities.''
</P>
<P>
   In its report, called ``No More Excuses,'' the panel said
today's dropout rate for Hispanics is 2.5 times the rate for blacks
and 3.5 times the rate for white non-Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   State Department of Education officials said they are concerned
about every student who drops out, but they do not believe
Georgia's Hispanic dropout rate is high. One official, however,
said he was surprised at the Hispanic dropout figures for school
systems with high Hispanic enrollments.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some areas here that need to be targeted,'' said
Roan Garcia-Quintana, director of the state's English to Speakers
of Other Languages programs and Title I federal programs to assist
low-income students. ``You've got some disparity here.''
</P>
<P>
   The solution, he said, is not a program to prevent Hispanic
dropouts, but more emphasis on getting all children to master
reading and math in elementary school. ``Have the same high
expectations for everybody and go in early,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Within the educational system and among advocates for Hispanic
students, many believe educators and administrators may not be
aware of how many Hispanics are dropping out because they are
tackling so many other issues and this is not a priority.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you have an issue like this that's somewhat isolated
in spots across the state, it probably doesn't get on the agenda
the way that more pervasive problems like reading scores do,'' said
Gary Henry, director of the Council for School Performance. Keen
said many schools are preoccupied with other problems, such as
school violence. ``The Hispanic dropout rate is another problem on
top of all the other issues they have,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Hamann said, some educators think Hispanic students
are here temporarily, so they do not need special help.
</P>
<P>
   Javier Gonzalez, a migrant education counselor in southwest
Georgia, said he has heard educators refer to migrant children,
most of whom are Mexican, as ``your kids'' and all other students
as ``our kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Hispanic students ``present a special challenge for the whole
school system,'' he said. ``It's easier to push them under the rug.
We're trying to get them (educators) to accept that they are
responsible for all students in their school system,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Gonzalez speaks from experience. The fourth of nine children
born to Mexican migrant workers, he earned straight A's but dropped
out of school in 9th grade. He was 17. ``I was just too old to have
three more years of school,'' he said. ``Besides, with the
lifestyle we had, I had to help provide for the family. The income
was needed.''
</P>
<P>
   A high school guidance counselor encouraged him to get his GED
and enroll in college. He got a degree in criminal justice from
Georgia Southern University, becoming the first college graduate in
his family. This summer, he got a master's degree in education
administration from Columbus State University.
</P>
<P>
   For the past five years, he has worked in Americus for the
federally funded Georgia Migrant Education Program.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to get them to think about what they want to be doing
two or three years from now. I tell them that it will help them
more in the long run if they stay in school,'' said Gonzalez, 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I regret dropping out. I missed out on a lot,'' he said. ``Now
I feel like I am contributing something good. I am a
professional.''

<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ After watching the videotape of President
Clinton's grand jury testimony on television Monday, Gov. Christie
Whitman of New Jersey called for him to resign, saying that ``his
disdain for the truth is a national disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement she gave in the midst of a five-day trade mission
that brought her to Mexico with 30 executives from top New Jersey
companies, Mrs. Whitman, a Republican, said that she was most
offended by Clinton's argument that his relationship with Monica
Lewinsky did not fit a narrow legal definition of sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard some of the definitions about what applied to
whom when, it was just mind-boggling,'' Whitman said. ``I don't
know what I can believe of what this president says now or in the
future about this or any other issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Whitman said that she had reached a personal decision after
catching portions of the grand jury videotapes on television in her
hotel room and at the U.S. Embassy here. She said she did not
consult with other members of the Republican Party about her
announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans have worried that it might hurt their chances
in the next presidential election if Vice President Al Gore, who
has remained largely on the sidelines of the Lewinsky scandal,
steps into Clinton's position now. But Whitman said the political
calculus around Gore was ``immaterial'' to her decision.
</P>
<P>
   She made no criticism of Kenneth Starr, the independent council
who has been accused by Clinton and his allies of conducting a
prurient investigation into the president's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is of the president's own making,'' she said. ``He could
have put this to rest seven months ago. But now we can't put this
genie back into the bottle.''

MALAYSIA LEADER SEEN UNTOUCHED AMID UNREST 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ The arrest of Malaysia's ousted deputy prime
minister Sunday night, and a crackdown on his supporters Monday,
may stoke anti-government sentiment for the moment. But many
analysts say the movement is unlikely to threaten the hold of
Asia's longest-serving leader, Mahathir Mohamad.
</P>
<P>
   Government critics Monday denounced the arrest of the sacked
deputy prime minister, Anwar Ibrahim, on sodomy charges. They
described it as a desperate bid by a power-crazy Mahathir to
discredit credible opposition. Anwar allies pointed to protests
that have drawn thousands as proof that Malaysia is ripe for a
movement like the one that pressured Indonesian President Suharto
to step down last May.
</P>
<P>
   But other observers have asserted that Malaysia's economic
problems are not as extreme as Indonesia's, nor is Mahathir an
autocrat to rival Suharto, even though he has a firm grip on
police, courts and the press. Those factors, as well as a
preference among Malaysians for a calm transition through
elections, make people less likely to take to the streets in
prolonged protest _ especially behind a longtime senior official
who only now is calling for ``reformasi,'' the term first used by
Indonesians calling for reform.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is hard to dismiss two days of demonstrations by
thousands in a nation that has not seen such large-scale protests
in at least 24 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is the beginning of a massive change. Anwar's
case has been a catalyst for uprising. A lot of grassroots are
supporting him because they identify with his problems _ a lack of
access to media, to any social space,'' said Tian Chua, a spokesman
for a human rights group known as SUARAM, the initials for the
Voice of the Malaysian People. ``Even if Mahathir uses his usual
tactics of terror and repression, this time it might not be as
effective.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday, police chased and fired tear gas at 5,000 people who had
gathered at a courthouse in the capital to protest Anwar's arrest.
Anwar, whose image is that of pious family man, was to be charged
Monday with indecency _ charges he has denied, despite confessions
and convictions of two men who said they participated in sodomy
with him. The accusations first surfaced over a year ago, but
Mahathir defended Anwar until his protege challenged him at a party
congress three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the arrest for sodomy, Anwar was held Monday under the
Internal Security Act, on charges of having led rallies without
police permission since he was removed from office on Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, about 35,000 to 50,000 people massed at the National
Mosque to hear Anwar, who is identified with Islam and with
Western-style economic policies. Witnesses said several thousand
listeners marched from Merdeka, or Freedom, Square to Mahathir's
home, chanting for his resignation. Mahathir has been prime
minister for 17 years.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested top Anwar allies Monday, and detained at least
50 street protesters. Two politicians and four student activists
who supported Anwar were held under the Internal Security Act,
raising fears of a crackdown like one in 1987, when more than 100
government critics were detained without trial. Anwar was a senior
official when the security act was invoked against his former
opposition comrades.
</P>
<P>
   The tensions coincided with a visit by Britain's Queen Elizabeth
II and the close of the Commonwealth Games, hosted in Asia for the
first time. Kuala Lumpur's blue-chip stock index fell 3.8 percent
on anxiety over the unrest.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps more important to the future of the protest movement
than the record of Anwar, its main symbol, are the contrasts
between Malaysia and Indonesia, where a popular movement managed to
bring down an autocrat.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts note that the socioeconomic gulf between rich and poor
is far more dramatic in Indonesia than in Malaysia, making an
uprising against economic meltdown less likely.
</P>
<P>
   Chandra Muzaffar, professor of political science at the
University of Malaya, noted that while Indonesia had a
``quasi-military regime,'' Malaysia has had a civilian government,
which has ``made way for democratic space.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mahathir lost an election for parliament in '69, so he's been
in power and out of power. You can't compare that to Suharto who
was never elected. That said, there are concerns about increasing
centralization of power...and some institutions are not being run
the way they should _ the Attorney General's office, courts,'' said
Muzaffar.
</P>
<P>
   But whether a movement to change those institutions can sustain
itself ``is a very big question now that Anwar is out of the
picture,'' he said.

HURRICANE BUFFETS PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, P.R. _ Still dangerous but with its strength somewhat
diminished, Hurricane Georges swept into Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands Monday after leaving a trail of destruction in the
smaller islands of the northeastern Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the storm, which the National Hurricane Center in
Miami has classified as the most powerful and menacing of the
season, was expected to pass just south of San Juan on Monday
evening. Since the weekend, the storm has been on a course that
would take it diagonally across the full length of Puerto Rico for
a period of nearly 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   The storm has weakened somewhat since Sunday morning, when it
had maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour, almost enough to
make it a Category 5 storm, the most dangerous on the
Saffir-Simpson scale used to rank hurricanes. By Monday afternoon,
its peak winds had diminished to 110 mph with occasional gusts of
up to 150 mph, making it a Category 2 storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day we were comparing this one to Hurricane Hugo,
but it has lost a bit of steam now and will likely lose a little
more as it crosses Puerto Rico,'' said Brian Maher, a forecaster at
the National Hurricane Center. ``It won't have a chance to
intensify again until it gets away from the islands and out over
open water again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the authorities here and in the Virgin Islands
continued to warn residents to remain indoors or, if their homes
are in coastal areas or made of flimsy material, to move to
shelters in schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect there is going to be major damage, and some families
are going to have difficult days to come,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello
cautioned at midday as the first strong winds and rain were
beginning to be felt here.
</P>
<P>
   In the Virgin Islands, Gov. Roy Schneider had already imposed an
8 p.m. curfew and, like Rossello, asked President Clinton in
advance to declare a federal state of emergency so that disaster
relief could flow more rapidly once the storm passed. Advance teams
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red
Cross were in place in both American territories, and FEMA had
organized a 62-member search-and-rescue team in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday afternoon, Rossello said that both
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki had called him and
offered New York's help in any cleanup and reconstruction. Puerto
Ricans living in the continental United States have also inquired
about providing assistance, he said, adding that a decision whether
the aid will be needed would be made only after he had assessed the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Leeward Islands, which suffered a direct hit by the
storm on Sunday night and early Monday, that process was already
under way. Initial reports said the hardest-hit islands appeared to
be Antig and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, both independent
countries; the British colony of Montserrat, and the French
overseas territory of Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   On all those islands, the authorities reported that buildings
had been ripped apart and power lines damaged. But as of
midafternoon, no fatalities had been reported anywhere along the
storm's west-northwesterly path.
</P>
<P>
   After traversing Puerto Rico, the storm is expected to hit the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where hurricane
warnings are already in effect. Once the storm reaches the eastern
tip of Cuba, however, its course becomes less predictable, and
meteorologists warn that it could take a turn. It is too early,
they say, for anyone's guard to be lowered, even along the United
States' Gulf Coast.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Monica Lewinsky told federal grand jurors that ``no
one ever asked me to lie, and I was never promised a job for my
silence,'' according to testimony released Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Other evidence that might be exculpatory to President Clinton,
including testimony from his friend Vernon Jordan, his secretary,
Betty Currie, and deputy White House counsel Bruce Lindsay, is
still in boxes in a House office building and has not been made
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given what's there in the Lewinsky testimony, we can't wait to
get our hands on the other witness testimony,'' said a lawyer close
to the Clinton defense team. ``Much of what she says is quite
helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer said that the evidence released Monday offered the
best examples of how the report that Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr sent Congress was ``not a fair summary of the
evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's statement that she was never encouraged to lie
about her relationship with the president, repeated several times
in different forms in her three days of grand jury testimony last
month, does not appear in the text of Starr's report.
</P>
<P>
   The statement contradicts two of the charges that Starr said
could amount to impeachable offenses. One charge was that the
president and Ms. Lewinsky had an understanding that they would lie
about their relationship under oath in the Paula Jones lawsuit.
Another charge was that the president obstructed justice by helping
Ms. Lewinsky find a job in New York to dissuade her from testifying
truthfully.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than quote Ms. Lewinsky's direct statement that she had
never been asked to lie, Starr characterized her testimony this
way: ``Ms. Lewinsky has stated that the president never explicitly
told her to lie. Instead, as she explained, they both understood
from their conversations that they would continue their pattern of
covering up and lying about the relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   The only grand jury testimony released Monday by the House
Judiciary Committee was that of Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky. More
testimony and evidence is to be made public after the committee
members and their staff have reviewed it.
</P>
<P>
   Another part of Ms. Lewinsky's testimony that could be to
Clinton's advantage was her remark that she had told Linda Tripp,
one of Starr's main witnesses, ``a whole bunch of lies,'' although
she did not know that Ms. Tripp was secretly recording their
conversations. Ms. Lewinsky and Ms. Tripp had been friends when
they worked together at the White House and the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Among those falsehoods, Ms. Lewinsky testified, was her
statement to Ms. Tripp that she had told Jordan that she would not
sign an affidavit denying a sexual relationship with the president
until Jordan had found her a job.
</P>
<P>
   Her testimony that this was not true could be important because
it explodes a central rationale Starr used to convince Attorney
General Janet Reno that he should become involved in the Lewinsky
investigation in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Starr told Ms. Reno at the time that evidence that Jordan was
helping Ms. Lewinsky find a job to keep her quiet fit a pattern
that he was investigating in other Whitewater witnesses,
particularly Jordan's assistance to Webster Hubbell, a Clinton
friend from their days in Arkansas.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's testimony corroborates Jordan's public statements
that he never asked for anything in return for helping her find a
job.
</P>
<P>
   At other points in response to questions from the prosecutors,
Ms. Lewinsky testified that Clinton had never told her to get rid
of the presents he gave her or instructed her to delete
incriminating material from her home computer.
</P>
<P>
   But more useful, according to the lawyers close to the Clinton
defense, is Ms. Lewinsky's description of the aggressive way she
was treated when she was first approached by Starr's investigators.
She was treated like a drug kingpin and not a young woman, one
lawyer said, buttressing the Clinton assertion that Starr and his
associates are zealots out of control.
</P>
<P>
   After they swooped down on her in a hotel bar where she was
meeting with Ms. Tripp in January, Ms. Lewinsky said, the
investigators essentially terrorized her. They advised her not to
call her lawyer. When she wanted to call her mother, she testified,
Jackie Bennett, a Starr deputy, told her, ``You're 24, you're
smart, you're old enough, you don't need to call your mommy.''
</P>
<P>
   She said that the investigators threatened to prosecute her
mother and told her that if she refused to secretly record
conversations with Jordan, Mrs. Currie and ``maybe the president,''
she could be imprisoned for 27 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was so incredibly frightening,'' Ms. Lewinsky said.

CLINTON'S TESTIMONY BOLSTERS BOTH SIDES IN IMPEACHMENT STRUGGLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony
fortified both his critics and defenders Monday, with his stubborn
legalistic dueling with prosecutors matched by expressions of
regret for his actions and concern for embattled White House aides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, battling 11 allegations of impeachable offensives
submitted to Congress earlier this month by special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr, jousted with federal prosecutors during four hours
and six minutes of tedious testimony that had been relayed to grand
jurors by closed circuit hookup from the White House on Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton quibbled with prosecutors over whether oral sex
performed on him by former White House intern Monica Lewinsky fell
within an agreed definition of ``sexual relations.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted it did not.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton contended that he and Lewinsky could truthfully deny
having carried on ``sexual relations'' under a definition endorsed
by U.S. District Court Judge Susan Webber Wright in Paula Jones'
$700,000 civil suit against the president because they had not had
sexual intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton refused to discuss how his semen got on Lewinsky's blue
cocktail dress, telling deputy special counsel Robert J. Bittman:
``That's a question you already know the answer to.''
</P>
<P>
   When the questions zeroed in on sexual details, Clinton refused
to respond beyond noting that his opening statement to grand jurors
had included an elliptical admission that he had engaged in
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Lewinsky during ``certain
occasions'' in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The opening statement said: ``These encounters did not consist
of sexual intercourse; they did not constitute sexual relations as
I understood that term to be defined at my Jan. 17, 1998
deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he would not respond to certain questions because
they would be ``forever in the historic annals of the United
States.'' Clinton added: ``I just think it's a mistake. And so, I'm
doing my best to cooperate with the grand jury and still protect
myself, my family, and my office.''
</P>
<P>
   The president challenged Starr's motives, portraying himself as
a victim of an open ended ``four-year, $40 million investigation''
by Starr that has ``come down to parsing the definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton decried a nationwide ``dragnet of discovery'' used by
Jones' lawyers to search for other women to support Jones'
since-dismissed sexual harassment suit against him.
</P>
<P>
   Jones' lawyers were eager to drag in Lewinsky ``so they could
hurt me politically,'' Clinton insisted. ``They just thought that
they would take a wrecking ball to me and see if they could do some
damage.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, Clinton claimed lapses in his legendary memory
when Starr's prosecutors politely questioned him. Clinton said he
``didn't have perfect memory of all these events'' that, he said
sarcastically, have ``become the most important matters in the
world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said he trusted the recollections of allies such as
lawyer Vernon Jordan and subordinates such as personal secretary
Betty Currie, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles or Deputy Chief of
Staff John Podesta more than his own memories.
</P>
<P>
   At tense moments during his testimony, Clinton's face flushed
red; his gaze turned steely; his answers narrowed to a single word
or two; his hands struck defensive poses, clasped before his face
or folded with his arms across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton sipped a glass of water or a can of Diet Coke at moments
of tension.
</P>
<P>
   The president firmly refused prosecutors' appeals on behalf of
grand jurors to continue the testimony beyond the four hours agreed
to in a deal with Starr that permitted Clinton to remain at the
White House with the support of three lawyers rather than being
forced to appear before a grand jury at a federal court house a
dozen blocks away, without lawyers present.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish I could do it,'' Clinton said. ``But we made an
agreement that was different, and I think I will go ahead and stick
with the terms of it.''
</P>
<P>
   He expressed empathy for his personal secretary, Currie, who had
been called to testify before Starr's grand jury amid her grieving
over the deaths of a sister and a brother. Starr's prosecutors
sought to paint Clinton's dealings with Currie as an effort to
cover up his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt terrible because she had been through this loss of her
sister, this horrible accident (at) Christmas that killed her
brother and her mother was in the hospital,'' Clinton said. ``I was
trying to do _ to make her understand that I didn't want her to be
untruthful to the grand jury.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defended Christmas season gifts to Lewinsky in December,
1997 as an act of friendship rather than an attempt to influence
her upcoming testimony in Jones' law suit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had for nearly a year done my best to be a friend to Miss
Lewinsky _ to be a counselor to her, to give her good advice and to
help her,'' Clinton testified.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, claiming that he was being as truthful as he could be
without jeopardizing his privacy, told grand jurors: ``You're
dealing with, in some ways, the most mysterious area of human
life,'' adding: ``I'm doing the best I can to give you honest
answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of my time and energy in the last five and a half years
have been devoted to my job,'' Clinton insisted, gazing straight
into the television hookup to the grand jury at length for the
first time. ``During this whole time, I have tried as best I could
to keep my mind on the job the American people gave me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton interrupted his testimony from a straight-backed chair
in the historic Map Room of the White House on six occasions for a
total of 76 minutes during testimony that spanned a period of five
hours 22 minutes. The breaks ranged from 5 to 23 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Just hours after completing his closed circuit testimony to the
grand jury on Aug. 17, Clinton went on late-night television to
abandon seven months of denials to publicly admit for the first
time that he ``did have a relationship with Ms. Lewinsky that was
not appropriate. In fact, it was wrong.''

<P>

</P>
<P>
   Clinton subtly raised questions about Lewinsky's state of mind.
</P>
<P>
   The president thanked Starr for granting Lewinsky and her mother
Marcia ``sweeping immunity,'' adding that ``it breaks my heart that
she (Lewinsky) was ever involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton equally undercut Lewinsky, saying that after he
broke off their relationship, ``she felt a need to cling more
closely or try to get closer to me.'' Clinton referred to her at
one point as ``obsessive'' having become ``somewhat fixated on
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the notes he received from Lewinsky showed that
``there was sort of a disconnect sometimes between what she was
saying and the plain facts of our relationship'' after he ended
their sexual liaisons.

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared visibly pained when prosecutors suddenly
injected a question about a conversation that Jordan said he had
with the president in which he relayed Lewinsky's belief that
Clinton would leave Hillary Rodham Clinton after the conclusion of
his presidency in order to be with the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can tell you, sir, is I certainly don't remember him
saying that,'' Clinton said. ``Now, he could have said that,
because, as you know, a great many things happened in the ensuing
two or three days. And I could have just forgotten it. But I don't
remember him ever saying that.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans watching the outset of the telecast saw a president
who appeared at times to be cornered by the proceedings. Clinton,
who has twice raised his right hand to be sworn in as president of
the United States, was forced to raise his right hand again to
swear to ``tell ``the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the
truth'' in the first grand jury proceeding in history targeting a
president for alleged criminal activity.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's eyes darted around the White House Map Room, where he
faced Starr and six other prosecutors; three lawyers from his legal
team and four others.
</P>

   Clinton shifted nervously in his straight-backed chair on
several occasions. He put on and took off his reading glasses; he
clutched his reading glasses in his hands as he gestured. At one
point, he waved a black pen.

   Lawyers said that Clinton shook hands with his inquisitors at
the outset and conclusion of the session.

FOUR FROM BAY STATE AMONG FORBES' WEALTHIEST 100 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOANN MULLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Four Massachusetts business people are listed among Forbes ASAP
magazine's annual ranking of the technology industry's 100
wealthiest individuals.
</P>
<P>
   The state's richest technology tycoon, the magazine says, is
Alan Trefler, 42, founder and chief executive of Pegasystems Inc.,
a Cambridge, Mass. maker of automated customer service software. He
ranked 23d on the list, with an estimated wealth of $583 million.
</P>
<P>
   Like most of the people on the list, however, much of Trefler's
wealth is tied to the value of his stock holdings, and the magazine
calculated its rankings based on stock values as of August 3. Since
then the stock market has tumbled.
</P>
<P>
   Trefler, who owns 75 percent of Pegasystems stock, is now worth
about $375 million.
</P>
<P>
   Others from Massachusetts who show up on the list:
</P>
<P>
   _Richard Egan, 62, founder and chairman of Hopkinton-based EMC
Corp., and his wife, Maureen, 61, worth an estimated $365 million
as of Aug. 3. While EMC shares were hammered along with the rest of
the market earlier this month, they have recovered nicely and the
Egans, who own 14 percent of EMC stock, are now worth an estimated
$380 million.
</P>
<P>
   _Patrizio Vinciarelli, 51, chief executive of Vicor Corp. of
Andover, worth an estimated $264.9 million as of Aug. 3. But based
on Monday's closing price, his 20.9 million shares of Vicor are now
worth just $185.2 million.
</P>
<P>
   Other New Englanders on the list are Cabletron Systems Inc.
co-founders Craig Benson, 43, with holdings of $216.7 million, and
Robert Levine, 40, with an estimated wealth of $102.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   They are not as wealthy as a year ago, however, because
Cabletron stock has slumped as the Rochester, N.H.-based computer
networking company has struggled to compete with larger rivals such
as Cisco Systems and Bay Networks.
</P>
<P>
   The stock took a beating over the past month, but has recovered
to about the same level as when Forbes ASAP calculated its
rankings.
</P>
<P>
   This year's list is dominated not only by executives from
established technology companies such as Microsoft and Intel, but
also by more than two dozen Internet millionaires who got rich off
their companies' stock offerings. Chances are, they too are a lot
less rich today.

CLINTON `QUITE MOVED' AS U.N. DIPLOMATS GIVE BELEAGUERED PRESIDENT
STANDING OVATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ U.N. diplomats stood together Monday to offer
support for a beleaguered President Clinton who appeared before the
General Assembly minutes after the nationwide broadcast began of
his taped grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Aides pronounced the president as moved by the rare display in
the normally staid, and sometimes hostile, world body and clearly
hoped it would quiet concerns that Clinton's international stature
had been compromised by his affair with a former White House
intern.
</P>
<P>
   The president's annual address at the United Nations opening
came just minutes after the House Judiciary Committee released the
four-hour videotape of Clinton's testimony before the grand jury
investigating his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Cable networks
aired the videotape as they received it.
</P>
<P>
   The embarrassing, and perhaps politically damaging, release of
the videotape vastly overshadowed Clinton's condemnation of
terrorism and his call for a worldwide response. The White House
throughout the day protected the president from reporters'
questions about the broadcast.
</P>
<P>
   The world's delegations, which included many heads of state such
as South Africa's Nelson Mandela, rose to give Clinton a standing
ovation as he was introduced, a move that the White House
interpreted as a symbol of support on a difficult day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was an expression by the international community of
the stature and regard in which he is held, their affection for him
personally and their very strong sense that strong American
leadership continues to be essential, particularly at a time when
many things are happening in the world that create great
uncertainty,'' said Sandy Berger, Clinton's national security
adviser.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lockhart, a White House spokesman, said Clinton was ``quite
moved by the warmth and appreciation that was expressed by
diplomats from around the world.'' Lockhart said Clinton did not
see his testimony being broadcast on television.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton called on the world leaders to make the fight against
terrorism a top priority. The United Nations became an island of
security as New York police officers stationed themselves every few
yards and sanitation trucks filled with sand blocked intersections
for blocks around the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it comes to terrorism there should be no dividing line
between Muslims and Jews, Protestants and Catholics, Serbs and
Albanians, developed societies and emerging countries,'' Clinton
said from the dramatic soaring stage at the United Nations. ``The
only dividing line is between those who practice, support or
tolerate terror, and those who understand that it is murder, plain
and simple.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said the world should unite to deny terrorists support,
sanctuary and financial assistance; to pressure states that do; to
cooperate on extradition and prosecution; to clamp down on the
manufacture and export of explosives; to beef up international
standards for airport security and enforce a number of existing
conventions on terrorism and chemical weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``No matter how much each of us does alone, our progress will be
limited without our common efforts,'' Clinton said. He declared
terrorism ``a threat to all humankind'' because of the greater
openness in the world and the explosion of information and weapons
technology.
</P>
<P>
   The president said he planned to ask Congress later this week
for an emergency allocation of $1.8 billion to rebuild the U.S.
embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and to step up anti-terrorism
efforts. U.S. intelligence sources believe a wealthy Saudi exile,
Osama bin Laden, was behind the bombings in Africa and several
other attacks against U.S. forces.
</P>
<P>
   The United States in August struck back at bin Laden's shadowy
supports, sending cruise missiles to destroy a pharmaceutical plant
in Sudan and to destroy several terrorist training camps in
Afghanistan where bin Laden resides.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in his address, also took pains to say the fight
against terrorism was not a fight against Islam.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many believe there is an inevitable clash between Western
civilization and Western values and Islamic civilization and
values. I believe this view is terribly wrong,'' Clinton said,
denouncing the ``false prophets'' who abuse religion for political
objectives. ``Americans respect and honor Islam.''
</P>
<P>
   After his address, Clinton met privately with Pakistani Prime
Minister Nawaz Sharif whose nation challenged India in a nuclear
arms race earlier this year. Both nations exploded nuclear devices
despite international pleas against it. Sharif indicated to Clinton
he will say something ``positive'' about the Comprehensive Nuclear
Test Ban treaty later this week.
</P>
<P>
   Berger said Sharif told Clinton that the warm reception he
received ``reflects the love and respect the international
community feels for you.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton met with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, Italian President Romano Prodi,
Swedish Prime Minister Goran Persson and Bulgarian President Peter
Stoyanov to talk about strengthening democracy.

CLINTON-TRIPP (Washington) - The documents released Monday in the
Clinton-Lewinsky investigation reveal a Linda Tripp even more
Machiavellian and backstabbing than previous known. She gave
seemingly kindly maternal advice to Monica, who told her in
desperate e-mails that she `loved` her and was glad to have her to
confide in. Tripp was so intent on entrapping the lovebirds with
her web of tapes that she may even have doctored a few, according

friend. By ADRIANNE FLYNN. Story will move int he ``A'' category. &QL;

LEWINSKY CALLS CLINTON HER `SEXUAL SOULMATE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN FREEDMAN  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In raw, emotional language, Monica Lewinsky told
grand jurors that ``there's work I need to do on myself,'' and that
it is ``not right'' to have an affair with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   Asked by one grand juror what sustained her sexual relationship
with President Clinton, Lewinsky boldly declared ``I fell in
love.'' And she described her feelings toward Clinton as ``more
love with a little bit of obsession. But definitely love.''
</P>
<P>
   The nearly 1,000 pages of transcripts from Lewinsky's grand jury
testimony and interviews with prosecutors and FBI agents under
Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr were among the 3,183 pages of
evidence released Monday chronicling the Clinton-Lewinsky
relationship, often in explicit detail.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Lewinsky's account reads like a turgid bestseller by
Danielle Steele or Sidney Sheldon. Still, many of Lewinsky's
steamiest descriptions of her White House trysts with Clinton were
blanked out by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   There was little in Lewinsky's account to alter the basic story
line unveiled in Starr's report to Congress, which was made public
on Sept. 11. She recounted her early flirtations with Clinton,
performing oral sex as he talked on the phone, exchanging gifts,
her implicit agreement with Clinton to hide the relationship, and
presidential confidant Vernon Jordan's efforts to find her a job.
</P>
<P>
   But the transcripts nevertheless make compelling reading
because, for the first time, the former White House intern is
speaking out in her own words. Lewinsky has not granted interviews
since her name became a household word in January, when the affair
was first reported, and her public appearances have been limited
mainly to brisk televised walks into her lawyers' offices.
</P>
<P>
   The picture that emerges is of a young woman who alternates
between intense romantic feelings toward Clinton, remorse over the
affair, and wisecracking humor.
</P>
<P>
   She said of Clinton, ``he was just sunshine.'' And she describes
the president as her ``sexual soulmate.'' Oral sex with Clinton
resulted from ``the passion of the moment,'' she said. ``We both,
really, just went to ... a whole other place together sexually.''
</P>
<P>
   The two never had sex in the Oval Office, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to Clinton's account, Lewinsky described the president
putting his hands on her breasts and fondling her so that she
achieved orgasms. At one point, she said, she bit her hand ``so
that I wouldn't make any noise.''
</P>
<P>
   In one clinical description, Lewinsky said that out of nine
instances when she performed oral sex on Clinton, the president
ejaculated twice. Lewinsky said she believed that by not ``coming
to completion,'' Clinton ``didn't need to feel guilty,'' and it was
``easier for him to rationalize'' their relationship.
</P>
<P>
   One of the two times occurred Feb. 28, 1997, after she told him
``it's important to me ... it doesn't seem right.'' Clinton
responded that he didn't want the two to become addicted to each
other, but nonetheless consented.
</P>
<P>
   A stain on the navy blue dress that Lewinsky wore during that
encounter provided Starr with a DNA match to Clinton proving the
relationship.
</P>
<P>
   Contrary to some media speculation, Lewinsky insisted she did
not keep the dress as a souvenir. Rather, she explained, she kept
it in her closet after gaining weight and only contemplated wearing
it again nine months later on Thanksgiving.
</P>
<P>
   Looking at the dress, ``I kind of thought, oh, this is dirty.''
Then she remembered when she had worn it last and ``I thought to
myself, oh, no.'' Her confidante, Linda Tripp, urged her not to
wear it on Thanksgiving, providing Lewinsky with alternative
clothing.
</P>
<P>
   It was Tripp, who worked with Lewinsky at the Pentagon after
Lewinsky's 1996 transfer from the White House, who secretly
recorded Lewinsky and turned the tapes over to Starr.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky recalled her discussions with Clinton on concealing or
denying the affair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him I could always _ I would always deny it. I would
always protect him,'' Lewinsky said. Asked about Clinton's
response, she said: ``I'm seeing him smile and I'm hearing him
saying `that's good,' or _ something affirmative. You know. Not _
not _ `don't deny it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Attempts at humor punctuated her testimony. Lewinsky talked
about how a ``bad hair day'' led her to wear her ``infamous''
beret, the same one she is wearing on the television news clip
showing her hugging Clinton in a White House receiving line.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, she said she and Clinton had a ``running
joke'' that she lacked the dexterity to ``unbutton his pants.'' And
when grand jurors asked her for embarrassing sexual detail, she
joked: ``Can I hide under the table?''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the predominant emotions of the transcripts are
regret, remorse and bitterness.
</P>
<P>
   Reminded by one grand juror that she had a previous affair with
a married man, Lewinsky responded that ``obviously ... there's work
that I need to do on myself,'' adding that ``normal,
quote-unquote'' single women don't do that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think most people have issues and that's just how mine
manifested themselves... It's not right to have an affair with a
married man.''
</P>
<P>
   She recalled feeling ``annoyed'' and ``jealous'' at television
footage showing Clinton and first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton being
playfully romantic on a winter break in the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   And she reported feeling hurt and offended by Clinton's
reference to her as ``that woman'' in his public denial of the
affair in January. In defending Clinton, White House aides
``trashed'' her and ``maligned'' her family. ``I had wanted him to
say I was a nice, decent person and that he was sorry this had
happened because I ... I tried to do as much as I could to protect
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky won over several of the grand jurors, with a few
referring to her as ``Monica'' during questioning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica, none of us in this room are perfect,'' one said. ``You
have my forgiveness,'' another said. ``Because we all fall short.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the nation watched President Clinton on
videotape Monday, many members of Congress on both sides of the
aisle had already decided that he lied under oath. Now the
question, which Congress is already starting to debate, is whether
that is grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, certainly
seemed to think so. In his report to Congress, he held that perjury
and obstruction of justice by any citizen ``are profoundly serious
matters'' and that ``when such acts are committed by the president
of the United States, we believe these acts `may constitute grounds
for an impeachment.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But the Constitution's description of an impeachable offense as
treason, bribery and other ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is
subject to continual reinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
   That profound constitutional ambiguity has sent Congress looking
through precedent, law, public opinion polls and Clinton's parsings
to decide whether his attempt to cover up his affair with Monica
Lewinsky should lead to his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said Monday: ``The president cannot
go before a grand jury and say things that are not true. What will
happen to the rule of law if he did that?''
</P>
<P>
   But he is only one member of the House Judiciary Committee,
which is in the vanguard of impeachment deliberations.
</P>
<P>
   And while many members of the committee now say they are certain
to recommend that the House open a formal impeachment inquiry, the
spectrum among its 36 members, all but one of them lawyers, also
shows that the ultimate decision on whether to impeach Clinton is
not likely to be clear or easy.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the preponderant view in Congress that Clinton lied.
But is that perjury? Not every committee member agrees.
</P>
<P>
   Nor do all members of the Judiciary Committee put the same
weight on the president's deposition in the sexual harassment case
brought by Paula Jones as on the four hours of grand jury testimony
aired Monday. In fact, some members of Congress are asking whether
this is a perjury case that any prosecutor would bring to court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., draws a distinction, for example,
between Clinton's testimony before the grand jury and his earlier
deposition in the Jones case. The civil case was ultimately
dismissed by U.S. Judge Susan Webber Wright.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always bothered me,'' said Graham, a Judiciary
Committee member who was once an Air Force prosecutor. ``Would I as
a prosecutor spend time and money to prosecute a guy who lies in a
deposition in a case that was dismissed?''
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal, he said, ``is to set the standard that if the average
citizen engaged in like conduct they would have severe legal
consequences.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum, one of Graham's Republican colleagues, does
not share his qualms about the Jones deposition. ``I have no doubt
in my mind, based on other cases,'' the Florida Republican said,
``that it doesn't make any difference if the case was thrown out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the other side, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is not even
certain that a prosecutor would bring a perjury case against
Clinton based on the grand jury testimony the country watched
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's `he said, she said,''' said Nadler. He noted that Starr
has presumed that Ms. Lewinsky is the one telling the truth, when
her testimony deviates from the president's. ``It's all based on
Monica Lewinsky's testimony,'' he said. While Starr found that Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony matched contemporaneous accounts she gave to
11 friends of her affair, Nadler said that she may have been
exaggerating to all her friends.
</P>
<P>
   To sort through precedent and the framers' intent, the
Republican and Democratic staffs of the Judiciary Committee have
independently given their members extensive legal research.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's members say they are studying the writings of legal
scholars, the report on impeachment drawn up by the Judiciary
Committee staff in the 1974 Watergate proceedings, a primer on
impeachment written by Charles L. Black Jr. of Yale Law School in
1974 and the case histories of the impeachment of judges.
</P>
<P>
   But impeachment proceedings have been so infrequent that even
these materials can take lead to different interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, who was an aide to the House Judiciary
Committee in 1974, has posted on her Web site the 1974 report on
Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment. In a sign of
her own thinking, she pointed her constituents towards its
observations and its conclusion as ``pretty relevant today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all presidential misconduct is sufficient to constitute
grounds for an impeachment,'' that 1974 report concluded. ``Because
impeachment of a president is a grave step for the nation, it is
predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with the either
the constitutional form and principles of our government on the
proper performance of constitutional duties of presidential
office.''
</P>
<P>
   That might seem to suggest that evasions about illicit sex would
not rise to the level of impeachment. But Canady looks elsewhere
for a model _ the precedent set by Congress in the impeachment and
conviction of U.S. District Judge Walter Nixon of Mississippi in
1989 for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon was convicted of lying to a grand jury about his talks
with a prosecutor in a marijuana smuggling case. He was accused of
concealing his attempt to help the son of a business partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was impeached and removed from office because he committed
perjury,'' Canady said, ``and the interesting thing is he committed
perjury before a grand jury on matters where if he simply told the
truth there would have been no legal responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet should a judicial impeachment be considered relevant to a
president? Federal judges are not elected but under the
Constitution have lifetime tenure subject to ``good behavior'' in
office. ``It's certainly the case that impeaching a judge and
impeaching a president has two different standards,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.

 &HT;    TAPE SHOWS CLINTON CLINGING TO CLAIM OF TRUTHFUL TESTIMONY
 &HT;    1030&AMP;add.
 &HT;    By SCOTT SHEPARD
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Americans viewed raw videotape footage Monday of
President Clinton delivering legally artful and combative grand
jury testimony about his sexual relationship with former White
House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was shown somberly acknowledging an ``improper
intimate'' relationship with Lewinsky but forcefully refusing to
characterize it as ``sexual'' despite evidence of oral and phone
sex. He steadfastly clung to narrow legal definitions to bolster
his claim that he did not lie in earlier sworn testimony about the
affair.
</P>
<P>
   The historic broadcast came as Congress, setting the stage for
possible impeachment proceedings against the president, released
3,183 pages of evidence that chronicled the relationship in graphic
detail.
</P>
<P>
   Despite widespread predictions that the tape would shift
opinions about Clinton, the first reactions indicated that it only
served to harden previously held positions _ both in Congress and
among the public at large.
</P>
<P>
   The two volumes of material compiled Independent Counsel Kenneth
Starr included the full text of both Clinton's and Lewinsky's
testimony to the grand jury investigating the president _ much of
it at odds both in tone and substance.
</P>
<P>
   It also contained notes and e-mail about Lewinsky's sexual
encounters with the president and others, plus a dizzying variety
of supporting material, from White House phone and visitor logs to
photos of Lewinsky's family in the Oval Office with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While Lewinsky's testimony is occasionally light-hearted _ ``Oh,
you really want to embarrass me, don't you?'' she says at one point
when prosecutors ask for details of sex with Clinton _ the
president's frequently falls back on legal defenses and technical
jousting over the definitions of ``sexual relations,'' ``alone,''
and even the verb ``is.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky's testimony contradicts Clinton's assertions on three
key points: that he never touched her body to arouse her sexually,
that he never advised her to sign a sworn statement denying their
affair and that their relationship began in January 1996 when she
was a paid employee of the White House. She claims he touched her
breasts and genitalia, she discussed her sworn denial of the
relationship with him and that the relationship began in November
1995 when she was an intern.
</P>
<P>
   And while she says that the president never instructed her to
lie to prosecutors about their relationship, ``I'm seeing him smile
and I'm hearing him saying, 'that's good,' or something
affirmative'' when she told him that she would ``always protect
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, in the videotape of his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony
from the Map Room, the same room from which he somberly addressed
the nation to acknowledge his relationship with Lewinsky,
reiterated what he has said before: that he never instructed
Lewinsky or any of his White House aides to lie to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The videotape pre-empted news coverage of Clinton basking in
thunderous applause as he addressed the United Nations General
Assembly in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Networks began broadcasting the unedited four-hour videotape at
9:30 a.m. EDT, preempting soap operas for what was expected to be
much steamier fare. But despite the graphically direct questions of
prosecutors and Clinton's occasional defiance, the broadcast
produced little information that had not already been leaked to
news organizations or included in Starr's report to Congress
released two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   It will be days before public reaction to the broadcast can be
adequately gauged. But one indicator, the stock market, responded
positively. When the broadcast began, the Dow Jones industrial
average quickly shed nearly 200 points. When it ended, the average
had climbed back into positive territory, closing the day with a
gain of just over 37 points.
</P>
<P>
   On Capitol Hill, however, the tape of Clinton's grand jury
testimony appeared to harden the lines between Republicans and
Democrats. Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, said Clinton's testimony was a ``classic case'' of
perjury and therefore an impeachable offense. But Rep. John
Conyers, D-Mich., the ranking minority member of the committee,
decried the release of ``irrelevant'' details about Clinton and
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, White House press secretary Mike McCurry complained
that the release of the videotape and other evidence gathered by
Starr constituted ``rank partisanship.'' McCurry said Starr and his
assistants tried to ``browbeat and badger'' the president during
the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, on the videotape, makes a similar charge in refusing to
answer some of the prosecutors' questions about the details of his
sexual encounters with Lewinsky. ``I'm not going to answer your
trick questions,'' he says at one point.
</P>
<P>
   At another point, he suggests to one of Starr's assistants that
``from the tone of your voice and the way you're asking questions
here, it's obvious this is the most important thing in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is most animated when he talks about the sexual
harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, contending
that his political opponents tried to use the lawsuit, which has
since been dismissed for lack of merit, as ``a wrecking ball''
against him.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has charged that Clinton committed perjury when, in a Jan.
26 deposition in the Jones lawsuit, he testified that the he did
not have a sexual relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton insisted to Starr's grand jury that his testimony was
truthful under the narrow definition of ``sexual relations'' used
in the Jones lawsuit. He said oral sex did not fall under that
definition, but did not specifically acknowledge whether he had
received oral sex from Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton visibly bristled when Starr's prosecutors asked whether
the narrow definition upon which the president relied in his Jones
testimony would ``include sticking an object into the genitalia of
another person in order to arouse or gratify the sexual desire of
another person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know the answer to that,'' the president replied.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky has testified that she used one of the president's
cigars as a sexual aid during one of their encounters.
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Clinton expressed remorse for Lewinsky being subpoenaed as a
witness in the Jones lawsuit. ``It breaks my heart that she was
ever involved in this,'' he said. ``It wasn't her fault. It was
mine.'' He even thanked Starr for granting Lewinsky immunity to
testify against him.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton said Lewinsky is ``basically a good girl ...a good young
woman with a good heart and a good mind'' who is ``burdened by some
unfortunate conditions of her upbringing.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of ``her psyche,'' he said, he anticipated that
eventually Lewinsky have to talk publicly about their relationship.
However, he denied that used his longtime friend, Vernon Jordan, to
try to ``buy her silence'' with a job after she left the
government.
</P>
<P>
   He also said he saw nothing improper in exchanging gifts with
Lewinsky. He said he gives and receives lots of gifts from friends.
He denied any role in trying to hide his gifts to Lewinsky from
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining the differences in his and Lewinsky's testimony,
Clinton harkened back to the contrasting testimony of Anita Hill
and Clarence Thomas in the 1991 Senate confirmation hearings on
Thomas's nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. Hill accused Thomas
of sexual harassment. Thomas denied it.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I heard both of them testify, what I believed after it
was over, I believed that they both thought they were telling the
truth,'' he said. ``You're dealing with, in some ways, the most
mysterious area of human life. I'm doing the best I can to give you
honest answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, in her testimony, called the president her ``sexual
soul mate'' and said he had ``a beautiful soul.'' She added, ``I
just thought he was just this incredible person and when I looked
at him I saw a little boy. I don't know what the truth is any
more.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bill Clinton has always loved nothing better than a
tough audience and, in the end, that is how he treated Kenneth
Starr's grand jury, starting shakily, then warming to his task,
unspooling every thread of wounded dignity, controlled anger and
confident elaboration at his command in a performance filled with
trademark touches.
</P>
<P>
   Like the lawyer he is, Clinton complained about trick questions
but sometimes finagled. Like the politician he is, he filibustered,
holding down the score and running out the clock. Like the fighter
he is, he tossed off veiled insults and condescending putdowns.
Like the pedagogue he is, he lectured. Like the scarred, tired,
defensive man he has become, he sometimes bridled and sometimes
just seemed to sag.
</P>
<P>
   Yet nowhere in the four hours and three minutes of his ordeal in
the Map Room on the afternoon of Aug. 17 did Clinton display any
emotion rawer than the anger he unleashed in his televised speech
to the nation that night.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, in muted and mournful tones in supposedly secret
testimony that he made clear he knew would become public, Clinton
actually said, ``I'm sorry,'' for misleading his senior aides about
his relationship with Monica Lewinsky _ two words that it took him
18 more days to utter in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may have been misleading,'' Clinton said of his initial
denials to his aides. ``And if they were, I have to take
responsibility for it, and I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Clinton also said, ``I'm sorry to say for
reasons I don't entirely remember,'' he once asked his secretary,
Betty Currie, to wait in the dining room off his private study
while he talked to Ms. Lewinsky. Mrs. Currie testified that she
waited on a night when the president and Ms. Lewinsky were in the
study, a night when Ms. Lewinsky says they had the fateful
encounter that stained her dress.
</P>
<P>
   In sum, most of the Bill Clintons the world has come to know
make at least a cameo appearance in this record that the president
himself at one point ruefully acknowledges ``will be forever in the
historic annals of the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   With unsparing clarity, the videotape captures Clinton the
shameless charmer, acknowledging that prosecutors could be forgiven
for thinking that the president must have acute recall about such
``embarrassing and personally painful'' events, and wishing that he
had more time to take grand jurors' questions.
</P>
<P>
   It also shows Clinton the cheapskate, confessing that gifts he
gave Ms. Lewinsky _ like a blanket from Radio City Music Hall _
were meaningless leftovers he had received as gifts from others.
</P>
<P>
   There is the empathetic son of a violent, broken home, who says
that Ms. Lewinsky is ``a good young woman with a good heart and a
good mind,'' who is ``burdened by some unfortunate conditions of
her, her upbringing.''
</P>
<P>
   In the next breath, there is the gimlet-eyed appraiser of human
motivation who says he had no doubt that once their sexual
interaction was over, Ms. Lewinsky would not be able to help
talking about it, because ``it was a part of her psyche.''
</P>
<P>
   There is the quibbler who argues about the meaning of the words
``is'' and ``truth,'' who draws distinctions about whether somebody
told him something on the phone or in a meeting, who describes his
conduct with Ms. Lewinsky by directly acknowledging only which acts
he had not performed, who contends that he was trying to keep his
aides ``out of trouble'' by telling them untruths.
</P>
<P>
   And there is the sheepish cookie-thief caught red-handed who,
when asked to describe how Ms. Lewinsky's dress might have been
stained, says, smiling faintly: ``You know what the facts are;
there's no point in a hypothetical.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Clinton's aides have long known that he makes his worst speeches
early in the day, and as he began his testimony at 1:03 p.m.,
Clinton seemed groggy and feeling his way. As he unfolded a piece
of paper and slowly read his blanket statement acknowledging
``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms. Lewinsky, peering over
half-glasses, he looked ashen, crumpled, flat.
</P>
<P>
   But as he took the measure of his interrogators, Clinton's
confidence grew. As they pressed for graphic details about sexual
acts, his anger grew too, though its visible, audible
manifestations were confined to a flexed jaw, a jabbed finger, a
spit-out ``sir,'' a terse and husky proclamation that he
``deplored'' what Paula Jones' lawyers were doing in their sexual
misconduct lawsuit against him.
</P>
<P>
   But as the president himself said in explaining an outburst at
Secret Service agents who had once told Ms. Lewinsky of a female
guest visiting him in the Oval Office, ``As I usually do when I'm
mad, after a while I wasn't so mad about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Clinton did his best to get even, at several points
larding his answers with parenthetical asides about the cost of
Starr's investigation, the political motives of his enemies, and
the ``pretty well shattered'' credibility of Kathleen Willey, the
former White House volunteer who has accused Clinton of making a
crude sexual advance to her in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   After denying that he had made any sexual advance to Ms. Willey,
who continued to write him affectionate notes after the purported
encounter, Clinton said she had asked for a meeting with him.
</P>
<P>
   When asked by a prosecutor whether she had made a sexual advance
to him, Clinton casually replied, ``On that day, no, she did not.''
Asked to elaborate, the president said coolly: ``I wouldn't call it
a sexual advance. She was always very friendly. But I never took it
seriously.''

MARKET BOUNCES BACK FROM STEEP OPENING DROP  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks weathered a sharp selloff on European markets
Monday and finished modestly higher, led by strong gains among
bellwether technology issues.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average overcame an early 185-point
deficit to close up 37.59 points, or 0.5 of 1 percent, at 7,933.25.
The advance leaves the Dow with a small gain for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, however, traders reacted with alarm to developments in
foreign markets, particularly in Europe, where prices on most major
exchanges tumbled on renewed worries about Russia and Japan, as
well as concerns over President Clinton's videotaped grand jury
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``A sense of foreboding about Clinton didn't help the European
markets,'' said one block trader, who insisted on not being
identified. ``And in our market the testimony was a big
distraction.''
</P>
<P>
   Every major stock market in Europe fell Monday, with drops of
more than 5 percent on the Swiss, Italian and Dutch exchanges. The
CAC-40 index in France was off more than 3.5 percent, the Dax index
in Germany fell 3.98 percent, and the FTSE 100 index in London lost
1.29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   There were also sharp drops in Asia and in Brazil. In Japan, the
Nikkei index fell 2.76 percent, and the Hang Seng index in Hong
Kong dropped 3.70 percent. The Bovespa index in Brazil lost 3.87
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The selling continued when trading shifted to New York. But the
early losses were reversed as the session progressed, and by late
in the session the Dow moved into positive territory.
</P>
<P>
   Some broader market indexes also had modest advances. The
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index rose 3.80, or 0.4 percent, to 1,023.89.
And the Nasdaq composite index was up 16.66, or 1 percent, to
1,680.43. But the Big Board's composite index fell 0.11, to 507.43,
and the Russell 2000 index dipped 0.68, to 362.58.
</P>
<P>
   Declining issues outnumbered those that gained by a margin of 4
to 3 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume fell to 609.9 million
shares, from 793 million shares on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Traders said the observance of Rosh ha-Shanah, the Jewish New
Year, and the broadcast of Clinton's Aug. 17 testimony helped
depress the level of activity.
</P>
<P>
   Some traders did say, however, that they were encouraged by what
has happened recently. ``We are climbing the infamous wall of
worry,'' one said. ``And with interest rates where they are, there
is no way stocks can go down. They can trade off for a while, but
then they will bounce back.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology stocks, which played a critical role in the climb of
the market averages and have had a leading part in the recent
selloff, were impressive performers Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Motorola gained 2, to 48{. IBM was up 3{, to 128 3/16. Microsoft
closed at 107~, up 2{. And shares of the 3Com Corp., the
second-largest computer-networking company, rose 1|, or 5.3
percent, to 32 1/16, on optimism that it will meet Wall Street's
expectations when it releases quarterly results Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Although many companies have already braced investors about
coming earnings reports, traders remain nervous about the numbers
that will be announced in the next few weeks. And they are quite
willing to punish companies that have unexpected bad news.
</P>
<P>
   An example yesterday was Praxair Inc. The company, the
third-largest supplier of industrial gases, said that earnings for
its 1998 fiscal year would be less than expected because of slower
domestic sales.
</P>
<P>
   Traders responded by pounding Praxair's stock, pushing it down
by 2 13/16, or nearly 8 percent, to 32 13/16.
</P>
<P>
   And Praxair was not alone.
</P>
<P>
   The American depository receipts of Philips Electronics fell 5,
or 9.8 percent, to 46, after the Dutch company warned that its
third-quarter results would be lower than expected. And shares of
Xerox lost 4, to 79 9/16, after analysts at Lehman Brothers cut
1998 earnings estimates, citing the company's exposure in Latin
America.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market is in a recovery that began at the start of the
month,'' said Phil Roth, chief technical analyst at Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter. ``But it has not really demonstrated sustained
strength. We have had shake-outs, and it has held. But we are not
seeing genuine investment demand. I don't think the selloff is
over.''

LEGAL SPECIALISTS SEE DEFENSE POSSIBILITIES IN TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER S. CANELLOS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ He went into his deposition in the Paula Jones case
wanting to be truthful but ``not particularly helpful.'' He relied
on hair-splitting distinctions to avoid admitting a sexual
relationship. He freely took refuge in saying ``I don't recall''
when a fuller answer would have yielded embarrassing details.
</P>
<P>
   After watching President Clinton spin a web of legalistic
explanations for his evasions in the Jones case, some specialists
Monday came away convinced that, by the narrow standards of the
courtroom, he could mount a plausible defense to charges of perjury
and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   Technical defenses might not play well in an impeachment
inquiry, where a higher standard of truthfulness might apply, they
warned, and their effect on the public at large is also a question
mark. Still, the president's explanations to the grand jury,
tortured as they may be, could end up satisfying a crucial
constituency in the court of public opinion _ those who are
inclined to support him so long as he did not violate his oath to
uphold the law.
</P>
<P>
   To prove perjury, for example, a prosecutor must show that the
president intended to give false statements. If he truly set out to
give evasive answers, and only slipped into falsehoods
accidentally, like a gymnast sliding off the balance beam, he might
not be legally culpable.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key question is do you believe that that's what he was
trying to do, trying to walk a very narrow line?'' said Gerard
Lynch, former chief of the criminal division of the US attorney's
office in Manhattan. ``Then, if he fell over the line and said
something specifically false, it was based on misunderstanding, not
an intent to say something deliberately false.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Bruce E. Yannett, a former Iran-Contra prosecutor, ``The
issue is not whether a reasonable person believes the president had
a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. The issue is whether
the president's application of the definition of sexual relations
that was given to him indicates that he meant to commit perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   Such distinctions might satisfy a court, Lynch and Yannett said,
but, asked Lynch, ``Is this appropriate behavior for a president?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has long maintained that he deliberately answered
questions in the Jones deposition narrowly. Some people, knowing
his tendency to take refuge in explanations like he ``didn't
inhale'' when he smoked marijuana, have argued that Clinton's
parsing of the truth is a character flaw. Ironically, if he were a
habitual trimmer of the truth, it could weigh against the notion
that he deliberately set out to lie in this case, legal specialists
said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in his grand-jury testimony, Clinton sought to lay out a
more sympathetic context for his evasions in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   He was convinced, he said, that Jones's lawyers wanted to ``hurt
me politically'' and ``take a wrecking ball to me.'' Therefore, he
resolved to be truthful but not helpful. He offered answers that
were technically true, but not revealing. Point by point, the
president explained that he wasn't trying to lie or obstruct
justice, merely cast his actions in the most politically palatable
light:
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton denied in the deposition having sexual relations with
Lewinsky because the definition of sex offered by Jones' lawyers
covered oral sex only if the person being deposed was the active
participant. He was not, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, however, has testified that the president touched her
breasts and genitals, suggesting Clinton had sex with her even by
his own narrow interpretation of the definition. Clinton, however,
parsed the definition even further in his grand jury testimony. The
president claimed at least six times that the definition only
covered the touching of certain body parts ``with the intent to
arouse or gratify.''
</P>
<P>
   _Clinton affirmed, under oath during the Jones case deposition,
the accuracy of Lewinsky's own affidavit in the Jones case, which
broadly denied any sexual relationship. In his grand-jury
testimony, Clinton suggested that Lewinsky had been truthful if her
definition of sex was limited to intercourse. Even by a broader
definition, he said, the denial was true ``at the present time,''
because they were not in an intimate relationship when she was
deposed in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton's lawyer Robert Bennett claimed during the president's
deposition in the Jones case that Lewinsky had denied a sexual
relationship ``in any manner, shape or form.'' Before the grand
jury, Clinton said he wasn't paying attention to Bennett's
statement and that, in any case, defendants aren't legally
responsible for their lawyers' statements _ which is strictly true,
specialists said.
</P>
<P>
   --Clinton testified in the Jones deposition that he ``didn't
recall'' whether he had ever been alone with Lewinsky. To the grand
jury, he explained his fuzzy memory by noting that presidents are
always liable to be interrupted by stewards, aides, or guards, and
that he couldn't remember if any such interruptions occurred during
Lewinsky's visits.
</P>
<P>
   --After giving his deposition, Clinton acknowledged, he spoke to
his secretary, Betty Currie, about whether she had ever seen him
and Lewinsky alone together. Currie testified that Clinton's
comments to her were more like statements than questions. Clinton
explained that he was trying to gather all the facts in
anticipation of media leaks. At the time, there was no criminal
investigation of the matter, and Currie wasn't a witness in the
Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Clinton noted, Currie testified that once she was
subpoenaed, he asked her to tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, conservatives like Washington attorney Stephen Smith,
a former clerk for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas, predicted
that Clinton's defenses would not bear fuller scrutiny. For
example, he said, the judge in the Jones case, Susan Webber Wright,
took great pains to make sure the president wasn't subjected to
unfair questions, and later sealed his deposition. Thus, Clinton's
explanation that he gave narrow answers out of a fear of leaks was
implausible, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Concluded Smith, ``Perjury laws would be useless if this kind of
hair-splitting could be justified.''

NATHAN LANE'S MODEST TV `ENCORE!' 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN CARMAN  
 c.1998, San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   He's laid out in his ``Pagliacci'' clown suit at an Italian
hospital, where a bad clam and bad doctoring have ended the
glittering career of opera star Joseph Panini (Nathan Lane).
</P>
<P>
   The doctors have managed to screw up his vocal cords. As a prima
donna, he's a gona. And that is how ``Encore! Encore!'' begins
Tuesday night on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   Now he'll have to crate himself and his ego home to the family
vineyard in Napa County and nurture his other sizable talent _
grandly afflicting all within his path.
</P>
<P>
   It's a nifty premise, backed by pedigreed personnel. Lane, the
glory of ``The Birdcage,'' is the star. Joan Plowright, a Tony
winner and Oscar nominee, plays his mother. Glenne Headly, whose
resume includes ``Lonesome Dove,'' plays his sister, who runs the
winery. And ``Encore! Encore!'' is from the producers who brought
us ``Frasier.'' Encore!
</P>
<P>
   So what a disappointment to find a sitcom that's modestly
entertaining at best, instead of a comedy gem that would make you
want to fling bouquets at the Sony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' spent its summer at TV medical spas _ a
script lift here, a cast tuck there _ and still doesn't seem
comfortable in its own skin. Most of the problems are with the
central character.
</P>
<P>
   Lane can digest more scenery before breakfast than most actors
consume in a lifetime. He can make Joseph Panini broad, somewhat
operatic and rogueish, but he can't make him charming and
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Lane was adorable in his most famous role, as the drag queen
performer and surrogate mother in ``The Birdcage,'' because under
all the fussbudget mannerisms, that character was lovably innocent.
</P>
<P>
   But while Joseph Panini has the same theatricality, he's also
monotonous, selfish and demanding. These are seldom the propellants
of a successful TV show. And, to be honest, Lane is not smashingly
convincing as the womanizer his character is supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   The show isn't an absolute dud. David Angell, Peter Casey and
David Lee could do a better series in a collective coma than most
TV producers could imagine on their best days. But ``Encore!
Encore!'' doesn't rate the second ``Encore!'' NBC gave it over the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   This, finally, for trivia lovers. It's Lane's second network
series. The first, also on NBC, was called ``One of the Boys'' and
survived for about two months in 1982. Its star was Mickey Rooney,
and a pre-``Saturday Night Live'' Dana Carvey played Lane's
roommate.
</P>
<P>
   ABC's ``Sports Night'' (Tuesday on ABC) is probably the wrong
vehicle for some genuine talent, beginning with series creator
Aaron Sorkin.
</P>
<P>
   Sorkin wrote the scripts for ``A Few Good Men,'' ``Malice'' and
``The American President.'' Here, his fellow executive producers
include Brian Grazer and Ron Howard. ``Sports Night'' has class.
</P>
<P>
   I liked the pilot better the second time I watched it, but its
mix of comedy and dramatic tension won't work for viewers who like
their TV genres straight. Remember the dramedy? The sports theme
might also pare down the prospective audience.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Krause (``Cybill'') and Josh Charles (``Dead Poets
Society'') co-star as the anchors of a late-night sports show that
is, in all but its fictional name, ESPN's ``SportsCenter.'' Robert
Guillaume is their acerbic executive producer, Felicity Huffman
their harried producer, and Sabrina Lloyd plays the associate
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sports Night'' never leaves its Manhattan studio setting
Tuesday and consequently feels a bit cramped in an episode about
Krause's character wavering from his duties in the wake of a
divorce.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't insist on deep laughs, and appreciate a scarcely
utilized laugh track, you might give ``Sports Night'' a chance. But
it just doesn't have that gleam that suggests hit.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does ``The Hughleys'' (Tuesday on ABC), the season's
second new series about a black family moving into a white suburban
bastion. Fox's ``Living in Captivity'' is the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hughleys'' is supposed to be based on the actual
experiences of its creator and star, stand-up comic D.L. Hughley.
One of his producing partners is comedian Chris Rock.
</P>
<P>
   In Tuesday's pilot, Darryl Hughley (Hughley) is fretting that
his move has put him, in the words of his best friend Milsap (John
Henton), ``on the slippery slope to losing your blackness.''
</P>
<P>
   The whole show is a string of trumped-up race jokes tied to that
theme. At a store, a black saleswoman advises Hughley not to use a
certain ballpoint pen because it contains black ink.
</P>
<P>
   Slim show. Long odds.

LETTERS REVEAL BITTERNESS BETWEEN STARR AND CLINTON'S LAWYERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ After spending more than a month in a fruitless
effort to get President Clinton to agree to testify voluntarily
before the federal grand jury, Robert Bittman, one of Kenneth
Starr's deputies, was fed up with what prosecutors had come to view
as stalling tactics by the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``We fully acknowledge that the president has immense and
weighty responsibilities,'' Bittman wrote on March 2 in a letter to
David Kendall, Clinton's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want in every way to take fully into account those grave
duties of state,'' he continued. ``Yet since this matter arose, the
president has _ with all respect _ found time to play golf, attend
basketball games and political fund-raisers, and enjoy a ski
vacation.''
</P>
<P>
   For months, the independent counsel's office and lawyers for
Clinton exchanged letters that provide a window into how the two
camps maneuvered warily around one another. At times their
exchanges, which were released Monday by the House Judiciary
Committee, were businesslike. But at many points they were
frustrated and angry, betraying a deep suspicion on the part of
each side about the motivations of the other.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to Bittman on March 18, Kendall said he and the
president had dealt in good faith with Starr's investigation for
four years. But since the investigation was widened to include the
president's relationship with Monica Lewinsky, Kendall said, the
situation had changed.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel's actions in the previous weeks, Kendall
said, ``lead me to believe that your investigation may not, in
fact, be an even-handed search for justice but rather may be, for
whatever reason, a campaign to embarrass and harass the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   The letters, written from February through August, covered a
range of issues, including the White House's assertion of executive
privilege, its complaints about leaks from Starr's office and the
independent counsel's request for a blood sample from Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   But on no issue did the two sides clash more heatedly than on
the question of whether and when Clinton would appear before the
grand jury. And the main combatants were Bittman and Kendall, who
had represented Clinton in the Whitewater investigation since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Between Jan. 28 and early March, Bittman invited Clinton six
times to tell the grand jury his story, citing the president's
public pledge to cooperate fully with the investigation, according
to the correspondence. In some cases Kendall did not reply, and in
others he cited Clinton's heavy workload as the reason the
president would not be able to appear.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation in Iraq continues to be dangerously volatile,
and this has demanded much of the president's time and attention,''
Kendall wrote on Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton was so busy, Kendall wrote, that his own legal team had
not had enough time to prepare him for a grand jury appearance.
Moreover, Kendall said, Clinton's lawyers had been forced to spend
much of their time dealing with ``prejudicial and false leaks of
information about your investigation'' that the White House was
blaming on Starr and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, lawyers for the White House and Clinton regularly cited
leaks as a reason why they were suspicious of Starr's motives. As
Starr pressed for Clinton's testimony, Kendall suggested, in a
letter on March 4, that the grand jury could learn all it needed to
know about Clinton's side of the story from his deposition in the
Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit. In that deposition, Clinton
denied having a sexual relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Bittman's mounting frustration showed through in a letter to
Kendall on March 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, now eight weeks into the investigation, your
claim that the president continues not to have time to prepare his
testimony about Ms. Lewinsky is increasingly difficult for us to
understand,'' Bittman wrote. ``We now question whether the
president ever intends to cooperate with this investigation, as
promised, and testify.''
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, Bittman again asked if Clinton would agree to appear
before the grand jury. ``Having tried and tried, I will now try
once again,'' he wrote to Kendall. ``Please give me a
straightforward yes or no answer to the following question: Will
the president ever agree to testify voluntarily about the matters
involving Ms. Lewinsky?''
</P>
<P>
   The president's lawyers, Kendall replied two weeks later, ``have
serious objections to the origin and conduct of your Lewinsky
investigation, and until they are satisfactorily addressed, we
cannot, as a matter of professional duty to our client, allow the
president to give you further testimony at the present time.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally in mid-July, Starr subpoenaed Clinton to appear before
the grand jury. After the White House then proposed that Clinton
voluntarily appear in September, Bittman suggested that the
independent counsel's office was suspicious of whether the White
House team was still stalling. Because the president had not
appeared voluntarily, ``we are currently not inclined to withdraw
the subpoena'' and negotiate a date, Bittman wrote on July 24.
</P>
<P>
   Starr eventually withdrew the subpoena, and Clinton testified on
Aug. 17, an appearance broadcast around the world Monday.

CLINTON TRIES TO MAINTAIN PRESIDENTIAL DECORUM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ With a morning speech to the United Nations and an
afternoon panel on the global economy, Bill Clinton struggled to
maintain some semblance of presidential decorum Monday in the face
of near-continuous broadcasting of his videotaped grand jury
testimony about his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Although the president made no mention of the testimony in
public appearances during the day, its release haunted his every
step, at times creating almost unbearably awkward juxtapositions.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton strode into UN headquarters for a speech on
international terrorism at about 10 a.m., television sets all over
the building were carrying a picture of him defending a claim his
lawyer had made in January that the president and Lewinsky were not
having sex. ``Well,'' Clinton told off-camera prosecutors,
``actually in the present tense that was an accurate statement.''
</P>
<P>
   As the president reached the crescendo of his UN speech, the
power of his words seemed blunted by double meaning. ``It is not
necessary that we agree on all the world's issues to have
confidence in each other,'' he told the UN General Assembly. ``It
is not even necessary that we understand every single difference
among us to have confidence in one another.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's surrealistic,' said Raghida Dergham, senior diplomatic
correspondent for Al Hayat, the leading daily newspaper in the Arab
world, who covered the UN session. ``It is hard for the world to
understand how Americans allow such embarrassing details to be
discussed in public.''
</P>
<P>
   Monday was Clinton's second visit to New York in as many weeks,
and his second sustained effort to shift public attention from sex
and impeachment threats to international events, especially the
global economic crisis. White House aides pronounced themselves
satisfied with the effort late Monday, but observers across the
political spectrum expressed doubts about the president's ability
to do much about the public's near O.J.-like obsession with the
Lewinksy scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``There used to be an adage in politics: `When in trouble,
travel,' '' said Karlyn K. Bowman, a fellow with the generally
conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington. ``Maybe
New York isn't far enough,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The White House sex scandal ``is sucking the oxygen out of any
other issue, and that's going to be a problem for Democrats in the
fall,'' said Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trying to focus on foreign policy is a plausible approach, but
it's a terrible mismatch today,'' added John Marttila, a Democratic
Party strategist from Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the uproar over the Lewinsky affair in recent weeks and
Clinton's videotaped testimony about it Monday, the public greeting
the president received here was comparatively mild.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of protesters carried placards reading ``Visualize
Impeachment'' and ``Get Your Pants Up and Get Out'' during a
morning protest at 42nd Street and Third Avenue near the UN and
they staged a second event in the afternoon outside New York
University Law School, where Clinton joined British Prime Minister
Tony Blair and others in a panel discussion about the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   But the protesters seemed about equally balanced with defenders,
among them, Sherri Adams, who carried a sign outside the afternoon
event that read ``Unwavering Support for the Clintons'' and
dismissed the charges against the president as ``not very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at both the UN and NYU gave the president unusually
warm receptions. As Clinton entered the General Assembly, Mexico's
Foreign Minister Rosario Green rose from her chair and led the
audience, which included South African President Nelson Mandela, in
a standing ovation. NYU Law School Dean John Sexton was almost
beside himself with adulation, calling Clinton's recent speech on
global issues ``sources of great inspiration.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind such kind words, however, there were signs of deep
nervousness Monday, especially among foreign officials.
</P>
<P>
   A senior UN official issued a statement after Clinton's speech
that appeared to warn both the president and his critics that a
United States preoccupied with the Lewinsky scandal could be a
danger for the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is widespread resentment among the UN membership
that the UN is being denied leadership by what is going on in
Washington,'' said John Ruggie, a senior adviser to the UN
Secretary General. ``There is a deep sense of anger about the US
squandering its potential leadership role ... at a time when the
world desperately needs leadership.''

$1.8 BILLION SOUGHT FOR SECURITY AT U.S. EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also TANZANIA-BOMBING) 
(js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration will ask Congress this
week for $1.8 billion for emergency security improvements at most
of the nation's 260 embassies and consulates worldwide, a
downpayment on protecting U.S. missions against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   That money, about twice the amount Congress has appropriated for
diplomatic security since 1985, reflects the administration's
conclusion that no country can be considered safe for U.S.
diplomats following the fatal bombings in East Africa last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the request remains far below the full amount the State
Department has said is needed to modify or build embassies meeting
the security standards established in the 1980s. In 1985, the
department put the cost of converting or replacing all embassies at
$3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the United Nations on Monday, President Clinton
spoke briefly of the new financing, saying that it would go ``to
repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the worldwide
fight against terrorism, to help our friends in Kenya and Tanzania
with the wounds they have suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $1.8-billion request, which the White House is expected
to send to Congress on Tuesday, about $200 million would go toward
building embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
to replace those demolished in the Aug. 7 bombings. Because the
construction could take two to three years, the money would also
finance temporary missions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, $1.2 billion was earmarked for emergency security
improvements in embassies worldwide, including additional security
guards, video cameras and other equipment to enhance security,
particularly around the perimeters of diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the money would go toward reimbursing the
Pentagon for its costs in dealing with the bombings in East Africa;
increasing Secret Service protection of traveling U.S. dignitaries;
providing new anti-terrorism programs in countries where the United
States has diplomatic missions; and giving disaster relief for
Kenya and Tanzania, including payments to families of those killed
in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep big bombs from entering inside our compounds
and embassies, we'll reduce the risk of catastrophic collapses of
buildings,'' said an administration diplomatic security official.
</P>
<P>
   But congressional aides said the proposed upgrades are likely to
fall short of the recommended security standards the State
Department set in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't barricade our way out of this new terrorist threat,''
said a senior House Republican aide. He said ``we need better and
timely intelligence'' on terrorists like those believed to be
associated with Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of
orchestrating the embassy bombings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The emergency spending request was based largely on reports by
diplomatic security experts at U.S. missions worldwide and by
counterterrorism experts dispatched by the administration to 30
embassies worldwide. Administration officials, speaking on
condition that they not be identified, described the spending
proposal to reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, White House and State Department officials have
negotiated with lawmakers over how much Congress would approve as
an emergency spending measure, and for what purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are expected to approve the request, which is about
half of what the administration had originally suggested. But
administration officials said Monday that after the first wave of
emergency improvements are made, other ongoing steps will be needed
to upgrade security in later appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Even with strong bipartisan support, discussion of how to
finance the new security measures could become entangled in a much
broader political brawl over how to spend the government's budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has argued that the new security measures
should be considered emergency spending. In reality, Clinton would
have to pay for the new measures by dipping into the budget
surplus. That would put him at odds with his pledge to save every
penny of the surplus to finance Social Security. It would also open
him to criticism from Republicans who want to use some of the
surplus for big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill vowed Monday to vote against the
embassy security measures unless they are paid for by cuts
elsewhere in the administration's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll certainly vote no, and will do everything in my power to
stop it,'' said Rep. Mark Neumann, R-Wis. and a member of the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. and head of the Conservative Action
Team, a group of about 45 House Republicans, said through a
spokesman that he supports the bolstered diplomatic security but
would oppose paying for it with the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials acknowledged Monday that the request
would pay for improvements that would ``significantly raise the
level of protection'' at most embassies worldwide, but that the
State Department will have to address long-term security issues in
its regular budget requests over the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department survey conducted after the East Africa
bombings found that about 220 of the 260 embassies and consulates
fall short of security standards and need improvements, an
administration official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Between 60 percent and 70 percent of all U.S. diplomatic
missions need to be a greater distance from busy streets or
sidewalks, the official added. The U.S. Embassy in London and the
U.S. consulate in Bombay were singled out as especially worrisome.
They are both located on busy thoroughfares and ``may need to be
relocated,'' the official said.

ABBEY INSTALLS STATUES OF FOREIGN MARTYRS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JENNY E. HELLER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Life-size statues of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King
Jr., Archbishop Oscar Arnulfo Romero and other 20th-century figures
who died for their beliefs now fill the 10 niches above Westminster
Abbey's main entrance that had remained empty for 500 years.
</P>
<P>
   The American civil rights leader, assassinated in Memphis,
Tenn., in 1968, is shown with outstretched palm turned up in
welcome and a girl crouching at his feet. To his left, Romero, the
liberal cleric who was gunned down in El Salvador in 1980 while
celebrating Mass, smiles serenely, his eyes almost closed behind
heavy-rimmed glasses. In his arms, he cradles a boy.
</P>
<P>
   The monuments, carved in French Richemont limestone, stand in a
row along a stone archway towering some 20 feet above visitors.
Nearly five years in the making, they were unveiled in mid-July.
</P>
<P>
   Since William the Conqueror's ascent in 1066, England has
crowned its kings and queens and often witnessed royal weddings and
funerals in Westminster Abbey, most recently last summer, when
Prince William and Prince Harry followed the coffin of their
mother, Diana, princess of Wales, through the doors above which the
new statues now stand.
</P>
<P>
   Installation of the new statues, intended to honor Christian
martyrs, marks the end of a 25-year renovation of the abbey, most
of which dates from the 14th century.
</P>
<P>
   Architects speculate that the niches were originally intended to
hold sculptures of England's monarchs and Westminster Abbey's
deans. Alterations to the abbey's west front, which had been
unchanged since the time of Henry VIII, provoked more discussion
than most other parts of the restoration and required the approval
of Queen Elizabeth II.
</P>
<P>
   In an abbey filled with plaques and monuments to illustrious
British royal figures, writers and politicians, the 10 figures are
the only 20th-century people represented by full-length statues.
The abbey librarian, Tony Trowles, said the figures were the
``first major statues'' to be installed since one of Prime Minister
William Gladstone was unveiled in 1903.
</P>
<P>
   There is nothing British about the new statues, the abbey's
first commemoration of people unrelated to England. ``They are
representative of the major areas of persecution and representative
of all continents in the world,'' said the Rev. Dr. Anthony Harvey,
the subdean of Westminster.
</P>
<P>
   The chief architect for the abbey, Donald Buttress, a proponent
of the new monuments, argued that the church was a piece of living
art that should evolve with the times rather than remaining a
shrine to the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gothic architecture has niches which are part of the design;
without them being filled, the architecture is incomplete,'' said
Buttress, whose official abbey title is surveyor of the fabric.
</P>
<P>
   The new figures stand in the facade between the abbey's twin
towers, designed by Sir Christopher Wren and built in the 18th
century. Each of the niches resembles an ornate throne: A length of
stone above bears royal insignia colored in the characteristic red
and gold of England's monarchy.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to King and Romero, there are statues of the Polish
priest Maksymilian Kolbe, who gave his life for another prisoner at
Auschwitz in 1941 and is a Roman Catholic saint; a South African,
Manche Masemola, who was killed in 1928 by her animist parents for
her Anglican faith on a site that has become a point of pilgrimage;
and a Ugandan Anglican evangelist, Janani Luwum, an archbishop of
Uganda who is believed to have been assassinated in 1976 by the
Ugandan army.
</P>
<P>
   Statues were also raised in memory of the Grand Duchess
Elizabeth of Russia, who was killed by the Bolsheviks and is a
saint in the Russian Orthodox Church; the German Lutheran
theologian Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was executed by the Nazis in
1945; Esther John (born Qamar Zia), the Indian teacher and
evangelist who was found brutally murdered in her bed at a mission
compound in 1960; Lucian Tapiedi, an evangelist of Papua New Guinea
who was killed by a villager when the Japanese invaded and incited
the murder of Christians in 1942, and Wang Zhimeng, who lived among
3,000 Chinese Christians in Yunnan province and was executed in
1973 during the Cultural Revolution's drive against religion.
</P>
<P>
   The 20th century, with its totalitarian regimes, mass executions
and many civil wars, has produced more Christian martyrs than any
other century, Harvey said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This says something of great import,'' he added, gesturing
toward a photograph of the facade in his study. ``In this century,
the profession of the Christian faith has carried a greater cause,
and that is continuing.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Church officials who sat on the committee to select the martyrs
said that placing the statues above the abbey's main entrance would
send a message to those around the world being persecuted for their
faith. Some choices were simple for the committee, Harvey said, but
for others it became necessary to consult local church authorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``These 10 statues are of individual martyrs; but they are
intended to represent all those others who have died (and continue
to die) in similar circumstances of oppression and persecution,''
Harvey wrote recently.
</P>
<P>
   None of the martyrs are given more prominence than others, and
the order of the statues is purely architectural. ``There is a
certain rhythm between them,'' Buttress said.
</P>
<P>
   The architects and the sculptors studied photographs and
pictures of the martyrs when possible and talked to surviving
relatives. There were no photographs of the South African martyr
Manche Masemola, but the carvers reconstructed her likeness from a
drawing.
</P>
<P>
   The architects could also find no descriptions of Lucian Tapiedi
of Papua New Guinea, so sculptors based his likeness on pictures of
typical people of the time and place. A team of four sculptors led
by Tim Crawley, who has been working on the abbey for a decade,
carved the figures.
</P>
<P>
   While the people depicted are modern in appearance and dress,
the statues blend with their Gothic surroundings. Only the color of
the new limestone against the weathered gray of the facade sets the
sculptures apart, and in decades to come it should become
indistinguishable.
</P>
<P>
   To accompany the martyrs, the abbey simultaneously filled two
niches on each side of the great doors of its main entrance with
Gothic-style statues of women representing truth, justice, mercy
and peace, virtues on which abbey officials say the martyrs based
their lives.
</P>
<P>
   The unveiling ceremony, conducted by the archbishop of
Canterbury, the Most Rev. George Carey, was attended by Queen
Elizabeth and by the families of most of the martyrs.

TANZANIA CHARGES TWO IN BOMBING OF AMERICAN EMBASSY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Tanzania charged two men on Monday with 11
counts of murder in connection with the bombing of the U.S. Embassy
there on Aug. 7.
</P>
<P>
   The action contrasted markedly to a decision by Kenya, where the
American Embassy was bombed on the same day. Kenya has sent two
suspects to the United States, where they have been indicted, and
diplomats suggested that the Tanzanian decision set up a potential
diplomatic conflict with the United States and might hamper the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   In Kenya, 236 Kenyans and 12 Americans were killed. Eleven
people died in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
   With three FBI agents in court on Monday in Dar es Salaam, the
Tanzanian capital, the government provided no details beyond the
defendants' names. But authorities in Kenya and diplomats said that
one man, Mustafa Mahmoud Said Ahmed, was interrogated in the fall
about terrorist activities in Kenya, including a plot to bomb the
American Embassy, and that he was wanted in Egypt for terrorist
activities.
</P>
<P>
   While living in Kenya from 1994 to last year, Ahmed's life
paralleled that of Wahid el Hage, who was indicted last week in New
York and has been accused of working with Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi-born financier whom the United States believes was behind the
embassy bombings.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed and el Hage, of Arlington, Texas, arrived here in 1994 and
went into gem trading. They were interrogated in the fall, el Hage
in the United States, shortly leaving Kenya, and Ahmed here.
</P>
<P>
   It is not publicly known what prompted the interrogations, in
which the two told of knowing bin Laden, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In his interrogation Ahmed provided details of a plot to attack
the American Embassy using three vehicles, said a report last month
in The Nation, a respected independent newspaper here. An American
diplomat said Monday that the threat had been dismissed as not
serious.
</P>
<P>
   In Tanzanian Magistrate's Court on Monday, Ahmed, an Egyptian,
and the other defendant, Rashid Saleh Hemed, a Tanzanian, did not
enter formal pleas. Ahmed told the court that he did not understand
how he could be charged because on the day of the bombings he was
in Arusha, 300 miles north of the capital, on the border with
Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   One defendant indicted in the United States in the bombings,
Mohamed Saddiq Odeh, has said an Egyptian named Mustafa had led the
Tanzanian operation. In a statement to authorities in Pakistan,
Odeh, who was caught returning from Kenya on a false passport, also
said he went to Kenya in 1994 on an invitation from Mustafa,
according to a Pakistani summary of the interrogation.
</P>
<P>
   In his interrogation by Kenyan officials in the fall, Ahmed said
that he had grown up and gone to primary school in Zaire, later
attending Al Azhar University in Cairo, where he received a degree
in agricultural engineering. He said he worked in Kuwait for the
Defense Ministry from 1980 until August 1990, when Iraq invaded
Kuwait. He returned to Zaire to set up a gem business and did
deals, he said, for Mobutu Sese Seko, the country's dictator, who
was overthrown last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed moved here in 1994 and set up a branch of his gem business
here, he told the police. He also told the police that he was well
acquainted with Islamic radicals and provided them with details
about a plot to blow up the American and Israeli Embassies. He said
that three vehicles would be used to attack the American embassy,
and that on Oct. 22, 1997, he and another man took pictures of both
embassies.
</P>
<P>
   The Kenyans passed that information to the embassy, information
that the American diplomat, who insisted on anonymity, said was
found not to be credible.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has a ``big criminal file'' on Ahmed, arising out of his
terrorist activities there, said an official in Tanzania, who
added, ``They have enough to bring him to trial in Egypt and in the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Egypt has not requested his extradition and is not very likely
to, preferring to leave the issue to the United States, a person in
the Egyptian Foreign Office said.
</P>
<P>
   The American Embassy in Tanzania declined to answer whether the
United States has or would request Ahmed's extradition. Two senior
diplomats accredited to Tanzania said they thought that Tanzania
would resist efforts to have Ahmed or Hemed extradited. Tanzania,
they noted, has long sought to assert its independence from the
United States and other world powers.

 &HT;    One woman's voice: Tarsha Butts
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ She worked hard for the attention.
</P>
<P>
   Tasha Butts,15, will be a junior guard this season at Baldwin
High School in Milledgeville, Ga., and plays in the Atlanta-based
Georgia Dream AAU program. She talks about her budding basketball
career:
</P>
<P>
   I was about 10 years old when my dad started making me go to the
recreation center near us to play basketball with the boys. I never
played with girls growing up, and I think that helped me. My
brother played high-school basketball, and he helped toughen me up.
He used to elbow me in the head. If I cried about it, he'd tell me
he didn't want me to be a punk.
</P>
<P>
   By the time I was 13, I was pretty good. I started getting
letters from colleges when I was in the eighth grade. I've gotten
letters and questionnaires from over 80 different schools. They
can't really talk to me yet, so they write stuff like, ``I saw you
play. You looked great.'' At first, I got real excited about it.
</P>
<P>
   Now I look at it and say, ``Well, it's only another letter.'' It
won't really become a big deal until I start thinking about making
a decision about where I want to go.
</P>
<P>
   I know there's a lot of coaches watching me, but I try not to
focus on it. If I just went out there and tried to impress them, I
wouldn't play my game, so I have to block them out. I like the
attention, but I feel like I worked hard to get here. So why not
get attention?
</P>
<P>
   I'm glad women now have a chance to play in the pros. At first,
I thought I would have no place to go after college, and I knew
there would be a slim chance to make the Olympic team. Now, I have
a chance to keep playing.

 &HT;    Women in sports: growing pains
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In search of volleyball talent, Louisville women's
coach Leonid Yelin returned to his homeland in the former Soviet
republic of Uzbek two years ago and brought back Marina Sinichenko.
</P>
<P>
   Problem was, Sinichenko lacked the necessary English language
skills for admittance to the university. So one of Yelin's
assistants funneled $2,000 from a volleyball camp account to a
local women's group, which in turn awarded Sinichenko a scholarship
for an ``English as a Second Language'' course the summer before
her enrollment. Coaches arranged for her transportation and
persuaded a local Russian Orthodox priest to provide lodging in his
home. Even her dental bill was paid.
</P>
<P>
   Yelin says he was just treating Sinichenko like family. That's a
defense made popular by men's coaches who also break NCAA rules,
and it held little sway with investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Any day, Louisville officials expect to get slapped with a stiff
penalty after appearing in August before the NCAA infractions
committee to answer the allegations. Hoping to lessen the blow, the
school suspended Yelin for a month without pay and canceled the
team's preseason exhibition series in Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Louisville's case is no longer an isolated one in women's
college athletics.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you see the competition rise dramatically, people are
always going to look for an edge,'' said athletics director Tom
Jurich, who was hired after the violations occurred.
</P>
<P>
   That justification long has been the tiger pit of big-time
athletics, which advocates of women's sports hope to bypass.
</P>
<P>
   But with lucrative contracts and shoe endorsement deals for
coaches ratcheting up the pressure to win, women's sports is
fighting its way through the traps that have snagged and embarrased
their male counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Including secondary violations, the more common form of
rules-breaking, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution review of NCAA
cases since 1992 reveals a nearly 300 percent jump for the women,
with 644 reported last year alone. If football is removed from the
equation, women's transgressions are virtually the same as those
for the men, who committed 655 violations in that period.
</P>
<P>
   ``The women's programs have grown in the same direction as the
men's programs in every other way, so I don't know why I would
think that would be different,'' said David Berst, NCAA chief of
staff for Division 1 and former executive director of enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   Berst partly attributes the rise in secondary cases to women's
sports coaches and administrators more dilligently reporting the
small stuff. But the gender ratio is similar for more serious
violations _ in which gifts and benefits are offered to athletes,
or coaches are deemed to have acted unethically.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the NCAA handed out penalties in nine cases of major
infractions. Three were solely men's athletic programs, three were
exclusively women's and three were a combination.
</P>
<P>
   The women have come a long, if unenviable, way from a decade
ago, when a single major violation was found. It was against the
Kenyon College women's swim team for practicing more than 100 miles
from campus.
</P>
<P>
   Not until around 1980 did coaches of women's college teams first
hit the recruiting trails in competitive pursuit of talent. Even
then, they generally stayed within a four-hour drive of campus.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with top programs fueled by bulging recruiting budgets,
coaches hustle coast to coast, dealing with their peers from high
schools, summer leagues and AAU programs, and even an occasional
street agent trying to broker a star player. For someone of WNBA
star Lisa Leslie's stature, the process begins when she's an
eighth-grader.
</P>
<P>
   It's a '90s phenomenon that has resulted in such established
basketball coaches as Andy Landers of Georgia and Pat Summitt of
Tennessee earning as much in base salary, if not more, than the
men's coach on their campus .
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just as much pressure on women to win as there is
men,'' said Marianne Stanley, coach at California-Berkeley. ``It's
very real. People are getting fired for not winning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaches have contacts with kids that they shouldn't have. I've
seen more minor than major (violations), sure. But do I believe
people are getting paid (to attend certain schools)? Yeah. I don't
think it's pervasive, but I believe it happens. Some people will
resort to unscrupulous means to accomplish whatever it is they feel
pressure to accomplish. ``
</P>
<P>
   Jody Conradt, Texas basketball coach and women's athletics
director, said, ``I don't think we're buying cars'' for players,
but she cited cases of schools or their boosters buying a prom
dress for prospects.
</P>
<P>
   When her Penn State team played in the women's basketball NIT in
March, Rene Portland said, she learned of another coach skirting
the rulebook by putting her team up for a weekend at her parents'
house on the New Jersey shore.
</P>
<P>
   Portland accuses schools or their supporters of paying for
parents' travel, another NCAA infraction. There are kids, . . . you
go to their homes (on recruiting visits), they don't have a
thing,'' she said. ``Then they (enroll at) another school, and
their parents are at games, and it's a long distance (from home).''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an (NCAA) recruiting rule that you can only call a kid
one time a week. Well, you're talking to a high-school athlete and
she says, 'I've talked to the coach of this college program the
last three nights.' ``
</P>
<P>
   One violation that has not knowingly occurred _ yet _ is a
player signing with a professional agent before her eligibility has
expired.
</P>
<P>
   Late in her sophomore year at Tennessee, the calls first came
for Chamique Holdsclaw, the premier basketball player in college.
It was the friend of a friend, a woman wanting to represent
Holdsclaw when she turned pro. When the woman followed Holdsclaw to
the national team tryouts last summer in Colorado Springs, Colo.,
Lady Vols assistant coach Mickie DeMoss flew there to shoo away the
aspiring agent.
</P>
<P>
   Tennessee might be the first program to screen agents, checking
to see if they are registered under the state's agent law and
clearing them to talk with seniors on the team. The first year,
they heard from three agents. This past season, it grew to 10.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the safeguards, hungry agents cannot always be warded
off.
</P>
<P>
   Vols star freshman Tamika Catchings was signing autographs for
young girls at the NCAA Final Four when a woman slipped her a
business card and said, ``Call me sometime.'''
</P>
<P>
   Head coach Pat Summitt, admittedly paranoid about agents, passed
the card on to a school administrator who wrote the woman a note to
explain that agents in Tennessee must register and meet
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to come across like this woman knew she was doing
something wrong,'' said Donna Thomas, the Volunteers' compliance
director. ``It's so new in the women's game, a lot of people may
not know the ins and outs of it yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Tamika's father, former NBA center Harvey Catchings, predicts
such incidents offer the first glimpse of the recruiting horrors
and agent dirty-dealings that have afflicted big-time men's sports
for two generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be that situation where you have that fish bowl
once again,'' said Catchings, who has another daughter playing at
Illinois. ``You're going to have your cream of the crop, the people
coaches look at and say, 'I want to build my team around this
particular person. So what is it going to take for you to come to
my school?' ``

 &HT;    Recruiting game seems like old times for Chones
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Dad takes it all in stride. A former NBA star, Jim
Chones is experienced in how college recruiters, sharks circling in
the waters, come after a highly rated prospect with low-post
skills. ``Don't let it go to your head,'' he cautions Kaayla, his
16-year-old daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Mom is new to the recruiting spiel, so her take on it is
different. She is amused by the flattery shown Kaayla. ``It might
be better to say who (BEGIN ITAL) hasn't (END ITAL) she heard
from,'' Elores Chones says, marveling at the college courtship.
</P>
<P>
   It's relentless. Since coaches could begin calling high-school
seniors-to-be in July, the telephone in their suburban Cleveland,
Ohio home has rarely stopped ringing. All the brand-name schools:
North Carolina, Duke, Penn State, Connecticut, Ohio State. ``Is
Kaayla there, please?'' they want to know.
</P>
<P>
   The birthday, Christmas and Valentine cards have flowed in
steadily since Kaayla's freshman season, filling a half-dozen
orange plastic crates. Michigan is the creative leader, having
already dubbed her Ms. Windex and addressing their letters to
Kaayla ``Rebound Queen'' Chones. The runover is stashed in the
bedroom of her older sister, Kareeda, a recent Marquette University
graduate and basketball team captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's at a point where we know the UPS and Federal Express guys
on a first-name basis,'' Elores says.
</P>
<P>
   It's a fine time to be one of the top school-girl basketball
recruits in the country, especially if you're a 6-foot-3 1/2 center
with the reach of a 6-8 player. You averaged 22.7 points and 19.5
rebounds while earning all-state honors and a 3.8 grade-point
average last year at Eastlake North High. Your father, who is
partial and knowledgeable, says you have the best hands on a
youngster he's ever seen, boy or girl.
</P>
<P>
   In ninth grade, you played on a state high-school championship
team. You made second-team all-state as a sophomore and first-team
last season. You have your pick of colleges, all free. You're a
ball girl for the new women's pro team in town, the Cleveland
Rockers. You jetted to Russia in July for the World Youth Games,
where you earned a bronze medal and were third on the U.S. team in
scoring and second in rebounds while sharing time with Cheryl Ford,
daughter of NBA star Karl Malone.
</P>
<P>
   You are living your mother's dream, and a lot of other women's
dreams. You finally can look up to role models of your own gender,
such as Lisa Leslie and Cynthia Cooper. They are women who
encourage you and promise that you, too, can be a pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just seeing them out there, playing in a professional league
in front of a crowd that big, it's inspired me to work harder,''
Kaayla said.
</P>
<P>
   ``My generation right now, we're right on schedule. With the
women's pro leagues starting the last two years, by the time I get
out of college, it'll just be booming. Almost like the NBA is. It's
just a great time to grow up.''
</P>
<P>
   Your father says you have (BEGIN ITAL) pro (END ITAL) written
all over you, and he should know. In a generation preceding teen
wonders Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant as famous NBA teens, there
was Jim Chones. He joined Spencer Haywood in the first wave of
players who turned pro before their 20th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Chones had lost his college eligibility when, during the 1972-73
season, he was leading Marquette to a No. 1 ranking and news
surfaced that an attorney representing him had engaged in
negotiations with the New Jersey Nets of the upstart American
Basketball League. With coach Al McGuire's blessing, the
19-year-old junior bolted for a five-year, $2.5 million contract.
The 6-foot-11 Chones played 11 seasons, bowing out with an NBA
title in Magic Johnson's rookie season with the Los Angeles Lakers.
In Chones' adolescence, a teenage girl didn't lift weights three or
four days a week during the off-season like Kaayla does now. She'd
have been called a freak, or worse. There was no opportunity to
hone one's game on the summer-league circuit, auditioning for
clipboard-carrying college coaches at events funded by shoe
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Elores Chores says, as best she can remember, Cleveland's John
Adams High didn't even have a girls' team when she was coming up in
early '70s . ``I would have loved the opportunity they have now,''
said Elores. At 5-9, she probably could have been a player. Jim
describes her as ``a great athlete,'' recalling she used to run him
into the ground while helping him get ready for training camp late
in his career.
</P>
<P>
   And here was their daughter in the eighth grade, the top player
on her Police Athletic League team, telling her father: ``Dad, I
want to be good.'' She tagged along as a go-fer at the Jim Chones
Basketball Camp, listening and learning, not far from the knee of
his former NBA cronies.
</P>
<P>
   One of them, Campy Russell, suggested incorporating the George
Mikan drills, repetitive techniques named after the NBA's first
standout big man, to improve her coordination and cut down on
missed layups.
</P>
<P>
   ''We have an easement right next to our house, and it's 60 yards
long,'' Chones said. ``I'd have her run 'suicides.' Up and down was
one. I'd have her run five of them. Then, I'd have her do more
'Mikans.' That's where she learned her touch around the basket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since then, she's incorporated a little Kevin McHale. She'll
step out, step back through and bank it off the glass. I just
showed her how to do it, but a lot of it was her initiative,
getting out there and working hard on her own. Everybody says, 'Oh,
she got it from her dad.' And she really didn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Although it was Dad's decision to switch her from a
``high-powered'' private-school program to a public school after
ninth grade, he acknowledges that Mom deserves more credit than he.
Jim is overseeing the rest of this mother lode of basketball talent
_ triplet 13-year-old sons Kendall (6'-4 1/2''), Kyle (6'-4'') and
Kameron (5'-10''). Elores, also Kaayla's best friend, takes her to
practice and travels to her games. She helps sort through the
recruiting letters. She enforces the long-established house rule:
Good grades or you don't play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm her biggest critic and biggest fan,'' said Elores,
a fixture in the stands above her daughter's team bench. ``We have
a system, and have had since she was a freshman. If she is not
rebounding, I have certain hand signals to let her know. It's two
thumbs up. Or if she's not being aggressive, there is a sign. I'll
cross my arms and lift them up. Or I'll point to my brain, and that
means focus more. Play smart.
</P>
<P>
   ``She knows them all right off the bat, and that helps get her
game together without everyone else knowing what I'm telling her to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   So it is a girl thing. With opportunity denied her, Elores
Chones stands watch over her daughter to ensure that Kaayla's shot
isn't missed.

 &HT;    Recruiting budgets: Nothing to huge
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The rental car heads west on I-20 toward Birmingham
carrying the head coach of the Georgia women's basketball team, a
bottle of Mountain Dew, two cheap cigars for chewin' and spittin'
and road money from a recruiting budget that has grown from zero to
$60,000, give or take a drive-through-window meal. A weekend in the
spring. Six hundred teenage girls on 48 teams playing 120 games on
six courts in two gymnasiums over 44 hours, not including a
midnight all-star game that has one punchy, bleary-eyed coach
cracking, ``These poor kids actually think we're watching them
right now.''
</P>
<P>
   And this was the (BEGIN ITAL)first (END ITAL) Deep South
Classic. Imagine when the tournament grows.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Landers can blame himself in part. Nineteen years ago, he
came to the Georgia athletics department, which consisted of a
football team and minor sports, and persuaded them not only to hire
its first full-time women's basketball coach but to fill the
position with a junior-college coach from some Tennessee outpost.
After Landers got the job, he tried importing a concept foreign to
women's basketball: recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let me tell you where things were,'' Landers said. ``When I
took the job, I called the coach at Lowndes County High School,
which at the time was in the midst of, like, a 160-game winning
streak. So the coach, Charles Cooper, answers the phone and I said,
`Hi, I'm Andy Landers, University of Georgia, and I'm interested in
a couple of your players.' He says, `Really? This is the first time
we've ever gotten a call from Georgia.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm thinking, `I got a problem.'''
</P>
<P>
   That autumn, Landers set out to build bridges with state
high-school coaches. He drove up to Dalton, down to Rome, through
Worth County, over to Lowndes, then hooked back north. He would
walk into a school and stay five minutes or an hour. (BEGIN ITAL)
Hi, I'm Andy Landers. Have any good players? Seen any good players?
(END ITAL) Then he returned home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two days later,'' Landers said, ``I'm in my office, and my
athletics director at the time, Liz Murphy, comes in and says, `I
got a call from another coach in the state who said you're
cheating.' I said, `I am?' Liz says, `Yeah, they said you're going
around talking to people. You can't do that.' I said, `Liz. That's
not cheating. That's called recruiting.'''

   Q. Are there any factory-outlet stores or other discount stores
in Italy that sell the wonderful silk fabric that can be made into
ties? _ Patricia Tracy, Blacksburg, Va.
</P>
<P>
   A. If you want printed silk to make neckties, the best place to
shop is in and around Como, about 30 miles north of Milan on the
southwestern tip of Lake Como, in the heart of the Italian silk
country. Trains depart hourly from Milan's central station, and the
trip takes about 35 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Many producers have outlets at or near the factory that sell to
the public at a discount. The city of Como also has numerous stores
that sell silk by the meter (a little more than a yard), but it
costs about 10 percent to 15 percent more at these stores.
</P>
<P>
   One silk factory with an outlet is Ratti, 19 Via Cernobbio, Como
22100, telephone (39-031) 233 111. Maureen Fallon, the personal
assistant to the president, said that factory outlets typically
sold remnants from the end of bolts of silk. She estimated that one
meter of silk, which is about a yard wide and would sell for about
$20 in the outlet store, would be enough to make four neckties.
</P>
<P>
   The store also sells scarves and neckties ith famous labels like
Versace. A Valentino scarf, she said, would cost about $60 at the
outlet.
</P>

   Q. I would like to explore the Intracoastal Waterway. Which
states does it pass through? Do you know of any cruises on the
waterway? _ Lee M. Spangler, San Francisco
</P>
<P>
   A. The Intracoastal Waterway consists of two main parts: the
Atlantic and Gulf intracoastal waterways. The former extends from
Boston to Key West, Fla.; the latter from Apalachee Bay, Fla., to
Brownsville, Texas In total, they provide a 2,500-mile network of
channels for barges and other light-draft vessels along the
Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, often following rivers, bays, coastal
sounds and canals.
</P>
<P>
   Because of the relatively shallow waters (as little as 12 feet
in some places), intracoastal cruises are on smaller ships, like
the American Canadian Caribbean Line's 100-passenger Grande Mariner
and Grande Caribe.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-day Intracoastal Waterway cruise travels from Warren, R.I.,
to Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. (or in the reverse direction, depending
on the date) with stops in Baltimore; Norfolk, Va.; Belhaven,
Beaufort and Southport, N.C.; Georgetown and Charleston, S.C.;
Savannah and St. Simons Island, Ga.; and St. Augustine, Titusville
and Hobe Sound, Fla. Southbound departures are Oct. 30 and Nov. 1
this year and May 26, Oct. 31 and Nov. 7 next year; northbound
April 25, May 9 and June 12 next year.
</P>
<P>
   Rates are $2,255 to $2,795 a person, double occupancy, depending
on the cabin. Air fare and sightseeing excursions are extra.
Contact American Canadian Caribbean, 461 Water Street, Post Office
Box 368, Warren, R.I. 02885; (800) 556-7450, fax (401) 247-2350;
www.accl-smallships.com.
</P>
<P>
   Clipper Cruise Line, 7711 Bonhomme Avenue, St. Louis, Mo. 53105;
(800) 325-0010 (on the Web: www.clippercruise.com), also offers
cruises on the waterway on its 100-passenger Nantucket Clipper and
122-passenger Clipper Adventurer. The Nantucket Clipper has
eight-day Antebellum South cruises Oct. 31 and Nov. 7, 14 and 21
this year and March 6, 13, 20 and 27 and April 3 and 10 next year.
</P>
<P>
   The ships travel one way between Jacksonville, Fla., and
Charleston, S.C., with stops in St. Marys, St. Simons Island,
Savannah and Beaufort. Rates, per person double occupancy, are
$1,950 to $3,495. Air fare is extra.
</P>
<P>
   A 15-day Colonial America and Civil War Battlefields cruise Apr.
17, 1999, goes from Jacksonville to Baltimore, with stops including
New Bern, N.C., and Norfolk. Rates: $3,800 to $6,560.
</P>
<P>
   The Nantucket Clipper also has a 15-day cruise including the
Chesapeake Bay and New England ports departing May 15 ($3,900 to
$6,990).
</P>
<P>
   But the grand tour of the Intracoastal Waterway is a 22-day trip
from Halifax, Nova Scotia, to Port Everglades, Fla., departing
Sept. 2, 1999, on the Clipper Adventurer. The tour, known as the
Great North American Odyssey, costs $6,920 to $11,200 a person,
double occupancy. &QL;

   Q. We will be in Melbourne sometime in January and we would like
to know what's on the schedule for various performing-arts centers
and companies, including the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, the Australian
Ballet and the Melbourne Concert Hall. Can you help us? _ William
E. Claypool, Steilacoom, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   A. First, the bad news: The dancers for the Australian Ballet,
telephone (61-3) 9684-8600, will be returning from their holiday
break about that time and will be in rehearsal for ``Don Quixote,''
which begins Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   But there will be a busy schedule at other performing-arts spots
around the city. At the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, 21 Linithgow
Avenue, (61-3) 9281-8360, there will be an Australia Day concert on
Jan. 26, although details have not yet been set.
</P>
<P>
   Australia Day is comparable to Independence Day here, and the
music bowl typically holds a concert with prominent Australian
performers (last year's stars were a rock group). Seating is
outdoors, with 2,000 permanent seats and room for 11,000 more
people on its lawn. You'll be there during the Southern Hemisphere
summer, a good time for alfresco music. Best of all, admission to
the Australia Day concert will probably be free.
</P>
<P>
   At the Melbourne Concert Hall, part of the Victorian Arts
Center, 100 St. Kilda Road, the Scottish comedian Billy Connolly,
who was the co-star with Judi Dench of the 1997 movie ``Mrs.
Brown,'' will be performing his stand-up routine on Jan. 18 to 20,
22 to 28, and 30 and 31. Call (61-3) 9281-8000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Comedy Tonight'' seems to be the theme at the arts center. ``A
Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum'' will be playing at
the State Theater, another part of the center complex, Jan. 1 to
Feb. 7. Call for times and ticket prices. Rounding out the arts
center's schedule, the Playhouse will feature ``Master Class'' from
Jan. 4 to 30.
</P>
<P>
   You can book tickets for the Victorian Arts Centre in the United
States through ATS Tours at (800) 423-2880, fax (310) 643-0032. Or
you can call directly at (61-3) 9281-8000, fax (61-3) 9281-8381, or
try www.artscentre.net.au.

 &HT;    Shock for cynical era
 &HT;    By Mark Bradley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   At the exact moment when it seemed that nothing else could
possibly come as a shock, as CNN was airing the leader of the free
world's taped quibbling over the meaning of the word ``is,'' a
bulletin flashed onscreen, a bulletin that caused even this most
jaded of jaws to drop:
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence Griffith Joyner dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost exactly 10 years after her golden Olympiad, the greatest
female athlete of the age died in her sleep. Her heart stopped
beating. She was 38. In any form, death tends to make little sense.
This made none.
</P>
<P>
   Sleek and elegant sprinters aren't supposed to die, not at 38.
The heart that makes a runner invincible isn't supposed to stop
arbitrarily. Whenever a great athlete dies, at any age under any
circumstances, it slaps those who live on unusually hard, offering
the grim reminder that conspicuous health carries no guarantee,
that each life has its own unknowable expiration date. But FloJo?
The utter essence of grace and vitality? Gone not 10 years after
Seoul? Just what kind of world is this?
</P>
<P>
   We Americans tend to ignore track and field except when shining
superiority demands that we look. FloJo made us look. In 1988, she
was the pre-eminent athlete on the planet, an extravagantly garbed
joy at a time when it was revealed that the world's fastest man was
a cheat. Ben Johnson had steroid-discolored eyes. FloJo had
one-legged unitards and abundant fingernails. Johnson left Seoul a
disgrace. FloJo came home the Queen of the World.
</P>
<P>
   That was 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's 1998 and she's dead.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe an autopsy will help sort out the unfathomable. Probably
not. Joyner had what now seems a similar seizure two years ago, but
that didn't really register with the masses. And it wasn't as if
she appeared old and infirm. On the contrary, we could still view
her in upscale magazines, lending her upper lip to those milk
promos.
</P>
<P>
   The records she set in the 100 and 200 still stand. At the 1988
Olympic trials, she cut .27 seconds off the existing mark, a
slashing of exponential proportion. Joyner's time was 10.49. No
woman has since run even a 10.6. In a Pentium II age in which
everything runs faster, nobody has yet outrun FloJo.
</P>
<P>
   Because she was so dominant in such a catty sport, FloJo had to
deny that her speed was drug-enhanced. It was easy to believe her,
for hers was such a sunny story. Born and raised in L.A., she
graduated from UCLA and won a silver medal at the 1984 Games in her
hometown. Two years later, substantially over her running weight,
she was working at a bank and braiding hair on the side. Then she
married Al Joyner, himself an Olympian, and resumed serious
training. Her coach was Bobby Kersee, husband of the great
heptathlete Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Al's brother-in-law.
</P>
<P>
   They were the First Family of American sport, elating in one
another's triumphs. JJK was practical, FloJo exotic yet demure.
Together they graced the cover of Sports Illustrated in 1988, five
Olympic golds between them. In 1996, Joyner-Kersee took bronze in
the long jump at what is now Turner Field. Today her sister-in-law
is dead. What kind of world is this?

 &HT;    Flo Jo had `a certain flair'
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With her colorful bodysuits and and six-inch decorated
fingernails, Florence Griffith Joyner made it fashionable to look
good and run fast. Other female athletes have come along to fill
the glamor role, but no one has matched the breathtaking speed of
the woman known as Flo Jo, who grabbed three gold medals while
turning the 1988 Seoul Olympics into a personal showcase.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after her heroics, the world's greatest female sprinter
was found dead Monday of an apparent heart seizure at her home in
Mission Viejo, Calif. She was 38.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County, Calif. sheriff's office said it received a
911 call early Monday from her husband, former Olympic triple
jumper Al Joyner, who reported his wife was ``unresponsive and not
breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had passed away during the night,'' spokesman Lt. Hector
Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy is scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Griffith Joyner suffered a heart seizure during a
flight. Still, news of her death was met with shock and disbelief
within the sport's community, which three years ago witnessed her
induction into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame during
ceremonies in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that Florence Griffith Joyner had had some heart
problems in recent months, but didn't think that it was anything
really serious,'' said Primo Nebiolo, head of the international
track federation. ``I will never forget this extraordinary athlete
who stunned the world in Seoul. . . . Sadly, her life has passed as
rapidly as her races.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, Griffith Joyner, raised in the Watts section of Los
Angeles, captured the 100-meter gold medal in a wind-aided 10.54
seconds and later shattered the world 200 record in the Olympic
final, clocking 21.34. At the Olympic Trials two months earlier,
she had crossed the 100 finish line in 10.49, wiping out Evelyn
Ashford's world record of 10.76.
</P>
<P>
   Not until this summer, with the emergence of Marion Jones, has
either record been seriously challenged.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a certain flair, a flamboyance the rest of us didn't
have with the fingernails, the hair, the outfits,'' Ashford said.
``She attracted people to the sport who probably wouldn't otherwise
watch a track meet.'' ``Understand, track had long been a
male-dominated sport, and with style and grace she showed you can
be a female and compete,'' said Sandra Farmer-Patrick, a former
Olympic hurdler. ``She used to say, `You can look beautiful, feel
beautiful and compete beautiful.'''

JAPANESE BANK COMPROMISE FRAYS ALREADY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SHERYL WuDUNN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ A broad-based banking compromise measure that Prime
Minister Keizo Obuchi had hailed as the foundation for Japan's
economic recovery began to fray Monday, just as Obuchi prepared to
meet with President Clinton in the United States on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The banking deal, which Obuchi had pursued intensely in advance
of his meeting with Clinton, at the Rockefeller estate near
Tarrytown, N.Y., had been many weeks in the making. It was intended
to help stabilize Japan's shaky financial system and to be the
basis for legislation to restore international confidence in the
nation's economy.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese markets reacted to the development negatively. Stocks
fell sharply here Monday, with the benchmark Nikkei index of 225
issues dropping by 385.82 points, or 2.76 percent, to 13,597.30, a
12{-year low. The exchange value of the yen declined against the
dollar.
</P>
<P>
   Also Monday, a major bond-rating agency, Fitch IBCA of London,
lowered Japan's long-term foreign currency debt rating from AAA to
AA plus. It said that with the nation's deteriorating banking
system, increasing government debt and slow response by
policy-makers, the risks of lending to Japan by overseas investors
could no longer be ignored.
</P>
<P>
   The banking agreement was supposed to forge a sweeping plan that
ranged from a framework for rescuing Japan's very large, very weak
banks to a sharp reduction in the power of the Finance Ministry,
which had been the nation's most influential bureaucracy.
</P>
<P>
   The central dispute Monday concerned whether an old fund to
rescue weak banks _ which Obuchi promised to dissolve _ would still
be used. Since the government had agreed to abandon old financing
devices, many people had assumed this would not be used.
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi's aides now say that they may use the old system
anyway because it is necessary to prevent a disruption in the
banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The current scheme will be effective until a new scheme is
formed,'' the top government spokesman, Hiromu Nonaka, said. ``The
government will need to cope without disturbances.''
</P>
<P>
   Another top official, Yoshiro Mori, general secretary of the
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, suggested over the weekend that
the old system could be used to assist the Long-Term Credit Bank of
Japan, which is floundering and may need assistance in the coming
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the government appeared to backtrack from the agreement,
opposition leaders warned that the entire accord might be scrapped.
</P>
<P>
   The leader of the main opposition Democratic Party, Naoto Kan,
objected on Sunday to the government's interpretation. In
particular, he rejected the idea of using tax money to bail out the
Long-Term Credit Bank under the current setup. Kan was reported in
the Japanese news media to have said that he was braced for the
collapse of the compromise.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreements will have to be resolved when Prime Minister
Obuchi returns to Tokyo from the United States. And the opposition
groups do not seem to be in a mood to give in and allow the use of
public funds to help the Long-Term Credit Bank.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``That constitutes a clear violation of our agreement,'' said
Motohisa Ikeda, a member of Parliament who was chief negotiator of
the agreement for the Democratic Party, in an interview Monday.
Asked whether it was possible that the agreement would totally
unravel, he replied, ``I cannot exclude the possibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Liberal Democrats and banking officials have suggested that the
Long-Term Credit Bank could face a severe upheaval toward the end
of this month, when the bank settles its half-year accounts.
Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's largest-circulation daily, carried a
report containing charges that the bank had covered up huge amounts
of bad debt. The bank, denying this, said there had been no
cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Comments by Mori, the governing party's secretary-general, also
suggested that the Liberal Democrats might be backtracking on the
issue of stripping financial regulatory power from the Finance
Ministry.
</P>
<P>
   But Ikeda, the opposition legislator, said it was more likely
that the Liberal Democrats would go back to the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   But the heated exchanges underlined the confusion over the
agreement, which was marked by the kind of ambiguity that led one
Democratic Party official to describe Friday's deal as ``tamamushi
iro'' _ the color of a Japanese insect that seems different
depending on the angle from which it is seen.
</P>
<P>
   Party politicians on both sides of the argument acknowledged
that a great number of details needed to be ironed out.

BRUINS REPORT LITTLE MOVEMENT   ON OFFERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NANCY L. MARRAPESE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ President/general manager Harry Sinden thought at the
end of last week that free agent defenseman Kyle McLaren was close
to being back in the fold. However, as of Monday afternoon, Sinden
had heard nothing from McLaren's representative, Doug Messier. The
club had pitched a one-year proposal to the young blue liner, who
is not eligible for arbitration for two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Messier) was supposed to call Friday but he didn't,'' said
Sinden. ``I thought we were rather close to doing a one-year deal.
I was kind of hopeful. We were more receptive to a one-year deal
with him because if he has a good year again, we can talk about a
long-term deal. When we last talked, (Messier) didn't indicate he'd
take my offer but he said to let him talk to Kyle.''
</P>
<P>
   As for free agents Jason Allison and Anson Carter, Sinden said
assistant GM Mike O'Connell was awaiting word from Bob Gerow,
Allison's representative, while the Carter situation was pretty
well dead in the water as the sides remain far apart.
</P>
<P>
   O'Connell said he amended the team's offer to Allison. While the
length remained the same (one year with a club option for a
second), the Bruins added performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   With regard to Ted Donato, Sinden had yet to hear from him or
his agent, Mark Witkin. Donato has requested a trade and the Bruins
are trying to accommodate him, but so far there are no takers.
Donato and Witkin sent a memo out across the league, with the
Bruins' blessing, to let teams know how much it would cost to sign
him if they were to deal for his rights. It hasn't had the desired
effect of greasing the skids for a deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason is that all the teams are wondering if they
should take on an extra contract until they see what they've got,''
said Sinden.
</P>
<P>
   It would make more sense for Donato to be in camp, working out
and playing in exhibition games so other clubs can take a look at
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've advanced those same thoughts,'' said Sinden. ``But they
haven't budged.''
</P>
<P>
   Donato seems to feel he has a better chance of being traded by
sitting out so that he wouldn't be used by the Bruins as an
insurance policy for Allison and Carter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's discouraging when young players are not at training
camp,'' Sinden said. ``It doesn't take long until their whole game
gets off track.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the three players in contract disputes _ Donato's
holdout isn't financially motivated _ has arbitration rights. But
according to Sinden, they want to be paid as if they do.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're saying, `If we had arbitration, we'd kick the hell out
of you but since we don't, we want you to kick the hell out of
yourself,''' he said. ``They want us to act as if we'd be a
generous arbitrator.''

 Taliesin West Offers Special Look at Wright  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The documentarian Ken Burns, whose PBS series have dissected
topics as all-American as baseball and the Civil War, will now
tackle another native subject: Frank Lloyd Wright, whom Burns calls
America's greatest architect.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour biography is to be shown in two parts on PBS on
Nov. 10 and 11, and in conjunction with it, Taliesin West _ the
architect's winter home, studio and architectural campus in
Scottsdale, Ariz., from 1937 until his death in 1959 _ will present
four days of events from Oct. 8 to 11.
</P>
<P>
   The centerpiece of the four days, ``Celebrate the Legacy,'' will
be a dinner with Burns and Lynn Novick, co-producers of the
documentary, and a preview screening of a shortened version of the
program.
</P>
<P>
   Taliesin West, a National Historic Landmark in the foothills of
the McDowell Mountains, is the site of the Frank Lloyd Wright
Foundation, Archives and School of Architecture. Participants will
be able to talk with former Wright associates, view the
``shelters'' designed by apprentices to house themselves, and visit
several Wright buildings in the Phoenix area, including the Price
House, First Christian Church, the David Lloyd Wright house and
Grady Gammage Memorial Auditorium at Arizona State University, and
explore the compound.
</P>
<P>
   Featured speakers include David Elgin Dodge, a faculty member of
the Frank Lloyd Wright School of Architecture, who will discuss
Wright's influence on the Arizona Biltmore Hotel in Phoenix; Bruce

   The world's most famous killer whale may be gone, but Newport,
Ore., hopes tourists will keep coming.
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 9, Newport, a town of 9,700 on the central Oregon coast
about 95 miles from Portland, bade farewell to Keiko, the
10,000-pound star of the ``Free Willy'' movies, when he was flown
to Iceland, the site of his capture in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   While he resided at the Oregon Coast Aquarium in Newport _ after
his removal from a cramped, overheated tank in a Mexico City
amusement park _ the black and white orca boosted tourism in
Newport, which has a quaint waterfront and nearby beaches. Keiko
was brought there in 1996 with the hope that he would learn to
survive in the wild.
</P>
<P>
   While Keiko is gone, Newport has a new coastal interpretive
center at the lighthouse, and the recently renovated Hatfield
Marine Science Center of Oregon State University; call (541)
867-0100 for information. Construction continues on an oceanfront
hotel, while the aquarium itself plans to convert Keiko's
2.1-million-gallon tank into shallow- and deep-ocean habitats
through which visitors would walk in a clear tunnel.
</P>
<P>
   The aquarium is open daily. Admission is $8.75, $7.75 for those
65 and older, and $4.50 ages 4 to 13. Information: (541) 867-3474.
</P>
<P>
   Keiko's new Icelandic home is a large pen in a bay just off the
Westmann Islands, a popular summer destination for Reykjavik
residents, about four hours by ferry or 20 minutes by plane from
the city.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors may get lucky and see Keiko through binoculars from a
600-foot cliff, but it is not likely, according to the Save
Willy-Keiko Foundation, the entity that will decide whether the
orca can be set free. Bob Ratliffe, the executive vice president of
the foundation, said it was highly questionable whether Keiko can
be released. Information on Keiko is available on the Web at
www.keiko.org.

 &UR; In Hartford, Landscapes From Two New Worlds &LR;  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Two hundred years ago, as the new United States and the new
British colony in Australia confronted their vast wildernesses,
expanses never imagined in their mother country, what kind of
landscape art did they produce? How was it similar, how different?
``New Worlds From Old: 19th-Century Australian and American
Landscapes,'' which opened at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford
this month, offers some answers.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition brings together about 120 Australian and American
landscapes from the 1800s. They are drawn from 32 American museums,
11 in Australia and 2 in Europe. They include paintings by Frederic
Church, William Merritt Chase, Winslow Homer and 34 other
Americans, as well as 23 Australian artists.
</P>
<P>
   The exhibition was co-organized by and first shown last spring
at the National Gallery of Australia in Canberra. It then traveled
to the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne. The exhibition
continues at the Atheneum until Jan. 3. Its final stop will be at
the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington, from Jan. 26 through
Apr. 18.
</P>
<P>
   In conjunction with the exhibition, the Atheneum has planned a
symposium, ``Crosscurrents: Fresh Perspectives on 19th-Century `New
World' Landscape Painting.'' Robert Hughes, the Time magazine art
critic and an Australian, will give the keynote lecture at 5 p.m.
on Oct. 23 at The Bushnell, a theater at 166 Capitol Avenue,
Hartford; tickets are $25 from the Bushnell's box office, (860)
246-6807. The symposium continues on Oct. 24 at the Atheneum.
</P>
<P>
   The Wadsworth, at 600 Main Street, is open Tuesday through
Sunday. Admission, with a $2 surcharge for this show, is $9, $8 for
ages 60 and up and college students, and $5 ages 6 to 17.
Information: (860) 278-2670.

   Beginning in November, the 56-passenger Monet will offer 22
seven-night cruises in the Persian Gulf out of Dubai in the United
Arab Emirates, with 11 including a call at Bandar Abbas in Iran, an
ancient maritime center on the Strait of Hormuz with antique
monuments and fortress ruins. Other ports of call include Muscat,
Oman; Manama, Bahrain, and Abu Dhabi and Sharjah in the United Arab
Emirates.
</P>
<P>
   While the cruise is a sign of Iran's new openness, the State
Department still warns Americans to defer travel there. It says
there is ``evidence that hostility to the United States remains in
some segments'' of the population and government.
</P>
<P>
   The rebuilt Monet offers staterooms with color TV, videocassette
recorders, hair dryers and telephones, and all have outside views.

   In a case of East goes West, Amanresorts, the Hong Kong-based
chain of elegant retreats, is opening its first American resort, in
Jackson Hole, Wyo., on Thursday. And like many elements of the
company, the resort's name, Amangani, is a cultural mix _ ``Aman''
is Sanskrit for ``peaceful'' and ``gani'' is Shoshone for ``home.''
</P>
<P>
   This peaceful home out West is anything but a simple frontier
ranch, though. Amangani offers 40 suites of sandstone, cedar and
redwood, built into the side of East Gros Ventre Butte, 7,000 feet
above sea level, with the town of Jackson below and the Grand
Tetons stretching to the north. Each suite comes with a mini-bar,
CD player, television with VCR, data lines for computers, sunken
tub, and terrace or deck with mountain or valley views.
</P>
<P>
   The resort's centerpiece, set on the 1,000-acre Spring Creek
Ranch, is a three-story building whose central area includes a
library, lounge, bar, restaurant and fitness center.
</P>
<P>
   There are two wings of suites stretching along the butte. Guests
have the use of a 115-foot heated outdoor pool, two tennis courts,
stables and cross-country skiing trails on the property. Among the
activities available nearby are golf, hunting, fly-fishing, rafting
and, of course, alpine skiing (about 25 minutes by car).
</P>
<P>
   Nightly rates till Dec. 19 are $400 to $600 plus tax, then $450
to $750. Reservations: (877) 734-7333, fax (307) 734-7332.

 &HT;    DOCUMENTS OFFER A WEALTH OF SCANDAL TRIVIA
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE and ANDREW MOLLISON
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Thousands of new details, ranging from the
salacious to the hilarious, emerged Monday from the 3,183 pages of
documents released from Independent Counsel Kenneth Star's
investigation:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Starr hired a professional appraiser to establish the ``fair
market value'' of gifts to Lewinsky from the president. They
included a sculpture depicting ``Spirit of the Grizzly Bear,''
$200; a coverlet depicting the ``Radio City Music Hall Christmas
Special'' starring the Rockettes, $50; a White House paperweight,
$10; a hat pin, $3; a gold-plated brooch, $5, and a silver-plated
brooch, $3.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  In March 1997, after Clinton injured his knee on a visit to
Florida, Lewinsky sent him a ``care package'' including a ``Hi ya
handsome!'' card, a license plate with ``BILL'' for his wheelchair
and kneepads with the presidential seal.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Vox,'' the Nicholson Baker novel about phone sex that she
gave to him, was listed on the inventory of the library in the
White House study between Frederick Talbott's ``Churchill on
Courage,'' and ``UFO Crash at Roswell'' by Kevin D. Randle and
Donald R. Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Linda Tripp, who taped telephone conversations in which her
co-worker Lewinsky described sexual escapades with Clinton, kept
the filled tapes haphazardly stored in a bowl in her Maryland
suburban home. Those tapes are now the object of a Starr inquiry
because nine of them were found to be duplicates, not originals.
</P>
<P>
   The documents state that ``if Ms. Tripp duplicated any tapes
herself or knew of their duplication, then she has lied under oath
before the grand jury and in a deposition.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  After Lewinsky placed an anonymous Valentine's Day classified
ad with a quote from ``Romeo and Juliet'' in the Washington Post of
Feb. 14, 1997, Tripp e-mailed her that ``It read beautifully,
placement was great, typeface totally effective and text
superlative. ... good job.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lewinsky's computer e-mail messages indicate that she was not
paralyzed by grief after Clinton broke off their relationship in
the spring of 1997. In early summer, she wrote of a brief affair
with a nutritionist at a spa in Connecticut, although she wrote
that they avoided each other on her second trip to the spa.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Writing in early August 1997 about an encounter with another
man, she wrote, ``I am sooooooo naughty. It was fun and good. I
went over there with some ice cream and pretty much seduced him in
a way that made him make the moves on me ... cool or what????''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Monica Lewinsky's feelings for President Clinton cooled
considerably after she watched his address to the nation on Monday,
Aug. 17, in which he acknowledged a relationship that was
inappropriate but did not mention her.
</P>
<P>
   Asked in her grand jury testimony whether she still loved the
president, Lewinsky said, ``It was very painful for me to watch his
speech on Monday night. It's hard for me to feel that he has
characterized this relationship as a service contract and that
that's all this relationship was. And it was a lot more than that
to me ...''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Lewinsky gave the president some ``gummy boobs'' candy from
Urban Outfitters at their last meeting on Dec. 28, 1997, during
which she was given a ``Christmas kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Inventories included in the records showed that Lewinsky kept
her size-10 blue dress from the Gap on a hanger in a plastic
cleaner's bag. On why she failed to clean it after it was stained
with semen during a session with Clinton, she explained: ``I gained
weight so I couldn't wear the dress and it didn't fit. And I'm not
a very organized person. I don't clean my clothes until I'm going
to wear them again.''

SOME NEW MAPS WORTH UNFOLDING  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, SEPT. 27) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BETSY WADE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Much has been made lately of mapping features on the Web. They
have their advantages, including the ability to customize the
cartography. But I've found that maps taken from the Web do not
help me much on the road unless they are printed on a color
printer, and even then, they are pretty dinky at 8{ by 11.
</P>
<P>
   So, as a map-dependent, I continue to linger by the racks in
bookstores, comparing legibility and manageability _ how the map
folds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is usually hard to be sure how well a map will work
until you get where you're going and see if it omits minor streets,
has a crease or staple through an address or, worst of all, ends
short of the destination. For years, central London maps expired
south of Islington.
</P>
<P>
   Some new map formats, and new approaches to navigation, are
appearing these days. Here are a few.
</P>
<P>
   Michelin has moved briskly on city streets. One series of these
close-ups is mapped and packaged for walkers rather than the
drivers who were the tire company's original impetus for going into
publishing. The maps are detailed and legible, which means large,
but the folding system makes them useful out of doors.
</P>
<P>
   The scales range from 1:10,000 (Rome and Lyons) to 1:17,500
(Brussels). A scale of 1:12,000 means that 3{ inches covers
three-fifths of a mile, and street names can be read with the naked
eye. All the maps are 39 by 52 inches, folded into 13 panels that
turn like a book's pages, with nothing printed on the back.
</P>
<P>
   A booklet inside the front cover provides an index to streets.
With the cover shut, the map is 9} by 4}, but still storable in a
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   The prototype for the blue-covered book-fold street maps was
Paris No. 12, as it is marked on the cover. It has been a steady
seller since it came out in 1982, according to Eileen Osteen of the
company's marketing department. Barcelona (No. 41) was next, for
the 1992 Summer Olympics. This spring brought Lisbon (39) for the
World's Fair and Madrid (42) in addition to Brussels (44), Lyons
(31) and Rome (38). Amsterdam (36) is due by December. These
usually cost $12.95. Information: (800) 223-0987.
</P>
<P>
   Streetwise Maps in Amagansett, N.Y., noted as a publisher of
``one-handed'' folding laminated maps for walkers, has expanded its
definition of ``street'' to cover states and regions _ New Jersey
and New England, for example. Its first such map for Europe was
published this year: Streetwise Tuscany. It is 36 by 8{ inches,
with half of the province on each side, on a scale of six miles to
the inch.
</P>
<P>
   It may be more for trip planning than for on-the-road
navigating, but this map would have helped in driving there because
it is in relief, and hills are a big factor in elapsed time in
Tuscany. It also shows railroad routes. Streetwise Tuscany costs
$6.95. Streetwise Maps: (800) 497-1314.
</P>
<P>
   Most bookstores _ including the Complete Traveller, 199 Madison
Avenue at 35th Street; (212) 685-9007 _ carry this series. This
store, incidentally, sells old maps along with its antiquarian
travel books.
</P>
<P>
   Stephan Van Dam, a New York map publisher who describes himself
as an ``information architect,'' is the creator of small
origami-like maps for 80 cities on the model of his most familiar,
New York Unfolds. Now he has published a pocket city atlas:
NY(AT)tlas.
</P>
<P>
   This is a fat book six inches square that covers the whole city,
in two scales. In Manhattan, each page depicts one square mile, and
he expects you can walk one axis in 20 minutes; the other borough
sections are shown in squares two miles on a side, for driving.
</P>
<P>
   In all cases, the pages showing the next section, which are
enumerated in the margins, overlap deeply, so no street disappears
into the void. In the upper right corner of the right-hand page is
a schematic of the whole borough showing which part of it the map
on that page covers.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The adjoining pages read across, which produces inevitable
mismatches over the binding, but since the distances are small,
it's usually possible to figure out a name from another map. House
numbers, a maximum of one to a block, appear in white on the plum
background; they are hard to read.
</P>
<P>
   In the back of the book is a street index for each borough, some
utilitarian telephone listings, a baker's dozen of Top 100s _
attractions, education, government, hotels, recreation _ also with
phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   There is also Van Dam's choice of 10 watersheds in 100 years of
New York history. This paperback book is $10.95 at bookstores. Van
Dam: (800) 863-6537.
</P>
<P>
   In the department of free maps, The Map, the Metropolitan
Transit Authority's first overhaul of its subway diagram in almost
20 years, made its debut in January. It has been revised steadily,
most recently in July, to take note of construction changes.
</P>
<P>
   Such changes were also on the mind of John Tauranac, a
cartographer who put out two new New York maps earlier this year.
His Manhattan Buses and Subways, 7 Days a Week, 24 Hours a Day is a
tightly packed bundle. Unfolded, it is 16 by 9 inches; the four
plastic-coated panels present weekday subway and bus maps facing
each other, likewise the evening and late-night map pairs. One map
panel is given to Manhattan tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between bus service on weekdays and late at night
is remarkable: The day bus map is packed as tightly as the
subsurface of New York streets, while the night map looks as empty
as 2 a.m. The suggested retail price is $5.95.
</P>
<P>
   Tauranac's other new project will be a hit with tourists and
natives confused by expansion of the city: a map of Lower
Manhattan, from Houston Street south, but without the Lower East
Side east of Essex Street. The neighborhoods _ TriBeCa or the
financial district, for example _ are in varying pastels.
</P>
<P>
   This map is what you need to find your way in Battery Park City.
It shows the numbers on the big buildings on new streets like
Rector Place (not to be confused with Rector Street). Subway and
bus lines are shown. The map, also $5.95, is 12 by 18 inches, and
folds to pocket size.
</P>
<P>
   The new visitor center at 1560 Broadway, in the former Embassy
Theater at 46th Street on the east side of Times Square, is the
best source for transit maps. The center, opened by the Times
Square Business Improvement District, includes a Transit Museum
branch to sell Metrocards and souvenirs (like ties with subway
maps) and provide a good stock of The Map and the fresh new bus
maps for the five boroughs. The center is open 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
daily.
</P>
<P>
   Not all new maps get onto the counter as maps. According to
Matthew Magnozzi of Forest Saver, a small factory in Ronkonkoma,
N.Y., the initial printing of the Transit Authority's new map in
January contained an error: a piece of construction was by no means
done.
</P>
<P>
   Magnozzi said that a million copies of The Map were about to be
trashed when he salvaged them. The emblematic parts of these maps
now appear as covers on little 3-by-4-inch jotter notebooks, with
pages made from old topographical maps, print side down.
</P>
<P>
   These sell for $2.95. The Transit Museum booth at the visitor
center has a supply. Forest Saver: (516) 585-7044.

INVESTORS SHRUG OFF CLINTON NEWS; PRICES GAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   US stocks rebounded strongly Monday after plunging in early
morning trading as relieved investors decided that President
Clinton's video testimony on the White House sex scandal offered no
new bombshells that could spur impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   A jittery Wall Street, which awoke to sharply lower markets
around the globe, sent the Dow Jones industrial average down 185
points in the first half-hour of trading before bargain hunters
came out to lift the index nearly 38 points to close at 7933.25.
The bounce was enough to bring the 30-share Dow back to where it
started 1998. But the blue-chip index, full of household-name
stocks that are industry leaders, is still 15 percent below its
July 17 peak of 9337.97.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing political instability in Washington, D.C., and
shuddering at Tokyo's failure to pass finance reform measures
designed to pull Japan out of its worst economic crisis since World
War II, global stock exchanges &UR;  &LR;  took a drubbing. London closed
down 1.3 percent to a nine-month low, Frankfurt fell 4 percent, and
Paris slipped 3.5 percent. Tokyo stocks skidded to a 12-year low.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, early selling came mostly from foreign investors,
who had seen no good news the night before in Asia or Europe. Wall
Street's drop began only minutes after US television networks began
broadcasting Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; US mutual fund managers, worried about having to raise cash to
meet redemptions for nervous shareholders, may have simply sat on
the sidelines before jumping in to buy later in the day, analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
   By early afternoon, when networks finished airing Clinton's
four-hour grand jury testimony, investors were ready to shop.
Buying by bargain-hunting fund managers and computer-driven program
trading gave many shares, especially in the healthcare and
technology sectors, a boost.
</P>
<P>
   ``The market tracked perfectly the closing of the
(Clinton) &UR;  &LR; tape,'' said Ned Riley, BankBoston's chief investment
strategist. ``Clearly, traders' greatest fear was not realized.''
</P>
<P>
   With fewer fears that impeachment could distract Clinton from an
extraordinary bout of global financial &UR;  &LR;  volatility, investment
strategists are focusing their attention on the outlook for
corporate profits. Economists are also busy calibrating fallout
from Asia and Russia, whose financial and political instability has
whacked &UR;  &LR;  emerging markets worldwide, especially in Latin America.
</P>
<P>
   Riley said estimates by First Call, a financial data firm, that
fourth-quarter US corporate earnings would rise 17 percent and
level off to 13 percent in 1998 were too high. ``We are still under
pressure,'' he said, adding that earnings over both periods would
be flat or down 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign that mutual fund investors are also taking a more
cautious view, investors put nearly $4 billion into US stock funds
last week, according to Trim Tabs Financial Services of Santa Rosa,
Calif. The bulk of the cash went into conservative growth funds,
the fund tracking firm said.
</P>
<P>
   Other US market measures also showed gains Monday. The Standard
&AMP; Poor's 500 index, the broadest market proxy, ticked up 0.37
percent to close at 1023.89, while the technology-heavy NASDAQ
composite index gained 1 percent to close at 1680.43. The Russell
2000, full of smaller stocks, lost 0.62 percent to end at 362.64.
</P>
<P>
   Trading was light due to the Jewish New Year holiday, with three
issues declining for every two advancing on the New York Stock
Exchange.

FILM FESTIVAL PRIZES ITS PARADOXICAL NICHE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By PETER APPLEBOME   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It began 36 years ago, pre-cable, pre-Internet, back
when the current glut of culture and quasi-culture, had it been
foreseen, might have made its mission seem particularly daunting.
</P>
<P>
   But when the New York Film Festival returns on Friday with Woody
Allen's new film, ``Celebrity,'' it reflects the distinctly
diminished prospects for serious film and the way the festival
probably plays a more important role now than its originators could
have expected when it began.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which remains one of the smaller and most selective
of the major film festivals, will offer 28 films from 15 countries.
High-profile offerings include Allen's film, about the culture of
celebrity; Emir Kusturica's ``Black Cat, White Cat,'' about a Gypsy
settlement along the polluted banks of the Danube; and Todd
Solondz's ``Happiness,'' a dark look at a dysfunctional suburban
community.
</P>
<P>
   Other highlights include a special presentation of ``Strike,''
the first film made by Sergei Eisenstein; a tribute to Swedish
director Ingmar Bergman and showings of his new film, ``The
Presence of a Clown;'' and two films by the British director John
Boorman: his new one, ``The General,'' and his 1967 thriller,
``Point Blank.'' The festival ends on Oct. 11 with ``The Dreamlife
of Angels,'' the first film by French director Erick Zonca.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Pena, program director of the Film Society of Lincoln
Center and chairman of the screening committee for the festival,
said the event was taking place in a cultural environment that is
much more competitive and complicated than the world of the first
festival, which made its debut in 1963 with such films as Luis
Bunuel's ``Exterminating Angel,'' Roman Polanski's ``Knife in the
Water'' and Yasujiro Ozu's ``Autumn Afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   But, for all the explosion of the media, culture and
entertainment, Pena said, almost nothing has impinged on the
festival's mandate of giving exposure to worthy films from around
the world. Instead, while there is more theater, more performance
art, more music, more of most kinds of cultural experiences
available now than at the festival's start, that is definitely not
the case with serious film.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's much more culture, many more outlets than people might
have imagined when the festival began, but almost none of them
doing anything like what we do,'' he said. ``Take cable. Twenty
years ago, I think a lot of people were under the impression that
with this enormous number of channels, there would be this amazing
variety of things on television _ channels devoted just to old
French films or experimental films. It seems not to have happened
at all. A lot of cable is less provocative or less ambitious than a
lot of broadcast TV. Rather than an opening-up of culture, in some
ways it's made people more American-centric.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the decline of repertory or art-house theaters and the
narrowed opportunities for anything other than Hollywood
blockbusters and skillfully marketed independent films make the
festival at least as important now as it ever has been, Pena said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thirty years ago, there was a much healthier alternative or
independent or art-house scene showing foreign-language films,'' he
said. ``There's been a great lessening of the role these kinds of
films play in the American cultural life. Some people say that's
because foreign films are just not as good anymore as they were in
the 50s, 60s and 70s when people flocked to these films.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, my colleagues and I disagree. There's an enormous
amount of wonderful stuff from all over, from Iran, from Taiwan. A
festival like ours is such an important launching pad because the
commercial possibilities of these films are so much less than they
once were.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the festival has introduced the American public
to films like Francois Truffaut's ``Day for Night,'' Marcel Ophuls'
``Sorrow and the Pity,'' Bernardo Bertolucci's ``Last Tango in
Paris,'' Neil Jordan's ``Crying Game'' and Quentin Tarantino's
``Pulp Fiction.''
</P>
<P>
   The most talked-about of this year's films may be ``Happiness,''
by Solondz, whose ``Welcome to the Dollhouse'' was a critical
success in 1996. The film, which will be released in theaters on
Oct. 16, is a scabrous look at the relationships and sexual mores
of an extended family in a well-heeled New Jersey suburb.
</P>
<P>
   But the festival, as always, tries to cover as much cultural and
cinematic ground as possible. Familiar names include Alain Resnais,
with ``Same Old Song,'' and Eric Rohmer, with ``A Tale of Autumn,''
the final work in his ``Tales of the Four Seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Less familiar names likely to get attention include Samira
Makhmalbaf, an Iranian, whose first film, ``The Apple,'' tells the
story of young sisters imprisoned by their father in their home and
what happens after their liberation. ``The Celebration,'' by a
Danish director, Thomas Vinterberg, is a taut family melodrama.
``Flowers of Shanghai,'' by a Taiwanese director, Hou Hsiao-hsien,
is a tale of sexual intrigue, set in a 19th-century Shanghai
brothel, that is based on an 1894 novel.
</P>
<P>
   Wendy Keys, executive producer for special projects with the
Film Society, said this year's festival, rather than reflecting a
particular trend, reflected the breadth of high-quality films being
made.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are very individual films,'' she said. ``They don't
speak to any trend; they each pop up as their own entity, rather
than as part of something larger.''

 YOU PROBABLY WON'T WANT AN ENCORE OF `ENCORE, ENCORE!'
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN LEVESQUE  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite the title, there might not be a nationwide clamor for a
curtain call from ``Encore! Encore!''
</P>
<P>
   With marquee names like Nathan Lane and Joan Plowright and the
delightul Glenne Headly behind it, one is tempted to assume the
result will be a slam-dunk piece of first-rate entertainment. But
the new NBC comedy starring Lane as a faded opera star has had a
long and trying gestation, complete with retooling and recasting of
characters, and its birth tonight is still a difficult one. Bottom
line: When the material is weak, famous names don't mean diddly.
</P>
<P>
   By placing it between ``Mad About You'' and ``Just Shoot Me,''
NBC is saying that ``Encore! Encore!'' is a favored child. Never
mind that ``Mad About You'' is well past its prime and ``Just Shoot
Me'' hasn't reached it yet. The shows do reasonably well in the
ratings, which should mean nice numbers for the new kid.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they're deserved is always the big-money question, and
based on tonight's premiere episode and a second one provided
critics in advance, ``Encore! Encore!'' will have a hard time
making it to a smattering of applause in New Haven, let alone a
standing ovation on Broadway.
</P>
<P>
   Lane's portrayal of retired tenor Joseph Pinoni, whose voice
went south and forced him to move west to the family vineyards in
the Napa Valley, is much too mannered to be funny. And Plowright,
as his widowed mother, Marie, is overly theatrical in a Julia Child
warble. Granted, exaggeration, especially Joseph's uncontrollable
need to be in the spotlight, is part of the story line here, but
only Glenne Headly, as Joseph's sister, Francesca, seems grounded
in some sort of reality. Which brings to mind the broad ``realism''
of the people in ``Frasier,'' a show that manages to make its
characters believable in spite of ridiculous situations and absurd
personal traits.
</P>
<P>
   ``Encore! Encore!'' is from the people who created ``Frasier,''
so there may still be hope. But where the writing on ``Frasier'' is
so original that I sometimes slap my forehead in amazement, the
first couple of scripts from ``Encore! Encore!'' make me want to
slap someone at NBC. Again and again.
</P>
<P>
   A better bet at 8:30 tonight might be ``The Hughleys'' on ABC,
in which comedian D.L. Hughley doesn't have to stretch too far to
play Darryl Hughley, an upwardly mobile African American
businessman who moves his family to a new house in a new
neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   The new neighborhood isn't at all like the old one, and it's
taking a while for D.L. to find his comfort zone. For example, he's
ill at ease in a place where you can pump your gas without having
to pay first. And people being neighborly _ that is, white people
being neighborly _ cause him to doubt their intentions and suspect
they're up to something.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, his best friend and sales manager Milsap (John Henton)
is no help, offering constant reminders that Darryl is on the
``slippery slope'' to losing his blackness.
</P>
<P>
   What makes ``The Hughleys'' appealing isn't anything
particularly mysterious. D.L. Hughley is a very funny guy. Perhaps
more salient for a lot of white folks: He is non-threatening, in
the Bill Cosby style. Elise Neal, who plays his TV wife, Yvonne, is
immensely appealing, and their well-meaning neighbors (Eric Allan
Kramer and Marietta DePrima), strike just the right combination of
warmth and skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Like any program with a message, ``The Hughleys'' plays up
stereotypes in order to expose them, but it avoids descending into
30-minute sermonizing or, worse, crude buffoonery. Instead, it
manages to point out the folly without losing the jolly. With a
little more polishing, ``The Hughleys'' can be a delicious treat,
even though it reminds us how far we have to go before people stop
making comedies about race relations.
</P>
<P>
   The fear among some TV types is that ``Sports Night'' is too
``inside baseball'' to appeal to mainstream America. The fact is,
``Sports Night'' isn't about sports, just as ``MASH'' wasn't about
the Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, there's a lot of sports jargon tossed about in ``Sports
Night,'' which takes place in the studios of an ESPN-style daily
sports program. But a show like ``ER'' doesn't seem to be
alienating too many viewers when it tosses around terms like
``gastric lavage'' and ``cross-table C-spine.'' Just a guess here,
but America's non-sporting public can probably handle a few
jock-ular references without panicking.
</P>
<P>
   And well they should. ``Sports Night'' is a terrific new show
from Aaron Sorkin, the guy who wrote the films ``A Few Good Men''
and ``The American President.'' Sorkin is expert at going for a
lump-in-the-throat, tear-in-the-eye reaction, but I'll take his
kind of manipulation over the standard sitcom setup in a Hollywood
minute, which is the same as a New York minute, only three hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Krause, Josh Charles, Felicity Huffman, Robert Guillaume
and a marvelous pack of supporting players lend a palpable pulse to
the most stylishly produced workplace/relationship series to arrive
in some time.
</P>
<P>
   Though packaged like a comedy, ``Sports Night'' isn't always
funny. It's just seriously good TV. Sign up for season tickets.

NEGATIVE ADS BEGIN EARLY IN GOVERNOR RACE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIAN WALKER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ After just a few days of forswearing personal attacks,
the candidates for governor turned negative and released TV ads
that deride each other's record.
</P>
<P>
   Acting Governor Paul Cellucci fired the first shot at Democratic
nominee Scott Harshbarger Friday with an ad that says the attorney
general opposes mandatory testing for teachers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger,'' the ad intones. ``We can't afford to take
the risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger struck back Monday with a 30-second spot that shows
him in shirtsleeves attempting to set the record straight. He says
he does support teacher testing, then jabs the Republican Cellucci
for his vetoes of expanded health care for children and tax cuts
that mostly benefit the wealthy.
</P>
<P>
   The negative ads, while coming a bit earlier than expected, are
symptomatic of a campaign in which the candidates do not have sharp
differences of opinion on many of the major issues. Both support
tax cuts, increased spending for education, and more day care. Both
are tough on crime. They differ on the death penalty, which
Cellucci supports and Harshbarger opposes, but that has rapidly
receded as a major issue since the Legislature voted it down last
October.
</P>
<P>
   Both ads are partly true. But both are veer substantially from
the truth.
</P>
<P>
   _ Harshbarger supports teacher testing but has opposed firing
teachers solely on the basis of test results. He says tests should
be used as part of a comprehensive, meaningful evaluation but said
in a televised debate last month that he would fire teachers who
fail the tests.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cellucci says Harshbarger has caved to union pressure on
teacher testing. But Harshbarger differs with the Massachusetts
Teachers Association, which opposes testing.
</P>
<P>
   In Harshbarger's spot, he makes two claims _ that Cellucci's tax
cuts go to the wealthy while his are targeted at the middle class
and the elderly, and that Cellucci supported tobacco companies and
vetoed children's health care.
</P>
<P>
   _ On tobacco, Governor William F. Weld vetoed a measure in 1996
that would have provided health care for 168,000 low-income
children through a 25-cent-a-pack tax increase on cigarettes,
arguing that he supported the goal but not the tax hike. But last
year, a massive increase in the Medicaid program boosted health
coverage for low-income children, including all children whose
families earn twice the federal poverty limit or less. An estimated
50,000 children remain uninsured.
</P>
<P>
   The argument on tax cuts centers around Harshbarger's contention
that his proposed cuts, which would come mainly in the form of
deductions, more directly benefit the middle class. The
Weld-Cellucci tax cuts, he argues, included capital gains cuts that
favor the wealthy, and cuts for the mutual fund and insurance
industries.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci has maintained that the administration's economic
policies have contributed to a 3 percent unemployment rate and a
robust economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Harshbarger and Cellucci Monday continued their
battle over fiscal issues, squabbling over figures and cost
calculations for various proposals put forth by the Democratic
nominee.
</P>
<P>
   The flare-up began with the acting governor accusing the
Democratic nominee of paving the way for new tax hikes because of
his new spending proposals, a persistent theme of Cellucci's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Massachusetts cannot afford Scott Harshbarger,'' Cellucci
said. ``He would be a governor who would outspend the
Legislature.''
</P>
<P>
   But Harshbarger aides said Cellucci is using ``distortions and
inaccurate statements'' to promote his ``campaign of fear'' over
state finances and taxes. They also said Cellucci is wrong in
concluding Harshbarger has proposed $1.1 billion in spending for
new programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger has proposed $400 million in new spending on
initiatives important to working people,'' said Dwight Robson,
Harshbarger's campaign press secretary.
</P>
<P>
   State Senator Warren Tolman of Watertown, Harshbarger's running
mate, announced a three-point plan to improve the state's tracking
of education reform spending. The centerpiece of that plan is a
software program that will monitor spending in each school
district, at a cost of about $5 million.

MID-AMERICA DEPLORES LATEST CLINTON PROGRAMMING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MITCHELL ZUCKOFF  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBUS, Ohio _ At Henry's on High restaurant Monday, the
owner, Henry Tran, offered a lunch special featuring thick &UR;  &LR; slices
of bologna. He swore it wasn't a sly commentary on the airing of
President Clinton's taped grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   If anything, Tran and most of the lunchtime patrons at his
downtown eatery seemed to wish they could turn the television
behind the bar back to its usual fare of daytime talk shows and
soap operas.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be behind closed doors,'' said Tran, a Vietnamese
immigrant, seeming pained by the spectacle unfolding on the 20-inch
screen behind him. ``It's embarrassing to this country in the eyes
of the world. It makes me feel sorry for everybody. And I feel
sorry for Clinton, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the people don't respect the president, it is like the
children don't respect the parent, and that is terrible,'' Tran
said.
</P>
<P>
   At a nearby table, Darlene Edwards and Sherry Wilkie, accounts
payable clerks on their lunch hour, did their best to ignore the
president but now and again were drawn to the television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's immoral what he did, but I don't need to see
this,'' said Edwards, who indicated her bologna sandwich was an
appropriate choice for the day. ``This should be between him and
his wife, but they probably just want to humiliate him further and
drag it all out.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkie, though, saw a purpose to release of the grand jury
video: ``They're trying to make him resign, and I think that's
really the right thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Front and center at the bar sat Tom Swisher, a deputy clerk at
the Franklin County Courthouse, his head bobbing up and down
between the screen and his plate of American chop suey. ``It sounds
like to me he's trying to convince everybody he's telling the
truth. I don't know if he is, but we're all human and I feel this
has gone too far,'' Swisher said.
</P>
<P>
   Swisher said he would like to see Monica Lewinsky's testimony as
well, because ``we all know it takes two to tango.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe it would have been better if President Clinton had just
taken out his tenor sax and played, `Who's sorry now?''' Swisher
said, chuckling.
</P>
<P>
   But fellow court clerks Mike Cherry and Tammy Van Gundy weren't
ready to let it go at that. ``The part about what he did doesn't
bother me,'' Cherry said. ``It's the lies. The American people will
never believe him again, and nothing he is saying to the grand jury
will change that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Gundy agreed, but like others was squeamish about airing on
national television, during the day, a tape with the president
being asked about explicit sex acts. ``Little kids are going to
pick up words they don't understand and shouldn't understand, and
they're going to ask questions. This isn't good for the children,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   As court veterans, Cherry and Van Gundy were quick to point out
what they saw as flaws in Clinton's testimony demeanor. ``He's
sweating bad, he's just flat-out lying,'' said Cherry, just as
Clinton was being asked about a tie given him by Lewinsky. ``I've
just never seen anyone dodge a question the way he does.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's really edgy,'' added Van Gundy.
</P>
<P>
   Down the street at the Gentlemen's Book Store, there were plenty
of sexually explicit videos available. Yet neither the patrons nor
the clerk seemed to have any interest in watching or hearing the
president's testimony. The television was on, but the video being
shown had very little talking.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they should leave the guy alone,'' said the clerk,
declining to give his name.
</P>
<P>
   Over at the sparkling Center City Mall, there were more than a
dozen impressive televisions on display at The Home Theater Inc.,
an electronics store. But the only thing showing was the movie,
``George of the Jungle.''
</P>
<P>
   A salesman said he had tuned in to Clinton's testimony earlier
in the morning, but then switched to the movies. ``This (movie)
shows off the picture better on the TVs,'' he said. ``Maybe I'll
read about Clinton's testimony tomorrow.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the camera never once showed even a
glimpse of Kenneth Starr or his team of inquisitors, the
prosecutors' mission remained clear throughout President Clinton's
grand jury testimony: to prove that the president of the United
States is a liar.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing on the videotape only as disembodied voices, the
prosecutors pressed the president harder and harder in an effort to
pin down his answers to their relentless questions about his
intimate contacts with former White House intern Monica Lewinsky
and his efforts to hide their affair.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with hours of vivid descriptions from Ms. Lewinsky about
specific sexual encounters she said she had with the president, the
prosecutors aggressively set out to prove that the president
repeatedly lied under oath.
</P>
<P>
   The first lie the prosecutors set out to expose was Clinton's
denial of having sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky last January in
the Jones sexual misconduct case. And then, when the president
continued to insist that his testimony in the Jones case had been
``legally accurate,'' they appeared to be trying to build a much
graver offense, lying to the grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' tactics ranged from courteous interchanges with
Clinton, to going back four or five times to the same line of
inquiry, to the same sexual act, to the same quotes from the Jones
deposition. Clinton expressed his frustrations with the repetitive
nature of their queries and with the impression his answers had on
the jury: ``Look, I'm not trying to be evasive here. I'm trying to
protect my privacy, my family's privacy, and I'm trying to stick to
what the deposition was about. If the deposition wasn't about this
and didn't cover it, then I don't believe that I should be required
to go beyond my statement.''
</P>
<P>
   Dragging a witness before a grand jury primarily to force false
testimony is known in legal parlance as a perjury trap. Prosecutors
use this technique when proving a predicate crime is more difficult
than proving subsequent false statements made under oath.
</P>
<P>
   In a classic perjury trap, prosecutors call a suspect before a
grand jury for the primary purpose of obtaining false testimony in
order to later prosecute him for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   In the case of Clinton, some of the previous acts under
investigation by Starr were alleged false statements made in the
Jones civil suit that was later dismissed, and his prosecution has
been considered unusual by some legal experts. But among the
thousands of pages of material from Starr's investigation released
Monday were legal references on perjury statutes in which the
independent counsel concluded, ``The Department of Justice often
prosecutes for perjury that occurs during the course of civil
proceedings,'' citing eight cases.
</P>
<P>
   E. Lawrence Barcella, a former federal prosecutor, said Starr's
techniques were intended to trap the president. ``This was the
classic situation where you dig a hole, cover it with leaves and
twigs and then beckon someone to walk towards you,'' Barcella said.
</P>
<P>
   But Bradford Berenson, a white-collar criminal law expert, said,
``This wasn't a perjury trap. It was a slam-dunk perjury case.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the grand jury session released on videotape Monday,
Starr clearly attempted to assemble the strongest possible perjury
case, one that later served as the backbone of his 445-page report.
During a crucial confrontation with Solomon L. Wisenberg, a former
assistant U.S. attorney in San Antonio, Texas, the president
insisted that he did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky as
it was defined in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   The president told Wisenberg, ``You are free to infer that my
testimony is that I did not have sexual relations, as I understood
this term to be defined.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, the president stressed how seriously he took the
definition of sexual relations in the Jones case, which outlined,
``contact with the genitalia, anus, groin, breast, inner thigh, or
buttocks of any person with an intent to arouse or gratify the
sexual desire of any person.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to acknowledge, because of this definition, that under
this definition I had actually had sexual relations once with
Gennifer Flowers, a person who has spread all kinds of ridiculous,
dishonest, exaggerated stories about me for money,'' the president
testified. ``And I knew when I did that, it would be leaked. It
was. And I was embarrassed. But I did it.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I tried to read this carefully,'' the president continued.
``I can tell you what I thought it covered, and I can tell you that
I do not believe I did anything that I thought was covered by
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The president and his lawyers knew going into his grand jury
appearance that he would be grilled about graphic descriptions
given by Ms. Lewinsky, and physical evidence, including a dress
possibly stained with the president's semen.
</P>
<P>
   With his lawyers, the president constructed a strategy that
tried to bend around Starr's evidence: The president would admit to
an ``inappropriate intimate'' relationship with Ms. Lewinsky but
insist that their affair did not fit the Jones case definition of
sexual relations.
</P>
<P>
   This sophisticated but somewhat tortured legal dodge was one the
prosecutors were determined to shatter. The definition of the Jones
case clearly did include contacts with Ms. Lewinsky's breasts and
genitalia and Ms. Lewinsky testified that the president had touched
and kissed her breasts in nine incidents and that there were four
contacts with her genitalia.
</P>
<P>
   Wisenberg, who took the lead in questioning the president about
his sexual encounters with Ms. Lewinsky, pressed Clinton when he
denied having sexual contact with Ms. Lewinsky that fell within the
scope of the Jones case. ``Including touching her breast, kissing
her breast, or touching her genitalia?'' Wisenberg asked. The
president tersely responded, ``That is correct.'' During this
exchange, the president also said that he understood that the
physical contact had to be ``direct.'' Lawyers familiar with his
testimony have said that could exclude contact through clothing.
</P>
<P>
   Making a second approach, Wisenberg posed another series of
sexually explicit questions, asking the president whether Ms.
Lewinsky would be lying if she contradicted his testimony about
intimacy. During these protracted exchanges about sex, Clinton
became combative and refused to elaborate on his opening statement.
</P>
<P>
   Both sides tried to sway the grand jurors during the four hours
of testimony. The president appealed to their common sense and
decency: ``I'm not trying to evade my legal obligations or my
willingness to help the grand jury achieve their legal
obligations,'' the president testified, adding later, ``And I
believe you can achieve that without requiring me to say and do
things that I don't think are necessary and that I think, frankly,
go too far in trying to criminalize my private life.''
</P>
<P>
   As Wisenberg tried repeatedly to elicit answers to the most
incendiary sexual questions, he warned Clinton that the grand
jurors, not just prosecutors, wanted more detail: At one point, he
threatened the president, saying: ``I need to inform you, Mr.
President _ we'll go on at least for now. But I need to inform you
that the grand jury will consider your not answering the questions
more directly in their determination of whether or not they are
going to issue another subpoena.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Starr cited five instances where he alleged that
Clinton had lied under oath in his impeachment report to the
Congress. The first and second items of that referral cite Clinton
for lying in the Jones case ``regarding his sexual relationship
with Monica Lewinsky'' and lying a second time about it before the
grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The three other perjury charges involve other evasive answers
the president gave in the Jones case, about having ever been alone
with Ms. Lewinsky, about talking with her about her testimony in
the Jones case and efforts to help her get a job.

PROBERS EXAMINING TRIPP TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- The office of the independent counsel is
investigating Linda Tripp, one of its key witnesses, for possibly
lying under oath after an FBI analysis indicated that nine tapes of
her recorded conversations with Monica S. Lewinsky had been
duplicated.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp said in both a deposition and grand jury testimony that
the tapes she made of her friend were originals.
</P>
<P>
   Nine of the 16 tapes analyzed had been recorded on a different
tape recorder than the machine Tripp said she used, according to
the evidence gathered by Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr and
released by the House Judiciary Committee Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's veracity is important because she triggered the
independent counsel's investigation of the Lewinsky affair when she
contacted him on January 12 to say she had more than 20 hours of
taped conversation with Lewinsky. She also provided the information
to the lawyers for Paula Jones, the former state employee from
Arkansas who sued Clinton for sexual harassment.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes moved Starr to enlist Tripp to record further
conversations with Lewinsky, and provided the grounding for
questions about the Lewinsky affair posed to Clinton during his
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case. They may well
have also been used by the counsel to help win authorization from
Attorney General Janet Reno to expand his probe to include the
sexual scandal.
</P>
<P>
   But the independent counsel became suspicious about Tripp's
truthfulness after the tapes were examined by the FBI Audio Signal
Analysis Unit in Quantico, Va., according to evidence gathered by
Starr and released Monday by the House Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Before questions about the authenticity of the tapes emerged,
Starr had already granted Tripp immunity from prosecution and
promised he would try to persuade the state of Maryland not to
prosecute her for violating the state's wiretapping law, which
prohibits such secret tape recording. Maryland prosecutors have
proceeded with their investigation of Tripp, and that probe is
ongoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Ms. Tripp duplicated any tapes herself or knew of their
duplication, then she has lied under oath before the grand jury and
in a deposition,'' the document said. ``The (Office of Independent
Counsel) continues to investigate this matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's lawyer, Anthony Zaccagnini, would not comment on the
report.
</P>
<P>
   In Starr's report to Congress last week, he charged that the
president lied under oath in responses to questions Jones's lawyers
in a Jan. 17 deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp testified before the Starr grand jury for two weeks,
longer than any other witness. Moreover, the Lewinsky tapes
initially were used by prosecutors to establish the sexual
relationship between president and the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes in question contain conversations about Tripp's
meeting with her lawyer after receiving a subpoena in the Paula
Jones sexual-harassment case; Lewinsky's discussions with UN
Ambassador Bill Richardson about a job; Lewinsky's meetings with
Clinton friend Vernon Jordan; and Lewinsky's subpoena in the Jones
case.
</P>
<P>
   In one tape, Tripp tells Lewinsky to speak to her mother, Marcia
Lewis, about ``their plan'' to avoid the Jones subpoenas. Lewinsky
reports back that her mother found the plan ``brilliant.'' The plan
reportedly called for Lewinsky to move to New York to avoid
testifying.
</P>
<P>
   A preliminary examination by the FBI found that eight of the
tapes that Tripp gave Starr's investigators appeared to be
authentic. But nine others ``exhibit characteristics that are not
consistent with being recorded on the Radio Shack CTR107 tape
recorder Ms. Tripp says she used to record the original tapes,''
the document said.
</P>
<P>
   Of the nine, two contain inaudible recordings. ``For the seven
tapes which contain audible conversations and which exhibit signs
of duplication, the Office of Independent Counsel cannot exclude
the possibility of tampering at this time,'' the document said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, one of the tapes that appeared to be duplicated
also seemed to have been stopped and reactivated during the
recording process, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp purchased a voice activated tape recorder from Radio Shack
on October 3, 1997, and attached it to a telephone in the study of
her Maryland home. She used it to record many of her telephone
conversations with Lewinsky from October 3, 1997, until January 15,
1998. After a tape was filled, she would not catalog it but store
it unmarked in a bowl on a piece of furniture, the document said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the documents, the independent counsel's office
went to some lengths to verify the dates the tapes were made,
cross-referencing them with independent sources and news reports.
</P>
<P>
   After making the first two tapes, Tripp met with Lucianne
Goldberg, a New York book agent, and Goldberg's son and business
associate, Jonah, and Michael Isikoff, the Newsweek magazine
investigative reporter. Goldberg made copies of the original tapes
in New York. She handed over the originals to the prosecutor last
January. Tripp was working with Goldberg on a possible book deal.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp, a secretary in the counsel's office at the White House
during the Bush administration, remained in the White House for the
first year of the Clinton administration but eventually transferred
to the Pentagon. There she met Lewinsky, who had been transferred
from her White House job.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp also took two sets of notes on her conversations with
Lewinsky between May 23, 1997, and July 1997. Tripp told the
prosecutor that Lewinsky was aware of the first set of notes but
not the second. Lewinsky told prosecutors she never knew her friend
was taking notes.
</P>
<P>
   The information released Monday only includes a summary of the
Tripp-Lewinsky conversations. The actual tapes and transcripts are
contained in another box of evidence that has not yet been released
by the Judiciary Committee.

PARKING METER COLLECTIONS OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH POCKETING
QUARTERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JOHN KIFNER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The official in charge of collecting quarters from
the city's 65,000 parking meters stands accused of pocketing
thousands of the coins himself.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Ginter, the acting chief of meter collections for the
city's Department of Transportation, was stuffing handfulls of
pilfered quarters into a coin redemption machine, authorities said,
when he was arrested on Saturday at a Waldbaum's supermarket in
Forest Hills, Queens.
</P>
<P>
   He had put 1,086 quarters into the Coinstar machine _ worth
$271.50 before the system took a 7.5 percent surcharge to convert
the coins into paper money _ when he was arrested, according to the
Queens district attorney's office. When searched, Ginter had
another 295 quarters in his pockets.
</P>
<P>
   All told, said Commissioner Edward Kuriansky of the city
Department of Investigation, Ginter was accused of making off with
as many as 14,400 quarters _ $3,600 _ from parking meter proceeds
by siphoning off from 800 to 1,200 quarters at a time on 12
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Ginter's haul put only a small dent in the roughly $70 million
in coin revenue the city takes in from parking meters.
</P>
<P>
   And as New York City parking corruption cases go, it was a
low-budget version of the Parking Violations Bureau scandal of the
1980s, a bribery and kickback scheme that brought down some of the
city's most powerful Democratic politicians and raised the profile
of a Republican prosecutor named Rudolph Giuiliani.
</P>
<P>
   Ginter, 40, had served as acting collections chief, at a salary
of $45,810, for the last two years. He supervised a staff of 166 at
the Transportation Department's meter collection facility in
Queens. He has been suspended without pay and, if convicted, could
face a prison sentence of up to four years on charges of grand
larceny and official misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   A call to Ginter's home was unanswered.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The city's parking meters are emptied by removing the metal
cylinders containing coins, which are released into a locked
strongbox. The strongboxes are then brought to the central
collection facility.
</P>
<P>
   At the Queens headquarters, the quarters are put into counting
machines that tally them for deposit into municipal coffers. The
machines, however, reject some quarters because they are bent,
chipped or otherwise damaged. Those quarters are put into a
`'reject pile'' and are eventually redeemed by the U.S. Mint.
</P>
<P>
   It was in that pile, investigators said, that Ginter found his
booty.
</P>
<P>
   He converted the coins to paper money, Kuriansky said, by using
Coinstar machines at supermarkets near his office and his Queens
home.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation began with an anonymous tip that someone was
making off with coins from the collection center. It soon focused
on Ginter. The supermarkets cooperated with the investigation,
officials said, furnishing surveillance tapes showing Ginter
diligently feeding the Coinstar machines.
</P>
<P>
   In a search of Ginter's office, officials said, they found a
stash of 2,827 quarters.
</P>
<P>
   `'I guess you could characterize him as a two-bit thief,'' said
the Queens district attorney, Richard Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those parking their cars may not have been on the level
either. In Ginter's own car, investigators found 758 Garden State
Parkway tokens, 124 Delaware Bridge tokens, and 9 Roosevelt Island
tram tokens, apparently deposited in meters and rejected by the
city's counting machine.

NO SMOKING GUN   SEEN, WHITE HOUSE SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was not the smoking gun.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton's videotaped grand jury testimony, which aired
Monday on national television, was neither the bombshell that White
House aides had feared, nor the revelation that would end debate
over whether he should remain in office, the aides said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe any objective observer would conclude that
they saw anything approaching the kind of high crimes and
misdemeanors that the Constitution requires for removing a
president from office,'' said James Kennedy, a White House lawyer
and spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   White House Press Secretary Michael D. McCurry said ``that the
president's conduct does not rise to the level of an impeachable
offense should now be clear to everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   In a statement, he condemned the ``unprecedented violation of
grand jury secrecy'' and ``rank partisanship'' by Republicans on
the House Judiciary Committee who voted last week to release the
videotaped testimony along with nearly 3,200 pages of documents.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry and other White House aides acknowledged that it may
take several days to measure the impact of the president's
testimony on public opinion, and that those views are likely to be
shaped by the media, since most Americans are unlikely to have seen
the more than four-hour videotape in its entirety.
</P>
<P>
   To that end, White House aides rushed to put the best face on
Clinton's testimony while assigning the worst motives to
Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr and Republican House Judiciary
members.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said that ``the facts sometimes don't match the
breathless anticipation.'' Another senior aide said flatly that
Republicans had ``dramatically oversold'' how damaging the
videotape would be to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Several aides, who were expecting to see Clinton lose his
temper, were surprised that he projected as much calm as he did,
although he was clearly irritated and angry. ``It looked
presentable image-wise, and the president came across quite
naturally, given the circumstances,'' a senior aide said.
</P>
<P>
   As the videotape was being carried live on television, Clinton
was in New York speaking on the threat of international terrorism
to the United Nations General Assembly, where he was greeted by
warm applause and a standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his lawyers were making plans to sift through the
newly released documents from Starr, while his aides geared up for
more outreach to House and Senate Democrats, whose support the
president will need to head off possible impeachment preceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic pollster, said he doubted that the
president's testimony would change public perceptions on either
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be more confirming for people on both sides
of the question _ rather than transforming,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is seen as a battle between the president on one side and
the Republicans and Starr on the other,'' he continued. ``I don't
think there are any big winners today, each side may have lost a
little bit of ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican House Judiciary members Charles T. Canady of Forida
and James E. Rogan of California, said they were disturbed by
Clinton's legal hair-splitting in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``When people go before the grand jury, they have a
responsibility to answer the questions that are put to them, or
plead the Fifth Amendment,'' Canady said. ``The president had that
choice, like any other person, but he chose another way, and that
was simply not to answer the questions, and engage in an extended
process there of presenting what he wanted to say.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogan said that ``watching 4 1/2 hours of the president continue
to parse, in minute detail, areas of the law, which to the average
person just sound absolutely ludicrous and silly, is not a proud
day for our legal system. It certainly isn't a proud day for our
country.''
</P>
<P>
   On the latter point, McCurry agreed. He called the release of
the president's testimony and its airing on television ``arguably
an unnecessary day in the life of our country, an awful day.''
</P>
<P>
   He said, ``How people react ... will be judgments that are going
to be made in living rooms and at dining tables around the country
tonight. There's no way that we can predict what people will
think.''

 &HT;    Clinton video delivered a mortal president to a watching nation
 &HT;    (EDS: Moving to (w) Washington and (e) Entertainment
categories.)By Lyle V. Harris
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This was not TV as usual.
</P>
<P>
   The picture was fuzzy and an annoying hiss made it hard to hear
President Clinton's taped testimony before the federal grand jury
investigating his relationship with former intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   But what Monday's seminal TV event lacked in glitzy production
values, it more than made up for in high-stakes drama and low-ball
expectations.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, pundits had described the tape of Clinton's Aug. 17
testimony as ``historic'' and ``unprecedented'' and in many
respects they were right: no other sitting president has been
questioned so publicly about a sexual indiscretion on national
television.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, it's hard to remember when history looked this small.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the grave implications for the fate of his presidency,
the same unifying medium that brought Americans the aftermath of
the Kennedy assasination, a moon-walking Neil Armstrong and the
final episode of ``Seinfeld'' struggled to put Clinton's more than
four hours of testimony in perspective.
</P>
<P>
   As the tape began airing at 9:25 a.m., Clinton, wearing a dark
suit and a gold-toned tie, seemed almost lonely sitting in a
non-descript room in the White House, an arrangement of orange and
blue flowers in the distance over his right shoulder. His lawyer
David Kendall was off-camera.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Clinton's inquisitors were miles away at a federal
courthouse and could be heard only on the videotape as faint,
disembodied voices who deferentially referred to the president as
``sir'' even when asking the most intimate, and embarrassing
questions.
</P>
<P>
   It had all started just two minutes earlier. The simple act of
slipping a tape into a VCR seemed to take on new meaning as it was
handed to a technician ``laboring in the bowels of Congress'' as
CNN's Candy Crowley described it.
</P>
<P>
   Several moments later as the tape cued up, a picture of Bill
Clinton jerked into focus. John King, a White House correspondent
for CNN claimed that Americans ``have never seen anything like
this, the president raising his hand and taking an oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly true since Clinton has taken an oath of office twice
during his inauguration ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   However the tape did show Clinton to be more mortal than ever.
Before the questioning began, the president could be seen cleaning
his ear with his finger. Later, he gulped down a can of ginger ale
and a diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're usually watching `Teletubbies' ( a PBS children's
show) right now you shouldn't be watching this,'' warned Dan
Rather, the anchor-philosopher of CBS before the president began
answering questions from prosecutors. ``If you are, go ask mommy
for permission.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, CNN and Fox News followed their game plan to run the tape
in its entirety without editing details of the sexual aspects of
Clinton's testimony. They continuously aired parental warnings
about content.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC, CBS and ABC which had considered running only edited
excerpts, shifted gears and decided to run the tape ``wall to
wall'' pre-empting their daytime programming of soaps and talk
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to say with the testimony because it was so
compelling and interesting,'' said Alex Constantinople, a
spokeswoman for NBC News. The network cut away from the videotape
on two occassions for a total of six minutes because ``we were
concerned that children might be watching and that some of the
graphic material that was being discussed might offend our
viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC also aired the testimony in full, but employed a 5-second
delay which would have enabled the network to edit offensive or
graphic material, said spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. It wasn't
necessary, but anchor Peter Jennings repeatedly warned viewers
about the tapes contents, she said. CBS played it even safer, and
used a 30-second taped delay.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's coverage which started at 7 a.m. _ more than two hours
before the tapes were released _ seemed to be taking a toll on
anchors trying to keep track of the network's cadre of field
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie and I have been at this awhile and we're both losing
it,'' said CNN anchor Judy Woodruff when co-host Bernard Shaw
flubbed a seque long after the tape had concluded.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Congressional reporter Joe Johns also had a difficult time
early in the morning, even though he appeared to be the first of
the journalistic pack to get his hands on the tape's supporting
documents. As he began reading excerpts, Johns suddenly disappeared
from the screen, and anchor Tom Brokaw explained later that the
network had suffered ``an electronic meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone on TV was having a Monica meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   In a cheesy bit of counter-programming on WAGA, talk show host
Sally Jesse Raphael aired a special segment that seemed to fit the
theme of the day: ``Office Affairs Exposed.''

questions.
</P>
<P>
   It had all started just two minutes earlier. The simple act of
slipping a tape into a VCR seemed to take on new meaning as it was
handed to a technician ``laboring in the bowels of Congress'' as
CNN's Candy Crowley described it.
</P>
<P>
   Several moments later as the tape cued up, a picture of Bill
Clinton jerked into focus. John King, a White House correspondent
for CNN claimed that Americans ``have never seen anything like
this, the president raising his hand and taking an oath.''
</P>
<P>
   Not exactly true since Clinton has taken an oath of office twice
during his inauguration ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   However the tape did show Clinton to be more mortal than ever.
Before the questioning began, the president could be seen cleaning
his ear with his finger. Later, he gulped down a can of ginger ale
and a diet Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're usually watching `Teletubbies' ( a PBS children's
show) right now you shouldn't be watching this,'' warned Dan
Rather, the anchor-philosopher of CBS before the president began
answering questions from prosecutors. ``If you are, go ask mommy
for permission.''
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, CNN and Fox News followed their game plan to run the tape
in its entirety without editing details of the sexual aspects of
Clinton's testimony. They continuously aired parental warnings
about content.
</P>
<P>
   But NBC, CBS and ABC which had considered running only edited
excerpts, shifted gears and decided to run the tape ``wall to
wall'' pre-empting their daytime programming of soaps and talk
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to say with the testimony because it was so
compelling and interesting,'' said Alex Constantinople, a
spokeswoman for NBC News. The network cut away from the videotape
on two occassions for a total of six minutes because ``we were
concerned that children might be watching and that some of the
graphic material that was being discussed might offend our
viewers.''
</P>
<P>
   ABC also aired the testimony in full, but employed a 5-second
delay which would have enabled the network to edit offensive or
graphic material, said spokeswoman Eileen Murphy. It wasn't
necessary, but anchor Peter Jennings repeatedly warned viewers
about the tapes contents, she said. CBS played it even safer, and
used a 30-second taped delay.
</P>
<P>
   CNN's coverage which started at 7 a.m. _ more than two hours
before the tapes were released _ seemed to be taking a toll on
anchors trying to keep track of the network's cadre of field
reporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bernie and I have been at this awhile and we're both losing
it,'' said CNN anchor Judy Woodruff when co-host Bernard Shaw
flubbed a seque long after the tape had concluded.
</P>
<P>
   NBC Congressional reporter Joe Johns also had a difficult time
early in the morning, even though he appeared to be the first of
the journalistic pack to get his hands on the tape's supporting
documents. As he began reading excerpts, Johns suddenly disappeared
from the screen, and anchor Tom Brokaw explained later that the
network had suffered ``an electronic meltdown.''
</P>
<P>
   But not everyone on TV was having a Monica meltdown.
</P>
<P>
   In a cheesy bit of counter-programming on WAGA, talk show host
Sally Jesse Raphael aired a special segment that seemed to fit the
theme of the day: ``Office Affairs Exposed.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three days after the president spoke to the country
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House
intern told grand jurors that she had been in love with him up
until the minute he went on television and told the world that
their involvement was purely sexual. And where was his apology to
her?
</P>
<P>
   With prosecutors pressing her for more and more graphic detail,
she supplied it. And yet, she also said that although she was upset
and confused, she had no appetite for hurting the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a beautiful soul,'' she told the grand jurors
on August 20 in testimony released by Congress Monday. ``I just
thought he was just this incredible person, and when I looked at
him I saw a little boy. And I don't know what the truth is
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The country may not like Monica Lewinsky; a recent poll showed
that only 5 percent of Americans held a favorable view of her. But
grand jurors obviously did, urging her to forgive herself, forget
Linda Tripp and get on with her life in a court appearance that
often seemed more like a counseling session.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked about sex with the president, Ms. Lewinsky _
who asked the grand jury to call her Monica _ was so embarrassed
that she had to close her eyes and force herself to answer the
question. And with prosecutors pressing her to specify what body
parts went where, grand jurors seemed to become more and more
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of her testimony on Aug. 20, a juror asked her if
there was anything she wanted to add, and Ms. Lewinsky defended the
president while offering a blanket apology for her own behavior:
``I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I
was never promised a job for my silence. And that I'm sorry. I'm
really sorry for everything that's happened. And I hate Linda
Tripp,'' she said, and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Several grand jurors tried to comfort her. One told her, ``We've
all fallen short. We sin every day. I don't care whether it's
murder, whether it's affairs or whatever. And we get over that. You
ask forgiveness and you go on. So to let you know from here, you
have my forgiveness. Because we all fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   Several others agreed. One advised her to let go of her feelings
for Ms. Tripp, saying, ``Whatever goes around comes around.''
Again, others chimed in, with ``It comes around'' and ``It does.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before she was excused from the grand jury, the forewoman
told her, ``Basically what we wanted to leave with, because this
will probably be your last visit to us, I hope I'm not going to
have to do this any more and I hope you won't have to come here any
more, but we wanted to offer you a bouquet of good wishes that
includes luck, success, happiness and blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   She again burst into tears and responded in kind, continuing the
lovefest: ``I appreciate all of your understanding for this
situation and your ability to open your heart and your mind and
your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony and evidence released by Congress Monday
frequently presented Ms. Lewinsky in terms that make it easy to see
why the grand jury responded the way they did.
</P>
<P>
   She is shown surrounded by federal agents in January at the Ritz
Carlton Hotel and berated by assistants to special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr who wanted her to testify against the president. They
threatened her with jail and made fun of her for wanting her
``mommy.'' (The evidence also makes clear that Ms. Lewinsky did her
part to lighten the load on the American taxpayer, paying for her
own dinner with the agents at Mozzarella's American Grill that
evening and even forking over $2 for coffee to the men who were
pressing her to wear a wire.)
</P>
<P>
   She had enough presence of mind to respond to the surprise
appearance of Starr's team with legal questions: If the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit went away, would she still be in legal
jeopardy? What if, theoretically speaking, she had not always told
Ms. Tripp the truth? She also thought to question the choice of her
father's friend and lawyer Bill Ginsburg as her attorney, worrying
because he was a medical malpractice lawyer inexperienced in
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when her mother, Marcia Lewis, finally did arrive, she
was clearly worried sick for her daughter, telling the Starr team
that Ms. Lewinsky had been suicidal six years earlier and was young
for her age. Ms. Lewinsky later said she had been on
antidepressants since early in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In all of her grand jury testimony, she comes across as
unfailingly loyal to the president, calling him her ``sexual
soulmate'' and saying of the affair, ``I think back on it, and he
always made me smile when I was with him. He was sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   And she defended the president in a number of ways, insisting,
for example, that he would never have had sex in the Oval Office
itself. When asked whether the president said she should deny a
relationship, she answered, ``I think I always offered that.''
</P>
<P>
   She even cut him a break on what she refers to as ``D-Day _ Dump
Day,'' the day the president broke off their affair, saying he was,
``just really wanting to do the right thing in God's eyes and do
the right thing for his family.''

</P>
<P>
   She is hard on herself in many ways, taking responsibility for
hectoring Clinton to get her a job, and presenting herself as so
pushy that she even dared suggest to the president what Hillary
Rodham Clinton should do to get him out of the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that first Mrs. Clinton should do something
publicly, maybe on a TV show or something, and talk about how
difficult the case had been for her and on her daughter and that
she just wished that he would settle it and it would go away. And
then the president should unannounced and unexpectedly go into the
briefing room'' and say that against his lawyers' advice, he had
decided to pay Mrs. Jones whatever she wanted just to get it over
with.
</P>
<P>
   She does defend herself on such subjects as why she kept the
blue dress stained with the president's semen. Ms. Tripp, she said,
suggested that she keep it as evidence. And when Ms Lewinsky
refused, Ms. Tripp told her she looked fat in it, so she never wore
it again, and didn't get around to having it cleaned. She says she
wore ``the infamous beret'' as the result of a bad-hair day.
</P>
<P>
   In her first grand jury appearance on Aug. 6, prosecutors were
much more willing to settle for a general description of what
occurred between the president and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By the Aug. 20 appearance, however, when prosecutors were
obviously matching Ms. Lewinsky's responses to the president's
grand jury testimony in an attempt to prove perjury, they were
asking such questions as, ``Were there times when the president
would touch you either on the breasts or in the genital area
directly to the skin or was it always through clothing?''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors seemed more interested in understanding Ms.
Lewinsky's motivations. One asked, ``Was it love or sexual
obsession?'' (She answered that it was both, but ``more love.'')
Another asked if she had truly believed ``anything real could have
come from this relationship''? (``Oh, yes.'')
</P>
<P>
   And when she grew embarrassed, they were sorry for her. One
suggested that she try closing her eyes again, and another said,
``We won't look at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky responded ``Can I hide under the table? I had ...
and wanted ... I tried to ... I placed his genital next to mine and
I hoped that if he ... oh, this is too embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the last questions put to her was whether she for any
reason would want to hurt the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``I'm upset with him right now, but no, that's
the last thing in the world I want to do.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally the anchors and pundits fell silent, the tape
rolled, a fuzzy image of President Clinton came on the screens, and
...
</P>
<P>
   And most people continued doing what they were doing on a mild
morning in a city slowed somewhat by the Jewish new year holiday.
When they did pause to watch, whether in a cafe, in an electronics
shop or on the screens at the News Corp. building on 48th and
Sixth, it was often with fatigue, shame and a distinct dollop of
sympathy for a man being painfully humiliated before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, what a screwball, what a sick man,'' muttered Albert
Navarrate, a jeweler from Queens, more in sadness than in anger,
after a particularly legalistic riff by Clinton outside News Corp.
``I mean he's a good president, he just screwed up. But children
shouldn't be exposed to this,'' he added, as the words ``oral sex''
echoed from the screen and flashed by again and again on the
electric ribbon above.
</P>
<P>
   Like Navarrate, most people listened a few minutes and moved on.
The shock value had long worn off, and everyone knew that the
testimony would be shown again and again all day, that the ordeal
was far from over. When a reporter approached one man and explained
that he was trolling for comments, the man wagged his head in
sympathy: ``Oh, I feel sorry for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have already made up their minds, and what they're
seeing is only reinforcing their opinions,'' said the man, Thomas
Karle, a lawyer with McGraw Hill from Wilton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion? ``I'm an attorney, and I view perjury and the
ability of the courts to punish it as the basis of law. It's all
sex and juicy, but it's still perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement home in Seattle, residents expressed a grudging
respect for Clinton, at his ability to maintain control under hours
of questioning, but they also expressed a clear sadness that the
country was being put through such a spectacle. ``We live in a
different world these days, I guess,'' said Nancy Cadley, 77, a
retired nurse who served in a medical unit in World War II and the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   On the campus of Emory University in Atlanta, a group of six
students, who already had strong opinions on Clinton before the
video was released, saw its airing as just more embarrassment
heaped on the man, his office, and the nation he leads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in New York, by far the more common reaction was sympathy
and even support for the president. Not absolution, certainly not
approval for what everyone agreed was gross and silly behavior, but
a sense that the public humiliation was out of all proportion to
his human weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad and cruel that he should go through this, that all
this should be made public,'' said a woman in her 30s. ``I don't
understand where they get the right to release this. It's
incredibly wrong. I mean, if the grand jury sat us all down and
asked about that topic, sex, how many people wouldn't commit
perjury?'' As if to punctuate the point, the woman resolutely
refused to give her name or job.
</P>
<P>
   In an admittedly unscientific sampling of street opinion, women
seemed more apt to show sympathy for the president than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political analysis I'm hearing during the breaks in the
coverage is contrary to my opinion,'' declared Joan Gilbert, a
public relations specialist. ``I am very sympathetic to Clinton. I
think he's being harassed and I think he is handling himself with
great diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's apologized, hasn't he?'' said a woman waiting for a
flight at Newark Airport, who said she was 80 and gave her name
only as Anna. ``He's been a good president. I'm sick of it. It's
his own personal business what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, Deborah Campbell, a corrections officer from Queens,
echoed the sentiment over breakfast at Sylvia's Restaurant. ``In my
eyes it really doesn't matter. It's his personal life, and he's
doing a great job,'' she said. ``It shouldn't be shown on TV _ but
since it is, New Yorkers want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all did. Dominic Romero, a chauffeur from White Plains, said
he was listening to the testimony only because he had nothing
better to do while waiting in his car outside the Colony Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired of this,'' he said. ``I'm so disgusted with
Republicans and Democrats that I'm going to vote for a third party
next time. We've got no leader. We're the laughing stock of the
whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those few who took a stern position toward the president,
like the attorney Karle, the usual reason was the public lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton just dissembles too much,'' said David Pocock, a
music-festival director who watched the testimony at Newark Airport
while waiting for a flight to Indianapolis. ``When you see him on
television like this, it's just remarkable how smooth and slick he
can be. He's been too smooth and too slick for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the drama on the screen, there was no sense across the
city that life had stopped, or even slowed, for the four-hour
broadcast. A random check of smokers outside office buildings
suggested that the only major obstacle to business-as-usual was the
Jewish holiday and the streets closed in midtown because of
Clinton's presence at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too busy watching the market go down to watch the
president go down,'' said Bill Takos, while taking a break for a
smoke outside the Oscar Gruss brokerage.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Fifth Avenue nearby, Peter Katz was checking his window
display at the Alfred Dunhill shop. ``Watch TV? Of course not. I'm
at work,'' he declared with a note of indignation. ``I think when
you look at everything we're read and seen, the American public
would just as soon see the whole scenario end. It's not what the
American people want.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Borders book store on Fifth Avenue, signs everywhere
proclaimed, ``The Starr Report Is Here.'' But the latest
installment of the Clinton saga was not there. The television at
the espresso bar was showing another video, said John Hinte, a
manager at the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself get information overload from the whole inquiry, the
whole rigmarole,'' he said. ``I'm a little overwhelmed by all this
information.'' But the Starr report, he admitted, was selling quite
briskly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wiz, a large electronics store on Third Avenue, a wall of
television screens was showing an action movie. Only one 9-inch
screen at the end of the row was tuned, badly, to President
Clinton. ``The manager didn't want a crowd in here,'' explained a
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three people watching, only one said he had actually
dropped in for a quick gulp of testimony _ in the hope, he said, of
seeing Clinton get angry. ``We've had very few opportunities to see
Clinton showing strong emotions, and I read in The New York Times
that the tape could show that side of Clinton,'' explained Roberto
Sarmento, a manager of business planning with Philip Morris. He ran
out of time before Clinton got angry, but he said his wife was
taping the entire appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The manager at the Electronic Factory in the Bronx took the
opposite tack and tuned all his television sets to the president's
testimony. ``It's been on all morning, but customers aren't
interested,'' said the manager, J.D. Sabatt. ``Who cares? I've been
looking at his facial expressions, but really, it's because it's
the only channel that comes in clear.'' By noon, Sabatt said, he
had yet to sell a single set.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent refrain in the streets was concern that children were
being exposed to all the frank sex talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's interesting that whoever chose to release these
tapes chose the time when every child in America would be home from
school for the Jewish holiday,'' said Jeanne Pedro, watching the
testimony at her home in Mamaroneck. ``I don't think it's necessary
for children to be listening to conversations about oral sex and
intercourse.''
</P>
<P>
   But few adults themselves seemed shocked by what they heard, at
least not any more.
</P>
<P>
   On the TV at a coffee shop in Newark Airport, the president was
being questioned about where his secretary was during a visit from
Monica Lewinsky, when an elderly woman turned around and said for
all to hear, ``President Kennedy did worse!''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he seems sincere and actually appealing,'' said Ruth
Finn, 78, a retired real-estate salesperson from Rye, after
watching the first two hours of testimony. ``Also, I don't see so
far what's so raunchy and graphic about this. Dan Rather gave a
warning at the outset, but so far, it seems fairly tame. The
average MTV video is far, far worse in terms of raunch and bad
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a psychological point of view, it's fascinating to see so
private a side of so public a person. His reactions, his responses
_ we're seeing something we're never seen before in a president.
It's really a historical moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a drug,'' said Howard Enders, a professor of writing
at Purchase College. ``It keys into our own need to face the dark
side of ourselves _ if, indeed, we have to face it. Everyone says
they're sick of it, and then they go and watch it. We're watching a
drama unfold, a tragedy of Greek proportions. As I watched,'' he
added, ``I felt sympathy for Clinton.''

   Celebrity doctor/philosopher/spiritual adviser  &UR; Deepak Chopra &LR; 
is calling himself only  &UR; Deepak  &LR; on ``The Gift of Love,'' an album
to be released in November by Rasa Records.
</P>
<P>
   According to a report in New York magazine, the album is billed
as a ``musical tribute to the act of love,'' and features
contributions from  &UR; Madonna &LR; ,  &UR; Demi Moore &LR; ,  &UR; Debra Winger &LR; ,
 &UR; Blythe &LR; 
 &UR; Danner &LR; ,  &UR; Goldie Hawn &LR;  and  &UR; Martin Sheen &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   They will be reading the poetry of the 13th century Persian
mystic  &UR; Rumi &LR;  while a beat plays in the background to create the
``experience of ecstasy.'' Deepak says this will fill the ``missing
love'' voice in people's lives.

   A barmaid said she was there, and Australian TV and newspapers
ran a grainy shot of a dark-haired woman in the tropical resort of
Port Douglas, Australia, on Friday, setting off a media hunt for
 &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; , who was said to be visiting somebody or other
who may or may not have been there. She wasn't.

   Meanwhile, the Washington Post reports that five publishers have
been approached about a book by the former White House intern, and
their reactions have ranged from nope to maybe. ``I'm as big a
whore as anyone,'' one publisher said, ``but I'd rather die
first.''

I guess they matched the forks she had at home. The restaurant was
Longley's cafeteria. ... Anne had already impressed me by offering
to go Dutch treat, but when I saw her sticking that silverware in
her purse I was really excited, and I guess a little scared....
</P>
<P>
   ``When she invited me over to her place for a spaghetti dinner,
which was our next date, I was pleased to see the little `L' on the
spoons and knives, but I still made no comment. ... I think I fell

WASHINGTON STATE'S $5.7B TOBACCO SUIT ABOUT TO BEGIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE MILETICH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Jury selection begins Tuesday in a $5.7 billion
lawsuit against the tobacco industry as Washington becomes the
fifth state to try to recover medical costs to treat the poor for
smoking-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   None of the previous cases in Texas, Florida, Mississippi and
Minnesota made it to a jury. All were settled for billions of
dollars.
</P>
<P>
   But the legal landscape has shifted in the tobacco companies'
favor since they settled with Minnesota in May.
</P>
<P>
   A national tobacco agreement collapsed in Congress and cigarette
makers have won a string of victories in smaller cases around the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Washington, tobacco lawyers won the right for the first
time to use a new legal weapon to defend themselves: putting the
state on trial by portraying it as a partner in cigarette sales.
</P>
<P>
   They will argue that the state's licensing of cigarettes and
collection of millions of dollars in tobacco taxes undercuts its
case.
</P>
<P>
   The arrangement has allowed Washington to collect far more in
tax revenues than it has spent on health costs, according to
tobacco lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will put on evidence the state has profited . . . from the
sale of tobacco products, even if one assumes the states incurred
the health-care expenses it incurred,'' said James Milliman, an
attorney for one of the defendants, Brown &AMP; Williamson.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997 alone, the state collected $270 million more in tobacco
taxes than it paid out in Medicaid costs, Milliman said. Washington
collects 82.5 cents in excise taxes _ one of the highest rates in
the nation _ on each pack of cigarettes, which sells for about
$3.20 plus sales tax.
</P>
<P>
   But that argument may never come before a jury. Even as
Washington state prepares to go to trial, its attorneys and those
from 37 other states continue to seek a negotiated settlement with
some cigarette producers in talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever comes of those talks, state lawyers dismiss the tobacco
industry's latest legal salvo.
</P>
<P>
   No one, they note, should be rewarded for illegal conduct
because they are a taxpayer. To do so would be like rewarding a
motorist who refuses to pay a speeding ticket because he also pays
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, they will focus on testimony from former tobacco
company insiders and on stacks of internal industry documents that
they claim show that cigarette makers conspired for decades to hide
health hazards of their products from smokers.
</P>
<P>
   They also will attempt to prove that the companies targeted
children with sophisticated marketing campaigns and sought to hook
consumers by manipulating the nicotine levels in cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   The state, which filed suit two years ago, is seeking
reimbursement for $3 billion in Medicaid and insurances costs
related to tobacco illnesses. Jurors also could award $2.7 million
in punitive damages and possibly more.
</P>
<P>
   The suit also asks that the tobacco industry be directed to
issue broader warnings about the health risks of their products,
take steps to prevent minors from obtaining cigarettes and halt
deceptive and unfair advertising practices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our case is based on marketing to kids, the intentional
withholding of adverse affects, that they lied and a conspiracy not
to market safe products,'' said the state's lead attorney, John
Hough, a veteran assistant attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   In response, tobacco lawyers will deny the allegations, arguing
that state officials have known for years about the risks
associated with smoking, particularly since the surgeon general's
1964 warning on the dangers of smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Hough said the state won't spend a lot of time trying to prove
that tobacco is harmful because most people already know that.
</P>
<P>
   Milliman said the companies won't deny the risks of smoking, but
will adhere to their longstanding claim that no link has been
scientifically proven.
</P>
<P>
   But before 12 jurors begin to hear testimony, the scope and
shape of the case could be altered, depending on the outcome of the
settlement talks in New York.
</P>
<P>
   The talks include Philip Morris, the nation's largest cigarette
maker with brands such as Marlboro and Virginia Slims, whose
actions often set the agenda for the industry. Also participating
is Lorillard Tobacco Co., the fourth-largest cigarette maker.
</P>
<P>
   Two other major manufacturers, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. and
Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco Corp., have declined to join in the
negotiations and vowed to defend themselves against the suits.
</P>
<P>
   But both have left open their options, raising the possibility
they could be part of a settlement. The two companies joined with
other tobacco makers in the $6.6 billion deal struck with
Minnesota, just before that state's case was to go to the jury.
</P>
<P>
   Against that backdrop, the long-awaited trial in the Washington
case began gearing up Sept. 14 with pretrial maneuvering in King
County Superior Court.
</P>
<P>
   The 9th-floor courtroom _ the largest in the King County
Courthouse _ is normally used for pretrial matters but was set
aside for the tobacco case to accommodate about a dozen attorneys
on each side and the throngs of spectators expected for the
proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   It has been wired with video equipment, a big screen and
computers for multimedia presentations. Two large speakers have
been placed in front of the gallery.
</P>
<P>
   Each side also has been assigned a ``war room'' in the
courthouse to house files and provide extra room for additional
attorneys.
</P>
<P>
   Yet until now, with the questioning of prospective jurors about
to begin, there has been little sparring in the courtroom, except
for some last-minute legal wrangling.
</P>
<P>
   Although a lull isn't unusual before a major trial gains speed,
the lack of activity has contributed to widespread speculation that
some sort of multistate deal will be struck soon.
</P>
<P>
   Late last week, lawyers for the tobacco companies asked for a
one-month delay of the trial, arguing that a settlement involving
some of the defendants could prejudice those who remain in the
case.
</P>
<P>
   State attorneys objected and King County Superior Court Judge
George Finkle, who is presiding over the case, denied the motion
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, cigarette makers agreed to pay $38.5 billion to
settle with Minnesota, Texas, Florida and Mississippi. Except in
the Minnesota case, deals were struck before trials.
</P>
<P>
   As of 1996, the tobacco industry's gross sales were listed as
$45 billion annually, and the payouts cover a 25-year period.
</P>
<P>
   Since those deals, the tobacco industry has scored several court
victories.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a Florida appeals court overturned a $1 million verdict
against Brown &AMP; Williamson brought by the family of a smoker who
died from lung cancer. Judges in several states have dismissed
labor union cases seeking reimbursement for health costs associated
with tobacco illnesses. And a federal judge in North Carolina ruled
that a 1993 Environmental Protection Agency study overstated the
proven link between secondhand smoke and cancer.
</P>
<P>
   The industry's decision to portray Washington state as a partner
in cigarettes sales also reflects its new confidence. Finkle ruled
that the companies may use the tax issue as a defense, something
they weren't allowed to do in the earlier cases. But Finkle
reserved a ruling on whether the argument can be applied to
damages.
</P>
<P>
   A victory in the Washington case would give cigarettes makers
leverage in the other state suits.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies also risk the first adverse verdict in a state
tobacco suit.
</P>
<P>
   As a matter of law, a verdict in Washington's favor could be
applied to all or some of the pending cases on liability, leaving
only damages to be decided in each suit.
</P>
<P>
   Milliman, the Brown &AMP; Williamson attorney, calls that
possibility remote because of what he describes as the ``unique''
consumer fraud and antitrust claims incorporated in Washington's
case.
</P>
<P>
   But the pending suits generally mirror those filed in Washington
and the other four states that reached settlement. Each has
contended under various legal theories that they were defrauded of
Medicaid and insurance costs for tobacco-related illnesses.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Washington's case will follow what occurred in the
Minnesota trial, where state attorneys produced reams of internal
industry documents to buttress allegations that cigarette makers
deceived the public.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there will be some new twists. For the first time in a
tobacco case, the state plans to call a former lawyer for the
Liggett Group, a cigarette maker that broke with the industry. In a
settlement with 21 states, including Washington, the company agreed
to waive attorney-client privilege, provide documents to settle
state tobacco lawsuits and pay about $25 million, plus 2.5 percent
of its pretax profits over the next 25 years.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence Meyer, who advised Liggett in the 1970s and 1980s, is
prepared to testify that the company was pressured by other major
cigarette makers to drop development of a safer cigarette, which it
did.
</P>
<P>
   Industry officials feared ``Liggett's sale and marketing of a
safer cigarette could result in infinite liability in civil
litigation as it would constitute a direct or implied admission
that all other cigarettes were unsafe,'' according to a proffer
submitted by Meyer's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Milliman downplayed the significance of Meyer's assertions,
saying test marketing of a safer cigarette that heated rather than
burned tobacco was a huge flop.
</P>
<P>
   But Hough, the state attorney, said the industry has never
mounted a strong marketing campaign for a safer cigarette.
</P>
<P>
   The trial is expected to last three to five months.

<P>
   It was political theater of the purest sort, adapted for the age
of video. And there was little doubt, watching Bill Clinton's grand
jury testimony, that he knew he was making a movie. Refusing to
provide sexually explicit details, he said, ``I am right to answer
all the questions about perjury, but not to say things which will
be forever in the historical annals of the United States because of
this unprecedented videotape, and may be leaked at any time.''
</P>
<P>
   This videotape broke many of the rules of film and television,
and it was all the more fascinating for those lapses. Most notable
was the way it violated a Hollywood truism: Films are made, broken
and often saved in the editing room. The unedited nature and the
static, mid-distance camera focused on the president, were what
made the testimony so exceptional as television. To watch it in a
four-hour-plus gulp, as it was presented by the all-news cable
channels, brought the tremendous relief of having the spinners on
both sides finally be quiet. Here, at last, was a chance to see
Clinton and the prosecutors go mano-a-mano.
</P>
<P>
   It was decidedly Clinton's show. Alone on camera, he had the
advantage over his several questioners, with their disembodied
voices. In a situation he didn't control, his was a high-wire act
of improvisation, however well-coached he might have been.
</P>
<P>
   And after a tight-lipped start, he seemed to warm up and give a
vehement, even gripping, performance. Addressing two conflicting
audiences, the prosecutors and the public, at times he assumed the
role of lawyer in his own defense and just as frequently appeared
to be the speech-making politician. Above all, he was the Bill
Clinton who knows how to play to the camera.
</P>
<P>
   However cinematic the situation, though, it was also unique. No
movie analogy quite fits, though several near-matches came
fleetingly to mind. The tape had an unlikely resemblance to ``My
Dinner with Andre,'' with its small scale, back-and-forth
conversation, and observations that seemed positively ruminative.
``You're dealing with, in some ways, the most mysterious area of
human life,'' Clinton said about the ``he said, she said'' aspect
of sexual behavior. (The testimony's details were so intimate that
the tape came with on-screen warnings about graphic content.) ``My
Dinner With Andre,'' of course, is far too benign a model to suit
the combative nature of the prosecutors' questions and Clinton's
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The tape had qualities of cinema verite, turning viewers into
eavesdroppers in that inherently false situation, as the subjects
usually pretended not to notice the cameras. But most documentaries
don't unfold in real time the way this did.
</P>
<P>
   What the Clinton tape decidedly did not resemble was a courtroom
drama old or new (neither ``Witness for the Prosecution'' nor ``Law
and Order''). The setting, in the Map Room of the White House,
guaranteed that the president looked like a president, not a
witness on the stand. The bowl of flowers visible over his left
shoulder onscreen would reappear later that night, when the
president gave an address from the same room. That visual echo made
the grand jury tape seem like a prequel, explaining why Clinton
sounded so angry at Kenneth Starr in that speech.
</P>
<P>
   Though the tape was abundantly excerpted, only in the full
four-hour version was it possible to see a dramatic structure
taking shape. Clinton appeared tight-lipped, almost ashen at the
start, putting on his glasses to read a statement that made it
clear he would not provide sexual details. His eyes were turned
down as he and the prosecutors wrangled about the definition of
sex, but he remembered to look directly into the camera when
saying, ``I regret'' the involvement with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Gaining energy, he spoke with more conviction than any of his
surrogates had when doing the linguistic acrobatics that are his
legal defense against perjury, explaining why ``sexual relations''
does not mean oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   Soon he was taking every opportunity to get his political
message beyond the grand jury to the big wide world he assumed
would one day watch. The Paula Jones sexual harassment case was
``funded by my political opponents,'' and has since been tossed out
of court, he noted more than once.
</P>
<P>
   By the third hour his performance had peaked and a viewer's eyes
tended to glaze over (a common third-act letdown). Clinton's
refrain was ``I don't remember,'' his answers were more evasive and
the questions more repetitive.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the day and on the evening new programs, excerpts of
the testimony were played, and it became easy to predict what they
would be. There was the president's opening statement; there was
his most vehement moment, when he glared and gestured with his
hands and said of the Jones lawyers, ``I deplored what they were
doing''; there were pieces of the wrangling about what he told his
secretary, Betty Currie; there was the president calling Ms.
Lewinsky ``a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   But through it all, the winding routes offered revealing details
and unrehearsed moments all too likely to be left on the cutting
room floor in the news reports. You can see the president trying to
stay calm when asked persistently about whether Ms. Lewinsky ``said
she loved you'' in a note.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton raises an eyebrow and offers the hint of a smile when
saying, ``Ms. Lewinsky has a way of getting information out of
people when she's either charming or determined.'' That eyebrow
alone could be subjected to hours of debate. It looked as if the
memory of her attractions was passing through his mind, but maybe
he was just calling her a flirt.
</P>
<P>
   And he actually recoiled at the most explicit question, about
whether he had used ``a sexual object.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton didn't remember giving Ms. Lewinsky ``cherry
chocolates'' as a gift, but did recall giving her a Rockettes
blanket that he'd had for a couple of years. In such pathetically
revealing details was a real-life movie told by one of the two
people who knows it whole.

MALAYSIAN POLICE BREAK UP PROTESTS ON ARREST  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH MYDANS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Acting to quell the biggest show of
dissent faced by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad in his 17 years in
office, riot police officers fired tear gas and water cannon on
Monday to disperse thousands of people protesting the arrest of his
former deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Federal police said the former deputy, Anwar Ibrahim, 51, who
was arrested late Sunday, was being held under the Internal
Security Act, which allows the indefinite imprisonment without
charges or trial of people deemed to be a threat to national
security.
</P>
<P>
   The street protests on Monday suggested the extent of Anwar's
popularity as a more liberal foil to Mahathir, 72, who has imposed
an autocratic style of rule.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several days _ and up to an hour before his arrest
_ Anwar had gathered huge crowds to hear him denounce the man he
previously called his father and his teacher.
</P>
<P>
   But diplomats and other analysts said they doubted that the
opposition posed a threat to the prime minister. He controls the
levers of government and continues to enjoy wide respect as the
creator of a modern Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Once he moved against Anwar, dismissing him on Sept. 2, almost
all public figures supported the action, even those who had been
longtime colleagues and allies of the deputy prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Though there were angry crowds in the streets on Monday, the
protests appeared to be diffuse and leaderless.
</P>
<P>
   The most eloquent complaint against Anwar's arrest came from his
wife, Azizah Ismail, who said: ``If Dr. Mahathir thinks that by
ordering the police to act like gangsters he will frighten the
people from supporting this reform movement, he is dreaming.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I feel very sad because Dr. Mahathir is a great
leader, but now he has become a political desperado who is willing
to suppress his own people just to keep power.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses said that at least 50 protesters were arrested and
that a number of others were injured as the police dispersed the
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   Even as tear gas drifted through the streets on Monday, Mahathir
maintained an air of smiling serenity as he played host to Queen
Elizabeth II of Britain, who arrived for a visit Sunday, and
presided over the closing ceremony of the Commonwealth Games.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, demonstrators ran after the queen's motorcade as
it passed them on the streets and she waved from the window.
</P>
<P>
   But the tens of thousands of people watching the closing
ceremony at the stadium dwarfed the numbers of protesters. In the
stands, they held up a huge sign reading: ``Thanks for the great
moments.''
</P>
<P>
   Anwar's lawyers have said that they expect him to be charged
with sexual misconduct after two of his male friends said, while in
custody, that he had sodomized them.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have also hinted that he might be charged with
sedition and disturbing public order after a series of large
rallies at which he called for Mahathir's removal.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations on both sides have been particularly harsh. It
had been an edgy but successful alliance of different generations
and political philosophies. Now, as in a bitter divorce, both men
have now found the most hurtful things to say about each other.
</P>
<P>
   In a sign of a continuing sweep against Anwar's supporters, a
seventh ally, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, head of the youth wing of the
ruling party, was arrested Monday. He was also charged under the
Internal Security Act.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests and charges appeared to be a particularly vigorous
form of politics by a leader who brooks no challenges. Foreign
diplomats said Anwar's real offense, in the eyes of the prime
minister, was forgetting his place as an obedient No. 2.
</P>
<P>
   As Malaysia's economy has collapsed over the last year, Anwar
has increasingly taken center stage in what seemed a sober contrast
to a leader viewed by some as eccentric and economically misguided.

 &HT;    Heart disease strikes fit, too
 &HT;    By Patricia Guthrie
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Athletes _ no matter how young, fit, fast or strong _
have a weak spot just like the rest of us.
</P>
<P>
   Their hearts.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Florence Griffith Joyner, 38, from an apparent
heart attack again offers proof, Atlanta-area cardiologists said
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being athletic absolutely does not prevent young people from
having heart disease. It can certainly occur in people in excellent
physical shape,'' said Dr. Randy Martin of the Emory Clinic and a
health reporter for WBS-TV.
</P>
<P>
   Because details had not been released, doctors were reluctant to
speculate on exactly what may have triggered her death.
</P>
<P>
   ``But sudden death from cardiac causes in younger people is not
unheard of,'' said Dr. Neal Scott, Emory Clinic cardiologist and
associate professor at Emory University.
</P>
<P>
   In general, cardiac deaths in people younger than 40 are caused
by a congenital condition, such as an irregular heart rhythm,
sudden infection or hardening of the arteries. Griffith Joyner
joins the names of Hank Gathers, Reggie Lewis, Flo Hyman and Sergei
Grinkov, all top athletes felled by sudden cardiac events at the
top of their game _ and in some cases, while playing their game.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers (1990) and Lewis (1993) were basketball players believed
to have died from myocarditis, an inflammation of the heart
muscle.Hyman, a top U.S. Olympic volleyball team member, collapsed
during a game in 1986 when the main vessel carrying blood from her
heart to her body ruptured. She suffered from a condition called
Marfan's Syndrome. Grinkov, the Russian ice skating pairs partner
of his wife, died in 1995 from a severe blockage of his coronary
arteries. He had probably actually suffered a heart attack in the
previous 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Although the public may find it difficult to accept that even
the most finely tuned bodies are susceptible to heart attacks and
cardiovascular disease, doctors know athletes can be easily felled
by conditions of complicated names such as hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, the inherited condition causing irregular heart
rhythm. They also know that all of the exercise on earth does not
make one immune from clogged arteries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We worry a lot about athletes if they develop chest pain,''
said Martin. ``Just as with anyone else, it can be a sign of
something very serious.''

 &HT;    Track world crushed by news of death
 &HT;    By Mike Fish and Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The news struck Sandra Farmer-Patrick like the death
of a relative. She couldn't believe her former mentor and friend,
Florence Griffith Joyner, was dead. Not at 38. Certainly not of a
bad heart.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe she's in a coma,'' Farmer-Patrick had told her husband,
David. ``Finally, when I saw it on CNN, it hit me. I just lost it.
I started screaming. My body was, like, paralyzed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were like sisters. We had trained together, gone to (UCLA)
together, roomed together. I competed for her track team, FloJo
International, for a couple years. Here is this wonderful, young,
healthy person. How could this happen?''
</P>
<P>
   That was the question in the minds of the track and field world
as it coped Monday with the sudden death of the unparalleled female
sprinter, the woman who stole the Seoul Olympic spotlight with a
rare combination of fashion and record-smashing speed.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow athletes and officials remembered her long, colorful
fingernails, her stylish hair, her stunning bodysuits _ especially
the purple one with a turquoise bikini brief over it and only her
right leg covered. She had referred to the outfit as a
``one-legger.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She got me to wear the one-legger, and then she helped me
design a little skirt thing that I wore,'' Farmer-Patrick recalled.
``She stepped out and said, `Let's try and have some prominence.'''
</P>
<P>
   Antonio McKay of Atlanta, a teammate on the 1984 and '88 Olympic
teams, said she sold the sport unlike few other athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing you think about is beauty,'' McKay said. ``She
was such a beautiful person. She was real nice, but yet quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``In track and field, it's so tough to have a female role model.
Evelyn Ashford was great with that, but then FloJo came along and
was real flashy, but real quiet. She was so powerful and so fast,
but when she spoke, it wasn't `I'm this and I'm that.' She let her
running do most of the speaking.''
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kingdom, the 110-meter hurdles gold medalist in Seoul,
remembered being awed by a Griffith Joyner performance three months
before the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We joked around about who was going to break the world record
first,'' Kingdom said. ``So I bet her 20 bucks. It was a friendly
bet, really, but every time I'd see her, she'd point her finger at
me and ask about the 20 bucks.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner attempted a comeback in 1992 as a distance
runner but failed to make an impact. Four years later, she signed
up for the Olympic trials but did not appear.
</P>
<P>
   Other reaction from friends, rivals and peers:
</P>
<P>
   _ ``What Florence brought to track was a flash and a flair that
we didn't have, which was probably good for the sport and got
attention for us,'' said Ashford, an Olympic sprint gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``People are still trying to catch the records she set more
than 10 years ago. It's an amazing legacy. Many have tried and all
have failed in terms of her records,'' said Carl Lewis, a nine-time
Olympic gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She had speed even back then. She was very focused. I used
to race against her and she smoked me,'' said Will Burnett,
football coach at Jordan High in south Los Angeles, where he and
Griffith Joyner were classmates.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She was a role model for girls and young women in sports,''
said Bill Hybl, U.S. Olympic Committee president.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``She was very, very determined. There was no impossibility to
anything. She really tried to live that,'' said Jeanette Bolden,
1984 Olympic relay gold medalist and UCLA women's head track and
field coach.
</P>
<P>
   _ ``The beauty of her was that she never changed. She was the
same FloJo before (she became a star) and she was the same FloJo
after,'' said track coach John Smith.
</P>
<P>
   Atlantan Derrick Adkins, the 400-meter hurdles champion at the
1996 Olympics, best summed up the sport's reaction: ``It's just a
very sad tragedy.''

 &HT;    Steroid rumors will haunt sprinter
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Even in death, Florence Griffith Joyner could not
escape the steroid question.
</P>
<P>
   Her incredible showing at the 1988 U.S. Olympic Trials and Seoul
Games, coupled with her abrupt retirement before the advent of
mandatory random drug testing the following year, long fueled
suspicions in the track and field community about her indelible
marks.
</P>
<P>
   To this day, some performers, officials, media members and the
public have questioned whether she used performance-enhancing
drugs. ``It's offensive to look on the Internet and see stuff like
that today,`` Sandra Farmer Patrick, a close friend of the sprinter
and an Olympic hurdler, said Monday. ``This is a sad time.``
</P>
<P>
   FloJo passed drug tests at the trials and the Olympics in Seoul.
But seven years later, when she was elected to the National Track
and Field Hall of Fame, she finished only fifth on the ballot and
secured the minimium number of votes for election _ shockingly low
for the greatest female sprinter who still owns the 100- and
200-meter world records.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really don't concern myself with that,`` Griffith Joyner
said at the induction ceremony in Atlanta. ``I'm blessed to have
been chosen.``
</P>
<P>
   What pained her more, she said, were comments from some sprint
rivals linking her retirement after the Seoul Games to the
introduction of out-of-competition testing.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say that I disappeared (for that reason) is such a
ridiculous thing,`` she said.
</P>
<P>
   But news of her death again raised the issue.
</P>
<P>
   When he was informed the cause of her death, Antonio McKay,
FloJo's 1984 and 1988 Olympic teammate, said he became concerned
people would link it to the effects of steroids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hoping it was a car accident,'' McKay said. ``Being in
sports as long as I've been in there, knowing that people cheat,
you hope (any steroid use) had nothing to do with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wish it had been any other (cause of) death besides that.
The first thing I hear on ESPN is about steroids.''
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Ashford, the runner-up in Seoul and the sprint queen
before Griffith Joyner, spoke thoughtfully Monday of closure to the
lingering drug suspicions out of respect for Griffith Joyner but
indicated she is uncertain about their validity.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's true, maybe it will come out now,`` she said. ``If it
isn't, then maybe that will come out, too. Maybe the secret has
been buried with her.
</P>
<P>
   ``The saddest thing is after all she has done ... it will always
be a question. The asterisk will always be there. That is the
saddest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlanta sprinter Gwen Torrence could not be reached for comment.
The Olympian has railed against drug use among her peers and has
expressed suspicion about Griffith Joyner's records but never
directly accused her.

FLORENCE GRIFFITH JOYNER, 38; FLASHY SPRINTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BARBARA HUEBNER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner, the stunning sprinter whose one-legged
track suits and flashy fingernails remain as etched in memory as
her two world records and three gold medals, died Monday at her
home is Mission Viejo, Calif. She was 38.
</P>
<P>
   The Orange County sheriff's office said a 911 call was received
early Monday morning from her husband, Al Joyner, who reported his
wife was ``unresponsive and not breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``She had passed away during the night,'' said spokesman Lt.
Hector Rivera. An autopsy was scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Foster, the three-time world champion in the 100-meter
hurdles and a longtime friend of Griffith Joyner, said she suffered
an apparent heart seizure, although the official cause of death has
not been determined. Despite being hospitalized overnight two years
ago after suffering a seizure while on a flight from St. Louis to
California, Foster said, she had shown no subsequent signs of heart
problems and had not been in ill health.
</P>
<P>
   Foster was told of the death by Griffith Joyner's sister-in-law,
Jackie Joyner-Kersee, who with her husband Bobby rushed to
California when they heard the news.
</P>
<P>
   Her family was one of talent and fame: Joyner-Kersee's brother,
Al, married Florence Griffith in 1987. Besides Griffith Joyner's
five Olympic medals, Al Joyner was the 1984 Olympic triple-jump
gold medalist, while Jackie Joyner-Kersee won six Olympic medals in
the high jump and heptathlon before retiring this summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent, and
captivated by her style,'' said President Clinton after learning of
her death. ``Though she rose to the pinnacle of the world of
sports, she never forgot where she came from, devoting time and
resources to helping children -- especially those growing up in our
most devastated neighborhoods -- make the most of their own
talents.''
</P>
<P>
   It was 10 years ago this week that Griffith Joyner won triple
gold in the 100-meter dash, 200-meter dash and and as part of the
4x100-meter relay in the 1988 Olympics in Seoul. She barely missed
a fourth gold medal when the 4x400 team finished second.
</P>
<P>
   The world records she set en route -- an amazing 10.49 in the
100 at the Olympic Trials followed by an astounding 21.34 in the
200 at the Olympics themselves -- not only made her the fastest
woman ever, but have yet to be seriously challenged despite the
spectacular rise of Marion Jones, whose times of 10.65 and 21.62
this year are as close as anyone has come in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost one of the great track and field athletes in
history,'' said Foster.
</P>
<P>
   Although later known simply as ``FloJo,'' she was born Delorez
(cq) Florence Griffith on Dec. 21, 1959. Raised with her 10
brothers and sisters in a housing project in Watts, a rough section
of Los Angeles, the youngster was competing in, and winning, the
50- and 70-meter dashes at the Sugar Ray Robinson Youth Foundation
by the time she was seven. By 1973, she had one the first of two
consecutive Jesse Owens National Youth Games.
</P>
<P>
   But that didn't prevent her from finding time to pursue her
other love: playing dress-up, experimenting with hairstyles, trying
out the concept of wearing one color kneesock on one leg and a
different color on the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd put on my own clothes and turn them this way and that,''
Griffith Joyner said in a Los Angeles Times interview in 1988. She
would smash crayons into her nail polish, seeking a more
more-dramatic look. If she couldn't afford, or even find, the
clothes she wanted, she would design and sew them herself.
</P>
<P>
   By the time she started running for California State University
at Northridge, it was obvious that Griffith Joyner had a flair for
both fashion and speed. What she didn't have was money, and when
she ran out she quit school and went to work as a bank teller.
Kersee, her track coach at Northridge, got her back into college
with financial aid, and she followed him to UCLA when he got a job
there in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   That year, Griffith Joyner almost made the Olympic team at 200
meters; in 1982 she won the NCAA championship at that distance and
the next year won again, this time at 400. It was all a buildup to
making the team for the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles, where she ran
for a silver medal in the 200 behind teammate Valerie Brisco.
</P>
<P>
   Disappointed with her second-place finish, Griffith Joyner went
back to work for a bank during the day, working in the evenings as
a hairdresser and nail stylist. Her training fell off, and she
began to gain weight. But she never gave up, and with the support
of her new boyfriend, Al Joyner, she struggled to get back into
shape. Knowing that her reaction time out of the blocks had always
been a weak point, she watched tapes of sprinter Ben Johnson's
takeoff out of the blocks and Carl Lewis's relaxed style. She hit
the weights, the fire rekindled as she sharpened her focus on
Seoul.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was very, very determined,'' said Jeanette Bolden, a
teammate at UCLA and now women's track coach there. ``There was no
impossibility to anything.''
</P>
<P>
   In her quarterfinal heat of the 100 at the 1988 Olympic Trials
in Indianapolis -- wearing a purple body suit with the left leg cut
off, topped by a pair of turquoise bikini briefs -- Griffith
Joyner's 10:49 shattered the world record. Then, a few months
later, she captivated the rest of the world with her Olympic
triumphs and dazzling track suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``What Florence brought to track was a flash and a flair that we
didn't have, which was probably good for the sport and got
attention for us,'' said Evelyn Ashford, one of her competitors and
herself an Olympic sprint gold medalist.
</P>
<P>
   The combination helped cement her as one of the most-recognized
female athletes ever. ``She had that rare combination of glamor,
individuality and being a gold medalist, a champion,'' Donna
Lopiano, executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation, said
Monday of the 1998 nominee for the foundation's prestigious
International Hall of Fame. ``She reinvented the track and field
uniform for women. It seemed like she invented the designer
fingernail, and with a gold medal that's a pretty potent
combination.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner's melding of speed and style ``repopularized
track and field among young girls,'' said Lopiano. ``At a time you
were looking for the next hero, there she came: not with the soft
steps of a Wilma Rudolph, but with a bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Her success, however, did not come without controversy. Even
after a decade, questions persist about the validity of wind gauge
at the Trials, which read 0.00 despite swirling winds recorded at
the same time elsewhere in the stadium; indeed, the 1998 track and
field annual puts an asterisk for ``probably strongly
wind-assisted'' next to the mark. And given the seemingly rapid
development of Griffith Joyner's muscular physique between 1984 and
1988, steroid rumors were probably unavoidable.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know what the rumors are about me, and they are not true,''
she once said. ``I have never used drugs, I will never use drugs
and I don't need to use drugs.'' The sprinter never failed a drug
test.
</P>
<P>
   In early 1989, without a single post-Olympic race, Griffith
Joyner retired to pursue endorsement opportunities and her dreams
of writing and acting. She designed a line of clothing for Starter,
marketed a line of artificial fingernails, recorded several popular
exercise videos and -- without question her proudest accomplishment
-- gave birth to a daughter, Mary, now 7.
</P>
<P>
   ``She always had her hand in on something to do with kids,''
said Foster, insisting she wasn't always as flashy as she looked.
``She was very quiet, very humble, not outgoing at all. She was a
homebody, more or less.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite flirtations with comebacks in the marathon and 400
meters over the past decade, Griffith Joyner's main contribution to
athletics since 1988 has been as co-chair since 1993 of the
President's Council on Physical Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence was ... a kind and caring human being, a model for
the youth of the world,'' remembered Craig Masback, chief executive
officer of USA Track &AMP; Field.
</P>
<P>
   Primo Nebiolo, head of the International Athletic Federation,
perhaps spoke for many when he said Monday: ``I will never forget
this extraordinary athlete who stunned the world in Seoul 10 years
ago with her amazing sprints and spectacular outfits. Sadly, her
life has passed as rapidly as her races.''

CONGRESS REACTS ALONG POLITICAL LINES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRIS BLACK  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democrats questioned the fairness of the process
and Republicans expressed skepticism about President Clinton's
truthfulness in congressional reaction to the release of Clinton's
videotaped grand jury testimony Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Republicans are overreaching,'' said Senator John
F. Kerry. ``I think they are in great danger of abusing the process
in a way that will invite retribution by the American public, and
they need to stop this nonsense and come up with a streamlined
process to bring this to a close,'' said Kerry, who called on the
president Sunday to volunteer immediately to testify before the
House Judiciary Committee to spare the nation a protracted
impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   By 1:30 p.m., Kerry's office had received 1,400 telephone calls
from constituents, and 80 percent ``want the president to be left
alone,'' said Jim Jones, Kerry's spokesman. Early last week the
calls to Kerry's office ran against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Representative Charles Canady, a Florida Republican and a member
of the House Judiciary Committee that is considering an impeachment
inquiry, said lying under oath would constitute grounds for
impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the president understands the meaning of an oath,''
Canady said. ``I think he understands the obligation to tell the
truth. I do believe that if the president lied under oath before
the grand jury that is an impeachable offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The House was not in session Monday because of Rosh Hashanah,
the Jewish New Year, and few were present in the Senate, which
convened for debate but scheduled no roll call votes.
</P>
<P>
   The deeply divided Judiciary Committee voted Friday in favor of
Monday's release of the Clinton videotape and more than 3,000 pages
of evidence collected by Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr. The
committee is expected to meet later this week to determine what
they will not release in the remaining 16 boxes of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Representative William Delahunt, the Massachusetts Democrat,
said that he will attempt to delay the release of the rest of
Starr's evidence evidence beyond next Monday's deadline so
Judiciary Committee members can review it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people want us to take a look at it. They don't
want the staff to examine it for us,'' Delahunt said. ``Let's get
it done, but let's not sacrifice fairness and thoughtful
deliberation. ... This is simply too important. It is a matter of
gravity.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative James Rogan, a California Republican, described
himself as ``disturbed'' by Clinton's videotaped testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is still a long way to go,'' said Rogan. ``We have to
give him the benefit of the doubt.''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Martin Meehan, a Massachusetts Democrat, said
Congress needs to find a way ``to admonish the president's behavior
and at the same time put this behind us....If we can find a way to
spare the country that process (of impeachment), that would be in
the best interests of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Senator Edward M. Kennedy said he is concerned the president
``is being treated unfairly by the Republican majority in Congress.
The videotape and other materials are a one-sided account of what's
happened _ it's the prosecutor's version,'' Kennedy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they chose the wrong day to do it,'' said Senate
Democratic Leader Tom Daschle during a news conference called to
announce a Democratic proposal to help farmers. ``They didn't have
to release this today. The president is making a major foreign
policy address, and it's a major Jewish holiday. ''
</P>
<P>
   Representative Patrick Kennedy, the Rhode Island Democrat,
attended Clinton's address on the threat of international terrorism
at the United Nations Monday. He described the warm reception that
greeted Clinton as a ``spontaneous expression of good will and
solidarity.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The overall impression today was one of pure joy when the
whole congress of the United Nations stood and gave the president a
standing ovation when he came into the hall,'' Patrick Kennedy
said. ``Despite all the pundits and the critics, the common sense
of everybody tells us that what is going on, albeit serious, is a
charade when compared to the world's real problems.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a day of high-minded indifference to the
disclosure of his grand-jury testimony, President Clinton passed
his time Monday in the consoling company of admiring fellow world
leaders, contemplating terrorism, Social Security, the degradation
of the oceans, and the social safety net in the Netherlands.
</P>
<P>
   He did not mention his grim-faced testimony, and he did not
watch any of it either, his aides said.
</P>
<P>
   After a speech to the United Nations and lunch with assorted
heads of state, Clinton went to the New York University School of
Law to discuss how to strengthen democracy as global markets blur
national boundaries. In a room full of aspiring lawyers and
accomplished professors, he was not asked about his grand-jury
experience.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, the president chewed over connections among domestic
politics, social issues, economic development, environmental change
and other matters with his friend Tony Blair, the prime minister of
Great Britain; Romano Prodi, the prime minister of Italy; and Petar
Stoyanov, the president of Bulgaria.
</P>
<P>
   It was the kind of kitchen-table, peripatetic, highbrow gab that
Clinton pioneered in Arkansas and has tried to translate to the
world stage as president.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, he and Blair have conducted these sorts of
earnest conversations before, but privately, with advisers in
Washington and just outside London. This was the first time they
treated the public _ for two hours _ to their earnest search to
identify the world's looming problems and to define what they call
a ``third way'' in politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe in activist government, but highly disciplined,''
the president said, in trying to explain the concept to the
audience in front of him and to that slice of the television
audience that was not preoccupied with replays of his grand-jury
testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Blair said, ``We are witnessing, in effect, the rebirth of
progressive politics,'' which he described as an eagerness for
progress combined with a commitment to justice. Blair credited
Clinton, whom he called Bill, with giving the world ``hope and
confidence'' that powerful nations would intervene to prevent
humanitarian disasters.
</P>
<P>
   The four leaders sat in red leather armchairs, with a round
wooden table in front of them and an antique,
here-there-be-monsters globe at their left. Clinton led the
discussion, sinking back casually in his seat and pointing a finger
as he posed questions to his fellow leaders. Hillary Rodham
Clinton, who sat in the front row, did not participate, as she had
in the private sessions.
</P>
<P>
   The president quickly warmed to the discussion, describing the
social safety net in the Netherlands, the needs of the Social
Security system in the United States, and one Ugandan village's
attempts to use ``microcredit,'' or tiny loans, to build the
``infrastructure of civil society.'' At one point, Clinton recalled
former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo's maxim that people may campaign
in poetry but must govern in prose, as he turned to Prodi.
</P>
<P>
   ``Romano, what's your biggest domestic challenge?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Prodi replied in his gravelly baritone, ``My prose, my prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Grinning, the president returned, ``Italians never have to speak
in prose.''
</P>
<P>
   Things got so casual by late in the session that Clinton was
waving his hands as he offered breezy examples of his efforts to
address the degradation of the oceans or to increase financing for
research and development into the environment. Sucking on a candy,
he said that in response Republicans in Congress ``say that it's a
communist plot, and they hold hearings on it.''
</P>
<P>
   As the audience laughed, Clinton said that he was trying to make
a serious point, that too many policy-makers ``see an iron law
between how much junk you put in the atmosphere and how much your
economy grows.'' Until politicians are convinced that the economy
can grow with environmental protection, he said, ``we are playing
Russian roulette with our children's future.''
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be a quick, one-day trip to New York to
address the United Nations. But the White House has stretched it
into two and a half days of parlays with heads of government. The
response Clinton has gotten _ from a standing ovation at the United
Nations to the affectionate way Prodi called him Bill _ seemed sure
to bolster his mood.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Whenever he has been confronted by scandal, Clinton has tried to
direct attention instead toward his devotion to confronting the
problems facing the country. That technique did not work Monday, at
least in the view of White House aides, who were seething over the
wall-to-wall broadcast coverage of the president's testimony, which
took place on August 17.
</P>
<P>
   Mike McCurry, the White House press secretary, said he was not
surprised that Clinton's speech at the United Nations, a call for a
global crusade against terrorism, received less media attention
than his testimony. The testimony, he said, ``has had that impact
of fewer electrons dispersed in the air on that very vital and
important subject.''
</P>
<P>
   Decrying the release by the Republican-dominated Congress of
Clinton's videotaped grand-jury appearance, he called Monday
``arguably an unnecessary day in the life of our country, an awful
day.''
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Hillary Rodham Clinton presided over a two-hour
panel discussion at NYU on the topic ``Civil Society and the Future
of Democracy.''
</P>
<P>
   In a room packed with professors, visiting policy-makers, law
students (and more reporters than usually sit through academic
discussions), Mrs. Clinton was greeted with especially loud and
long applause. And the other members of her panel took pains to
show their regard for her.
</P>
<P>
   In her own short and sober remarks, Mrs. Clinton emphasized the
need to nurture citizenship, and to find new ways to govern at a
time when the old ways of governing are no longer effective.
</P>
<P>
   Warning that neither government nor globalization should be
blamed as the root of all evil, Mrs. Clinton said, in what sounded
very much like a personal creed, that we have to take the world as
we find it and do what we can to improve upon it.

DOCUMENTS PAINT SYMPATHETIC PORTRAIT OF LEWINSKY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON - ``Can you guys call me Monica?''
</P>
<P>
   Scorned and ridiculed on much of the planet, Monica S. Lewinsky
found friends and refuge in the unlikely confines of a courtroom
filled with grand jurors whose names she may never know.
</P>
<P>
   In a remarkable twist, the members of Grand Jury 97-2
emotionally embraced Lewinsky last month as she laid out her story,
from her secret affair with President Clinton to her devastating
betrayal by Linda R. Tripp. They urged her to open up about the
lurid details of her sexual affair with the president, advised her
on how to deal with her fears, and readily agreed to her plea that
they call her by her first name.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 10 days after the independent counsel, Kenneth W.
Starr, issued a report that portrayed Lewinsky as, by turns, a
hopeless naif and a cunning, vindictive paramour, transcripts of
grand-jury testimony released Monday offer a far softer portrait.
The documents, in sum, don't alter the factual picture much,
revealing evidence that would further incriminate or exculpate
Clinton. But they do provide a richer sense of the context and of
the people involved _ particularly the woman at the center of the
storm.
</P>
<P>
   This Lewinsky often is a jilted, insecure young woman who wins
the sympathy of a roomful of strangers investigating possible
federal crimes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to offer you a bouquet of good wishes that includes
luck, success, happiness and blessings,'' the grand-jury forewoman
told Lewinsky as she concluded her tearful testimony.
</P>
<P>
   The Lewinsky transcripts and records were the largest part of
the 3,183 pages of documents released Monday by the House Judiciary
Committee, which is reviewing 11 possibly impeachable allegations
against Clinton stemming from the affair with Lewinsky and his
testimony about it. The panel blacked out about 120 sections of the
material out of concerns for privacy, national security and decency
standards.
</P>
<P>
   In Lewinsky's case, the grand jury watched for 10 hours over two
days as she recounted her rollercoaster journey from the ranks of
White House interns into a clandestine affair with Clinton and
finally into a trap set by Starr and the FBI on a tip from Tripp,
her former confidante.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the jurors began to question Lewinsky. And they
quickly transformed the final minutes of their interrogation into a
soulful encounter session _ a session with monumental implications
for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry,'' Lewinsky told them, breaking down in tears. ``I'm
sorry for everything that's happened. And I hate Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   One after another, the jurors comforted and counseled Lewinsky,
who had laid out the most private, embarrassing details of her
sexual relationship with Clinton and her often-elaborate effort to
keep it secret. She testified under full immunity from prosecution
for her and her parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've all fallen short,'' a juror told Lewinsky. ``We sin
every day. ... And we get over that. You ask forgiveness and you go
on. So to let you know from here, you have my forgiveness.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 witnesses, including Clinton and Tripp, went before
the grand jury during Starr's 8-month investigation, and none have
told of similar experiences.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, during Clinton's videotaped session, Starr's deputies
gave the impression the only message the jurors wanted to give the
president was to be less evasive in his testimony.
</P>
<P>
   With Lewinsky, who at 25 is less than half Clinton's age, the
jurors sometimes acted more like therapists than investigators.
When a juror asked her why she maintained a secret affair despite
her mother's admonitions, Lewinsky said: ``I fell in love.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at it now, was it love or sexual obsession?'' a
juror asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``More love with a little bit of obsession,'' Lewinsky replied.
``But definitely love.''
</P>
<P>
   She even clung to the belief that Clinton loved her, despite his
angry denial in January that he had not had ``sexual relations with
that woman, Monica Lewinsky.''
</P>
<P>
   Not until Clinton addressed the nation last month after his
grand-jury appearance, Lewinsky said, did she question her love for
Clinton. She testified it was ``very painful'' that Clinton seemed
to characterize their relationship only as sexual. ``It was a lot
more than that to me,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   When a juror questioned how she could consider the relationship
to have been based on anything but sex, Lewinsky said she and the
president shared a mutual affection. ``I thought he had a beautiful
soul,'' she said. ``I just thought he was this incredible person
and when I looked at him I saw a little boy -- and I don't know
what the truth is anymore. ... How could I know the truth of my
love for someone if it was based on him being an actor.''
</P>
<P>
   Again, a juror seemed more inclined to mother Lewinsky than
cross-examine her. ``He was a married, and it wasn't no secret of
that fact,'' the juror said. ``But you want to talk about truth.
... It all seems so -- like a fantasy.''
</P>
<P>
   The jurors saw other faces of Lewinsky, from her insecurity
about her fluctuating weight to her penchant for discussing her
affair with Clinton with friends, despite the considerable risk of
public exposure.
</P>
<P>
   At times, she expressed intense jealousy of Hillary Rodham
Clinton, particularly when she saw footage of the Clintons ``being
romantic'' on their vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Other times, amid the grave atmosphere of the tightly guarded
grand-jury room, Lewinsky displayed youthful charm in detailing
dozens of gifts she gave Clinton, including ``a little box that's
called hugs and kisses.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a cute little tchotchke,'' she testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky described herself as a ``date-oriented person'' who
compiled detailed records of her relationship with Clinton, even
going so far as keeping the dates on a spreadsheet in her computer
at her public affairs office at the Pentagon.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her self-avowed insecurity, she said she saw herself as
``a person who always thinks can fix everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, she said she offered Clinton advice about how to resolve
the former sexual harassment lawsuit filed against him by Paula
Corbin Jones. Mrs. Clinton should appear on television to say how
difficult the case had been on her and Chelsea, Lewinsky testified,
and Clinton should go to the White House briefing room to announce
that he had settled the case for a financial sum over the
objections of his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky also detailed some of her attempts to cover up her
affair with Clinton, including persuading his secretary, Betty
Currie, to use the code name Kay when paging her. Tripp was to use
the code name Mary, and Lewinsky would refer to Clinton as ``her''
to avoid detection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Deep paranoia'' eventually overcame her as she sensed Tripp
turning on her, Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from the grand jurors, Lewinsky testified
about Tripp wearing a secret recording device in January so the FBI
could monitor their conversations. And she told of Starr's
investigators confronting her two days later and telling her she
faced up to 27 years in jail for her activities stemming from her
affair with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The jurors expressed sympathy for Lewinsky's treatment by
Starr's prosecutors and disdain for Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   One grand juror advised Lewinsky that ``even though right now
you feel a lot of hate for Linda Tripp, you need to move on and
leave her where she is because whatever goes around comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   Another juror agreed. ``It comes around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It does,'' another juror said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she is definitely going to have to give an account for
what she did, so you need to just go past her and don't keep her
because that's going to keep you out,'' the juror said.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a final piece of advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``Monica, none of us in this room are perfect,'' a juror told
her. ``We all fall and we fall several times a day. The only
difference between my age and when I was your age is now I get up
faster. If I make a mistake and fall, I get up and brush myself
off. I used to stay there a while after a mistake. That's all I
have to say.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an extraordinary and grueling display, President
Clinton's grand jury testimony was broadcast to the nation Monday
as a centerpiece in his possible impeachment, with Clinton
alternately argumentative and contrite, furious and crestfallen as
he dueled with criminal prosecutors over perjury allegations in the
White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give anything in the world not to have to admit what I've
had to admit today,'' the president declared dolefully in his
four-hour video-taped testimony. Even so, he repeatedly rebuffed
prosecutors' attempts to have him discuss in detail his sexual
misconduct with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern, and
the seven months of denials that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words echoed through office warrens and family rooms
as a team of prosecutors led by Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr aggressively bored in on the chief executive in the
Aug. 17 White House testimony in seeking grounds for Congress to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this four-year, $40-million investigation come
down to parsing of the definition of sex,'' the president
complained in a broadside at Starr, who used his original
Whitewater mandate to branch out into the sex-and-mendacity
allegations of presidential misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation was transfixed by the televised spectacle of
Clinton's being the first president to testify as a criminal
target, the scandal inquiry moved apace on Capitol Hill. The House
Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages of additional
evidence, notably the full grand jury testimony of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever asked me to lie,'' said Ms. Lewinsky, who
delighted Clintonites by testifying that at different points she
had told lies to Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile friend who
furtively taped her tales of a presidential affair. Ms. Lewinsky
said Ms. Tripp also had encouraged her to keep the notoriously
stained dress as evidence of her interplay with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stabbed her in the back,'' the president said in his own
testimony, speaking of Ms. Tripp's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Starr's report has noted that the FBI found some
of the Tripp recordings are duplicate tapes, raising the
possibility that ``she has lied under oath'' in testifying that all
were originals.
</P>
<P>
   With additional material expected within the week, there was no
immediate measure of how the public airing of the presidential
testimony might affect House members who have been predicting a
formal impeachment inquiry. Many of them have already concluded
Clinton lied but are pondering whether that merits impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted to ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms.
Lewinsky, but he adamantly resisted attempts to prove that he had
misused his office, suborned perjury or lied in the earlier Paula
Jones civil lawsuit deposition in which he denied having sexual
intercourse with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse,'' the
president maintained, denying that the instances of oral sex
described to the grand jury by Ms. Lewinsky amounted to evidence of
perjury. He contended there was a ``common understanding'' among
Americans that sexual relations must include intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet the grand jurors, if they were talking about people
they know, and said they have a sexual relationship, they meant
they were sleeping together; they meant they were having
intercourse together,'' Clinton declared looking directly at the
camera in facing the grand jury and, now, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As it developed, grand jurors sent back word from the panel room
down Pennsylvania Avenue that they were not satisfied and wanted
him to answer more directly and specifically. But the president
politely refused to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to discuss something that is intensely painful
to me,'' he declared in refusing to venture beyond his careful
admission of ``inappropriate intimate contact.'' The issue is
crucial, for an admission to outright perjury in the Jones suit
would feed the mood of House Republicans to open an impeachment
inquiry and eventually present charges for Clinton's trial in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president's testimony filled a 3,183-page book that was
instantly on sale across the nation, replete with photographic
evidence of the Lewinsky assignation dress. Even more, the
testimony produced countless moments of embarrassment for Clinton,
who at one point denied any knowledge of Ms. Lewinsky's assertion
that he had once talked to her of leaving the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hard-eyed adversarial stakes, Clinton managed at
times to smile and be genial in answering, as when he declared he
was unsurprised that Ms. Lewinsky told people about her dealings
with him. ``She couldn't help it; it's part of her psyche,'' said
the president who last January denied he had sex with ``that
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In an avuncular tone, he maintained he only tried to help her
find a job out of friendship, not anti-prosecutorial intrigue at
the White House. ``She's a good young woman with a good young
heart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the city was awash in partisan post-mortems, with
Democrats noting the prosecutors did not pursue such once headlined
issues as the ``talking points'' memo. Republicans insisted that,
even allowing for Clinton's qualified definition of sex, Ms.
Lewinsky testified clearly that he had touched her intimately, even
by the Jones suit definition. Michael McCurry, the president's
spokesman, said the testimony mainly showed how prosecutors sought
to ``browbeat and badger'' Clinton and that its release by House
Republicans was steeped in ``rank partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   The president attempted a course in which was he alternately
apologetic for his personal behavior and firmly defensive of his
national stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what people do when they do the wrong thing,'' Clinton
summarized of his sexual misbehavior and his attempts to keep it
private. ``I tried to do it when nobody else was looking.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors, delving into ever deepening levels of embarassing
detail _ even mentioning the use of ``sexual aid'' _ took turns in
trying to budge the president from his defense of his actions.
While he appeared to seethe at that detailed description from Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony, he held to his previous denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will revert to my former statement,'' Clinton said, offering
a steely glare, but not following the prosecutor down that path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to answer your trick questions,'' Clinton added
sharply when a prosecutor, his tone dripping with doubt, asked
whether the president was fulfilling his oath to ``tell the whole
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he fenced with questioners over the precise meaning of
such words as ``is'' and ``alone,'' Clinton's demeanor seemed to
strengthen and he complained that, from the first, his problem was
rooted in political enemies aiming ``a wrecking ball'' at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with, in some ways, the most mysterious area of
human life,'' he said of sex, attempting to draw Rashomon-like
parallels with his problem and the clash of allegations seven years
ago between Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas as Thomas was appointed
to the Supreme Court. ``I'm doing the best I can to give you honest
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Hill-Thomas clash, Clinton said, ``I think they both
thought they were telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr prosecutors pressed him with the physical evidence of
his own predicament.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. President, if there is a semen stain belonging to you on
a dress of Ms. Lewinsky's, how would you explain that?'' asked
prosecutor Robert Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, the president, noting he had volunteered a DNA blood
test, declined to discuss any details. ``That's a question you
already know the answer to,'' he said. ``Not if, but you know
whether.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Clinton's problem in facing Starr was his
six-hour deposition on Jan. 17 before lawyers for Ms. Jones who,
unbeknownst to the president, had heard detailed allegations about
Ms. Lewinsky from Ms. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal in this deposition was to be truthful, but not
particularly helpful,'' Clinton told the grand jury when asked
about the initial denials of a Lewinsky relationship. ``I deplored
it,'' he said of the Jones suit. ``But I was determined to walk
through the mine field of this deposition without violating the
law. And I believe I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His questionners pressed him most particularly on his declining
to answer detailed questions about his argument that oral sex was
not part of sexual relations. A grand juror's question was relayed
to him: ``What legal basis are you declining to answer these
questions?''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who throughout the scandal has declined any
suggestion that he would resort to his Fifth Amendment right not to
answer incriminating questions, replied that he did not consider
himself required ``to say and do things that I don't think are
necessary, and that I think, frankly, go too far in trying to
criminalize my private life.''
</P>
<P>
   To another juror's question about oral sex, the president
underlined the distinction in the Jones suit listing several
erogenous zones in the definition of sex. ``Because that is,'' said
the president, ``if the deponent is the person who has oral sex
performed on him, then the contact is with _ not with anything on
that list, but with the lips of another person. It seems to be
self-evident that that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to build a case that the president abused his office,
prosecutors asked about his denying misbehavior to his key aides so
that they defended him daily in public until his qualified
recanting to the nation after his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony. He
replied that he tried to tell them a story ``that would be true,
even if misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I have not had sex with her, as I define it,'' he said.
``So I said things that were true. They may have been misleading,
and if they were, I will have to take responsibility for it, and
I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his meetings with Betty Currie, his White House secretary,
Clinton said he was only to trying to freshen his memory about Ms.
Lewinsky's visits, not illicitly coach Mrs. Currie in advance of
Starr's investigators. ``I wasn't trying to get her to say
something that wasn't so,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not hesitate to use his considerable skills as a
polished public speaker and lawyer, and even presented the argument
that history itself impelled him to be sparing in discussing the
lurid sexual details of his misbehavior that have consumed much of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this to the grand jury: Put yourself in my
position,'' he said, noting how unusual the proceeding was and how
he had already suffered ``a breathtaking number of leaks'' from
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am right to answer all the questions about
perjury,'' he continued in his testimony, which was sealed as he
spoke. ``But not to say things which will be forever in the annals
of the United States because of this unprecedented videotape and
may be leaked at any time. I think it's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points, the Starr prosecutors appeared thoroughly
frustrated by the president's performance, particularly when they
sought to pin down his attorney's flat-out denial last January of
any sex with Ms. Lewinsky. ``It depends on what the meaning of the
word `is' means,'' he replied. ``If `is'' means `is and never has
been,' that's one thing. If it means, `there is none,' that was a
completely true statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no apologies for his language. As he
concluded, he made sure to include a summary worthy of a career
campaign speaker, in which he said he had to ``contend with things
no previous president has ever had to contend with,'' including the
Jones lawsuit, now dismissed, and the lengthy, costly Starr inquiry
that has dogged his days of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And during this whole time, I have tried as best I could to
keep my mind on the job the American people gave me,'' he declared,
looking squarely into the grand jury camera.

U.S., MEXICO TO SWAP PRISONERS UNDER EXCHANGE PROGRAM

<P>
   An East Texas gun dealer who has spent six months in a Mexican
border jail will be among 14 Americans returned to the United
States as early as Tuesday under a routine prisoner exchange,
officials confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Tommy Bean, a 59-year-old retired car dealer and gun show
exhibitor from Vidor, was sentenced by a Mexican judge to a
five-year prison term for illegally importing 203 rounds of
ammunition last March. Bean said his crime was unintentional.
</P>
<P>
   Mexican police in Nuevo Laredo found the ammunition in the back
of Bean's Suburban as he and four companions crossed the border to
eat dinner following a Laredo gun show. His friends were held
briefly and released, but Bean, as the owner of the vehicle, was
charged and eventually convicted. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Bean's case and those of scores of other Americans jailed for
taking guns and ammunition across the border have spotlighted the
comparatively harsh laws concerning the possession and importation
of weapons in Mexico. Private gun ownership is generally outlawed
in Mexico. Even taking a small amount of ammunition or a pocket
knife across the border can result in an arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Possession of a weapon can be punished by up to five years in
prison, while those caught with firearms or ammunition reserved by
Mexican law for military use face five- to 30-year sentences and
hefty fines. The punishment is the same for Mexicans caught with
such weapons.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, more than 120 Americans have been arrested in
Mexico on weapons charges and 69 are jailed, U.S. officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Rufus Watkins, the American consul in Nuevo Laredo, said Bean
was moved last Friday with three other Americans from the ``La
Loma'' prison in the Mexican border town to a prison outside of
Monterrey to be processed for the expected transfer to the United
States. They could arrive at the El Paso International Airport as
early as Tuesday, Watkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Six other Americans remain jailed on weapons charges in Nuevo
Laredo, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Mexican) prison director called me ... He hoped that
sometime this week they'd be in the United States,'' Watkins said.
``It's in the hands of the U.S. Department of Justice and the
Mexican authorities.''
</P>
<P>
   The prisoner exchange, which will send home at least 89 Mexican
citizens who are being held in U.S. custody, is part of a routine
exchange under a 1977 treaty with Mexico. About 1,500 Americans and
2,118 Mexicans have been exchanged under the treaty. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Contacted at her home in Vidor, Bean's wife, Sadie Bean,
declined to comment on his expected release.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Watkins confirmed that another American being exchanged along
with Bean was convicted on weapons charges, but he said he could
not release his name. However, press reports have quoted Mexican
prison officials as saying the man is Jose Lerma, a carpet
installer from Waco, who was convicted for possession of nine
bullets.
</P>
<P>
   As in past prisoner exchanges, American citizens are flown by
Mexican authorities to El Paso and then taken to La Tuna, a
minimum-security U.S. federal prison outside El Paso. They are held
there until their Mexican sentences are reviewed and they are given
an equivalent U.S. federal sentence.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
(BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, U.S. Parole Commission attorney Richard Preston
said the American prisoners must be interviewed by federal
probation officers, who translate their Mexican court sentences and
other legal documents and conduct an extensive review of the
prisoner's criminal history, employment and family background.
After a 25- to 30-page post-sentence report is completed _ a
process that can be delayed for months by the probation
department's workload _ it is forwarded to the parole commission in
Washington for review.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a hypothetical, I would say at least a month, no more than
four months before his case is reviewed,'' Preston said, referring
to a hypothetical example of a case similar to Bean's. ``If it
turns out he had bazookas or nuclear (bomb) triggers _ I don't know
what he had _ we might not let him out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, all I can say is, we don't have his file,''
Preston said of Bean.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(END OPTIONAL TRIM) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Jose Barron, the associate warden of La Tuna, said prison
officials are expecting the prisoners' arrival by Saturday at the
latest. Until the Americans arrive, prison officials are not
certain of their crimes, although in past exchanges the majority of
Americans were serving drug sentences in Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   ``The files come with them,'' Barron said. ``We have an idea,
but I wouldn't want to speculate. We're not 100 percent sure until
they step off the plane and we ID them and get their files.''

<P>
   Florence Griffith Joyner, the three-time gold medalist at the
1988 Summer Olympics who revolutionized women's sprinting with her
searing speed and flamboyant fashion sense, died at her home in
Mission Viejo, Calif. She was 38.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Foster, a former champion hurdler and a family friend, said
he had spoken with Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, and with
her sister-in-law, the track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and had
been told that Griffith Joyner was believed to have suffered a
heart seizure.
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was performed Monday afternoon, but the results were
not immediately reported.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Hector Rivera, a spokesman for the Orange County sheriff's
department, said that a 911 call was received Monday at 6:30 a.m.,
Pacific time, from Griffith Joyner's husband indicating that she
was unresponsive and not breathing. No evidence of foul play was
discovered or was expected, Rivera said.
</P>
<P>
   Foster, who is an executive in the marketing firm that
Joyner-Kersee owns in St. Louis, and who has extensive contact with
the family, said he had been told that ``she never woke up this
morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner had suffered a seizure two years ago during a
flight and was hospitalized briefly. The family said little about
that incident. Bob Kersee, who was Griffith Joyner's coach and who
is married to Jackie Joyner-Kersee, said Monday that there had been
no diagnosis of the 1996 incident. As far as he knew, Foster said,
``She was doing fine.''
</P>
<P>
   A decade after her shattering achievements in track and field,
Griffith Joyner's sprint records still stand, and many feel they
will carry into the next century.
</P>
<P>
   Known by the abbreviation ``FloJo'' _ even her name was fast _
she set the world record for 100 meters at 10.49 seconds at the
1988 Olympic trials in Indianapolis, then established the mark of
21.34 seconds in winning the 200 meters at the 1988 Summer Games in
Seoul, South Korea, where Griffith Joyner also won gold in the 100
meters and the 4x100-meter relay. She also took a silver medal in
the 4x400-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Not only did Griffith Joyner run considerably faster than any
woman before her or since, she displayed a spectacular flashiness
in the way she ran, dressing in one-legged spandex body suits and
wearing six-inch long, elaborately decorated fingernails. After
retiring in 1989, she designed the uniforms of the Indiana Pacers
of the National Basketball Association. And she also served as
co-chair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent and
captivated by her style,'' President Clinton said Monday, praising
Griffith Joyner's work with disadvantaged children.
</P>
<P>
   Only now are Griffith Joyner's records even being approached.
Marion Jones of the United States ran the 100 in 10.65 seconds
earlier this month, and the 200 in 21.62. But even with her present
dominance, Jones is still tenths of a second away from Griffith
Joyner's records, which might as well be miles, considering that
personal bests are usually lowered by hundredths of a second at a
time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think she established herself in sport like Babe Ruth,''
said Terry Crawford, who coached the American women's track and
field team at the 1988 Summer Games.
</P>
<P>
   To some, however, Griffith Joyner has come more to symbolize
Roger Maris than Babe Ruth, and her accomplishments carry both
literal and figurative asterisks. Some have questioned the validity
of her 100-meter record because of a possibly faulty wind gauge and
others have questioned whether the stunning times she ran were
facilitated by performance-enhancing drugs, something she always
denied. She never failed a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   She set the world record in the 100 meters on July 16, 1988, on
a day of swirling wind in Indianapolis. The mark of 10.49 seconds
was astonishing; it broke Evelyn Ashford's previous record by
27-hundredths of a second. In the era of electronic timing, the
women's 100-meter record had never been lowered by more than
13-hundredths of a second.
</P>
<P>
   That the wind gauge on the track read 0.0, meaning there was no
tailwind or headwind, struck many as illogical, considering that
the wind gauge on the nearby triple jump runway showed a reading
well above the allowable aiding wind of 4.47 miles an hour. The
statistics manual used by track and field's world governing body
now includes an asterisk by Griffith Joyner's time and the remarks,
``probably strongly wind assisted.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Some in Europe have called for a review of the record, but Craig
Masback, the chief executive officer of USA Track and Field, the
sport's national governing body, said the matter was closed. He
called Griffith Joyner a ``ground breaker'' who set standards of
speed and flair ``that track and field is still trying to catch up
to.''
</P>
<P>
   Crawford, the 1988 Olympic track coach, said: ``There was no
wind; I was right there. The track was brand new. It was hot and
humid, ideal conditions.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the significant lowering of her sprint times and her
increased musculature in 1988, Griffith Joyner was subjected to
rumors and accusations about the possible use of such
performance-enhancing drugs as anabolic steroids and human growth
hormone.
</P>
<P>
   The most serious allegation was made in 1989 by Darrell
Robinson, a former national 400-meter champion, who said that he
had sold human growth hormone to Griffith Joyner in 1988. She
vehemently denied the charge, calling Robinson a ``compulsive,
crazy, lying lunatic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have never taken any drugs,'' Griffith Joyner said at the
time. ``I don't believe in them. It's a false accusation.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, it was one that continued to have Griffith Joyner's
achievements judged with some ambivalence by her rivals, including
Ashford, the former world record holder at 100 meters who finished
second to Griffith Joyner in the 1988 Summer Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   While praising Griffith Joyner's speed and flair, Ashford said
Monday, ``I think for Florence, the drug issue will always come up,
whether she did it or not.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner attributed her improved times to weight
training, distance running and increased determination after her
1987 marriage to Al Joyner, who had won the triple jump at the 1984
Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She was not a one-year wonder,
having won a silver medal at 200 meters at the 1984 Summer Games.
``I never had any doubt as to the credibility of her records,''
said Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   Delores Florence Griffith was born Dec. 21, 1959, in the Watts
section of Los Angeles, the seventh of 11 children. Her father was
an electrical technician and her mother was a teacher. Always a
fashion maverick, she was once asked to leave a shopping mall for
wearing her pet boa constrictor around her neck like a feather boa.
</P>
<P>
   According to David Wallechinsky's ``Complete Book of The Summer
Olympics,'' Griffith Joyner began racing as a 7-year-old, but
stopped temporarily in 1979, when she withdrew from California
State-Northridge to help support her family. Working as a bank
teller, she was later persuaded by Coach Bob Kersee to attend UCLA,
from which she received a degree in psychology in 1983 and emerging
acclaim as a sprinter.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner went into semi-retirement after winning a silver
medal at the 1984 Summer Games, working in a bank and as a
beautician, but she lost weight and returned to serious training in
1987, preparing for her stunning performances a year later.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her husband, her survivors include their
5-year-old daughter, Mary.

MARKET PLACE: CONSOLIDATION AMONG MEDICAL-DEVICE MAKERS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By DAVID J. MORROW   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A note to shareholders of all medical-device manufacturers: This
is only the beginning.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling to ratchet up market share, the United States'
medical-device makers are out to snap up their weaker brethren at a
startling pace.
</P>
<P>
   In two long-anticipated deals, Guidant Corp., one of the world's
leading makers of cardiac defibrillators, announced Monday that it
would buy the pacemaker division of Switzerland's Sulzer Medica
Ltd. for as much as $850 million.
</P>
<P>
   No sooner had investors received word of that deal than General
Electric's medical-systems unit said it would buy Marquette Medical
Systems Inc., a maker of heart-monitoring machines, for about $808
million in stock. What was especially odd about this deal was that
GE had divested itself of the same business in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Has the world gone mad?
</P>
<P>
   Hardly. With several of the nation's small medical-device makers
struggling, the industry's larger players are making what analysts
call prime acquisitions _ deals to get sophisticated products at
affordable prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Guidant was really getting overwhelmed in the pacemaker
market,'' said Kurt Kruger, a medical-device industry analyst with
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities. ``But with the acquisition, they
picked up several market share points. And they got it at a very
good price, less than three times sales. You could almost say it
was a discount.''
</P>
<P>
   Both acquisitions were boon deals. Aside from merging to gain
girth for price battles with health-maintenance organizations,
medical-device companies need size for research dollars and
technology. Larger companies also steal accounts from smaller ones,
since most of the nation's large hospitals like to buy their wares
from only a few suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only will Guidant, which is based in Indianapolis, and GE,
already the world's largest maker of magnetic resonance equipment,
pick up more financial heft, they will also enormously expand their
product lines. Medtronic Inc., based in Indianapolis, controls
about 46 percent of the cardiac-defibrillator market, according to
Kruger. Guidant, with a 21 percent market stake, will raise that to
30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   GE's medical-systems division, meanwhile, gets a product that it
doesn't have: heart-monitoring machines. Analysts said GE wanted
Marquette Medical Systems to expand its offerings to hospitals.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was no product overlap with the acquisition by GE,''
said Suey Wong, the vice president of research at Robert W. Baird &AMP;
Co. ``These acquisitions make sense in that it is easier to acquire
a company to get technology than to develop it on your own.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though analysts applauded both deals, Wall Street had a
mixed reaction. The shares of Marquette Medical Systems soared 55.3
percent to close at $42.50 each, a 52-week high. General Electric
closed at $79.25, up $1.375.
</P>
<P>
   Guidant shares, however, fell $1.1875, to $74, while Sulzer
Medica's American depository receipts, worth one-tenth a share,
dropped $1, to $17.875. Analysts said the two stocks tumbled
because investors had long anticipated the deal's announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts are confident that these acquisitions will not be the
industry's last. With low price-earnings ratios and a bounty of
sophisticated products, several small medical-device companies
appear to be prime takeover targets. What is especially noteworthy
is that several make cardiac equipment, a field that is
consolidating faster than many others.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One of the most innovative of the cardiac-equipment suppliers is
Arterial Vascular Engineering in Santa Rosa, Calif. The company,
which makes stents and balloons for angioplasty, is in one of the
fastest-growing segments of the health-care industry. Better yet,
the company's stock has a price-earnings ratio of 23.7, slightly
below the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 at 24.
</P>
<P>
   ``AVE is what we call one of the single-product companies,''
Kruger said. ``They have $500 million each year in stent sales and
have a substantial sales force. It would be an attractive buy.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to name any potential acquisition target, it's common
for analysts to single out companies that have recently completed
an initial public offering. One popular pick this fall is
Cardiothoracic Systems, based in Cupertino, Calif. The company, a
maker of disposable instruments for minimally invasive
cardiothoracic surgery, has a market capitalization of just $64
million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet analysts say that some of the likely candidates for
acquisition may appear surprising. Analysts are pondering the
future of St. Jude Medical, one of Guidant's competitors and a
leading maker of pacemakers and defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   What makes St. Jude Medical a likely player? Not only is the
company a leader in pacemakers, Kruger said, but it is also
struggling. But with a price-earnings ratio of 22.4, two points
below the S&AMP;P, the deal may be too good to pass up.

TOKYO LEADER BLAMES MANY FOR BANKS' CRISIS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID E. SANGER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Japan's prime minister, Keizo Obuchi, Monday blamed
his predecessor, Japan's powerful finance ministry and the heads of
the country's huge financial institutions for wasting years before
facing up to the crippling banking crisis as well as a deep
recession that is worsening the world's economic turmoil.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's comments, in an interview Monday as he prepared to
address the United Nations, amounted to an unusual acknowledgment
by a Japanese leader that the government and private sector had
made huge errors that have ricocheted through economies around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, he failed to lay out any new initiatives, and
appeared to acknowledge that an agreement on the banking crisis
reached late last week with opposition leaders failed to work out
critical details about how the government will deal with bank debts
of nearly a trillion dollars.
</P>
<P>
   That accord was fraying in Tokyo even as Obuchi prepared for
what promises to be a tense first meeting with President Clinton
Tuesday at the Rockefeller family estate in Tarrytown, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   As politicians in Tokyo bickered over whether the accord limits
the ability of the Japanese government to pump billions of dollars
in public funds into failing banks, the Tokyo Stock Exchange fell
drastically, hitting its lowest point since mid-1986.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi arrives here a besieged man. Both Britain and Germany
have joined the United States in urging Japan to act immediately,
and Japanese officials fret these days that they are being blamed _
unfairly, in their eyes _ for the economic meltdown of Southeast
Asia and Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Monday the International Monetary Fund, which is normally
extremely cautious about criticizing a nation that is also one of
its largest sources of funds, declared in its annual report that
one of the leading risks to the world economy now is that Japan
``will not move promptly and resolutely to address its financial
sector problems while insuring adequate domestic demand.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Speed is becoming increasingly critical,'' the Fund's report
concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi was clearly prepared Monday for the inevitable criticism:
His briefing papers included a small tab to bring him directly to
his talking points on the mounting criticism. The handwritten tab
was marked ``Too little, too late.''
</P>
<P>
   He volunteered, however, that ``unfortunately, the Japanese
people in general still lack the awareness'' of how the country's
economic troubles are affecting the rest of the world. He said the
lack of awareness has contributed to problems with Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi's portrayal of the Japanese political system as insular
is hardly surprising _ critics of the country have been offering
similar analyses since Commodore Perry forced the country to open
to foreign trade 130 years ago _ but it is a sharp contrast to the
way Japanese politicians spoke during the height of the country's
prosperity in the late 1980s. Then, they justified Japan's
worldwide buying spree as natural for a country that had used the
power of the yen to internationalize.
</P>
<P>
   Monday Obuchi gave a very different interpretation of those
events.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no wonder the Japanese financial institutions are
criticized,'' the longtime Japanese politician said. Pointing to
the view of the New York skyline outside the floor-to-ceiling
windows of his hotel suite opposite the United Nations, he said:
``Someone even bought Rockefeller Center. What did they produce?
Losses. And now they impose them on the Japanese people.''
</P>
<P>
   At another point Obuchi even took a mild jab at Japan's finance
ministry, which would see some powers stripped away under last
week's agreement.
</P>
<P>
   He also indirectly criticized the performance of his
predecessor, Ryutaro Hashimoto, describing how his policies of
austerity and higher taxes were overwhelmed by the economic crisis
that began in Thailand 14 months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan was not able to make a rapid turnaround in its policy,''
he said. But he insisted that now Japan has made a major shift in
policy. ``Instead of `too little too late' we want to deal with
this in ways that people say `too big, too fast,' `' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   So far, he is at little risk of facing that criticism. While the
Parliament passed legislation during Hashimoto's term that
authorized spending of more than $100 billion to inject capital
into failing banks, the accord reached last week scraps that
system. It is unclear what will replace it, though Obuchi insisted
Monday that ``public money will be used to buy up the shares'' of
failing banks.
</P>
<P>
   Whether and how that happens, however, is likely to be the
subject of considerable debate at the meeting with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin was quite specific in
congressional testimony last week, arguing that Japan's problems _
and Asia's _ cannot be solved without the use of taxpayer dollars
to pump capital into otherwise insolvent banks. The United States
has also called for the management of those banks to be dismissed,
for the shareholders to be wiped out, and for their assets _
property held as collateral for loans _ to be auctioned off
quickly, to revive a frozen property market.
</P>
<P>
   Obuchi skirted most of those subjects, however, saying ``those
matters are not yet worked out.'' But he did argue that Japan could
not risk the uncertainty of letting major banks fail. He noted, for
example, that the total liabilities of the virtually insolvent
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, known as LTCB, are ``worth 1.2 or
1.3 times the total economy of Indonesia.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we cannot tell LTCB to quit operating simply
because the management of that bank was incompetent,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanics of bailing out banks is not the usual stuff of
meetings between prime ministers and presidents, but the session
Monday is bound to focus on those subjects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be highly specific,'' one of Clinton's top economic
aides said last week. ``No one has the luxury for the kind of
happy-talk generalities we've had in most of these meetings.''
</P>
<P>
   But Obuchi and Clinton, in a break from past practice, are
making no joint public appearance to help calm the markets. Some
White House officials say that the Japanese are not eager for their
leader to stand before the press silently while Clinton receives
questions about the Monica Lewinsky matter. The Japanese say that
the White House did not appear eager for a joint appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have their problems,'' one Japanese official said, ``and
we have ours.''

INTERNET HANDLED CLINTON VIDEO PRETTY WELL, OVERALL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WARREN WILSON  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Record crowds mobbed the Internet Tuesday to see video of
President Clinton's grand-jury testimony. And while the network
generally bore up well under the strain, it wasn't problem-free.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNEWS.com, whose Internet presence is managed by Starwave
Corp. in Bellevue, Wash., ``became inaccessible between 10 a.m. and
11 a.m. Pacific time,'' according to Keynote Systems, a Silicon
Valley company that monitors Internet performance.
</P>
<P>
   Both ABC and Starwave are owned by the Walt Disney Co.
</P>
<P>
   ABCNEWS.com remained ``largely inaccessible and unresponsive''
into the afternoon, Keynote said, ``indicating a severe problem
with its Web-server infrastructure or Internet connectivity.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for ABC News said she was unaware of the problem
or the report and couldn't comment.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Keynote said, CNN.COM performed
spectacularly, delivering its home page to Internet users quickly
and with a failure rate of less than 1 percent, even better than
its 40-site performance index.
</P>
<P>
   CNN teams with three outside companies _ including Seattle-based
RealNetworks _ to serve up video over the Internet, spokeswoman
Alison Rudnick said.
</P>
<P>
   It also shifts into ``breaking news mode,'' streamlining its Web
site for maximum performance by removing graphics and other
features that can undermine performance, Rudnick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``CNN's Web site is just such an integral part of their overall
news operation these days,'' Keynote spokesman Gene Shklar said.
</P>
<P>
   The company has enough online experience to have mastered an
important lesson, he added: ``You have to build a Web site to serve
peak demand, not average demand.''
</P>
<P>
   CNN said that about 8 am PDT Monday, almost 20,000 people were
simultaneously watching either the live or the on-demand version of
Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Broadcast.com, which provided audio and video for CNN.com,
MSNBC.com and CourtTV, said it served as many as 50,000 users at
once between the Clinton coverage and its regular programs.
</P>
<P>
   RealNetworks distributed more than a 500,000 copies of its media
player, a record number, over the weekend as people readied their
computers to watch the Clinton video.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is a determining event for video on the Web, said
Mark Bretl, vice president of RealNetworks' media systems division.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rumors of it taking down the Internet have been dispelled,''
Bretl said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet gets a grade of A,'' Keynote's Shklar said. ``I'm
really impressed with how it has responded.''

DU PONT RELATIVE ACCUSED IN DEATH OF HEIR'S GIRLFRIEND  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By IRVIN MOLOTSKY    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WILMINGTON, Del. _ For the second time in two years, a relative
of the du Ponts, Delaware's first family, has been charged in a
killing.
</P>
<P>
   In the new case, Christopher Moseley, the stepfather of a du
Pont heir, Dean MacGuigan, was accused last week of arranging the
killing of Patricia Margello, who the police said was MacGuigan's
girlfriend. The police said Moseley confessed to the crime when he
was arrested in nearby Greenville, Del., as he was about to greet
guests at the site of a golf course that he had proposed building.
</P>
<P>
   Three other people have been charged in connection with Ms.
Margello's death.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, John du Pont killed David Schultz, an Olympic wrestler,
in suburban Philadelphia. He was sentenced last year to 13 to 30
years in prison or a mental hospital, depending on his condition.
</P>
<P>
   In the new case, Henry Schlumpf, a special agent for the FBI,
has filed a complaint in federal district court, saying that
Moseley had waived his right to remain silent and had confessed
that he had arranged to pay to have Ms. Margello killed in Las
Vegas, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Margello's body was found in an air-conditioning duct at the
Del Mar Motel in Las Vegas on Aug. 2. She had been beaten and
strangled, and her body had been bound with wire and tape and
covered with garbage bags before being placed inside the duct,
Schlumpf said.
</P>
<P>
   The police said that Ms. Margello, who was also known as
Patricia Howarth, was the girlfriend of MacGuigan, the son of Lisa
Dean Moseley, a du Pont descendant who lives on an estate in
Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Moseley married Christopher Moseley, who had been the
gardener on her estate, after the death of her second husband. The
estate is known as ``chateau country'' because of the magnificence
of the du Pont estate, and Mrs. Moseley's place was once included
in estate tours.
</P>
<P>
   At the arraignment before Magistrate Judge Mary Pat Thynge, the
FBI did not offer a motive and the U.S. attorney's office here
declined to comment on the case Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Moseley is being held until he returns to court on Tuesday, on a
charge of conspiracy to use interstate facilities in the commission
of a murder-for-hire. The maximum penalty is life in prison or a
death sentence.
</P>
<P>
   According to the FBI complaint, Moseley asked Diana Hironaga in
July to kill Ms. Margello, telephoning her from Greenville when she
was in Las Vegas. The telephone call and other communications
established the interstate aspect of the crime and allowed federal
officers to enter what would otherwise have been a local
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 2, the police and federal agents charged Ms. Hironaga
and two others they said were hired by Moseley, Ricardo Murillo and
Joseph Balignasa, to lure Ms. Margello to the motel. The police
said that Murillo and Balignasa had killed her there.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, according to the FBI complaint, Ms. Hironaga
``notified Moseley by phone that Margello had been murdered as
requested.''
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 4, the complaint says, Ms. Hironaga and Murillo flew to
Philadelphia ``where they were paid a fee for committing the
murder,'' and then the two flew back to Las Vegas. The complaint
did not give the amount of the payment.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks later, Ms. Hironaga confessed to the murder, the FBI
said.
</P>
<P>
   The extent of the du Pont wealth in the area roughly between
Wilmington and Philadelphia can only be estimated.
</P>
<P>
   For example, when John du Pont was sentenced last year for
killing Schultz, his fortune was estimated at $250 million.
</P>
<P>
   Du Pont used his family fortune to build a training camp and
surround himself with outstanding wrestlers who were preparing for
Olympic competition.
</P>
<P>
   A jury in Media, Pa., found du Pont guilty of third-degree
murder but mentally ill. After the verdict was announced, Schultz's
widow, Nancy, said, ``It's comforting to know du Pont was not above
the law.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Late last month, Jose Ubano, an inmate on Rikers
Island, checked into a jail clinic with high fever and abdominal
pains. City officials say Ubano, 29, was hallucinating and seemed
suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   A blood test showed that his liver was weak. But instead of
checking his liver more closely, several officials say, the clinic
sent him to a jail mental health center, where a psychiatrist
placed Ubano on an antipsychotic drug that can create severe
strains on the liver. And 18 hours after taking the drug, Ubano was
rushed to a hospital emergency room, where he died of what one
doctor called ``full-blown liver failure.''
</P>
<P>
   Several city and state agencies are reviewing Ubano's Aug. 31
death, and New York City's Board of Correction, a jail oversight
panel, is examining whether a series of medical errors caused or
hastened it.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said some doctors who had reviewed Ubano's medical
charts questioned whether St. Barnabas' physicians had done enough
tests to assess the extent of his liver damage. They also noted
that he could have been given antipsychotic drugs that would have
filtered through his kidney instead of his liver.
</P>
<P>
   But the questions surrounding his death also have quickly taken
on much larger dimensions: A number of Correction Board officials,
present and former Rikers doctors and public health experts say his
case illustrates how the quality of health care has deteriorated
since a managed care system was installed in the city's jails last
January.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the Board of Correction are also looking into the
deaths of at least three other inmates earlier this year. And while
top city health executives insist that the quality of care remains
high, many critics say that pressures to cut costs, as well as a
large turnover of doctors, have plunged the sprawling jail health
system into its worst crisis in more than two decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have never seen a stream of complaints like this before,''
said John Horan, acting chairman of the Board of Correction, which
sets minimum health standards for the jails.
</P>
<P>
   The complaints started after St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx
won the three-year, $342 million contract to provide health care
for city jails. In seeking bids for the contract, the city said it
would change the way it paid for health care in an effort to save
millions of dollars: Instead of paying each time an inmate was
taken to the hospital, it would provide an annual lump sum for each
inmate's care. Now, though, that approach has become a central
issue in the debate over health care in the jails, with many
critics wondering if the Giuliani administration has given a
private contractor too much financial incentive to cut corners.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic change is that since St. Barnabas took over on
Jan. 1, the number of trips by inmates to some city hospitals,
which have traditionally treated the most serious illnesses, has
dropped by 57 percent, to 1,496 through August, down from 3,456 in
the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at St. Barnabas point to these statistics as a sign
of success, saying they have reduced these trips without
compromising care by expanding the types of care in jail clinics
and treating more inmates on Rikers itself. But the critics say St.
Barnabas has not broadened the services as quickly or as much as it
promised. And they contend that it is waiting too long to send some
inmates to hospitals or medical specialists.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, more than a dozen current and former health care
workers at Rikers said that some inmates, like Ubano, had been
placed in serious jeopardy by failures to take enough diagnostic
tests, delays in sending them to emergency rooms and other mistakes
by harried or inexperienced medical personnel. Several doctors and
medical assistants said some inmates with less critical problems,
like eye and nerve conditions, had also received too little
treatment, adding that shortages of medical supplies had
occasionally interfered with care.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the death of Ubano, the Correction Board is
looking into whether delays in treatment contributed to the deaths
of the three other inmates _ including one whose family has filed a
claim charging that his death from a ruptured aorta could have been
averted if he had been treated sooner for chest pains.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging that Ubano's death has prompted some
disciplinary action, St. Barnabas executives insisted that there
was no problem with their care in the other deaths.

</P>
<P>
   The correction system's foray into managed care is being closely
watched because it has implications that stretch far beyond the
jails. The Giuliani administration has cited the St. Barnabas
contract as a model for containing costs in public health
operations, and it has made similar moves to save huge sums in the
public hospital system that serves many of the city's poor.
</P>
<P>
   To some degree, the complaints at Rikers echo many of the
concerns that have accompanied the expansion of managed care among
private health insurers. The new contract basically calls for St.
Barnabas to receive a lump sum to run more than 15 clinics treating
the 130,000 inmates who pass through Rikers Island and the
Manhattan Detention Complex each year.
</P>
<P>
   St. Barnabas must cover any hospital costs and visits to outside
specialists from that pot of money. So the less it spends, the more
it can earn, and St. Barnabas officials have said they could make
more than $10 million in profits this year.
</P>
<P>
   But while the Giuliani administration sees this approach as a
way to place a lid on costs, some oversight officials believe that
St. Barnabas has clamped down too much. After the Board of
Correction discussed the problems at a meeting last week, board
member David Lenefsky said, ``There has been a prima-facie case
made that St. Barnabas could be below the minimum standards.''
</P>
<P>
   He said those rules require that inmates _ most of whom are
being held awaiting trial _ be offered access to the same kind of
care that they could obtain if they were not incarcerated.
</P>
<P>
   Top officials at the Health and Hospitals Corporation, which
awarded the jail contract, and St. Barnabas executives disputed
that the problems were widespread.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will shape up,'' Joseph Erazo, executive director for
correctional health services at the Health and Hospitals
Corporation, said at the Correction Board meeting. ``You've just
got to give me a little more time.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Barnabas' president, Dr. Ronald Gade, dismissed the level of
complaints as ``markedly low,'' given the complexity of health
issues in the jails, where many inmates have AIDS, tuberculosis and
drug addictions. Referring to some of the deaths and other cases
that have been questioned, he said, ``It seems like people are
looking to see some sort of problems with the patients when I tell
you there was nothing wrong with the care.''
</P>
<P>
   St. Barnabas officials noted that the overall number of
nonviolent deaths in city jails had dropped from 42 in 1997 to 17
so far this year, and Gade said his staff deserved some of the
credit for that. Other medical authorities attribute the drop in
deaths to new drug treatments that help AIDS patients live longer.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Harry Shuman, who runs the jail program for St. Barnabas,
acknowledged that there had been some problems. Shuman said that
since May, he had dismissed five doctors, including some who
endangered patients with poor care. But he would not give details
of those cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, experts say that public hospital and jail systems across
the country are facing similar difficulties in balancing cost and
quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question is how do you guarantee the safety that is
essential for vulnerable populations,'' said Dennis Andrulis, a
department director at the New York Academy of Medicine. ``Cost
containment, if not carefully monitored, can fall out of balance.
You must find that balance.''

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Three days after the president spoke to the country
about his affair with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House
intern told grand jurors that she had been in love with him up
until the minute he went on television and told the world that
their involvement was purely sexual. And where was his apology to
her?
</P>
<P>
   With prosecutors pressing her for more and more graphic detail,
she supplied it. And yet, she also said that although she was upset
and confused, she had no appetite for hurting the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he had a beautiful soul,'' she told the grand jurors
on August 20 in testimony released by Congress Monday. ``I just
thought he was just this incredible person, and when I looked at
him I saw a little boy. And I don't know what the truth is
anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   The country may not like Monica Lewinsky; a recent poll showed
that only 5 percent of Americans held a favorable view of her. But
grand jurors obviously did, urging her to forgive herself, forget
Linda Tripp and get on with her life in a court appearance that
often seemed more like a counseling session.
</P>
<P>
   When first asked about sex with the president, Ms. Lewinsky _
who asked the grand jury to call her Monica _ was so embarrassed
that she had to close her eyes and force herself to answer the
question. And with prosecutors pressing her to specify what body
parts went where, grand jurors seemed to become more and more
sympathetic.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of her testimony on Aug. 20, a juror asked her if
there was anything she wanted to add, and Ms. Lewinsky defended the
president while offering a blanket apology for her own behavior:
``I would just like to say that no one ever asked me to lie and I
was never promised a job for my silence. And that I'm sorry. I'm
really sorry for everything that's happened. And I hate Linda
Tripp,'' she said, and began to cry.
</P>
<P>
   Several grand jurors tried to comfort her. One told her, ``We've
all fallen short. We sin every day. I don't care whether it's
murder, whether it's affairs or whatever. And we get over that. You
ask forgiveness and you go on. So to let you know from here, you
have my forgiveness. Because we all fall short.''
</P>
<P>
   Several others agreed. One advised her to let go of her feelings
for Ms. Tripp, saying, ``Whatever goes around comes around.''
Again, others chimed in, with ``It comes around'' and ``It does.''
</P>
<P>
   Just before she was excused from the grand jury, the forewoman
told her, ``Basically what we wanted to leave with, because this
will probably be your last visit to us, I hope I'm not going to
have to do this any more and I hope you won't have to come here any
more, but we wanted to offer you a bouquet of good wishes that
includes luck, success, happiness and blessings.''
</P>
<P>
   She again burst into tears and responded in kind, continuing the
lovefest: ``I appreciate all of your understanding for this
situation and your ability to open your heart and your mind and
your soul.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony and evidence released by Congress Monday
frequently presented Ms. Lewinsky in terms that make it easy to see
why the grand jury responded the way they did.
</P>
<P>
   She is shown surrounded by federal agents in January at the Ritz
Carlton Hotel and berated by assistants to special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr who wanted her to testify against the president. They
threatened her with jail and made fun of her for wanting her
``mommy.'' (The evidence also makes clear that Ms. Lewinsky did her
part to lighten the load on the American taxpayer, paying for her
own dinner with the agents at Mozzarella's American Grill that
evening and even forking over $2 for coffee to the men who were
pressing her to wear a wire.)
</P>
<P>
   She had enough presence of mind to respond to the surprise
appearance of Starr's team with legal questions: If the Paula Jones
sexual harassment suit went away, would she still be in legal
jeopardy? What if, theoretically speaking, she had not always told
Ms. Tripp the truth? She also thought to question the choice of her
father's friend and lawyer Bill Ginsburg as her attorney, worrying
because he was a medical malpractice lawyer inexperienced in
criminal cases.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when her mother, Marcia Lewis, finally did arrive, she
was clearly worried sick for her daughter, telling the Starr team
that Ms. Lewinsky had been suicidal six years earlier and was young
for her age. Ms. Lewinsky later said she had been on
antidepressants since early in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   In all of her grand jury testimony, she comes across as
unfailingly loyal to the president, calling him her ``sexual
soulmate'' and saying of the affair, ``I think back on it, and he
always made me smile when I was with him. He was sunshine.''
</P>
<P>
   And she defended the president in a number of ways, insisting,
for example, that he would never have had sex in the Oval Office
itself. When asked whether the president said she should deny a
relationship, she answered, ``I think I always offered that.''
</P>
<P>
   She even cut him a break on what she refers to as ``D-Day _ Dump
Day,'' the day the president broke off their affair, saying he was,
``just really wanting to do the right thing in God's eyes and do
the right thing for his family.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   She is hard on herself in many ways, taking responsibility for
hectoring Clinton to get her a job, and presenting herself as so
pushy that she even dared suggest to the president what Hillary
Rodham Clinton should do to get him out of the Paula Jones sexual
harassment suit:
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought that first Mrs. Clinton should do something
publicly, maybe on a TV show or something, and talk about how
difficult the case had been for her and on her daughter and that
she just wished that he would settle it and it would go away. And
then the president should unannounced and unexpectedly go into the
briefing room'' and say that against his lawyers' advice, he had
decided to pay Mrs. Jones whatever she wanted just to get it over
with.
</P>
<P>
   She does defend herself on such subjects as why she kept the
blue dress stained with the president's semen. Ms. Tripp, she said,
suggested that she keep it as evidence. And when Ms Lewinsky
refused, Ms. Tripp told her she looked fat in it, so she never wore
it again, and didn't get around to having it cleaned. She says she
wore ``the infamous beret'' as the result of a bad-hair day.
</P>
<P>
   In her first grand jury appearance on Aug. 6, prosecutors were
much more willing to settle for a general description of what
occurred between the president and Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   By the Aug. 20 appearance, however, when prosecutors were
obviously matching Ms. Lewinsky's responses to the president's
grand jury testimony in an attempt to prove perjury, they were
asking such questions as, ``Were there times when the president
would touch you either on the breasts or in the genital area
directly to the skin or was it always through clothing?''
</P>
<P>
   The grand jurors seemed more interested in understanding Ms.
Lewinsky's motivations. One asked, ``Was it love or sexual
obsession?'' She answered that it was both, but ``more love.''
Another asked if she had truly believed ``anything real could have
come from this relationship?'' Yes, she said.
</P>
<P>
   And when she grew embarrassed, they were sorry for her. One
suggested that she try closing her eyes again, and another said,
``We won't look at you.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky responded ``Can I hide under the table? I had ...
and wanted ... I tried to ... I placed his genital next to mine and
I hoped that if he ... oh, this is too embarrassing.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the last questions put to her was whether she for any
reason would want to hurt the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' she said. ``I'm upset with him right now, but no, that's
the last thing in the world I want to do.''

 &HT;    Forex doesn't challenge request
 &HT;    By Kim Tyson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Attorneys for Austin Forex International Inc.
and former University of Texas kicker Russell Erxleben on Monday
did not challenge the state's request to put the company into
receivership.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a Travis County judge granted a request by the Texas
State Securities Board to put the foreign currency exchange trading
company into receivership and seize its bank accounts. Monday was
the first time Austin Forex could have filed for a hearing to
challenge the move.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't decided yet'' whether to ask for a hearing to
dissolve the receivership, said John Stratton, Erxleben's attorney.
``It will be several days before we decide what we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sept. 14, Austin Forex suddenly closed its doors, alarming
hundreds of investors and prompting the action by the state.
</P>
<P>
   According to former investors and employees, the company did
business with between 600 and 800 investors and handled as much as
$60 million before closing.
</P>
<P>
   In its Friday civil suit seeking the receivership, state
securities regulators claim Erxleben misled and defrauded
investors. The agency claims that besides losing investors' money
in bad foreign-currency trades, Erxleben personally used some of
the money to pay for a boat, health-club membership, cars and
personal investments.
</P>
<P>
   Through his attorneys, Erxleben has denied the claims.

ANALYSIS: DAMAGED CLINTON LIKELY TO REMAIN IN OFFICE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CRAGG HINES 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Whatever Americans thought before the videotape
about President Clinton and whether he should stay or go, they
probably feel almost exactly the same way today.
</P>
<P>
   The extraordinary four-hour display of a president under oath,
who was, by turns, defensive, dissembling and disingenuous,
probably does not move the bottom line. Clinton is likely to remain
in office, but his presidency has been damaged.
</P>
<P>
   If Clinton decides he wants to hang on at all costs _ and the
evidence points in that direction _ he can probably do that. But if
he believes he can retain a significant hold on the nation's trust
or belief in his word or character, he is likely deluding himself.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats will be watching the polls to confirm that the public
is locked into its view that Clinton should remain in office. They
will also be on the lookout for the prospect of a public backlash,
which would not only help the president in his quest to survive,
but also bolster the party's chances in critical elections Nov. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans will look for a long-awaited drop in Clinton's 60
percent job-approval ratings. Their hunt probably will be in vain,
for there was no smoking gun in Clinton's testimony or, as far as
can be ascertained quickly, the remainder of the evidence that was
released.
</P>
<P>
   Neither was there some magic exculpatory bullet to let the
president off the hook. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Clinton's grand jury testimony should confirm for even the
president's sturdiest defenders his extensive word-twisting
attempts to conceal the sleazy nature of his interludes with former
White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If doubts remain, they can consult the accompanying tomes of
details that were released by the House Judiciary Committee with
which the president's lawyers have not taken issue.
</P>
<P>
   But the president's partisans will argue that no matter how
deplorable his actions _ ``reprehensible'' was the White House's
word of choice Monday _ they were not impeachable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton defenders also will see the tape of Clinton's Aug. 17
grand jury testimony as evidence that independent counsel Kenneth
Starr and his deputies were overzealous and fixated on sex. They
will view it as harassment and humiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The president's detractors, on the other hand, will see his
testimony as an extended advertisement for why they believe he is
unfit to lead the nation. They think the videotape provides strong
proof of Clinton's moral turpitude and direct evidence of perjury
and witness tampering.
</P>
<P>
   The president's opponents will see the Starr team's probing,
insistent questions as the only way to attempt to break through
Clinton's continuing, impermeable stonewall.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little doubt that the House of Representatives is
headed toward a formal impeachment inquiry to explore those issues.
And both sides, nourished by their selective reading of national
polls, are likely to see that as an excuse for political blood
sport that will further alienate average Americans from the
political process.
</P>
<P>
   If his poll numbers hold, Clinton will stick to the ``this is
about you'' theme he used with a union crowd last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to make this a season for doing things for you, not
idleness and indulgence,'' Clinton told a friendly audience of the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers on Thursday. The
intended translation, of course, is that Republicans are too busy
wallowing in details of the scandal and their personal distaste for
Clinton to get on with the nation's business.
</P>
<P>
   Democrats on Capitol Hill do not assume that will do the trick,
either with the voters or in Clinton's attempt to govern for the
next 28 months. And while many Democrats in Congress will defend
Clinton in principle, they may be less eager to embrace him
personally.
</P>
<P>
   The White House was cheered by Clinton's favorable reception
Monday when he walked onto the podium at the United Nations to give
his annual address to the General Assembly. But presidential aides
also knew that Clinton was about to address a room full of
politicians who may have been thinking: ``There, but for the grace
of God, go I.''
</P>
<P>
   The White House is not conceding the inevitability of the House
moving to a full impeachment inquiry, but Clinton advisers are
looking for a way to short-circuit the process.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Mike McCurry said Monday that the
administration is ``actively talking to a range of people who are
in leadership roles in this country about how we can get the right
course of action to occur.'' In other words: let's make a deal
about censure.
</P>
<P>
   Any attempts to reach some negotiated conclusion to the scandal
depend in large part on the public's attitude, as reflected in
upcoming polling. But as things stand, the public wants this to end
more quickly than it is likely to.
</P>
<P>
   The White House, in wringing its hands about the release and
airing of the videotape, tried to tap into public disgust with the
affair as well as the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   McCurry said it was ``an unnecessary day in the life of our
country, an awful day.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was also a day brought on the nation by an irresponsible
president as much as an aggressive independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The tape also raises the question of how much humiliation this
president can take. And the answer, if the alternative is
relinquishing office, is a lot.

   JAPAN'S PRIME MINISTER CITES OTHERS' COSTLY ERRORS
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi of Japan blamed his predecessor, the
nation's powerful Finance Ministry, and the heads of the country's
huge financial institutions for wasting years before the country
began to deal with its crippling banking crisis and a deep
recession that is worsening the world's economic turmoil.
</P>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If it is true, as everyone from Adam Smith to Disraeli and
Napoleon has said, that the British are a nation of shopkeepers,
why can't they keep shop more successfully in America?
</P>
<P>
   The language is the same and, on the surface anyway, consumer
tastes seem similar enough _ both nations, for example, embraced
the Spice Girls with unfathomable zeal.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, London has been a locus of hip, with its fashion
designers basking in the international limelight and stores like
Saks Fifth Avenue importing British cool for their shelves.
</P>
<P>
   One success story is that of the Virgin Group, which started
with an airline and has added music stores, a soft drink, various
entertainment media and now even clothes as part of its U.S.
operations.
</P>
<P>
   But for most British merchants, the hop across the pond has not
been easy. Many have tried their hand in the United States and
failed, like Conran's Habitat, a housewares chain that is now
defunct, and Next, a trendy clothing store.
</P>
<P>
   Others made a splash and then struggled mightily, most notably
Laura Ashley Holdings PLC , which has been through management
turmoil in the last two years, and Body Shop International, which
was recently forced to form a joint venture with Bellamy Retail
Group LLC to stay in business in the United States after bleeding
cash for years.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons are many, ranging from Americans' desire for a
bargain to real estate mistakes by British retail companies. And
then there is the sheer vastness of the U.S. marketplace, where the
mall is king and competition can upset the market in the time it
takes to finish afternoon tea.
</P>
<P>
   ``What English companies don't understand is that America is a
much more dynamic marketplace and much more competitive than the
U.K.,'' said Ranjit Singh, a former vice president of business
development for the Body Shop who now runs a food business in
London. ``You have to have deep pockets to roll out a concept very
quickly there, and have a very aggressive marketing strategy.''
</P>
<P>
   High-growth U.S. retailers tend to get started by opening in a
few markets, backed by venture capital money. Once the stores gain
acceptance, the retailer moves quickly _ often after a successful
public offering or after being bought out _ by sprinkling new
stores around the nation's malls and downtown shopping districts
like so many flower seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.S., there is a very active venture capital community
focused on the retail industry,'' said Henry Jackson, a managing
director at Peter J. Solomon, an investment bank that specializes
in retailing. ``It is a very different business culture in U.K.
They have had very few examples of entrepreneurship in retail, and
from the standpoint of venture capital and small companies going
public, there is less of a focus.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, British merchants often have trouble choosing real
estate in the vast United States, so different from England, where
London rules the roost and most other cities have one concentrated
shopping district.
</P>
<P>
   Habitat, which began in Britain in 1964 under Sir Terence Conran
and was a success there, would have seemed like a natural export
for the United States _ years later, two home-grown chains, the
Pottery Barn and Crate and Barrel, have had wild success here with
fairly inexpensive, trendy housewares.
</P>
<P>
   But Habitat put one of its Manhattan stores in midtown, in the
Citicorp Building on East 53rd Street, an expensive site that was
hardly a spot for casual browsing. Similarly pricey spots were
chosen in Philadelphia, Washington and Boston, and most stores had
trouble generating enough in sales to support the rent.
</P>
<P>
   Marvin Traub, the former chief executive of Bloomingdale's,
acquired the chain for what he said was a song in 1992, but quickly
saw that solving other problems _ poor inventory management, for
example _ could not compensate for being in the wrong locations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Prime real estate can be very expensive in America,'' said
Traub, who eventually shut the chain down. He now runs his own
consulting firm and is a senior adviser to the investment bank
Financo. ``In order to pay rents in good malls or in spaces on
Madison Avenue, you have to have extraordinarily high productivity
per square foot,'' he said. ``It became clear it would be cheaper
for us to liquidate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sir Terence, Conran's founder, declined to comment, but he has
confirmed plans to open a store in New York again soon _ this one
with upscale furniture, a specialty foods market and maybe a
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond real estate and venture capital, another part of the
problem for the British is that they are not used to dealing with
malls. In general, if a British store opens on a busy high street _
their term for main street _ it is assured a fairly steady flow of
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the U.K. you put one store in the middle of a town and
capture the whole town,'' said Simon Wright, chief executive of the
U.S. and British Virgin record chains, a unit of Virgin. ``That
can't be done in the U.S. For instance, we have been looking at
Atlanta, and there are six strong malls there. Which one do you
choose? You can easily put the store down in wrong locations.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Virgin, an exception to the rule, has been slower to expand
than most U.S. retailers.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is expert in overcoming the biggest issue of all: how
to get shoppers into the store. Despite their insatiable appetite
for new products, Americans are quite brand loyal, and drawing them
into an emporium that they have never heard of requires huge
marketing budgets or another method of brand building. But many
British retailers skimp on advertising; the Body Shop, for example,
does almost none.
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer PLC, a national institution where half the
population of England buys its underwear, opened stores in Canada
25 years ago and learned an expensive lesson: it is very hard to
translate that feeling to another nation of consumers who already
have their favorite place to buy basic necessities.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a big mistake trying to take a British retailer to
Canada,'' admitted Chris Littmoden, the company's chief executive
for North American operations. ``They saw us as a bit
old-fashioned.'' Nevertheless, the effort continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't try it in the U.S.,'' Littmoden added. ``It would
be a mistake to bring in a brand that they didn't know. So we did
the next best thing, which was to buy Brooks Brothers.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Marks &AMP; Spencer's acquisition of the troubled Brooks Brothers
chain a decade ago was not a snap, either. Littmoden said he was
surprised that Americans wanted a much larger variety of sleeve
lengths, much more attentive customer service and a wider selection
of goods than most British specialty stores offer. Fine-tuning the
chain has taken longer than expected, and only recently has Marks &AMP;
Spencer begun to see some returns.
</P>
<P>
   If brand loyalty is a problem, fashion trends in general are a
quagmire. The clothier and household decor store Laura Ashley had
its moment in the 1980s when Americans turned briefly to chintz,
but it bogged down in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura Ashley is a disaster,'' said Mark Husson, a Briton who
is an analyst at Merrill Lynch in New York. ``There was a period
when every design magazine had their fabrics and it was highly
successful. But frilly English styles were a trend and fad.''
</P>
<P>
   Laura Ashley has tried to add modern designs and fabrics to its
mix, but has so far yet to hit the mark.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side is the Virgin Group, which has built the Virgin
brand in a classically American way _ by adding more and more
products _ under its flamboyant chief executive, Richard Branson.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken an much more American approach, which is to be
bold, noisy and loud about the brand,'' said Wendy Liebmann, a
retail consultant in New York. ``Others have taken a much more
traditional view that the consumer will love us forever if we
provide a quality product, which is truer in British culture. In
this county, it's `What have you done for me lately?' ''
</P>
<P>
   Fresh product is indeed what drives U.S. retailing. It is also
one of the areas in which the Body Shop ran into trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Several years after the Body Shop enticed Americans with its
body lotions and fruity scrubs, Limited Inc., the retailing
behemoth based in Columbus, Ohio, jumped into the game with Bath
and Body Works, a store it began rolling into malls in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Bath and Body Works started to eat into Body Shop's market by
constantly changing products (raspberry-scented lines one week,
antibacterial collections the next), by entering as many malls as
possible as quickly as possible and by keeping prices lower through
carefully managing production.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, the Body Shop introduced new products at a glacial
pace, lost control of many stores through franchising them and kept
a complicated supply base grounded on environmental and political
goals that often took a long time to translate into products.
``Americans like 10 different varieties of everything,'' said Anita
Roddick, the company's founder. ``We lost our sense of being ahead
of the curve.''
</P>
<P>
   Newness, or being special, was also a challenge for Next, which
sells basic clothing in more than 300 outlets but was unable to
make a profit with its five U.S. stores largely because American
customers had no compelling reason to bypass the Gap or Macy's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next didn't have any broad customer appeal,'' said Tony
Shiret, a retail analyst with Credit Suisse First Boston in London.
``It buys all its clothes in the Far East. Its product is safe
fashion. It is not distinct.'' The company, which is now disbanding
its U.S. operations, declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Other dark hours for British retailers trying to make it in the
United States have resulted from the U.S. clamor for bargains.
Littmoden of Marks &AMP; Spencer, which also operates Kings
Supermarkets in New Jersey, noted that coupons are hardly used in
Britain but are an integral part of grocery shopping in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   America is one of the few countries that slap markdown tags on
clothes that are still in season, often because ordering cycles are
far ahead of Europe's. The United States also has a special love
for gifts given with purchases and the semi-phony two-for-one deals
that are common in many stores in the mall, such as the endless
five-for-the-price-of-three panties sale at the American-owned
Victoria's Secret.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is pricing structure,'' said Husson, the analyst
from Merrill Lynch. ``A large percentage of product is sold on
clearance, and the overall achieved gross margin is much lower.
England is a more static retail environment.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The scene at the Supper Club on West 47th Street
seemed to evoke the glory days of jazz _ an ebullient swing band
playing classic Ellington tunes as dancers in period costumes
rocketed around the dance floor.
</P>
<P>
   But rather than a throwback to the past, the filming for a PBS
special was a snapshot of the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra as one
of the great cultural success stories in New York. In just a decade
Jazz at Lincoln Center has become the flagship jazz organization in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Led by Wynton Marsalis, the most celebrated jazz musician of his
time, it is scheduled to move to the kind of coveted location that
comes along only once every few decades.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has highlighted the growth of Jazz at Lincoln Center, a
constituent of the center for only two years, as much as the
announcement in July that the redevelopment plans for Columbus
Circle will include an 1,100-seat concert hall and complex of
offices and rehearsal rooms for the program. The concert hall is
billed as the first to be acoustically designed for jazz.
</P>
<P>
   But the growth of Jazz at Lincoln Center, whose new season is in
full swing, is also a reminder of the program's ambitious agenda
and its contentious place in the jazz world.
</P>
<P>
   Jazz at Lincoln Center is not just about making music. It is
also, very consciously, about making choices, about defining the
canon of an art form that is less than a century old. That goal has
almost inevitably brought controversy and with it a question at the
heart of the program's mission: Does it exist mostly to celebrate
jazz's past or should it be helping to shape its future as well?
</P>
<P>
   By almost any conventional measure, Jazz at Lincoln Center has
been an astounding success. The program's budget has grown in three
years from $3 million to $9 million, and this year it will present
nearly 400 concerts, lectures, classes and workshops in New York
and around the world. Most concerts play to sold-out houses.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Marsalis became the first jazz artist to win a
Pulitzer Prize for music. On Friday he played and spoke in a
program at the White House. Officials are confident they will be
able to raise the $65 million it will take to build their new home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a marvelous job, and incorporating jazz on an
equal basis at Lincoln Center is very important,'' said Dan
Morgenstern, director of the Institute of Jazz Studies at Rutgers
University. ``Jazz has never had a space like the one at Columbus
Circle. It's quite wonderful what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   But in the jazz world, which often is as factionalized as a lost
Trotskyist tribe, the reviews are more mixed.
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of many criticisms is the sense that Jazz at
Lincoln Center is using its bully pulpit to foster a cautious,
unadventurous view of what jazz is. Given Marsalis' celebrity and
commercial success, its programming is having an effect beyond
Lincoln Center to help determine what kind of jazz and jazz
musicians are recorded and promoted.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics and musicians say that the program's commissions
have too often gone to Marsalis, that he has used his influence to
polarize the jazz world and that the program has slighted white
artists at the expense of a pointedly Afrocentric view of jazz's
history and traditions.
</P>
<P>
   Most pervasive is the criticism that Lincoln Center is purveying
a cautious, static and dated approach to jazz.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've done a lot to take the essence of jazz and distort it;
they've put a damper on the main ingredient of jazz, which is
innovation,'' said George Russell, a much-admired jazz composer and
pianist who has been an important figure in jazz since working with
Dizzy Gillespie in the 1940s. ``I think whatever happens at Lincoln
Center, history will have to correct it, because it does need
correcting terribly.''
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just a window onto Jazz at Lincoln Center, the
disputes are highlighting two vexing issues in jazz overall.
</P>
<P>
   The first is the generational flip-flop in which most of the
innovators are in their 40s, 50s and 60s, while the most
conspicuous younger musicians, modeled after Marsalis, are viewed
as polished, cautious traditionalists.
</P>
<P>
   The second is the ill-defined cultural status of jazz, with some
skeptics questioning whether it belongs at Lincoln Center and
others questioning whether it will inevitably be watered down
because it is there.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis said the criticisms, which have played out in the jazz
press almost since the program began, are old issues recycled too
many times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ellington faced this; Coltrane had to defend himself in
writing,'' he said. ``There's always some side story that becomes
the issue instead of the music. And my whole thing is: What about
the music?''
</P>
<P>
   The writer Stanley Crouch says the criticisms reflect envy more
than substance. Crouch has helped define the program's approach,
along with Marsalis, the author Albert Murray, and Rob Gibson, who
is executive producer and director of Jazz at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a classic Rolls driving by on a hot day and a
guy standing in the sun waiting for a bus, that guy is going to
have one of two reactions,'' Crouch said. ``Either the Rolls is no
good or he should be driving it. Most of the criticisms come down
to either `I'm not being hired there,' or `My ideas are not being
adopted.'''

<P>
   After Just 11 Years, an Equal Partner
</P>
<P>
   Beginning with a three-concert jazz program in 1987, Jazz at
Lincoln Center became a department, dependent on Lincoln Center for
money in 1991, and in 1996 became the 12th independent constituent
on an equal footing _ if not with equal resources _ with powers
like the New York Philharmonic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had astounding growth, and it's the result of the
incredible power of this music,'' said Gordon Davis, the program's
chairman, a former city parks commissioner and now a powerful
real-estate attorney. ``We're all riding a mission here because
we're involved in something we believe is profoundly important,
which is this music, in this country at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   The mission translates to acclaimed education programs,
particularly those taught by Marsalis. And the Lincoln Center Jazz
Orchestra has the most extensive touring schedule at Lincoln
Center, with 90 cities on five continents this year.
</P>
<P>
   The program's mission also consciously extends to trying to
define what jazz is. Marsalis and Gibson argue that just as
European music has an established canon of essential music, jazz
too needs to establish its own canon, with Louis Armstrong, Duke
Ellington, Charlie Parker and others as its version of Bach, Mozart
and Beethoven.
</P>
<P>
   Many jazz fans, particularly those in the large group more
likely to hear jazz at a concert hall than a downtown club, find it
hard to fathom what could be wrong with a vibrant jazz presence at
the leading American performing arts complex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone doing as much as they're doing to promote the
appreciation and respect and love of the music is doing the right
thing,'' said Richard Cohen, a creative director at a Manhattan
advertising agency.
</P>
<P>
   But in the jazz world the picture is far more mixed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What they do there sounds so old,'' said Sonny Fortune, a
saxophonist who has played with Miles Davis and many others. ``I
want to get excited by music, but a lot of what they do there, you
can go to sleep on it. I don't know if I'd say absolutely that what
they do is bad for jazz, but surely, absolutely I wouldn't see it
as good.''
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, many musicians scoff at the notion that it is the
role of Lincoln Center to establish a canon for jazz, saying such a
canon evolves naturally and that Lincoln Center's version is pallid
and limited.
</P>
<P>
   Others say Lincoln Center's institutional heft and commercial
muscle has distorted the economics of the jazz business.
</P>
<P>
   Other Musicians Find Less Work
</P>
<P>
   Marty Khan, whose company, Outward Visions, has represented jazz
artists and promoted jazz concerts and events for more then two
decades, said that when he started, colleges and arts groups used
to program four to 12 jazz events a year, paying $4,500 to $7,500.
Now many just do a few dates, usually including one by Marsalis or
the Lincoln Center Jazz Orchestra at several times that cost.
</P>
<P>
   This results in less work for other artists and audiences weaned
on classical, mainstream jazz rather than more adventurous fare.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Osby, a saxophonist who has moved between mainstream jazz
and more progressive jazz, said the passions about Lincoln Center's
direction have cooled since they were the talk of jazz a few years
back, partly because not many musicians outside what he described
as ``a select few people who pander to a certain taste and
ideology'' now expect to play there.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's plenty of resentment, but everyone has come to the
conclusion that no matter who gripes, it's not going to change
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that most artists realized that Lincoln Center did not
represent all of jazz, just one facet of it, and that venues more
partial to experimentation could flourish at the same time. Still,
he said, given its visibility and resources, many musicians wish
Jazz at Lincoln Center had a broader vision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jazz is a living art form that feeds on contemporary trends,
steps across fences, borrows from alien sources and brings them
back in a new way,'' he said. ``You have people doing incredible
things today, but they never get a chance to play at Lincoln Center
because they seem to think jazz stopped in 1967.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In a Black Forte, Race Is an Issue
</P>
<P>
   And in a field where racial issues, including questions about
whether whites can play jazz, have been tossed around for decades,
it's not surprising that some white musicians and critics say
Lincoln Center in its programming, tributes and commissions has
regularly slighted the contributions of white musicians. Of 16
musicians commissioned to create original music cited by Gibson,
four were white, one was Latino and the rest were black.
</P>
<P>
   The commissions range from $2,500 to $15,000. Marsalis, whose
composing gets more mixed notices than his playing, has been
commissioned to do a work every year but one since they began as
part of his contract. Gibson declined to say how much Marsalis is
paid.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis and Gibson dismiss any notion of a racial slant, and
others say that almost any fair reading of the giants of jazz would
have a preponderance of blacks. And Gibson said many criticisms
reflected the misimpression that Marsalis' work is synonymous with
Jazz at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think lots of the people who criticize us have never looked
at what we do,'' Gibson said. ``You can't look at the musicians
we've featured and say this is a predictable, narrow approach.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson cited musicians as diverse as Benny Carter, Ray Santos,
the Japanese conductor and arranger Katsuhiko Tanaka and Joe Lovano
as evidence of the range of works presented at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to a broad range of concerts, programming this year
includes a yearlong celebration of the centennial of Duke
Ellington's birth and collaborations with the New York Philharmonic
and New York City Ballet.
</P>
<P>
   Marsalis said he makes no apologies for making esthetic
judgments of what musicians to feature, decisions that have largely
tuned out both avant-gardists on one side and purveyors of pop jazz
or electric funk on the other.
</P>
<P>
   He said the focus on a jazz canon is not a static approach to
jazz but a way of establishing a bedrock of excellence that all
great players need to master before they can develop fully on their
own.

   ``If you're a writer, it's assumed that you should know
Shakespeare or Melville or Dickens,'' Marsalis said. ``But in our
field, for some reason, you had people saying to be great in jazz
you're not supposed to know anything. That's the view that was
prevalent when I was coming up, and that's what's helped to deplete
our field of musicians.''
</P>
<P>
   Some musicians say the real problem is not what Lincoln Center
does or doesn't do, but that so few others are trying to do the
same thing. There are plenty of jazz orchestras, including Jon
Faddis' Carnegie Hall Jazz Band, but no major arts institution has
made the commitment that Lincoln Center has to a continuing
presence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Wynton has to be himself; if Ornette Coleman was heading Jazz
at Lincoln Center, it would be very different,'' said Joe Lovano, a
white saxophonist, who received a Lincoln Center commission for a
work. ``What Wynton is doing is great. The trouble is you can't
expect them to do everything. What you'd like to see is for this to
springboard across the country, so that every city that has a major
symphony orchestra has a jazz orchestra as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the critics say Lincoln Center's role in many ways
mirrors the commercial currents of jazz in general and the
constraints of trying to run a nonprofit organization at high-cost
venues like Alice Tully Hall. Thus Lester Bowie, a trumpeter and
vocal critic of Marsalis, said he did not expect to play at Lincoln
Center because his work is more popular in Europe than in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson said much of the backbiting had reflected the inevitable
growing pains of a program starting with the most essential music
and slowly making its way through the rich panoply of the jazz
world.
</P>
<P>
   New Solutions in a New Home
</P>
<P>
   He said the new hall would allow Jazz at Lincoln Center to
present five to 10 times as much jazz in New York as the
organization has been able to do in the past, some of it in smaller
or less expensive spaces that will be more conducive to
commercially marginal fare.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot more musicians and a lot more of the jazz
community we want to put on our stage,'' he said. ``I mean we're
just getting to Hank Jones. This is one of the most important jazz
musicians of our time. He's 80 years old, and we've never had him
on our stage. We're not trying to be politically correct. It just
takes time to get to everyone we'd like to have. People forget that
we're a very young organization in a very young art form. We're at
the mezzanine level of a 20-story building.''

FORMER OLYMPIC CHAMPION `FLOJO' DIES AT AGE 38 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By DANNY ROBBINS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Former Olympic sprinter Florence Griffith Joyner, who combined
speed and style a decade ago to become one of the most enduring
figures in her sport, died suddenly Monday in Southern California
at the age of 38.
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Hector Rivera of the Orange County (Calif.) sheriff's office
said Griffith Joyner, who won three gold medals at the 1988
Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, had ``passed away during the
night.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the sheriff's office, a 911 call was received early
Monday from Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, also an Olympic
gold medalist. Joyner reported that his wife was ``unresponsive and
not breathing.''
</P>
<P>
   An autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Greg Foster, a three-time world champion in the 110-meter
hurdles who was at one time engaged to Griffith Joyner, said he was
told by family members that Griffith Joyner died of a heart-related
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Griffith Joyner suffered a heart seizure on a
flight from California to St. Louis, where she was due to appear at
a track meet for high school athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her history of heart trouble, Griffith Joyner's death
was stunning news to those who knew her as ``FloJo'' and had seen
her dominate the women's sprints 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all have to realize we're just people with a certain
talent,'' said Carl Lewis, who was a member of the 1984 and '88
U.S. Olympic teams with Griffith Joyner. ``It's a tremendous blow
to everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner became a prominent figure on the world track and
field scene in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   At the Olympic Trials that year in Indianapolis, she lowered the
world record in the 100 meters to 10.49 seconds; no woman has
approached that time since. In Seoul, she captured gold medals in
the 100 and 200 meters (taking the final in 21.34, a world record
that also still stands) and the 400-meter relay.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner's husband was the 1984 Olympic gold medalist in
the triple jump. Her sister-in-law, Jackie Joyner-Kersee, is a
six-time Olympic medalist and the world-record holder in the
heptathlon. Joyner-Kersee's husband, Bob Kersee, served as Griffith
Joyner's coach until after the 1988 Olympic Trials, when Al Joyner
took over the job.
</P>
<P>
   More than anything else, Griffith Joyner made a name for herself
with a style that included colorful, skin-tight bodysuits and long,
elaborately polished fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   One of the outfits she wore at the 1988 Olympic Trials was a
purple bodysuit with a bikini brief over it.
</P>
<P>
   Fellow American sprinter Gwen Torrence once said of Griffith
Joyner: ``If you're going to be wearing those outfits, you'd better
be doing something in them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Seoul, she painted three of her fingernails red, white and
blue. She painted a fourth gold, signifying her goal for the Games.
</P>
<P>
   ``She revolutionized the way athletes dress,'' said Craig
Masback, executive director of USA Track and Field. ``Her flair and
everything else she did captured the imagination.''
</P>
<P>
   The sleek outfits also underscored Griffith Joyner's
bodybuilder's physique _ a physique she did not appear to have in
1987, when her only medal at the world championships was a silver
in the 200 meters. Although the transformation led to talk of
steroid use, Griffith Joyner insisted she did not use
performance-enhancing drugs, and she never failed a drug test.
</P>
<P>
   Evelyn Ashford, who competed with Griffith Joyner in the sprints
throughout the 1980s, was still in awe of her rival's 1988 efforts
when she reminisced Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if I'll ever be able to put it in perspective,''
Ashford said. ``She just had a great year. I don't know what to
say. She changed the way a lot of people perceived the women's 100
meters.''
</P>
<P>
   Ashford added that Griffith Joyner's performance in 1988 gave
track and field ``a flash and a flair that we didn't have, which
was probably good for the sport and got attention for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Primo Nebiolo, head of the International Amateur Athletic
Federation (track's international organizing body), said: ``I will
never forget this extraordinary athlete who stunned the world in
Seoul 10 years ago with her amazing sprints and spectacular
outfits. Sadly, her life has passed as rapidly as her races.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner retired from track and field after the Seoul
Games. She designed and modeled clothes, wrote children's books,
performed in movies and on television, endorsed products and was a
public speaker. One of her projects was designing uniforms for the
Indiana Pacers of the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   She also served for a time as co-chair of the President's
Council on Physical Fitness.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, she was flying from California to St. Louis when she
suffered a seizure. She was hospitalized for one day. At the
family's request, no other details were released.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner was accompanied on that trip by her husband and
the couple's daughter, Mary. They were traveling to the St. Louis
area to attend the Jackie Joyner-Kersee Relays for high school
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner grew up in the Watts section of Los Angeles in a
family of 11 children. She graduated from Jordan High School in Los
Angeles in 1978, attended Cal State Northridge for two years and
graduated from UCLA in 1983 with a degree in psychology. She and Al
Joyner were married in October 1987.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Hybl, president of the U.S. Olympic Committee, issued a
statement calling Griffith Joyner's death a jolt to the sports
world.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence Griffith Joyner will be remembered among America's
greatest Olympians,'' he said, ``and she will be recalled with the
legends, like Wilma Rudolph and Babe Didrikson Zaharias.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Olympic movement is saddened and stunned by her passing.
She was a role model for young girls and women in sport, and her
legacy will be one that includes kindness and interest in children
and their dreams. `FloJo' will be missed tremendously.''
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, in a statement released in New York, also
noted Griffith Joyner's commitment to helping youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Though she rose to the pinnacle of the world of sports, she
never forgot where she came from, devoting time and resources to
helping children _ especially those growing up in our most
disadvantaged neighborhoods _ make the most of their own talents,''
Clinton said.

IN LA, HER DEATH HITS HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAN SHAUGHNESSY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WESTWOOD, Calif. _ Standing on the track where they trained
together for eight years, Jeanette Bolden talked about Florence
Griffith Joyner, the mercurial ``FloJo'' who died of apparent heart
seizure at the age of 38 Monday morning in Mission Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bolden and FloJo first met when they were in high school,
competing against one another in meets around Los Angeles. In the
late 1970s, they joined forces at Cal State-Northridge where they
lived and trained together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence could cook very, very well,'' said Bolden, now
women's track coach at UCLA. ``We looked forward to the nights when
it was her turn to cook. I remember one night she made seafood. I'm
allergic to seafood and my eyes got all swollen. She got me
sunglasses. I remember that. I remember the laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   All around Greater Los Angeles Monday, people were remembering
the laughter, the speed, the style, and the mystery of FloJo.
Griffith Joyner became a worldwide star when, often wearing
one-legged tights, she won three gold medals at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics. She was ``Flo Glo,'' but folks in Los Angeles still think
of her as the hometown girl who impressed and shocked the world.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner was born in LA, seventh of 11 children, and
raised in the rugged Jordan Housing Project of Watts. Her parents
split when she was 4, and two years later, riots almost burned
Watts to the ground. Still, in interviews before and after the '88
Games, Griffith Joyner recounted happy memories of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   She hooked up with Bolden at Cal State-Northridge and both moved
over to UCLA, where they helped the Bruins win a couple of NCAA
track championships. Bolden won a gold medal in the 1984 LA
Olympics, while FloJo settled for a silver in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, FloJo shattered the 100-meter world record,
won three golds, and created a legacy with outrageous outfits that
made her an international star. She put women's sprinting on the
map, and two of her records (100 and 200) were still standing when
she died.
</P>
<P>
   On the UCLA campus, students were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in the best shape of anybody in the world,'' said a
student standing outside Elvin C. Drake Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Mehlberg, a senior member of the track team, said, ``I
remember her running in the LA Olympics. It's shocking. She was so
young and seemed so fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolden, at 38 the same age as FloJo, said, ``I was pretty
shocked. Greg Foster called me at 7:30 this morning. I had talked
to Florence about three weeks ago. She had just come back from
overseas. She seemed fine.''
</P>
<P>
   FloJo is scheduled to be enshined in the UCLA Sports Hall of
Fame during a football game against Washington State at the Rose
Bowl in two weeks. She is one of 12 new inductees, and will take
her place alongside Bill Walton, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jimmy
Connors, Dot Richardson, Rafer Johnson, Jackie Robinson, and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, in life and death, FloJo was stalked by rumors of illegal
substance use. She never failed a drug test, but her stunning
performances in Seoul prompted suspicion of anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Bolden, a good friend to the finish line, was evasive _ almost
Clintonesque _ in her response to speculation about steriods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what to say about that,'' said Bolden.
``Athletes are determined individuals. Anything other than that is
something I don't want to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. If Bolden was convinced FloJo was 100 percent clean, it
would be easy to spike the speculation. Instead, she wavered,
making us wonder whether she fears what might come out. Bolden,
after all, is a championship track coach at a major university.
Good friend or no, she has to be able to answer to her young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence was a very dedicated person,'' remembered Bolden.
``She's still a world record-holder and that's what athletes aspire
for. And, of course, her flair for fashion was always there. I
remember in high school, I saw her team and they were all in white
tights. They were the only team dressed like that and it was her
idea. It was the same when we lived and trained together. Before a
meet, everyone would be nervous, but Florence would be painting her
fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   While she spoke on this gray Monday in Los Angeles, the UCLA
track was sprinkled with dozens of college athletes _ all of them
young women.

LINDA TRIPP ADVISED MONICA TO KEEP INFAMOUS DRESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ They were close friends, so close that the younger
woman could confide in the older woman some of her most intimate
secrets about a dangerous affair she was having with a married man.
</P>
<P>
   And the older woman did not hesitate to pass on some motherly
advice.
</P>
<P>
   It was Linda Tripp who recommended to Monica Lewinsky that she
hang on to the now infamous blue dress stained from an encounter
with the president, Lewinsky testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``And she told me that I should put it in a safe deposit box
because it could be evidence one day,'' Lewinsky said.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I said that was ludicrous because I would never _ I would
never disclose that I had a relationship with the president. I
would never need it.''
</P>
<P>
   Although no transcripts of her tapes or testimony were included
in Monday's document release, Tripp recorded more than 40 telephone
conversations with Lewinsky, 38 times on her own and twice while
cooperating with the FBI. Copies of some e-mail messages between
the two friends were included in the 2,800 pages of material
released Monday with the videotape of Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   In chatty, even schoolgirlish electronic messages, Lewinsky and
Tripp shared laughs and then lunched regularly as Lewinsky came to
rely on Tripp's advice in trying to deal with the ups and downs of
her relationship with Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Once, early in 1997, when Clinton ignored Lewinsky for a time,
Lewinsky e-mailed Tripp of her worries about the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank God for you!'' she wrote to Tripp. ``I don't know what
I'm going to do. I just don't understand what went wrong, what
happened? How could he do this to me?''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp wrote back with reassurance: ``Do not despair, there is
most definitely light at the end of this tunnel.''
</P>
<P>
   Tripp also collected newspapers containing a Valentine message
that Lewinsky wrote for the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``It read beautifully,'' Tripp complimented Lewinsky.
``Placement was great, typeface totally effective and text
superlative . . . good job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Lewinsky returned from a vacation shortly after the ad's
publication, she wrote to Tripp, ``Hi. I missed you!'' (with four
exclamation points).
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Lewinsky complained that Clinton failed to
call even though ``the Babba,'' her name for Hillary Rodham
Clinton, was out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``HHHEEELLPPP!!!!'' she wrote to Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   But it was during these intimacies when Tripp may have been
plotting to turn on the younger woman, according to Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has said she did not set out to betray Lewinsky and was
only trying to do the right thing. But Tripp had already befriended
book agent Lucianne Goldberg to peddle an account of Tripp's last
moments with Vincent Foster, the deputy White House counsel who
shot himself in 1993. (Tripp was the last of his co-workers to see
him alive.)
</P>
<P>
   Tripp took copious notes on her phone conversations with
Lewinsky in handwritten pages torn from a small, spiral notebook.
</P>
<P>
   One notation Tripp made reads: ``6:00 (?) night he called at
home _ come over. romantic. If I win in Nov. I'll have you back
like that! fooled around. phone call from Dick Morris _ (oral sex)
on phone. Harold came in _ she went out and never (got a)
goodbye.''
</P>
<P>
   Even when they had a falling out over what to tell investigators
in the Paula Jones lawsuit, Lewinsky tried to maintain the
friendship and, unaware of the depth of Tripp's betrayal, ask for
her help in concealing the affair.
</P>
<P>
   In her testimony, Lewinsky repeatedly refers to Tripp's
intention to ``rat on me'' to lawyers for Paula Jones. By January
of this year, she had become suspicious of Tripp, Lewinsky
testified, but thought she still had a chance of persuading her to
keep mum about the affair with the president in any testimony in
the Jones suit.
</P>
<P>
   They arranged to meet for lunch at a mall. Tripp was beginning
to see Lewinsky's point of view, or so she thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was late. I saw her come down the escalator. And as I, as
I walked toward her, she kind of motioned behind her and (two
government agents) presented themselves to me,'' Lewinsky
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp had set her up, claiming it was for her own good, Lewinsky
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said that they had done the same thing to her and she
tried to hug me, and she told me this was the best thing for me to
do.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Lewinsky made it plain in her testimony to the
independent counsel how she feels about Tripp. At the end of her
Aug. 20 testimony, Lewinsky is asked by a grand juror if there is
anything she wanted to add or clarify. Lewinsky said she wanted to
make sure jurors knew that no one asked her to lie and that she was
not promised a job for her silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that I'm sorry,'' she added, beginning to cry. ``I'm
really sorry for everything that's happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I hate Linda Tripp.'' &QL;

$1.8 BILLION SOUGHT FOR SECURITY AT U.S. EMBASSIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (Adds info. on balancing security needs against maintaining
accessibility of embassies; polishing and tightening throughout.)  
(See also TANZANIA-BOMBING) 
(js) 
 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration will ask Congress this
week for $1.8 billion for emergency security improvements at most
of the nation's 260 embassies and consulates worldwide, a
downpayment on protecting U.S. missions against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   That money, about twice the amount Congress has appropriated for
diplomatic security since 1985, reflects the administration's
conclusion that no country can be considered safe for U.S.
diplomats following the fatal bombings in East Africa last month.
</P>
<P>
   But the request is far below the full amount the State
Department has said is needed to modify or build embassies meeting
the security standards established in the 1980s. In 1985, the
department put the cost of converting or replacing all embassies at
$3.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   In his speech at the United Nations on Monday, President Clinton
spoke briefly of the new financing, saying that it would go ``to
repair our embassies, to improve security, to expand the worldwide
fight against terrorism, to help our friends in Kenya and Tanzania
with the wounds they have suffered.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the $1.8-billion request, which the White House is expected
to send to Congress on Tuesday, about $200 million would go toward
building embassies in Nairobi, Kenya, and Dar es Salaam, Tanzania,
to replace those demolished in the Aug. 7 bombings. Because the
construction could take two to three years, the money would also
finance temporary missions.
</P>
<P>
   Also, $1.2 billion was earmarked for emergency security
improvements in embassies worldwide, including additional security
guards, video cameras and other equipment to enhance security,
particularly around the perimeters of diplomatic missions.
</P>
<P>
   The remainder of the money would go toward reimbursing the
Pentagon for its costs in dealing with the bombings in East Africa;
increasing Secret Service protection of traveling U.S. dignitaries;
providing new anti-terrorism programs in countries where the United
States has diplomatic missions; and giving disaster relief for
Kenya and Tanzania, including payments to families of those killed
in the blasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we can keep big bombs from entering inside our compounds
and embassies, we'll reduce the risk of catastrophic collapses of
buildings,'' said an administration diplomatic security official.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers are expected to approve the request, half the sum that
the administration had originally suggested it would seek.
</P>
<P>
   Congressional aides said the proposed upgrades are likely to
fall short of the recommended security standards the State
Department set in the mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't barricade our way out of this new terrorist threat,''
said a senior House Republican aide. He said ``we need better and
timely intelligence'' on terrorists like those believed to be
associated with Osama bin Laden, the exiled Saudi accused of
orchestrating the embassy bombings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The emergency spending request was based largely on reports by
diplomatic security experts at U.S. missions worldwide and by
counterterrorism experts dispatched by the administration to 30
embassies worldwide. Administration officials, speaking on
condition that they not be identified, described the spending
proposal to reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials refused to identify the most vulnerable
embassies and declined to give details about the countermeasures
that they planned to deter and detect terrorist acts.
</P>
<P>
   Even as the administration champions better security, U.S.
officials noted that they were trying to balance U.S. diplomats'
safety against their concerns of turning some compounds into
formidable fortresses. ``There's an inherent need for our people to
be accessible,'' said a senior administration official.
</P>
<P>
   For weeks, White House and State Department officials have
negotiated with lawmakers over how much Congress would approve as
an emergency spending measure, and for what purposes.
Administration officials said Monday that after the first wave of
emergency improvements are made, other ongoing steps will be needed
to upgrade security in later appropriations.
</P>
<P>
   Even with strong bipartisan support, discussion of how to
finance the new security measures could become entangled in a much
broader political brawl over how to spend the government's budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has argued that the new security measures
should be considered emergency spending. In reality, Clinton would
have to pay for the new measures by dipping into the budget
surplus. That would put him at odds with his pledge to save every
penny of the surplus to finance Social Security. It would also open
him to criticism from Republicans who want to use some of the
surplus for big tax cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Fiscal hawks on Capitol Hill vowed Monday to vote against the
embassy security measures unless they are paid for by cuts
elsewhere in the administration's budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll certainly vote no, and will do everything in my power to
stop it,'' said Rep. Mark Neumann, R-Wis. and a member of the House
Appropriations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. David McIntosh, R-Ind. and head of the Conservative Action
Team, a group of about 45 House Republicans, said through a
spokesman that he supports the bolstered diplomatic security but
would oppose paying for it with the surplus.
</P>
<P>
   A State Department survey conducted after the East Africa
bombings found that about 220 of the 260 embassies and consulates
fall short of security standards and need improvements, an
administration official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   From 60 percent and 70 percent of all U.S. diplomatic missions
need to be farther from busy streets or sidewalks, adding that the
embassy in London and the consulate in Bombay were especially
worrisome. They are both located on busy thoroughfares and ``may
need to be relocated,'' the official said.

   ON ROMANCE
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK. Your relationship with the president, did your
mother at any time try to discourage the relationship?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh, yes.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Well, what kept it going? I mean, what kept it _ you
keeping it active or whatever?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I beg your pardon? I couldn't hear you.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I fell in love.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: When you look at it now, was it love or a sexual
obsession?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: More love with a little hit of obsession. But
definitely love.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Did you think that the president was in love with you
also?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: There was an occasion when I left the White House
and I was pretty stunned at how I felt because I did think that.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: You did?
</P>
<P>
   MICHAEL EMMICK (one of the Starr prosecutors): Do you remember
the date?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: It was July 4, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Were you aware that he was having problems in his
marriage? Did this ever spill over in the times that you were
together? Did you get a feeling that something was not right, that
_
</P>
<P>
   (An exchange regarding her answer has been deleted by the house
judiciary committee.)
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: And today, Monica, do you still love the president?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Before Monday, I would have said yea.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: So then it is no?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't know how I feel right now.
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: A question in the front?
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I guess I would like to know what happened Monday to
make you just by Thursday change your mind so completely.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't think it's so much changed my mind. I think
_ it's _ it was very painful for me to watch his speech on Monday
night. I _ it's _ it's hard for me to feel that he has
characterized this relationship as a service contract and that that
was never something that I ever thought it was. And _
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I'm sorry, you lost me already.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I'm sorry. I'm sorry. It's _ from my understanding
about what he testified to on Monday, not _ just from the press
accounts, is that this was a _ that this was a service contract,
that all I did was perform oral sex on him and that that's all that
this relationship was. And it was a lot more than that to me and I
thought it was a lot more than that.
</P>
<P>
   And I think I felt _ I was hurt that _ that he didn't even _
sort of acknowledge me in his remarks. And even also _ I mean, that
has to do with directly with me, but I thought he should have
acknowledged all the other people that have gone through a lot of
pain for seven months.
</P>
<P>
   I feel very responsible for a lot of what's happened, you know,
in the seven months, hut I tried _ I tried very hard to do what I
could to not _ to not hurt him. I'm still not answering your
question.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Well, let's _ you said the relationship was more than
oral sex. I mean, it wasn't like you went out on dates or anything
like that like normal people, so what more was it?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh, we spent hours on the phone talking. It was
emotional.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Phone sex?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Not always. On a few occasions. I mean, we were
talking. I mean, interacting. I mean, talking about what we were
thinking and feeling and doing and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   We were very affectionate, even when _ after he broke the
relationship off in May, I mean, when I'd go to visit with him,
we'd _ you know, we'd hug each other a lot. You know, he always
used to like to stroke my hair. He _ we'd hold hands. We'd smile a
lot. We discussed a variety _ you know, a wide range of things.
</P>
<P>
   So, I mean, it was _ there was a real component of a
relationship to it and I just _ I thought he had a beautiful soul.
I just thought he was just this incredible person and when I looked
at him I saw a little boy and _ I don't know what the truth is any
more.
</P>
<P>
   And that's, I think, what I took away on Monday, was that I
didn't know what the truth was. And so how could I know the truth
of my love for someone if it was based on him being an actor.
</P>
<P>
   HER MEMORY
</P>
<P>
   Q: How is it that you remember all the events in such detail
over really sort of what is a few years?
</P>
<P>
   A. I've always been a date-oriented person and I had a _
probably a habit of circling dates in my Filofax when I either
talked to the president _ or saw him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And did you provide those Filofax sheets to the Office of
Independent Counsel?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And did that assist you in remembering the dates?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes, it did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And were these encounters important to you?
</P>
<P>
   A. Very.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   LINDA TRIPP
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. How much about your relationship with the president did
you tell Linda Tripp?
</P>
<P>
   A: A lot. Most everything.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. And did you tell her about the sexual encounters that you
had with him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did you also tell her about the emotional encounters and the
gifts?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you truthful about the relationship when you told Linda
Tripp about it?
</P>
<P>
   A: Most of the time, but sometimes _ there were occasions when I
wasn't truthful.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were you truthful about the sexual parts of the relationship
with her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what about the emotional component, when you would tell
her _ and why don't I say before December of 1997, were you
truthful about the emotional components of the relationship?
</P>
<P>
   A. Yes.
</P>
<P>
   HER MOTHER
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Ms. Lewinsky, before you go into that, I just remember
you saying something with Linda Tripp, you know, what was not the
truth, OK? And I just remembered, was one of the things that you
told her, that you gave your mother the blue dress, one of the
untruths or was that true?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I don't know if I ever told Linda I gave my mom the
blue dress. One of the things I did say was that I gave everything
to my mom, so that probably included that and that was not true. I
didn't give the evidence to my mom. My mom never hid the dress. She
didn't know it was in New York.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: So she didn't know anything about it.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I've got one of those questions that goes along with
what she just said.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK. Fine. That's that idea. That topic.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: How much did your mom really know?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: She knew _ she knew that I was having a
relationship with the president. She knew that _ she knew that I
was certainly emotional about it and that it made me miserable a
lot and that sometimes I was elated and sometimes I was miserable,
but I didn't _ you know, I _ I might have said something to her
like, ``We fooled around,'' but I _ not _ she didn't know as much
as I led Linda to believe she knew. Is that _
</P>
<P>
   PAULA JONES
</P>
<P>
   Q: At some point, did you talk with him about possibly settling
the Paula Jones case?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, I had _ I had had a thought and then had a conversation
with Linda about this and just a way that he could settle the case
and I suggested it it to him.
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what was that way? Hot in a lot of detail, but _.
</P>
<P>
   A: The gist of it is, I thought that first Mrs. Clinton should
do something publicly, maybe on a TV. show or something, and talk
about how difficult the case had been for her and on her daughter
and that she just wished that he would settle it and it would go
away. And then the president should unannounced and unexpectedly go
into the briefing room, make a brief statement that he _ in an
effort to put this behind him, you know, against his attorneys'
advice, he was going to pay Ms. Jones whatever it was, however much
she wanted, and so that this case would be over with.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did the two of you talk about how much the settlement amount
would be or might be?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. I believe at some point I had mentioned that I had
recently read the _ I think she had lowered her _ the amount that
she wanted to $500,000 or something lower and he said, ``I thought
it was a million or two million dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   And I thought that was Very strange, that he wouldn't know she
had _ you know, that her lawyers _ or his lawyers had not told him
that she had lowered her request for money. Or I don't know how you
say that legally, whatever it is that she did.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Right. Demand. probably.
</P>
<P>
   A: The demand was lower.
</P>
<P>
   VERNON JORDAN
</P>
<P>
   Q: I think you also said you feel some _ I don't know if this is
the reason you don't remember it, but you have expressed to us that
you feel some guilt about Vernon Jordan. Is that correct?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mm-hmm.
</P>
<P>
   Q: That's a yes?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. Can you tell us why that is?
</P>
<P>
   A: He was the only person who did what he said he was going to
do for me and _ in getting me the job. And when I met with Linda on
the 13th, when she was wearing a wire, and even in subsequent or
previous conversations and subsequent conversations, I attributed
things to Mr. Jordan that weren't true because I knew that it had
leverage with Linda and that a lot of those things that I said got
him into a lot of trouble and I just _ he's a good person and _.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is one example of _ and then I'll leave this topic, is one
example of one of the things you told Linda that isn't true, ``I
told Vernon Jordan no job, no affidavit''? Something along those
lines?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. Because Linda made me promise her that on the 9th.
</P>
<P>
   Q: OK. Of January?
</P>
<P>
   A: Of January.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: I'm a little confused. When you said that you said
certain things because you know Linda had the mike, right?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh, I didn't know Linda had the mike. I now know
that she was wearing a wire.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: OK. But so why would you say these things about Mr.
Jordan that were not true? What was the reason?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Because _ I had _ from some of my conversation with
Linda. I started to think that she was a little bit jealous that
Mr. Jordan was helping me get a job in New York and that I was
leaving the Pentagon and that _ she had remarked one time that _
that, you know. Mr. Jordan who is the most powerful, you know, man
in this city got me my attorney and she _ she thinks that she only
had _ you know, this dinky attorney or something like that.
</P>
<P>
   And I was _ I was so desperate for her to _ I was _ for her to
not reveal anything about this relationship that I used anything
and anybody that I could think of as leverage with her. I _ her,
the president, my mom, everybody. I mean, not her, but Mr. Jordan,
the president, my mom. Anybody that I thought would have any kind
of influence on her, I used.
</P>
<P>
   Does that answer your question?
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Well, it doesn't. I guess what I'm trying to figure
out, OK, is what was that going to accomplish? Was that going to
make her _ what?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Well, specifically, with the statement about I
won't sign the affidavit until I get the job, is that I had a
conversation with Linda, which we'll probably get to _.
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: I hope.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Oh. On January 9th and in that conversation, she
had told me she had changed her mind. she was going to be vague on
the truth about Kathleen Willey and then she told me _ at that
point, I had told her I hadn't signed an affidavit when I had and I
told I didn't have a job yet and I knew I was probably going to be
getting a job that day.
</P>
<P>
   And she said, ``Monica, promise me you won't sign the affidavit
until you get the job. Tell Vernon you won't sign the affidavit
until you get the job because if you sign the affidavit before you
get the job, they're never going to give you the job.''
</P>
<P>
   And I didn't want her to think that I had gone ahead and done
anything without her and that I was leaving her in the dark. I
wanted her to feel that _ sort of Linda and myself against everyone
else because I felt like I needed to hold her hand through this in
order to try to get her to do what I wanted, essentially.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   `I WOULD ALWAYS DENY IT'
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Ms. Lewinsky, did you ever discuss with the president
whether you should delete documents from your hard drive, either at
the office or at home?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: No.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Nothing like that?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: No.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: Did you ever discuss with the president whether you
should deny the relationship if you were asked about it?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I think I always offered that. I think I've always
_
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: In discussions with the president?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: In discussions _ I told him I would always _ I
would always deny it, I would always protect him.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: And what did he say when you said that? What kind of
response did you receive?
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I said that often. I _ in my head, I'm seeing him
smile and I'm hearing him saying ``That's good,'' or _ something
affirmative. You know. Not _ not _ ``Don't deny it.''
</P>
<P>
   COORDINATING SCHEDULES
</P>
<P>
   (During questioning of Lewinsky by prosecutors on 7/30/98, Ms.
Lewinsky said that she called Betty Currie to arrange a meeting
with the president on May 24, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutors' notes show Lewinsky suggesting a deeper
involvement by Currie than she had supposed before:)
</P>
<P>
   ``Currie said that she had to check Mrs. Clinton's schedule and
said Mrs. Clinton was going to use the pool that day. This was the
only time that Lewinsky actually knew that Currie had factored in
the whereabouts of Mrs. Clinton with Lewinsky's visits to the
president. Mrs. Clinton never saw Lewinsky in the Oval Office.''
</P>
<P>
   CALL ME MONICA
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Can you guys call me Monica?
</P>
<P>
   Are they allowed to call me Monica instead of Ms. Lewinsky? I
was just _
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: If you say so.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: OK.
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: Sure.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: I'm just 25. Please.
</P>
<P>
   A JUROR: But you'll always be Ms. Lewinsky, whether you're 25 or
28 or _.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Not if I get married.
</P>
<P>
   THE SIGN-OFF
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: Basically what we wanted to leave with, because
this will probably be your last visit to us, I hope, I hope I'm not
going to have to do this any more and I hope you won't have to come
here any more, but we wanted to offer you a bouquet of good wishes
that includes luck, success, happiness and blessings.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Thank you. (The witness begins to cry.) I
appreciate all of your understanding for this situation and your _
your ability to open your heart and your mind and _ and your soul.
I appreciate that.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: So if there's nothing else?
</P>
<P>
   EMMICK: Nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   THE FOREPERSON: We'd like to excuse you and thank you very much
for your testimony.
</P>
<P>
   THE WITNESS: Thank you.

SPORTS COMMENTARY: DEATH AT 38: REVIEWING A VIBRANT LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late Monday afternoon, Bob Kersee and his wife, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee, had touched down in Los Angeles and were headed down
the freeway, headed toward the home that Jackie's brother, Al,
shared with his wife, Florence Griffith Joyner, and their 7-year
old daughter, Mary.
</P>
<P>
   They had taken this trip so many times for so many celebrations;
one triumph after another. The Joyners, the Griffiths, the Kersees.
This was a marriage of track nobility. Al Joyner, Jackie
Joyner-Kersee and Florence Griffth Joyner _ FloJo _ had shared so
many spectacular moments with each other, with the world. Now,
sudden and devastating news had ripped them all apart, and Monday's
trip down the freeway was one of the most dreaded drives of their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   Early in the morning, Jackie had received a phone call from
home. FloJo was dead.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jackie's brother called her and said that he was trying to
wake her up this morning,'' Bob Kersee said from his car phone.
``He couldn't wake her up; they called 911, the paramedics came
out. She had passed away.''
</P>
<P>
   There was silence on the line. What do you say at a time like
this? Florence Griffith Joyner was always alive, always fresh,
always vibrant. She was also flamboyant and controversial.
</P>
<P>
   FloJo ran like the wind; critics said she was wind aided. FloJo
ran with power; they say it was drug aided. FloJo ran with style;
critics said that with six-inch fingernails and bodysuits, her
career was a triumph of style over substance.
</P>
<P>
   Now Florence Griffith Joyner is gone, dead at the age of 38, and
there is nothing else to say. As news of her sudden death spread,
the collective reaction was disbelief.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm shocked,'' Kersee said. ``You don't expect to receive this
news, particular about one of your family members and an athlete
that you're coaching. You're just not prepared. It's pretty
difficult, it's devastating. Right now the family's got to come
together.''
</P>
<P>
   Kersee said that Al was so devastated that Mary, his daughter,
was the one who was calling people. ``When you've got a 6- or
7-year-old calling you and telling you that her mom's dead, it's
just difficult to take'' Kersee said.
</P>
<P>
   This month marks the 10-year anniversary of Joyner's stunning
performance at the Olympic Games. She won the 100- and 200-meter
races, breaking the world record in the 200. She had already set
the mark in the 100 in the Olympic trials. Each still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Yet those triumphs also marked the beginning of a controversy
that followed her, as it turned out, to her grave. Suspicions arose
that her performance was enhanced by steroids. How could she make
such a leap to such fast times _ a silver medalist in 1984 at 200
yards to a gold medalist and record-holder four years later? One
runner accused her of using growth hormones. Florence Griffith
Joyner never failed a drug test, never tested positive. She denied
ever using drugs.
</P>
<P>
   She left the sport for three years after 1984 and came back
stronger.
</P>
<P>
   There were also the running suits _ purple, covered by turquoise
bikini briefs _ and the 6-inch fingernails.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that her time was in '84,'' Kersee said. ``I
thought her time was in 1988. That's what happens in sport: how you
handle a loss will determine how great a champion you are going to
be or what kind or perennial loser you're going to become. She
handled the loss in 1984 in a way that told me she wanted to be a
champion in 1988.''
</P>
<P>
   In South Africa earlier this month Marion Jones became the only
other woman to run the 200 in under 21.70. Some feel that Jones may
be FloJo's salvation, that once Jones breaks the record, critics
will believe that you can surpass records, or hit home runs,
without drugs.
</P>
<P>
   But Kersee doesn't think the cloud will ever go away. ``To be
honest with you, no,'' he said. ``I think that people are going to
believe what they're going to believe. I thought that for a while.
People don't realize that what it comes down to desire and hard
work. There is something about human potential that we as humans
don't even understand about ourselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Kersee said that over his career as a triner and coach, he hd
seen a lot athletes retire, some before their prime, some after
their prime. But the notion of losing his sister-in-law at such an
early age was hard to take.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to deal withe that part of life's reality,'' Kersee
said. ``It's a great athlete that passed away today, but more
importantly it's a great human being. It's a mother, it's a wife,
it's a sister. That's what hurts.''

IN LA, HER DEATH HITS HOME

   WESTWOOD, Calif. _ Standing on the track where they trained
together for eight years, Jeanette Bolden talked about Florence
Griffith Joyner, the mercurial ``FloJo'' who died of apparent heart
seizure at the age of 38 Monday morning in Mission Viejo, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Bolden and FloJo first met when they were in high school,
competing against one another in meets around Los Angeles. In the
late 1970s, they joined forces at Cal State-Northridge where they
lived and trained together.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence could cook very, very well,'' said Bolden, now
women's track coach at UCLA. ``We looked forward to the nights when
it was her turn to cook. I remember one night she made seafood. I'm
allergic to seafood and my eyes got all swollen. She got me
sunglasses. I remember that. I remember the laughter.''
</P>
<P>
   All around Greater Los Angeles Monday, people were remembering
the laughter, the speed, the style, and the mystery of FloJo.
Griffith Joyner became a worldwide star when, often wearing
one-legged tights, she won three gold medals at the 1988 Seoul
Olympics. She was ``Flo Glo,'' but folks in Los Angeles still think
of her as the hometown girl who impressed and shocked the world.
</P>
<P>
   Griffith Joyner was born in LA, seventh of 11 children, and
raised in the rugged Jordan Housing Project of Watts. Her parents
split when she was 4, and two years later, riots almost burned
Watts to the ground. Still, in interviews before and after the '88
Games, Griffith Joyner recounted happy memories of childhood.
</P>
<P>
   She hooked up with Bolden at Cal State-Northridge and both moved
over to UCLA, where they helped the Bruins win a couple of NCAA
track championships. Bolden won a gold medal in the 1984 LA
Olympics, while FloJo settled for a silver in the 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, FloJo shattered the 100-meter world record,
won three golds, and created a legacy with outrageous outfits that
made her an international star. She put women's sprinting on the
map, and two of her records (100 and 200) were still standing when
she died.
</P>
<P>
   On the UCLA campus, students were stunned.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was in the best shape of anybody in the world,'' said a
student standing outside Elvin C. Drake Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Molly Mehlberg, a senior member of the track team, said, ``I
remember her running in the LA Olympics. It's shocking. She was so
young and seemed so fit.''
</P>
<P>
   Bolden, at 38 the same age as FloJo, said, ``I was pretty
shocked. Greg Foster called me at 7:30 this morning. I had talked
to Florence about three weeks ago. She had just come back from
overseas. She seemed fine.''
</P>
<P>
   FloJo is scheduled to be enshined in the UCLA Sports Hall of
Fame during a football game against Washington State at the Rose
Bowl in two weeks. She is one of 12 new inductees, and will take
her place alongside Bill Walton, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Jimmy
Connors, Dot Richardson, Rafer Johnson, Jackie Robinson, and
others.
</P>
<P>
   Sadly, in life and death, FloJo was stalked by rumors of illegal
substance use. She never failed a drug test, but her stunning
performances in Seoul prompted suspicion of anabolic steroids.
</P>
<P>
   Bolden, a good friend to the finish line, was evasive _ almost
Clintonesque _ in her response to speculation about steriods.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really know what to say about that,'' said Bolden.
``Athletes are determined individuals. Anything other than that is
something I don't want to comment on.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch. If Bolden was convinced FloJo was 100 percent clean, it
would be easy to spike the speculation. Instead, she wavered,
making us wonder whether she fears what might come out. Bolden,
after all, is a championship track coach at a major university.
Good friend or no, she has to be able to answer to her young
athletes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florence was a very dedicated person,'' remembered Bolden.
``She's still a world record-holder and that's what athletes aspire
for. And, of course, her flair for fashion was always there. I
remember in high school, I saw her team and they were all in white
tights. They were the only team dressed like that and it was her
idea. It was the same when we lived and trained together. Before a
meet, everyone would be nervous, but Florence would be painting her
fingernails.''
</P>
<P>
   While she spoke on this gray Monday in Los Angeles, the UCLA
track was sprinkled with dozens of college athletes _ all of them
young women.

5 AIRLINES IN MARKETING PACT TO RIVAL STAR ALLIANCE
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Lower case for `oneworld' cq.) 
(nk) 
 By ALAN COWELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Frustrated by regulatory delays as the airline industry
forms global alliances, British Airways PLC, American Airlines and
three other carriers announced a new marketing linkup Monday that
is intended to challenge the Star Alliance, spearheaded by Deutsche
Lufthansa AG and the UAL Corporation's United Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The new alliance _ called oneworld _ will not require regulatory
approval, the airlines say. It will link British Airways and
American Airlines, which is owned by the AMR Corp., with the
Canadian Airlines Corp., Qantas Airways Ltd. of Australia and
Cathay Pacific Airways of Hong Kong providing the group a long-term
reach into Asia despite that region's economic free-fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly it's not a fantastic time for the region at the
moment, but long term it's positive,'' said Andrew Light, an
airlines analyst at Salomon Smith Barney here.
</P>
<P>
   AMR already owns one-third of Canadian Airlines, and British
Airways has a stake of roughly 25 percent in Qantas.
</P>
<P>
   Along with franchise and partner airlines, the five carriers
will serve a total of 632 destinations in 138 countries. Last year
they carried 174 million passengers among them and employed 220,000
people. They will operate a total of 1,524 aircraft, according to
British Airways, which added that the arrangement would not mean
job losses for its staff of 60,500.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership rivals the slightly larger Star Alliance, which,
along with Lufthansa and United, embraces Thai Airways
International, Varig Brazilian Airlines SA, Air Canada and
Scandinavian Airlines System. Air New Zealand plans to join that
alliance next year.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Ayling, the British Airways chief executive, said at a
news conference that the new grouping was not a substitute for
British Airways' more far-reaching alliance with American Airlines,
which has been awaiting regulatory approval for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The new tie-in does not involve equity swaps and, unlike the
Star Alliance, will not initially offer code-sharing _ the system
by which one airline sells seats on allied airlines' flights, thus
drawing revenue from one another and facilitating the transfer of
passengers among them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a marketing agreement,'' said David Turnbull, chief
executive of Cathay Pacific, Asia's second-largest airline.
``Code-sharing requires regulatory approval. We want to work
together for a while first.''
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts, however, questioned the effectiveness of the
alliance without code-sharing.
</P>
<P>
   The agreement nonetheless reflects the trend among airlines to
widen their reach through alliances that do not require investment
and that are expected to create a handful of huge, global
partnerships.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union's competition watchdogs raised no immediate
objections to the new alliance but did not exclude intervention
later if they found its operations to be hostile to competition _
as some of its critics already contend.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Branson, chairman of the Virgin Group of Britain, which
owns Virgin Airlines, criticized the new agreement because of its
dominance on routes to Australia and Hong Kong and suggested that
Virgin might also seek alliances.
</P>
<P>
   ``From the consumer's point of view, it can't be good news,''
Branson told a television interviewer. ``Instead of oneworld you
could say: one company.''
</P>
<P>
   For investors, the announcement brought little if any relief:
British Airways shares, which are well down from a high closing
price of 703 pence on July 7 and have persistently underperformed
London's FTSE index, lost 25 pence Monday to close at 386 pence.
Cathay Pacific shares rose by 30 cents, to $6.75 (Hong Kong).
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   According to the participants, the tie-in will link the five
carriers' frequent-flier programs and enable them to reduce costs
through shared baggage-handling and other ground services, along
with linked reservation and flight-scheduling systems. Other
airlines thought likely to join the alliance include Iberia Lineas
Aereas SA of Spain, Finnair of Finland and Hong Kong Dragon
Airlines. The Japan Airlines Company rejected membership,
participants said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting next year, the participants said, the tie-in will offer
passengers smoother transfers among flights on the five carriers.
It will also strengthen networks in Asia, where airlines are
looking for strong growth after the current crisis.
</P>
<P>
   As a brand name, oneworld will supplement, but not replace, the
five carriers' existing logos. ``These are airlines with incredibly
strong brands and brands that work well in the marketplace,'' said
Donald Carty, the chairman of American Airlines. ``We're not going
to damage these brands.''
</P>
<P>
   None of the participants put a figure to their expectations of
increased profit.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Star Alliance, which includes Varig, the oneworld
lineup does not include a South American carrier. It is apparently
relying on American Airlines' routes to penetrate the region.
</P>
<P>
   While oneworld is separate from the British Airways-American
Airlines alliance, some analysts said the continuing regulatory
challenges to that arrangement could hamper the new linkup.
</P>
<P>
   Britain's Office of Fair Trading has urged that the two airlines
should be allowed to sell off, rather than surrender, 267 weekly
landing and takeoff slots in return for approval of their alliance.
But the European Commission maintains that such sales would be
unlawful.

   Feb. 2, 1998: SEEKING PRESIDENT'S TESTIMONY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   From Robert J. Bittman, deputy counsel to Starr, to Kendall:
</P>
<P>
   Dear David:
</P>
<P>
   As you know, President Clinton has publicly pledged to cooperate
fully with the investigation involving Monica Lewinsky. Last
Wednesday, January 28, I invited President Clinton, on behalf or
the grand jury, to testify before the grand jury this Thursday,
February 5, concerning matters relating to Ms. Lewinsky. You
indicated in our conversation that you would get back to me as to
whether the President will so testify. The grand jury awaits the
President's decision; please advise me as soon as possible what the
President decides.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Robert J. Bittman
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 4: STILL WAITING FOR TESTIMONY
</P>
<P>
   From Bittman to Kendall on Feb. 4:
</P>
<P>
   Dear David:
</P>
<P>
   Although the President has declined the invitation to testify
before the grand jury tomorrow, the grand jury's investigation
continues apace. On behalf of the grand jury and in an effort to
accommodate the President's schedule, we respectfully invite the
President to testify before the grand jury next Tuesday, Wednesday
or Thursday, February 10 to 12.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Feb. 5: ON PRESS LEAKS &UR;  &LR;  From Charles F.C. Ruff, lawyer to the
president, to Starr, regarding leaks to the press and executive
privilege:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Mr. Starr,
</P>
<P>
   This is in response to your letter of February 4, 1998.
</P>
<P>
   First, I want to inform you that within 45 minutes of its
delivery, James Bennet of The New York Times called the White House
Press Office to ask whether I had received a letter from you
concerning executive privilege. Since there could have been only a
few persons on your staff who were aware of the letter's delivery,
I ask that you immediately request that the FBI, using agents not
affiliated with your office, investigate to determine who disclosed
the existence of the letter and its substance (as well as,
presumably, the fact and substance of our &UR;  &LR; meeting) to the press. I
and the three members of my staff who were aware of the letter
before Bennet's call will be happy to be interviewed (under oath)
in connection with any such investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Let me move now to the substance of your letter.
</P>
<P>
   As you will not be surprised to learn, I disagree with your
position on the applicability of executive privilege to discussions
among senior White House staff and between senior staff and the
President concerning the Lewinsky matter. ...
</P>
<P>
   Let me also clarify three points I made in our meeting. First,
discussions among and between the President's senior staff involve
the very capacity of the President and his staff to govern _ to
pursue his legislative agenda, to ensure the continued leadership
of the United States in the world community, and to maintain the
confidence and support of the people who elected him _ all of which
lie at the heart of his role under Article II of the Constitution.
Second, as to what position the President himself might take on the
assertion of executive privilege as to his communications if he
were to be questioned, I did not purport to take any position _
``firm'' or otherwise. And third, I indicated that, in deciding
whether to assert privilege, we have historically sought to
distinguish the substance of advisory and deliberative discussions
from segregable facts, not available elsewhere, that may be
contained in otherwise privileged communications.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, I remain willing to explore all avenues for resolving
our disagreement, although I admit to being more than a little
uncertain as to how to conduct discussions without reading about
them simultaneously in the press.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   Charles F.C. Ruff
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 9: THE WAITING CONTINUES
</P>
<P>
   From Bittman to Kendall:
</P>
<P>
   Dear David:
</P>
<P>
   Last Wednesday, we, on behalf of the grand jury, extended a
second invitation to the President to testify before the grand jury
about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky. You did not respond to
the invitation by last Friday, as requested in my letter. The grand
jury's work continues. Nothwithstanding your failure to respond,
the grand jury would be pleased to accommodate the President's
testimony any day or time this week.
</P>
<P>
   Let me make our request specific and clear: the grand jury
deserves to know whether the President will respond, favorably, to
the invitation. Such an invitation is, of course, fully consistent
with our profound respect for the Presidency in our system of
separated powers. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely
</P>
<P>

NETWORKS DECIDE CLINTON VIDEO GOOD TELEVISION, AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhat to their surprise, the broadcast networks joined their
cable brethren Monday in televising President Clinton's grand jury
testimony, rather than simply airing excerpts as they had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason: a transcript of Clinton's videotaped testimony
that was delivered to the networks just a few minutes before they
began broadcasting it. Armed with the transcript, the networks were
able to ascertain in advance that the testimony was not as sexually
explicit as they feared.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the networks simply found that the four hours of
presidential testimony about Clinton's relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky made for good television. (Not everyone agreed: Boston
television stations were deluged with hundreds of calls from
viewers complaining that their favorite soap operas had been
preempted).
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that only NBC broke away from the testimony,
declining to broadcast two segments where prosecutors asked Clinton
about particular sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a holiday, with a lot of families together and a lot of
young children potentially watching, we just decided to err on the
side of conservatism,'' said Beth O'Connell, executive producer of
special events for NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC broke away, WHDH-Channel 7, the Boston NBC affiliate,
immediately switched to CNN's coverage. ``We wanted to make sure
our viewers could have the choice to decide if they wanted to turn
down the sound,'' said Channel 7 news director Mark Berryhill. ``We
just wanted the best coverage, whether that comes from NBC or
CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the segments of four and six minutes, respectively,
NBC aired the rest of Clinton's testimony. ABC and CBS broadcast it
in its entirety, along with the cable networks CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
Channel, and C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   For the broadcast networks, it was a day of scrambling to keep
ahead of the videotape. Even as the testimony was broadcast to a
national audience, network personnel raced through hundreds of
pages of transcript. At NBC, O'Connell said, a news division vice
president, numerous correspondents and producers, and even the
network ombudsman were enlisted in the network's ``very elaborate
system'' for reading the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which had planned last week to air only the first five
minutes of Clinton's testimony before cutting away and then airing
excerpts, ended up broadcasting the entire testimony unedited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it started, it was simply more compelling than we thought
it was going to be,'' acknowledged ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy.
``And there was really less explicit and graphic material than we
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although ABC employed a 5-second delay so it could edit
out anything the network deemed offensive, no editing occurred. The
network did air an onscreen advisory warning of ``graphic sexual
content.''
</P>
<P>
   The availability of a transcript made the decision easier at
CBS, which last week said it would make no decision on airing the
testimony until network executives got a look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the feed of the tape started coming in, we had a
transcript, so we were able to look ahead and get a sense of what
was in the tape,'' said CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony videotape was broken up into seven parts; CBS
aired the first three parts live, the next three with a 10-second
delay and an advisory warning of ``strong language and sexual
content,'' and the last part live.

 UNDATED: J. Bittman  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Feb. 13: INVITATION DECLINED
</P>
<P>
   From Kendall to Bittman:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Bob:
</P>
<P>
   This will respond to your letters dated February 4 and 9, 1998.
I was unable to respond to your February 4 invitation by the Friday
deadline you had indicated in your letter because I was in the
process of dealing with prejudicial and false leaks of information
about your investigation. ... These leaks are highly unfair and
prejudicial to the President and others, and, as you may know, on
Monday I filed a sealed motion with the Chief Judge seeking
judicial remedies in an effort to enforce the secrecy and
confidentiality of the investigative process.
</P>
<P>
   I acknowledge your invitation for the President to appear before
the grand jury next week. The President has the greatest respect
for the grand jury. However, under the circumstances, it is
impossible to accept this invitation. The situation in Iraq
continues to be dangerously volatile, and this has demanded much of
the President's time and attention. The President also has a heavy
travel schedule at present. Our access to him has necessarily been
limited. Moreover, as I informed you during our February 3
telephone conversation concerning this matter, we have simply had
inadequate opportunity to prepare so that we may give our client
the informed advice of counsel which he, like every other citizen,
deserves. Your recent letter references your office's ``profound
respect for the Presidency in our system of separated powers.''
However, I am certain that you understand why, in light of the
well-publicized and questionable investigative techniques of your
office, we feel we would be derelict in our professional duty to a
client unless we assured ourselves that we had adequate opportunity
to advise that client appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   In the event you decide to ``inform the grand jury of this turn
of events'', as stated in your letter, I would respectfully request
that you also read my letter to the grand jury and make my letter
part of the grand jury record.
</P>
<P>
   I thank you for your courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kendall
</P>
<P>
   Feb. 17: ON POSSIBLE JONES CONTACTS
</P>
<P>
   From Kendall to Starr on Feb. 17, complaining of improper
contacts lawyers for Paula Jones:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Judge Starr:
</P>
<P>
   I write with an inquiry in the wake of a Chicago Tribune article
which appeared on February 11 (copy enclosed), and I am making this
request in an effort to obtain accurate information so that I may
decide how to proceed. The article reports that one of your
partners in Kirkland &AMP; Ellis, Mr. Richard Porter, may have provided
legal advice and services to plaintiff Paula Corbin Jones in her
civil suit against President Clinton. The article also reports that
someone at the law firm FAXed a copy of a draft affidavit in the
Jones case to the Tribune prior to the affidavit's filing in court,
an action which would, if true suggest that the firm has indeed
been involved in the legal prosecution of the Jones case. Finally,
the article reports that one of the Jones lawyers Joseph Camarata
received advice from Mr. Porter on several occasions about legal
issues in the Jones case. ...
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, there have been reports of your own participation
in legal discussions with Ms. Jones' lawyers, prior to the time you
were appointed Independent Counsel.
</P>
<P>
   I hope you can therefore perceive why I am requesting accurate
and specific information (i) concerning your own, Mr. Porter's and
any other Kirkland &AMP; Ellis lawyer's, employees or agent's contacts
with and assistance to Ms. Paula Corbin Jones and/or her attorneys
or agents or supporting groups, and (ii) concerning what was
conveyed to the Attorney General and the Special Division in
January, 1998 about any such contacts and assistance, when you
sought an expansion of your jurisdiction to encompass the Jones v.
Clinton case.
</P>
<P>
   I thank you for your courtesy.
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   David T. Kendall
</P>
<P>
   March 4: TOO BUSY TO TESTIFY
</P>
<P>
   From Kendall to Bittman, responding to a further request that
the president appear before the grand jury:
</P>
<P>
   Dear Bob:
</P>
<P>
   This will respond to your letters dated February 21 and March 2,
1998. I apologize for my delay in responding. The fault is mine: as
you know, we filed a lengthy reply on Friday in the sealed
``leaks'' matter, responding to your opposition to our original
motion for contempt sanctions. That matter simply absorbed my time,
but I am now able to give your correspondence the attention it
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   As I hope you are aware, the President has the greatest respect
for the grand jury. I appreciate your own acknowledgement in your
March 2 letter of the ``grave duties of state'' which are uniquely
the President's and the ``immense and weighty responsibilities'' he
must discharge. The buck really does stop with the President for
decision-making on a vast range of issues that are critical to this
country's safety and economic security.
</P>
<P>
   While it is true that not every moment of the day is absorbed by
the duties of office, the President is extraordinarily busy on a
range of important public issues, some of which are visible and
some of which are not. In our judgment, our ability to have access
to the President is simply insufficient at the present time for
purposes of representing him adequately in the matters with which
you are concerned.
</P>
<P>
   Accordingly, he will, on our advice, not be able to accept your
invitation for him to testify at this time. I am certain you would
agree that the President deserves the same right to the informed
assistance of private counsel as does every other citizen.
</P>
<P>
   Your most recent letter remarks that the situation in Iraq has
``thankfully, eased.'' While there are some respects in which this
may be true, the situation remains highly volatile, as a glance at
today's newspapers will reveal. The continuing Southeast Asian
economic crisis and the Bosnian situation also demand a great deal
of the President's time, as do other national security issues, many
of which are highly confidential.
</P>
<P>
   On the domestic front, the President's schedule is equally
congested. The Administration's proposed budget was submitted to
Congress last month, and the President is in the midst of major
negotiations with the Republican majorities over key budgetary
objectives, such as reserving the bulk of the budgetary surplus for
Social Security. Other Administration initiatives are at critical
stages. The President is attempting to hammer out national
legislation around a tobacco liability settlement. More ``town
hall'' meetings are scheduled concerning the president's race
initiative, which will focus on the need for strengthening the
Equal Employment Opportunities Commission and the Civil Rights
Division of the Justice Department. There is also currently in the
White House a sustained focus on major health care proposals
(expanding Medicare coverage to persons age 55-64 who have lost
their health coverage due to no fault of their own; securing
passage of an HMO patient ``bill of rights''), on new education
legislation (enacting strong national educational standards; trying
to improve math and science achievement), and on highway
legislation/auto safety bills (federal standards for a lower blood
alcohol definition in DUI cases).
</P>
<P>
   The President also has an extremely heavy foreign and domestic
travel schedule. He will be out of the country for nearly three
weeks this month and next in Africa and South America. ...
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, as I indicated in my earlier letter, we remain
concerned about some of the well-publicized and questionable
investigative techniques used by your office. Events of recent days
have done nothing to alleviate this concern, and this necessarily
affects our judgment as to the degree of preparation necessary to
assure the President has adequate and informed legal assistance at
the present time. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   David E. Kendall

COMMENTARY: TO THE STAKE! 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By ANTHONY LEWIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Which of us could bear to be questioned relentlessly by
hostile prosecutors about our sexual practices, our sins? That is
what I thought as I watched the videotape of President Clinton's
grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   It was a tape that should never have been shown, one that
degraded this country _ and not only because of the sexual details
on which the prosecutors dwelt. Showing it shattered the norms of
privacy that any decent society respects. It legitimized the
would-be moral police who want to pry into all of our bedrooms.
</P>
<P>
   The great Czech writer Milan Kundera, at a time when his country
lived under communism, warned of the cost of revealing ``intimate
life. The police destroy it in communist countries, journalists
threaten it in democratic countries, and little by little the
people themselves lose their taste for private life and their sense
of it. Life when one can't hide from the eyes of others _ that is
hell. ... Without secrecy, nothing is possible _ not love, not
friendship.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course Clinton committed the wrongs that started it all, as
he himself told the prosecutors when he said he would not go into
``intensely painful'' details. ``This has been tough enough already
on me and my family,'' he said, ``although I take responsibility
for it _ I have no one to blame but myself.''
</P>
<P>
   But his wrongdoing cannot justify the illegitimate process that
has come to a hysterical climax in Washington this week: a
prosecutor breaking the rules to destroy the president, a
television corps acting as the prosecutor's chorus, partisan
Republicans in Congress making a mockery of the notion that
conservatives respect institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr has done things to Clinton that no ordinary
citizen would have to suffer. No other target of a grand jury
investigation would have his testimony _ one of the most protected
secrets of our legal system _ broadcast. Indeed, no other targets
would have appeared before the grand jury at all, because Justice
Department rules tell federal prosecutors not to call them.
</P>
<P>
   Starr had deliberately humiliated the first lady by calling her
before the grand jury and making her walk through the press mob at
the courthouse. To avoid that, the president asked to be questioned
at the White House. Starr agreed _ subject to the condition that
the event be taped. He then gave the tape to the House Judiciary
Committee, whose Republican majority did as he expected and
released it.
</P>
<P>
   Starr's bullies intimidated Monica Lewinsky when they first
confronted her, keeping her from calling her lawyer for 10 hours.
His office was brazen in its illicit leaking.
</P>
<P>
   As for Congress, it is instructive to compare the performance of
the Judiciary Committee these last days with what happened in
Watergate. Then, Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski sent the
committee a briefcase of evidence with no comment, no strident call
for impeachment; the contents did not leak and have not leaked to
this day. The committee met in private for a long time before
holding public hearings. It was deliberate, respectful of process _
and significantly bipartisan.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest difference now is in the press, especially
television. Today, when you turn on the Sunday television ``news''
programs, you might be watching Starr's prosecutors rehearsing.
They sound like a crowd at an auto-da-fe, a burning at the stake in
the Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
   My colleague Russell Baker has suggested that the TV people,
having long ago predicted Clinton's demise, are furious at the
public for not agreeing, and so turn up the heat. Another reason is
money. The networks think the way to compete with cable is to play
up this irresistible sex story.
</P>
<P>
   I doubt that Clinton was hurt by the broadcast of the videotape.
He looked forlorn; he kept his temper more than most of us would.
But we were hurt. The videotape was one more step in a process that
is profoundly anti-constitutional. And it further damaged this
country's standing in the world.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, I do not believe that the Senate will hold a trial
of the president, bringing Monica Lewinsky in as a witness and
questioning her in the well of the Senate. Sex and lying about it
are not grounds for impeachment. Instead our system is being
dirtied by prosecutorial excess and the politics of leering.

TAPED CLINTON SHOWN FIGHTING FOR POLITICAL SURVIVAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN MCGRORY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ President Clinton, in a videotape destined to
provide an enduring image for history, described Monica Lewinsky as
a ``good young woman with a good mind and a good heart,'' even
while repeatedly lashing out at his political opponents for trying
to ``take a wrecking ball'' to his presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give anything in the world not to be here talking about
it,'' Clinton somberly said of his affair with Lewinsky, in the
videotape of his federal grand jury testimony released Monday.
``I'd give anything in the world not to be admitting what I've had
to admit today.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a stunning spectacle: The president of the United States,
his cheeks flared pink and his forehead glistening, seeking legal
meaning in word tenses, evading grand jurors' questions, and
dancing around his own awkward definition of sexual relations _ one
based on a definition given him by Paula Jones's lawyers, which did
not include oral sex.
</P>
<P>
   He appeared at turns amiable and angry, confident and concerned,
but at no point, predictions to the contrary, did he lose his famed
temper on camera. He sipped Diet Coke, Canada Dry ginger ale, and a
tumbler filled with ice water, and much of the four hours and three
minutes of videotape was interesting to watch, but produced few
surprises.
</P>
<P>
   From this testimony and the seven months of investigation that
led to it, Independent Counsel Kenneth W. Starr sent a detailed
report to Congress on Sept. 9 outlining 11 possible grounds for
Clinton's impeachment. Among the allegations were a series of
perjury counts, including one accusation that Clinton lied about
the nature and extent of his sexual relationship with Lewinsky
before the federal grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The footage of Clinton's testimony, taken on Aug. 17 in the
White House Map Room and beamed to the grand jury room across town,
was fed directly to an international audience Monday morning by at
least four cable television networks that broadcast it in its
entirety. It was part of a massive public release of information
from the House Judiciary Committee, including Lewinsky's own
sexually explicit testimony to the grand jury in August.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid, uncensored release of the tape and the accompanying
transcripts marked a significant risk by Republican leaders on
Capitol Hill, who faced the possibility of angering an uncertain
public increasingly wary of the criticism of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic allies and White House aides immediately said the
airing of Clinton's testimony might boost his public standing,
because it shows a relatively composed president persevering
despite an onslaught of invasive and sexually explicit questions
from prosecutors bent on cornering and embarrassing him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people don't like to see a president go through this, but
at the same time I don't think most people learned anything new
about this matter,'' said Michael McCurry, the White House press
secretary.
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans agreed that little new was learned from the
videotape, given the numerous leaks and the prior publication of
the Starr report, and, in the words of one, no ``knockout blow''
was delivered. Still, others said Clinton's sometimes artless
interpretation of the definition of sexual relations and his
curious reliance on word tenses and meanings would show him to be
the conniver that critics have called him.
</P>
<P>
   ``After viewing this videotape, no reasonable person could
conclude that the president did not knowingly lie to the grand jury
and to the court,'' said Representative Bob Barr a Georgia
Republican and a member of the House Judiciary Committee. Barr has
long sought Clinton's impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa voiced a concern that many
others on Capitol Hill have kept private: That Clinton is afflicted
with some more consequential disorder than irresponsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm coming around to the belief that there's something deeper
here, that the president maybe has something wrong with him in
terms of how he approaches this,'' Harkin said in an interview with
a Des Moines television station. ``I don't know whether it's an
illness or something like that, but I don't know how else to
explain what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton began his testimony by pulling a folded sheet of paper
out of his jacket pocket, putting on a pair of reading glasses, and
reading a statement to prosecutors and grand jury members
acknowledging for the first time his relationship with Lewinsky,
despite seven months of adamant denials that preceded his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I engaged in conduct that was wrong,'' he said. ``These
encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse. They did not
constitute sexual relations, as I understood that term to be
defined at my Jan. 17, 1998 deposition'' in the Jones lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they did involve inappropriate, intimate contact,''
Clinton said, reading from his notes. ``These inappropriate
encounters ended at my insistence in early 1997. I also had
occasional telephone conversations with Ms. Lewinsky that included
inappropriate sexual banter. I regret that what began as a
friendship came to include this conduct. And I take full
responsibility for my actions.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again, he refused to elaborate on the extent of his
sexual contact with Lewinsky, though he implied that he received
oral sex from the young woman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not trying to be evasive here,'' Clinton said. ``I'm
trying to protect my privacy, my family's privacy.'' At another
point Clinton added that he was trying ``to preserve the dignity of
the office I hold.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, in an assertion that likely led to one of Starr's perjury
allegations, Clinton contradicted Lewinsky's testimony that he
repeatedly fondled her breasts and other parts of her body, in
effect denying any sexual touching.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not my recollection,'' Clinton said. ``My recollection
is that I did not have sexual relations with Ms. Lewinsky. And I'm
staying on my former statement about that.''
</P>
<P>
   At another time, asked how he could fail to believe that oral
sex does not fall within the definition of sexual relations,
Clinton pointed to the definition of sexual relations used when he
was deposed on January 17 in the Jones suit and maintained that,
under its terms, a person receiving oral sex is not involved in
sexual relations. In the Jones case, sexual relations was defined
as the touching of the breasts, buttocks, and genitalia for the
purposes of arousing or gratifying a partner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because if the deponent is the person who has oral sex
performed on him, then the contact is not with anything on that
list, but with the lips of another person,'' Clinton said. ``It
seems to be self-evident that that's what it is. Let me remind you,
sir, I read this carefully. And I thought about it. I thought about
what `contact' meant. I thought about what `intent to arouse or
gratify' meant.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed to become angriest when he repeatedly diverted
the topic to Jones and her team of financial supporters who have
pursued her sexual harassment case for several years. The case was
dismissed by a federal judge on April 1, in a decision that is now
under appeal.
</P>
<P>
   It was in the Jones case that Clinton was first asked about his
relationship with Lewinsky. At the time, he denied having sexual
contact with her and said he could not recall ever being alone with
her at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal in this deposition was to be truthful, but not
particularly helpful,'' Clinton said in the grand jury appearance.
``I did not wish to do the work of the Jones lawyers. I deplored
what they were doing. I deplored the innocent people they were
tormenting and traumatizing. I deplored their illegal leaking. I
deplored the fact that once they knew our evidence, that this was a
bogus lawsuit, and that becuse of the funding they had from my
political enemies, they were pushing ahead. I deplored it. but I
was determined to walk through the minefield of this deposition
without violating the law. And I believe I did.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points throughout the appearance, Clinton essentially
acknowledged that he realized his affair would eventually become
public, displaying a penchant for risk that has both baffled and
infuriated his closest allies in the White House. The affair was
conducted during his 1996 reelection campaign and could have
potentially crippled his efforts if discovered.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that the minute there was no longer any contact, she
would talk about this,'' Clinton said, somewhat matter of factly.
``She would have to. She couldn't help it. It was, it was a part of
her psyche. So, I had put myself at risk, sir. I was not trying to
buy her silence or get Vernon Jordan to buy her silence. I thought
she was a good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton spoke of Lewinsky only in flattering terms. He seemed
contemptuous when he spoke of former Lewinsky colleague Linda Tripp
as having ``stabbed her in the back'' by secretly recording
conversations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, Clinton and his personal attorney, David Kendall,
seemed to foreshadow the events that were to come, hinting that
they expected the videotape would someday be released, even though
grand jury testimony is secret by law.

FEDS ARREST WOULD-BE SUCCESSOR TO MISSING MOBSTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SHELLEY MURPHY AND PATRICIA NEALON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A reputed gangster who allegedly muscled his way into
the South Boston drug business in the absence of fugitive crime
boss James J. ``Whitey'' Bulger was nabbed Monday in a cocaine
sting.
</P>
<P>
   Philip J. Myers, 44, a convicted bank robber and killer, and
reputed leader of a violent white supremacist group rooted in
federal prisons, faces drug charges that could send him to prison
for 10 years to life.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has taken a foothold in Southie,'' said a source familiar
with the investigation. ``He's moved right in. Even the bad guys
want him off the street.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Myers' arrest, a federal indictment was unsealed
charging his brother, Paul Myers, and Stephen A. ``Buttsy'' Carr,
both 43 and of Boston's Charlestown section, with conspiring to
distribute cocaine and related charges. They appeared in federal
court and were ordered held pending a detention hearing Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Myers brothers are members of Teamsters Local 25 and work at
the loading dock at the Boston Herald. Paul Myers was arrested
shortly before noon Monday near the newspaper's loading dock.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests followed an investigation by the federal Drug
Enforcement Administration, &UR;  &LR; the US Housing and Urban Development's
Inspector General's office, the Department of Corrections,
Somerville, Everett and Cambridge Police.
</P>
<P>
   The Myers brothers allegedly operated their drug business out of
the Mishawam &UR;  &LR; housing development in Charlestown.
</P>
<P>
   Last May, an unidentified witness who was cooperating with the
DEA met with Philip Myers _ a meeting recorded on video and audio
tape _ and told Myers that he knew of a drug trafficker who
regularly stored packages of cocaine in his car, according to an
affidavit filed by DEA Special Agent Joseph W. Desmond.
</P>
<P>
   The witness told Myers that his brother, Paul, had mentioned
that Myers might be interested in stealing one of the shipments.
Philip Myers signed on.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, DEA agents parked a maroon Mercedes in the parking lot
of the Best Western Hotel in Cambridge and placed a package large
enough to hold six kilograms of cocaine inside.
</P>
<P>
   After taking the package, Philip Myers was arrested on a
complaint charging him with attempting to possess cocaine with
intent to distribute.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Myers, a tall, lanky man with brown hair and a droopy
mustache, shuffled into federal court in shackles, wearing a baggy
blue jersey and black shorts.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant US Attorney George W. Vien said the government wants
Myers jailed without bail pending trial on the grounds that he
would pose a danger if released and might flee the area.
</P>
<P>
   US Magistrate Judge Robert B. Collings, who scheduled a
detention hearing for Thursday, told Myers that they had met 23
years ago when Collings _ then an assistant US attorney _ had
prosecuted Myers for bank robbery. He volunteered to recuse himself
from the case, but Myers' attorney, Frederick Ford, said that would
not be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He felt 23 years ago you were fair and would be so today,''
Ford said, quoting Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Myers was a promising young hockey player when he was
arrested by Boston Police in July 1974 for possession of a
sawed-off shotgun. Two months later he was charged with bank
robbery, and later convicted and sentenced to 13 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   In 1978, Myers was paroled. But a month later, he was charged
with trying to kill a Boston Police officer after threatening to
blow his head off. The parole violation was enough to send Myers
back to federal prison to finish his bank robbery sentence.
</P>
<P>
   While in a federal penitentiary in Memphis, Myers killed an
inmate on Feb. 9, 1982 over a cocaine debt. The victim, Steven
Horvath, had bought cocaine from Myers in prison, but failed to pay
him, according to federal court records.
</P>
<P>
   Myers was convicted by a jury of voluntary manslaughter and
sentenced to an additional eight years in prison. He was sent to
the federal penitentiary in Marion, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal appeals court decision denying Myers' request for
appeal, the court wrote that Myers struck Horvath in the head and
neck with a sharpened steel rod and ``one of the blows from the rod
or `shank' went into Horvath's skull, through his brain and into
his brain stem.''
</P>
<P>
   While in federal prison, according to sources, Myers was
recruited by the Aryan Brotherhood and eventually became a leader
in the white supremacist group that boasts about 2,000 members
nationally.
</P>
<P>
   Killing is an integral part of gang membership, according to a
federal inmate who prepared a detailed report on the Aryan
Brotherhood for the government during the 1981 trial of a leader of
the gang.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Myers was released from federal prison in June 1993, then
served the rest of his state sentence in Cedar Junction in Walpole.
He became a free man in May 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Within the past year, Philip Myers teamed up with a crew from
South Boston that had been challenging a crew loyal to Bulger for
control of the area, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
   It was Myers' brazenness and his reputation for violence that
made him a prime target of law enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had enormous influence,'' said a source familiar with the
investigation. ``He was using intimidation and threats. You drive a
rod through somebody's brain and word gets around pretty quick.''

TEXAN CHARGED WITH BIN LADEN LINK
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BENJAMIN WEISER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Texan was indicted Monday on new charges that he lied about
his knowledge of the activities of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi exile
suspected in the bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania last month.
</P>
<P>
   In bringing the new charges against Wadih el Hage, who has
admitted that he worked as bin Laden's personal secretary in Sudan
in 1994, federal prosecutors in Manhattan offered their most
expansive look yet at the scope and direction of their
investigation into bin Laden and his organization, Al Qaeda.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation described in the indictment appears to be
moving on dual tracks. One aspect is bin Laden's role in the
embassy bombing in Nairobi. The other is the larger look at his
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Judging from the questions posed to Hage in the grand jury,
which are quoted in the indictment, it also appears that
prosecutors see him as a potentially valuable witness in both the
bombing case and in the broader investigation. Hage was accused
Monday of eight counts of lying to a grand jury.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities said for the first time that the investigation
of the roles of bin Laden and Al Qaeda in international terrorism
dates to 1996. By the fall of 1997, they said, the inquiry had
expanded to include bin Laden's operations in about 20 countries,
including the United States and reaching across the Middle East and
into the former Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation is focusing in particular on the roles of Hage
and two other aides in providing logistical support and training to
people who attacked U.S. and U.N. forces in Somalia in 1993 and in
early 1994.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment, which sketches the organization's command
structure, suggests that federal investigators also suspect that
Hage traveled to other countries to procure chemical weapons and
their components on behalf of bin Laden.
</P>
<P>
   Hage, of Arlington, Texas, said nothing Monday in a brief
hearing in federal district court in Manhattan, where a federal
magistrate, Judge Henry Pitman, agreed to hold him without bond
until a bail proceeding on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   His lawyer, Bruce McIntyre, said after the hearing that he had
no comment about the new charges. Hage was charged last week with
three counts of lying to investigators when he was questioned about
bin Laden's activities.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   During the hearing, McIntyre complained that Hage, who is being
held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, had not been
permitted to use a telephone in the week since he was arrested.
``He has a family,'' McIntyre told Pitman. ``He has not been able
to contact them.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Fitzgerald told Pitman that he
would contact prison officials and try to get Hage access to a
phone.
</P>
<P>
   It was not possible to discern from Monday's indictment how much
progress investigators have made toward solving the embassy
bombings or tying bin Laden directly to the attacks.
</P>
<P>
   But one expert, Kenneth Katzman, a specialist in Middle Eastern
affairs and terrorism at the Library of Congress, said that the
indictment suggests that the federal grand jury investigation began
earlier than had been widely known, and shows for the first time
that the grand jury has been examining bin Laden's attempts to
acquire chemical arms.
</P>
<P>
   The document also suggests that Hage, who has been working in an
auto mechanic's shop in Fort Worth, Texas, was in the upper echelon
of bin Laden's organization.
</P>
<P>
   The document asserts that when bin Laden's former military
commander, Abu Ubaidah al-Banshiri, died in a ferry accident in
Lake Victoria in 1996, Hage traveled to Lake Victoria to find out
what had happened to him. The indictment charges that Hage lied to
the grand jury when he denied making that trip to Lake Victoria and
denied knowing that Banshiri had drowned.
</P>
<P>
   The indictment also identifies another man, Abu Hafs al-Masry,
as bin Laden's ``current military commander.'' His whereabouts are
unknown.

CONDIT TESTIFIES IN BOEING DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing Chairman Phil Condit was the witness the TV
cameras were waiting for at the federal courthouse in Seattle
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   But inside the courtroom, Condit was upstaged by the company's
former director of Equal Opportunity, Viola Keith, who accused
Boeing's lawyers of trying to slant her testimony in the racial
discrimination lawsuit brought by Jesse Jones against the aerospace
giant.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing's lawyers immediately denied it.
</P>
<P>
   Although it seemed like a bombshell at the time, Judge Edward
Rafeedie said Keith's allegations would essentially require a new
trial; he ruled at the end of the day that they would not be
admissible.
</P>
<P>
   Jesse Jones, a former manager in security investigations for
Boeing, sued the company alleging the company discriminated against
him by denying him raises and promotions and retaliating against
him after he complained about it.
</P>
<P>
   Though Keith is still receiving $89,000 per year from Boeing,
she said she had been relieved of her duties after her deposition
did not support the company's position in the case, and is now ``on
loan'' to the Urban League. She was called as a witness friendly to
Jones.
</P>
<P>
   Dressed in a black suit and white blouse, Keith testified
calmly, waiting while Boeing attorney Lawrence Hannah and Jones
attorney John Sheridan sparred repeatedly over what Sheridan could
ask. Hannah wanted to limit Keith's testimony only to things she
had seen and heard, and Sheridan wanted her opinions, feelings,
professional knowledge and anything else helpful. At one point,
Keith cried out, ``I don't know what I can say and what I can't
say.''
</P>
<P>
   But she continued, and at noon, Judge Edward Rafeedie let the
jury leave for lunch. Keith stepped down.
</P>
<P>
   But the lawyers weren't quite finished. Sheridan said that one
of Keith's comments suggested that she had been ``pressured to
change her testimony.'' He wanted to know more.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing attorney Lawrence Hannah leapt to his feet, ``That's
nonsense and a flat-out lie, Your Honor,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sheridan suggested they ask Keith. She was standing right there.
</P>
<P>
   The judge put Keith back on the stand, out of the presence of
the jury and asked whether she had ever been pressured to change
her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt that during my deposition by Mr. Hannah and Ms. Clarke
that they would prefer that I not be forthcoming with the truth,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Rafeedie asked her to be more specific.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your honor, no one is going to come out and ask you to lie in
a court of law,'' Keith said. What the Boeing attorneys had said,
Keith asserted, was ``You don't have to say this,'' and ``You could
say this,'' and ``Maybe you could take a trip.''
</P>
<P>
   The judge snapped back, ``Who told you that?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miss Clarke,'' said Keith, referring to Boeing co-counsel Joan
Clarke of the Perkins Coie firm.
</P>
<P>
   Clarke spoke up. ``Your Honor, that's outrageous!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What else did she tell you?'' Rafeedie said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Was anyone present when she told you this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``No.'' Keith said she had heard it during preparation for her
deposition.
</P>
<P>
   The judge questioned Keith a second time. She told the same
story, adding that she had told John Curry in Boeing's legal
department about the inappropriate suggestions. She said the
company had known of all this.
</P>
<P>
   Rafeedie was angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``All witnesses are prepared for testimony,'' the judge said.
``Even President Clinton. But they are not prepared to lie.''
</P>
<P>
   Apart from the trial, Boeing seemed to realize the bombshell
nature of Keith's testimony and issued a brief comment to
reporters:
</P>
<P>
   ``Through an independent investigation into allegations brought
by Ms. Keith, including those shared in court today, it was
determined by the independent investigator that at no time did
outside counsel act improperly or pressure Ms. Keith into
testifying untruthfully.
</P>
<P>
   ``In fact, the independent investigator, in her report, states
Ms. Keith denied that she had ever been instructed not to be
truthful.''
</P>
<P>
   Boeing spokesman Peter Conte said the investigator is an African
American attorney who works at a Seattle firm other than Perkins
Coie or Davis Wright Tremaine.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the day, Boeing's chairman, Condit, dressed in a blue
suit, strode rapidly to the witness stand and began answering
Sheridan's questions.
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he had met with Jesse Jones in September 1996 for
about an hour. But he couldn't remember much about the meeting.
(Condit said later on the courthouse steps, ``That was a drop-in
visit. I have an open-door policy.'')
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he did not recall instructing the other Boeing
person at that meeting, Michael Stewart, vice-president for
employee relations, to ``fix it,'' as Jones has said in
depositions. The Boeing chief executive said, ``That would surprise
me. That would not be the way I would approach the problem. I just
don't say that.''
</P>
<P>
   Condit said he did not recall saying to Stewart after the
meeting that he did not want executive protection from a man as
emotional, unstable and intense as Jones, as is indicated by a
document from Stewart. ``I have no memory of that at all, and it
does not sound like anything I would say,'' Condit said.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Condit had apparently been e-mailed by Jones several times
later in 1996. Jones was complaining about Stewart's investigation
and asking Condit to step in. Those e-mails were not answered, and
were instead forwarded to Stewart. Condit said they had probably
been forwarded by a screener. ``Any e-mails that come to me, with
the exception of a very few people, get reviewed first. I have
someone who reads all of that and forwards it and responds for
me.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it your practice to forward complaints such as this without
reading them?'' Sheridan asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases _ in most cases, yes,'' Condit said. ``If I had
to look at every single piece of information that came in, that's
all I would do every day.''
</P>
<P>
   The one note of levity in Condit's testimony was when Sheridan
asked him about how big Boeing is, how many airplanes it is
building and how much money it makes. Wasn't it true, Sheridan
said, that the company has forecasted double digit profits?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Condit, in one of his few flat-out denials. ``I
would love that. But we aren't. There are almost no companies in
the world that make that kind of profits.''

ANALYSIS: ARE THE LIES IMPEACHABLE OFFENSES? 
</HEADLINE>
  (Correcting typo in 17th graf, quote by Rep. Zoe Lofgren) 
(JT) 
 By ALISON MITCHELL    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as the nation watched President Clinton on
videotape Monday, many members of Congress on both sides of the
aisle had already decided that he lied under oath. Now the
question, which Congress is already starting to debate, is whether
that is grounds for impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel, certainly
seemed to think so. In his report to Congress, he held that perjury
and obstruction of justice by any citizen ``are profoundly serious
matters'' and that ``when such acts are committed by the president
of the United States, we believe these acts `may constitute grounds
for an impeachment.'''
</P>
<P>
   But the Constitution's description of an impeachable offense as
treason, bribery and other ``high crimes and misdemeanors'' is
subject to continual reinterpretation.
</P>
<P>
   That constitutional ambiguity has sent Congress looking through
precedent, law, public opinion polls and Clinton's parsings to
decide whether his attempt to cover up his affair with Monica S.
Lewinsky should bring his removal from office.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said Monday: ``The president cannot
go before a grand jury and say things that are not true. What will
happen to the rule of law if he did that?''
</P>
<P>
   But he is only one member of the House Judiciary Committee,
which is in the vanguard of impeachment deliberations. And while
many members of the committee now say they are certain to recommend
that the House open an impeachment inquiry, the spectrum among its
36 members shows that the ultimate decision on whether to impeach
Clinton is not likely to be clear or easy.
</P>
<P>
   It may be the preponderant view in Congress that Clinton lied.
But is that perjury? Not every committee member agrees. Nor do all
members of the Judiciary Committee put the same weight on the
president's deposition in the sexual harassment case brought by
Paula Corbin Jones as on the four hours of grand jury testimony,
which was broadcast Monday. In fact, some members of Congress are
asking whether a perjury case based on Clinton's Jones deposition
is one that most prosecutors would bring to court.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., draws a distinction, for example,
between Clinton's testimony before the grand jury and his earlier
deposition in the Jones case. The Jones civil case was ultimately
dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's always bothered me,'' said Graham, a Judiciary
Committee member who was once an Air Force prosecutor. ``Would I as
a prosecutor spend time and money to prosecute a guy who lies in a
deposition in a case that was dismissed?
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is to set the standard that if the average citizen
engaged in like conduct they would have severe legal
consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill McCollum of Florida, one of Graham's Republican
colleagues, does not share his qualms about the Jones deposition.
``I have no doubt in my mind, based on other cases,'' McCollum
said, ``that it doesn't make any difference if the case was thrown
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet on the other side, Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., is not even
certain that a prosecutor would bring a perjury case against
Clinton based on the grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's, `he said, she said,''' Nadler said. He noted that Starr
had presumed that Ms. Lewinsky had been the one telling the truth
when her testimony deviated from the president's. ``It's all based
on Monica Lewinsky's testimony,'' he said. While Starr found that
Ms. Lewinsky's testimony matched contemporaneous accounts she gave
to 11 friends of her affair, Nadler said that she may have been
exaggerating to all her friends.
</P>
<P>
   To sort through precedent and the Framers' intent, the
Republican and Democratic staffs of the Judiciary Committee have
independently given their members extensive legal research. The
panel's members say they are studying the writings of legal
scholars, the report on impeachment drawn up by the Judiciary
Committee staff in the Watergate proceedings and other documents.
But impeachment proceedings have been so infrequent that even these
materials can lead to different interpretations.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., who was an aide to the House
Judiciary Committee in 1974, has posted on her Web site the 1974
report on Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment. In a
sign of her own thinking, she pointed her constituents toward its
observations and its conclusion as ``pretty relevant today.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not all presidential misconduct is sufficient to constitute
grounds for an impeachment,'' that 1974 report concluded. ``Because
impeachment of a President is a grave step for the nation, it is
predicated only upon conduct seriously incompatible with either the
constitutional form and principles of our government or the proper
performance of constitutional duties of Presidential office.''
</P>
<P>
   That might seem to suggest that evasions about illicit sex would
not rise to the level of impeachment. But Canady looks elsewhere
for a model: the precedent set by Congress in the impeachment and
conviction of Judge Walter Nixon of federal district court in
Mississippi in 1989 for perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon had been criminally convicted of lying to a grand jury
about his talks with a prosecutor in a marijuana-smuggling case. He
had been accused of concealing his attempt to help the son of a
business partner. ``He was impeached and removed from office
because he committed perjury,'' Canady said, ``and the interesting
thing is he committed perjury before a grand jury on matters where
if he simply told the truth there would have been no legal
responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   Should a judicial impeachment be considered relevant to a
president? Federal judges are not elected but under the
Constitution have lifetime tenure subject to ``good behavior'' in
office. ``It's certainly the case that impeaching a judge and
impeaching a president has two different standards,'' said Rep.
Barney Frank, D-Mass.

CLINTON'S TESTIMONY DOESN'T MATCH THE HYPE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For days, the White House said it was bracing for
public reaction to the broadcast of President Clinton's sometimes
defiant, sometimes elusive grand jury testimony.
</P>
<P>
   But both in its tone and probable impact, the testimony turned
out not to be the tinderbox it was hyped up to be.
</P>
<P>
   The president showed flashes of indignation, waving his hand or
index finger at the camera. Gesturing so emphatically may have been
a tactical error, recalling as it did his infamous, finger-wagging
statement in January that he ``did not have sexual relations with
that woman, Miss (Monica) Lewinsky.'' He later conceded to an
``improper'' relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, what Americans saw on television Monday was their
president sweating.
</P>
<P>
   This was a chief executive unaccompanied by the usual totems of
his office. He shifted uncomfortably in his chair, his eyes darted
from side to side as he awaited his swearing-in. His face appeared
pinched.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, Clinton's private lawyer, had earlier accused
House Republicans of releasing the videotape to ``embarrass the
president.'' The media reported White House anxiety at Americans
seeing a testy Clinton answering prosecutors' questions.
</P>
<P>
   But when the tape was shown, it was clear that the White House
and the news media had overstated the potential for damage.
Compared to what the public had been led to believe about Clinton's
temper, he emerged from the deposition relatively unscathed. The
president generally managed to hold his anger beneath the surface,
making him appear firm but not overtly hostile.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've read a lot of things about what the president's demeanor
would be and how the whole thing would look on television, and it
did not match any of that advance speculation,'' said White House
Press Secretary Mike McCurry.
</P>
<P>
   The video, which was taped at the White House on Aug. 17, seemed
more likely to reinforce existing opinions about the president than
to change minds, according to lawmakers of both parties.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist, said
a White House official told him Monday that the White House had
deliberately tried to overstate Clinton's anger on the tape so they
could later say it wasn't so bad, after all.
</P>
<P>
   While the White House did not confirm such a strategy, Sabato
said the official, whom he would not name, ```was bragging about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the White House) won the PR spin, no question about it.
It's an old political trick,'' Sabato said.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the White House may have, at least temporarily,
slowed impeachment momentum on Capitol Hill by minimizing the
tape's damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``My guess is the reaction (to the videotape) will be less
significant than news people over the weekend were suggesting it
might be,'' said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways Clinton's demeanor was difficult to pin down. He
was often slippery in a legal sense, insisting his intimate
activities with Lewinsky didn't qualify as ``sexual relations''
under the definition he adhered to.
</P>
<P>
   In one exchange, the president quibbled about the definition of
the word ``is'' regarding a previous statement by one of his
attorneys suggesting there ``is no sex of any kind'' with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what the meaning of the word `is' is,'' said
Clinton, a Yale-educated lawyer and former Arkansas attorney
general and governor.
</P>
<P>
   House Republicans seized on Clinton's word plays as evidence he
had something to hide.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. James Rogan, R-Calif., a member of the House Judiciary
Committee, said Clinton had invoked ``minute areas of the law which
to the average person just sound absolutely ludicrous and silly.''
</P>
<P>
   But not all of Clinton's testimony relied on legal intricacies.
He may even have elicited some sympathy by depicting himself to the
grand jurors as a defender of the youthful, idealistic Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been accused by Lewinsky in prosecutors' documents
of using her for an affair, and then dumping her.
</P>
<P>
   But on the videotape, he testified that ``she's a good young
woman with a good heart and a good mind.'' He said, ``It breaks my
heart that she was ever involved in this.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also may have scored public-relations points by saying
his chief accusers are politically motivated, and by invoking his
privacy rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm not trying to be evasive here,'' Clinton testified.
``I'm trying to protect my privacy, my family's privacy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Polls show many Americans, while believing Clinton did something
wrong, are tired of the whole spectacle. The White House was hoping
that four hours of testimony pushed the public past the saturation
point.

NETWORKS DECIDE CLINTON VIDEO GOOD TELEVISION, AFTER ALL 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (a and e coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DON AUCOIN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Somewhat to their surprise, the broadcast networks joined their
cable brethren Monday in televising President Clinton's grand jury
testimony, rather than simply airing excerpts as they had planned.
</P>
<P>
   The chief reason: a transcript of Clinton's videotaped testimony
that was delivered to the networks just a few minutes before they
began broadcasting it. Armed with the transcript, the networks were
able to ascertain in advance that the testimony was not as sexually
explicit as they feared.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the networks simply found that the four hours of
presidential testimony about Clinton's relationship with Monica S.
Lewinsky made for good television. (Not everyone agreed: Boston
television stations were deluged with hundreds of calls from
viewers complaining that their favorite soap operas had been
preempted).
</P>
<P>
   The upshot was that only NBC broke away from the testimony,
declining to broadcast two segments where prosecutors asked Clinton
about particular sexual acts.
</P>
<P>
   ``On a holiday, with a lot of families together and a lot of
young children potentially watching, we just decided to err on the
side of conservatism,'' said Beth O'Connell, executive producer of
special events for NBC News.
</P>
<P>
   When NBC broke away, WHDH-Channel 7, the Boston NBC affiliate,
immediately switched to CNN's coverage. ``We wanted to make sure
our viewers could have the choice to decide if they wanted to turn
down the sound,'' said Channel 7 news director Mark Berryhill. ``We
just wanted the best coverage, whether that comes from NBC or
CNN.''
</P>
<P>
   Except for the segments of four and six minutes, respectively,
NBC aired the rest of Clinton's testimony. ABC and CBS broadcast it
in its entirety, along with the cable networks CNN, MSNBC, Fox News
Channel, and C-SPAN.
</P>
<P>
   For the broadcast networks, it was a day of scrambling to keep
ahead of the videotape. Even as the testimony was broadcast to a
national audience, network personnel raced through hundreds of
pages of transcript. At NBC, O'Connell said, a news division vice
president, numerous correspondents and producers, and even the
network ombudsman were enlisted in the network's ``very elaborate
system'' for reading the transcripts.
</P>
<P>
   ABC, which had planned last week to air only the first five
minutes of Clinton's testimony before cutting away and then airing
excerpts, ended up broadcasting the entire testimony unedited.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once it started, it was simply more compelling than we thought
it was going to be,'' acknowledged ABC spokeswoman Eileen Murphy.
``And there was really less explicit and graphic material than we
expected.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, although ABC employed a 5-second delay so it could edit
out anything the network deemed offensive, no editing occurred. The
network did air an onscreen advisory warning of ``graphic sexual
content.''
</P>
<P>
   The availability of a transcript made the decision easier at
CBS, which last week said it would make no decision on airing the
testimony until network executives got a look at it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the feed of the tape started coming in, we had a
transcript, so we were able to look ahead and get a sense of what
was in the tape,'' said CBS spokeswoman Sandy Genelius.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony videotape was broken up into seven parts; CBS
aired the first three parts live, the next three with a 10-second
delay and an advisory warning of ``strong language and sexual
content,'' and the last part live.

<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Introducing himself as ``a man of the East''
from ``a great and renowned nation,'' President Mohammad Khatami of
Iran tried to woo his global audience Monday with talk of how
freedom-loving and law-abiding Iran is these days and asked for
help in resolving the crisis in neighboring Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
   In his first address to the General Assembly _ and his first
trip to the United States _ Khatami quoted from the New Testament,
the Koran and 13th-century Iranian poetry in arguing in
philosophical language that dialogue is the key to understanding
among nations.
</P>
<P>
   What was remarkable about the speech is what it did not say.
</P>
<P>
   There was not a word of criticism of the United States. Indeed,
the only direct reference to the United States was an expression of
confidence that ``powerful nations, such as the American people,''
will reject the idea that one nation should aim to rule the world
as its only superpower.
</P>
<P>
   There was much milder criticism of Israel than usual, and
certainly no call to free Jerusalem from Israeli rule and no attack
of the 1992 peace agreement between Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   And there was no threat to invade Afghanistan, despite the
presence of 200,000 Iranian troops on the Afghan border and Iran's
relentless condemnation of the repression of Afghanistan under the
rule of the militant Taliban movement. In fact, Khatami said,
``there is no military solution to that country's predicament.''
</P>
<P>
   Khatami branded the recent killing of nine Iranian diplomats and
a journalist by the Sunni Muslim Taliban part of a pattern of
genocide against Shiite Muslims and called on the United Nations to
bring all the warring parties into negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   After Khatami's speech and an eight-country meeting on
Afghanistan sponsored by the United Nations that included the
United States and Iran, James Rubin, the State Department
spokesman, said Washington was encouraged by Khatami and other
Iranian officials who said they wanted a peaceful resolution to the
Afghan crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing a tan clerical robe, a sheer black cloak and the black
turban that signifies he is a descendant of Mohammed, Khatami
seemed more eager to present himself as a global philosopher than a
politician with an agenda for change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Allow me to speak here as a man from the East, the origin of
brilliant civilizations and the birthplace of Divine Prophets:
Abraham, Moses, Jesus and Mohammed, peace be upon them all,''
Khatami said. ``I come from the noble land of Iran, representing a
great and renowned nation, famous for its age-old civilization as
well as its distinguished contribution to the founding and
expansion of the Islamic civilization.''
</P>
<P>
   As he spoke, a woman burst past guards into the General Assembly
hall and screamed that Khatami was a murderer and torturer. The
woman, identified by U.N. officials as Laila Jazayeri, a
37-year-old Iranian, was subdued by the U.N. security police, who
handcuffed her and strapped her to a wheelchair before turning her
over to the New York police.
</P>
<P>
   A block away from the United Nations, about 2,000 demonstrators
representing the U.S.-based National Council of Resistance of Iran
protested Khatami's visit and demanded the overthrow of the Tehran
government. The protesters were joined by Sen. Robert Torricelli,
D-N.J., and two Democratic Reps., Carolyn Maloney of New York and
Robert Menendez of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The last time an Iranian president addressed the General
Assembly was in 1987, at the height of Iran's eight-year war with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   The president at that time, Ali Khamenei, who is now its
spiritual leader, delivered a speech that blasted the United
Nations as ``a paper factory for issuing worthless and ineffective
orders'' and the United States as a lying, imperial-minded ``Great
Satan'' whose military activities in the Persian Gulf had turned
the region into a ``dangerous powder keg.''
</P>
<P>
   In his current position, Khamenei is in charge of the armed
forces, the intelligence and security forces, the judiciary and
radio and television, and wields much more power than the
president. But Khatami's only reference to the ayatollah Monday was
to reaffirm support for his proposal that an Islamic country be
made a permanent member in the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
   Since Khatami became president 13 months ago one of his main
themes has been the need for a ``dialogue among civilizations,''
code words for bridging the gap between an Islamic regime like
Iran, which is still subject to American economic sanctions, and
secular nations around the world.
</P>
<P>
   So it was not surprising that his main proposal Monday was that
the United Nations declare 2001 the ``year of dialogue among
civilizations.'' But so far Iran has rejected an American proposal
for an official political dialogue with the United States, and
Khatami made no mention of it in his speech Monday.
</P>
<P>
   As for Israeli-Palestinian relations, Khatami said that peace
and security would come to the Middle East only when all
Palestinians had the right to ``exercise sovereignty over their
ancestral homeland'' and blamed Israel for making co-existence in
Jerusalem impossible.
</P>
<P>
   ``Palestine,'' he added, is the homeland of Muslims, Christians
and Jews, ``not the laboratory for the violent whims of Zionists.''
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Iran has muted its opposition to the
Israeli-Palestinian agreement, but it still supports guerrillas in
Lebanon intent on sabotaging the peace effort.
</P>
<P>
   The State Department, in its most recent annual report on
terrorism, ranked Iran as the world's leading state sponsor of
terrorism, but Khatami insisted Iran was a victim, not a
perpetrator of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   And he called for the world to be ``liberated'' from nuclear
weapons and other weapons of mass destruction. The United States
believes Iran is intent on developing a nuclear weapon, a charge
Iran denies.

UNIVERSITY RELISHES VISIT FROM CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Jay Oliva, the president of New York University,
likes to describe the school as a reflection of the city: a world
compressed into a village that is at once neighborly, multicultural
and second to none when it comes to self-promotion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I firmly believe that if you're doing something interesting,
you ought to tell people about it,'' Oliva said. ``And if you're
blowing your own horn, do it loudly. There's no sense giving it a
little toot.''
</P>
<P>
   The scrappy university, always looking to raise its profile in
the intensely competitive world of higher education, made some big
noise Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The NYU School of Law played host to President Clinton and
Hillary Rodham Clinton, as well as other stars of the political and
academic worlds, at a forum on globalization just as the
president's videotaped testimony before the Starr grand jury was
released to the public on network and cable television.
</P>
<P>
   Some university officials had worried that the latest disclosure
from the independent counsel's investigation might upstage what the
law school called its ``megasummit,'' which was beamed by satellite
to 20 universities around the United States and in Europe and
simultaneously shown live over the NYU Web site.
</P>
<P>
   But having Clinton and the first lady on campus at a time when
dozens of American and foreign journalists were on hand to
scrutinize their every move, exchange and reaction, turned out to
be a happy convergence of events for the university.
</P>
<P>
   The place was packed, monied alumni were in great abundance, and
Clinton joined such political figures as Prime Ministers Tony Blair
of Britain and Romano Prodi of Italy in expressing effusive thanks
for having been invited.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is literally a unique moment on this extraordinary day,''
responded John Sexton, the dean of the law school, who had
conceived of and organized the high-profile event.
</P>
<P>
   Sexton, who described himself as ``the P.T. Barnum of legal
education,'' said the forum, which was called Strengthening
Democracy in the Global Economy, was meant to showcase what the
school calls its global law school initiative.
</P>
<P>
   The global law program was created five years ago, he said, and
incorporated into the traditional NYU Law School to infuse the
school with an international outlook that takes into account the
increasing globalization of political and economic institutions.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, Sexton said, his colleagues at other schools
teased him that he was dean of ``the first intergalactic law
school.''
</P>
<P>
   But by hiring top foreign legal experts from the Middle East,
Asia and Europe, and revamping the way some law subjects are
taught, he said, New York University's law school has become a
pioneer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's now clear we went to a place where the rest of legal
education is going to strive to be five or 10 years from now,''
Sexton said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that the daylong forum, which featured three panel
discussions on civil society, economics and democracy, ``is a
visible manifestation'' of what the law school has been doing on a
less glittery scale.
</P>
<P>
   Oliva, the NYU president, said that the university had begun
organizing the forum less than two months ago, and that from the
start, it was to revolve around the Clintons.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Life around Washington Square, across from the law school, came
to a standstill for the day. The western half of the square was
closed, several Greenwich Village streets were closed to traffic
and the streets around the law school were clogged with enormous
vans that held the digital production equipment needed to broadcast
the forum by satellite.
</P>
<P>
   Several students who had won a lottery for seats to watch the
forum on closed-circuit television in the law school said they had
the technical advantage of seeing Clinton twice _ and in any order
they wished. The forum was beamed into dormitory rooms and student
centers on the university network, while the presidential testimony
was available on commercial television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I watched the Clinton videotape on TV all morning,'' said
Jasmine Campirides, a third-year student who attended a panel
session to see the president. ``And I have a VCR, so I taped the
first panel from the forum so I can watch it at home later.''

HISTORY LESSONS IN TORONTO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ What's this? The Ryan Minor Era has come and gone
already?
</P>
<P>
   Fresh from his 1-for-3 showing against the Yankees Sunday night,
the former University of Oklahoma basketball star was riding the
pine again at SkyDome Monday night. The old guy with the thinning
gray hair was back in the lineup, batting sixth and playing third
base. For those of you counting at home, the new Cal Ripken streak
is 1.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting out against Orlando Hernandez was one thing, but taking
a seat when Roger Clemens was trying to nail down a record-breaking
fifth Cy Young Award (not to mention attempting to keep his team's
fading wild card hopes alive) was quite obviously another. Cal had
done what he had to do in Baltimore. Now he could resume what
passes for normal in his life.
</P>
<P>
   And what Cal did in Baltimore on Monday was clearly the right
thing for all concerned. Let there be no mistake about that.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major thing is that he did it himself,'' observes Pat
Gillick, the soon-to-be ex-general manager of the Orioles. ``He did
it of his own volition. It now gives the manager the flexibility to
pull him in and out of the lineup. No matter what anyone says, the
streak was intimidating to the manager. Since the streak is broken
now, Ray (Miller) is free to use Cal as he wishes. It was a pretty
good deal for him.''
</P>
<P>
   What wasn't such a good deal for Baltimore was the presence of
Clemens on the mound. They probably had no right to hope that
Monday night's game would turn out to be much different from most
of the 20 since Roger sustained his last loss back on May 29 (think
of what we didn't know about Monica way back when). And it wasn't.
In eight innings of work he allowed seven hits and one run. He
struck out 15. Having thrown 134 pitches, he departed in favor of
Paul Quantrill with a 3-1 lead, but not before getting B.J. Surhoff
looking for K No. 15 to close out the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   That gives him a reasonable claim to his fifth Cy, wouldn't you
say? He is 20-6. He leads the league in wins, strikeouts (260),
earned run average (2.58), and a half-dozen other categories they
didn't know about 50 years ago. And, oh yes, he has won 15
straight. I'd say case closed, wouldn't you?
</P>
<P>
   As for Cal, whatever options the beleaguered skipper of
baseball's single most disappointing team will choose to exercise
lie in the future. There, as usual, was Cal, joining such veterans
as Roberto Alomar, Brady Anderson, Harold Baines, Rafael Palmeiro,
Surhoff, and Mike Bordick in the lineup against a man whose every
appearance nowadays signifies an assault on the record book.
Against a lineup like that, Roger was engaged in the resumption of
some personal rivalries with a little mold on them.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that among the seven aforementioned vets, there had
been an accumulated 81 career Clemens strikeouts. On the plus side,
these guys had managed to reach the Rocket for a total of 13 home
runs. He knew all about them, and vice-versa.
</P>
<P>
   Clemens is at the stage of his career where each game has a
double inference. There's the here and now and there's the Clemens
place in history. By the end of the fifth inning he had thrown a
few more logs on the record book fire, having struck out 10 men for
the 92d time in his career and having fanned the side for the 117th
and 118th times in his fairly amazin' career (13th and 14th times
in '98).
</P>
<P>
   The fourth inning was somewhat, well, you know, routine, as
Roger allowed a leadoff double to Palmeiro and then got Willie
Greene, Ripken, and Surhoff on 14 pitches. But the fifth was a
Clemens special. In the midst of allowing two hits and a run, he
huffed and puffed his way through four full counts and 37 pitches.
But did he fan Charlie Greene, Alomar and, finally, Willie Greene?
Uh-huh, uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   Solo homers in the third by Shawn Green and Carlos Delgado in
the third had given him a 2-1 lead over Scott Erickson, but it
didn't appear very likely he'd be picking up his sixth complete
game, not after throwing 106 pitches through five innings.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is likewise linked with more than the mere present. Just
about every time he manages to get a base hit he finds himself
entwined with someone of note. Monday night, for example, his
second-inning single to left gave him career base hit number 2,873,
and you'll never guess whom he passed on the all-time list. Some
guy named Ruth; that's all.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't Cal's night. It was Roger's.

LEWINSKY'S TESTIMONY WAS CANDID, DETAILED 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TONY FREEMANTLE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ At the end of her grueling appearance before the
grand jury investigating her relationship with President Clinton,
Monica Lewinsky began to cry as a juror asked her if there was
anything she wished to add to her testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would,'' she said. `` ...I would just like to say that no
one ever asked me to lie and I was never promised a job for my
silence. And that I'm sorry. I'm really sorry for everything that
has happened. And I hate Linda Tripp.''
</P>
<P>
   On a day dominated by release of the videotaped testimony of her
paramour, Lewinsky's full, painful account to the grand jury of her
relationship with the president also was released.
</P>
<P>
   In more than 500 pages of her own words, Lewinsky reveals
herself as a vulnerable but self-assured young woman who goes to
Washington as an intern at the White House and ends up betrayed and
in tears, being questioned by a team of determined lawyers about
her intimate secrets.
</P>
<P>
   If there is any one thing that distinguishes Lewinsky's
testimony from that of Clinton's, it is that while Clinton relies
on his vast experience and legal training to spar with prosecutors,
bemoaning on occasion the fact that his celebrated memory had
abandoned him, Lewinsky's is studded with the kind of detail the
young and in love tend to remember.
</P>
<P>
   She remembers dates, times, names, what was said to whom and who
gave what to whom. She recalls the weather on particular days that
she visited the Oval Office. She virtually memorized every message
the president left on her machine. She sometimes apologizes to the
jurors and the prosecutors questioning her for providing too much
detail, for going on too long in response to their probing.
</P>
<P>
   And she remembers the sense of betrayal when she realizes that
the love she felt for the president was not reciprocated and that
Tripp, a former colleague at the Pentagon and a principal
confidant, had taped their telephone conversations. In those
conversations, Lewinsky revealed her relationship with Clinton.
Tripp turned the material over to independent counselor Kenneth
Starr.
</P>
<P>
   In return for immunity from prosecution, Lewinsky agreed to
cooperate with the prosecutor. Her testimony was recorded in two
sessions before the grand jury on Aug. 6 and Aug. 20 and in a
deposition to Starr's prosecutors on Aug. 26.
</P>
<P>
   But even without that cooperation, it was revealed Monday, Starr
already had a pretty good picture of the relationship, gleaned from
evidence Lewinsky left behind.
</P>
<P>
   A message on her computer, for instance, revealed a young woman
whose relationship was slipping away from her.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe the time has finally come for me to throw in the
towel,'' she wrote. ``I give up. You let me down, but I shouldn't
have trusted you in the first place.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the more salacious details revealed by Lewinsky in
describing her sexual encounters with Clinton have already been
released in the main body of Starr's report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The release of all the material Monday does not significantly
add to what is already known. And what is known is that on at least
10 occasions, between the time the relationship began in the fall
of 1995 to its conclusion in early 1997, Lewinsky and the president
had sexual relations in the White House, although, as they both
testified, they never had intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky testified that it was both hers and the president's
desire to keep their relationship secret. He never told her to lie
about it, she said, but he also never told her not to lie about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure, as everyone can imagine, that this is a kind of
relationship that you keep quiet,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   But despite that, Lewinsky testified that she told numerous
people about the relationship, including her mother, her aunt and,
perhaps most fatefully, Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   But what kind of relationship was it? When questioned by a grand
juror whether she loved the president or whether theirs was simply
a relationship based on mutual lust, Lewinsky said Clinton had a
``beautiful soul. I just thought he was just this incredible person
and when I looked at him I saw a little boy and _ I don't know what
the truth is anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very compatible sexually,'' she said ``I've always
felt that he was sort of my sexual soul mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is ambivalent about most of the characters in this
saga. The president is ``handsome'' or ``delicious'' or
``heavenly'' when the relationship was going well, but ``schmucko''
and ``creep'' when he is trying to break it off. Vernon Jordan, the
president's close friend to whom Lewinsky turned when she was
subpoenaed in the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit against the
president, is the one person she believes did right by her.
</P>
<P>
   Most of her anger is reserved for Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   At one point during her testimony, one of the prosecutors says
he would like to return to the subject of Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ugh,'' Lewinsky replies.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not she was prompted by the president she doesn't
say, but, Lewinsky repeatedly sought out Jordan for help in finding
a job in New York after her employment prospects at the White House
faded and for advice on what to do about being subpoenaed in the
Jones case. At first, Lewinsky did not tell Jordan she was having a
sexual relationship with Clinton, only that they were having phone
sex and that she was concerned someone may have listened to their
conversations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Jordan said, `Well, you know, so what? The president's
allowed to call people.' And I said, `Well, we've had phone sex.'
And so Mr. Jordan said `Well, what's phone sex?' And so I said,
`Well, you know what phone sex is.' And he said, `No I don't. I'm
just an old man. I don't know what phone sex is.'''
</P>
<P>
   When he did find out later that Lewinsky and the president were
having a lot more than telephone sex, Lewinsky testified that
Jordan's response was ``Mmmph.''
</P>
<P>
   Time and again in her testimony and in other evidence collected
by Starr, Lewinsky reveals her petulance at not getting her way
with the president, on one occasion throwing a tantrum outside the
White House until being admitted to see him.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1997, when Clinton is trying to end the relationship,
she wrote a note that read: ``Please do not do this to me (all
seven words underlined). I feel disposable, used and
insignificant.''
</P>
<P>
   On another occasion, Lewinsky was trying to get to talk to the
president about an affidavit she was preparing in the Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutor Michael Emmick asked Lewinsky about her frame of mind
that day.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh! You really want to embarrass me,'' Lewinsky replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, I just want to get the mood right,'' Emmick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had been peeved by the photo and the footage that was in the
media from the president and first lady being romantic on their
holiday vacation,'' Lewinsky said, referring to a picture of the
Clintons on the beach. ``I was jealous and it just seemed sort of
something he had ... never really revealed to me and it made me
feel bad.''
</P>
<P>
   But for all her peevishness, Lewinsky just as often reveals her
vulnerability, nowhere more so than toward the end of her testimony
when she described the day in 1997 when, with the world closing in
around her, she had lunch with her friend Tripp, who was wearing a
hidden microphone for the Starr team. Lewinsky was later
``detained'' by Emmick and FBI agents who threatened her with up to
27 years in jail for perjury, subornation of perjury and witness
tampering.
</P>
<P>
   In tears, and wanting to talk to her mother, Lewinsky testified
she felt ``so bad'' because she had pulled the president into this.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just cried for a long time,'' she said.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ENYOKENI ROYAL RESIDENCE, South Africa _ To Western eyes, it may
seem odd that 2,000 girls who are here to be sternly lectured about
virginity are also heavily pressured to strip off almost every
stitch of their clothing.
</P>
<P>
   But that's the reed dance.
</P>
<P>
   And to the Zulu, the custom makes perfect sense. The proof that
a virgin is a virgin is that she is proud of her pure body. Some of
the girls dancing before King Goodwill Zwelithini recently even
wore beadwork aprons with the words ``intombi nto'' _ ``straight
girl'' _ beaded into them.
</P>
<P>
   The reed dance is a Zulu and Swazi rite of spring danced before
the king every September, when spring comes to the Southern
Hemisphere. The 30-year-old king of nearby Swaziland held his on
Sept. 4, and chose his newest wife from among the dancers _ another
royal privilege, since the dance is also a kind of debutante ball.
</P>
<P>
   Here in KwaZulu/Natal, the ancient dance has recently become
more political. Besides being a nation-building spectacle, it is a
subtle minuet in the struggle for influence between the 50-year-old
King and his 70-year-old cousin, Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, head
of the Inkatha Freedom Party. It has also, in the last three years,
become a new front in the battle against AIDS.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, young girls from all over the king's domain cut
reeds to present him for roofing his huts and lining his cattle
pen. The sight is glorious _ hundreds of 5-foot girls bearing
25-foot reeds like lances, pennant tops waving in the breeze,
weaving slowly in dancing regiments, the first formed entirely of
princesses, up the road to the king's stockade.
</P>
<P>
   The king, dressed in leopard skins, carrying a cowhide shield
and gold battle-ax and surrounded by his warriors, waits to meet
them, kisses one of his daughters and accepts the first reed from
her while praise-singers shout the family history to an awed knot
of guests.
</P>
<P>
   In the background, three oxen chosen for the night's feast are
being butchered, hunks of meat the size of car doors hanging on the
corral fence.
</P>
<P>
   There are incongruous modern touches. The king wears expensive
Italian sandals, and one of his headmen is in Converse running
shoes. The grounds are full of circus tents where the girls will
sleep that night. And they arrive on buses from faraway cities like
Durban, pulling off sweaters and flowered underwear under the eyes
of their headwomen and the lenses of television news crews, then
donning scant dress for the dance.
</P>
<P>
   Only those in strictly traditional garb _ three-inch-wide bead
belts with tiny aprons, not modern cotton miniskirts _ are allowed
in the front ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Do the cameras and the male onlookers bother these girls, who
usually wear school uniforms and other teen-age-style clothes?
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Nombuhle Buthelezi and Mbalentle Zwane, who had led
a high-kicking dance in a circle of 50 classmates. They
participate, they said, ``because we are virgins,'' explaining that
they did not mind the cameras and wanted only ``to set a good
example to others'' and please their parents, who ``love this
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' said Princess Sdudozo Ndlovu, 23, daughter of the king's
sister and a student at Natal Technical College, who was here with
classmates filming a documentary on the festivities. ``I have been
doing this since I was 4 or 5. People can see how fat I am, but I
like to show myself. You are saying, `Look at me. I'm proud.'''
</P>
<P>
   The reed dance was always nominally reserved for virgins, but
that has taken on new emphasis since AIDS began to ravage rural
Zulu villages. Many of the dance groups are run by Flowers of the
Nation, a movement started in 1995 with the patronage of the royal
family to encourage chastity.
</P>
<P>
   Its symbol is a long Zulu shield between two red ribbons. Girls
are encouraged to form clubs to discuss sex and marriage; the
headwomen quiz the boys whom the girls express an interest in.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   There are monthly visual virginity checks, an old Zulu custom
that had fallen into disuse. The national health minister, Dr.
Nkosazana Zuma, herself a Zulu princess, endorses the practice.
</P>
<P>
   As Princess Dumezweni Mahlango, a patron of Flowers of the
Nation, put it, ``We are teaching them in traditional ways, not
telling people about condoms and whatever.''
</P>
<P>
   After the dancing, as the girls shivered on a chilly, overcast
afternoon, the king gave a long, sometimes laughter-provoking
speech extolling traditional values. ``Men used to go to the river
to propose to girls,'' he said. ``That has changed because we have
taps in our homes.'' Since girls went to the river in groups, older
sisters would grill the boys to see if their intentions were
honorable. The king wants the custom revived. ``We must show other
people the self-respect of the Zulus,'' he said, urging the girls
to show virtue.
</P>
<P>
   The king also reminded the girls of the dangers of sexually
transmitted diseases and the humiliation of divorce _ a woman who
cheats is sent back to her family, who sometimes have to pay a cow
as a peace offering. ``Even grandmothers who sleep around can get
HIV _ anyone can get HIV,'' the king counseled. ``Stick to one man
from the beginning until you die.''
</P>
<P>
   Many rural women are infected by their husbands, but because the
men often work in cities, there were very few youths to be lectured
to behave themselves too.
</P>
<P>
   After the speeches, the royal family passed out T-shirts that
read ``I am a virgin'' on the back.
</P>
<P>
   The ceremony has other undertones that hint at the internal
politics of Zulu nationalism. The king and Chief Buthelezi had a
nasty public severance of ties in 1994. The king tried to cancel
late-September Zulu festivities that year, and the chief retaliated
by calling boycotts of ceremonies that the king favored.
</P>
<P>
   The royal patronage of Flowers of the Nation led to larger
crowds here. ``People had been dragging their feet,'' said Khumlane
Mahlangu, a member of the royal household and an organizer. ``The
king should have thousands of people to address, not 30. Somebody
had to take the initiative to revive this ceremony.''
</P>
<P>
   This year's reed dance was the biggest in many years, observers
said. Buthelezi did not attend, but prominent members of his party
did, which local journalists said was significant.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1997 the feud seems to have abated, as both the king and
Buthelezi have forged good relationships with Mandela, and neither
has been left powerless in the new South Africa ruled by the
African National Congress.
</P>
<P>
   On a broader scale, Zulu nationalism and calls for an
independent kingdom have all but disappeared from public debate,
and the political violence once rampant in the province is now
largely confined to the Richmond area, where a new political party,
the United Democratic Movement, appears to be fighting with the
ANC, not Buthelezi's Inkatha.
</P>
<P>
   In about three months, on a date to be set by the king, will be
the boys' ceremony, the first fruits dance. As a symbol of national
unity it is not nearly so gentle. To signal that his people may eat
the season's crops, the king, dressed in green plants, smashes a
pumpkin. Then he and his warriors proceed into the corral and beat
an ox to death with their fists.
</P>
<P>
   Naked girls may be photographed, but those rites cannot. The
king in green and the death of the ox, said Mahlangu, ``are not to
be seen by everyone _ not even all Zulus.''

   The sportswriters and coaches who cast their ballots for the
country's best Division I college football teams probably don't do
it quite like Mike DeSimone of Clarksboro, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   While writers and coaches mull their choices between deadlines
and game films, DeSimone uses a more scientific method _
mathematical algorithms _ to determine his order.
</P>
<P>
   DeSimone posts his weekly rankings at his 1998 College Football
Division I-A Top 25 Ratings page
(www.algorithms.com/users/desimone/top25.htm). For the past two
years, putting the page together has been a pastime for the college
football fan/mathematician.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't agree with the national polls, so I decided to come
up with my own,'' DeSimone said.
</P>
<P>
   DeSimone, who works for a consulting firm in Radnor, Pa., spends
20 to 40 hours per week compiling information from other Web sites
and using his mathematical methods to churn the data. Factors such
as returning key players, coaching experience, last year's rating
and the weighting of opponents are fed into DeSimone's mathematical
methods.

IRANIAN FAILS TO APPEAR AT THE AFGHAN TALKS ATTENDED BY ALBRIGHT  
(JT)

   UNITED NATIONS _ What was expected to be the first high-level
meeting in two decades between Iran and the United States did not
occur Monday because Iran's foreign minister did not show up for a
conference on Afghanistan attended by Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after the meeting that the Iranians announced why
their foreign minister, Kamal Kharazi, was represented by one of
his deputies. He was said to be occupied accompanying Iran's
president, Mohammad Khatami, on his New York rounds.
</P>
<P>
   Albright's spokesman, James Rubin, rejected the suggestion that
the secretary of state had been snubbed by the Iranians.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was not a U.S.-Iranian meeting,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting was a higher-level version of at least half a dozen
consultations attended over the last year by Russia, the United
States and the six neighbors of Afghanistan _ Iran, Turkmenistan,
Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, China and Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   Those nations decided Monday to support a mission to the region
by Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special envoy for Afghanistan,
Lakhdar Brahimi, and by the Islamic Conference Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The group also called for international investigations into the
killings of Iranian diplomats and a journalist, as well as
unconfirmed reports of massacres in areas recently conquered by the
Taliban.
</P>
<P>
   Missing from the conference room was any representative of
Afghanistan, which is now almost completely controlled by the
Taliban movement. It has been denied the country's seat here until
it meets a number of conditions on human rights and power sharing
being pushed by the United States. The seat is held by an alliance
of opposition groups that hold almost no remaining territory.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the Taliban said after the meeting that
being frozen out of discussions on the country's future only made
cooperation less likely.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all legitimate standards applied to other countries,'' said
Noorullah Zadran, deputy representative of the Taliban office in
New York, ``we are the government of Afghanistan. It is ridiculous
to think that anyone can claim to solve Afghanistan's problems
without addressing us. They aren't even willing to concede that we
control over 95 percent of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We are as broad-based a government as Afghanistan has had in
over 20 years,'' Zadran said. ``We have the overwhelming support of
the population across ethnic lines.''
</P>
<P>
   Fighting has continued in Kabul, the Afghan capital; this
weekend more than 50 people were killed and nearly 200 wounded from
rocket attacks. The opposition leader Ahmed Shah Masood denied that
his group was responsible, but said it had fired rockets near the
airport on Sunday.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After Iran, which has massed more than 100,000 troops near the
Afghan border, the United States has taken the hardest line against
the Taliban. Rubin characterized their goals as the imposition of
``narrow and autocratic fundamentalism.'' Albright has called their
treatment of women despicable.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's meeting was opened by the secretary-general, who
suggested that it might be time to confront reality and think more
about how to deal with the Taliban, ``the side that appears to have
made sizable gains and _ for the moment at least _ is in control of
most of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Taliban need to be told what the international community
expects of them by way of minimum standards of behavior, and this
group is well placed to start the process,'' Annan told ministers
from the eight nations.
</P>
<P>
   Iran is pressing for a Security Council resolution condemning
the Taliban for the murder of diplomats.

HULL NO LONGER SINGS THE BLUES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE HEIKA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's hard to stop Brett Hull from smiling, but the sight of a
St. Louis Blues jersey did at training camp.
</P>
<P>
   Hull often drew attention from fans and autograph seekers last
week, and one youngster asked him to sign a Blues sweater with
``Hull'' and the traditional No. 16 on the back.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK. You're lucky because I'm only going to do this one time,''
Hull said, seemingly joking with the youngster. ``This is the last
time I ever sign anything from the Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   After the crowd cleared, a reporter asked Hull if he had been
joking.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said with a straight face to emphasize his decision.
``I don't play for them anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   After 10 years in the Blues' organization, Hull walked away July
3, signing a three-year contract with the Stars. He returned to the
Gateway City for last night's preseason game wearing a star on his
chest and No. 22 on his back instead of the famed Bluenote and No.
16.
</P>
<P>
   Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said he hoped to get the hoopla of
Hull's return out of the way in a meaningless game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen it done both ways before, and it definitely works
best when you get them in early,'' Hitchcock said. ``There's just
so much to deal with, friends, media, everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Hull's break with the Blues was not without controversy. Before
the Cardinals' Mark McGwire came to town, Hull was the
most-celebrated athlete in St. Louis. He said he wanted to stay
with the Blues but refused to do so without a no-trade clause in
his contract. Blues management offered a three-year, $15 million
deal but not a no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   The Stars scooped him up with a $17 million deal that includes a
modified no-trade clause.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what (the Blues) just decided was it wasn't going to
work out and they didn't want an unhappy Brett Hull there,'' Hull
said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hull at times had the blues in St. Louis. In two years with
coach Mike Keenan, he was miserable, he said. He was frustrated
when the organization traded away talent such as Adam Oates, Curtis
Joseph and Brendan Shanahan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody stuck around to develop any chemistry,'' Hull said.
</P>
<P>
   This season, Hull saw the team leaning toward rebuilding again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean they're strong on getting a great defense, and they'll
pay for that, but they'll build with youth on offense,'' he said.
``It's not a bad way to build, but sooner or later you have to
build on offense, as well. ``This team (the Stars) is to the point
where they have the perfect balance... I haven't been this excited
about playing hockey in a long time.'' &QL; 
STARS MAKE CUTS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars sent six players back to their junior teams yesterday
and sent another to the training camp of their International Hockey
affiliate in Kalamazoo, Mich. Returning to their junior teams are
Steven Gainey (Kamloops), John Erskine (London), Tyler Bouck
(Prince George), Lance Galbraith (Ottawa), Darryl Hay (Tri-Cities)
and Jeff McKercher (Barrie). Goalie Harlin Hayes went to the
K-Wings. &QL; 
FINAL LEG &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Stars play their third preseason road game in three nights
tonight when they meet the expansion Nashville Predators in Little
Rock, Ark. The Predators are playing all their preseason games on
the road to try to build a following.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In an extraordinary and grueling display, President
Clinton's grand jury testimony was broadcast to the nation Monday
as a centerpiece in his possible impeachment, with Clinton
alternately argumentative and contrite, furious and crestfallen as
he dueled with criminal prosecutors over perjury allegations in the
White House sex scandal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd give anything in the world not to have to admit what I've
had to admit today,'' the president declared dolefully in his
four-hour video-taped testimony. Even so, he repeatedly rebuffed
prosecutors' attempts to have him discuss in detail his sexual
misconduct with Monica Lewinsky, the former White House intern, and
the seven months of denials that followed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's words echoed through office warrens and family rooms
as a team of prosecutors led by Whitewater independent counsel
Kenneth Starr aggressively bored in on the chief executive in the
Aug. 17 White House testimony in seeking grounds for Congress to
remove him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have seen this four-year, $40-million investigation come
down to parsing of the definition of sex,'' the president
complained in a broadside at Starr, who used his original
Whitewater mandate to branch out into the sex-and-mendacity
allegations of presidential misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   As the nation was transfixed by the televised spectacle of
Clinton's being the first president to testify as a criminal
target, the scandal inquiry moved apace on Capitol Hill. The House
Judiciary Committee released thousands of pages of additional
evidence, notably the full grand jury testimony of Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody ever asked me to lie,'' said Ms. Lewinsky, who
delighted Clintonites by testifying that at different points she
had told lies to Linda Tripp, Ms. Lewinsky's erstwhile friend who
furtively taped her tales of a presidential affair. Ms. Lewinsky
said Ms. Tripp also had encouraged her to keep the notoriously
stained dress as evidence of her interplay with the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stabbed her in the back,'' the president said in his own
testimony, speaking of Ms. Tripp's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Starr's report has noted that the FBI found some
of the Tripp recordings are duplicate tapes, raising the
possibility that ``she has lied under oath'' in testifying that all
were originals.
</P>
<P>
   With additional material expected within the week, there was no
immediate measure of how the public airing of the presidential
testimony might affect House members who have been predicting a
formal impeachment inquiry. Many of them have already concluded
Clinton lied but are pondering whether that merits impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton admitted to ``inappropriate intimate contact'' with Ms.
Lewinsky, but he adamantly resisted attempts to prove that he had
misused his office, suborned perjury or lied in the earlier Paula
Jones civil lawsuit deposition in which he denied having sexual
intercourse with Ms. Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   ``These encounters did not consist of sexual intercourse,'' the
president maintained, denying that the instances of oral sex
described to the grand jury by Ms. Lewinsky amounted to evidence of
perjury. He contended there was a ``common understanding'' among
Americans that sexual relations must include intercourse.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet the grand jurors, if they were talking about people
they know, and said they have a sexual relationship, they meant
they were sleeping together; they meant they were having
intercourse together,'' Clinton declared looking directly at the
camera in facing the grand jury and, now, the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As it developed, grand jurors sent back word from the panel room
down Pennsylvania Avenue that they were not satisfied and wanted
him to answer more directly and specifically. But the president
politely refused to accommodate them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not want to discuss something that is intensely painful
to me,'' he declared in refusing to venture beyond his careful
admission of ``inappropriate intimate contact.'' The issue is
crucial, for an admission to outright perjury in the Jones suit
would feed the mood of House Republicans to open an impeachment
inquiry and eventually present charges for Clinton's trial in the
Senate.
</P>
<P>
   The president's testimony filled a 3,183-page book that was
instantly on sale across the nation, replete with photographic
evidence of the Lewinsky assignation dress. Even more, the
testimony produced countless moments of embarrassment for Clinton,
who at one point denied any knowledge of Ms. Lewinsky's assertion
that he had once talked to her of leaving the first lady.
</P>
<P>
   For all the hard-eyed adversarial stakes, Clinton managed at
times to smile and be genial in answering, as when he declared he
was unsurprised that Ms. Lewinsky told people about her dealings
with him. ``She couldn't help it; it's part of her psyche,'' said
the president who last January denied he had sex with ``that
woman.''
</P>
<P>
   In an avuncular tone, he maintained he only tried to help her
find a job out of friendship, not anti-prosecutorial intrigue at
the White House. ``She's a good young woman with a good young
heart,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, the city was awash in partisan post-mortems, with
Democrats noting the prosecutors did not pursue such once headlined
issues as the ``talking points'' memo. Republicans insisted that,
even allowing for Clinton's qualified definition of sex, Ms.
Lewinsky testified clearly that he had touched her intimately, even
by the Jones suit definition. Michael McCurry, the president's
spokesman, said the testimony mainly showed how prosecutors sought
to ``browbeat and badger'' Clinton and that its release by House
Republicans was steeped in ``rank partisanship.''
</P>
<P>
   The president attempted a course in which was he alternately
apologetic for his personal behavior and firmly defensive of his
national stewardship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did what people do when they do the wrong thing,'' Clinton
summarized of his sexual misbehavior and his attempts to keep it
private. ``I tried to do it when nobody else was looking.''

 WASHINGTON: was looking.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Prosecutors, delving into ever deepening levels of embarassing
detail _ even mentioning the use of ``sexual aid'' _ took turns in
trying to budge the president from his defense of his actions.
While he appeared to seethe at that detailed description from Ms.
Lewinsky's testimony, he held to his previous denial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will revert to my former statement,'' Clinton said, offering
a steely glare, but not following the prosecutor down that path.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not going to answer your trick questions,'' Clinton added
sharply when a prosecutor, his tone dripping with doubt, asked
whether the president was fulfilling his oath to ``tell the whole
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he fenced with questioners over the precise meaning of
such words as ``is'' and ``alone,'' Clinton's demeanor seemed to
strengthen and he complained that, from the first, his problem was
rooted in political enemies aiming ``a wrecking ball'' at him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're dealing with, in some ways, the most mysterious area of
human life,'' he said of sex, attempting to draw Rashomon-like
parallels with his problem and the clash of allegations seven years
ago between Anita Hill and Clarence Thomas as Thomas was appointed
to the Supreme Court. ``I'm doing the best I can to give you honest
answers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of the Hill-Thomas clash, Clinton said, ``I think they both
thought they were telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   But Starr prosecutors pressed him with the physical evidence of
his own predicament.
</P>
<P>
   `` Mr. President, if there is a semen stain belonging to you on
a dress of Ms. Lewinsky's, how would you explain that?'' asked
prosecutor Robert Bittman.
</P>
<P>
   In reply, the president, noting he had volunteered a DNA blood
test, declined to discuss any details. ``That's a question you
already know the answer to,'' he said. ``Not if, but you know
whether.''
</P>
<P>
   At the heart of Clinton's problem in facing Starr was his
six-hour deposition on Jan. 17 before lawyers for Ms. Jones who,
unbeknownst to the president, had heard detailed allegations about
Ms. Lewinsky from Ms. Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal in this deposition was to be truthful, but not
particularly helpful,'' Clinton told the grand jury when asked
about the initial denials of a Lewinsky relationship. ``I deplored
it,'' he said of the Jones suit. ``But I was determined to walk
through the mine field of this deposition without violating the
law. And I believe I did.''
</P>
<P>
   His questionners pressed him most particularly on his declining
to answer detailed questions about his argument that oral sex was
not part of sexual relations. A grand juror's question was relayed
to him: ``What legal basis are you declining to answer these
questions?''
</P>
<P>
   The president, who throughout the scandal has declined any
suggestion that he would resort to his Fifth Amendment right not to
answer incriminating questions, replied that he did not consider
himself required ``to say and do things that I don't think are
necessary, and that I think, frankly, go too far in trying to
criminalize my private life.''
</P>
<P>
   To another juror's question about oral sex, the president
underlined the distinction in the Jones suit listing several
erogenous zones in the definition of sex. ``Because that is,'' said
the president, ``if the deponent is the person who has oral sex
performed on him, then the contact is with _ not with anything on
that list, but with the lips of another person. It seems to be
self-evident that that's what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   In trying to build a case that the president abused his office,
prosecutors asked about his denying misbehavior to his key aides so
that they defended him daily in public until his qualified
recanting to the nation after his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony. He
replied that he tried to tell them a story ``that would be true,
even if misleading.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I said I have not had sex with her, as I define it,'' he said.
``So I said things that were true. They may have been misleading,
and if they were, I will have to take responsibility for it, and
I'm sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Of his meetings with Betty Currie, his White House secretary,
Clinton said he was only to trying to freshen his memory about Ms.
Lewinsky's visits, not illicitly coach Mrs. Currie in advance of
Starr's investigators. ``I wasn't trying to get her to say
something that wasn't so,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton did not hesitate to use his considerable skills as a
polished public speaker and lawyer, and even presented the argument
that history itself impelled him to be sparing in discussing the
lurid sexual details of his misbehavior that have consumed much of
the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say this to the grand jury: Put yourself in my
position,'' he said, noting how unusual the proceeding was and how
he had already suffered ``a breathtaking number of leaks'' from
prosecutors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I am right to answer all the questions about
perjury,'' he continued in his testimony, which was sealed as he
spoke. ``But not to say things which will be forever in the annals
of the United States because of this unprecedented videotape and
may be leaked at any time. I think it's a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   At various points, the Starr prosecutors appeared thoroughly
frustrated by the president's performance, particularly when they
sought to pin down his attorney's flat-out denial last January of
any sex with Ms. Lewinsky. ``It depends on what the meaning of the
word `is' means,'' he replied. ``If `is'' means `is and never has
been,' that's one thing. If it means, `there is none,' that was a
completely true statement.''
</P>
<P>
   The president made no apologies for his language. As he
concluded, he made sure to include a summary worthy of a career
campaign speaker, in which he said he had to ``contend with things
no previous president has ever had to contend with,'' including the
Jones lawsuit, now dismissed, and the lengthy, costly Starr inquiry
that has dogged his days of incumbency.
</P>
<P>
   ``And during this whole time, I have tried as best I could to
keep my mind on the job the American people gave me,'' he declared,
looking squarely into the grand jury camera.

NO CONTROVERSIES. NO DOUBTS. FLOJO WAS THAT GOOD.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was Florence Griffith Joyner's bane, as well as her blessing,
to be too good to be true.
</P>
<P>
   Too fast. Too sudden. Too stylish. Too ... FloJo.
</P>
<P>
   She didn't just break women's sprinting records in 1988. She
reinvented them.
</P>
<P>
   News of her death, yesterday in Mission Viejo, Calif., after a
history of heart trouble, unleashed a flood of memories.
</P>
<P>
   She was the most spectacular female athlete that some of us ever
saw in person. In some ways, with her lacy, one-legged outfits, she
was the most outrageous. Beneath the frills and the 9-inch
fingernails, she might also have been the most fearless.
</P>
<P>
   To put her 1988 season into perspective, you have to remember
that in the Olympic years between Wilma Rudolph and FloJo, American
women had been dominated _ no, intimidated _ in track and field by
their Eastern European counterparts. There had been a breakthrough,
of sorts, at the 1984 Games, but those sprinters ran against a
boycott-diluted field.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, at the Seoul Games in 1988, the new breed of U.S. women
athletes lined up against the East German and Soviet Olympians for
the first time. They had a new, confident look. They had a new
attitude. A FloJo attitude.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. women have not seemed intimidated since.
</P>
<P>
   Griffth Joyner was already well known to the U.S. track media
before that summer of '88. She had been a silver medalist at the
Los Angeles Olympics in '84. But that was supposed to be her
zenith, even though everyone knew that she had been training
earnestly under coach Bob Kersee.
</P>
<P>
   When she took her place in the starting blocks that July day at
the Olympic Trials in Indianapolis, she caused an immediate titter.
Though it was dreadfully humid and the Midwest was in the throes of
a record heat wave, as I recall FloJo was wearing an orange
bodysuit. A blast furnace breeze was blowing at her back.
</P>
<P>
   Until that first-round heat, Griffith Joyner's personal best in
the 100 meters had been 10.96 seconds. The world record was 10.76.
</P>
<P>
   But FloJo flew to a 10.60 clocking, the fastest that a woman had
ever run. The wind kept it from being considered a record.
</P>
<P>
   The next round of the 100-meter heats would both immortalize
FloJo and haunt her until her sudden death.
</P>
<P>
   Wearing another body-hugging outfit _ was it the silver one or
the white lace one? _ Griffith Joyner blurred across the finish
line in 10.49.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd at the Indy track stadium immediately turned to the
wind gauge. We all felt a warm breeze. But the sign board at the
gauge flashed ``0.0.''
</P>
<P>
   We blinked. In a sense, the entire world of track and field
blinked.
</P>
<P>
   The record was ratified, but the stories about the suspect wind
reading persist to this day.
</P>
<P>
   Questionable record. Questionable FloJo?
</P>
<P>
   Though Griffith Joyner went on to run three more legal 100-meter
times that summer of 10.70 or better, the suspicions prompted by
the 10.49 stirred the air of suspicion around FloJo.
</P>
<P>
   She went on to win three gold medals and a silver at the Seoul
Olympics. She lowered her 200-meter personal best from 21.96 to
21.34.
</P>
<P>
   Too much. Too fast. The Eastern Europeans were heard grumbling
about FloJo's sudden muscles, her sudden new look.
</P>
<P>
   Weary of the whispers, Bob Kersee leaned against a wall one day
in Seoul and pointed to the new first lady of track and field. She
had on red, white and blue fingernails. Her long dark hair and her
makeup were perfect.
</P>
<P>
   ``What about Florence,'' Kersee asked, ``would make you think
she wasn't all a woman?''
</P>
<P>
   It is inconceivable that Griffith Joyner would have escaped
those 1988 Games _ the Ben Johnson Olympics _ without being tested
several times for banned substances. But FloJo never failed a drug
test.
</P>
<P>
   Her only aberrant behavior, as far as we could tell, was that
she was talking too fast.
</P>
<P>
   The typical FloJo postrace remark, as I recall, went something
like, ``Ijustwantedtogetagoodstart, drivehardtothefinish and go for
the gold.''
</P>
<P>
   She went for the gold, all right. Her records from 1988 remain
Ruthian. No _ they may well last longer than that.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of her sudden death, suspicions are sure to
surface. Those who knew FloJo and who know Kersee would be shocked
if any of the whispers are proven true.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us would rather believe that Florence Griffith Joyner
was just a driven woman, a tireless worker, who found the right
coach at the right golden time _ and happened to have a wardrobe of
dazzling sprint suits to fit the occasion.
</P>
<P>
   Too good to be true? Can't be. I saw her myself.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As brain transplants go, the one that seems to have
taken place between Donna Karan and Helmut Lang is a most startling
swap. Ms. Karan, evidently, has become the bold experimenter and
Lang, the comforting, hard-nosed realist.
</P>
<P>
   Casting the final presentations of last week's fashion shows in
this way is of course a contrivance. But it best illustrates the
positions of these two influential designers. Wrapping up a week of
earlier showings for spring 1999, American designers, from marquee
names like Karan to unknowns like Diva Pittala, proved with
confident singular collections that they, too, can be
trend-setters.
</P>
<P>
   Karan has long given up any pretense of commerciality in her top
collection. In the 1980s, she was in lock step with her customers,
providing them with clothes that defined their career-driven lives
in grand style. Now, Karan is scurrying a bit too far ahead of her
muse.
</P>
<P>
   The underlying idea of the collection, a story of comfort
clothes, of languishing romance and spiritual recognition, rang
true. Ms. Karan has always come across as sincere. The ethereal
taffeta layers in shells and jackets over loose trousers, the
oversize cashmere sweaters in flattering makeup shades of pink,
peach and chamomile, appeared delicate and cocooning.
</P>
<P>
   But amid this intuitive and experimental collection, something
was also terribly wrong. So many of these clothes could be pictured
only in repose. The twisted skirt, an air-filled ballooning of
ankle-length taffeta, was both unwearable for most women and
unappealing, a deadly combination. Where Ms. Karan failed with this
adventurous show was to make her provocative ideas flattering.
</P>
<P>
   Experimental, contemplative fashion is not where Ms. Karan made
her name. Certainly no one has the audacity to insist she stay on
the horse she rode in on. There are, however, few designers who are
able to fuse commercial imperatives with creative ones. Most
designers are clustered at one of two extremes of fashion: the
unapologetic commercialist who will never set a trend, and the
creative wonders who effectively make fantasy clothes _ for if you
wear them, you will be laughed at for all the wrong reasons.
Because Ms. Karan has so often been one of the few successful
centrists, it is disappointing to see her move to anxx extreme.
</P>
<P>
   Lang eased comfortably into the area vacated by Karan, offering
innovative and wearable clothes. It is Lang's triumph that what
once seemed startling in his hands is now familiar. He clearly sees
his job as positing a credible way for worldly women to dress.
</P>
<P>
   His collection presented the dichotomy in today's woman _ her
necessary tough side, and her natural vulnerability. He captured
the opposites best with white feathery knee-length coats over
relaxed cotton trousers. And he went further with padded knees
borrowed from avant-garde Belgian designers and holster handbags
strapped on at the hip and around the leg. The look is sly, ominous
and sexy.
</P>
<P>
   There were delicate fuchsia tulle tank tops layered over
T-shirts _ a patchwork of stark white and deliberately kitsch
animal prints. Veiled, too, some with a pretty spray of accordion
pleats at the back, were white knee-length sheaths.
</P>
<P>
   For the record, Calvin Klein's collection looked nothing like
Lang's, to answer the obvious question hanging in the air like a
bubble about to burst. In the past. Klein has been accused of
copying Lang's work. On that score alone, one could have deemed his
show a success. But Klein is doing more these days than glancing to
his right and left. He is determined to be part of any significant
shift in fashion.
</P>
<P>
   In a wonderful and emphatic ode to American insouciance, he made
the dress _ shimmery, fluttery and windborne _ a refreshing key to
spring dressing. A richness of color, unusual for Klein, permeated
the collection. In one pivotal look, a silken jersey tent dress in
jewel green melted over one in fire red. He showed this on Kate
Moss; other models, in leather mules with low stiletto heels of
stainless steel, were swathed in guava green over mustard, or china
blue over guava green.
</P>
<P>
   Skirts, paired with scooped tanks or gossamer sweaters, sat
cheekily on the hips, held safe with wraps or large zippers that
darted across a hip or down one leg.
</P>
<P>
   But the vegetable hues that worked in languorous dresses did not
translate well to cotton suits. Their noncommittal shapes branded
them as an afterthought of a designer interestingly consumed with
femininity in dresses and skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Suits, in fact, have come to be unimportant on runways and in
many women's wardrobes. It was one of the strong points of Mark
Eisen's stellar collection that he made one actually want to wear a
suit again.
</P>
<P>
   It was hard not to feel a little smug at first over Eisen's
staging his show at Chelsea Piers, proven to be among the most
inconvenient sites for a fashion presentation. The show started
almost an hour late, and at least 30 percent of his front-row
audience did not make it.
</P>
<P>
   But Eisen did not allow himself to be dismissed. The suits were
one triumph in a significant show. What was so winning about this
collection was its effective mix of both Old World and preppy
fragments with New Age high-performance fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   The show vaguely invoked some classic fashion icon _ Babe Paley,
perhaps, or Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis vacationing on Capri. Yet,
it avoided the specificity of either of these references. Instead,
it was a modern interpretation of dressed-down luxury _ pretty and
practical with intriguing touches, like the use of water-repellant
silk.
</P>
<P>
   Eisen offered powder blue, sleeveless funnel-neck shirts with
waterproof silk pants softened at the hem with drawstrings; a
mackintosh coat, and a body-conscious, classic shirt and crisp,
relaxed trousers.
</P>
<P>
   With 25 collections on the roster last week, Americans looked
fresh, vibrant and viable as business people and as creators. There
was a welcome lack of slickness to the week, even from houses like
Searle, which in the past has tried for a trend-driven
commerciality. Vivienne TamTam, Han FengFeng, Sara Kozlowski for
Cake, Mary Jane Marcasiano and Ms. Pittala, who designs under the
label People Used to Dream About the Future, all presented lines in
the image of their own houses.
</P>
<P>
   Folkloric innocence in the form of smocking, apron dresses and
wool embroidery were a unifying theme throughout the collections,
which yielded important trends, although before the week began,
some fashion insiders predicted otherwise. Color is sure to be
important for the spring season, with designers as influential as
Lang, Ms. Karan and Klein endorsing it.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feng utilized bold hues to present a collection of soothing
femininity washed in aquamarine, sky blue and rose. A thoughtful
and meticulous designer, Ms. Feng gave simple jersey tops a subtle
drape on one side. She took striped fabric and made it dreamy with
large smocking, and her simple fluid evening gowns worked matte
against shine in black, gray or pale green.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Feng's fulsome showing contrasted with Ms. Tam's playful but
sparse collection. Perhaps some depth was lost in the punishing
crunch to have her collection ready for September rather than
November. In between the bead-fringed dresses, the
athletic-inspired paper jackets and the miniskirts enlivened with
turquoise zippers, one would have liked a suggestion for women at
work. It was not long ago that Ms. Tam was merely a promising
talent. She has grown in stature, and it is not too much to expect
a line reflective of her maturity.

ARIZONA GOP FORGETS FORBES; '96 PRIMARY WINNER GETS ZERO IN 2000
POLL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Steve Forbes made Arizona history in 1996 by spending $4 million
to win the state's first GOP presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   But a new poll suggests Arizona Republicans may have all but
forgotten about the wealthy publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Not a single Republican voter picked the wealthy publisher in
the 2000 presidential preference survey taken last month by Arizona
Chamber Info. Inc., a subsidiary of the Arizona Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it's a preposterous poll,'' Forbes said Monday
after his latest Arizona stop. ``This goes in the fiction
category.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have broad-based support for our views in Arizona and
elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Most Republicans in the statewide poll, 52 percent, were
undecided. But among those with an opinion, former vice
presidential candidate Jack Kemp came out on top of seven potential
GOP presidential candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Kemp had 18 percent, followed by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 14
percent; Sen. John McCain, 9 percent; former Vice President Dan
Quayle, 3 percent; Elizabeth Dole, 2 percent and Texas Gov. George
W. Bush, 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Pollsters read the names of seven potential GOP presidential
candidates, including Forbes', but not a single person polled chose
him.
</P>
<P>
   The survey of 231 Republicans had an error margin of plus or
minus 5.4 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   On the Democratic side, Vice President Al Gore was the choice of
48 percent of 213 Democrats polled, easily outpacing Nebraska Sen.
Bob Kerrey, 11 percent, and House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, 9
percent. The Rev. Jesse Jackson polled less than 1 percent, and 31
percent were undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Forbes, who spoke Monday to a health-care conference sponsored
by Rep. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., said the poll is ``fatally flawed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just a random selection (of Republicans) just doesn't cut
it,'' Forbes said, noting that the results have not been confirmed
by ``any other reputable survey, either in Arizona or elsewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Farrell Quinlan, the Arizona Chamber's vice president for
communications, said he, too, was shocked that Forbes did not even
register in the poll, but defended its accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what it says more is that it's a wide-open race,''
Quinlan said. ``The fact that someone like Steve Forbes didn't poll
well doesn't say he can't win it here again.''
</P>
<P>
   Forbes has become a fixture on Arizona's political landscape
since he won the state's 1996 GOP primary, stunning challengers Bob
Dole and Pat Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, he spoke at fund-raiser for the state GOP, after a
recent fund-raising appearance for Rep. J.D. Hayworth. In October,
he will keynote the Arizona Christian Coalition's annual
fund-raising dinner, and will appear before the Pima County
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Forbes called portions of President Clinton's
videotaped grand jury testimony ``absolutely devastating,'' and
predicted Clinton will not finish his second term.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could see them close the trap,'' Forbes said of the
prosecutors. ``That's why it's important the House hold hearings as
soon as possible, so this crisis can be resolved.''
</P>
<P>
   Once members begin looking at the ``whole array of abuses'' _
from travelgate to campaign finance _ Clinton ``won't survive,''
Forbes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they hold those hearings, and people get to see for
themselves the pattern and how long it's been going on, he will be
removed from office,'' Forbes predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Five minutes before the Senate (conviction) vote, he'll step
down.'' &QL;

FOR THE MOST PART, CLINTON KEPT HIS COMPOSURE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The nation Monday watched a lawyerly, tense and
combative President Clinton spar with prosecutors about his affair
with Monica Lewinsky as his videotaped grand jury testimony was
made public.
</P>
<P>
   All of the major television networks and cable news outlets
pre-empted their regular morning programming to carry just over 4
hours of Clinton being grilled on whether he lied under oath about
his sexual relationship with the former White House intern.
</P>
<P>
   During the Aug. 17 questioning at the White House, the
president's responses varied from evasiveness, at times quibbling
with his questioners over the definition of sex, to outright anger
at his investigators.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have made this the most important issue in America,''
Clinton told Starr's prosecutors at one point.
</P>
<P>
   He expressed resentment when the questioning continually
returned to his denials of sex with Lewinsky in a sworn deposition
from the Paula Jones sexual harassment case, vehemently denouncing
the lawsuit as politically motivated.
</P>
<P>
   And Clinton disputed the simplest premises raised by
prosecutors, such as what it meant to be alone with Lewinsky in the
Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   But the president generally maintained his composure and held
his own during the lengthy session. His testimony produced few
bombshells, in part because so many details had been included in
Starr's own report to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The tape was just part of a massive release of evidence by the
House Judiciary Committee. Lawmakers and the media pored over 3,183
pages of information that contained more explicit details from
Lewinsky about her affair with the president, including photos of
her semen-stained dress.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton, trying to escape the storm of scandal, was in
New York addressing the United Nations, where he was greeted by a
standing ovation.
</P>
<P>
   The White House issued a statement condemning the release of the
new material, saying that congressional Republicans merely wanted
to rehash salacious details of an affair the president had already
admitted was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rank partisanship that led to the wholesale release of
these materials, most of which are irrelevant, is regrettable,''
the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans, however, have defended the public's right to
view a tape they contend may show the president committed
impeachable offenses, such as perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody has a license to lie,'' said Rep. James Sensenbrenner,
R-Wis., a member of the Judiciary Committee, which would hold
impeachment hearings.
</P>
<P>
   It has been clear in recent days that House Republicans have
been paving the way for an inquiry that could be approved before
they leave for fall recess in October. They view the videotaped
testimony as helpful in building their case.
</P>
<P>
   House Democrats, however, countered that there was nothing new
on the tape. Rep. Gene Green, D-Texas, said after viewing the
testimony that he could not support an impeachment inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's turned into a political battle instead of a
constitutional battle,'' he said. Republicans, Green said, were
``more concerned about winning the November elections and picking
up seats than removing the president based on his wrongdoing.''
</P>
<P>
   GOP leaders have voiced optimism that Clinton's problems will
boost their candidates' chances in the upcoming elections. But the
release of the videotape was not a risk-free proposition for
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls showed that a majority of Americans did not
want the videotape aired, particularly if it contained a rehash of
the intimate details already included in Starr's report that was
released last week.
</P>
<P>
   But the event, which has dominated news programs for days,
proved almost anti-climactic as the testimony shed little new
information about the affair.
</P>
<P>
   Although the questioning showed Clinton occasionally becoming
agitated and angry, there were no remarkable outbursts. The
president blunted the prosecutors' ability to question him by
giving lengthy responses that used up much of the agreed-upon time.
</P>
<P>
   While the videotaped testimony may have not added much new, it
does show a sometimes evasive president who makes fine legal
distinctions and pleads a loss of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton repeatedly refused to agree to prosecutors' suggestion
that he had committed perjury by testifying that he did not have
sex with Lewinsky in the Jones deposition.
</P>
<P>
   While acknowledging he had an improper relationship, Clinton
argued that he did not believe oral sex fit under the definition of
sexual relations offered by Jones' lawyers, which include touching
a person's genitals for the purpose of arousal.
</P>
<P>
   In response to questions from jurors about the distinction,
Clinton said, ``I'll bet the grand jury, if they were talking about
people they know and said they had a sexual relationship together,
they meant they were sleeping together; they meant they were having
intercourse together.''
</P>
<P>
   On another issue Clinton was asked why he did not turn over to
Jones' lawyers personal letters from Kathleen Willey, who has
accused the president of intimately touching her.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton responded that Jones' lawyers had asked for personal
rather than White House correspondence. His lawyers considered the
Willey letters White House correspondence.
</P>
<P>
   The president and prosecutors sparred over chronology of events.
Clinton insisted that his top adviser Bruce Lindsay had initially
told him that Lewinsky had been subpoenaed by Jones' lawyers.
Prosecutors, however, said it was his friend Vernon Jordan, who
eventually tried to help Lewinsky get a job.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Clinton also blamed the demands on the presidency
and Starr's investigation for hampering what he admitted had been a
good memory.
</P>
<P>
   The president's anger at those investigating his conduct came
through during the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   Explaining why he did not fully respond to Jones' lawyers during
his deposition, he angrily retorted he did not want to help people
he believed were out to hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I deplored what they were doing. I deplored the innocent
people they were tormenting and traumatizing. I deplored their
illegal leaking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   His ire at the independent counsel was also apparent, as he
sniped that ``we have seen this four-year $40 million investigation
come down to parsing the definition of sex.''
</P>
<P>
   The president appeared sympathetic to Lewinsky, even though he
said several times that he had tried to break off the relationship
because he knew it was wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's basically a good girl,'' he told prosecutors. ``She's a
good young women with a good heart and a good mind. I think she is
burdened by some unfortunate conditions of her upbringing.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton also said there was nothing improper about the gifts
that he had given Lewinsky over the years. The president said he
had given gifts to many people over the years.
</P>
<P>
   Starr has claimed that Clinton's secretary Betty Currie's
efforts to retrieve gifts subpoened by Jones' lawyers may have
amounted to obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
   During the session, the president sat behind his desk in the
White House as he fielded questioning from a team of seven lawyers
from the independent counsel's office. Starr only asked a few
questions, leaving the grilling largely to his deputies. Three
lawyers for the president were also in the room
</P>
<P>
   During the questioning the president reached often for a glass
of water, regularly cleared his voice and asked for a number of
breaks.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton said he could not remember all of the details of
his relationship with Lewinsky, the former intern's testimony is
peppered with detail.
</P>
<P>
   In the newly released material, Lewinsky, in three sessions with
prosecutors, details the 10 sexual encounters she had with Clinton
at the White House as well as her conversations with Clinton friend
Jordan about getting a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
   She also aimed some of her most vitriolic commentary at Linda
Tripp, her former colleague at the Pentagon who tipped off Starr
about her affair.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp taped her conversations with Lewinsky regarding the
president and then turned them over to the independent counsel.
Lewinsky testified that it was Tripp who urged her to save the blue
dress with semen stains that she later turned over to the
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate Linda Tripp,'' she told jurors.

WANNSTEDT CAN COACH, BUT IS HE CUT OUT TO BE A HEAD COACH?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By MIKE FISHER 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   I like Dave Wannstedt.
</P>
<P>
   I know he's devoted to Catholicism, sometimes going to church
every morning. I know he's devoted to family, fighting the
scheduling demands of an NFL coach to sneak away when possible for
a romantic dinner with his wife, or to see one of his daughters
perform in a play or a volleyball game. I know he's devoted to his
friends, so much so that his warmth urges uncharacteristic kindness
from all of them, even Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   I like Dave Wannstedt. But I'm not sure he's cut out for this.
</P>
<P>
   I've got a million more things to learn about pro football. But
so much of the knowledge I do have comes from the generous
teachings of Wannstedt, so giving during his 1989-92
defensive-coordinator stint in Dallas and continuously so since he
took the Chicago Bears' top job.
</P>
<P>
   I saw first-hand Joel Collier's work in Denver. I saw first-hand
George Seifert's work in San Francisco. I saw first-hand Butch
Davis and Dave Campo's work in Dallas. I have some familiarity with
what Buddy Ryan did with the old Vikings and Bears, with what
Richie Petitbon did with the Redskins, with what Dom Capers did
with the Steelers, with what Greg Robinson is doing with the
Broncos, with what John Fox is doing now with the Giants, with what
Green Bay's Fritz Shurmur has done since forever.
</P>
<P>
   And Dave Wannstedt is the best defensive coordinator I've ever
seen.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, the X's-and-O's stuff? Even the worst of 'em have that
mastered. But Wannstedt had more. He was an old offensive lineman,
so he was a smart guy. He was a Jimmy protege, so he learned the
art of quick calculation. He was a native Pittsburgher, so he was a
tough guy. He was a great friend, a great teacher, an intimidating
presence, a leader of men.
</P>
<P>
   On those great Cowboys teams, Wannstedt never begged oddballs
Charles Haley and James Washington to perform. He just ordered them
to, and they did. In those days, Wannstedt had a magic touch on
draft day. Look it up: Those teas rarely missed on the important
defensive puzzle pieces, linemen and cornerbacks. Some of that was
Dave.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear: If Jimmy Johnson was king, Dave Wannstedt was the
heir to the throne.
</P>
<P>
   It's not so clear now: In 1992, the Pittsburgh Steelers were
shopping for a replacement for Chuck Noll. They interviewed three
finalists, Kevin Gilbride, and local boys Wannstedt and Bill
Cowher. Cowher got the Steelers; Wannstedt got the Bears the next
season.
</P>
<P>
   The two faced off a week ago. Cowher's Steelers won, and even
with Pittsburgh's disappointing loss to Miami on Sunday, his career
mark is 66-33, and his club is marching to a probable sixth playoff
berth in six years. Meanwhile, Wannstedt has made the playoffs
once. And even if you want to give him credit for keeping his 0-3
Bears in games this year against powerhouses Jacksonville,
Pittsburgh and Tampa Bay, you cannot ignore his career mark of
36-47.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our three highest-paid players last year were (Alonzo)
Spellman, (Bryan) Cox and Rick Mirer, and none of them is on the
team (this year),'' Wannstedt says. ``We missed on way too many
draft picks. We've made mistakes in the personnel area and free
agency. ... That kind of sums up why we're backed into a corner.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittsburgh hired, by reputation and record, one of the best head
coaches in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Chicago hired, by reputation and record, well. ... the best
defensive coordinator I've ever seen. &QL; 
QUOTABLE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still at a point where I don't even know what I don't
know.'' _ Panthers rookie defensive lineman Jason Peter. &QL; 
THE BUZZ &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In large part due to that Week 1, game-winning 96-yard touchdown
run by Garrison Hearst in overtime to beat the Jets, the 49ers are
averaging 530 yards per game on offense. But the run has more
significance. ``NFL Films'' boss Steve Sabol, whose entire life is
to know such things, says Hearst's effort is ``the greatest run
ever.'' ... Somebody suggests to Saints linebackers coach Zaven
Yarallan that his troops were a bit thin, that he could use another
linebacker. Responds Yarallan: ``I'm not a chicken. I can't hatch
one.'' But something's going right in New Orleans: This is only the
third time in the club's 31-year history the Saints have started
2-0. ... Before this season, the 2-0 Falcons hadn't won a September
game since 1995. ... Beware, struggling kickers: Every NFL team has
the phone number of temporarily unemployed Cary Blanchard. ... In
my review of running backs taken ahead of Denver sixth-rounder
Terrell Davis in the '95 draft, I left off the immortal Patriots
fifth-rounder Dino Philyaw. Sorry. How could I forget?.

U.S. AND ALLIES INCREASE PRESSURE ON SERBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By STEVEN LEE MYERS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The United States and NATO allies stepped up
pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic of Yugoslavia Monday to
end his military crackdown against separatists in Kosovo. And
officials in Washington and Europe warned that the worsening plight
of refugees in the province was increasing the possibility of NATO
intervention.
</P>
<P>
   At the United Nations, Britain and France pushed the Security
Council to adopt a resolution calling for a cease-fire in the
conflict, which has driven an estimated 250,000 people from their
homes in the predominantly ethnic Albanian province.
</P>
<P>
   The draft resolution would invoke the chapter of the U.N.
Charter that makes compliance mandatory, raising the specter of
military force, although the resolution does not specifically
threaten it. Nonetheless, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain said
the international community had to prevent a disaster ``by any
means necessary.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Our patience with broken promises and phony assurances is
exhausted,'' Blair said in a speech to the General Assembly that
sharply criticized Milosevic's security forces. ``Continuation of
military repression will inevitably lead to a new kind of
response.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States has maintained that NATO does not need
authorization from the United Nations to intervene in Yugoslavia,
and the president's national security adviser, Sandy Berger,
reiterated that Monday. But administration officials said Monday
that the resolution reflected an emerging consensus among the NATO
alliance that only military strikes would persuade Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's military commanders have already drawn up plans for a
range of military strikes, officials said. The options range from a
limited barrage of cruise missiles, like the U.S. attacks in
Afghanistan and Sudan last month, to a series of intensifying
aerial bombardments that would begin with attacks on military
targets in Kosovo and, depending on how Milosevic responds, would
lead to strikes throughout Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   NATO's commanders have informally begun asking members what
forces they are willing to contribute to a military strike, an
administration official said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Although the NATO allies have not yet reached agreement on the
use of force, the plans will be a center of debate when Secretary
of Defense William Cohen and other defense ministers from NATO's 16
members meet in Portugal this week. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright is also expected to raise the issue in a series of
meetings in New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think the time has run out on diplomacy,'' the
official said. As for a decision to use force, the official added,
``It's all political will at this point.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Other than dispatching warplanes for a military exercise along
Albania's border with Yugoslavia in June, the Pentagon and many
NATO allies have resisted using force in what amounts to a civil
war between Serbian forces and ethnic Albanians fighting for
Kosovo's independence.
</P>
<P>
   But after showing signs of restraint when the conflict began in
February, the Serbian forces intensified their campaign over the
summer and, in recent weeks, began shelling entire villages, not
just rebel positions, forcing civilians to flee. With winter
approaching, international agencies worry that tens of thousands of
refugees without food or shelter could face death.
</P>
<P>
   A senior NATO official said Monday that the alliance had badly
misread the situation over the summer, making its early warnings
about force appear hollow as Milosevic's forces routed rebel forces
and then attacked civilians with impunity.
</P>
<P>
   There is still no agreement on using force, but that official
and others in Washington said sentiments within the alliance had
clearly shifted in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has stepped up diplomatic efforts to forge a
resolution that would give Kosovo back some of the autonomy
Milosevic stripped from the province in 1989. So far diplomatic
efforts have failed.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. envoy, Christopher Hill, met with Milosevic in Belgrade
again Monday, but afterward Milosevic insisted that there was no
``humanitarian catastrophe'' in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   ``The phrase `humanitarian catastrophe' does not correspond to
reality and is only a pretext to keep the pressure on Serbia and
Yugoslavia,'' he said in a statement released by his government.

HURRICANE BUFFETS PUERTO RICO AND THE U.S. VIRGIN ISLANDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS for new info, and to refine)   (af)  
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, P.R. _ Still dangerous but with its strength somewhat
diminished, Hurricane Georges swept into Puerto Rico and the U.S.
Virgin Islands today after leaving a trail of destruction in the
smaller islands of the northeastern Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
   The eye of the storm, which the National Hurricane Center in
Miami has classified as the most powerful and menacing of the
season, was just south of San Juan on Monday evening, and The
Associated Press reported that three people were killed when the
roof of their home collapsed in the San Juan suburb of Bayamon.
</P>
<P>
   Since the weekend, the storm has been on a course that would
take it diagonally across the full length of Puerto Rico for a
period of nearly 24 hours. It has weakened somewhat since Sunday
morning, when it had maximum sustained winds of 150 miles per hour,
almost enough to make it a Category 5 storm, the most dangerous on
the Saffir-Simpson scale used to rank hurricanes.
</P>
<P>
   By Monday afternoon, its peak winds had diminished to 110 mph
with occasional gusts of up to 150 mph, making it a Category 2
storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other day we were comparing this one to Hurricane Hugo,
but it has lost a bit of steam now and will likely lose a little
more as it crosses Puerto Rico,'' said Brian Maher, a forecaster at
the National Hurricane Center. ``It won't have a chance to
intensify again until it gets away from the islands and out over
open water again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless the authorities here and in the Virgin Islands
continued to warn residents to remain indoors or, if their homes
are in coastal areas or made of flimsy material, to move to
shelters in schools and churches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect there is going to be major damage, and some families
are going to have difficult days to come,'' Gov. Pedro Rossello
cautioned at midday as the first strong winds and rain were
beginning to be felt here.
</P>
<P>
   In the Virgin Islands, Gov. Roy Schneider had already imposed an
8 p.m. curfew and, like Rossello, asked President Clinton in
advance to declare a federal state of emergency so that disaster
relief could flow more rapidly once the storm passed. Advance teams
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the American Red
Cross were in place in both American territories, and FEMA had
organized a 62-member search-and-rescue team in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Monday afternoon, Rossello said that both
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. George Pataki had called him and
offered New York's help in any cleanup and reconstruction. Puerto
Ricans living in the continental United States have also inquired
about providing assistance, he said, adding that a decision whether
the aid will be needed would be made only after he had assessed the
damage.
</P>
<P>
   Across the Leeward Islands, which suffered a direct hit by the
storm on Sunday night and early Monday, that process was already
under way. Initial reports said the islands hit the hardest
appeared to be Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, both
independent countries; the British colony of Montserrat, and the
French overseas territory of Guadeloupe.
</P>
<P>
   On all those islands, the authorities reported that buildings
had been ripped apart and power lines damaged. But as of
midafternoon, no fatalities had been reported anywhere along the
storm's west-northwesterly path.
</P>
<P>
   After traversing Puerto Rico, the storm is expected to hit the
northern coast of the Dominican Republic and Haiti, where hurricane
warnings are already in effect.
</P>
<P>
   Once the storm reaches the eastern tip of Cuba, however, its
course becomes less predictable. It is too early, they say, for
anyone's guard to be lowered, even along the United States' Gulf
Coast.

AN UPHILL CLIMB, WITH ANKLE WEIGHTS 
IN NORTH CAROLINA, THE NAME GAME 
AN ACE BEATS A JACK ANY DAY
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By B. Drummond Ayres Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., has known almost from the day she
took office that winning a second term would not be easy. As one of
the most liberal Democrats on Capitol Hill, she is a polarizing
figure who attracts critics more easily than most politicians, and
her resulting ``negatives'' in the polls have always been high.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with Election Day just six weeks off, her already tough
battle against her Republican opponent, state Treasurer Matt Fong,
is looking even more difficult.
</P>
<P>
   A new poll, conducted by The Los Angeles Times, found her
leading Fong by roughly eight points among registered voters _ at
first glance, a fairly comfortable edge. But when the poll was
narrowed to cover only registered voters ``likely'' to vote, Fong
took a five-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The implication: Ms. Boxer must find some way to energize her
supporters to turn out in greater numbers. That will be no easy
task in a year in which primary voting in general has been near
record lows and, looking toward November, increasing numbers of
Democrats seem more and more dispirited and many Republicans seem
poised to dash to the nearest voting booth.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, Ms. Boxer, like many Democrats, has been
damaged somewhat by fallout from President Clinton's relationship
with Monica Lewinsky. About one in seven voters in the Times poll
said the president's behavior had made them more likely to vote,
and two-thirds of that group said they intended to vote for Fong.
</P>
<P>
   The poll also found that Boxer had compounded the damage by not
being as critical of the president's behavior as many voters would
like. About a third of the respondents said they were less likely
to vote for her because of her low-key response.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, one of the most extensive to date that looks closely
at the possible effect of Clinton-Lewinsky on fall voting, was
taken last week. It covered more than 1,600 Californians, almost
1,300 of them registered voters, and has a margin of error of plus
or minus three percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   In North Carolina, The Name Game
</P>
<P>
   What's in a name?
</P>
<P>
   In politics, name recognition can sometimes be the difference
between winning and losing. And in North Carolina, the pundits are
saying that that explains in good part why Democratic voters
nominated Jim Martin to represent their party this fall in a
contest for a seat on the state Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   But wait. In the Tar Heel State, there's Jim Martin and then
there's Jim Martin.
</P>
<P>
   The former _ the nominee Jim Martin _ is a state district judge
from the little crossroads town of Ayden. He came out of political
nowhere in May to trounce the much better known candidate in the
primary, Judge Joe John of the state Court of Appeals. Before that,
the only consequential headlines Martin had made resulted from
being reprimanded several times by higher courts for failing to
follow various legal procedures.
</P>
<P>
   The latter Jim Martin is the former (no word play intended)
two-term Republican governor. He says voters mistakenly thought
they were voting for him when they went to the primary polls four
months ago and voted for Judge Martin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure they did,'' the judge agrees with Cheshire cat candor.
</P>
<P>
   How about those Judge Jim Martin election placards that were
plastered about during the primary campaign, the ones that looked a
lot like the signs that once helped re-elect Gov. Jim Martin? Mere
coincidence?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, I don't know,'' Judge Martin told The News &AMP; Observer in
Raleigh. ``I just picked a color.''
</P>
<P>
   The former governor worries that if voters could vote for the
wrong Jim Martin once, they could do it twice. And the next time,
he says, they might end up putting a Democrat on the Supreme Court
rather than just nominating one to run for the job.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, he called on Republican leaders around the
state, including state House Majority Leader N. Leo Daughtry, to do
all possible to clear up the Martin confusion, lest the Republican
candidate in the fall be overwhelmed. That would be Mark Martin, no
relation to either Jim but a former aide to the governor and now a
member of the state Court of Appeals.
</P>
<P>
   Daughtry forthwith sent out a fund-raising letter that included
a reprint of a story in the current Reader's Digest. The story
ranks Judge Martin as one of America's worst judges, a ranking he
is quoted as saying ignores his record of ``perfect judgeship.''
</P>
<P>
   Since that mailing, a number of the state's leading Democrats,
including two former state party chairman, have backed away from
Judge Martin. And some have begun raising money for Mark Martin.
</P>
<P>
   An Ace Beats A Jack Any Day
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Democrats nominated John Cox, a former professor
and management consultant, to take on Rep. Matt Salmon, the
two-term Republican who represents Arizona's First District. But it
was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   Cox, who had no primary opposition, died two days before voting
took place. The 8,000 votes he won came mainly from voters unaware
that he had succumbed to a stroke only hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, Democratic leaders from the district, which covers
much of the eastern edge of Phoenix, convened to pick a
replacement, as provided for by the state Constitution. Three
candidates stepped forward and the balloting began.
</P>
<P>
   In the first round, none of the candidates got a majority but
the one who came in third was eliminated. In the second round,
there was a tie. Same for the third round.
</P>
<P>
   That meant, under the state Constitution, that a game of chance
_ any game of chance _ would be used to settle the issue. The
candidates, David Mendoza, a labor lobbyist, and Victor Aronow, a
teacher, settled on a hand of five-card stud.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza won, ace of clubs high to Aronow's jack of spades.
</P>
<P>
   He'll likely need another ace, perhaps one up his sleeve, come
November. The First is rated a solid Republican district.

OFFICIALS SEE RACIAL MOTIVE IN AN ASSAULT 
</HEADLINE>
  (js)

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Offering fresh details about what they described as a
bias attack, law enforcement officials said Monday that a
19-year-old man who was severely beaten Sunday evening in South
Ozone Park, Queens, had been singled out by residents who wanted to
beat up an Indian.
</P>
<P>
   The man, Rishi Maharaj, remained in Jamaica Hospital Medical
Center Monday with blunt-trauma injuries to the head. A hospital
spokeswoman said his condition had been upgraded to stable.
</P>
<P>
   The police said three men beat him senseless with baseball bats
while he was walking from his uncle's house on 114th Street with
two of his cousins. According to investigators, one of the three
suspects instigated the attack when he proposed, using an
expletive, to set upon ``the Indians.''
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj was born in the United States. His family, of Indian
descent, is from Trinidad, said a third cousin of the victim. The
cousin, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said that during
the assault, the attackers complained about Indians moving into
their neighborhood and causing it to decline.
</P>
<P>
   She described Maharaj as a slight man who does not pick fights.
``He just didn't deserve this,'' she said. ``He is not a bully. He
is the very opposite of a bully.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack took place in front of the homes of two of the
suspects, Luis Amorim, 22, and Nuno Martins, 19. Police said the
two men, along with a third, Peter DeMarco, 19, who lives nearby,
had been drinking when they spotted Maharaj, who lives about a mile
away on the border of Ozone Park and Richmond Hill, and his two
female cousins, ages 19 and 22, coming up the street.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said the suspects would be charged
Tuesday with assault, which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years
in prison. Prosecutors were also contemplating attempted-murder
charges.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Richard Brown of Queens called the crime
racially motivated. ``In my view, this was an unprovoked and
vicious attack on a defenseless young man because of his
ethnicity,'' he said. ``It is to be condemned.''
</P>
<P>
   The attack comes at a time when South Ozone Park and surrounding
communities have witnessed a substantial influx of Indians from
Trinidad and Guyana. According to City Planning Department figures,
the adjacent neighborhood of Richmond Hill now has the highest
concentration of Guyanese, mostly those of Indian descent, among
all city neighborhoods, while South Ozone Park has also seen a
steady trickle of Indo-Caribbean immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions in both middle-class neighborhoods, which are dotted
with detached houses with landscaped lawns and driveways, usually
involve disputes over the illegal conversions of single-family
homes. Racial and ethnic attacks are rare, said Dolly Hassan, a
lawyer for Liberty Immigration Services, a nonprofit group in
Richmond Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's always going to be people when they see newcomers
coming in, they're going to feel invaded,'' Ms. Hassan said. ``So
I'm not really surprised. But I am a bit taken aback.''
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj's relatives said they were stunned by the attack. ``We
have lived here for three years and we have never had a problem,''
said his cousin, who lives in South Ozone Park but did not witness
the attack.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The incident began about 9:30 p.m. Sunday when Maharaj left the
home of an uncle, Prakash Gopee, according to law enforcement
officials. With his two cousins, Maharaj walked down 114th Street
toward 150th Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   On the way, Maharaj made a comment about a plane that appeared
to be flying unusually close to the ground, the authorities said.
The three suspects were sitting on a stoop several houses down, and
one warned Maharaj to keep his voice down because he might wake up
the suspect's mother, law enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Maharaj apologized, but the three suspects got up, ran toward
Maharaj and started punching, kicking and beating him with two
baseball bats, the authorities said. Maharaj's two cousins ran back
to Gopee's house to get help.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said Maharaj continued to apologize to
his attackers until he lost consciousness. After being told of the
beating, Gopee ran out of his house with a machete in an attempt to
help his nephew. But the suspects wrestled the machete away and
proceeded to punch and kick Gopee, the authorities said. A relative
said Gopee, 49, suffered bruises on his head.
</P>
<P>
   The police were not able to say on Monday how many bias attacks
have been recorded in South Ozone Park. But the beating occurred
about six blocks from the site where a black man was fatally beaten
by a group of white men in 1992. And in neighboring Howard Beach,
another black man, Michael Griffith, was chased to his death in
1986 by a group of teen-agers, some from South Ozone Park, shouting
racial epithets.

LAWYERS VIEW DUEL BETWEEN CLINTON, INTERROGATORS WITH PROFESSIONAL
EYES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By WILLIAM HERMANN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Phoenix-area lawyers said Monday that they viewed the televised
give-and-take between President Clinton and his interrogators with
professional interest.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned by anger and disgust.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Debus said it made him sick.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a registered Republican for 40 years, and I'll never
give them another nickel,'' the prominent criminal attorney said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole interrogation wasn't intended to get information for
Congress to determine whether to impeach or censor. The entire
purpose was to embarrass the president.''
</P>
<P>
   Debus noted that when the president refused to answer
interrogators' questions about sexual encounters with White House
intern Monica Lewinsky, ``They didn't follow up as they could have.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had thought they were on proper ground, all they do is
say `We're going to continue this until we get these questions
answered.' ''
</P>
<P>
   In a proper grand jury setting, he said, prosecutors could have
said Clinton was in contempt of court because he was not answering
the questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they knew their questions weren't relevant or material and
were meant only to embarrass the man,'' Debus said. ``The proof of
that is they didn't try to force him to answer the questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Ex-Arizona Attorney General Bob Corbin said he was disgusted by
Clinton's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good Lord, he was so evasive,'' Corbin said. ``If he'd have
been in a court of law, he never could have gotten away with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they have him in a box. If he admits to aspects of the
sexual relations thing, then he admits to committing perjury, and
that's a felony.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect the office of the presidency, but I don't respect
this man. He is a disgrace to the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   William French, who was called upon 10 years ago by Arizona
legislators to prosecute then-Gov. Evan Mecham, said he thought
``the president was understandably argumentative and evasive at
times.''
</P>
<P>
   French said the president's evasions were understandable
because, ``the questions were in such depth, such detail, they were
extremely difficult to address.''
</P>
<P>
   French said the testimony and grilling left him feeling angry.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `This is so humiliating!' And I think this could
come back to haunt the prosecutors,'' he said. ``There was an
overkill. They were rubbing his nose in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Maricopa County Attorney Rick Romley thought Clinton's
performance ``wasn't as bad as it was portrayed by the press; there
was no loss of temper.''
</P>
<P>
   Romley felt prosecutors didn't always follow up their questions
to good effect: ``It was evident some doors were open, but they
didn't follow up and tie him down.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Romley said, ``The president was very evasive.''
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix defense attorney Gary Klahr said Clinton ``did better
than you'd expect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He smiled and generally performed well _ LBJ would have gotten
angry,'' Klahr said.
</P>
<P>
   But Clinton's performance wasn't quite good enough, Klahr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid the sizzle was better than the steak,'' he said.
``Clinton obviously was splitting hairs in respect to events, and
he was very evasive. He came close to committing perjury. In fact,
I think he did commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton's story has all sorts of holes in it. The only way you
can believe him is if you can believe he really doesn't remember
things.
</P>
<P>
   ``And that's pretty hard to accept.'' &QL;

FROM SIBERIA WITH JEWELS  
 THE OLIVE &AMP; BETTE'S CATALOG

   Jewelry From a Model
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a child, Irina Pantaeva used to accompany her
uncle, a geologist, on rock-hunting trips in their native Siberia.
``I grew up playing with precious stones,'' said Ms. Pantaeva, a
model, whose Asian beauty has taken her to the runways.
</P>
<P>
   With hands accustomed to the feel of diamonds, Ms. Pantaeva has
begun her own jewelry collection, called Irina. The line, which is
represented by Apropo, had its public coming-out party last Friday
at Mary Jane Marcasiano's fashion show, where Ms. Pantaeva's simple
organic earrings were a fitting flourish to relaxed sporty clothes.
</P>
<P>
   Another example of Ms. Pantaeva's jewelry was on her finger. Her
wedding band _ emeralds and 18-karat gold in the form of a dragon _
inspired the line. Her husband, Roland Levin, is her business
partner.
</P>
<P>
   The line, from $500 for earrings to $8,000 for a necklace, has
four groups: the dragon, the lotus, the elements, and snowflakes
and icicles. ``I wanted to create jewelry that will be worn like
amulets,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pantaeva was absent from the runways last week. She was on
tour promoting her memoir, ``Siberian Dream,'' published by Avon
Books. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   An Of-the-Minute Catalog
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Several companies are carving out a youthful area in
fashion, the edges of which can be traced by designer-driven,
reasonably priced clothes. And companies quick enough to scope out
the scene, like Olive &AMP; Bette's, Club Monaco, Tocca and Scoop, seem
to be expanding nicely.
</P>
<P>
   On the heels of its latest store opening last month, at 1070
Madison Avenue (81st Street), Olive &AMP; Bette's has introduced a
catalog for the fall. With its focus on less prominent designers
and of-the-minute fashion, there's simply no other book like it.
</P>
<P>
   By nature, catalogs tend to cater to older customers or feature
traditional clothing. What's the fashionista in search of fast,
sophisticated clothes to do? In these pages, she will find a
cashmere turtleneck for $200, Jussara Lee's pleated skirt for $104
and Frou's tartan bag for $196. There are purple Birkenstocks, Free
People's ankle-length skirt, athletic Daryl K pants and, yes, cargo
pants.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are hungry for fashion,'' said Stacey Pecor, the owner
of the three Olive &AMP; Bette's stores (one in Vermont and one at
Columbus Avenue and 72nd Street) and an owner with Karen Greenberg
of the catalog. The book was originally conceived with a test
catalog in March, to serve women far from the fashion hubs. But in
the three weeks during which the fall catalog has been out, most
orders have come in from Dallas and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Urban women, too, are probably grateful for a quick, edited
buying experience that reflects their sensibilities. ``We summarize
what you need,'' Ms. Pecor said.
</P>
<P>
   The Mercedes-Benz Look
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Does the appropriation of fashion to sell everything
from cars to liquor enhance fashion or cheapen it? It's a question
that has arisen as a proliferation of nonfashion companies begin
fashion lines. The latest is Mercedes-Benz. Prestigious, sure, but
are its offerings fashion?
</P>
<P>
   ``The car has always been something of a fashion statement,''
insisted Wade Hubbard, who as the general manager for service,
parts and accessories is in charge of the development of a Mercedes
clothing line.
</P>
<P>
   Like most car brands, Mercedes has always sold promotional
goods, like T-shirts with its logo. Beginning in October, it will
sell products in its showrooms and catalogs that complement each of
its four car categories: golf wear, outerwear, leather wallets and
sportswear. ``Each car has a personality, and we wanted to create a
line of accessories around that,'' Hubbard said.
</P>
<P>
   The truth is it's hardly fashion that companies like
Mercedes-Benz or Johnnie Walker, which recently started a clothing
line, are selling. What they are bent on is brand extension. And
which industry knows more about that than fashion?

   UNITED NATIONS _ Following is an excerpt from remarks made at
the General Assembly on Monday by President Nelson Mandela of South
Africa, as part of what he termed a valedictory address.
</P>
<P>
   This is probably the last time I will have the honor to stand at
this podium to address the General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
   Born as the First World War came to a close and departing from
public life as the world marks half a century of the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights, I have reached that part of the long
walk when the opportunity is granted, as it should be to all men
and women, to retire to some rest and tranquillity in the village
of my birth.
</P>
<P>
   As I sit in Qunu and grow as ancient as its hills, I will
continue to entertain the hope that there has emerged a cadre of
leaders in my own country and region, on my continent and in the
world, which will not allow that any should be denied their freedom
as we were; that any should be turned into refugees as we were;
that any should be condemned to go hungry as we were; that any
should be stripped of their human dignity as we were.
</P>
<P>
   I will continue to hope that Africa's renaissance will strike
deep roots and blossom forever, without regard to the changing
seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Were all these hopes to translate into a realizable dream and
not a nightmare to torment the soul of the aged, then will I,
indeed, have peace and tranquillity.
</P>
<P>
   Then would history and the billions throughout the world
proclaim that it was right that we dreamed and that we toiled to
give life to a workable dream.

ARIZONA REP. HAYWORTH SAYS CLINTON VIDEO WILL VALUABLE TOOL FOR LAW
STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By HAL MATTERN AND CHRIS MOESER  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   President Clinton's videotaped testimony wasn't exactly must-see
TV for Arizona's congressional delegation Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the state's six congressmen and two senators were
reportedly traveling or too busy to catch the four hours of
testimony on television.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, R-Ariz., the one congressman who did find
time to watch most of the testimony, acknowledged that the tape
wasn't a ``smoking gun'' that would prove that Clinton committed
perjury.
</P>
<P>
   But Hayworth said the video would provide great material for law
students on a witness ``who does anything and everything to avoid''
telling the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a masterpiece of prevarication,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz., who was attending meetings most of the
day in his southern Arizona district, said he didn't think it was
necessary to watch the testimony Monday. He said that any decision
on whether the House Judiciary Committee will pursue impeachment
proceedings against Clinton is still a long way off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll watch it eventually,'' Kolbe said. ``I think it's an
important piece of all the evidence we have received. We can see
how he answers questions, what his body language is like. That's
useful.''
</P>
<P>
   Reps. John Shadegg and Bob Stump and Sen. Jon Kyl, all
Republicans, said they hadn't had time to view the testimony, so
they couldn't say whether it would affect their opinions on
possible impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until the Judiciary Committee has a chance to work, I'm not
going to say he should be impeached or resign or anything,'' Stump
said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Stump signed a congressional petition earlier this year
supporting a call of impeachment against the president.
</P>
<P>
   Reps. Matt Salmon, R-Ariz., and Ed Pastor, D-Ariz., said through
spokesmen that they would have no comment on the video. Sen. John
McCain, R-Ariz., was traveling and unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Those who did comment were hesitant to speculate on how the
American public would react to the public airing of the testimony.
There have been concerns that some people would turn on Republicans
for making the videotape public.
</P>
<P>
   Shadegg said most callers to his office Monday were opposed to
the release of the video.
</P>
<P>
   ``The American people aren't anxious to hear about this for the
rest of their lives,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Kolbe said Congress had no choice but to release the
information.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a little like shooting the messenger, like we're somehow
responsible by releasing it,'' he said. ``But in this day and age,
you can't keep information away from the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayworth predicted that voters would not lose interest in the
case just because the testimony wasn't a Perry Mason-type
interrogation. He added that he wasn't worried about polls that
show continued strong support for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the president lied under oath, it's impeachable,'' Hayworth
said. ``I don't predicate my designs on polls, but principle.'' &QL;

EDITORIAL: JAPAN'S PARALYSIS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial on Tuesday, Sept. 22:
</P>
<P>
   A political deal on how to close insolvent Japanese banks
appears to be unraveling rapidly, raising the specter of continued
inaction on the financial crisis facing the world's second-largest
economy. That would constitute an abdication of responsibility not
only to the Japanese people but to the global economy that needs a
healthy Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi, who is to meet with President
Clinton on Tuesday, supposedly had worked out a deal with
opposition parties in the Japanese Parliament to have the state
take over insolvent banks, but it is now in doubt because of
opposition to the use of public money to keep such banks afloat
before they are taken over. Moreover, the prime minister, in an
interview with editors and reporters from The New York Times, said
on Monday that he believed that stockholders in the banks should be
compensated by the government, a misguided position that is likely
to be unpopular in Japan, and deservedly should be.
</P>
<P>
   The Japanese government needs to make it clear that it will bail
out depositors, but not owners, of failed banks. The government
also needs to move promptly to determine which banks must be closed
and which can continue. Protecting depositors will cost large
amounts of public money, and the political opposition needs to
understand and accept that.
</P>
<P>
   Without action, the credit crunch, which has made loans hard to
come by for Japanese businesses, will continue indefinitely,
delaying recovery from Japan's severe recession and thereby making
recovery even less likely in other Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   The bad-debt problem for Japanese banks is huge, but it is
manageable in an economy as wealthy as Japan's. Japan would benefit
from quick action, but even if there were agreement, it would take
time to institute a plan. With the risk of Japanese inaction high,
it is more necessary than ever for the other major economies _
particularly Germany and the United States _ to take steps such as
lowering interest rates in an effort to stimulate world growth.

KINGS' KIDS FACE DIFFICULT ADJUSTMENT

   LOS ANGELES _ The good news for the Kings over the weekend was
the play of some of their young prospects.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news was that it didn't mean a whole lot.
</P>
<P>
   Seven players aged 19 to 22 collected three goals and five
assists, and a number of other young prospects also played as the
Kings split a pair of exhibition games with the Colorado Avalanche
at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. But for all of them, the work is
just beginning.
</P>
<P>
   At 7:35 tonight, when the Kings play the Mighty Ducks at the
Forum, it will be the third game in four nights for 19-year-old
center Olli Jokinen (who had an assist against Colorado) and
20-year-old left wing Josh Green. Other young prospects slated to
see action include right wing Pavel Rosa (21), center Chris Schmidt
(22) and winger Joe Corvo (21).
</P>
<P>
   Centers Matt Zultek (19), Scott Barney (19), Donald MacLean (21)
and Roman Vopat (22), and defensemen Richard Seeley (19), Sean
Blanchard (20), and Peter Hogan (20) all played in one or both of
the games over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to play them,'' Robinson said. ``Even if they make
mistakes, now is the time to play them. They're learning from the
experience and from their mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   The player with perhaps the greatest adjustment is the 6-foot-2,
210-pound Jokinen, the third player selected in the 1997 NHL draft.
Jokinen was held pointless in eight games with the Kings last year
before returning to play in his native Finland.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a big jump,'' Jokinen said. ``Last year, I had played
only one year in the top league in Finland, and after that I had to
go to the NHL. Every guy is stronger and bigger here. Everything is
different here. I wasn't ready to play last year. I feel good
now.''
</P>
<P>
   Though Jokinen's adjustment may be the greatest, all the
prospects are having to adapt.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to adjust to another level,'' Robinson said. ``And
all these kids were head and shoulders above the other players in
junior. Now, they have to adjust to playing in a situation where
everyone is at their level. They have to pick it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Double trouble?
</P>
<P>
   Two referees will be used for tonight's game, part of the
experiment that will see each team play 20 of 82 regular-season
games with two referees.
</P>
<P>
   The weekend games in Las Vegas were played with two referees,
and were not bogged down by a preponderance of penalties, as some
had feared they would be. Rob Shick and Lyle Seitz called 21
penalties for 60 minutes on the Kings in the two games, and 24
penalties for 66 minutes on the Avalanche. Twelve of the penalties
and 60 of the minutes were for fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Robinson said he liked what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was great,'' Robinson said. ``It eliminates the
chippiness behind the play and also will save on wear and tear on
the referees. It forces the players to play hard, with no
retaliation.''
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   No. 1 center Jozef Stumpel, sidelined since the first day of
camp with an ankle sprain, skated Monday, but is not expected to
play tonight or Friday against Phoenix. Rookie center Jason Morgan
remains sidelined with knee tendinitis, but may skate Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Stand in-line
</P>
<P>
   The Kings will hold a season-long in-line hockey tournament for
the first time, with games to be played on a portable rink in the
Forum parking lot before 11 of their weekend games. There will be
youth, adult, coed and women's divisions.

NASA ASKS FOR $660 MILLION TO BAIL OUT RUSSIANS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: SUBS 17th graf, The situation ..., to fix name of publication

 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Worried that trouble in Moscow is threatening its own dreams,
NASA wants to spend up to $660 million over five years to bail out
its Russian partner in building a planned international space
station, agency officials said Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Key members of Congress immediately faulted the proposal as too
expensive, clouding the fate of the biggest science project of all
time. But NASA officials argued that the American and Russian
programs are now linked so intimately that the Russian effort must
be preserved lest the American space program suffer.
</P>
<P>
   In just two months, orbital construction is to start on the
sprawling outpost for astronauts, which is expected to cost more
than $40 billion. But even if the new bailout goes through and
keeps the Russians afloat, the station project is facing another
round of construction delays next year because of Russia's problems
in building a key part. The lag in that work will also have costly
repercussions for the nation's fleet of space shuttles, which are
to carry station elements into orbit.
</P>
<P>
   Already, past delays have cut the flight rate of the winged
spaceships to unusually low levels, and NASA officials are
scrambling to find new shuttle payloads to compensate for looming
gaps in outpost construction.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Rothenberg, associate administrator for space flight at
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, said in an
interview that the new bid to save the Russians and the beleaguered
outpost is likely to cost about $1.2 billion, including the new
money for the Russians as well as about $540 million in new
American work such as modifying the shuttles so they can do more
station lifting.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a plan,'' he said of the Russia aid. ``No commitment
from anybody has been made'' to provide new funds.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg said the space agency had already squeezed its own
$13.6 billion budget as far as possible to find emergency funds for
the outpost's rescue, and that it was eager for new money.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Rothenberg said, NASA wants to pay the Russians $60
million this fiscal year for new goods and services and then up to
$150 million a year over the next four years as an aid to station
construction.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.2 billion in emergency money, Rothenberg said, was much
cheaper than losing Moscow's help altogether. ``Any alternative you
look at without the Russians would hit the program hard,''
Rothenberg said. Their absence, he said, would delay the outpost's
construction by years and add up to $2 billion in costs.
</P>
<P>
   But top members of Congress are questioning the new bailout.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given NASA's track record, we are justifiably concerned and
skeptical,'' said Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate
Commerce Committee, which oversees NASA.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics go further, saying NASA officials should put the
whole station project on indefinite hold.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're trying to stick with a failed strategy,'' James Oberg,
an American expert on the Russian space program, said in an
interview. He said the station's delays threatened to add billions
of dollars in hidden costs to NASA's shuttle operations. ``Next
year's shuttle schedule is entirely up in the air.''
</P>
<P>
   At worst, Oberg said, NASA could end up with a half-built
station with the Russians entirely out of the picture if their
downward spiral continues. He said it would be much better to pause
now and rethink the station venture from the ground up.
</P>
<P>
   The plan for station cooperation arose in 1993 after the Cold
War. The Clinton administration saw Moscow's participation as an
important symbol of new cooperation between East and West.
Supporting the Russian program was also viewed as a way to keep
Russian space scientists employed in peaceful pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   After five years of close collaboration, ties between the
Russian and American space station efforts are now so extensive
that repercussions of Russia's financial turmoil have increasingly
roiled American plans, budgets and gear. Last month, for example,
Russia's main spaceport temporarily lost power because of unpaid
bills, postponing a number of rocket launchings and sending shock
waves through Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The situation ``is deteriorating,'' NASA told the White House in
a confidential briefing in late July that was made public by NASA
Watch, an Internet publication.
</P>
<P>
   In the briefing, NASA said the Russian Space Agency needed $340
million this year to build parts for its share of the international
outpost, but so far had received only $20 million from its
government. The outlook for improvement ``is bleak,'' the
assessment said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeffrey Manber, managing director of Energia Ltd., the American
arm of a top Russian contractor making station parts, strongly
agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The philosophical question,'' he said in an interview, ``is
whether you maintain the illusion that the government of Russia can
keep its objectives or do you deal with Russian industry for goods
and services.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Washington has paid Moscow $742 million for
station-related work, Congressional experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the White House has taken to rejecting NASA requests
for new bailout funds to aid the Russians, so the agency has raided
its own budget. But criticism in Congress, among scientists and in
the aerospace community is rising.
</P>
<P>
   ``NASA needs to stop draining other vital programs to feed the
space station's voracious hunger for more money,'' Space News, an
industry publication, said in an editorial last month.

</P>
<P>
   The developing crisis in the International Space Station has
been overshadowed in the past year or so by the travails of its
wobbly predecessor, the Russian Mir outpost, which has suffered a
fire, navigation breakdowns and a collision with a supply ship.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, orbital construction of the follow-on station was to
begin in November 1997. But the threadbare Russians kept missing
deadlines. So the starting date slipped to June of this year and
then to November, a year later than planned.
</P>
<P>
   The outpost's first element, 43 feet long, paid for by the
United States and built by Russia, is now scheduled to ride into
space atop a Russian rocket roughly two months from now. Then, over
five or six years, scores of Russian rocket and American shuttle
launchings are to loft 500 tons of parts and supplies. When it is
finished, the outpost of laboratories and living areas nearly the
size of two football fields will orbit hundreds of miles above
earth, powered by huge arrays of solar-energy cells,
</P>
<P>
   Today, the main hurdle is not the station's first element, which
the Russians have ready to go for launching in November, nor the
second, which the Americans have ready to go for launching in
December. Rather, it is the third _ the first element to be
fabricated by Russia on its own. This so-called service module
would provide early living quarters and, more important, would
provide propellant tanks and thrusters to keep the craft in
position. It is officially set for launching in April but is
unfinished and its fate is increasingly uncertain.
</P>
<P>
   American experts say Russia needs up to $210 million to finish,
test and launch the crucial unit. It might be ready to fly in July
1999 at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, American officials are loath to send up the first
modules without confidence that the vital third one will show up
relatively soon thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   To aid the Russians, the space agency is now seeking to buy two
lifeboats for the station from Russia at a cost of roughly $100
million, Rothenberg said.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg insisted that taking $100 million from other NASA
programs was prudent and that the money would eventually be paid
back. The current goal, he added, is to rush Moscow $60 million by
the end of this month.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, NASA is working on its own partial backup to
the Russian service module, a skeleton unit that would periodically
lift the outpost into a safer orbit. The agency is also preparing
to have the shuttles modified so their engines can aid the lifting
job.
</P>
<P>
   Things will be clearer after agency officials meet with the
Russians late this month, after which schedules will be recast, yet
again.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, most shuttle flights that NASA had planned for this
year were for station construction. But delays cut this year's
flights from four to one. As a result, by the time Sen. John Glenn
rockets into space in October, there will have been no shuttle
launchings for five months, a silence on the launching pad that
NASA officials say is dangerous. They say the rocket specialists at
the Florida spaceport must loft shuttles regularly or loose their
edge.
</P>
<P>
   Today, they are struggling to keep launching teams in Florida
sharp with computer simulations, while they search for alternate
payloads. One developing plan is to have the shuttles send up
logistics materials and supplies ahead of schedule. Another is to
add a science mission unconnected to the outpost.
</P>
<P>
   In the more distant future, Rothenberg noted, demands on the
shuttles will actually soar since Russia has informed NASA it
cannot afford to launch unpiloted resupply ships to the outpost at
the rate it expected.
</P>
<P>
   While 33 Russian supply ships were originally promised to haul
up cargo and propellant, the number has now dwindled to 15 or 17,
and the shuttles will have to take up the slack.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's put a change into the program,'' Rothenberg said.

DREAMWORKS AND DEVELOPER AGREE ON MOVIE STUDIO 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Ending contentious negotiations that appeared
doomed as recently as last month, the fledgling movie studio
Dreamworks SKG and a real-estate development company backed by New
York investment houses reached an agreement Monday for the studio
to build its new home in a coastal development heralded as the
future of urban planning.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks, the first new Hollywood studio in 60 years, is
headed by Steven Spielberg, Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. It
has been negotiating to build on the coastal site since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The studio is critical to the 1,087-acre development, which will
also include housing and commercial space, because it brings with
it at least $75 million in city and state tax incentives.
Dreamworks expects to spend $200 million on the studio, building 15
sound stages and using the latest technology, on the site where
Howard Hughes built his ``Spruce Goose'' seaplane.
</P>
<P>
   Dreamworks and the developer, Playa Vista, announced Monday that
they had agreed to terms laying out how many acres and how much
money any deal would involve. The studio and the developer said the
term agreement was a significant step toward a final agreement and,
ultimately, construction.
</P>
<P>
   Peter Denniston, the president of Playa Vista, said he expected
the land to become available to Dreamworks for construction in the
first quarter of next year, with an opening in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Parcel size, control over development and price were hard-fought
issues that nearly led the negotiators to walk away from the table
last month.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter on Aug. 12, Katzenberg informed the project's
investors, Morgan Stanley Dean Witter &AMP; Co., and Goldman, Sachs &AMP;
Co., that Dreamworks had made its final offer, a $20 million
payment _ in addition to the tax credits _ for full control of the
development on 48 acres of land.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Katzenberg said in the letter, the developers had
agreed to the $20 million price tag, only to raise it to $48.7
million. After receiving the letter, the developer suggested
building some of the studio space on its own and leasing it to
Dreamworks.
</P>
<P>
   Though neither side would comment publicly on the terms of the
deal, a source close to the negotiations said the two sides agreed
on the $20 million purchase price for 48 acres of land, with full
development control to the studio.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to believe that every good deal may die several deaths
before it closes,'' Denniston said, ``and part of the process with
the deal dying a partial death is testing the limits of the other
party. I think this deal is clearly one where Dreamworks' limits
were tested and where our limits were tested.''

THE RECORD THAT RULED THE ORIOLES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BALTIMORE _ Not long after Cal Ripken surpassed Lou Gehrig's
consecutive-game record on Sept. 6, 1995, a consensus began
building among the Baltimore Orioles' staff and front office
officials that the team would be better off if the streak ended.
The goal was simple: to restore the normal hierarchy that governs a
sports team.
</P>
<P>
   With other teams, the pecking order ranks as follows: owner,
baseball executives, manager, players. With the Orioles, Ripken
loomed over everyone, untouchable because of the magnitude of his
record and the popularity it provided him. His recent managers,
from Phil Regan to Davey Johnson to Ray Miller, never seriously
considered benching him unilaterally.
</P>
<P>
   The idea was bandied about constantly by club officials. In a
meeting before the All-Star Game break in July, an Orioles official
announced his belief that the team would never win a World Series
championship until Ripken's record and corollary autonomy ended.
``This record has nothing to do with the team,'' the official told
others. ``Its only meaning is to Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   But the official conceded aloud that no change could be made
until Ripken decided to end the streak himself. No one in a
position of authority was willing to throw themselves into the path
of his legendary willfulness.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, on Sunday night at Camden Yards, Ripken took the
responsibility upon himself, volunteering to sit out the game
against the Yankees and thus ending his streak at 2,632 games. He
was back in the lineup at third base last night, but his record
streak, an achievement that gripped the baseball world three years
ago and helped restore the sport's popularity after years of
divisive labor troubles, had come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken is so resolute in his approach to playing the game that
some of his closest friends on the team said in recent years that
they could never imagine him voluntarily removing himself from the
lineup _ even with the vague knowledge that others in the
organization wanted him to sit. But Ripken is also very protective
of his image, and he was well aware of the mounting criticism that
his record no longer contained relevance. He had gone far beyond
Gehrig's record, his run production was among the worst in the
American League, and the Orioles had young players waiting in the
wings. Whose purpose did it serve to have Ripken play every single
game?
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, Peter Angelos, the Orioles' owner, received a phone
call from Joe Foss, the team's vice chairman. Foss related a
conversation he just had with Miller, who had met privately with
Ripken. ``Cal is thinking about ending the streak,'' Foss told
Angelos.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Angelos said: ``I was somewhat surprised. Cal will
always be a legend, and I can't believe anybody will ever come
close to touching his record. I thought it was a good idea to end
it, at this time _ but at the same time, we didn't want to do
something damaging to Cal.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken said after Sunday's 5-4 loss to the Yankees that he
thought during the summer about ending his streak, and tried to
identify the best possible timing, in the best possible place. He
spoke to his wife, to his close circle of friends, to his parents.
Ripken considered ending his streak on the season's final day, when
the Orioles are to play in Boston. But ultimately, he determined
closure would come here, in Baltimore, in the final home game of
the year, with the Orioles out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought about it and decided, `Let's end it in the same
place it started,''' Ripken said. ``In my home state, in front of
the best fans in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Ripken called his parents earlier in the day and received ``the
answer I expected to hear'' _ they supported whatever decision he
made. He did not tell teammates after arriving at Camden Yards on
Sunday, and he went through his usual pre-game routine. Miller
penciled Ripken into his lineup, though the manager acknowledged,
``I had a feeling,'' based on their previous conversation.
</P>
<P>
   About half an hour before the game, Ripken walked into Miller's
office and said, ``Today's the day.'' Miller responded. ``Are you
sure?'' The manager repeated that question twice more before he
scratched Ripken's name from the lineup and replaced it with that
of Ryan Minor. Ripken called Angelos at home to deliver the news
directly.
</P>
<P>
   After the game, Ripken said: ``Baseball has always been a team
game, and I've always thought the focus should be on the team, and
there have been times during the streak that the focus was on the
streak, and I never felt totally comfortable with that. It just
reached a point where I firmly believe it was time to change the
subject and restore the focus back where it should be.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ripken always plays catch in front of the Orioles' dugout before
each game, but when he did not appear, some of the Yankees began to
wonder whether they were about to witness history. ``He was sitting
over there, waiting like a possum for something to happen,'' said
Joe Torre, the Yankees' manager.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Chambliss, the hitting coach, usually carries the Yankees'
lineup to the umpires before each game, but Torre, suspecting
something, went instead. Miller walked out of the Orioles' dugout,
and when Torre reached eagerly for his counterpart's lineup card,
Miller pulled back. ``And then I saw Minor's name in there,'' Torre
said.
</P>
<P>
   After Torre returned to the dugout, some of his players examined
the lineup card like a priceless relic _ a Baltimore lineup without
Ripken's name included. Joe Girardi, the Yankee catcher, suggested
to others that after the first out they should all step out and tip
their caps to Ripken. Later, Ripken would say that this gesture
touched him deeply.
</P>
<P>
   In the Baltimore dugout, the phone rang. Alan Mills, a relief
pitcher, called to ask Ripken what he was doing and why he did not
tell anybody, and so Ripken made a point of spending some time in
the bullpen, chatting with fans. When Ripken was in the dugout, he
fidgeted constantly, shifting his hands and his feet, not sure what
to do or how to kill time. So that's what a day off feels like, he
remarked later.
</P>
<P>
   Miller said he intended to start Ripken in the rest of the games
this season. Ripken said he still viewed himself ``as an everyday
player,'' and he will go into next year preparing to play every
game, as he has his entire career.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the streak is over, Ripken will have more freedom
to take a day off, and Miller will have more freedom to incorporate
other players.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a realist,'' Ripken said. ``At some point, it was going to
end.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At the Rialto Theater, ``Romper Room'' and ``Liquid
Lips'' were neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   No other building so jauntily symbolized the bewildering
confluence in Times Square of showmen, con men, impresarios,
prelates and hustlers than the Jazz Age jewel box called the
Rialto, at ground zero, Broadway and 42nd Street.
</P>
<P>
   Like the square itself, the Rialto catered to every taste;
sometimes simultaneously, as in the 1970s, when X-rated films
played in the auditorium downstairs while ``The Joe Franklin
Show,'' ``Bowling for Dollars'' and ``Romper Room'' were being
broadcast from the WOR-TV studios upstairs.
</P>
<P>
   And like the square itself _ at least those Runyonesque,
dime-a-dance, quarter-a-peep vestiges of an imperfectly remembered
era _ the Rialto is about to be consigned to history.
</P>
<P>
   In its place, a 30-story corporate nerve center called the
Reuters Building is to begin rising next year.
</P>
<P>
   While other buildings have been razed to make way for the
redevelopment of 42nd Street, the Rialto stands out for its
exuberant architecture, historical roots (an earlier Rialto was
built on the same spot in 1898) and inimitable cast of characters.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is a place near and dear to my life,'' said Geraldo
Rivera, whose nose was broken there. Now the host of ``Rivera
Live'' and an anchor on CNBC, Rivera broadcast from the Rialto
between 1986 and 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, Franklin's talk show was based at the Rialto for
more than a dozen of its 43 years on the air. ``I'm going to miss
the organic, from-the-bones feeling I got from the Rialto,''
Franklin said last week.
</P>
<P>
   Already, demolition crews are at work. But no one is surprised
by the theater's demise. That was as good as guaranteed in 1981,
when state and city officials drew up plans to build four office
towers at the crossroads of 42nd Street, Broadway and Seventh
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Preservation fever scarcely touched the Rialto. Its distinctive
features _ columns of milky-white glass blocks, chevronlike
casement windows, round-edged aluminum fins and cobalt-blue glass
panels _ are on the second and third floors. New Yorkers rarely
gaze that high.
</P>
<P>
   (Of course, with ground-floor tenants like the Funny Store, an
emporium of rubber chickens and whoopee cushions, who could blame
them?)
</P>
<P>
   ``It was written off as not important when the fate of 42nd
Street was decided,'' said Francoise Bollack, an architect and
architectural historian. ``It was so hidden behind boards and signs
that it took more imagination than was available to remember it or
see what it looked like.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   A century ago, Oscar Hammerstein built a theater called the
Victoria at Broadway and 42nd Street. It was renamed the Rialto,
calling itself the ``temple of the motion picture and shrine of
music and the allied arts'' after a remodeling in 1916, and was run
by S.L. (Roxy) Rothafel.
</P>
<P>
   In 1935, the present four-story structure was built. The
manager, Arthur Mayer, promised an ``ultramodern'' theater with
``perfect acoustics and sight lines in preference to grand
stairways, fabulous restrooms and marble atrocities.''
</P>
<P>
   Rosario Candela and Thomas Lamb were the architects. They
included a connection to the subway through an underground shopping
arcade, and at the corner, an 80-foot glass-block tower that
advertised Schenley whisky.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Buck's ``Fang and Claw,'' an animal picture, opened the
Rialto in December 1935. Mayer soon earned the nickname Merchant of
Menace for the steady diet he offered of mayhem, murder, mystery
and melodrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like a flower of evil,'' The New York Times declared in 1936,
``the new Rialto Theater has endeared itself to a little coterie of
necrophiles that haunt the area as a perfect rendezvous for
Witches' Sabbats and Walpurgis Eve celebrations.''
</P>
<P>
   And those were the good old days.
</P>
<P>
   The postwar transformation of Times Square into a realm of
drug-dealing and prostitution took a toll on the Rialto. Its arcade
was so notorious that it was closed in 1961 by Mayor Robert Wagner.
</P>
<P>
   WOR-TV moved into studios above the auditorium in the late
1960s. Even as ``stamp out smut'' rallies were held outside,
``Romper Room'' was produced within.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a hell of a place to bring 5-year-olds,'' allowed Rick
Miner, the executive director of production and engineering at
WWOR, successor to WOR.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't ideal for the elderly, either. Miner's father was once
propositioned by a young hustler at the front door. Corinne
Griffith, a silent-screen star known as the Orchid Lady, refused to
enter.
</P>
<P>
   ``When she saw it was a porno theater downstairs,'' Franklin
said, ``she wouldn't come to my studio.''
</P>
<P>
   There were other perils, like unreliable elevators. Neil
Borrell, now a director at WWOR, remembered a day that Terence
Cardinal Cooke, in the studio to tape a sermon, was stuck in the
elevator with a group of teen-age girls. Franklin was trapped in
the elevator for four hours with the director Otto Preminger.
``Ooooh, he was furious,'' the host recalled.
</P>
<P>
   For a brief spell in the early '80s, the theater downstairs was
a legitimate playhouse. But the first production closed after 20
performances, the second after 14 and the third never made it out
of previews. Soon, movies like ``Hot Dog Kung Fu'' were back on the
bill.
</P>
<P>
   In 1986, the Rialto was turned into a first-run movie house and
renamed the Cineplex Odeon Warner. Where Arthur Mayer promised
perfect acoustics, Garth H. Drabinsky, then president of the
Cineplex Odeon chain, made a promise more in keeping with the time
and place: ``No one's going to smoke crack here.''
</P>
<P>
   That same year, after WOR moved to Secaucus, N.J., Rivera moved
in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I shed some blood there,'' he said, speaking of a 1988 episode
when fists and chairs were thrown and his nose was broken after a
white supremacist insulted Roy Innis, chairman of the Congress of
Racial Equality.
</P>
<P>
   New York State took possession of the Rialto in 1990. After a
renovation in 1995, several interim tenants were installed to
maintain a sense of vitality on the block.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the Reuters Building will pay homage to the
Rialto, said William C. Rudin, whose family is developing the new
tower in a joint venture with Reuters, the news and information
agency.
</P>
<P>
   An undulating band of windows and columns above the storefronts
will recall the rhythm of the Rialto facade, said Bruce Fowle of
Fox &AMP; Fowle Architects, designers of the new tower. ``We think it
will develop its own historic nostalgia over time,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Miner, however, is not convinced the Rialto can be replaced.
``It was the old Times Square milieu, which I'll miss,'' he said.
``If I wanted to live in Disneyland, I'd move to Orlando.''

CHILDREN ARE DECORATING THEIR BACKPACKS WITH KEYCHAINS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: N.Y., Pa., Ohio, Calif.)  (af)  
 By MICHAEL BRICK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Parents shopping this month for pencils, notebooks, crayons and
backpacks can add a new item to the school supplies list _ key
chains, and lots of them. Dangling from the backpacks of the
country's schoolchildren, they signify a booming market that barely
existed two school years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Puzzled by the sudden demand for key chains, toy and
entertainment industry executives and analysts are questioning
their own children, who decorate their backpacks with dozens of
dangling doodads. Their explanation is simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like how they look on my backpack and the sound they
make when they click together,'' said Isabel Zuckoff, 9, who owns
around 30 key chains and no keys.
</P>
<P>
   Whether the motivation is how the chains look or how they sound,
or both, the trend has translated into a hot business for a handful
of companies with names like Basic Fun Inc. and the Fun 4 All Corp.
All told, toy industry analysts say, key chains priced at $3 to $10
generate around $50 million a year in retail sales to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not just the children in New York City,'' said Scott
Bachrach, president of Fun 4 All, which is based in New York. ``You
can go out to middle America and see children with these on their
backpacks. Where an average kid has only two keys, they're still
going to go out and buy six to eight different key chains.''
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of key chains has caught the big toy companies by
surprise. After all, it is not easy to guess that children, few of
whom carry much more than a single house key, would become some of
the nation's most frequent repeat buyers of key chains.
</P>
<P>
   The small licensee companies selling key chain toys and games
``are really trying to keep it quiet,'' said Sean McGowan, an
analyst at Gerard Klauer Mattison Inc. in New York. ``There's no
reason Hasbro couldn't do it. No one knew how big it was going to
be.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Why children are buying so many key chains is a complicated
story involving cheap jewelry, the Internet and Isabel's backpack.
</P>
<P>
   It begins in 1989, with Alan Dorfman, now the president of Basic
Fun, working at Larami Ltd. in Philadelphia, selling Super Soaker
water guns and dreaming of starting his own business. After he left
Larami to start Basic Fun, Dorfman started noticing young women
wearing miniature water guns as necklaces, and he asked his former
bosses for a license to market shrunken Super Soaker key chains.
</P>
<P>
   Basic Fun began shipping Super Soaker key chains in January
1993, following them the next year with Etch-a-Sketch key chains,
made under a license from the Ohio Art Co. Sales have jumped 30
percent to 60 percent a year since 1993, orfman said.
</P>
<P>
   The company's products now range from those made under license,
including cartoon characters like Nickelodeon's Rugrats and toys
like Hasbro's Potato Head, to public domain games like Tic Tac Toe.
Most of the new key chains have one thing in common: as the
grade-school set might say, they do stuff. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Adults are generally satisfied with key chains that look nice or
serve as mementos or souvenirs. But for children raised in the age
of computers, the most popular key chains are, of course,
interactive. That includes all of the miniature games and most of
the licensed characters.
</P>
<P>
   Curious George was fun as a quizzical little monkey, but as a
key chain, he is more fun because the hat he wears comes off.
</P>
<P>
   The popularity of toy and game key chains initially sent
established purveyors of old-fashioned key chains scrambling to
catch up. Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh key chains have been a
staple at the gift company Applause Inc. for years, but sales went
soft for a while after Basic Fun started luring children to
interactive key chains, a spokeswoman for Applause said.
</P>
<P>
   Then gift companies like Applause added moving parts to some of
their offerings in an effort to reclaim part of their lost sales,
and the interactive key chains settled in as a separate category
from the souvenir and trinket key chains.
</P>
<P>
   The story might have ended there, except for Isabel's backpack.
Because it seems that when children became interested in key chain
toys and games, they turned the products into a new kind of
collectible _ the nirvana of marketing.
</P>
<P>
   Key chain-sized Monopoly is not easy to play. But that's no
longer the point, according to Stevanne Auerbach, a San
Francisco-based analyst who writes a syndicated column under the
name Dr. Toy.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to be miniaturizing everything they can get their
hands on,'' Ms. Auerbach said. ``What teens like to have is
conversational items that allow them to have status in their
groups. This is the current craze.''
</P>
<P>
   And unlike some bygone crazes, like pogs, stickers and lunch
boxes, key chains can be marketed outside an identifiable niche.
Boys and girls both buy key chains to attach to their backpacks,
and adults will sometimes buy them to, well, attach to their keys. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Bachrach pitches Basic Fun's key chains to toy stores, clothing
outlets and drugstores, among others. For the big toy makers, sales
of key chains licensed from established products can mean increased
exposure without the need to develop miniatures on their own or
take the initial risk.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're getting exposure in higher traffic areas of the store
where our products are placed,'' Dorfman said. ``They're also
getting exposure in places like girls' clothing and accessory shops
where they would never sell an Etch-a-Sketch.''
</P>
<P>
   But some analysts say the toy giants may have passed up a
profitable venture. The thing is that for all their advertising
muscle, big toy makers and entertainment companies cannot create a
collectible. Only the 9-year-olds can.
</P>
<P>
   In the board rooms of the big companies, executives consider new
products. Industry staples like key chains are considered a
stagnant but reliable market best left to licensees. But with key
chains reaching collectible status, major toy makers have started
to take notice, approaching the niche companies with licensing
offers.
</P>
<P>
   But while the key chain makers have stumbled upon a collectible,
it is not necessarily the stable kind, which can be expected to
increase in value. Not even Bachrach would say that is likely to be
true of key chains. And so opinion is divided on how long the
market can be expected to remain viable.
</P>
<P>
   Declining to guess at the whims of adolescents, McGowan, the
analyst, predicted that key chains _ if not miniaturized toys _
would remain popular for some time. But Ms. Auerbach and some
retailers pointed to the start of the new school year as the big
test for any product aimed at young consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trend may be over before you know it, or it may be the
second wave,'' Ms. Auerbach said. ``It's really impossible to know
what's going to catch the fancy of children.'' &QL;

HOLYFIELD PUTS HIMSELF ON OUTSIDE LOOKING IN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By RICHARD SANDOMIR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For one night, Evander Holyfield is trying a new
profession: fight analyst.
</P>
<P>
   Why? ``I like talking,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield will work with Sugar Ray Leonard and blow-by-blow
announcer Kevin Harlan Tuesday night for TNT on a boxing show in
the Theater at Madison Square Garden. Dressed in black for a
production meeting yesterday in a sixth-floor office at the Garden,
Holyfield looked unscathed from his unanimous yet uninspired
12-round decision over Vaughn Bean 36 hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield insisted that he would fight his next mandatory bout,
against Henry Akinwande, and then seek to unify the heavyweight
championship against Lennox Lewis, the World Boxing Council
titleholder. Mike Tyson is not in his plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``My goal is the undisputed championship,'' said Holyfield, who
holds the International Boxing Federation and World Boxing
Association titles. ``I want to get there as quick as possible. I'd
only fight Tyson if he has a title.'' Jim Thomas, Holyfield's
lawyer, said, ``He has no need or desire to fight Tyson.''
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield appeared energized at the production meeting, talking
to boxers about nutrition, electrolytes, making weight and having
candid advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're at the top, you're alone,'' he told Sugar Shane
Mosley, the IBF lightweight champion, who is scheduled to fight
Eduardo Morales. ``I have a trainer who I have to listen to. You
need people who are always adding something to improve you. You
need a corner that tells you the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Mosley, the fighter's father, said: ``That's what I've told
him since he's 8. If he's looking bad, I have to tell him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen you box,'' Holyfield told Mosley. ``I've seen the
way you shift gears. Go up one level, then two more levels.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But with control,'' Jack Mosley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to be in great shape to make your heart rate go up
and down, up and down,'' Holyfield said. ``It's easy to fight a
fast fight or a slow fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm cranky when I'm not doing something,'' Shane Mosley said.
``That's why I went to the gym in the first place. I was 6,
bouncing off the walls.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You were 6, I was 8,'' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield was quiet as Leonard talked to Angel Manfredy, the
World Boxing Union super featherweight champion, a fiercely
confident personality with a torso full of tattoos, a religious
conversion and numerous car accidents on his resume.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in 13 car accidents,'' Manfredy said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Same car?'' Leonard asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, 13 cars,'' he said. ``My last one I didn't walk away from.
That's when I met the Lord.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many tattoos do you have?'' Harlan asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want me to count?'' Manfredy asked as he doffed a tank
top.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got one,'' said Leonard, and he pulled aside his pullover to
show it on his chest. ``It's the most pain I ever felt. Especially
in the soft tissue.''
</P>
<P>
   Lou Del Valle, a Bronx light heavyweight who lost a fight last
July to Roy Jones Jr., confessed to Holyfield and Leonard that he
had ``choked.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have fought better,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did you learn?'' Leonard asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That I have to be more disciplined,'' Del Valle said. He said
he has let his weight soar between fights, forcing him to lose too
much to make weight.
</P>
<P>
   ``How high have you gone?'' Leonard asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two twenty-eight,'' Del Valle said. ``It all goes to my
thighs.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a heavyweight,'' Holyfield said.
</P>
<P>
   Del Valle nodded, seemingly abashed at trying to restart his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``After you knocked Jones down, what did you think?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dollar signs,'' Del Valle said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You hurt him and really raised him off the canvas,'' Leonard
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought I'd hurt him more,'' Del Valle said.
</P>
<P>
   Tyrone Armstead, a bouncer from Evansville, Ind., will face Del
Valle. After discussing how he came to accept the fight two days
before, his laconic face lit up. He had finally noticed Leonard,
sitting to Holyfield's left.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey man, I didn't recognize you,'' Armstead said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Have you seen Del Valle fight?'' asked Dave Harmon, the
producer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't even know who he is,'' Armstead said.
</P>
<P>
   Harmon expects to have few problems in quickly molding a
credible team out of Harlan, who is calling only his second fight,
Holyfield, who last called a fight for TBS in 1988, and Leonard, a
former HBO commentator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kevin's part will come naturally,'' he said. ``I've talked to
Kevin about how to get Evander and Ray involved. My job is to make
sure they get in.''
</P>
<P>
   Harlan, Holyfield and Leonard, with the reporter Craig Sager,
will be hard-pressed to match Steve Albert, Ferdie Pacheco and
Bobby Czyz, who called the Holyfield-Bean card Saturday night for
Showtime. Suddenly, they have become blisteringly candid
commentators who question boxers' credentials to fight.
</P>
<P>
   And the reporter Jim Gray's interviews with Don King, Holyfield,
Bean and Shelly Finkel, Tyson's adviser, were models for the
profession.
</P>
<P>
   A footnote: among King's guests Saturday were eight of the
jurors who acquitted him last July of Federal insurance fraud
charges, said Billy Murphy Jr., one of King's lawyers. King also
treated them to a Bahamas getaway.

EDITORIAL: THE SHRINKING POWER OF LIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial, Tuesday, Sept. 22:
</P>
<P>
   The sound was buzzy, the picture less than crisp and the man at
the center looked somehow smaller or at least more ordinary. Eyes
blinking, his mouth set in a taut line, President Clinton looked
like an ordinary man defending the ordinary lies he had concocted
to hide an ordinary affair. The political bottom line was obvious.
The four-hour tape of his Aug. 17 grand jury testimony will not
destroy Clinton straightaway, and as an exercise in boil-lancing,
it may help him. A contrarian might even argue that this
performance, while indisputably one of the most low-rent moments in
White House history, will do him less harm than the disastrous
speech that he delivered later that same day.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican Congress may have voted to broadcast the tape as
a hostile partisan act, but the event has served a healthy civic
purpose. The Clinton Presidency has become such a mess that the
public needs to review as much of the evidence as possible in order
to respond intelligently to congressional demands for resignation
or impeachment. After seeing the tape we continue to favor, for the
time being, a negotiated settlement involving censure by Congress,
provided that Clinton abandons, publicly and without qualification,
the central contention of his four-hour marathon in legal evasion.
That contention, of course, is that he did not lie under oath about
having a sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky. Clearly he did.
</P>
<P>
   As a psychological document, the tape was riveting. It showed
all the familiar aspects of Clinton's personality. There was the
canny use of humor, along with winning flashes of charm that even
included a lawyerly bow to ``Judge Starr'' and assertions that he
was doing his best to help the prosecutors and the grand jury. As
always with Clinton, there were cued-up ripples of anger at
malevolent forces that through no fault of his own were aiming a
``wrecking ball'' at him.
</P>
<P>
   There were new, patently surrealistic elements as well. At
times, Clinton seemed to be suppressing an adolescent pride in
enumerating the recycled gifts and tatty grace notes of his
clandestine courtship. When he referred to ``Monica'' and her
Rockettes blanket, one could almost hear the crockery breaking in
the East Wing. Clinton appeared equally out of touch with what it
means to the country to have a presidential paramour throwing a
tantrum in front of White House guards, who are then asked to
disappear their normal paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   What was not as evident as the spinners had predicted was the
president's famous nose-purpling rage. Indeed, his tight control
and forced geniality before the grand jury probably account for the
explosion that took place later that evening. It was displaced rage
that made Clinton lash out at Starr on national television,
insisting against all logic that his account of the Lewinsky affair
was ``legally correct,'' and obliterating yet another chance to end
his travail and the nation's.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury tape, like the Aug. 17 speech, showed us yet
again a defendant hunkered down behind his lawyers rather than a
president seizing control of his political situation and directing
his fate. Analyzed as Clinton biography, what we saw was a haunted
man contemplating a blasted presidency and an irretrievably
diminished reputation. Analyzed from the citizens' point of view,
what we now face is a nation contemplating the grandeur of the
presidency in contrast to an attractive but documentably
dysfunctional personality.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, we must be more interested in the nation's civics
problem than in Clinton's personal situation. We learned Monday
that the electorate will be served by getting as much evidence out
as fast as possible. Even the Democrats who no longer admire him
are trying to help Clinton navigate out of legal jeopardy. The
Republicans who control Congress, fearful of backlash, face both
heavy constitutional responsibilities and significant political
dangers as they try to judge public reaction to Clinton's
humiliating circumstances. Although the polls are shifting, a
majority of citizens are still of a mind to muddle through with a
largely discredited leader rather than disrupt the nation's
anchoring electoral rhythm.
</P>
<P>
   But the settlement that is implicit in these alignments is not
possible if Clinton continues to demand that we, as a people,
endorse his lying. The rule of law is too vital to the future to be
sacrificed as a concession to the president's whims, delusions or
legal jeopardy. Seeing him lie on tape reminds us that on
acceptable terms we can afford to be a nation of forgivers. But we
must not become a nation of enablers.

WITH JOBS GOING BEGGING, FLORIDA COMPANIES ADAPT 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By DENNIS BLANK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ BellSouth Telecommunications of Miami, a unit of
BellSouth Corp., says it has taken more than six months to fill 500
newly created jobs in Florida. Even more surprising, it went
through 10,000 applicants before getting the people it wanted.
</P>
<P>
   The story is the same for other big corporate employers
throughout the South but particularly in Florida, where a lot of
companies have largely abandoned normal recruiting procedures such
as classified advertising to rely on giving signing bonuses,
putting notices on the Internet and offering prizes to employees
who bring in new workers.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Lacher, president of the BellSouth unit, is frustrated that
high schools and colleges are not turning out more qualified
people. ``We have made 10,000 contacts, and we cannot find a
sufficient number of people,'' he said. ``That certainly raises
questions about our education system.''
</P>
<P>
   It also says something about the tightness of the labor market
at a time when unemployment nationwide is just 4.5 percent; it is
even lower in many economic hot spots such as Florida and
California.
</P>
<P>
   BellSouth Telecommunications now has a work force of 12,000 in
Florida, and customer demand for more phones forced the company to
create the new jobs last December. Starting pay for phone service
representatives is $19,200 a year and for installers, $21,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has been a virtual explosion in people adding second
lines,'' said Spero Canton, a company spokesman. ``Growth has gone
beyond people's expectations. The demand for second lines for
modems, fax machines and a kid's line is standard now.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has a very ``demanding'' test, which results in a
high number of failures, Canton said. In addition, most applicants
do not have enough technical education or do not pass the company
drug test, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In many cases, it has taken longer than we expected,'' Canton
said, ``but we are still making progress.''
</P>
<P>
   The pool of qualified applicants for both skilled and unskilled
jobs continues to shrink as the state's unemployment rate rides at
a low 4.3 percent, with Orlando the lowest at 3 percent, according
to the latest figures. It is common for major employers like Walt
Disney Co., Harris Corp. and Stein Mart to have thousands of
vacancies posted all the time.
</P>
<P>
   More employers are extending their searches to other states and
scouring the Internet job boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Florida is tight up and down the skill levels,'' said Kevin
Brickey, an economist with the Florida Department of Labor. ``We're
seeing quite a lot of employers expand their efforts to a larger
radius than they once did.''
</P>
<P>
   Even in some less skilled jobs, such as those in fast-food
restaurants, employers are raising wages for new workers by 25
cents an hour or more to attract help. And many jobs still go
unfilled.
</P>

<P>
   Disney, the largest employer in the state at a single site _
with 51,000 workers _ has more than 1,000 job openings and is
looking at ways to improve recruiting. ``We are constantly
reinventing ourselves,'' said Kelly Frank, Disney's director of
employment in Orlando. ``We are constantly evaluating our
recruiting tactics.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney frequently offers signing bonuses of $2,000 and in some
cases up to $10,000 for hard-to-fill high-technology jobs.
Moreover, seasonal workers now get a full 40-hour work week with
benefits and more flexible schedules. A few years ago, most got
part-time hours and no benefits.
</P>
<P>
   At Stein Mart Inc., a chain of 900 family clothing stores in 30
states that is based in Jacksonville, Fla., its stores are ``never
totally staffed,'' said Hunt Hawkins, the human resources director.
``It is like spitting in the wind, to put out expensive classified
advertising,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Stein Mart replaced classified advertising with a reward program
for employees who refer new store clerks, who start at $5.50 to
$6.50 an hour. The recruiting employees are given shirts and hats,
and managers get annual $100 bonuses. Even so, the chain says it
takes at least 10 interviews to hire one person.
</P>
<P>
   A task force is putting together a plan to ``identify creative
approaches'' to recruiting the workers needed, especially in major
population centers such as Atlanta, Chicago and San Jose, Calif.,
Hawkins said.
</P>
<P>
   At Harris Corp., a military contractor and manufacturer of
communications equipment that is based in Melbourne, Fla., and
employs 29,000 worldwide, it usually takes six to eight weeks to
fill an opening, Ronald Hutt, senior manager of human resources,
said. Computer-related high-technology positions may go unfilled
for four to five months.
</P>
<P>
   While Harris continues to use classified advertising, job fairs
and $2,000 signing bonuses, it has also found a new conduit by
opening a Web site for college graduates. The candidates can look
over available jobs and file their resumes electronically. In
addition, Harris has built up an internship program with specific
schools that refer top students who alternate working for a
semester and going to school for a semester.
</P>
<P>
   Some employers have also established junior college branches at
work locations to allow workers to take courses in the evening so
they can advance. The Peabody Hotel in Orlando, which employs 800,
has expanded its offerings from food service to marketing,
accounting and convention management courses under a cooperative
agreement with Valencia College.

   Pearle Selects Barkley Evergreen
</P>
<P>
   Pearle Vision Inc. in Dallas, the unit of the Cole National
Corp. that operates the Pearle Vision Centers retail chain, said
Monday that it had named Barkley Evergreen &AMP; Partners in Kansas
City, Mo., to handle its advertising and marketing account, with
billings estimated at $40 million. The account had been handled by
McCann-Erickson New York, part of the McCann-Erickson Worldwide
Advertising division of McCann-Erickson World Group, a unit of the
Interpublic Group of Companies, until that agency and the company
agreed to part ways last week.
</P>
<P>
   The decision came after a review in which the other participants
were not disclosed. However, Adweek listed three other agencies as
participants: Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., also part of
Interpublic; W.B. DonerW. &AMP; Co. in Southfield, Mich., and Wyse
Advertising in Cleveland.

<P>
   Candie's Is Seeking Additional Agency
</P>
<P>
   Candie's Inc. said Monday that it was searching for an
additional agency to join its roster as the trendy footwear
marketer expands into the jeans and fragrance categories.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our company is growing and there is just a need to examine the
resources that are out there to help us meet our advertising
goals,'' David Conn, marketing director at Candie's in Purchase,
N.Y., said in confirming reports of the search this week in
Advertising Age and Adweek. Candie's recently signed a licensing
agreement with Liz Claiborne Inc. to market a fragrance, in
addition to agreeing to acquire the Bongo Jeans label to enter the
jeans market.
</P>
<P>
   Conn said that the company was talking to ``a small group of
agencies,'' but he declined to identify them. The additional new
agency would work with Candie's lead shop, In Marketing in Glen
Cove, N.Y., and its in-house group. A decision is expected by the
end of October, he added.
</P>
<P>
   Candie's spent an estimated $8 million on advertising in the
last year. However, the company plans to increase spending to $10
million to $12 million annually, with an additional $7 million to
$9 million on the fragrance with Liz Claiborne. &QL;

MICHAEL CURRIER, 37, RANCHER WHO HELPED TIBETANS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: N.M., Pa., Va.)  (lb) 
 By ERIC PACE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Michael Stephen Currier, a rancher and philanthropist who was
the manager of the Economic Development Fund for the Tibetan
Community in Exile, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Hospital in
Santa Fe, N.M. He was 37, and lived in Santa Fe.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was injuries suffered in a fall in Santa Fe, his
family said through a spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   For 11 years before his death, he was the manager of the exiles
fund, which he established. The revolving loan fund provides
technical and other aid for small businesses operated by Tibetan
refugees and their descendants in India and the United States.
Those businesses include various Tibetan crafts.
</P>
<P>
   Currier, who visited Tibet and made many trips to meet with
Tibetans in India, wanted to help make Tibetan refugees
economically self-sufficient and to help preserve Tibetan religious
and cultural traditions. The fund was a major recipient of his
philanthropic largess in the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   His family said that they had received a message from the Dalai
Lama, whose headquarters are in India. ``He has been especially
generous in the help he gave us Tibetans,'' the message said, ``and
we will always remain grateful.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 the Dalai Lama presented the Light of Truth Award, a
high honor, to Currier.
</P>
<P>
   A native New Yorker, he was the son of Stephen Currier and the
former Audrey Mellon Bruce, co-founders of the Taconic Foundation,
whose operations have included programs to further equal
opportunity with emphasis on housing and jobs for young people.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Currier's mother was the granddaughter of Andrew Mellon,
the financier, industrialist and philanthropist.
</P>
<P>
   Currier's parents vanished in 1967, while in a private plane
flying over the Caribbean Sea. They were never found.
</P>
<P>
   He was raised by a guardian, graduating from Collegiate School
in New York, Putney School in Vermont and Williams College. In his
early 20s he was a patron of the Morgan Library and of the Gauchos,
a basketball program for children in New York.
</P>
<P>
   An orphan himself, he was devoted to his own children and gave
many grants to programs providing nurturing for children. A grant
from him in 1985 helped expand a community foundation founded by
blacks in Pittsburgh. Other grants from him in the same period
helped found a mental-health crisis center and a wild horse
sanctuary, both in California.
</P>
<P>
   After he moved to Santa Fe, his philanthropies, mostly
anonymous, came to include Southwestern charitable organizations
concerned with the environment, rural economic development, care
and education for needy children and human rights.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the boards of the Taconic Foundation, the Putney
School, the Forest Trust of New Mexico and the Santa Fe Waldorf
School.
</P>
<P>
   He also collected art, chiefly drawings of the old masters and
Chinese works.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, the former Karin Griscom; two sons
and a daughter; two sisters, Andrea Currier and Lavinia Currier of
Plains, Va., and a grandmother, Mary Warburg.

PHILLIPS-HARRIS LAUGH-IN LOOSENS THE METS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By JASON DIAMOS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For all that they have given the New York Mets on the
field, the biggest contribution Lenny Harris and Tony Phillips have
made this season may be the smile they have helped put on Mike
Piazza's face. And on the faces of most of their other teammates,
as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody's got to do it,'' John Franco said of Harris'
sometimes merciless, always good-natured needling of Piazza, who
admits he is now enjoying his stay with the Mets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just keeping him loose is a big contribution,'' Harris said of
Piazza. ``He's been asking me, `Are you coming back?' And I keep
saying, `If you are, I definitely am. If not, I'll have to go
somewhere else.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Mike will be back. He keeps asking me. And I keep
telling him, `I want to be right there behind you. It will be your
spare change.'''
</P>
<P>
   If Harris, who like Piazza can be a free agent after the season,
does not re-sign with the Mets, who will play Motown CDs and do
Temptations dance steps for his teammates? And if Piazza re-signs
and Harris does not, who will be all over the All-Star catcher's
back?
</P>
<P>
   Harris said on Sunday that he will be keeping in touch with
Piazza during the off-season, because Piazza is planning on buying
a house in Harris' native Florida. As if Piazza doesn't get enough
of his former Dodgers teammate now.
</P>
<P>
   When Harris isn't all over Piazza, he is usually going at it
with Phillips, and everyone within earshot is laughing at the class
clowns.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're veteran guys, they've been around and they keep
everyone loose,'' Franco said. ``They've been through this before.
So they know what it's like.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This'' is a playoff race, something Franco, 38, has never
really been through before. But the Mets, who begin a two-game
series at Shea Stadium Tuesday night with the Montreal Expos, have
a one-game lead over the Chicago Cubs in the National League
wild-card race with five games to go.
</P>
<P>
   And Harris and Phillips are two of the reasons why. Phillips,
39, who was acquired from Toronto at the July 31 trading deadline,
played in two World Series with the Oakland Athletics. Harris, 33,
who was obtained from Cincinnati on July 3 for John Hudek, has been
in the playoffs once. Aside from Al Leiter and John Olerud, who won
World Series rings with the Florida Marlins and the Toronto Blue
Jays, and Dennis Cook, Carlos Baerga and Piazza, the Mets are
lacking in postseason experience.
</P>
<P>
   Which adds to Phillips' and Harris' value.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're great veteran players who are terrific guys,'' Manager
Bobby Valentine said after Phillips went 2-for-3 with a run batted
in and a run scored and Harris went 3-for-4 with a run batted in on
Sunday, when the Mets regained the wild-card lead with a 5-0
victory over the Marlins. ``I think that helps immeasurably. They
are good guys added to a good mix. And they are good players.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, said Phillips, is the only contribution that counts.
</P>
<P>
   ``To heck with that contributing in the clubhouse,'' Phillips
said. ``That doesn't keep you playing. If I don't get the job done,
I'm going to be back at my home in Arizona. I don't fall for that
trash, that the reason I'm around is because people like me. The
reason I'm here is that they think I can get the job done. And I
can get the job done.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Indeed, Phillips has provided the Mets with the lead-off hitter
they had lacked. Even though he is batting only .235 in 47 games,
Phillips' 35 walks are the fifth most on the team. And Phillips has
played only 30 percent of the Mets' 157 games.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been great for the ball club that he's been here,''
Harris said of Phillips. ``Without a doubt. Everybody thinks he has
an attitude. But he has an attitude toward the game. Nobody is more
prepared than him.''
</P>
<P>
   High praise. Which, of course, did not stop Harris from taking
one last shot at Phillips. ``He's the best at the joking part,''
said Harris, who has solidified the Mets' outfield since Butch
Huskey went down with an ankle injury and Todd Hundley was taken
out of the starting lineup. ``But Tony's got the worst laugh I've
ever heard in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   One that the Mets have heard frequently with both Harris and
Phillips around.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   John Olerud, who has reached base in 14 consecutive plate
appearances, was named the National League player of the week. It
was the second time this year he had been honored and the fifth
time he had been player of the week, three times in the NL and
twice in the American League. The last time a Met won the award
twice in a season was 1985, when Dwight Gooden and Darryl
Strawberry both won twice. ... Mike Piazza will re-sign with the
Mets if co-owner Nelson Doubleday has any say in it. ``We have
decided to make every effort we can to sign him,'' Doubleday said.
``The way things are going now for Mike here in New York is better
now than it has been. It's really his call. But lord knows, I want
him to stay.'' Will the Mets offer Piazza the $100 million contract
he has indicated he will be seeking? When asked if money was the
issue, Doubleday said: ``From the sublime to the ridiculous, to
that extent it's an issue. But any numbers we've seen or heard are
not ridiculous.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Finally the anchors and pundits fell silent, the tape
rolled, a fuzzy image of President Clinton came on the screens, and
...
</P>
<P>
   And most people continued doing what they were doing on a mild
morning in a city slowed somewhat by the Jewish new year holiday.
When they did pause to watch, whether in a cafe, in an electronics
shop or on the screens at the News Corp. building on 48th and
Sixth, it was often with fatigue, shame and a distinct dollop of
sympathy for a man being painfully humiliated before their eyes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brother, what a screwball, what a sick man,'' muttered Albert
Navarrate, a jeweler from Queens, more in sadness than in anger,
after a particularly legalistic riff by Clinton outside News Corp.
``I mean he's a good president, he just screwed up. But children
shouldn't be exposed to this,'' he added, as the words ``oral sex''
echoed from the screen and flashed by again and again on the
electric ribbon above.
</P>
<P>
   Like Navarrate, most people listened a few minutes and moved on.
The shock value had long worn off, and everyone knew that the
testimony would be shown again and again all day, that the ordeal
was far from over. When a reporter approached one man and explained
that he was trolling for comments, the man wagged his head in
sympathy: ``Oh, I feel sorry for you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have already made up their minds, and what they're
seeing is only reinforcing their opinions,'' said the man, Thomas
Karle, a lawyer with McGraw Hill from Wilton, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   His opinion? ``I'm an attorney, and I view perjury and the
ability of the courts to punish it as the basis of law. It's all
sex and juicy, but it's still perjury.''
</P>
<P>
   At a retirement home in Seattle, residents expressed a grudging
respect for Clinton, at his ability to maintain control under hours
of questioning, but they also expressed a clear sadness that the
country was being put through such a spectacle. ``We live in a
different world these days, I guess,'' said Nancy Cadley, 77, a
retired nurse who served in a medical unit in World War II and the
Korean War.
</P>
<P>
   On the campus of Emory University in Atlanta, a group of six
students, who already had strong opinions on Clinton before the
video was released, saw its airing as just more embarrassment
heaped on the man, his office, and the nation he leads.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in New York, by far the more common reaction was sympathy
and even support for the president. Not absolution, certainly not
approval for what everyone agreed was gross and silly behavior, but
a sense that the public humiliation was out of all proportion to
his human weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad and cruel that he should go through this, that all
this should be made public,'' said a woman in her 30s. ``I don't
understand where they get the right to release this. It's
incredibly wrong. I mean, if the grand jury sat us all down and
asked about that topic, sex, how many people wouldn't commit
perjury?'' As if to punctuate the point, the woman resolutely
refused to give her name or job.
</P>
<P>
   In an admittedly unscientific sampling of street opinion, women
seemed more apt to show sympathy for the president than men.
</P>
<P>
   ``The political analysis I'm hearing during the breaks in the
coverage is contrary to my opinion,'' declared Joan Gilbert, a
public relations specialist. ``I am very sympathetic to Clinton. I
think he's being harassed and I think he is handling himself with
great diplomacy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He's apologized, hasn't he?'' said a woman waiting for a
flight at Newark Airport, who said she was 80 and gave her name
only as Anna. ``He's been a good president. I'm sick of it. It's
his own personal business what he did.''
</P>
<P>
   In Harlem, Deborah Campbell, a corrections officer from Queens,
echoed the sentiment over breakfast at Sylvia's Restaurant. ``In my
eyes it really doesn't matter. It's his personal life, and he's
doing a great job,'' she said. ``It shouldn't be shown on TV _ but
since it is, New Yorkers want to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all did. Dominic Romero, a chauffeur from White Plains, said
he was listening to the testimony only because he had nothing
better to do while waiting in his car outside the Colony Club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sick and tired of this,'' he said. ``I'm so disgusted with
Republicans and Democrats that I'm going to vote for a third party
next time. We've got no leader. We're the laughing stock of the
whole world.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those few who took a stern position toward the president,
like the attorney Karle, the usual reason was the public lies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clinton just dissembles too much,'' said David Pocock, a
music-festival director who watched the testimony at Newark Airport
while waiting for a flight to Indianapolis. ``When you see him on
television like this, it's just remarkable how smooth and slick he
can be. He's been too smooth and too slick for too long.''
</P>
<P>
   For all the drama on the screen, there was no sense across the
city that life had stopped, or even slowed, for the four-hour
broadcast. A random check of smokers outside office buildings
suggested that the only major obstacle to business-as-usual was the
Jewish holiday and the streets closed in midtown because of
Clinton's presence at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're too busy watching the market go down to watch the
president go down,'' said Bill Takos, while taking a break for a
smoke outside the Oscar Gruss brokerage.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   On Fifth Avenue nearby, Peter Katz was checking his window
display at the Alfred Dunhill shop. ``Watch TV? Of course not. I'm
at work,'' he declared with a note of indignation. ``I think when
you look at everything we're read and seen, the American public
would just as soon see the whole scenario end. It's not what the
American people want.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Borders book store on Fifth Avenue, signs everywhere
proclaimed, ``The Starr Report Is Here.'' But the latest
installment of the Clinton saga was not there. The television at
the espresso bar was showing another video, said John Hinte, a
manager at the store.
</P>
<P>
   ``I myself get information overload from the whole inquiry, the
whole rigmarole,'' he said. ``I'm a little overwhelmed by all this
information.'' But the Starr report, he admitted, was selling quite
briskly.
</P>
<P>
   At the Wiz, a large electronics store on Third Avenue, a wall of
television screens was showing an action movie. Only one 9-inch
screen at the end of the row was tuned, badly, to President
Clinton. ``The manager didn't want a crowd in here,'' explained a
salesman.
</P>
<P>
   Of the three people watching, only one said he had actually
dropped in for a quick gulp of testimony _ in the hope, he said, of
seeing Clinton get angry. ``We've had very few opportunities to see
Clinton showing strong emotions, and I read in The New York Times
that the tape could show that side of Clinton,'' explained Roberto
Sarmento, a manager of business planning with Philip Morris. He ran
out of time before Clinton got angry, but he said his wife was
taping the entire appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The manager at the Electronic Factory in the Bronx took the
opposite tack and tuned all his television sets to the president's
testimony. ``It's been on all morning, but customers aren't
interested,'' said the manager, J.D. Sabatt. ``Who cares? I've been
looking at his facial expressions, but really, it's because it's
the only channel that comes in clear.'' By noon, Sabatt said, he
had yet to sell a single set.
</P>
<P>
   A frequent refrain in the streets was concern that children were
being exposed to all the frank sex talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's interesting that whoever chose to release these
tapes chose the time when every child in America would be home from
school for the Jewish holiday,'' said Jeanne Pedro, watching the
testimony at her home in Mamaroneck. While most schoolchildren in
the nation were in classes on Monday, many children in the New York
region were out of school because of the holiday. ``I don't think
it's necessary for children to be listening to conversations about
oral sex and intercourse,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   But few adults themselves seemed shocked by what they heard, at
least not any more.
</P>
<P>
   On the TV at a coffee shop in Newark Airport, the president was
being questioned about where his secretary was during a visit from
Monica Lewinsky, when an elderly woman turned around and said for
all to hear, ``President Kennedy did worse!''
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he seems sincere and actually appealing,'' said Ruth
Finn, 78, a retired real-estate salesperson from Rye, after
watching the first two hours of testimony. ``Also, I don't see so
far what's so raunchy and graphic about this. Dan Rather gave a
warning at the outset, but so far, it seems fairly tame. The
average MTV video is far, far worse in terms of raunch and bad
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a psychological point of view, it's fascinating to see so
private a side of so public a person. His reactions, his responses
_ we're seeing something we're never seen before in a president.
It's really a historical moment.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like a drug,'' said Howard Enders, a professor of writing
at Purchase College. ``It keys into our own need to face the dark
side of ourselves _ if, indeed, we have to face it. Everyone says
they're sick of it, and then they go and watch it. We're watching a
drama unfold, a tragedy of Greek proportions. As I watched,'' he
added, ``I felt sympathy for Clinton.''

 MONTGOMERY CHIEF QUITS IN DISPUTE WITH NATIONSBANK 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By PETER TRUELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Thomas Weisel, one of the best-known investment bankers on the
U.S. West Coast, resigned Monday as chairman and chief executive of
Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities LLC after months of bitter
quarreling with his new bosses in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   The parent Nationsbank Corp. of Charlotte, N.C., the country's
third-largest bank, bought Weisel's company, Montgomery Securities
of San Francisco, for $1.2 billion last October to form Nationsbanc
Montgomery, as it sought to build itself a bigger and more
lucrative investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   Montgomery, which Weisel founded, grew rapidly in recent years,
particularly by acting as an investment banker in the
fastest-growing industries, like high technology and
telecommunications, including many Silicon Valley companies.
</P>
<P>
   But Nationsbank, with a button-down culture born in successful
commercial banking, and Weisel and his coterie, with a West Coast
entrepreneurial culture, almost immediately fell into squabbling
over who would run what at the newly formed Nationsbanc Montgomery.
</P>
<P>
   Weisel and his colleagues thought they had an agreement, as part
of the sale, that gave them the right to manage, from Montgomery's
San Francisco offices, specific areas of investment banking,
including high-yield bonds, equity investing and the business of
providing services to big investors like leveraged-buyout funds.
</P>
<P>
   Nationsbank, however, arguing that it was responding to changing
business conditions, wanted to manage such businesses more from
Charlotte as part of its overall banking business.
</P>
<P>
   It also maintained that it had the right to organize its
businesses after paying $1.2 billion to acquire Montgomery. Around
the same time, Nationsbank's top managers were becoming
increasingly preoccupied with trying to manage the huge-scale
acquisition of BankAmerica Corp., which was announced in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reason that I've resigned,'' Weisel said Monday, ``is that
we just have a difference over vision and strategy for the
organization.'' He declined to make any further comment about his
departure.
</P>
<P>
   Edward Brown III, Nationsbank's managing director for global
capital-raising and global markets, said: ``We are driven to have
investment banking businesses that are in sync with our whole
franchise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If we take a look at the power of our franchise, we will miss
him, but we will go forward,'' he said of Weisel. ``He was good at
attracting a very successful group of people who are joining our
team.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis Coleman, chief operating officer of the Montgomery
division of Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities, is expected to
succeed Weisel as chief executive, according to people at the
parent company and the investment bank.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to end the squabbling and to allow Weisel to
depart, Nationsbank also recently agreed to accelerate its payments
to him and to at least some of his partners from Montgomery. Under
the original agreement signed last year, these payments were to be
made over a three-year period. But according to Montgomery
executives, those payments are being made now.

UNCOVERED SHORT SALES RISE TO A RECORD ON THE BIG BOARD
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Open positions of short sales on the New York Stock
Exchange rose 2.6 percent last month, to a record 4.21 billion
shares, the exchange said Monday. On the smaller American Stock
Exchange, uncovered short sales fell seven-tenths of 1 percent, to
204.28 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   Uncovered short sales, or those with open positions, are those
shares that have been borrowed and sold, but not yet covered by
repurchase. If the share price falls, an investor can profit by
buying shares at a lower price to replace the borrowed ones.
</P>
<P>
   On the Big Board, the short-interest figure for the month ended
Sept. 15 was equal to 1.8 percent of the total shares listed on the
exchange. The total surpassed the previous record of 4.13 billion
shares in July. The August decline was the first monthly drop since
January.
</P>
<P>
   American International Group, the insurance and financial
services giant, showed the largest increase in short interest on
the Big Board, with the number of shares sold short more than
tripling, to 17,547,925.
</P>
<P>
   While high short-interest positions may indicate a rise in
bearish sentiments, short interest can also increase as a result of
complex trading strategies involving options, futures and other
stock-related derivatives.

EDITORIAL: RIPKEN FINALLY SITS ONE OUT 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times will say in an editorial for Tuesday, Sept.
22: &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   No matter how many home runs Mark McGwire or Sammy Sosa hits
this year, that record is going to be easier to match than Cal
Ripken's. On Sunday, Baltimore's indestructible infielder finally
scratched his name from the lineup after playing in 2,632
consecutive games, ending a streak that began early in Ronald
Reagan's first term, survived eight Oriole managers and continued
longer than most baseball careers.
</P>
<P>
   Ripken's record is important, though it takes a moment to figure
out why. It is obviously less meaningful _ in terms of skill and
fan-pleasing excitement _ than the home run record, or Joe
DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak. Ripken's accomplishment is more
mundane. He is the kid with the perfect attendance record, the guy
who shows up for work every day, the player you don't have to worry
about when everyone around him is complaining.
</P>
<P>
   That Ripken was good at his job simply adds another dimension to
his durability. A sure-handed shortstop, he was named the American
League's most valuable player twice and was selected for the
All-Star game 15 times. Ripken also helped rescue baseball from its
funk after a strike shortened the 1994 season. Interest in the game
revived as he began closing in on Lou Gehrig's mark of 2,130
consecutive games, and when he broke that record he inspired a
celebration not surpassed until McGwire set a new home run record
two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   As Ripken's range, power and speed diminished, he was switched
to third base, and there are those who argue he hung on too long in
a meaningless effort to pad a consecutive-game record that he had
already put out of reach. A more likely explanation is that he just
couldn't stand the idea of sitting on the bench.

MAGAZINE APPEARS ON LEWINSKY LIST  
 ADULT VIDEO STORE WITH STANDARDS  
 TEMPORARY HOME FOR THE HOLIDAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JAMES BARRON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ John F. Kennedy Jr. and his editors at George
magazine were surprised to learn Monday that George had been on
Monica Lewinsky's wish list of potential jobs in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   George was one possibility she mentioned in a note about her
aspirations that was described in the report Kenneth Starr sent to
Congress on Sept. 11. Among other choices, she said she would take
``anything at George magazine.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd certainly consider her,'' said Lisa Dallos, a spokeswoman
for the magazine. ``She's had a unique political experience.'' But
Ms. Dallos said that no one had approached the magazine about Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   In the note, Ms. Lewinsky also expressed interest in a job in
television. ``Kaplan _ CNN has a N.Y. Office,'' she wrote.
</P>
<P>
   This was apparently a reference to Rick Kaplan, who joined the
all-news network in August 1997 as president of CNN/U.S. Steve
Haworth, a spokesman for CNN, said that the network had not been
approached about finding a job for Ms. Lewinsky and would not
consider hiring her.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's note also mentioned ``news/political segments at
MTV.'' A spokeswoman for that network said she had been unaware of
Ms. Lewinsky's interest until a reporter called on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Adult Video Store With Standards
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ ``That's like a pornography thing, but with their
clothes on,'' said Ralph Testa, watching the president's grand jury
testimony from behind the counter at the Playpen, an adult-oriented
video store on Eighth Avenue near 45th Street.
</P>
<P>
   The picture on Testa's ceiling-mounted television was snowy _ it
was not connected to cable, which could have delivered clear
reception. But the sound was fine. The prosecutor's questions and
the president's answers were loud and clear, and Testa did not like
what he was hearing.
</P>
<P>
   ``My opinion, I think they should leave the man alone,'' Testa
said. ``Of course if he'd told it the way it was, he wouldn't have
this problem now.'' Testa said that most customers had paid little
attention to the president's testimony.
</P>
<P>
   Would Testa sell a videotape of the president's testimony if
copies were available? He paused and looked up at the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I would,'' he said. ``He's the president. I feel
it would be wrong to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Temporary Home For the Holidays
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Robert Isabell, the Manhattan party and floral
designer, relaxed Monday after creating a sanctuary for the Central
Synagogue inside the cavernous Seventh Regiment Armory on the Upper
East Side. The congregation, whose 126-year-old architectural
landmark home was badly damaged in a fire last month, celebrated
the first day of Rosh ha-Shannah in a temporary sanctuary that
looked anything but makeshift, what with the elaborate painted
backdrop that Isabell had installed in time for the Sunday night
service that opened the High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was an antique show in there 16 hours before our
service,'' he said, ``so we had 16 hours to transform the armory.
We had to do all the lighting and rigging and walls, and give it a
sense of a religious sanctuary. Everybody who was coming would feel
a sense of loss and mourning.''
</P>
<P>
   He filled the armory with 3,800 seats _ the synagogue's old
sanctuary seated only about 1,200 people _ in rows with
16-foot-wide aisles (city regulations required only 8-foot aisles,
he said, but he took no chances). He also arranged for
air-conditioning in the armory, which the congregation will use for
Yom Kippur services next week. Then Isabell's work will be stored
in a warehouse until next year, when it will be brought out again.
Repairs to the synagogue are expected to take two years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing was it was a little brighter than the original
Central Synagogue,'' Isabell said. ``Everybody always said it was
too dark to read the prayer books. We gave them a little more light
this time.''

PARCELLS SAYS FOLEY IS THE STARTER, BUT MUST PROVE HIMSELF
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Late last week, as the Jets prepared for their
meeting with the Indianapolis Colts, Bill Parcells sneaked up
behind Glenn Foley and delivered a blow to the quarterback's torn
rib cartilage. It was not a hard shot, just barely a touch, but
Foley said he nearly collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   To Parcells, that settled the issue of who was going to start at
quarterback. Vinny Testaverde got the assignment and delivered a
nearly flawless performance, throwing four touchdown passes to lead
the Jets to their first victory of the season after two defeats, a
44-6 rout of the hapless Colts.
</P>
<P>
   The steady handling of the team by Testaverde, a 12-year
veteran, raised a question as to whether he would remain as the
starter. Foley's most strenuous physical activity on Sunday came
when he raced onto the field to congratulate Testaverde on a
first-quarter touchdown pass.
</P>
<P>
   But Parcells quashed the notion of a quarterback controversy,
declaring after the game that if Foley was ready for the Jets' next
game, Oct. 4 against the Miami Dolphins, he would be the starter.
And while Parcells repeated that Monday, he also gave the same
message verbally that he had delivered to Foley physically with the
jab last week: Foley must prove he is ready on the field, not just
declare himself fit.
</P>
<P>
   Foley has mouthed the brave words before, including in the days
leading up to last season's finale against the Detroit Lions. He
could not play, though, and in the end Parcells had to give the
ball to Neil O'Donnell. The Jets lost, 13-10, and were knocked out
of a playoff berth.
</P>
<P>
   When informed that Foley said after Sunday's game that he would
be ready for the next game, Parcells said: ``I've heard that
before. There was no doubt before the Detroit game last year,
remember? I remember those things.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's what I look for: I've got to see he has enough
wherewithal to stand in there, throw the ball, and be willing to
take contact without the fear of that contact influencing how he's
going to perform. If I feel like the fear of that contact is going
to influence how he's going to perform, I'm going to take the other
guy and play him in the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not about how the ball flies spiral-wise. It's when
somebody runs into him, what happens? Can he take it or can't he
take it? If he can take it, he's going to play. If he can't take
it, he's not going to play and I'll use him in spot duty.``
</P>
<P>
   With the team just meeting Monday, not practicing, and then
taking a day off on Tuesday, Foley's word is all Parcells has for
now. But beginning Wednesday, Foley will have seven days of
practice to prove to his coach that he can do the job, at least
soothed by words of support from Parcells, even if the physical jab
stung.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's gotten a lot better,'' Foley said of the pain in his
ribs. ``Bill tested it the other day when he came up behind me and
gave me a little rap on the side to test it and see how it was. I
nearly collapsed. He just wanted to make sure I wasn't faking it.
He said, `I guess you're not ready.'
</P>
<P>
   ``If we would have practiced today, I think I could practice.
But again, we've got a couple days here to relax, let it heal up a
little more, and then go out in practice and see how it is.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Until it is proven to Parcells that Foley can perform at a
higher level than Testaverde can, the assignment is up for grabs.
The notion that a starter cannot lose a job to injury is not part
of Parcells' beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what my quarterback plans are yet, really,
because I don't know what the facts are yet,'' Parcells said.
``When I find out all the facts, I can make the plans. Now we've
discussed about three or four hypothetical situations and I told
you, if everything is status quo and everyone is healthy, then I'm
going to play Glenn in the game and that's the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look, I'm going to need both of these guys throughout the
course of the season. There isn't any doubt about it. Just look
around the league. Everybody's doing it. It's just like last week,
we needed the guy and he came through and he did heck of a job. He
threw four touchdown passes, he made good decisions, and didn't do
anything to hurt us. I was very pleased with that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, I'm more fortunate than most coaches that you have
a guy like this who's experienced and has talent and you can put in
the game and he can do something for you. I'm glad I got the guy. I
like the guy personally. He works hard. He's a diligent preparation
guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens, but I don't have the facts at this
moment. I don't know how Foley's going to be. I've got to see
myself that everything is good with Foley. I can't just hear it.
I've got to see it.''

COMMENTARY: WHERE Y2K IS NOTHING BUT THREE KEYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By CLYDE HABERMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You have probably already read, and you can expect to
read a lot more in coming months, about something called Y2K.
Sounds like the secret ingredient for a miracle hair restorer.
Actually, it is a problem that is supposed to leave all us moderns
quaking in our Nikes, but has to bring a smile to anyone with mild
Luddite tendencies.
</P>
<P>
   Y2K is shorthand for the programming bug that will prevent
zillions of computers from recognizing the year 2000 when it comes
around because they were weaned on a two-digit system for dates.
This year, for instance, is rendered simply as 98, with the 19
assumed. Expectations are that many machines will go cross-eyed
with the approaching double-ought rollover, believing that we are
back in 1900 and not in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Terrible consequences have been predicted, from airplanes
falling out of the sky to investment portfolios being wiped out.
But even if you are among those who suspect the world will somehow
muddle through, you have to sneer at a technology that lacks the
sense God gave a desk calendar.
</P>
<P>
   Martin Tytell had to laugh. Y2K? ``To tell you the truth,'' he
said the other day, ``it doesn't bother me at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it doesn't. Computers are meaningless to Tytell, who
at 85 is one of the few remaining typewriter repairmen in New York
City. ``A dying breed,'' he will tell you. But dying is not dead,
and this breed is not ready for its obituary, not yet.
</P>
<P>
   Tytell has been building and repairing typewriters for 70 years,
the last 30 in a crowded shop up a flight from Fulton Street in
lower Manhattan. In his bow tie and white lab coat, a pen planted
in the breast pocket, he is master of a realm of cogs and key caps,
of rollers and ribbons, all competing for space with hundreds of
typewriters in English, German, Russian, Greek, Hebrew, Arabic,
Farsi, you name it.
</P>
<P>
   Every few years, someone with a pen and note pad climbs the
stairs to see how this throwback to the precomputer age is getting
along. The visitor is always rewarded with grand tales of how
Tytell and his wife, Pearl, verified documents by the typewriters
that were used, how during World War II they built machines in 145
languages for the U.S. Army, how an upside-down letter in Burmese
inadvertently installed by Tytell became the accepted standard for
all Burmese typewriters.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose of the journey this time was to see if computers had
finally dealt typewriters a fatal blow. Happily, the answer was no.
</P>
<P>
   Young people, women in particular for some reason, have shown
new interest in the old machines, Tytell said. ``Some gal graduated
from Barnard, and her family decided to make her a present of the
typewriter that her grandma used, with Champagne and everything,''
he said. ``Something's going on there.''
</P>
<P>
   As he talked, a young man from Brooklyn carried in a slightly
battered Mercedes Selecta, an antique manual typewriter that he had
bought at a yard sale as a gift for his girlfriend, an aspiring
author. ``She wants to write with the same tools Hemingway wrote
with,'' the Brooklyn man explained.
</P>
<P>
   Some writers _ no names mentioned _ come to the shop when words
fail them, having convinced themselves that the fault lies not in
the stars but in the typewriter. ``They tell me that the machine is
not responding properly, even when it is in perfect shape,'' Tytell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Who is to say they are wrong? Certainly not Tytell, who believes
that typewriters have a soul, unlike you know what.
</P>
<P>
   Is there any question which kind of machine is healthier for
you? In the typewriter's heyday, you never heard about mass
outbreaks of repetitive stress injury, or about eyestrain from
staring too long at blinking images.
</P>
<P>
   Typewriters also fostered mental health. Nothing relieved a
struggling writer's frustration like ripping the paper out of the
roll and crumpling it. Think of all the computer weirdos you read
about these days, like the cybercultists who committed mass suicide
last year. You never had anything like that with the Smith-Corona
crowd.
</P>
<P>
   As for durability, don't waste breath making comparisons. ``You
show me the computer that's going to last 15 years,'' Tytell said.
``But with these'' _ his hand swept across a row of old Olympias _
``you wipe them off and they're good for another 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   And he expects to be around to nurse them, if not for decades
then certainly beyond the irrelevant Y2K.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ When James Dickey _ the hard-drinking, hard-living
Southern poet and novelist _ died of liver disease in 1997, his son
Christopher forgot everything he had ever known about his father.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a very strange thing,'' the younger Dickey said,
sipping a cup of unsweetened tea (orange pekoe) at the Algonquin
Hotel last week. (He had asked for honey to soothe a bad case of
book-tour throat, but the newly reopened Algonquin could only offer
unsatisfying pink packets of Sweet 'n Low.)
</P>
<P>
   ``My memory completely blanked out,'' he said. ``But it's not
unique to me. I got an e-mail from a friend who had worked in the
same law office with his father for 20 years. And when his father
died, he said he looked at the desk where his father used to sit
and it was suddenly as if the only memory he had left was of a
cut-out silhouette he could hang on the wall.''
</P>
<P>
   But Dickey, who is the Paris bureau chief for Newsweek, had been
working with his father, taping their conversations for two years
before his death to put together some sort of memoir. The resulting
book is the younger Dickey's ``Summer of Deliverance: A Memoir of
Father and Son,'' published by Simon &AMP; Schuster this month.
</P>
<P>
   During their conversations, they talked about ``Deliverance,''
the novel that the senior Dickey published in 1971 and that was
turned into a movie in which he got to play the sheriff. They
talked about the elder Dickey's infidelities (many) and habitual
lying (like when he told his children he had once been married to a
woman who died, a story he later admitted he made up) and awards
(he won the National Book Award for his fourth book of poems) and
brave moments (rescuing Christopher's brother, Kevin, from a ski
lift) and writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had really gone back to be reconciled with him,'' Dickey
said. ``To try to reconcile myself with him. And you know you just
can't go home and walk in the door and say, `Hi, Dad, let's get
along.' So it seemed that working on a book together would be a way
to go back over our lives and talk and reach that point where
you're not just talking but make some real contact.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many literary families, the Dickeys _ who included Maxine,
Christopher's mother, and another son, Kevin, a radiologist who
teaches at Yale _ suffered because their lives became fodder for
James Dickey's writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Roughly two-thirds of my father's poems are about fathers and
sons,'' Dickey said. For an interview after an appearance on the
``Today'' show and before one on ``The Charlie Rose Show,'' Dickey
wore khakis, a blue blazer and an Hermes tie printed with zebras.
``My father was literally in the business of imagining himself and
imagining us from before the time we were born. Look, my father was
describing me as `the parricidal vision from the loin' while I was
still in my mother's womb.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Dickey was born on Aug. 31, 1951, in Nashville. His
father moved the family to Texas, France, Italy, Florida,
California, Georgia, South Carolina, Mississippi _ wherever he
could teach or write or take advantage of a fellowship.
</P>
<P>
   But James Dickey's infidelities, his son said, cursed the
marriage. ``Our life was so public,'' he said. ``It's not as if my
father was a CEO and we were leading sheltered private lives that
anybody was talking about outside the country club. That's not the
way we ever lived our lives. I just got a letter the other day from
another woman who said she was his mistress in Atlanta. And she
said _ oh, you know, something like: `It was a great experience
knowing him. He was a wonderful man. Yes, he got drunk. Yes, he was
difficult.' And you know, I've gotten several of those kinds of
letters.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the rocky times at home and the moving, Christopher got
through Exeter, married at 18 and graduated from the University of
Virginia before going to The Washington Post. In 1976, Maxine
Dickey died at 50. Christopher was unprepared for her death, but
even less prepared for his father's marriage two months later to a
recent acquaintance, Deborah Dodson.
</P>
<P>
   That tormented marriage _ they were both alcoholics and at times
the sons feared for their father's life _ drove his sons away. In
the meantime, Christopher got divorced and began to write about
wars, terrorism, the contras. He remarried. He drifted away from
his father. He became Newsweek's Cairo bureau chief; he wrote a
couple of nonfiction books and a novel.
</P>
<P>
   Then, two years before his death, James Dickey stopped drinking.
He divorced his wife. And Christopher started talking to him again.
``He wanted to stop playing these endless mind games,'' Dickey
said. ``When he was dying, when I was helping him up and down the
stairs with his oxygen generator, and he would say, `You know you
could construct a whole book out of just the dialogue on these
landings.'''
</P>
<P>
   Dickey had two reasons for the book: First, it was a form of
survival. Journalist to the core, Dickey needed to record the
events happening before him. ``That exercise of him going up and
down the stairs and being in such terrible condition was hard to
know what to do with,'' he said. ``Except take notes, to do
something that could give me a little bit of distance.''
</P>
<P>
   The other reason: He loved his father. He misses him. ``I wanted
to bring him back,'' he said, his voice low. ``I wanted to write
about him with affection and honesty and love. I want him to live
on the page.''

A BLEAK SPACE IS COLORIZED FOR PRAYER 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By BARBARA STEWART   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ At 2 a.m. Sunday, just 18 hours before the start of
the Jewish new year and the High Holy Days, volunteers from Central
Synagogue entered the vast, bleak space of the empty 7th Regiment
Armory on the Upper East Side.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes before, an antiques show had moved out, ending its run a
day early to accommodate the congregation and its plan to turn the
airplane-hangar-sized armory into a place filled with warmth,
color, calm and spirituality before sundown.
</P>
<P>
   The Jewish new year was observed by the thousands of synagogues
throughout the city. And for the third consecutive year, Temple
Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue put a shortened Rosh Hashana service on
the Internet, beginning at noon on Sunday to coincide with sundown
in Israel, said Mark Weissguch, the synagogue's administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Many members of Central Synagogue struggled with feelings of
loss and trepidation at the approach of the High Holy Days. Three
weeks ago, a fire heavily damaged their 126-year-old synagogue, an
architectural treasure on Lexington Avenue and 55th Street in
midtown Manhattan, and Gov. George Pataki ordered a state of
emergency to allow the congregation to use the New York State
Armory for the High Holy Days.
</P>
<P>
   As one congregant said, ``I didn't have any idea what to
expect.''
</P>
<P>
   But at the end of Monday's morning service, the majority said
they were more than satisfied by the transformation. Somehow, they
said, Robert Isabell, who designs expensive parties and receptions,
had managed to create in the huge, bleak space at 66th Street and
Park Avenue an atmosphere conducive to prayer and penitence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Very sacred,'' said Paul Koren, an accountant.
</P>
<P>
   ``It felt holy,'' said Marlin Potash, a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   But creating a contemplative feeling required 16 hours of
``impressive chaos,'' said Livia Thompson, Central Synagogue's
administrator. Because the antiques show did not begin to vacate
the armory until Saturday at midnight, the Isabell design staff and
volunteers began working at 2 o'clock on Sunday morning and did not
quit until 7 o'clock that night.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday morning, when congregants entered the armory, they saw
a gigantic deep-red space with a stage and a towering backdrop that
was painted to resemble the familiar, dazzling colors and intricate
patterns of the original synagogue's Moorish designs. The rabbi, at
the fire-damaged lectern, was framed in a wooden arch. In the back,
a slide of the synagogue's rose window was projected on the wall.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly nobody mistook it for the original, but while many
congregants said they missed the glorious art of Central Synagogue,
they also said they felt comforted by the presence of one another.
The synagogue building could accommodate only 1,000 people. In the
armory, for the first time in memory, all 3,000 or so members could
pray together. And many expressed gratitude for the help of the
hundreds who had created the makeshift synagogue.
</P>
<P>
   At the last minute, the workers discovered that a donated ark _
which contains the Torahs, the temple's most sacred objects _ could
not be used. The workers had a half-hour to create and erect
another ark, Ms. Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Schlechter, a congregant coordinating the work, ran out
and bought curtain rods. The five Torahs were placed on chairs and
enclosed in red curtains, she said.
</P>
<P>
   The result, said Robert Friedman, a congregant and the president
of New Line Cinema's television operation, was a ``space that
works, but feels different _ dynamic. There's a specialness.
Everyone is coming through this together.''

A SUCCESS STORY DEFENDS HIS LIGHTWEIGHT TITLE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Shane Mosley, the International Boxing Federation
lightweight champion, is the antithesis of everything that is wrong
with boxing. He is a superbly talented boxer who fights all comers.
He gets along great with his father, Jack, who is also his manager
and trainer. And he is a good citizen whose name does not end up on
a police blotter once a month.
</P>
<P>
   And what has all that got Mosley? The title of the best
pound-for-pound fighter no one has heard of, even though he has
held his title since defeating Phillip Holiday on Aug. 2, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't create havoc or have any adversity in my life,''
Mosley said. ``Maybe that's what I have to do to get some
recognition. But I can't, because that's not who I am. This sport
needs success stories, and I feel I am successful. I'm a world
champion and I've accomplished the goals that I've set out to
accomplish.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley, of Pomona, Calif., will headline a show at the Theater
at Madison Square Garden Tuesday night. It will be broadcast by
TNT. Mosley (28-0) will meet Eduardo Morales of Argentina (26-0) in
a 12-round title bout in the cable network's first foray into
boxing. Two junior lightweights, Angel Manfredy (24-2-1) of Gary,
Ind., and John Brown (18-4) of Atlantic City, will meet on the
undercard.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have not seen Mosley fight on HBO's ``Boxing After
Dark,'' this will be an opportunity to see one of the brightest
young boxers on the scene today and still get a good night's sleep.
Although on the West Coast Mosley is lost in the vast shadow of
Oscar De La Hoya, the World Boxing Council welterweight champion,
his profile has risen in the East. He has defended his title in
Atlantic City and in Philadelphia and has fought twice on the same
card as another brilliant young boxer, junior middleweight David
Reid.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was walking up 125th Street the other day and this guy said,
`Hey, I can't believe the champ was going to walk right past me and
not say anything,''' Mosley said of a recent stroll in Harlem.
``That has never happened in Los Angeles. Even some of the police
officers here recognized me. That really surprised me. I feel like
an East Coast fighter. I get a lot of ink and a lot of hype here.
People here are very excited about the way that I fight.''
</P>
<P>
   There should be plenty of excitement and few surprises in the
ring tonight against Morales, whom Mosley described as a technical
fighter. ``He relies on his left hook a lot,'' Mosley said. ``He
doesn't give you any feints or razzle-dazzle.''
</P>
<P>
   While they were in Manhattan to promote the fight, Mosley and
Morales worked out at the Kingsway Boxing Center. Last Wednesday
their workouts overlapped. Mosley was finishing up his workout,
while Morales was just beginning. Mosley and his father watched
Morales spar. Typically, boxers do not want the opposing camp to
see what they are working on. But Mosley's presence did not seem to
bother Morales.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was kind of strange,'' Mosley said. ``But he really didn't
show anything that we haven't seen on tape from his last fight. He
wasn't really teeing off on his sparring partner or anything. He
really wasn't showing anything. He is a hard puncher, which his 24
knockouts show.''
</P>
<P>
   Mosley is also a hard puncher, with an affinity for working the
body. He has power in both hands. His footwork is magnificent, and
he can throw dazzling combinations. If he ever decides to get a
shtick, he will be sensational, because, right now, he has all the
moves.

UCLA REVAMPS SECONDARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Two days after Houston's second-class offense
gained 442 yards and scored 24 points against UCLA, the Bruins
revamped their sagging secondary, moving All-American Larry Atkins
while benching Marques Anderson and Eric Whitfield.
</P>
<P>
   Only junior cornerback Jason Bell was left untouched in the
purge.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well on defense,'' coach Bob Toledo said
Monday. ``If you're not playing well, you have to look beyond the
wins and get things corrected before something else happens.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins switched Atkins from strong safety to free safety,
where he replaces Whitfield, now a reserve cornerback.
Traditionally, strong safety is a run-support position, while free
safety defends the pass and roams the defensive backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Atkins) hasn't had the opportunity to make as many plays as
we'd like,'' Toledo said. ``By moving him, he'll be involved in
more plays.''
</P>
<P>
   Fifth-year senior Tod McBride will replace Atkins at strong
safety. A former receiver, McBride switched to safety last year and
is fully recovered from operations on both patellar tendons. He's
not the fastest man for the job, but he's the most physical.
</P>
<P>
   ``He deserves the opportunity to see what he can do,'' Toledo
said. ``He has waited his turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Ryan Roques, who was burned for one touchdown Saturday but
scored another, has replaced Anderson as the starting left
cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Anderson) did not play well at all,'' Toledo said in his most
stinging critique of a player this season. ``He didn't show a lot
of intensity. He didn't cover guys. He didn't tackle guys. Somebody
else deserves a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Dirty tricks? He kept quiet immediately following the game, but
two days and 2,000 miles later, Bruins quarterback Cade McNown
loosed a blistering attack on Houston's sportsmanship and stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt they played us dirty,'' McNown said. ``They had a lot
of cheap shots. They were going for our knees. They had late hits,
intentional stuff that doesn't have any place in college football.
</P>
<P>
   ``The (Robertson Stadium) field was a joke. It was terrible.
There were sprinkler heads sticking up; I felt for (kicker) Chris
Sailer. It was like a fairgrounds. As soon as the venue shifted
from the Astrodome, we should have dropped them.''
</P>
<P>
   McNown said he tripped on uneven field before the game and
believes that may have caused Freddie Mitchell's broken leg.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before the tackle he starts to run unevenly, and there was a
huge dip next to our sideline,'' McNown said.
</P>
<P>
   Toledo refrained from criticizing Houston, instead directing his
ire at the Conference USA officials. ``The control of the game was
very poor,'' he said. ``We lost our poise, and they tried to
intimidate us.... But in (Houston coach) Kim Helton's defense, he
was irate after the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Other changes: In all, the Bruins will have new starters at six
positions for Saturday's game at Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Glendale College transfer James Ghezzi has replaced Leona
Valley's Matt Phelan at left guard. Both are playing for starter
Oscar Cabrera, who's out at least a week with a sprained ankle.
</P>
<P>
   In an effort to spark the Mitchell-less receiving corps, Brian
Poli-Dixon will start at split end. Former starter Brad Melsby is
the No. 2 flanker behind Danny Farmer.
</P>
<P>
   With Kenyon Coleman out 3-4 weeks (sprained knee), Travor Turner
is the new starter at defensive end. Turner, dubbed the Sack Master
by teammates, had seven tackles against Houston and was named
UCLA's defensive player of the week.

ON PRO FOOTBALL: LET STEWART BE SLASH 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By THOMAS GEORGE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; MIAMI _ Kordell Stewart did not field questions after Pittsburgh
was dusted by Miami, 21-0, here on Sunday. He made a statement
about how his team was not at its best, how the offense did not
click, how his team got socked, how it is early in the season and
how changes need to be made. But no questions, please.
</P>
<P>
   Good enough.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart knew what was coming after he passed for 3 yards in the
first half and then 82 for the game, spiced with three
interceptions, one that led to a Miami offensive touchdown and
another that the Miami defense returned for a touchdown. He knew
what was coming after an afternoon at quarterback where he looked
harried and distracted and plucked.
</P>
<P>
   Questions like these:
</P>
<P>
   Kordell, what went wrong?
</P>
<P>
   Kordell, was this one bad game or the real you?
</P>
<P>
   Kordell, will the offense lose faith in you?
</P>
<P>
   Kordell, Kordell, Kordell.
</P>
<P>
   It happened, anyway. Stewart could not be asked, but it did not
stop those type of questions from being floated at the rest of the
Steelers, and particularly at running back Jerome Bettis.
</P>
<P>
   Jerome, do you think this team is losing confidence in Kordell?
</P>
<P>
   Bettis answered: ``No, not at all. It's just a situation where
we could not get anything going, that's all, and it happens like
that. We just have to go back and look at what we can do to take
the pressure off him, that's all.''
</P>
<P>
   There is, indeed, pressure on Kordell Stewart. His team is 2-1,
has struggled mightily on offense and has the unbeaten, high-flying
Seattle Seahawks (3-0) visiting on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Pressure is evident on every National Football League
quarterback. Among them, Gus Frerrote in Washington and Scott
Mitchell in Detroit lost their starting jobs after one and two
weeks worth of games, respectively. Bobby Hoying is learning brutal
lessons in his first season as the Philadelphia starter. Rookie
Ryan Leaf won his first two games in San Diego and then made
1-of-15 passes (14 consecutive incompletions), fumbled three times
and was intercepted twice against Kansas City on Sunday. Rookie
Peyton Manning in Indianapolis looks awfully ordinary in the Colts'
awful 0-3 start, the latest a 44-6 drubbing by the Jets on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, though, has pressures external and internal that
differ. He is only 25 and has made only 23 regular-season starts.
But he produced early success and now he is expected to routinely
produce. Never mind the growing pains. He has done it. So, keep
doing it.
</P>
<P>
   Or else the pressure swells. The whispers start. All of that old
garbage about a black quarterback and his thinking in the pocket
starts to surface. All of the trash about him being a scrambler and
not a passer rises.
</P>
<P>
   It is a no-win battle. So, Stewart must win to win. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are two elements in the Pittsburgh loss to Miami that the
Steelers must recognize to bolster Stewart's confidence. First,
don't allow him to be boxed in the pocket. Second, script a handful
of running plays for him each game.
</P>
<P>
   What earned Stewart his nickname Slash was that he could rush
the football, play receiver and play quarterback.
Runner/receiver/quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   But Pittsburgh played into Miami's hands and allowed Stewart to
be limited primarily to pocket passing. This was a mistake,
especially back near the Steelers' own goal line, where Stewart was
trying to throw from the pocket over the middle into a layered zone
pass defense and was intercepted by Miami linebacker Zach Thomas
for a 17-yard touchdown return. It would be a lot to ask of Joe
Montana and Joe Namath in their prime, let alone Stewart, to read
that kind of defense and throw the ball into the middle of the
field under pressure.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   No, Stewart is better on the edges. A few more rollouts and
rotating pockets. What strikes fear in a defense is his mobility.
He needs to be outside the pocket frequently so that defenses are
struck with a bewildering question: Will he run or will he throw?
That moment of indecisiveness by the defense makes Stewart a better
passer and the offense a stronger threat. There was no reason that
Pittsburgh should have allowed Miami to put Stewart in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Stewart needs to run it more. Some think this opens a
can of worms, but, really, it opens more possibilities for the
Pittsburgh offense.
</P>
<P>
   In the second quarter, after Miami was up by 14-0, Pittsburgh
faced a third-and-3 from its own 26. Stewart took the ball, rolled
right and easily dashed for 13 yards. First down. Out of a total of
60 Pittsburgh plays, he ran the ball only once more, for 4 yards.
He needs about five scripted runs a game. This helps keep defenses
on their heels. It makes them respect the running threat and
loosens the passing lanes. So what if people think he has become
more of a scrambler than a passer?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Stewart and the Steelers are sensitive. Both want everyone to
know he is a quarterback, a passer, first, and a scrambler, a
runner, occasionally. Both fight him being stereotyped, being put
in a box.
</P>
<P>
   Better that happen in perception than in reality.

MALONE NOT LOOKING FOR NO. 1 PITCHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Dodgers won't be seeing right-hander Kevin
Brown in their upcoming series with the San Diego Padres, and it is
probably for the best.
</P>
<P>
   Not only is Brown a leading candidate for the National League Cy
Young Award, he and Houston's Randy Johnson are the two top
pitchers in this winter's free-agent market.
</P>
<P>
   Although Dodgers players say privately that acquiring a No. 1
starter should be the club's top offseason priority, new general
manager Kevin Malone says that isn't going to happen. Malone, whose
task of rebuilding the Dodgers is complicated by $53 million
already committed to 12 players, said it is not realistic to sign a
top pitcher to a multi-year contract worth $10 million when
pitching is not the club's most glaring weakness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't like to put labels on pitchers, No. 1 or No. 2 or No.
3,'' Malone said. ``I think we have a strong starting staff right
now, and adding to that might not be the best use of our resources.
I'd much rather have five No. 2s than a No. 1, three No. 4s and a
(No.) 5.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers will go with Chan Ho Park in tonight's series opener
against the Padres. Since Dodgers ace Ramon Martinez was lost in
early June with a torn right rotator cuff, Park has been as close
as anyone to a No. 1 starter on the club.
</P>
<P>
   In his last three starts, Park has thrown 136 pitches twice and
137 in last Tuesday's 5-4 loss to Colorado. He has back-to-back
complete games, which has taken pressure off the Dodgers' tired and
injured bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   But he has not been overpowering the way he was during stretches
of last season, when he tied Hideo Nomo for the club lead with 14
victories.
</P>
<P>
   Left-hander Carlos Perez has four consecutive complete-game
victories, the most since Orel Hershiser in 1988. He also has two
shutouts during that span and sounds as if he wants the No. 1 job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can be a leader of the pitching staff,'' Perez said after
beating the San Francisco Giants 1-0 on Sunday. ``I learned a lot
watching (Cy Young winner) Pedro Martinez last year (in Montreal).
It took a few starts to get comfortable here, but I feel I am right
where I want to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Mark Grudzielanek, who came over with Perez from the
Montreal Expos in a July 31 trade, is not sure Perez fits the mold
of a true No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I think of an ace, I think of one of those hard-throwing
right-handers like Roger Clemens or a Kevin Brown or a Ramon
Martinez,'' Grudzielanek said. ``Guys who are there to take the
ball. That is not a knock on any of our guys. We have pitchers who
could step up to be that guy someday.''
</P>
<P>
   Many in the organization are hoping that guy will one day be
right-hander Darren Dreifort. Although he lost 12 games and will
miss the final three weeks with a sore shoulder, Dreifort struck
out 168 in 180 innings during his first year in the rotation.
</P>
<P>
   Before this year, Dreifort never pitched more than 63 innings in
a season. He is eligible for salary arbitration this winter.
Dreifort earned $685,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Mlicki and Brian Bohanon, acquired from the New York Mets
in separate deals, have been impressive. Mlicki will earn $2.25
million in 1999. Bohanon is a free agent. With all the money
already locked up, and with Grudzielanek, catcher Charles Johnson
and pitcher Ismael Valdes eligible for salary arbitration, Bohanon
probably would get a better contract on the open market.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves Valdes, who couldn't get out of the third inning in
Saturday's 18-4 loss to the Giants. He pitched well in three starts
after coming off the disabled list, but there still are concerns
about his grit during games.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers were worried enough about Valdes not reaching his
potential that they tried to package him last June in a deal with
Seattle. The Mariners wanted Dreifort.
</P>
<P>
   For a No. 1 starter named Randy Johnson. &QL;

GRIFFITH JOYNER WAS AN INSPIRATION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By YVETTE CABRERA  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NORTHRIDGE _ Hanging in Barbara Swerkes' Cal State Northridge
office is a framed Sports Illustrated cover photo of her former
track star, Florence Griffith Joyner.
</P>
<P>
   In her eight years as women's track coach at Northridge, Swerkes
trained some of the brightest stars to emerge in American track
history, including Olympians Valerie Brisco-Hooks, Jeannette Bolden
and Pam Spencer-Marquez.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it was Griffith Joyner, who died early Monday of an apparent
heart seizure at age 38, who captured a special place in Swerkes'
heart for her fierce determination to succeed, her work ethic and a
fun-loving attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a very classy girl _ I can't believe she's gone,''
said Swerkes, who is now a professor of kinesiology.
</P>
<P>
   As to whether Griffith Joyner was able to inspire others,
Swerkes said: ``Absolutely _ for setting goals, being able to
achieve them and being an individual. Florence was always an
individual.''
</P>
<P>
   In the two years she spent at CSUN before transferring to UCLA,
Griffith Joyner set two school records and helped lead her team to
two national championships, in 1979 and '80.
</P>
<P>
   A business major, Griffith Joyner wasn't even among the
university's top four sprinters her first year. But she persisted
and predicted she would one day be as good as her teammates,
according to her former coach. ``She never had any arrogance about
her. Never,'' said Swerkes. ``It was just a determination.''
</P>
<P>
   By her sophomore year, Griffith Joyner was a member of the
400-meter relay team that broke the national record with a time of
44.10 seconds. Griffith Joyner holds CSUN's fifth-fastest time in
the 100 meters at 11.54, set in 1980, as well as the fourth-fastest
time in the 200 meters, 24.04, set in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   She also recorded the fastest time in school history as part of
the 800 medley relay team, which set a record of 1:40.04 in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   In those years, Griffith Joyner may have lived in the shadows of
her more famous teammates, but she always stood out as the sharp
dresser and the fun-loving teammate who ``everyone enjoyed being
with,'' said Swerkes.
</P>
<P>
   Even before she captured the world's attention with her bold,
colorful one-legged bodysuits, Griffith Joyner was busy attracting
the hearts of male athletes. Swerkes remembers the time when a box
of long-stem roses was waiting for Griffith Joyner at her hotel
before a competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the male athletes on the University of Oregon team had
left them there for her as a welcome to Oregon,'' said Swerkes.
``She always attracted a lot of attention. That was pretty
(characteristic) of Florence.''
</P>
<P>
   During her time at CSUN, Griffith Joyner took classes in
Pan-African and Chicano studies, kinesiology and psychology,
according to records from the College of Business Administration
and Economics.
</P>
<P>
   ``The world lost just a tremendous person and role model,'' said
Pan African studies professor Johnie Scott, who like Griffith
Joyner gradated from Jordan High in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Having grown up in Watts to become a gold-medal Olympian,
Griffith Joyner was a source of inspiration for young
African-American people and for young women in general, said Scott,
who met her only once during a social function. ``She was not only
a world-class athlete, she was a world-class human being,'' said
Scott.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-'80s, Griffith Joyner and her husband, 1984 Olympic
triple-jump gold medalist Al Joyner, lived in Van Nuys, where the
couple would train by taking moonlight runs and early morning
conditioning runs down Woodley Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, as news of Griffith Joyner's death spread throughout
CSUN's Athletic Department, officials scrambled to find photographs
of her time on campus but couldn't find any snapshots of the woman
nicknamed ``lightning'' by her family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess she was just too fast, they couldn't catch her on
film,'' said Ryan Finney, CSUN's sports information director. ``Her
death is a huge loss for not only the track and field community,
but for all of America.''

 &HT;    Players back coach after tough Bengal loss
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ While Bruce Coslet was being crucified on a sports
talk-radio station Monday, Bengals players stood behind their coach
in the wake of Sunday's 13-6 loss to the Green Bay Packers.
</P>
<P>
   Trailing 10-3 just before intermission, Coslet ordered an option
play that failed on third-and-goal at the Packers' 1-yard line,
then _ instead of going for a TD _ Doug Pelfrey kicked a 19-yard
field goal.
</P>
<P>
   Coslet said the option should have resulted in a Jeff Blake TD.
There was only one problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We missed a key block or we walk in. It's just simple,'' he
said. ``(The Packers) were poorly deployed to even attempt to stop
that play. It didn't work because of a missed block. We have
everybody else sealed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Pelfrey, ``You've got to play the percentages and that's
what Bruce was doing. If we would have left at halftime and not
gotten those three points, that would have been more demoralizing
than getting the three points.''
</P>
<P>
   Fullback Brian Milne said, ``You can't second-guess your head
coach. You have to be one as a team, do what he says and go from
there. It was the right decision, especially if you don't make (a
touchdown) in the first three shots.''
</P>
<P>
   Coslet kept his composure, refusing to lash out at the tidal
wave of criticism against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some were saying (the field goal) was because I had no
confidence in our offense,'' Coslet said. ``Not true. It's that I
had confidence in our defense. I told the defense that at halftime.
I said: `Defense this is why I took the three. I have confidence in
you. You're playing 'em tough. Keep it up.'
</P>
<P>
   ``When you have a chance to put points on the board against the
Packers, you better do it. Sure, it would have been nice to get a
touchdown. But you've got to understand the ramifications of let's
say we go for it and don't make it. Now we get no points. So you
pick and choose. That's what I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Second guess me all you want. I really don't mind that. That's
your prerogative. But you have to know all the preparation that
goes into getting ready for an opponent like this, the struggles we
did have up to that point offensively and how well our defense was
playing. I'd do it again.''

 &HT;    Q and A with Evander Holyfield
 &HT;    By Jeff Schultz
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Evander Holyfield spoke with Atlanta
Journal-Constitution staff writer Jeff Schultz for nearly two hours
at the boxer's estate in Fairburn, Ga. on Sunday night about the
recent birth of two out-of-wedlock children, infidelity and the
difficulties of his marriage. Also present was Holyfield's
attorney, Jim Thomas.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What led to your infidelity during your current marriage and
the births of two other children?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wasn't happy with the decision I made to get married. After
the fight against Mike Tyson (in 1996), I talked to my pastor
(Creflo Dollar). He said I need to work at it, but I was still very
confused. I wondered if I just wanted to get out of the marriage.
During that period of time, when I was down, both of these women
got pregnant. When each woman told me, I told Janice, but she
didn't want to leave me. So we continued to go to counseling.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How long had you been going to counseling?
</P>
<P>
   A: Since just after the Tyson fight (one month after the
marriage). Then when the other two women got pregnant, I told
Janice we could just quietly get out of the marriage before the
babies were born because I was concerned she would be humiliated
and the grief she was gonna get. One thing I realized was, I was
going to take care of the kids even though I didn't intend to have
them. I knew I would be there for the kids. I tried to get her to
see that it would be a good reason for her to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Did it surprise you that Janice wanted to stay married?
</P>
<P>
   A: No. Janice and I were friends before we got married. She knew
everything about me, all the women I had kids with, everything. We
prayed together. I could tell her anything. When I got married, I
said, ``Hey, I feel I did this for the wrong reasons. I'm sorry.
What can we do about this?'' I got married because I thought it was
what God wanted me to do. But sometimes we do things because it's
what God wanted and later we realized it was wrong. Everything
turned upside-down. Everything that I felt I had overcome, I
slipped back and went down the same road. . . . If Janice had said,
``Well, let's go (divorce),'' it would've made things a lot easier.
I thought it would be better to do it right away than wait five
years and then say you made a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where is your marital situation now?
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not going to talk about that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You could have supported your children financially but not
publicly acknowledged them. Why are you admitting this?
</P>
<P>
   A: Kids shouldn't suffer from the ignorance or mistakes of their
parents. They're my kids and I don't put nothing before my kids
except God.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How have they reacted to all of this?
</P>
<P>
   A: I talk to them. I don't want them to make the same mistakes
that I made. I want them to realize sometimes parents make wrong
decisions. I teach them that their life doesn't have to be this
way.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You realize, of course, that your image is going to be
damaged by this.
</P>
<P>
   A: I'm not overly concerned. I've overcome this. People need to
realize when they look at my life that I've had a lot of situations
that I've overcome. This is just one more thing I will overcome. My
kids won't end up this way and that's what's important _ when your
kids don't make the same mistakes you make.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You consider yourself a devout Christian. Isn't your
infidelity in conflict with your religious beliefs?
</P>
<P>
   A: What I believe in is what will allow me to overcome it. A lot
of people don't get on board (religiously) because they think other
people will say, ``Y'all will think I'm a hypocrite if I make a
mistake.'' But the family you come from, your community, your
father, his father, what values you were taught as a kid _ these
are where bad habits come. I've made mistakes before but I didn't
have a big name. Now I have a big name, so everybody knows my
mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: But you also have put your Christianity in the forefront.
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes, but that's what allows people to know, ``If he overcomes
this, I can overcome it too. He's a Christian man.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has sexual responsibility always been a problem for you?
</P>
<P>
   A: It started when I was 20 years old (while dating his first
wife, Paulette). I've never thought what I did was right. Wrong is
wrong. Putting on a condom is just as wrong as not having one. I'm
a Christian. Being with another woman with a condom on is wrong.
Until someone learns to abstain, that's the only way they can never
make a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You married Paulette in 1985 because Evander Jr. had been
born?
</P>
<P>
   A: I wanted to do the right thing as a father. Of course, I
wasn't really happy then and I made the same mistake. But I was so
young and irresponsible. Once I got out of that marriage (and had
other relationships), it was, ``Trust me. I'm on birth control.''
But whether it's (the woman's) irresponsibility or my
irresponsibility, I have to take care of the baby. And I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Do you believe other women have tried to trap you into
marriage?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't say that. I would say that everybody I had a baby
with desired to marry me.
</P>
<P>
   Q: President Clinton's sexual indiscretions dominate the news.
What would you tell people who say you are no better than he is?
</P>
<P>
   A: The difference is people have the opportunity to know me for
who I am. I never said I haven't made a mistake in this area. I've
let them know I have. I've even told companies, ``I don't mind you
signing me up (for endorsements), but these are things I have
done.'' I didn't want them to find something out later and say,
``Oh, he deceived us. We thought he was a perfect person.'' I'm not
the type of person stealing someone's trust by telling them
something that I'm not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is fidelity still a struggle?
</P>
<P>
   A: No, I feel like I've overcome it all now.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How have you been able to mentally shut out your personal
life while boxing, particularly before the (first) Tyson fight,
which was the biggest of your career?
</P>
<P>
   A: You can't let one aspect of your life weigh on another aspect
of your life. But the reason I've been more successful in one area
than another is I'm not applying the same discipline. I pray over
my boxing. I work hard. I haven't been in that mode in my personal
life. I make excuses, like, ``I ain't got no father (who raised
him).''
</P>
<P>
   Q: What changes have you made?
</P>
<P>
   A: I realize now I have to spend more time with my kids, like
going to see my sons play football the other day (before last
Saturday night's bout). I didn't want to be there, but I realized I
needed to be. I have to break the habit of just doing what I want
to do in my spare time. I didn't become great overnight in boxing,
but I kept my focus. Now I think my family is getting better
because I'm focused on them like I always focused on fighting. I've
got to save my family.

 &HT;    Mere mortals pale in the shadow of Ripken's accomplishment
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CINCINNATI _ On the clubhouse television, Baltimore's Cal
Ripken, Jr., sat in front of a camera, his sea-blue eyes flashing
under his receding gray hairline.
</P>
<P>
   Take the Orioles uniform off and somebody might ask, ``Who's
that, Mark McGwire's high school principal?''
</P>
<P>
   No, it's The Graphite Man. Iron Man? Ripken far surpassed the
iron age with his unfathomable run of 2,632 straight appearances on
a baseball field. Not even a robot could play in 2,632 straight
baseball games without blowing a circuit and getting an arm knocked
off on a slide.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati shortstop Barry Larkin watched the television as he
dressed for Monday night's game, a game in which he wouldn't play
due to a sore ankle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what is more significant, what Mc-Gwire and Sammy Sosa are
doing to the home-run record, or what Ripken did over the course of
the past 16 baseball seasons, Larkin pointed to the television set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely what that man did,'' Larkin said. ``Not to slight
what the other boys are doing, but you can't even do what Ripken
did on Nintendo. You can hit 65 home runs on Nintendo.''
</P>
<P>
   Catcher Eddie Taubensee, who has started only one of the last
six games because he is exhausted after catching in a career-high
127 games, smiled as he watched Ripken and said, ``He and I have
one thing in common. Neither one of us has ever been on the
disabled list. I've never been on the DL, not even in the minors.''
</P>
<P>
   That's an amazing accomplishment for a catcher, but Taubensee
realizes it doesn't come close to Ripken's streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat out Sunday's game because Cal sat out,'' Taubensee said
with a laugh. ``Hey, 2,632 straight games? He deserves a day off. I
can't imagine that. On our team we see Barry Larkin and Bret Boone
try to play every day . . . but every day for 16 years? Wow.''
</P>
<P>
   Boone leads the Reds by playing in 151 games this season and had
played in all until August. He realizes the difficulty of playing
every game in one year, not to even consider 16 years of never
missing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't even imagine that,'' he said. ``At one time, about
three or four years ago, I thought I could play every day of my
life. No way and good luck. There are times you just hit the wall
and you have to take a day off . . . and that doesn't even take
into consideration getting hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   Manager Jack McKeon says it will never happen again. That's what
they said, too, when Lou Gehrig played 2,130 games. But times have
changed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Long-term contracts, bad advice from other people . . .
players these days who are just hanging on want out of the
lineup,'' McKeon said. ``They won't play hurt. A lot of days Ripken
had to be hurt, a sore ankle or something. It's a tribute to him
that he set an example for young players on how to play the game.
Hurt? Tired? You persevere and play the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes a lot of self-determination, discipline and desire to
do that,'' McKeon added. ``Somebody do it again? Never. Not even
close. You have to be tough, real tough and be a gamer who wants to
come to the park and be ready to play every day. I don't see that
these days . . . and he'll probably be in the Hall of Fame because
he did it.''
</P>
<P>
   The leader now is Albert Belle of the Chicago White Sox, 327
games, and he burst out laughing (and Belle never laughs) when
asked about somebody playing 2,633 straight games.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's one record Ripken doesn't have to worry about anyone
breaking,'' Belle said. ``That's one record I 've never thought
about. That's incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   At the very least.
