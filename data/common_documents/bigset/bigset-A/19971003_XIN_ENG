<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The London International
Financial Futures and Options Exchange (LIFFE) traded a record of
20.1 million contracts in September, a rise of 43 percent over the
same 1996 period.
</P>
<P>
This means that the exchange, for the first time, has traded
more contracts than any other exchange in the world, according to
LIFFE officials.
</P>
<P>
Statistics released today show that average daily volume
amounted to 913,872 contracts, representing a daily nominal
turnover of 217.96 billion pounds (350 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Jack Wigglesworth, Chairman of LIFFE, said "It is only by
adapting to change and in meeting market needs that financial
market can be successful. It is LIFFE's ability to provide a
deeply liquid, efficient and safe market in the recent uncertainty
over European interest rates."
</P>
<P>
The achievement also reflected the growing importance of Europe
in international capital markets, he added.

JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The 1997 African Gymnastic

Staff College.
</P>
<P>
''We all recognize that this system enhances peaceful
collaboration, mutual cooperation and understanding which are
essential and categorical prerequisites for peace, tranquillity
and unimpeded development in the entire sub-region,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-four students including two officers from Ghana and
Malawi graduated from the junior staff course.
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Factory Orders Up 1.3 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Factory orders increased
by a strong 1.3 percent in August resulting mainly from a surge in
demand for electronic components, U.S. Commerce Department said
today.
</P>
<P>
The department reported that U.S. factory orders jumped to a
seasonally adjusted 335.4 billion dollars in the month after gains
of 0.5 percent in July and 1.7 percent in June.
</P>
<P>
The August rise in factory orders was more than accounted for
by a 76.9 percent surge in orders for electronic components such
as semiconductors and circuit boards.
</P>
<P>
Factory orders on durable goods -- items expected to last for
more than three years -- increased by 2.7 percent but orders for
nondurable goods declined by 0.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
Shipments of factory goods, a measure of current production,
fell by 0.8 percent to a seasonally adjusted 330.4 billion dollars
in August. It was the first drop since May and was attributed to
the United Parcel Service strike.
</P>
<P>
As a result of the shipments decline, unfilled orders rose 1
percent to a seasonally adjusted 527.2 billion dollars. Factory
inventories rose by 0.4 percent to a seasonally adjusted 448.5
billion.
</P>
<P>
The report fits with U.S. analysts' belief that the economic
growth is stabilizing after increasing at a 4.1 percent annual
rate in the first half of this year.

<HEADLINE> Britain to Demand Relaxation of EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The British government has
unveiled a new initiative on exporting cattles with convincing
records in an effort to ease the European Union's (EU) world-wide
ban on exports of British beef products.
</P>
<P>
Britain's Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham told reporters
early today that the London government would ask Britain's EU
partners later today to examine detailed plans that would ask for
the export of beef from animals born after August 1 last year.
</P>
<P>
"We have to convince our European partners, there's no other
way. We can't act independently in these matters," Cunningham
said.
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal known as a "date-based scheme", meat from
cattles born after the specified date and from which some risky
parts has been removed could be exported to other European
countries again.
</P>
<P>
Early last month the EU's scientific veterinary committee
indicated that exports of British beef could resume if there was a
computerized system to trace animals and make sure none had come
into contact with mad cow disease.
</P>
<P>
The scheme may only effectively help Northern Ireland at the
moment in resuming beef exports, since it is the only British
region where such a computerized tracking system is in operation.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed a global ban on British beef exports in March
1996 after the British government admitted possible links between
mad cow disease and its human equivalent Creutzdfeldt Jacob
Disease.

<HEADLINE> 192 Crime Syndicates In S. Africa, Minister Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A total of 192 organized
crime syndicates were known to be operating in South Africa,
Safety and Security Minister Sydney Mufamadi said today.
</P>
<P>
He told the National Assembly that 1,903 "primary suspects"
connected with the syndicates had been pinpointed by May this
year, South African Press Association reported.
</P>
<P>
He said that 92 hostage-taking incidents occurred in the
country between July 1, 1996 and August 29, 1997 with 198
hostages involved.
</P>
<P>
Seven people were killed and 13 injured in the incidents.
</P>
<P>
About one third of these incidents, or 29, related to domestic
or financial problems and unfaithfulness, seven to robbery, three
to threatened family murders, four to vehicle hijack attempts and
four to jails.
</P>
<P>
It seems that crime has become an epidemic in South Africa.
Severe crimes such as murder, rape and robbery were believed to
have withheld the inflow of foreign investors and tourists, two
things much needed by South Africa to rejuvenate its economy.
</P>
<P>
Mufamadi also disclosed that 103 policemen had committed
suicide this year by September 10. In the whole year of 1996, the
figure was 160.
</P>
<P>
In the 12-month period to August 31 this year, there were 173
deaths in police custody, the minister said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. College Students Spend $5.5 Billion on Alcohol </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. college students spend
5.5 billion U.S. dollars on alcohol each year, more than on books,
soda, coffee, juice and milk combined, said the Christian Science
Monitor today.
</P>
<P>
According to a 1995 nationwide survey of college students by
the Harvard University, 44 percent admitted to drinking in binges
(meaning that men drink five or more drinks at a setting, and
women drink four or more). Members of fraternities and sororities
are among the most likely to binge, at 86 percent and 80 percent,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Campus alcohol-abuse has brought a number of problems and the
issue is becoming urgent. Binge drinking has become a sad fact of
life on most college campuses. This year alone, three students
have died from injuries sustained while drunk. The latest case was
the death of a Massachusetts Institute of Technology student from
overdrinking this week.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many colleges sell alcohol at sports
events and some even sell bear ad T-shirts. Experts called for new
rules to curb the abuse.
</P>
<P>
Some campuses are experimenting aggressive new ways. The State
University of New York in Albany has worked out an agreement with
off-campus tavern owners to stop happy hours and avoid selling to
minors; Ohio State University in Columbus suspended a dozen
students after a drunken post-football-game riot in 1996; and the
University of Rhode Island at Kingston has banned alcohol at all
campus activities.

<HEADLINE> Depreciating Zimbabwe Dollar to Push up Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce (ZNCC) said today the dramatic fall in the Zimbabwe
Dollar this week is likely to result in higher prices for
imported goods currently being stocked for the Christmas holiday.
</P>
<P>
Edmore Tobaiwa, vice-chairman of the ZNCC national standing
committee on economics, trade and taxation, said the slide in the
local currency which began about four weeks ago is putting
pressure on commercial enterprises stocking up for the festive
season.
</P>
<P>
"To that end it will result in high prices for the highly
traded imported goods during that season," Tobaiwa noted.
</P>
<P>
The local currency unit, which exporters say was overvalued by
five percent, plunged to the 13:1 levels against the U.S. Dollar
on Monday before the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe intervened to bring
it back to 12.7 Zimbabwe Dollars to the U.S. Dollar on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks the unit had been trading at just under
12 Zimbabwe Dollars to the Dollar.
</P>
<P>
Speculation had been rife that the local currency unit would
fall before the end of year, resulting in exporters keeping their
revenue in hard currency, and shortage of foreign currency on the
local market which increased pressure on the local Dollar.

<HEADLINE> ILO Trains Businessmen for Small Scale </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- More than 600 aspiring business
people from three sub-Saharan countries were trained on how to
start and run businesses under a program of the International
Labor Organization (ILO), an ILO official said today.
</P>
<P>
At the one-day Micro and Small Scale Enterprise Promotion
Network (MISSEP) in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's second largest city, ILO
official Chakanetsa Rukobo said, about 400 of the 600 people
trained in Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe under the Start Your
Business Program (SYB) were from Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"Between 18 and 20 percent of the people actually started
businesses after being trained under the program," Rukobo said.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out that small-to-medium scale enterprises
still face a number of problems such as access to finance,
collateral, high interest rates and the disbursement rate of the
loans.
</P>
<P>
SYB is a business start-up training program which enables
entrepreneurs to evaluate the viability of their business ideas,
and provides them with the skills to start their own business.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Privatize Loss-Making Parastatals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean President Robert
Mugabe today reaffirmed the government's determination to
privatize loss-making parastatal enterprises which he blamed for
the country's huge budget deficit.
</P>
<P>
Officially commissioning Forestry Commission's Chimanimani
Sawmill in east Zimbabwe, Mugabe said the government would not
backtrack on privatizing loss-making parastatals.
</P>
<P>
The government policy was that all public enterprises
producing marketable services should cease to be a burden on the
fiscal, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Instead, they must be made to be self-financing and
self-sustaining and, in due course, must in fact be a source of
revenue for the government through taxing and payment of
dividends," the president told thousands of people who witnessed
the commissioning.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe said privatization would enable the government to focus
on its core business of running the politics of the country.
</P>
<P>
"Plans are at an advanced stage to commercialize and later on
privatize the remainder of the targeted loss-making parastatals,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
Chimanimani Sawmill is the country's largest sawmill with a
processing capacity of 125,000 cubic meters of round logs and
55,000 cubic meters of sawn timber a year.

<HEADLINE> Prince Charles and Son to Visit S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 2 (Xinhua) -- British heir to the throne
Prince Charles and his son, Prince Harry, will visit South Africa
on November 1-5, British Consulate General in Cape Town announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The consulate general dismissed media reports that the planned
trip were to be postponed or canceled, South African Press
Association reported.
</P>
<P>
"These reports have no basis in truth," a statement of the
consulate said.
</P>
<P>
The statement said details of the trip are yet to be
discussed. As for now, only one thing is for sure: Prince Charles
has indicated his intention to attend a concert at Johannesburg
Stadium on the evening of November 1.
</P>
<P>
Media reports have speculated that the visit might be
postponed or even canceled owing to security fears.
</P>
<P>
It was believed that the visit had been designed to fulfill a
promise of Princess Diana, who died in a car crash in Paris on
August 31.
</P>
<P>
Prince Charles, former husband of Diana, and Earl Spencer,
Diana's brother who lives in Cape Town, were supposed to
accompany Prince Harry to the Shamwari game reserve in Eastern
Cape near port Elizabeth.
</P>
<P>
The reserve was a place of special significance for Diana
because it is also the setting of a Hollywood, Mambo, which
Diana's boyfriend, Dodi al Fayed, had intended to invest in.
</P>
<P>
The South African side is reportedly making security
preparations for the royal visit. A no-fly zone is expected to be
designed to keep away unwanted photographers, reports said.

<HEADLINE> UK Bankers Urge for Clear Government Stand on EMU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The British Bankers Association
(BBA), which represents British and overseas banks based in
Britain, is to press the government to put a clear time frame on
Britain's membership of the European Monetary Union (EMU).
</P>
<P>
Tim Sweeney, Director-General of the BBA, was quoted by today's
Financial Times as saying: "We have got to be realistic, we are
not necessarily expecting a concrete date, but we would like to
see a narrowing down of options."
</P>
<P>
The BBA is among several business organizations taking part in
an advisory group, set up by Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer
Gordon Brown, to investigate the practical implications of the
single European currency due to be implemented on January 1 1999.
</P>
<P>
British bankers and business leaders regularly complain that
uncertainty created by London's opt-out of the single currency
named euro has impeded efforts to prepare for the EMU.
</P>
<P>
Business consultants also reported that British companies are
among the worst prepared within the the 15-member European Union.
</P>
<P>
British banks' wholesale operations will be ready for 1999, but
most have no plans to equip their retail branches with dual
currency handling facilities until the Government has given a
firmer indication about its intentions, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Bank consultants are warning companies not to risk delaying
their EMU preparations, since inability to handle transactions
from January 1 1999 could result in a permanent loss of customers.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President Sets for Talks in New York </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- President Glafcos Clerides
departed today for New York for talks on the Cyprus problem and
especially his proposal for demilitarizing the island.
</P>
<P>
Speaking before his departure, President Clerides said the
objective of his meetings during his tour will be "to promote a
solution to the Cyprus problem."
</P>
<P>
He stressed that he will focus especially on the
demilitarization of the island, Turkish threats against Cyprus and
other relevant issues.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides will address the U.N. General Assembly and
is expected to have meetings with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan and U.S. Presidential envoy on Cyprus Richard Holbrooke.
</P>
<P>
After his stay in New York, he will fly on to Washington, and
then France, Britain and Greece.
</P>
<P>
Clerides' proposal for demilitarization, put forward in 1993,
promises disbanding the Cypriot National Guard and handing over
its weapons and equipment to the U.N. Peace-keeping Force in
Cyprus (UNFICYP).
</P>
<P>
In return, the proposal calls for withdrawal of the Turkish
troops from the island and disbanding of the Turkish Cypriot armed
forces. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side have rejected the
proposal.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has remained divided since 1974 when Turkish troops
invaded and took over the northern third of the island in the wake
of a failed pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Turkey maintains 35,000-strong troops in the Turkish
Cypriot-controlled northern part of the island.

<P>
However, clan clashing has continued elsewhere in the country.
This week Ali Mehadi accused his rival forces of Hussien Aideed
of killing 260 people and burning 20 villages in three days in

<HEADLINE> Sergeyev on Russian-NATO Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 2 (Xinhua) -- There are no reasons today for
splitting up Europe's strategic space into counterpoised poles,
Russian Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev said here today after
returning from Maastricht, where an informal meeting of the NATO
defense ministers was held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Itar-Tass quoted Sergeyev as saying that constructive
cooperation between Russia and the North Atlantic Alliance must be
the foundation for stability and security in future Europe.
</P>
<P>
On the problem of NATO's eastward enlargement, Sergeyev said
through the Founding Act was signed in Paris, Russia still regards
the NATO enlargement plans as a factor that does not contribute to
the stabilization of the military-political situation in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Russia, the minister said, comes out for the transformation of
the North Atlantic Alliance from a military-political bloc into a
political organization.
</P>
<P>
The Founding Act "stipulates for the first time nineteen areas
of cooperation between Russia and NATO, beginning from joint
actions in case of critical situations and ending with measures to
combat terrorism and drug trafficking", Sergeyev said, so it
offers additional military-political chances to promote stability
and is an effective instrument for jointly countering military
threats.
</P>
<P>
Russia and the 16 NATO countries are nowable to hold
consultations on an equal footing within the Joint Permanent
Council on a broad range of problems, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
Sergeyev also stressed that he preferred to see the Council as
a body that will "ensure a higher level of trust in the process of
cooperation between Russia and NATO in order to enhance each other's
security and the security of all the countries in the
Euro-Atlantic Region."

The appeal was made by Bizima Karaha, foreign minister of the

units which have shelled in Kinshasa, killing up to 31 people
this week.

BEIRUT, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Pilots and stewardess of Lebanese
Middle East Airline (MEA) today staged a two-hour strike to
protest the company's delay in payment owed to the present and

</P>
<P>
The strike delayed the take-off of four flights to Berlin,

Lebanese Central News Agency quoted the President of MEA Staff
Union Kabtin Ibrahim as saying that they were driven by several

</P>

With 170 pilots, MEA lost more than 10 million U.S. dollars

<HEADLINE> EC Proposes to Ensure Primary Agricultural Product Safety </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission, the
European Union (EU)'s executive body, has put forward a proposal
for people throughout the Single Market to seek compensation for
damages caused by defective primary agricultural products.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was put forward by the Commission on the
initiative of Single Market Commissioner Mario Monti, which takes
the form of a proposal to include primary agricultural products in
the scope of the EU's existing product liability directive, it was
learned here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The directive on product liability requires the producer or
importer to pay compensation if there is a link found between the
damage and the defect, without a person having to prove negligence
on the part of the producer or importer.
</P>
<P>
The European Parliament's report on bovine spongiform
encephalopathy (BSE) has specifically requested the Commission to
present such a proposal.
</P>
<P>
"This proposal responds to people's legitimate consumer
concerns about the safety of primary agricultural products within
the Single Market," said Mr. Monti.
</P>
<P>
Following recent anxiety over BSE, the commissioner said, the
proposal will provide an additional incentive for producers and
importers of primary agricultural products in the EU to ensure
that product safety receives top priority.

<HEADLINE> New UK Proposal to Lift European Ban on Beef Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRIGHTON, England, October 2 (Xinhua) - A proposal aimed at
restarting British beef exports has been put forward by
Agriculture Minister Jack Cunningham today.
</P>
<P>
The proposal would lift the export ban for all cattle born
after 1 August 1996 and clear the way for British beef farmers to
re-enter world markets.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the Labor Conference, Cunningham said: "This is a
positive step in our new approach to lifting the beef export ban."
</P>
<P>
The plan has now been formally submitted to the European
Commission, according to the Minister.
</P>
<P>
At the European Head of Government meeting in Florence on 21
June 1996 agreement was reached on a framework for the progressive
removal of the ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The "Florence Framework" required Britain to meet a number of
pre-conditions reflecting its agreed plan for the eradication of
BSE.
</P>
<P>
Cunningham said: "The main way in which cattle have been
infected with BSE is through feed. Since August 1996 the UK has
enforced very strict controls to make sure that feed does not
contain meat and bone meal."
</P>
<P>
The Minister today also proposed the compulsory slaughter of
all offspring from BSE infected cows born on or after 1 August
1996.
</P>
<P>
The Date Based Export Scheme proposed by the British
government, together with the cull of animals potentially at risk
of BSE through maternal transmission, sets strict rules under
which beef exports could resume.
</P>
<P>
However, Cunningham said that "Lifting the export ban is a
priority. The way to do this is not by shouting and being
unrealistic. It must be by co-operation and constructive
dialogue."

<HEADLINE> Removal of Obstacles Crucial to Peace: Ambassador </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A resumption of peace talks
between the Palestinians and Israel depends on the removal of the
obstacles in the way, said the Palestinian Ambassador Zohdi Al
Qodra to Egypt.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
(MENA) today, Al Qodra said the obstacles are preventing the talks
and its possible achievements.
</P>
<P>
He blamed the deadlock in the peace talks on Israel's failure
to withdraw its troops from most areas of the West Bank and its
construction of Jewish settlements in East Arab Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
It was the joint efforts of the Palestinians and Egypt that had
restored life to the peace process and revived hope in rescuing
it, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian ambassador said the crucial point rested in the
results to be achieved and the tangible progress to be made in the
peace process, despite the significance of the resumption of peace
talks between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
He said the Palestinians have asked, and are waiting for an
answer from, Israel to relinquish its hardline stances including
settlement policies so that progress could be achieved in the
peace process, which is cherished by all people in the region.

<P>
BRIGHTON, England, October 2 (Xinhua) - British Sports Minister
Tony Banks's future has hanged in the balance as he made a silly
joke about Opposition Leader William Hague on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Minister told a fringe meeting at the Party Conference that
the Tories had elected a "foetus as party leader" and now "wished
they had voted for abortion".
</P>
<P>
Participants at the conference said that the joke is not only
offensive, it went too far.
</P>
<P>
Tories reacted swiftly at the insult. Its Chairman Lord
Parkinson said: "That was way over the top. It is not a subject
that in the main people would expect people to be making jokes
about."
</P>
<P>
Tory MP Sir Teddy Taylor called the remark "filthy and
offensive". "This is one of the nastiest and unjustifiable
comments I have heard in 33 years in politics," he added.
</P>
<P>
Anti-abortion groups demanded Banks to be sacked. The Pro-Life
Alliance said: "These remarks were tasteless in the extreme."
</P>
<P>
John Smeaton, director of the Society for the Protection of
Child said: "Banks comments are in extremely poor taste and will
offend the overwhelming majority of people."
</P>
<P>
It was reported Prime Minister Tony Blair forced Banks to make
an apology.
</P>
<P>
In a press statement released here today, Banks said: "This was
a tasteless remark, uttered off the cuff, which I acknowledged
caused offence and for which I fully apologize."

</P>
<P>
The programs, which for the first time ever do not only concern
quality beef but also quality veal, comprise a number of
promotional activities which include publicity measures in radio
and TV, publicity measures in magazines and papers and promotional
activities at the points of sales.
</P>
<P>
The Commission says that the promotional strategy is mainly
aimed to reassure consumers and increase consumer confidence in
the value of quality beef, guarantee the existence of full and
independent control from the producer to the consumer and to
increase the market share of quality beef.

<HEADLINE> Qatar to Host Planned Mideast, North Africa Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) - Qatar has decided to go
ahead with the plan to host the Fourth Economic Summit for the
Middle East and North Africa next November despite some
controversies among Arab nations, the country's foreign minister
said today.
</P>
<P>
The minister, Sheikh Hamad Jassim bin Jabr al-Thani, made the
announcement in a speech at the general debate of the United
Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Some Arab nations thought that conference, planned to be held
in Doha, should be canceled because of the current Israeli policy
"that did not respect the undertaking and agreements, flouting the
international legality and trying to marginalize the role of the
United Nations."
</P>
<P>
While understanding that view, Qatar respected its
international commitments and believed that no states should have
the power to veto the peace process, Hamad noted.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we decided to host the conference during the
announced period. If the conference does not prove to be
successful and does not achieve the desired results, only the
government of Israel will be responsible for that," he added.
</P>
<P>
Qatar had committed itself at the Economic Summit of Amman in
1995 to hosting the fourth summit.

<HEADLINE> Most of Zambian Employees in Informal Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government is
worried with the fact that most of employees are working in
informal sector.
</P>
<P>
Labor and Social Security Minister Peter Machungwa told
parliament here today that in 1996, there were 2,398,000 people
employed in the informal sector and only 468,000 were in the
formal sector.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the downward trend of the formal sector
is merely a short run phenomenon associated with the
liberalization policies the government has embarked upon.
</P>
<P>
The trend is expected to be reversed in the long term when the
country's economy stabilizes as employment creation accelerates,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Machungwa also told the house that so far 80 Zambian
professionals who went for greener pastures abroad have been
attracted back into the country following positive measures
including improved salaries.
</P>
<P>
He singled out the equal work, equal pay principle being
encouraged by the government as the main incentive that is
attracting professionals from abroad.
</P>
<P>
Due to lack of funds, the government does not have the data
bank on Zambian professionals to ascertain how many such
professionals have left to work in other countries.
</P>
<P>
The system will be put in place by the next year as funds
become available, the minister said.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Belarus is in favor of
Eastern Europe having one seat on the U.N. Security Council as
part of the reform of the international organization.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the General Assembly here today, Ivan Antonovich,
Belarus Foreign Minister, said that the Republic of Belarus is
convinced that allocation of one more non-permanent seat on the
Security Council to the Eastern European regional group is in full
compliance with the U.N. Charter.
</P>
<P>
The members from the region in the United Nations have more
than doubled over recent years. They should have a representative
in the Security Council, in line with the principle of equitable
geographical representation, according to the foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
He quoted the president of Belarus as saying that the United
Nations' reforms should be directed at strengthening the
organization's potentials in peacekeeping, humanitarian and
information services.
</P>
<P>
The functional efficiency of the U.N. system also includes
effective distribution of resources, streamlining administrative and
organizational structures, structural and budgetary changes at the
Secretariat, he said.
</P>
<P>
Reiterating Belarus' opposition to the expansion of the North
Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), he said his country favored
NATO's transformation into a universal European organization for
peace and security. Belarus had entered into negotiations with
NATO for its participation in the "Partnership for Peace".

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Aims at Developing Lake Victoria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania has expressed
stronger wishes to develop infrastructure facilities at the Lake
Victoria, the second largest freshwater lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Tanzanian government is working closely with other eastern
African states in this sector, Batholomeo Rufunjo, Marine
Transport Director with the Ministry of Communications and
Transport, said here today.
</P>
<P>
Several investors have required detailed information on market
potentials and technical information such as on navigation charts
and communication systems, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Representatives from Tanzania, Kenya and Uganda met last March
to deliberate on this issue. "We are still working on it,"
Rufunjo said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that Italy, Russia and China have responded to
the Tanzanian government's appeal to develop infrastructure in
the lake, as large as 68,000 square kilometers. The ministry is
making greater efforts to convince them to invest.
</P>
<P>
The director said that sound infrastructure would attract
interested businessmen to open up investments in the lake where
transport services were erratic due to inadequate vessels.
</P>
<P>
He hinted that the government was also interested in
establishing a Search and Rescue unit on Lake Victoria, where
over 700 passengers died after the ship of Mv Bukoba sank last
year.

ABU DHABI, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Trade volume between Oman and
Japan rose to 1.23 billion U.S. dollars during the first half of
this year from 1.21 billion dollars a year earlier, the Omani News
Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Japan's exports to Oman reached 344.1 million dollars in the
period, an increase of 8.9 percent, while its imports amounted to
893 million dollars, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Japan mainly exported machinery, electronic equipment and
trucks to Oman, and imported crude oil.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, Japan imported 38.6 million
barrels of crude oil from Oman, 6.2 million barrels less than in
the same period of this year.
</P>
<P>
However, due to a 16.1 percent increase in crude price which
reached 18.81 dollars a barrel, Japan registered a nominal
increase of 0.1 percent in oil import from Oman, amounting to
843.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Oman is the eighth largest oil supplier to Japan, providing
about 4.7 percent of Japan's overall oil imports.

<HEADLINE> Violent Crime by Teens Dropped in 1996 in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno announced Thursday arrests for juvenile violent crime plunged
9.2 percent in 1996, the second drop after a juvenile crime wave
of seven years.
</P>
<P>
A 2.9 percent drop in juvenile violence arrests in 1995 was the
first such reduction in seven years, and Reno said, "This drop I
think is for real now."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, for every 100,000 youths aged 10 to 17, there were
464.7 arrests for violent crimes, down from 511.9 in 1995 and
527.4 in the peak year of 1994, according FBI figures.
</P>
<P>
FBI Uniform Crime Report figures for all categories are
scheduled to be released this weekend.
</P>
<P>
Reno attributed the drop to a number of factors, including
provisions in the 1994 Crime Act.
</P>
<P>
She also credits "young people working to keep their friends
and their peers from turning to violence."
</P>
<P>
In responding to questions about several murders by juveniles
around the country in the last few days, Reno said juvenile
violence is "still too high" after record increases from 1986 to
1994.
</P>
<P>
She also promoted Clinton's proposed juvenile crime bill now in
Congress, which contains after-school activities to keep teenagers
away from crime.

WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. administration is

The goal is to offer shows "that might make the content of

<P>
Four Bosnian Serb transmitters were forced by the North

down broadcasts from the station's base in Pale.
</P>
<P>
Foley said he believes international mediators in Bosnia are
attempting to come up with a system to permit broadcasts
throughout Bosnia that would not be ethnically based.

The system would be "free of the monopolizing influence of
political parties" and provide access to a wide variety of views,

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Urges Closer Economic Ties with S. Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's High Commissioner to
South Africa Alhaji Shehu Malami has stressed the need for the
expansion of economic cooperation between the two countries as an
impetus of the warming up bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the envoy, Nigeria, with a population of about
100 million and rich natural resources, provides an attractive
market in the African continent, the News Agency of Nigeria
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, South Africa, which is relatively stronger in the
mining and services sectors, should fully exploit the
opportunities to promote cooperation, he said.
</P>
<P>
At a reception marking Nigeria's 37th independence anniversary
in Pretoria on Monday, Malami restated the commitments of both
countries to provide the framework and enabling environment for
mutual collaboration toward the economic enhancement of the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Efforts were also on to promote the rich cultures of both
countries, the envoy said, adding that Nigeria intended to bring
about an active and sustained exchanges of sporting teams and
cultural troupes between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The relations between the two countries, which came to its
bottom in 1995 when South Africa spearheaded a suspension of
Nigeria's membership in the Commonwealth, has begun to warm up
recently.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi visited Pretoria last
month with a message of Nigerian head of state General Sani
Abacha for President Nelson Mandela.
</P>
<P>
In return, South Africa's Vice-President Thambo Mbeki is
expected to make a trip to Nigeria at an undisclosed date. Mbeki
was originally scheduled to visit Nigeria on September 17-18, but
the timetable was changed for reasons of convenience.

<P>
LONDON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Leading stock markets in Europe
ended mixed today, with London and Paris suspending their recent
rally and reversing into the negative ground on profit-taking and
a weak Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
British shares on the London market had surged by 0.9 percent
earlier in the morning to a fresh intraday high of 5,367.3 points
before ending lower as profit-taking forced the FTSE 100 index to
retreat.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the main impetus for the market's early rally
came from a Financial Times newspaper report that the UK
government plans for a corporate tax overhaul, which would cut the
tax charges of some of the UK's leading companies.
</P>
<P>
The index closed at 5,296.1, down 21.0 points.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the CAC-40 index shed early gains to end 2.86 points
down at 3,052.07, tracking a softer dollar and an early decline in
the Dow.
</P>
<P>
Dealers said that the market was cautious ahead of US September
jobs figures due on Friday and a national jobs conference on
October 10.
</P>
<P>
However, German shares sustained Wednesday's gains and ended
stronger after an early mark-up but off best levels in subdued
trading ahead of a market holiday and US economic data.

<HEADLINE> US Official Acknowledges Criticisms of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- A key U.S. official has
acknowledged international criticisms of U.S. sanctions policies
and said Washington needs to make them "part of a coherent
strategy" including seeking multilateral support.
</P>
<P>
"We... find value in many of them (international criticisms)
and will factor them into our future work," Undersecretary of
State Stuart Eizenstat said in a speech last Friday to the Global
Business Forum, which was made available today.
</P>
<P>
The United States should meet the challenge, he said, "to find
a way to improve the way we make sanctions decisions, to ensure
that sanctions are part of a coherent strategy, to accurately
measure the costs and effects of sanctions measures, to seek
multilateral support where possible and to improve coordination
between the administration and Congress."
</P>
<P>
Eizenstat agreed that sanctions hurt the U.S. economy --
costing more than 19 billion dollars in 1995 in lost export sales
and 250,000 jobs.
</P>
<P>
The figures he cited come from a report by the President's
Export Council, which also said sanctions undermine confidence in
the reliability of U.S. suppliers, provide a competitive advantage
for foreign firms and impose costs on third parties and innocent
civilians in countries subject to sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Reuters, which got a copy of Eizenstat's speech from the State
Department at its request, said the undersecretary's views are
important because he is a key U.S. official involved with U.S.
sanctions disputes with Europe and other countries.
</P>
<P>
This includes the row over the French oil giant Total SA and
its partners, Russian Gazprom and Malaysian Petronas who announced
on September 28 a 2 billion dollar contract with Iran to develop
Iran's South Pars natural gas field.
</P>
<P>
The United States threatened Monday to impose the 1996
Iran-Libya Sanctions Act on Total and its Russian and Malaysian
partners but was greeted with scoff from the French government,
which proclaimed Washington has no right to impose its law beyond
its border.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA) is planning to find ways to
communicate with Pathfinder on the Mars that has now outlived its
original minimum design life by nearly two months.
</P>
<P>
NASA scientists said today that it's possible its battery is
dead and solar energy will have to be used in the future.
</P>
<P>
After three days of problems communicating with the spacecraft,
controllers were able to re-establish enough contact with
Pathfinder through an auxiliary transmitter to determine it's
still operational.
</P>
<P>
Another similar signal was received today, but again no data
was transmitted, Project Manager Brian Muirhead said.
</P>
<P>
Muirhead is certain that the lander's battery had finally died,
which would mean that using the spacecraft would require devising
new ways to control Pathfinder during periods when its solar
panels are generating enough power.
</P>
<P>
Pathfinder reached the red planet on July 4. The lander was
designed to operate a minimum of 30 days, while its little mobile
rover, Sojourner, was designed to operate just seven days.
However, both are still operating.
</P>
<P>
They have sent back clear images of the martian landscape,
sunrises and frozen ice clouds, and relayed chemical analyses of
rocks on the Mars.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He Won't Pressure Reno on Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said today he won't pressure Attorney General Janet Reno in any
way as she weighs whether to open a further probe of White House
fund-raising phone calls.
</P>
<P>
Clinton hinted that if Reno does order a 90-day preliminary
investigation of him or Vice President Al Gore, the next step in
the process toward appointment of an independent counsel, it might
be helpful.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Rose Garden with Gore at his side, Clinton
said, "This is a legal question and it should be done based on an
independent legal review, with no pressure from the outside from
me or from anyone else. And that's the way I intend to keep it, at
least on my part."
</P>
<P>
Reno should decide by Friday whether to begin such an
investigation of Gore's fund-raising calls in the 1996 elections.
She has until October 15 to decide in Clinton's case.
</P>
<P>
Reno is considering whether the 1883 federal law, never tested
in court, prevents Clinton or Gore from soliciting funds by
telephone on federal property. Gore has admitted making such calls
from his office but insists he never meant to raise so-called hard
money that goes directly to campaigns. The Democratic National
Committee did channel some of Gore's proceeds into hard money
accounts, which is prohibited.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said he is unsure he made fund-raising calls from his
office, despite memos urging him to do so.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Reno is declining to answer questions on whether she
would order the preliminary investigation.

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Cautiously Welcome Israeli Move </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian permanent
representative to the Arab League Mohamed Sobeih has expressed
hope that the release of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, founder of Hamas,
would lead to the release of all the Palestinian detainees in
Israel.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Egyptian Middle East News Agency
(MENA) today, Sobeih said that Israel must set free all the
Palestinians it detained, which was an indivisible part of the
peace process between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israel on Wednesday released Hamas' spiritual leader Yassin,
who was then flown to Amman aboard a Jordanian airplane.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, an eloquent preacher, founded Hamas in December 1987
following the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising (Intifada) in
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. He was arrested by the Israeli
authorities and sentenced to life imprisonment in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Sobeih called on the United States to intensify its efforts to
rescue the peace process, and urged Israel to immediately cease
its construction of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's continued siege of the Palestinian
self-ruled areas violated the principles of peace and the signed
agreements, and would undermine the atmosphere of confidence
required to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Palestinian ambassador to Egypt Zohdi al Qodra
expressed cautious welcome to the release of Yassin by Israel,
saying that this move might be aimed to cater for world opinion.
</P>
<P>
He said that Yassin should be allowed to return to Gaza as soon
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Arab diplomatic sources here said that Israel's release of
Yassin was mainly aimed at demonstrating a positive sign of
goodwill to the Arab world to encourage them to attend the Middle
East and North Africa Economic Summit, due to be held in November
in Qatari capital Doha.
</P>
<P>
The sources pointed out that by releasing Yassin and handing
him over to Jordan, Israel was to contain the political crisis
which erupted between the two countries following the attempted
murder of Khalid Mashiel, leader of Hamas' political bureau, by
suspected Israeli Mossad agents.

<TEXT>
<P>

joint initiative on reducing working week time to help create jobs
in Europe, said official of the two countries attending the annual
Franco-Italian summit held in Chambery, southeast France.

<P>
This initiative, launched by French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin and his Italian counterpart Romano Prodi, will be presented

held on November 20-21 in Luxembourg, said officials.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac also described the initiative
"excellent" and "well-balanced." He pointed out that he
himself has been fighting for two years to make Europe a world
example in the social field.
</P>
<P>
Paris and Rome held that a reduction of weekly working time is
helpful for creating jobs and increasing the flexibility of job
market.
</P>
<P>
France and Italy did not propose any legally fixed weekly
working time, and instead suggested a better concertation between
employers and employees to make social projects with financial
support from the governments.

The Socialist government of France has just presented a law on
reducing weekly working time to 35 hours in order to help the

to join the European single currency euro on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac suggested that France and Italy cooperate in
aeronautics and air transport industries, and two countries agreed
to construct a trans-Alpes TGV bullet train railway between the
French city Lyon and Italian city Turin for transporting
passengers and commodities, despite opposition from ecologists.

PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today called on Italy to use its influence to help Algeria return
to calmness at the 17th annual Franco-Italian summit held in
Chambery, southeast France.
</P>
<P>

calmness," said Chirac at a press conference held after he joined
the summit.

helping Algeria solve its six-year conflict between the government
and Islamic militant groups.
</P>
<P>
"All that Italy can do in this sense will go in the good
sense. We hope that Italy could, taking into account its
historical context different from that of France in respect of
Algeria, be an element of reason and calmness in the relations
between Algeria and the world," he said.

atrocities" which took place in Algeria.

<HEADLINE> New Book on Lee Kuan Yew Launched in Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A new book on Senior Minister
Lee Kuan Yew of Singapore was launched here today, marking what is
called "the first attempt to organize systematically the Senior
Minister's many ideas".
</P>
<P>
Published by the Singapore Press Holdings (SPH) and the Times
Publishing Group, the 400-page book, entitled "Lee Kuan Yew: The
man and his ideas", tells of the events, people and political
fortunes that were to shape Lee's view of the world, as well as
the path he set for the transformation of Singapore.
</P>
<P>
Based on 13 fresh and exclusive interviews with Lee, the most
extensive he has ever given, the book chronicles Lee's life and
ideas, from his early political awakening in Cambridge to his
present position as an elder statesman.
</P>
<P>
"I believe this book fills an important gap for those who want
to understand him, what his key ideas are and how he came to form
them," Lim Kim San, executive chairman of the SPH said at the
launching ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"More important, it should satisfy those who want to understand
Singapore itself, how it came about and what makes it tick," he
added.
</P>
<P>
At an earlier press conference, Han Fook Kwang, one of the
three authors of the book, said that while other books had been
written about Mr. Lee, the new book was the first attempt to
organize systematically the Senior Minister's many ideas.
</P>
<P>
To do so, the authors read more than 2,000 speeches made over
50 years of Lee's career, he said. The other two authors are
Warren Fernandez and Sumiko Tan. All the three authors are Straits
Times journalists.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Chang'an Avenue, a five-km main
avenue crossing Tiananmen Square in the heart of Beijing, is awash
in the high-powered glow of thousands upon thousands of colorful
bulbs, lanterns and neon lights switched on for the three-day
National Day holiday.
</P>
<P>
"It is literally as bright as the Champs Elysees in Paris,"
said Yuan Zengyi, director of the Street Light Department of the
municipality's electricity supply bureau.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 4,000 streetlights on the Second Ring
Road, which are normally turned off to conserve electricity, are
on for the occasion, and blazing sodium-filament lights have
replaced ordinary ones along main roads to give passersby an even
brighter view.
</P>
<P>
Some 80,000 streetlights, including those on the Third Ring
Road, on expressways heading to cities and areas outside Beijing
and on the side roads, have all been re-wired to illuminate the
capital during the festival.
</P>
<P>
The Tiananmen Square, a major symbol of Beijing, is dripping
with lanterns, neon and floodlights.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, approximately 300 special evening lights along the
Chang'an Avenue are all on, and colorful bulbs outline the large
buildings near the square.
</P>
<P>
And there is more to come, Yuan said. Plans are underway to
make Beijing sparkle even brighter at nighttime, and not only
during holidays.

<HEADLINE> Courier Moves up to Semifinals </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Top seed Jim Courier of the
United States took a straight-set win Friday over Jan Kroslak of
Slovakia to enter the semifinals at the China Open indoor
tournament.
</P>
<P>
The Former world top player Courier, who played more patient
than his young rival, sealed the victory 6-4, 6-3 in 70 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Courier steered seven aces and his first serve percentage was
as high as 85% -- 25% higher than the Slovakian's.
</P>
<P>
Kroslak, this year's Shanghai Open champion, dominated the net
in the first set. His strong and precise straight-line shots kept
Courier on watching at the line. But his 18 unforced errors ruined
his advantage on the net and baseliners and lost the set.
</P>
<P>
The 24-year-old Kroslak came back in the second set to break
first, but soon double faulted awa=0y at 1-1. Courier broke again
at 5-3 through Kroslak's another double fault and took the match
on his service.
</P>
<P>
"I got into his service game more than he was able to get into
mine," said Courier after his win. "But Kroslak played pretty
well. I was not sure whether I could close up the match at the
end."
</P>
<P>
Courier had played just at Doha and Los Angles this year. He
was confident with his performance in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
"I was from feast to famine in the past. I just hope to keep
lining like this."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Friday, Kenneth Carlsen of Denmark edged Alex O'Brien
of the United States 7-5, 5-7, 7-6 (7-4) in the longest match on
the China's ATP Tour.
</P>
<P>
Carlsen stormed 11 aces to one in the two hours and 56 minutes
match. Carlsen, who ranks 90th in the world, rushed more to the
net than the American, who is the world 82nd.
</P>
<P>
In two other quarterfinals, fifth seed Magnus Gustafsson of
Sweden ousted Byron Black of Zimbabwe 6-4, 6-3, while third-seeded
Thomas Johansson of Sweden won 6-2, 6-4 over Italian Gianluca
Pozzi.
</P>

Courier faces Johansson in Saturday's semifinals and Carlsen
will play Gustafsson.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Unemployment Rate Holds Steady in September </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. unemployment rate in
September was unchanged at 4.9 percent, near the lowest level in
24 years, the U.S. Labor Department said today.
</P>
<P>
The unemployment rate last month matched the August rate and
was just a little above the 4.8 percent rate in July and May, the
lowest since 1973.
</P>
<P>
The department said employers added 215,000 jobs to their
payroll in September, up from a paltry 40,000 in August, the
fewest in 11 months.
</P>
<P>
The service sectors in the United States showed the biggest
increase in job creation with new employment of 229,000 in
September. Computer, engineering and management services also
posted healthy gains.
</P>
<P>
The employment in the mining sector, which has been falling for
a long time, rose by 3,000 jobs, most of which were in the oil and
gas industry.
</P>
<P>
However, manufacturers cut 16,000 jobs, with declines
concentrated in auto plants and clothing factories.
</P>
<P>
Among demographic groups, the U.S. unemployment in September
was 4.1 percent for adult men and 4.4 percent for adult women,
both unchanged. The jobless rate for teenagers was up to 16.7
percent from 16.4 percent. The rates were 4.3 percent for the
whites and 9.6 percent for the blacks, up respectively from 4.2
percent and 9.3 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, average hourly earnings of non-supervisory workers
in the country jumped by 4 cents last month to a seasonally
adjusted 12.34 dollars following a 6-cent increase in August. The
average work week declined from 34.6 hours in August to 34.5 hours
in September.

MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said that his country hopes the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
(NATO) turns into a political or peace-keeping organization, the
Itar-Tass news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint interview with Russian and French TV stations,
Yeltsin spoke warmly of the development of bilateral relations
since the signing of the Russia-NATO Founding Act in Paris on May
27.
</P>
<P>
The president also described the first meeting of the
Russian-NATO Permanent Joint Council on September 26 as "very
substantial."
</P>
<P>
"This," Yeltsin said, "provides reasons to hope that the
development will move in a constructive direction."
</P>
<P>
However, Russia would like to see NATO transformed into a
political or at least a peace-keeping organization rather than
remaining as a military alliance, the president added.
</P>
<P>
He also warned that if NATO decided to do anything against the
Founding Act, Russia would certainly respond.
</P>
<P>
As for existing borders in Europe, the Russian president said
there would be no new divisions or re-drawings; World War II had
yielded excellent results.

FUZHOU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A booming export-oriented economy
is bringing big changes to east China's Fujian Province, the home
of many overseas Chinese and Chinese nationals residing abroad.
</P>
<P>
To late last May, 21,000 overseas-funded enterprises have
received approval from relevant authorities in the province, and
they involved a total of 19 billion US dollars. The industrial
volume and exports of these enterprises accounted for more than 50
percent or 60 percent respectively of Fujian's total last year.

The exports volume exceeded 10 billion US dollars in 1996, and
the exports in the first five months of this year increased by 30
percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
As a result, many industrial sectors and rural departments have
set up joint-ventures for manufacturing toys, shoes and caps,
electronic and machinery products.
</P>
<P>
In addition, a lot of local state-run enterprises and private
companies have adopted the international ISO-90000 Standard, and

Mugabe said, ''the government is fully aware of the unfavorable
conditions of service of pilots in the air force of Zimbabwe, and
will strive to correct the situation when the economy improves
and more resources are made available.''
</P>
<P>
Commending the air force for its pragmatic endeavor to achieve
self-sufficiency in manpower training, Mugabe said the Defense
Ministry had embarked on a procurement program to re-equip the
defense forces.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, cadet offices Basil Govindan was voted best
recruit, while women cadets Sheila Musende and Sithandekile Dube
were among the 13 graduates.
</P>
<P>
This brings to three the number of women pilots trained at the
air basekile.
</P>
<P>
''It is important to note that this positive development
fulfills our stated national policy objective of gender
equality,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
The two-year course covered military officership, etiquette
and aviation-related subjects such as aero-dynamics,
aero-engines, instrument meteorology, aerospace and aircraft
electronics.

<HEADLINE> S.Korean Auto Industry Threatened by Super 301 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The decision by the United States
Wednesday to invoke the Super 301 Section against South Korea in
order to press for a wider opening in the auto market has set off
alarm bells in the South Korean automobile industry.
</P>
<P>
The industry, which is facing a domestic crisis involving the
the unsettled Kia troubles, is concerned that the
decision will send shock waves throughout the country if the
results of ensuing auto negotiations with the U.S. go sour.
</P>
<P>
After the termination of the anti-bankruptcy pact for the
financially-strapped Kia Group, a number of auto parts suppliers
and subcontractors to Kia already went belly-up, and other firms
are nearing bankruptcy.
</P>
<P>
The exports of Kia Motors Corporation plunged from 40,000 units in
July to 20,000 units in August and September as the motor company
was placed under the anti-bankruptcy pact.
</P>
<P>
To make things worse, the Seoul-Washington trade dispute over
Seoul's car imports will also lead to a significant drop in car
exports to the U.S., market,watchers said.
</P>
<P>
If the U.S. places the Super 301 Section Act on South Korea, the
domestic auto export to North America, which stood at about 200,000
units last year, is likely to plummet significantly, they said.
</P>
<P>
Hyundai Motor Co., which ships more than 100,000 of its cars to the
U.S. market, expressed the concern that the latest U.S. action would
tarnish the image of South Korean cars among American dealers and
potential customers.
</P>
<P>
Daewoo Motors, which plans to ship three models to the U.S. market
starting from early next year, is also concerned that the Super 301
will become a great hurdle to its marketing strategy.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Korean Automobile Manufacturers Association (KAMA)
said it would map out its own strategy to cope with the situation.
</P>
<P>
KAMA stressed that it would be very painful to accept the U.S.
request to lower South Korea's auto tariff rate to 2.5 percent, from
the current 8 percent. Compromise, however, should be focused on
adjusting South Korea's existing capacity, according to the
association.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Province Builds Railway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Mountainous Guizhou Province,
southwest China, has started to build a railway in its bid to lift
more people out of poverty.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the 120.8-kilometer Shuicheng-Baiguo
Railway, the first local rail link in Guizhou, began on September
28.
</P>
<P>
While all the existing railways in Guizhou have been built with
funds from the central government, the new link will be jointly
financed by the Guizhou provincial government, the Ministry of
Railways and the Ministry of Coal Industry.
</P>
<P>
Known as the largest poverty relief project in the remote areas
in Guizhou, the railway is designed to link up major rail trunks
including the Nanning-Kunming Railway and the Guiyang-Kunming
Railway.
</P>
<P>
Once operational, it is expected to facilitate the development
of local minerals and the poverty relief work in the ethnic
minority areas in southwest China.

<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Belarus protested to Russia today
for aborting the visit of President Alexandr Lukashenko to the
Russian cities of Lipetsk and Yaroslavl, reports said.
</P>
<P>
All Belarussian state-owned media carried Lukashenko's
telegrams to Russian President Boris Yeltsin and to the mayors of
Lipetsk and Yaroslavl, as well as a note from the Belarussian
Foreign Ministry to his Russian counterpart about Lukashenko's
visit, the Itar Tass news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Belarus blamed Russia for denying Lukashenko permission to
visit by linking it with the release of Russian journalist Pavel
Sheremet, who was kept in prison in Belarus' Grodno and charged
with illegally crossing the Belarussian-Lithuanian border.
</P>
<P>
Grodno regional prosecutor Leonid Tereshchenko told reporters
that Sheremet, who has been in detention for more than two months,
could be released in one or two weeks after "investigation
materials come to the prosecutor's office."

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Thai Military Leaders Meet in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- General Chi Haotian,
vice-chairman of the Chinese Central Military Commission, met with
with General Mongkon Ampornpisit, supreme commander of the Armed
Forces of Thailand, here today.
</P>
<P>
Chi, also state councillor and minister of national defense,
while extending his welcome, said he believed that Mongkon's
ongoing visit will surely serve to expand the existing friendly
ties between the two countries and their armies, and help increase
the unity and cooperation between the two armies.
</P>
<P>
The frequent exchange of visits between leaders of the two
armies has laid a good basis for developing bilateral friendly
ties in various fields, he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the future, Chi said, both armies should reinforce exchanges
at all ranks and levels, and in all fields in a bid to pass on the
family-like friendship from generation to generation.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said that as for international and regional
affairs, the people of the two nations have sympathized with,
supported and helped each other, and made positive contributions
to safeguarding regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
The two countries share identical or similar views on many
major international and regional issues, he added.
</P>
<P>
Chi briefed the Thai supreme commander on China's economic
development, army building and the recent 15th National Congress
of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Supreme Commander Mongkon expressed the
hope to further promote the friendly cooperative relations between
the two countries and the two armies.
</P>
<P>
Lieutenant General Kui Fulin, deputy chief of General Staff of
the Chinese People Liberation Army (PLA), was among those present
at the meeting.

<HEADLINE> China to Further Cooperate with Other Countries on Environment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China has made remarkable
progress in environmental protection over the past few years, and
will continue to cooperate with other counties so as to further
improve its environment.
</P>
<P>
Chinese State Councilor Song Jian made the remarks here today
while addressing the opening ceremony of the First Meeting of
the Second Phase of China Council for International Cooperation on
Environment and Develoment.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made new achievements in environmental
legislation.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese National People's Congress (NPC) promulgated the
"Law on the Prevention and Control of Noise Pollution of the
People's Republic of China" in October 1996, marking the basic
completion of the legal system on the prevention and control of
water, gas, noise and solid waste pollution, said Song, who is
also chairman of the State Council's Environmental Protection
Committee.
</P>
<P>
However, China still faces serious challenges for its
environmental protection, he noted, and the goal set by the
Chinese government for the year 2000 is to curb the trend of
environmental pollution and ecological degradation with
improvement of environmental quality in some cities and regions
in the country.
</P>
<P>
Xie Zhenhua, director of the State Bureau of Environment
Protection of China, briefed the participants on the country's
achievements in biodiversity protection, pollution control,
cleaner production, and the implementation of certifications by
the international environmental system.
</P>
<P>
Xie said China has established 800 nature reserves throughout
the country with a total area of 71.85 million
hectares. They account for about 7.2 percent of the Chinese
territories, higher than the world average. Twelve nature reserves
have joined the International Man and Biosphere Reserve Network.
</P>
<P>
Established in 1992, the China Council for International
Cooperation on Environment and Development is composed of senior
officials and scholars from at home and abroad, and intended
to explore new ways of international cooperation in environmental,
economic and social development, sciences and technology, in line with
China's national characteristics.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting is expected to focus on environment and
trade, environmental protection and economic plans, sustained
agricultural advancement as well as the implementation of
international environment conventions.

<HEADLINE> Shenzhen Technician Buys Enterprise Shares With Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Ph.D. Shen Hao recently pledged
his patented technology for a 17 percent share of a newly-founded
paint company in Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
His share is valued at 5.1 million yuan (614,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A local government official said that Shen became the first
student to return to China and use intellectual property rights in
the form of patented technology to buy shares in a state-owned
enterprise.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the development to Jiang Zemin's
Sept. 12 report to the 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China (CPC) encouraging the realization of diversified
forms of public ownership.
</P>
<P>
The two major shareholders in thee high-tech company are
state-owned enterprises in the city.
</P>
<P>
Shen's share-holding position calls for him to provide the
company with patented technology, development programs, technical
upgrades and technological services.
</P>
<P>
Shen, who has since been elected the company's general manager,
graduated from the Chemistry Dept. at the Chinese University of
Science and Technology, and later earned a Ph.D. in Great Britain.
</P>
<P>
Shen, who also worked for research institutes in both Britain
and Norway, has been granted some 30-odd state patents for high
quality specialty paint products which can be used by the
automobile, container, marine engineering and light industrial
sectors.
</P>
<P>
Wang Youming, an official with the Shenzhen Science and
Technology Bureau, said that the city has encouraged the
development of high-tech enterprises by allowing scientists and
technicians purchase to share with patented technology.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the city has listed 20 enterprises as
the units for the reform project on a trial basis.
</P>
<P>
Shenzhen has been a pioneer in China's implementation of
opening-up and moderization over the past decade.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The popular shareholding system
has made its way into the arts sector in China's biggest commercial
center Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
A small performance art troupe has announced that it will adopt
the system to get more funding, and in turn stage better shows, in
keeping with the market economy.
</P>
<P>
"The system will turn the actors and actresses into the real
masters of the troupe. Therefore, they will have a sincere
interest in everything involving the troupe," said Zhang Dongping,
head of the Changning Hu Opera Troupe.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai Opera, or Hu Opera as locals call it, is a typical
kind of local operas performed in Shanghai dialect.
</P>
<P>
According to the new rule, for every new play, the troupe will
buy 52 shares of the total investment, and individual performers
and workers will buy the rest.
</P>
<P>
The profits will be divided among them according to the
box-office revenue, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
At present, China boasts 57,000 theatrical troupes, mostly
government-run. Like state-owned industrial enterprises, many of
them are also losing money.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The State Education Commission
has announced that it will reform the teachers' colleges in China.
</P>
<P>
The plan will target the old-fashioned curriculums, textbooks
and teaching methods, for the purpose of improving the quality of
the country's would-be primary and high school teachers.
</P>
<P>
China has been reforming its primary and high schools for
several years to keep up with the changes in the society. However,
the teachers' colleges in China have remained underdeveloped.
</P>
<P>
The problems include a lack of flexibility and variety in
teaching methods, and the specialities cover narrow knowledge and
fields, according to the reform plan.
</P>
<P>
A feasibility study was completed last month to set the goals
of the reform, and a guiding committee consisting of top-rated
scientists and experts has been formed, commission officials
revealed.
</P>
<P>
The commission is to raise a big sum of funding for the
reform.

<P>
SHANGHAI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shanghai
municipality, the country's biggest economic and financial center,
is picking up its pace to become a comprehensive modern metropolis
as new China enters its 48th year.
</P>
<P>
More than 120 billion yuan (14.46 billion US dollars) has been
injected into the city construction projects during the past half
decade, five times the amount spent in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
From January to June, the city's airport, which has air routes
connecting 97 interior and overseas cities, transported more than
six million passengers, exceeding the number for all of 1992.
</P>
<P>
The import and export volumes of the city's harbor totaled 53
billion US dollars in 1996, 1.6 times more than five years
before. The trade volume of post and telecommunications reached
eight billion yuan (964,000 US dollars) last year, six times the
figure of 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a multiple industrial system, composed of
automobile, metallurgical, telecommunications and bio-engineering
industries and the rich service sector has been formed in this
east China's port city, which used to be solely a textile center.
</P>
<P>
Experts predicted that the per-capita output value of Shanghai
will surpass 3,000 US dollars this year.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the city has also made notable progress in
urbanization of its suburban areas. Large groups of factories
moved from downtown area to the outskirtan areas, making room for
huge theaters, stadiums and recreational centers to be built to
bring in more tourists from both at home and overseas.

<HEADLINE> China Beats Saudi Arabia 1-0 in World Cup Qualifier </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DALIAN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- China beat Saudi Arabia 1-0 in a
rain-soaked Asian qualifying group A match on Friday to keep its
World Cup hopes alive.
</P>
<P>
Defender Zhang Enhua headed the winning ball past goalkeeper
Mohammed Al-Al-Daye in the 69th minute on a corner kick delivered
by midfielder Li Ming.
</P>
<P>
The goal sent about 30,000 Chinese fans at Jinzhou Stadium,
northeastern city of Dalian, into ecstacy as China desperately
needed a victory after drawing away with Qatar and losing home to
Iran in the previous group matches of the Asian Zone World Cup
Qualifying final round.
</P>
<P>
The first half saw the two sides battled evenly in rain. Then
China beefed up offence in the second half to frequently pound the
Saudi Arabian defence and finally found the chance to score.
</P>
<P>
The visitors' best opportunity came in the 82nd minute when the
64th-minute substitute Youssef Al-Thyniyan delivered a free kick
flying just a little high over the bar.
</P>
<P>
Midfielder Khalid Al-Temawi also had a chance in the 33rd
minute from the right in the penalty area but his blast was too
wide.
</P>
<P>
"It was a good match. We showed high speed in switching between
offence and defence," said Chinese coach Qi Wusheng. "All my
players did not relax for one single second through the whole
match. But somehow we put the heavy psychological burden aside."
</P>
<P>
He praised the scorer, saying it is also Zhang who had scored
the first goal with an almost identical header on a same right
corner kick at last year's Asia Cup quarterfinals, where the Saudi
team won 4-3 over China.
</P>
<P>
"China played very well in the second half," Saudi Arabia's
head coach Nilo Vingada said. "We were ready to play this kind of
game, but players are not computers and they could make
mistakes. The whole team was responsible for the loss."
</P>
<P>
"We lost the game but the war (to qualify for the finals in
France) is not lost yet," Vingada added.
</P>
<P>
China now collects four points from one victory, one draw and
one loss, same as Saudi Arabia, who took part in the 1994 World
Cup finals in the United States.
</P>
<P>
The two sides will meet again on November 6, when Saudi Arabia
play as the host.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archeologists Find 5,000-year-old Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered samples of carbonized rice believed to be planted by
people living some 5,000 to 6,000 years ago in the Yellow River
valley.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that ancient rice has been found along
the Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, Chinese people usually planted rice along the
Yangtze River and in southeastern coastal areas, but produced
grain along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The find is thus an important contribution to the study of the
origin and development of Chinese agriculture, the archeologists
said.
</P>
<P>
The rice was discovered in Quanhu village of northwest China's
Shaanxi province, where the archeologists have also found cave
dwellings built by ancient residents, who are believed to have
planted the rice.
</P>
<P>
The round-shaped houses were built half underground, arranged
in parallel lines that spread as far as 50 meters. Pottery jars
and other relics have been unearthed at the site.

<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- UEFA fined Spartak Moscow and
ordered the club to replay its UEFA Cup first round second leg
match with Sion because the goals used in Tuesday's game were too
small.
</P>
<P>
UEFA fined Spartak Moscow 6,800 U.S. dollars Thursday before
the draw for the second round of the competition, a report said.
</P>
<P>
The match will be replayed in Moscow on October 15 and the
winner will play Real Valladolid of Spain.
</P>

UEFA revealed on Friday that the goals were not only too small,
they were also of an irregular height.

Instead of the lower edge of the crossbar being the regulation
height of 2.44 meters above ground, the height of one crossbar
varied between 2.34 and 2.36 meters. The height of the other goal
varied between 2.37 and 2.36 meters.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Archeologists Find 5,000-year-old Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archeologists have
discovered samples of carbonized rice believed to be planted by
people living some 5,000 to 6,000 years ago in the Yellow River
valley.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time that ancient rice has been found along
the Yellow River, the cradle of Chinese civilization.
</P>
<P>
In ancient times, Chinese people usually planted rice along the
Yangtze River and in southeastern coastal areas, but produced
grain along the Yellow River.
</P>
<P>
The find is thus an important contribution to the study of the
origin and development of Chinese agriculture, the archeologists
said.
</P>
<P>
The rice was discovered in Quanhu village of northwest China's
Shaanxi province, where the archeologists have also found cave
dwellings built by ancient residents, who are believed to have
planted the rice.
</P>
<P>
The round-shaped houses were built half underground, arranged
in parallel lines that spread as far as 50 meters. Pottery jars
and other relics have been unearthed at the site.
</P>
<P>
The site belongs to the famous Yangshao Culture, a culture of
the Neolithic period with a well-developed agricultural system
about 6,000 years ago.

nation's most powerful military laser at a 60 million U.S. dollars
Air Force satellite to test its destructive power, the Defense
Department said. The test is expected to take place in New Mexico
in the next few days. Military officials say it will be the first
time that a laser beam has flashed through space to do damage.
</P>
<P>
-- An American who worked for the United Nations in Switzerland
has been convicted of defrauding the organization of half a
million dollars by collecting expenses for nonexistent training

</P>
<P>
The Washington Post

over the plan, as has already occurred with similar rules for
meat. In a related development, South Korea suspended imports of
beef from Nebraska after finding E. coli bacteria in a shipment.

<HEADLINE> Chongqing of China Lists Tourism as Pillar Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHONGQING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Chongqing, China's newly-founded
municipality administrated directly by the central government, has
listed tourism as a pillar industry to promote its economic growth.
</P>
<P>
While continuing to rely on the machine-building,
metallurgical, and chemical industries in economic development,
Chongqing, a major industrial base in southwest China, plans to
stress the development of tourism to reduce environmental
pollution and boost economic growth in its poor rural areas,
municipal officials said.
</P>
<P>
With numerous historical sites and natural scenery such as the
Three Gorges of the Yangtze River and the Stone Carvings at Dazu,
Chongqing has already become a leading tourist attraction in the
country, ranking after Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin in
terms of the domestic tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, the municipality received
114,000 overseas tourists, a year-on-year increase of 38 percent,
and the tourism earnings topped 37 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The Miner Three Gorges alone received 670,000 Chinese tourists
from January to June, a rise of 57 percent.
</P>
<P>
According to a new economic development plan, Chongqing will
raise the proportion of tourism in its GNP value to eight to ten
percent by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
"We'll make great efforts in improving the service of tourism,
enhancing the management, intensifying construction of tourism
facilities, and absorbing overseas funds in tourism development",
said Zhang Delin, Secretary of the Chongqing Municipality
Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
With a population of 30 million, Chongqing became China's
fourth municipality under the central government last March after
being separated from Sichuan Province.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Fluoridate Drinking Water </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa will soon
start a project to have its water supplies fluoridated, the
health department said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement, the department said the South African
government had decided to adhere to the fluoridation regulations
of the World Health Organization and other international bodies.
</P>
<P>
According to visiting American dental consultant Herschel
Horowitz, by regulating the fluoride content of drinking water,
oral decay could be reduced by about 65 percent.
</P>
<P>
Professor Flip Van Wyk of the Pretoria University's dentistry
faculty said the fluoride program would first be implemented in
large cities such as Durban, Pretoria, Johannesburg, Port
Elizabeth and Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of the project was expected to reach 40
percent of the country's population by 2000. In the end, it was
hoped that about 60 percent of the population would have access
to fluoridated water at a cost of about one Rand (one U.S. Dollar
equals 4.7 Rand) per person a year, Van Wyk said.
</P>
<P>
He said it would be difficult to provide this service to
people in remote rural areas because they did not have access to
a central water supply.
</P>
<P>
Fortunately, he said, oral decay among these people was
usually lower than among urban populations who indulged in
western foods.

</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here today from Windhoek quoted a German

</P>
<P>
Mostly from the private sector but with some top-level
government officials, the 60-member delegation will hold talks
with private sector organizations and officials of the 14-member
Southern African Development Community (SADC).
</P>

<HEADLINE> U.S. Command Ship Calls at Hakodate Port </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Seventh Fleet flagship
Blue Ridge called at a civilian port in Hakodate on Japan's main
northern island of Hokkaido this morning, meeting protests by
local antimilitary groups, according to a report reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. navy said the call by the 18,372-ton command ship, the
home port of which is Yokosuka, southwest of Tokyo, aims at
promoting friendship between the two countries, getting supplies
and giving crew members a rest.
</P>
<P>
But local antimilitary labor unions staged a protest rally
around the port, saying the visit is to help with a U.S. request
to allow its military to use the facility if a crisis arises
around Japan.
</P>
<P>
Hakodate is one of the civilian ports the United States hopes
to use in case of an emergency in areas around Japan under the
recently issued new guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Before entering the port, the Blue Ridge and Japanese Maritime
Self-Defense Force destroyer Hamagiri had been jointly conducting
transmission and battle formation exercises.
</P>
<P>
The Blue Ridge visited a Tokyo civilian port last week,
following a series of U.S. military ship visits to Japanese ports
last month.
</P>
<P>
Five U.S. warships, including the command ship Coronado,
aircraft carrier Nimitz, called at Japanese ports last month in an
unprecedented move believed to prepare for use of such ports by
the U.S. military in case of emergencies in areas surrounding
Japan.

<HEADLINE> Maize Shortage Boosts Crop's Futures Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of nearly one
million tons of white maize in countries north of South Africa
and rising drought concerns have prompted conclusions of a record
2,500 futures transactions in September.
</P>
<P>
This was disclosed by the Business Day newspaper today which
said the transactions were worth 160 million Rand (34 million
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Maize futures traders reported increasing demand and
uncertainty due to shortages in countries further north of South
Africa and the impending El Nino phenomenon which traditionally
heralded drought in sub-Saharan Africa.
</P>
<P>
The South Africa Futures Exchange (Safex) said Thursday that
in the third quarter of the year a total of 637,700 tons of maize
was traded, an eight-fold increase over the same period last
year.
</P>
<P>
Prices for maize futures have risen steadily this year.
</P>
<P>
Safex said the price for the September 1997 white maize
contract was 770 Rand (about 165 US Dollars) per ton. It has
risen to 804 Rand (172 US Dollars) for December, 842 (180 US
Dollars) for March 1998 and 820 (176 dollars) for May.
</P>
<P>
In South Africa, an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 tons of maize
was held back by farmers and cooperatives due to fear about the
El Nino effect and hopes of capitalization on rising prices.
</P>
<P>
El Nino, produced by warming of Pacific surface waters off
South America, seems to bite early this year.
</P>
<P>
There were speculations that this year's El Nino could be
worse than that in 1982-83, which caused damage of 13 billion
Dollars worldwide.

the bilateral trade volume has been enjoying a growth of 10 to 15
percent annually in recent years, said Park Yang Chung, South
Korea's consul general to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China, in a message to mark his country's national

relations between Hong Kong and South Korea will become
increasingly closer.

<HEADLINE> Crisis Resumes in South Nigeria's Oil Base </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- An unspecific number of people were
feared dead while serveral others seriously injured in Thursday's
renewed hostilities between youths of two local rival communities in
Warri, an oil producing town in the southern Nigerian state of Delta.
</P>
<P>
Several houses and stores were razed during the feud between Ijaw
and Itsekiri ethnic groups which started around midnight and lasted
till 4:00 in the morning, the Daily Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
Sproradic exchange of gun fire was reported while the rampaging
youths went around burning houses and other structures at a market and
other places of the town.
</P>
<P>
Commercial and other economic activities were immediately paralyzed
as the Warri main market and other business outfits along the main
street were closed to prevent looting.
</P>
<P>
Oil and service companies also shelved the routine movement of
their workers and equipment to installations in the riverine areas or
fear of attacks from the rampaging youths.
</P>
<P>
Following the incident, which broke the fragile peace in the town
in the past three months, the Warri task force beefed
up security by increasing the number of uniformed men at strategic
locations in the city to ward off the rioters and stem the crisis.
</P>
<P>
The clash between the two ethnic groups began in March this year
over the relocation of the headquarters of Warri Southwest Local
Government from Ogbe-Ijoh, an Ijaw settlement, to Ogidigben, owned by
the Itsekiris.
</P>
<P>
The federal government since drafted soldiers to Warri to restore
normalcy while the Delta state government instituted a tribunal to
look into the causes of the constant feud between the three major
ethnic groups, Urhobos, Ijaws and Itsekiris.
</P>
<P>
Some Itsekiri leaders boycotted the tribunal, which was supported
by the federal government.
</P>
<P>
As some of those that appeared before the tribunal accused it of
bias and the state government of causing the fighting, the federal
government promulgated a decree last month, giving it legal backing.
</P>
<P>
Beside Warri, where there was crisis over the relocation of
headquarters of a local government, similar brutal clashes have been
recorded between the Ife and Modakeke communities in Osun state, west
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Serious social problems have aroused the concern of the federal
government.
</P>
<P>
In his national broadcast to mark the country's 37th independence
anniversay, Nigerian head of state General Sani Abacha vowed to crack
down upon criminal activities to protect the life and property of both
Nigerians and foreigners.
</P>
<P>
He however did not reveal concrete measures in this regard, simply
saying that "in keeping with the administration's policy to redress
grievances and to fine-tune policy implementation, steps are now being
taken to review specific issues that have raised genuine concerns."

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Enhance Electric Power Coop with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The governments of Mozambique
and Malawi have signed a memorandum of understanding on putting
up a power transmission line between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum was signed here on Thursday by John Kachamila,
the Mozambican Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources, and
Dumbo Lemani, Malawi's Minister of Energy and Mining, the
Noticias newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The memorandum also sets a date for the signing and
implementing of an inter-governmental agreement by the two
governments and relevant enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Under the memorandum, the transmission line between Cabora
Bassa Dam in Mozambique and Malawi will cost 37 million U.S.
dollars. The project will make it possible for Malawi to import
energy from Mozambique and other signatories of the South
African Energy Network (SAPP). The two countries will also start
their joint fund-raising activities for the project.
</P>
<P>
After the signing ceremony, Kachamila expressed the hope that
an agreement would be reached on power supply from Mozambique to
Malawi. He also hoped that the new transmission line will
benefit both Malawi and the north part of Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The Malawi minister said his country is working hard to build
more hydro-power stations on River Chire, which could also
provide power to the Mozambican side of the common border.
</P>
<P>
According to him, electricity currently consumed in the
Mozambican provinces of Tete, Zambezia and Niassa comes from
Malawi.
</P>
<P>
The Malawi delegation also met Mozambican Prime Minister
Pascoal Mocumbi. The delegatin will visit Songo, Tete province
today to see the Cabora Bassa hydro-power station.

<HEADLINE> Australian Politician Attempts Suicide Over Allowance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australia's leading opposition
party's deputy Senate leader Nick Sherry shocked the nation by
making suicide attempt last night over mistaken travel claims,
local media reported tonight.
</P>
<P>
Sherry was recovering in hospital today from an apparent
suicide attempt after a week of political pressure over the
mistaken travel allowance claims, the Australian Associate Press
(AAP) reported.
</P>
<P>
Senator Sherry, Labor Party's deputy Senate leader, had
detailed his frustration over attacks on him in a hand-written
letter delivered to the AAP early today. The letter raised fears
for his safety which led to police breaking down the door of his
Canberra flat.
</P>
<P>
Inside they found Sherry, 41, covered in blood with his wrists
slashed, AAP said.
</P>
<P>
Local television channel Ten Capital also confirmed the suicide
attempt by Sherry in its evening news today.
</P>
<P>
The Australian government was plunged into a crisis as after
Prime Minister John Howard accepted the resignation of three
government ministers over the alleged claims and cover-up, and
sacked his senior political adviser late last month.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for opposition Leader Kim Beazley said Sherry had
remained conscious and doctors at Canberra Hospital expected him
to make a full recovery.
</P>
<P>
Senator Sherry had been the target of a blistering government
tit-for-tat attack over alleged mistaken travel allowance claims,
centered on 230 US dollar-a-night claims for staying with his
mother at Opossum Bay, near Hobart, capital of the island state of
Tasmania.
</P>
<P>
In his note, written last night, Sherry did not believe the
political attacks on him would end.
</P>
<P>
"So I am taking the appropriate course of action," he wrote.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard, who led the assault on Senator
Sherry, said he was shocked at the news and joined Beazley in
calling for privacy for Sherry's family and said he wished Sherry
a speedy recovery.
</P>
<P>
Senator Sherry, who was reported this morning to be
hospitalized last night suffering from "depression", is one of the
Labor's rising stars. He won the Senate deputy leadership after
the Labor's 1996 election loss and became a key figure in the
new-look team under Beazley.
</P>
<P>
Former Administrative Services Minister David Jull and former
Transport Minister John Sharp also resigned on September 24 after
it was revealed that Sharp had secretly repaid almost 9,000
Australian dollars (6480 US dollars) in travel claims.
</P>
<P>
Two days later, Science Minister Peter McGauran resigned after
admitting to parliament Thursday he wrongfully claimed about 1,008
US dollars in travel allowances from 1996.

<HEADLINE> Two Foreign Firms in Kenya Given Power Generating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has
issued power generating licenses to two foreign companies as a
part of on-going liberalization of the country's energy sector,
according to a Daily Nation report today.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Kenyan Energy Minister Kirugi M'Mukindia
presented the licenses Thursday to representatives of Iberafrica
and Westmoni Ltd.
</P>
<P>
The minister defended the two companies against claims that
they were irregularly awarded the tenders to put up private power
generating plants in the East African country.
</P>
<P>
The criteria used in awarding the two contracts has been a
bone of contention between the Kenyan government and the
International Monetary Fund who has argued that seven-year supply
period is too short and the unit cost is too high.
</P>
<P>
M'Mukindia disclosed that his ministry was negotiating with
two other international power generating companies for providing
an additional 139 megawatts (mw) to the national grid under similar
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the liberalization of electricity
generation is part of efforts by the Kenyan government to
redress the current imbalance, leading to power rationing and
frequent black-outs in the country.
</P>
<P>
The Iberafrica's plant in Nairobi and Westmoni's floating
diesel barge on Kipevu and Mombasa, currently contribute 88.5 MW to
the national grid.
</P>
<P>
The national peak demand for electricity is estimated at 744
MW while the current local supply capacity stands at 661 MW.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has drawn a five-year power development program which
aims at providing 338 MW in additional electricity power
generation capacity by the year of 2002.

<HEADLINE> Russia to React If Russia-NATO Charter Contradicted: Yeltsin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin said
today that Russia will react if the newly signed Founding Act on
Russia-NATO relations is contradicted by NATO policy.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the French television FR3, Yeltsin
suggested the building of a greater Europe fully embracing Russia
but without the interference of "an uncle coming from outside."
</P>
<P>
"If NATO conducts a policy which contradicts with the terms of
the Founding Act, we will react," he said.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin is due to attend the summit of European heads of state
and government, which will be held on October 9-10 in Strasbourg,
France.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the first meeting of the Permanent Russia-NATO Council
held on September 26 in New York, since the signing of the
Russia-NATO Charter, or Founding Act, on bilateral relations in May
in Paris.
</P>
<P>
He said that the New York meeting had allowed both sides to
discuss many issues and had yielded results.
</P>
<P>
"That gives the reasons to hope that the process (of NATO
expansion) will go ahead in a constructive way. At the same time we
want that NATO transforms itself into a political organization, into
an organization in charge of peace... That will make it easy for
all," said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
He warned that if NATO moves in the opposition direction, Russia
will consider organizing "another kind of bloc of the East,"
although Russia does not need it and is not interested in it right
now.
</P>
<P>
"In the contrary case, we should think again about another kind
of bloc of the East, but we don't need it and it does not interest
us," said the Russian president.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin praised France and Germany for adopting a "prudent"
attitude toward NATO eastward expansion, to which Moscow remains
firmly opposed in principle.
</P>
<P>
He said that although the Founding Act did not give Russia the
right to veto NATO decision, Russia has the right to supervise the
process of NATO expansion which was kicked off by the NATO Madrid
summit in July with the admission of Poland, Hungary and Czech
Republic by the Western military alliance.

<HEADLINE> Diana's Bodyguard to Return to England </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Trevor Rees-Jones, the bodyguard of
late Princess Diana, will return to England today, said hospital
sources today.
</P>
<P>
The sole survivor in the mid-night car crash which killed Diana
and two others, Rees-Jones told police Thursday more about the
events which took place in the night of August 30, just before the
crash.
</P>
<P>
But police said he was still hazy about the situation around the
crash itself in the early morning of August 31.
</P>
<P>
Police said that he "vaguely" recognized a couple of
photographers now under judicial investigation for pursuing Diana.
</P>
<P>
Rees-Jones was more "verbose and more exact" in his answers
than the first time he spoke to an examining magistrate about the
crash, Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Hospital officials kept secret the health situation of Rees-Jones
-- who suffered from facial injury and pulmonary and brain contusion
-- as well as the way he will leave France.
</P>
<P>
But a medical source told AFP that he will leave by helicopter
from a heliport outside Paris for an unspecified destination in
Britain.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Urges Cabinet to Do More on Deregulation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto today urged his cabinet ministers to try their best on
economic deregulation and other economic restructuring efforts.
</P>
<P>
"Economic structural reform led by deregulation is one of the
most important assignments for this cabinet," Hashimoto was quoted
by a Kyodo News Agency report as saying this morning.
</P>
<P>
The entire cabinet, he told a meeting of the ministers, "needs
to exhaust efforts to bring forward the timing of implementations
(of existing related plans) and add new measures."
</P>
<P>
Koji Omi, director general of the Economic Planning Agency,
told the meeting that the government needs to push the structural
reforms further to boost the economic momentum.
</P>
<P>
It needs to take more deregulatory steps in six fields, such as
high-tech information and communications, the distribution and
financial industries, Omi reportedly said.
</P>
<P>
Also at the cabinet meeting, International Trade and Industry
Minister Mitsuo Horiuchi warned that "the state of the (Japanese)
economy does not warrant any optimism."
</P>
<P>
The government should engineer an economic growth that is based
on domestic demands, he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Exports Increase in July: Central Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The slide in the value of the
baht helped spur year-on-year export growth of 24.2 percent in
July, with the current account showing a relatively stable level,
according to the Bank of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
After discounting the effects of the 16.3 percent depreciation
of the baht in July, the nominal increase of exports was 8.9
percent compared to those in the same period of last year, the
bank announced recently.
</P>
<P>
Exports were led by high-technology products such as vehicles
and parts, transformers, telecommunication products, electronic
circuits, plastics, chemicals and canned food.
</P>
<P>
For the first seven months, exports grew by 6 percent compared
with those for the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The imports in July increased by 9.1 percent compared with the
same month of last year, with imported cars and luxury products
dropping by 24.1 percent and capital goods imports by 16.5
percent, the bank said.
</P>
<P>
The July trade and current account deficits stood at 22 billion
baht (628 million U.S. dollars) and 20.5 billion baht (585 million
dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
"If this trend is sustained, the total current account deficit
for the year would be around 5.2 percent of gross domestic
product, or just slightly below, Kleothong Hetrakul, director of
the central bank's economic research department was quoted
Wednesday by local press as saying.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund has set a target for the
Thailand's current account deficit this year at 5 percent of GDP.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Calls for "Greater Europe without Uncle from Outside" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, October 3 (Xinhua) -- In a clear reference to the United
States, Russian President Boris Yeltsin today called for the
building of a greater Europe without the interference of "an uncle
coming from outside".
</P>
<P>
In an interview with French television channel FR3 and the
Russian television ORT on the eve of his trip to Strasbourg, France,
to attend a summit of European states next week, the Russian
president also suggested elaborating a "charter of European
security," an idea first put forward by France.
</P>
<P>
"Europe without Russia is not Europe. It is only with Russia
could it become a greater Europe, unequaled on the surface of the
earth," said Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
"We are going to define what is Europe which will enter in the
21st century, and it is in this goal that all the chiefs of state of
Europe have decided to meet in Strasbourg and express their point of
view," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian president said that there is no reason to fear
"whichever country in this Europe embracing Russia," and called
on all Europeans to "unite in the greater Europe without division
line and find a common basis, a platform of union."
</P>
<P>
"We ourselves are capable of uniting ourselves in Europe
seriously and living normally so that our peoples live in security,
prosperity and peace. We don't need any uncle coming from
outside,''said the Russian president.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that all European countries put their ideas together
in a charter of European security, "whose objective is to create a
greater united Europe, a Europe without division lines."
</P>
<P>
France proposed the signing of a European security charter, which
does not have the binding power of a treaty, a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
French President Jacques Chirac proposed a privileged
European-Russia partnership when he visited Russia last week.

<HEADLINE> Thailand's Balance of Payments Record Huge Deficit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand's balance of payments
in August recorded a larger deficit from 51.5 billion baht (1.4
billion U.S. dollars) a month earlier to 146.1 billion baht (4.17
billion dollars), according to a Bank of Thailand (BOT) spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The increase was mainly because of the continued lack of
capital inflow and corporate foreign loan repayments, Kleothong
Hetrakul, director of economic research at BOT was quoted by
Wednesday's local newspapers as saying.
</P>
<P>
She noted that since the baht floatation, foreign investors are
still reluctant to channel their money back to Thailand as they
have no confidence in the economic fundamentals, political
stability or the measures announced to handle economic problems.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, corporations that have borrowed from overseas have
rushed to repay these loans, for fear that the baht might fall
further against the U.S. dollar and consequently increase their
debt burden, she said.
</P>
<P>
Capital outflows in the first seven months were recorded at
352.5 billion baht (10.07 billion dollars), 127.2 billion baht
(3.6 billion dollars) of which was sent out of the country by
non-bank companies.
</P>
<P>
The outflows were in a more serious situation during July and
August, after the flotation, totaling 197.6 billion baht (5.6
billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Leader Leaves for Singapore </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- First Secretary of Myanmar's
State Law and Order Restoration Council (SLORC) Lieutenant-General
Khin Nyunt left here today for Singapore to attend a joint
economic committee meeting between the two countries to promote
economic cooperation, trade and investment.
</P>
<P>
The first meeting of the Joint Ministerial Working Committee on
Promotion of Economic Cooperation, Trade and Investment was held
in Yangon, capital of Myanmar, in January last year, jointly
chaired by Khin Nyunt and Yeo Cheow Tong, Singapore Minister of
Trade and Industry.
</P>
<P>
During the first meeting, the two sides discussed cooperation
in hotel and agricultural sectors as well as cooperation
opportunities in human resources development. The two sides also
reached a new aviation accord amending the old one signed in 1976.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar and Singapore initiated an agreement on bilateral
economic cooperation during a visit to Singapore by Myanmar SLORC
Chairman Senior-General Than Shwe in June 1995.
</P>
<P>
In March 1994, Singapore Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong visited
Myanmar, prompting a large volume of Singapore investment pouring
in the country.
</P>
<P>
By the end of July this year, Singapore's investment in Myanmar
amounted to 1.2 billion U.S. dollars in 56 projects covering
hotels and tourism, industrial zone and container terminals as
well as the industrial sectors.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's investment ranked the second after the United
Kingdom in Myanmar's 6.36-billion-dollar total foreign investment
from 22 countries and regions, according to official statistics.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan Government Committed to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Kenyan government has urged
the Kenya Tea Development Authority (KTDA) to give maximum
support to small-scale tea farmers to ensure increased
production, the Daily Nation reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Agriculture Minister Darius Mbela was quoted as saying
that small-scale farmers could increase their yields
significantly if they improved the use of fertilizer and adopt
better harvesting techniques.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking at the KTDA's annual growers
conference held here Thursday. He said that the government had
liberalized the tea sub-sector of small holders so as to give tea
growers powers to manage their affairs.
</P>
<P>
KTDA sold all its shares in small-holder tea factories to
farmers, and the 44 small-holder tea factories had their own
boards of directors to ensure greater control of the industry by
the producers, Mbela added.
</P>
<P>
The Kenyan government also gave powers to the tea industry in
allowing it to manage tea cess for improving roads and the KTDA
has undertaken an expansion program for small-holder tea
factories.
</P>
<P>
If completed, the minister said, the program would enable
these factories to increase their annual processing capacity to
655 million kilograms from 555 million kilograms at present.
</P>
<P>
According to Mbela, tea production in the first half of this
year is 27 percent lower than in the same period of last year and
the production for 1997 is estimated to decline owing to
prolonged drought suffered late last year and early this year in
the tea-producing areas.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's share of the world tea market has increased from 5.5
percent to nearly 17 percent in the last 25 years and the tea
industry has become the country's leading foreign exchange
earner, accounting for 20 percent of Kenya's total export
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exports tea to more than 40 foreign countries including
the United Kingdom, Pakistan, Egypt, Ireland, Sudan and
Netherlands.

<HEADLINE> 52 ADF Rebels Killed in W. Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- A total of 52 rebels of the
Allied Democratic Forces ( ADF) were killed in a mop-up operation
in western Uganda from Tuesday night to Wednesday, local media
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Report from the scene of the battle said government troops
launched their operation at around 08:00 pm, and overran a
hideout in a deep forest in Bugoye sub-county, Kasese District.
</P>
<P>
The hideout, surrounded by a plantation of sugar cane, banana
and cassava, was used to be a source of water and food for the
ADF rebels, a field commander told The New Vision.
</P>
<P>
The hideout had been deserted when it was found by the
government troops. On Wednesday morning, ADF rebels fell into an
ambush when they returned.
</P>
<P>
The rebels escaped in a hurry, carrying away only the chopped
heads of their dead colleagues and leaving the bodies in the
field to avoid too much harassment, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
Charles Angina, Operation Coordinator in west Uganda, put the
death toll of the government troops at two, and the civilian
victims at 29.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the Ugandan army was reinforcing its
deployment in the west of the country. President Yoweri Museveni
has promised to put down ADF rebellion and said earlier that
3,000 additional soldiers would be deployed in the region.
</P>
<P>
ADF is a rebel group operating in west Uganda. It had some
1,500 fighters in its ranks up to last November, but now it
shrank to 450 members, according to a recent report.

<HEADLINE> Indian Satellite Switched Off, Likely Be Abandoned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, October 3 (Xinhua) -- India's most advanced
communication satellite Insat-2d, which was launched on June 4 by
the French Ariane-4 rocket, was switched off indefinitely on
Thursday following a major power failure, the local press said
today.
</P>
<P>
Due to the power failure, the satellite lost its earth lock, a
mechanism that directs the satellite towards the earth, crippling
the normal functioning of on-board transponders of the satellite.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) said
the satellite might have to be abandoned soon as it now depended
on only one out of the two power buses, and it would not be
possible to pull on for long that way.
</P>
<P>
This is likely to throw operations of India's national stock
exchange out of gear and upset expansion plans of telephone and
television networks, observers said.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very serious problem," a senior ISRO official was
quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Insat-1c launched in July 1988 had to be abandoned in
November 1989 due to a similar power failure.

<HEADLINE> Export Target for 1997-98 to Be Achieved: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan's Export Promotion
Bureau is to introduce non-traditional items in the world market
to meet the challenges in the export sector.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Hasinuddin Ahmed, Director General of the
Export Promotion Bureau, during a press conference Thursday in
Multan, southern part of Punjab province.
</P>
<P>
The Pakistani government has set the export target of 9.5
billion US dollars for the 1997-98 fiscal year. However, the
export sector has been facing tough challenges recent years.
</P>
<P>
"Although we have been facing difficult targets to be achieved,
still we believe that we would be able to enhance our exports to
the tune of 9.5 billion dollars during the current year," Ahmed
was quoted by a local press report today as saying.
</P>
<P>
He believed that these targets could only be achieved if the
Export Promotion Bureau enhances its working by manifold with a
strategy to explore world market for Pakistan's non-traditional
export items.
</P>
<P>
According to Ahmed, the Export Promotion Bureau is planning to
hold around 60 seminars, exhibitions and workshops during this
fiscal year at home and abroad focusing on the need for
export-oriented studies with high vigor.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Thai Military Leaders Hold Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Fu Quanyou, Chief of General
Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA), held talks
with Mongkon Ampornpisit, supreme commander of the Armed Forces of
Thailand, here this morning.
</P>
<P>
They agreed that both countries, as friendly and close
neighbors, would further promote the friendly and cooperative ties
between the defense departments and armed forces of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Fu said since the establishment of diplomatic relations, China
and Thailand have conducted fruitful exchanges and cooperation in
various fields.
</P>
<P>
"We appreciate the 'one China' policy adopted by the Thai
governments under different premierships," he said.
</P>
<P>
Fu said he hoped both sides will continue to strengthen
contacts and further enhance mutually beneficial cooperation in
exchanges between military academies, and in personnel training,
army building and military technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
Fu noted that General Secretary Jiang Zemin of the Chinese
Communist Party (CPC) Central Committee made a solemn statement at
the recent 15th National Congress of the CPC that China will cut
its armed forces by another 500,000 in the next three years.
</P>
<P>
This indicates that the PLA is an army working for peace and
this strategic measure is certainly conducive to world peace and
regional stability, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Fu briefed Mongkon on China's foreign policy, domestic
situation and army building.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Mongkon thanked Fu for inviting him to visit
China.

Mongkon said that both countries share identical or similar
views on many issues and that he hoped the two countries and the
two armies will further their friendly relations and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Fu on Thailand's domestic situation and army
building.
</P>
<P>
Among those present at the talks was Kui Fulin, deputy chief of
General Staff of the PLA.
</P>

guard.

<HEADLINE> Canada Recalls Its Ambassador From Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Canada has recalled its
ambassador to Israel to protest against the reportedly use of
forged Canadian passports by Israeli agents who tried to kill
Hamas member in Amman last week, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
The radio quoted Canadian officials as saying that Canada has
taken a grave view of the matter after determining neither the
two attackers were Canadian nationals.
</P>
<P>
Israeli ambassador to Canada David Sussan was also summoned
by the Canadian Foreign Ministry on Thursday to explain the
case to the Canadian authority.
</P>
<P>
The two attackers holding the Canadian passports are being
held now by the Jordanian authority.
</P>
<P>
Hamas (The Islamic Resistance Movement) leader Khaled
Mashal was attacked by "two Canadian tourists" on September 25
in Amman and later admitted to a secure Jordanian military
hospital for treatment.
</P>
<P>
The two attackers were arrested by the Jordanian police.
Initial investigations showed that they are not Canadian
nationals, but members of the Israeli security service "Mossad."
</P>
<P>
Following the incident in Amman, Izz-Edding Al-Qassam Brigades,
a military wing of Hamas, vowed to attack Israeli interests in
different parts of the world.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli security service has also promised to investigate
this matter, saying anyone behind it would be punished.

<HEADLINE> Crime Rate Rises in NZ </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Crime rate in New Zealand has
risen for the third year in a row, show figures released by the
Police today.
</P>
<P>
For the year ending June 30, the number of offenses increased
by 2.05 percent to over 526,000. On average, there were a violent
crime every two hours and six robberies and 10 burglaries for each
hour in the country.
</P>
<P>
But it is homicide which saw the highest rise of 38.6 percent
from 119 to 165. Among these cases, murders picked up from 51 to
74 with the remaining being manslaughter, attempted murders and
infanticides.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Police Commissioner Barry Matthews attributed the higher
homicide cases partly to the massacre in the central North Island
village of Raurimu, which claimed six lives, and to the laying
more manslaughter charges in relation to road smashes.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Get Tough with Drunken Drivers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Traffic authorities in
Gauteng, South Africa's biggest province, have said that they
would not show mercy for drunken drivers and road hogs.
</P>
<P>
Launching "Arrive Alive" campaign on Thursday, Paul Mashatile,
a senior official responsible for transport and public works in
the provincial government said, "The time for polite warnings is
over."
</P>
<P>
In 1996, 10,000 people died on the roads in South Africa,
2,000 of them in Gauteng province.
</P>
<P>
Among the measures announced by Mashatile are the enforcement
of the new legal alcohol limit of 0.05 percent, down from the
previous limit of 0.08 percent; the acceptance of breathalyser
tests as evidence in court and the introduction of roadside
traffic courts.
</P>
<P>
The new limit means that in the past three drinks were
allowed before the legal limit was reached, now the taking of a
single drink could spell trouble.
</P>
<P>
According to traffic department sources, first offenders face
a three-month licence suspension together with fines and or jail
terms. Second-time offenders can have their licences suspended
for up to five years.
</P>
<P>
The "Arrive Alive" will focus on drunken driving this month,
on speeding next month and in December and January there will be
a crack-down on drunken driving, speeding and people driving
without seat belts.
</P>
<P>
In addition to Gauteng Province, the Western Cape Province,
Kwazulu Natal Province and Mpumalanga will also be involved in
the campaign, Mashatile noted.
</P>
<P>
South Africa is administratively divided into nine provinces.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh's Fish Production Still Short of Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh's fish production is
yet to meet the yearly demand although it has showed an upward
trend over the past years, a press report said today.
</P>
<P>
According to sources from the Fisheries Department, this South
Asian country is facing a shortfall of about 0.95 million tons of
fish a year against the minimum requirement of around 2.35 million
tons.
</P>
<P>
At present, the sources stated, the per capita fish production
of the country is estimated at 25 grams a day as against the
minimum requirement of 75 grams.
</P>
<P>
The country's fish production increased by about 60 percent in
the last eight years, rising from 847,000 tons in the 1989-90
fiscal year to 1.373 million tons in 1996-97 with an average
annual growth rate of 5-8 percent, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
Output in 1996-97 was about 1.364 million tons, up 8 percent
from the previous fiscal year, the sources noted.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total output of 1996-97, about 1.07 million tons of
fish came from inland waters and the rest 0.294 million tons from
marine waters.
</P>
<P>
The sources attributed the country's fish production increase
to the application of modern technology.
</P>
<P>
But they pointed out that fish production has been badly
affected by the use of pesticides in crop production in recent
years.
</P>
<P>
The country has about 4.05 million hectares of inland waters
and 0.28 million hectares of inland closed waterbodies and
brackish water shrimp farms in the coastal region, the sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The country's marine water in the Bay of Bangal is estimated at
48,365 square nautical miles (about 89,439 square kilometers) with
exclusive economic zone extending up to 200 nautical miles (about
370.60 kilometers) from the base line.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Vice-President Opposed to Tribalism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Tribal sentiments would
undermine peace the country has enjoyed for the past three decades,
Tanzanian Vice-President Omar Ali Juma has said.
</P>
<P>
At a Colloquium on Culture of Peace here on Thursday, Juma said
Tanzania is not happy with the proliferation of ethnic strife in the
sub-region because it could fragilize the peaceful
situation in the country.
</P>
<P>
He decried the habit of some people of fanning tribal sentiments
or racism as a means to achieve political ends.
</P>
<P>
Juma warned that resposibility of safeguarding peace in the
country lay on every citizen and not the government alone, saying
it is imperative that the people be told to be wary of politicians
who mix racism or religion.
</P>
<P>
He called on political parties to nurse a culture of tolerance
with leaders setting practical examples to their supporters,
insisting that political opposition does not mean hostility, enmity
or quarrel.

DAR ES SALAAM, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Tanzania is expected to

sector which was announced in May this year by Abdallah Kigoda,

of under the act.

<HEADLINE> Australian Wool Prices Tumble After Weeks of Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Australian wool prices tumbled
this week, ending four strong weeks of growth, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
The benchmark Wool International eastern market indicator fell
23 cents to 699 Australian cents (503 U.S. cents) a kilogram at
the close of the week's sales.
</P>
<P>
"The change in the composition of offerings from the superfine
selection of the previous week to a more normal selection of wool,
representative of the clip as a whole which is typically found in
Sydney and Melbourne sales, was the principal factor responsible
for the downward movement in prices," the Australian Council of
Wool Exporters said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Wesfarmers Dalgety expected prices to stabilize in a month's
time despite the weak outlook caused by less stylish and cheaper
wool dominating the bales on offer.
</P>
<P>
"Next week this scenario will remain, adding further downward
pressure to prices," Wesfarmers Dalgety said in its Wool Weekly
bulletin.
</P>
<P>
"However, weakness is only expected in the immediate term with
tabilization likely beyond this."
</P>
<P>
Sales continue next week in Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle with
about 97,800 bales rostered for auction.

WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Secretary
William Daley is leaving here for China Friday on a visit designed
to forge a long-term cooperative commercial relationship with
China.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Daley told a press conference that his visit
"should send a message that the United States is committed to
being involved and also being active in the Chinese market for the
long term, not the short term."
</P>
<P>
He and Chinese Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation Minister
Wu Yi will co-chair in Beijing the 11th session of the U.S.-China
Joint Commission on Commerce and Trade (JCCT) established in 1983.
</P>
<P>
"We are not here for quick access and big money deals but
rather for the tremendous long-term opportunities that exist in
the market that will bring about economic prosperity in China and
create jobs in the United States," said the secretary, whose trip
is timed about three weeks ahead of Chinese President Jiang
Zemin's visit to the United States.
</P>
<P>
He said his meetings with Chinese officials will also help set
the stage for the upcoming visit of President Jiang, scheduled for
late October.
</P>
<P>
The issues he is going to discuss with Chinese officials
include China's admission to the World Trade Organization (WTO),
bilateral trade and commercial law enforcement.
</P>

<HEADLINE> ADB Okays Loan for Bangladesh Railway Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
has approved a 110-million-U.S.-dollar loan for a railway project
linking Bangladesh's less developed northwestern region with its
more developed east, the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
At present, cargo and passengers must be taken by ferry from a
train line on one side of the Jamuna River to another line on the
other side, creating a severe bottleneck.
</P>
<P>
The railway project includes the building of a bridge and the
addition of a dual-gauge track along the lines so that trains can
travel the 99 kilometers without interruption.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to generate a substantial volume of new
freight traffic, including the products of the coal and hard rock
mines in the region.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the project will also help streamline Bangladesh
Railway, the executive agency, to make it more efficient.
</P>
<P>
The total cost of the project is estimated at 269 million
dollars, of which 117.6 million dollars will be provided by the
Bangladesh government.
</P>
<P>
Of the remainder, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting
Countries will provide 15 million dollars, the Spanish government
11.4 million dollars and the French government 8 million dollars.
The Export Development Corp of Canada is expected to provide 7
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ADB loan, which is interest-free and carries a 1-percent
annual service charge, is repayable over 40 years, including a
10-year grace period.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Zealand PM Tries to Reassert Leadership </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, October 3 (Xinhua) -- New Zealand Prime Minister
Jim Bolger has signaled that more state assets could be privatized
in an effort to try to pump fresh life into his unpopular
government and thus reassert his leadership.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the Auckland Chamber of Commerce Thursday,
Bolger raised the prospect of further privatization of health,
education and welfare services and reform of the government-owned
Accident Rehabilitation and Compensation Insurance Corporation,
the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
He told the business circle that he believed it was "springtime
again" in New Zealand.
</P>
<P>
"We are asking the question: are busy ministers the right
people to run property companies, airports, coal companies (and)
television companies and so on?" he said. "The answer is 'no'."
</P>
<P>
He said greater private sector and community participation is
necessary to deliver social policy today, be it in health,
education, welfare, accident compensation or employment support.
</P>
<P>
Bolger added that the economy and business confidence have
turned the corner and the government is in the midst of the most
extensive review of its activities since his National Party came
to power in 1990.
</P>
<P>
His speech is widely seen as a scene-setter for the next stage
of the government and an answer to his critics who are suggesting
that it is time for a change of leader.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 months since the coalition of the National Party
and New Zealand First was formed, the government has been beset
with troubles created internally, causing government popularity to
plunge.
</P>
<P>
A latest opinion poll showed that support rate for the
opposition Labor Party was over 50 percent, while that for the
National Party was 28 percent and that for New Zealand First only
1 percent.
</P>
<P>
Bolger is now trying to revive the government's popularity by
delivering the message of stopping ructions and getting down to
business.
</P>
<P>
But Bolger's strategy is likely to put his party in conflict
with New Zealand First, which insists that strategic assets like
TVNZ are not for sale.
</P>
<P>
The Coalition Agreement listed TV1 as a strategic asset not to
be sold to private interests and TV2 will be retained in public
ownership, though private sector executives could manage it.
</P>
<P>
Observers believe that if Bolger wants his plan to go ahead,
the Coalition Agreement needs to be renegotiated.
</P>
<P>
Reports said business people had told Bolger to ditch New
Zealand First as coalition partner, which was blamed for almost
all the troubles within the government.
</P>
<P>
Bolger's speech also represents an effort to relaunch his prime
ministership. Bolger has been criticized by some national MPs who
think he lacks direction of leadership and have been talking about
a change of leader.

<HEADLINE> China's Aviation Industry to Cut Jobs by 150,000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- State-owned Aviation Industries
of China (Avic) will lay off 150,000 surplus employees from their
present jobs and channel them to other jobs by the end of the
century, according to an Avic working conference last month.
</P>
<P>
The decision will affect about one-fifth of the workforce in
this sector, today's China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
Avic calls this a strategic measure to promote efficiency and
enable it to accomplish its goal for 2000.
</P>
<P>
This is an important measure for deepening the reform of State
industries.
</P>
<P>
By 2000, Avic will have no more than 500,000 people under its
administrative and key corporate arms by 2000.
</P>
<P>
A maximum of 200,000 workers will be required for aircraft
production.
</P>
<P>
In 2000, it is expected that 10 percent of its companies have
an average sales income of more than 500,000 yuan per employee; 30
percent more than 200,000 yuan; and half more than 100,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
"The people to be laid off from these positions will not be
left to their own devices," said Ren Wei, an Avic official.
</P>
<P>
It is expected they will be re-employed in other jobs created
in the sector.
</P>
<P>
According to the recent 15th National Congress of the Communist
Party of China, reform of state enterprises will be deepened. This
will include opening up state enterprises to public ownership in
diversified forms and finding other jobs for workers surplus to
requirements.

Commenting on a new joint defense treaty signed by the United

The spokesman added Russia still has to see how the new treaty
will affect Russia even though Washington and Tokyo have assured

treaty does not cover Russian territory.

<P>
BEIJING, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Public buses in Beijing are
running under preferential terms, easing the strings brought by an
increasing crowded traffic.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Beijing Daily, apart from designating a
special lane for the public buses on the Chang'an Street, one of
the busiest in the Chinese capital, efforts have been made to open
new routes and prolong the operation time.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics show that the city has added a total of 2,215
kilometers of operating length for the public transport sector
since 1992, and 42 percent of the public buses have extended their
service time.
</P>
<P>
As a result, public bus routes have been extended to 197 of the
city's newly-built residential quarters and nine of the suburban
districts and counties.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the bus service closed at 11 p.m. in the city and
7 p.m. in the suburbs. Now, the time has been prolonged to 12
p.m. and 9 p.m. respectively.
</P>
<P>
The city has also added 18 special bus routes leading to 68
tourist attractions over the past two years.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, October 3 (Xinhua) -- More and more people from this
prosperous city in south China are planning to travel overseas.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, more than one million people from
Guangzhou have gone out of the boundary to do business, engage in
sightseeing and visit relatives.
</P>
<P>
When the city began to open to the outside world in 1983, the
citizens could only visit Hongkong and Macao. Now tourist
destinations have been extended to Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand,
the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Travel to the European countries, the US, Canada, Australia,
New Zealand, Japan and the Republic of Korea is also allowed on a
trial basis.
</P>
<P>
While outbound travelers could only ask their overseas
relatives or friends to buy bills for them at the beginning, now
most of them pay the tours by themselves, since travel agencies
from 1989 began to accept local payments.
</P>
<P>
Of the one million outbound tourists in the past five years,
over 110,000 went out of the country for business talks, study
tours, professional training, exhibitions and trade fairs.

<P>
JAKARTA, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Indonesian President Soeharto
said the government is striving to overcome a monetary crisis as
well as forest fires that have sent a huge cloud of smoke across
Southeast Asia.
</P>
<P>
"We are working as hard as we can to overcome the monetary
jolts ... We are working hard to overcome the ground and forest
fires and the smoke that is spreading everywhere," the president
told a youth organization in Malang, East Java, Thursday, reports
reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian rupiah has depreciated nearly 40 percent since
January, but its sharpest drop began in July when it came under
attack by speculators.
</P>
<P>
The rupiah was trading at 3,450 to the U.S. dollar Thursday
compared with around 2,450 before the currency came under attack
in July.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Jakarta share prices slipped 0.01 percent Thursday
amid lackluster trading hampered by concerns about the weak rupiah
and tightening liquidity.
</P>
<P>
The government was forced last month to either postpone or
review 156 government and state-related projects worth 38 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, fires continue to raze Indonesian forests
although rain has reportedly begun to fall in some parts of North
Sumatra and East Kalimantan.
</P>
<P>
About 300,000 hectares of land and forests in Sumatra and
Kalimantan were estimated to have been scorched by fires in the
last three months.
</P>
<P>
The haze caused by the fires has brought 20 million people in
danger of respiratory problems in the country as well as in
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Many countries have offered assistance to Indonesia in fighting
the haze.

HONG KONG, October 3 (Xinhua) -- South Korean businessmen
regard Hong Kong as a base to expand their markets in China's
inland areas and Southeast Asia, a senior South Korean diplomat
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is now the fourth trading partner of South Korea and
the bilateral trade volume has been enjoying a growth of 10 to 15
percent annually in recent years, said Park Yang Chung, South
Korea's consul general to the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) of China, in a message to mark his country's national
day.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade between South Korea and Hong Kong reached 12
billion U.S. dollars in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is a gateway to markets in China's inland areas and
Southeast Asia and it is also a trade and financial center in the
Asia-Pacific region, Park said. He believed that the trade
relations between Hong Kong and South Korea will become
increasingly closer.
</P>
<P>
There are about 700 South Korean firms in Hong Kong and they
have been operated normally after Hong Kong's return to China on
July 1.

Generally speaking, all the businessmen in Hong Kong are

BANGKOK, October 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai Prime Minister Chavalit
Yongchaiyudh will pay a visit to Japan on October 8-10, during
which he is expected to ask Japanese creditors to extend repayment
terms for debts incurred by Thai firms, government sources said
today.
</P>
<P>
He is also expected to seek cooperation from the Japanese side
for exporting vehicles and automobile parts to third countries.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister will be accompanied by ministers in charge
of economic matters and representatives of the Board of Trade, the
Federation of Thai Industries and the Thai Bankers' Association.
</P>
<P>
Thai private firms have almost 80 percent of the country's
total foreign debts of 97 billion U.S. dollars, of which 50
percent are owed to Japanese creditors, according to the Board of
Investment.
</P>
<P>
Auto parts producers in Thailand are currently operating at
half capacity. It is feared that if the economic downturn
continues through next year, many factories will be forced to
close, laying off thousands of workers. Under such circumstances,
increased exports will be the only way to keep the factories open.

<HEADLINE> Canada Recalls Ambassador to Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, October 2 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian government said
today it has recalled its ambassador to Israel to protest the use
of forged Canadian passports by two suspected Israeli agents.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy made the announcement
while attending meetings in New York.
</P>
<P>
He said that Canada has nothing to do with an apparent attempt
to kill an Islamic leader in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
Khaled Meshal, political chief of the militant Islamic group
Hamas, was assaulted outside his office in Amman, Jordan, last
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The two attackers have been arrested and are reported to be
carrying Canadian passports. In fact, they are said to be agents
of Israel's secret service Mossad.
</P>
<P>
Canada takes "great exception to the use of reputation of
Canadian passports for those kinds of purposes, and we are
recalling our ambassador to Israel back to Ottawa for
consultations on the matter," Axworthy said.
</P>
<P>
In diplomatic terms, recalling an ambassador is a way to
express sharp displeasure with another country, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
David Kilgour, Canadian secretary of state for Latin American
and African affairs, told the House of Commons here today that "it
can be confirmed that the two passports were forgeries."
</P>
<P>
Israel's ambassador to Canada has been summoned to answer
questions about the passport incident, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The latest incident apparently broke a tacit agreement between
Canada and Israel that the latter would bar its secret service
from using Canadian passports after they were caught doing so in
1981.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien said that
it would be totally unacceptable for any foreign spies to use
Canadian passports.
</P>
<P>
There are fears here that the passport incident might lead to
reprisals against Canadians in the Middle East.

<HEADLINE> US to Fire Laser Against Satellite in Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, October 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen today announced a decision to let the Army to fire a
laser beam at an Air Force satellite, the first test of its kind
that critics see as a step toward a new arms race.
</P>
<P>
Defense Department spokesman Michael Doubleday said the test
will be conducted within a few days. The Army will aim a beam at a
small Air Force weather satellite 640 miles (1,075 km) in space
from the Mid-Infra-Red Advanced Chemical Laser, dubbed the MIRACL,
at White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The purpose of the test is to collect data for computer models
used to develop ways to protect U.S. satellites against lasers,
Cohen, who is at a NATO meeting in Europe, said in a statement
issued by his Pentagon office.
</P>
<P>
Doubleday also said today that the test is fully consistent
with U.S. policy and violates no international laws. He defended
the test as a "logical step" in learning how to protect American
satellites against lasers that a hostile nation might one day use.
</P>
<P>
But no nation is known to have ever used a laser against a
satellite in space.
</P>
<P>
The 1967 Outer Space Treaty prohibits putting nuclear weapons
in space and the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty bans the kinds
antimissile defenses in space that former President Reagan's "Star
Wars" idea envisioned in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
In 1985 the U.S. Congress explicitly prohibited the laser test,
but the ban was allowed to expire two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. military has long wanted the capability to disable or
degrade satellites in space to deter other nations from seeking
such a weapon for use against U.S. satellites.
</P>
<P>
However, critics argue that once the United States develops the
capability, or even conducts live tests such as the one Cohen has
approved, a dangerous new arms competition will be created as
other nations do the same.
</P>
<P>
John Steinbruner, a senior analyst at the Brookings
Institution, said the test approved by Cohen signals the world
that the United States is ready to "start the game of destruction
and to legitimize it."
</P>
<P>
Steinbruner called the Pentagon's decision "an unbelievably
foolish judgment."

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denies Deal with Israel on Yassin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, October 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today denied it has a deal
with Israel on the release of the spiritual leader of Hamas Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin in exchange for two alleged Israeli secret agents
arrested in Amman.
</P>
<P>
"There is no deal," King Hussein said after he and Palestinian
National Authority President Yasser Arafat visited the founder of
the radical Islamic Resistance Movement in a hospital.
</P>
<P>
The 61-year-old and ailing Yassin was set free Wednesday by
Israeli authorities on "humanitarian reasons." Sitting in a
wheelchair, he was then flown to Amman for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Yassin, an eloquent preacher, founded Hamas in December 1987
following the outbreak of the Palestinian uprising (Intifada). He
was arrested in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Having served eight years of a life imprisonment for his role
in the death of two Israeli soldiers, Yassin's release came after
two alleged Israeli agents in an assassination attempt against
another Hamas leader were brought under Jordanian police custody.
</P>
<P>
Two tourists carrying Canadian passports attacked Khalid
Mashiel, head of Hamas' political bureau, in front of his office
with a toxic injection on September 25. Mashiel was hospitalized.
</P>
<P>
Israel's intelligence service Mossad was accused of being
behind the murder attempt. Samir Mutawe, Jordan's state minister
for information, has said the suspected Israeli agents will face
trial like any other suspects.
</P>
<P>
Reports here said police are continuing search of their
accomplices. King Hussein said Tuesday that Jordan will never
allow anybody to turn the country into a site of acts of terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Today Hussein told reporters that Yassin's release is hopefully
the beginning of more and similar moves.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said he hoped Israel will free more Palestinians from
its prisons. He called on the United States to safeguard the peace
process by pressurizing Israel to fully implement its signed
agreements.
</P>
<P>
Yassin is reportedly to return to his followers in his homeland
Gaza soon after his treatment in Jordan.
</P>
<P>
This is seen as a positive step taken by the Israeli government
in easing tensions accumulating since Israel's Jewish settlement
expansion in March and suicide Jerusalem bombings in July and
September.
